West London based artist and producer Andy Smith is better known as "Lxury", up-and-coming electronic talent.

The five smashing sounds yet released on his soundcloud leave no doubt concerning his potential to ignite the electronic scene. While an official release is very much awaited, we can't help but notice, among his other tracks, the single "J.A.W.S", co-produced by Disclosure, which illustrates the flavoursome mix between Smith's electronic and dance influences.

A forthcoming debut EP, "Playground EP", is on this year's musical menu. Yet again, London proves to be a cream of the crop reference for infectious electronic sounds.
