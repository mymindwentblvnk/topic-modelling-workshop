The post-hardcore/emo quartet This Means You formed in 2003 in Tel Aviv, Israel. Assi, Ben E., Ran and Ben H. all knew each other from high school and the local club scene.

In early 2006 after releasing their first self titled demo This Means You began performing in main venues throughout Israel. Performing side by side with internationally acclaimed bands such as Man Alive, Useless ID and Betzefer, This Means You were making a name of themselves as one of the driving forces in the Tel Aviv alternative music scene. Standing out in the local landscape, the four-piece group has since forged a wide range of influences to create their own unique sound.

During August 2007 after thorough touring, This Means You finally went into the studio to record their debut studio album “The Act”. Helming the project in the producers chair was Yotam Ben Horin, lead singer and bass player for Israel's punk rock pioneers Useless ID. Within the album, titled "The Act", lies the mix of the aggressive yet melodic sound that became synonymous to This Means You.

In combination with the polished pop-esque production of Ben Horin and yet without compromising their energetic hardcore punk influences and roots, “The Act” can be enjoyed by hardcore/screamo purists as well as the mainstream pop audience. The first single titled “The Bottle” was featured on the internationally distributed “PunkRock.co.il” compilation.
