Fallen Joy is a melodic death metal / black metal from around Paris.  The actual line up exist since march 2009 and is composed of Victor and Julian on guitars, LÃ©andra at the drums, Rudy on bass and Gul on vocals. Their music is as epic and melodic as it is dark and violent to create a form of metal influenced mostly by Gorgoroth, Amon Amarth, Dark Tranquility and Dream Theater ... They've started to play shows around Paris for a while and get a better response from their audience each time.
