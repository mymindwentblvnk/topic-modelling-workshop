Duane Warr (Dwarr) recorded two albums in the early 80's in South Carolina before going totally over the edge in an Alcohol and drug induced frenzy whilst recording his third (unreleased) album. The legend has it that Mr. Warr burned all his gear, mastertapes and remaining copies of the records shortly after the release of "Animals" and became a Christian, but there are some rumors of 2 more CDs from the early 90's released. Also, there seem to be both a 'proper' reissue of the 2 first albums available from Black Widow records as well as a pretty professional looking double-CDR bootleg ("Cannabinol - The Bootleg") circulating. 

This is over-the-top psychedelic doom-metal-insanity -- dark, brooding, and totally whacked out. The sound is somewhat like a retarded drug-addled attempt at SABBATH with insane guitar solos and excursions into the most depressing, suicidal sounds ever laid to tape. The two DWARR LP's are truly some of the strangest metal records of all time. They definitely don't sound like anything else, and the guy comes off as clearly disturbed. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dwarr">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
