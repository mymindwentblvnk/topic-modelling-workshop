Flash Hawk Parlor Ensemble is a project that developed from Chris Funk (of The Decemberists) playing instruments out on his porch.  His neighbours began to notice and join in.
In May 2007 'Plastic bag in the tree' was released on Hush Records.  For the most part it's an instrumental album, featuring covers of artists like Massive Attack, Radiohead and The Pretenders. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Flash+Hawk+Parlor+Ensemble">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
