The gothic metal/symphonic power metal band Magion hailing from the Dutch The Hague/Rotterdam-area was founded in September 2005.

Magion creates powerful, stirring, dark, but always accessible music that matches perfectly with Myrthe’s moving, partly autobiographical lyrics. The elaborately structured songs contain a lot of variation. Fast and tightly executed metal-elements combined with a symphonic approach result in exciting, bombastic episodes that seamlessly pass into atmospheric, sensitive passages. Intriguing guitar solos enrich the overall sound, but leave plenty of room for the mesmerizing vocals that shift effortlessly from a poppy sound to a more classical approach. The vocals are supplemented on some tracks with clean or raw male vocals.

They released their debut album "Close to Eternity" in February of 2010 which can be purchased at their official website, www.magionband.com.

The band split up in 2014, releasing the following statement on their website: "This valentines day, is a day of good bye. As you may have noticed already, last month Menno has left Magion, Last week Chris decided to quit as well and today you may have read Joop his statement of resignation. This unfortunately means the end of Magion as well.We feel that the three of us can never play the music again as it was intended. Since Chris has always been the musical mind of Magion, the music will never sound the same, even if we’d want to continue and start writing again. To our fans and all who have supported us over the years, we say thank you very much for all your support and we regret the fact that things ended so suddenly and that we never got to have a proper goodbye." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Magion">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
