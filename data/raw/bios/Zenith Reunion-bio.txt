Story:

Zenith Reunion was founded first time in early 90´s in Pudasjärvi, Finland in ruins of "Loudspeaker" and "Dead Fish". Name was Zenith and it made one demo-tape and a few gigs. After that the members moved to different cities around the Finland and Zenith had to split up. All those gifted musicians continued playing in different bands. 2010 came a burning need to gather band again by three original members, who now lived in same town, Oulu. They found a pair of very talented musicians along and band was reformed. In the very first gathering they started to compose new songs and some of the old ones got a facelift. So the story of Zenith will continue now by name Zenith Reunion.
