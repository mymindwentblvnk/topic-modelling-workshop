Cancerous Womb are a Death Metal / Grind quartet from Edinburgh, founded in 2008, who focus on delivering a mixture of Modern Death Metal, early Grind / Thrash and a slither of Progressive-Technical influence. With catchy and creative passages and an unconvential approach to song structures, Cancerous Womb captivate audiences with an originally lethal yet highly accessible style of Extreme Death Metal. .
