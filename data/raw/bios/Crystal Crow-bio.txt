Crystal Crow who formed in 2003, released their first EP in October 2004. The music style is some kind of progressive Metal mixed with Gothic elements. Most astonishing is the voice of Singer Dirk "Whych" Bender. From dark shouts to high dark singing parts he shows all the wanna-be's of the metal business what you call a singer.
