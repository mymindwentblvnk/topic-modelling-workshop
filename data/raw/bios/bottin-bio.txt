Bottin (Guglielmo Bottin, 1977) is producer, dj and sound designer based in Venice, Italy

Take a youth spent against a background of old Italian Giallo soundtracks, some also John Carpenter's film music, add in late 70s Italian disco influences, a touch of free and easy west-coast vibe and a smattering of kitsch. That just about half describes Bottin.
