"The idea of Cryptid started in spring 2007, when guitarist Miku and drummer Joel were both in the army and had quite similar musical interests, so they decided to set up some kind of technical death metal project. In fall 2007 it all came possible and they started rehearsing together. Miku had come up with some songs and pretty soon also Ville and Mika joined the band. In 2008-2009 three songs were recorded and now we are finally ready to publish some material. So it’s been a while, but better late than never. Right now we are concentrating on writing some new songs and completing our line-up to get things rolling!"
