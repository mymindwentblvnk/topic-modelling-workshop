There are two groups with this name:
1) Polish electro-gothic
2) black metal project from Spain


1. A Polish electro-gothic act from Poland. The group was founded over 10 years ago but with its present members has been playing only for few months.
Over the years the members of the group have changed and the band have defined its music.
Because of the changes of the musicians, the style and sound of the group have also changed.
But today, after the premiere of the first LP "NEW BETTER EXISTENCE" we can admire the highly developed material, which enjoys a lot of interest.

2. An obscure black metal project from Spain. Formerly called Beheaded Lamb; only a demo titled "Return To The Truth" was released under this name, before the band memebers parted ways. The Beheaded Lamb moniker was re-used by some members, while others formed Gothician. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gorthaur">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
