Somnent is a solo melodic doom/death project that began in Fort Lauderdale, FL. Musical themes include personal struggle, death, nature, and the meaning of life and consciousness. While inspiration comes from an array of sources both musical and non-musical. The debut EP titled “Eventide” was mixed, mastered, and produced by Giovanni A. Vigliotti at Diagnostic Studios during the summer of 2015. Originally the album was released as a digital album on June 26, 2015 but after a positive response, was released on Russian label GS Productions in February 2016 as a limited edition digipack.
