Skelteria was founded by Evan Kotner in 2008. After being screwed over by numerous potential members, Kotner created the character UNIT#24601 to record a demo in 2009 and spent the following years recording "The Nightmare Begins" and "The Green-Fireball-From-Hell Album". With that came a Youtube channel of insane music videos (one of which gained notoriety on failblog), being featured on Fishbowl Radio Network's "Nothing But Metal" and Live365's "THRASHERS", topped off with some raw live performances in Deep Ellum and an apartment in Allen, Texas. Despite continuous setbacks, Skelteria pushes on like Hell to kick ass with metal!!!!! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Skelteria">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
