LOST GRAVITY was formed in London, UK in summer '07 by Brazilian guitarist Breno Val. In a time when the scene was saturated with crappy indie and metalcore bands, LOST GRAVITY brought back what had been missing for ages in the local scene: guitar riffs, melodies and foot tapping grooves! 

Heavily influenced by AC/DC, Metallica and Alice in Chains and not following any musical trends, LOST GRAVITY is one of the few bands around the UK that mix heavy rock, metal and grunge with such originality.
