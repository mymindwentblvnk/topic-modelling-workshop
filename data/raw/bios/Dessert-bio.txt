There are four artists with name Dessert.

1) Omnipresent, superficially saccharine, and catchy, Dessert connect with their target audience in ways parents could never hope to understand or achieve. Dessert speak primarily to the young and disenfranchised with songs of inclusiveness, selflessness, and of purpose. Those willing to look past the glib and market-savvy image of the jpop ensemble will find intelligent, compelling lyrics that can be appreciated on many levels. Dessret are much, much more than the sum of their parts. To their fans, Dessert are a way of life (and of death it seems in Suicide Circle).

2) Now disfunct Heavy metal band from Riga, Latvia, formed in 1989. They have released one EP "Rockin' From Riga" (1990).

3) A Japanese Hardcore band. They released one full-length "soul searching" , one ep "world of fantasy" and appeared a few compilations.  

4) Electronic musician with only a few tracks available. I haven't been able to find much on them but here's there itunes page: https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/devil-single/id1158467358?i=1158467370 <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dessert">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
