Balegard is a "Tavastian Black Metal" hailing from Jyväskylä, central finland.
Formed in spring 2011 by Fornjotr & Varjakainen.

The name Balegard (named by the north-germanics who raided the costal areas of Finland) is thought to mean "encircled by fire", which might refer to the signal beacons ancient Finnic tribes are thought to have used as a warning system.
