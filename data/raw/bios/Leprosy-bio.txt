There are three bands with this name. Leprosy from Mexico which was active with the Ex lead singer of the band  Transmetal "Pimentel." Leprosy from the Paul Green School of Rock in Downingtown, PA. and Als, and finally Leprosy; a punk band from Melbourne Australia playing in the style of UK82 such as Disorder and Finnish punk such as KAAOS.

Leprosy from PA have a sound very similar to Cannibal Corpse's, albeit the vocals are not quite as strong. The general song content is similar. 

Leprosy from Mexico started as a solo project by Alberto Pimentel when he left Transmetal. The band was formed in 1990 and their first CD was released on 1991 keeping the same style as Transmetal although Pimentel used English lyrics instead of Spanish ones.

Leprosy are a hardcore punk band influenced by UK82 and Scandinavian punk from Melbourne, Australia. To date they have released an 09' demo tape and are in the process of releasing a split cassette with Californian Kuro worshipers The Helpless. They are also working on a split 7" with Chicago punks Corpse Gas. Leprosy's lyrical content is largely centered around anti-capitalism, anti-war, anti-religion, anti-fascism and nuclear annihilation.
