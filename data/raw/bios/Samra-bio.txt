In January 2019, Samra was named the winner of the Hiphop.de Award in the Best National Newcomer category.

Samra (then known as Samra45) first attracted attention on the German rap scene in the autumn of 2016 as a guest performer on Alpa Gun's album Zurück zur Straße – particularly on "Chaos", where he criticized 187 Strassenbande. Later that year, he was a featured artist on Mert's "U21". Samra was reportedly approached in 2017 by Farid Bang, who was interested in signing the rapper to his Banger Musik label, but Samra refused. That year, Bushido signed Samra to his EGJ label.

In April 2018, Samra released his first track in a year. The single, "Rohdiamant", had 6.6 million streams in its first week and debuted at number 26 in Germany. It was the first time Samra entered the German charts. In July, he reached number one as a featured artist on Bushido's "Für euch alle".

In November 2018, at age 23, Samra had his first solo number one in Germany with "Cataleya" (produced by Bushido). In January 2019, he received the Hiphop.de Best National Newcomer award.

That month, Samra reportedly left Bushido's label. In March, he and Capital Bra reached number one in Germany with "Wir ticken". Samra's EP, Travolta, was released as part of Capital Bra's CB6 premium box set on April 26. The following month, "Wieder Lila" was Samra and Capital Bra's second number-one single in Germany.
