Absolute Misery was created in Belleville, Ontario, Canada late in 2003 as an outlet for utterly slow, low end drone, which did not always fit into DarkDread's other projects (Alone in Silence, Besargian, DoomSquirrel, Dusk Ov Shadows, Funerary Dirge, Goatbomb, Neurasthenia). The idea originally stemmed during some ambient/drone experimentation under the Alone in Silence name. Indeed, the first release--Forever Rotting...--saw its birth under the aformentioned project name.

There aren't really any influences which shape the Absolute Misery sound, which is, itself, comparable to the likes of Sunn O))), Pelican, and other drone doom, albeit, with much more ambient passages thrown in. Perhaps, a more apt comparison, would be a slower, minimalist, version of Until Death Overtakes Me, but without any vocals. Certainly not easily accessible music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Absolute+Misery">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
