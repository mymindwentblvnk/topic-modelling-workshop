Crocell was formed in January 2007 by members and ex-members from Compos 
Mentis, Slugs, Adversary, and Demolition Inc. with the clear intention of 
rising to the upper echelon of the Danish metal scene and despite the short 
lifespan the band has already attracted a lot of attention. Thus 
Danishmetal.dk included Crocell on a list of the most promising Danish bands 
only four months after the first rehearsal session, the band is currently 
nominated in the "Talent of the year" category at the Danish Metal Awards 
2008, and so far all the live reviews have been nothing less than stunning! 
After a tremendously promising beginning, Crocell's debut album is finally 
ready to be unleashed.
