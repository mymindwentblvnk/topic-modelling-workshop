Anadol is a psychedelic synth folk project by GÃ¶zen Atila, a Turkish sound artist and photographer based in Berlin. This project represents her liberation from a rather academic approach to electronic composition which she pursued during her music technology studies in Istanbul. She calls her education the "darkness of serious music" where she first tried to belong, then to break free with the help of lo-fi synth pop. As a producer of radio plays and an expert field recording artist she has developed a distinct sense of timing, editing and sound design. Her Anadol project walks in the footsteps of lone synth experimentalists like Bruce Haack and The Space Lady with their childlike curiosity for electronic sounds, pushing the boundaries of minimal equipment. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Anadol">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
