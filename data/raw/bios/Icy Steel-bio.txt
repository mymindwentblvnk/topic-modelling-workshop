The band borns officially in january 2005 (even if it existed from 3 years) from Stefano. The love for heavy metal imposed him from the beginning a rough sound but not for this less cured, with epic pieces in 80's style.
Stefano had to bring Icy Steels flag high just with the force of his own spirit reducing him to sound with synthetic drums,bass and multitraced guitars before a computer, because in Sardinia, if not for some exceptions, heavy metal scene is getting weaker every year and even with their efforts to find the missing band members, after many attempts there was nothing to do.After this period a friend who sustained their cause informed them that a drummer with metal in his heart, was looking for a band worth of that music. 
So the drummer in quest was ALESSANDRO OGGIANO who as soon as he knew of Stefano, he didn't hesitate in making himself ahead and after some tries he entered officially to take part in ICY STEEL’s initial project, giving to the band the same standing of their ideals and willforce.Tries of other guitarists were imminent but a guitar needs a soul who sounds it and not just someone who applies a bunch of techniques just for themselves.
As in a chain reaction Alessandro contacted a friend of his, guitarist, with a strong passion for heavy metal, ALBERTO ERETTA and it was useless to say that it was immediately a strong mutual understanding and with him at the guitar the band was not just an idea anymore. Only the bassplayer was missed now to create the full line-up… This role has been immediately filled-up by ROBERTO LADINETTI, a great bassplayer and brother with a big experience in this ground. 
Very similar musical influences and ideologies accompanied the band in a coherence so strong that they couldn't find anyone in their same region someone who had their same musical and philosophical ideologies but the band had not a name yet: what else there is so difficult if not a name and a logo for representing band in all of its essence? So there was the need to find the key word, exciting epic and hard at the same time. So stop with unworthy names anymore the less prevedible as they can, stop with who say that heavy metal is a thing of the past and bad. They don't do it for fashion and the only way to shout this to the world was to refer to what the most founded was in heavy metal : ICY STEEL. The band , concert after concert token more confidence respect to the beginning purposing for the most part own-made songs but even covers like `Kings of Metal` , `Heavy Metal Angels` and `Breaking the Law`. 
The results from the public were positive, there were the ones who hosannate them and there were the ones who hated them because their convinction made them think in good or bad something negative to the public. 
Now everyone of them is proud to be part of ICY STEEL and to trust each other because in battle if there is not a strong hand and confidence between warriors there isnt an army that could win.
