Accordions are for Bavarian Humpa Bands? Violins are for a little nice and boring Girls ?

Not when AHEAD TO THE SEA are entering the stage!

This is the new band of the Singer of Across the Border (RIP)!

Riverdance on Speed, with hard Guitars and a great Rhythm-Section, spiced with some cool Dub, the spirit and sound of Punk  and some hot Ska Beats. That is their sound and they call it: Folk Punk. 

Great Lyrics about Unfairness, Fight and Love, Happiness and Pain without beeing a teacher.
The heart is on the left side...!

A Must have for fans of The Pogues or newer bands like Flogging Molly!
