There is more than one band with this name:

1-  Wyvern, a Heavy/Thrash Metal from Egypt was formed in late 2003 by Hameed former bassist of Mastermind and Marwan former guitarist and vocals of Allegiance. The band started as a four piece band, the original line up was Seif El-Din Moussa (Drums & Vocals), Marwan Shaaban (Guitar & Vocals), Hameed Sabry (Bass) and Sherif Alaa' (Guitar). WYVERN started as a cover band, playing songs for Metallica, Megadeth, Iron Maiden, Sepultura and Slayer. The band's first performance was on January 23rd 2004.

WYVERN wrote their first original song entitled Sex For Sale in mid 2004 and was performed in their 4th concert that year. Since then the band started focusing on writing more original songs to switch from a cover band to an original band. The band is mainly influenced by old school heavy metal bands and that reflects heavily on their song writing and compositions.

In 2006, the band decided to add a new member to the line up. Adham Roshdy former singer of Helium joined WYVERN in October 2006 as the lead singer. Adham took over the singing part of all WYVERN original songs. The band performed with the new line up at the SOS Music Festival Volume II that was held at the Chinese Garden at the Cairo International Conference Center in front of 15,000 music fans.

WYVERN opened for Pain Of Salvation in Cairo on April 4th 2007 as part of the Swedish band SCARSICK world tour. Currently WYVERN is writing more songs and preparing to record their debut album. No release date is set for the time being.

In November 2007, Adham parted ways with the band and was replaced by Omar Brazily. Brazily has been known for his unmistakable voice and his accurate high notes. Brazily started his work with WYVERN by leading the band in the SOS Music Festival infront of 20,000 Music Fans.
