The Great Work - Created by Lord Eibon Blackwood around his interest's in Victoriana Occult and Infernal Brigantia - The age of a bygone era and those halcyon days of spiritual discovery - Eibon la Furies encapsulates a love for traditional black metal, classical ambience and the beginnings of photography and film. 

Their first work entitled 'Something Wicked This Way Comes' released on their own 'Ministry for Infernal Affairs' label is available now.

It is a work of dark litanies, industrialised black metal and ambient themes exploring a creativity of the dark side of the human condition. Influences are drawn from extensive reading of the historical and fictional stories of Britannia's dark past, present and future. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Eibon+La+Furies">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
