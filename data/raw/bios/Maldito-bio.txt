Maldito started in mid 2006 with 3 original members which consisted of:
Ace - Vocals
Christian Fiallo - Drums
Andres Torres - Guitar

Later they introduced Bernardo Linares, of The Low Life and later Mehkago N.T. into the band as a fill in bass player to make the band more complete, and several months later Berny started playing guitar and Maldito introduced Juan Ex member of Knock Em Dead to play bass.

The band had several decent shows, and 2 out of town shows. One in Tampa as their second show still playing as a 3 piece and another in Gainesville for "Sick as Fuck Fest"

Maldito recorded a DIY released demo titled "TWO THOUSAND HATE" or "200H8"
