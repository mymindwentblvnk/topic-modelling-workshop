Evolvent's universe deals with a symphonic and doom metal-influenced music thereby allying classical instruments and heavy guitars,together with lyrical and death voices: a dialogue halfway angel and devil. 

Evolvent was founded by Sébastien LATOUR – ex Anthemon member - in 2004. After the composition of the first album, Sébastien longly dedicated himself again to Anthemon, in which he was playing the keyboards

In 2006 the side-project Evolvent came back to life when meeting Yann ZILLIOX, former member and founder of Loki Inferni.

By this time, a long work began around the recording of the album called « Spiritual Confession », which will come to its complete achievement in 2008 with Céline DE KERLIVIOU, soprano – member of Ad Vitam Aeternam – and Alan RAOUL, bass player of Hot Hell Room and ex co-founder of Coldown.. " Ludovic Rouix, ex-drummer of Anthemon and who played in,has just joined Evolvent. He will take part in the next album".  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Evolvent">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
