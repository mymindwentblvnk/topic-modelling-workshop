Bulletsize started the year 2004 in the depths of Sweden. First as a thrash-metal band, but has now evolved to a faster, angrier and heavier combination of oldschool thrash and modern death-metal. Their selftitled CD was released in 2008 and extensive touring soon followed. In 2009 Bulletsize grew from a well established powertrio into a four-piece band. They soon began to write new material and after more touring Bulletsize has now released this 4 track promotional EP "The Apokalypse". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bulletsize">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
