Human Sculpture is a modern death metal band from Finland. They released an EP called 'Our World / Torn Down' in 2011... The type of music they play is in a way reminiscent to bands like Ignominious Incarceration, Nervecell and Chimaira, but Human Sculpture added a nice flavour of  vanilla just for the sake of it.. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Human+Sculpture">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
