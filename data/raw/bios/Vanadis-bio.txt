Vanadis started out as a family project two to three years ago. Lucy and Ruben had combined musical forces many times before, as a piano and vocal duet. However, their mutual passion for heavy metal soon set them on a journey to create their own band in this genre. Soon bassplayer David was found, and songs were written. When guitarist Nathan joined the gang, the real band chemistry started. 
In the following months successful gigs followed, such as the performance at the Archeon Midwinterfair 2006, their maiden voyage. After some time, frictions in the band become more apparent, resulting in the departure of drummer Daniel and second guitarist Bart. After this, the success became even greater when Vanadis joined forces with the drummer Sascha, who also made a huge contribution to the positive feeling within the band, and soon they decided to part ways with the bassplayer David. Recently Vanadis has been recording a new demo, due to be released in march 2009.

The current line-up is:
Lucy - vocals
Ruben - keys and vocals
Nathan Michaels - guitars and narrative voice
Sazj - drums <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vanadis">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
