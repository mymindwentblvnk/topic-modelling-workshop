There is more than one artist with this name:

1. Zoltan is an progressive electronic duo from London drawing from their long-standing interests in vintage sci-fi paperbacks and obscure horror soundtracks. Zoltan bring you menacing chordal sweeps, cinematic synthscapes and relentless, angular rhythms, with ambient interludes, Giorgio-Moroder-from-hell sequencers and bone-shaking crescendos. Banks of vintage synths are underpinned by a driving rhythm section, infusing the intricacy of prog with a repetitive, psychedelic energy. For fans of Goblin and Heldon.
