Lost In Grey was founded in 2013 by composer, vocalist and keyboardist Harri Koskela and lyricist and vocalist Anne Lill Rajala. What originally was planned to be merely a short-term project soon grew into a band. Inspired by a large variety of musical genres, literature and the world itself, Lost in Grey creates multifaceted music and brings elements of drama to their songs as well as live performances. Lost in Grey's 3rd full-length album Under The Surface will be released on July 2nd 2021, via Reaper Entertainment Europe.

Followed by the previous album releases, The Waste Land (2019) and The Grey Realms (2017), both which claimed great responses from audiences and media, this new album takes another giant leap towards even greater musical adventures. The vocalists Emily Leone, Anne Lill Rajala and Harri Koskela play the main characters within the overarching story on the albums, and bring a very own touch to it through their diverse voice talents.

In recent years these theatrical metal pioneers have proven to be one of the most promising and inspiring acts coming from the Finnish metal scene, electrifying their audiences through their versatile musical storytelling and tremendous sound. Now Lost in Grey invites you to dive with them Under the Surface where music and stories dance hand in hand, and everything is possible. Get prepared for a twisted rollercoaster ride through storms and tides - spiced up with some sparkles of stardust.
