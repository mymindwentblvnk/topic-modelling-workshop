An interesting sound here, this Greek band going for a blend of death, thrash, and even a touch of progressive metal, with traditional death metal vocals over the top. There is a fair amount of diversity in the music, so that even with the samey vocals, the songs contain a degree of individuality, and the musicianship is quite solid without being over-indulgent. Random's Manifest is the only album reviewed here -- other reviews suggest that the previous album, Pieces Of Mankind, might be better, if more thrash-based. Nevertheless, Random's Manifest is quite a find and worth a a listen. The band formally announced its breakup in August of 2001, citing the reason as "it is better to burn out than fade away."

Here is a complete press-release/biography of the band:

 They were characterized by many as the most subversive, controversial and “heretical” Death Metal band that took the Greek scene until 2001. Recordings for them began when the word "discography" sounded very new to the Greek underground. Received numerous enthusiastic reviews from world press and a host of opponent arrows especially in their own home country.

ACID DEATH, one of the oldest Greek bands that have been active for 12 years, from 1989 to 2001, started from classic Thrash Metal and ended up being the sole representatives (for many at a European level) of Progressive Death Metal up until their disband. Now they are making their comeback! Having the assets of an EP, a split LP, two full length CDs and countless live appearances at times where live gigs where worth their weight in gold, they played along with bands such as KREATOR, THE HAUNTED, IMPALED NAZARENE, CHILDREN OF BODOM, MAYHEM, ROTTING CHRIST, they have come full cycle and the years that followed only strengthened their name... Their members were found in other bands of the scene, giving good examples. The "Total Recall" of 2011, almost 10 years after their disband, finds them with a revamped lineup, endless inspiration and above all the mood for a lot of hard work. The band has already started work on new material for the new, yet untitled, musical step.

Key Points about ACID DEATH.
-1991. ACID DEATH at their first steps in recording, they perform a independent production of their first mini LP called Balance Of Power, a piece of work that was to remain on the shelf and see the light many years later when the band had dissolved in the form of free downloading.

-1993. The year they released their first official work, the EP HYPERLINK “Apathy Murders Hope” by the Greek independent label MOLON LAVE recs, providing the first evidence of the Progressive Death Metal path that the band was to follow a few years later.

-1995. Two years later, a split-LP is recorded and released with Spanish Extreme Metallers AVULSED. The band have already loses the opportunity of a very good record deal with a famous label of that time due to military services.

-1998. The first full length CD “Pieces Of Mankind” is recorded, showing the Progressive character that is to be followed by the band. ACID DEATH were walking a tightrope between Death Metal and Fusion/Jazz and the first negative arrows began to come... The album, released for first time by the Greek label METAL MAD Music, remains forgotten and scorned to domestic record store shelves, but the re-release of 1999 by the English fledgling label Copro Recs/Casket Music makes it "Album of the Month" in a VERY well-known English magazine site, which is radical and unheard-of for its time...

-2000. The swansong full length CD is released by the already established BLACKLOTUS recs making the name of ACID DEATH affirmed and applauded by the European press and made fun-of in their own country! The provocative cover of the album is censored the CD is removed from the German market... For the first time the foundation of the band start grinding unusually strange...

-2001. After 12 years and 4 official releases, the band announced it’s disband while being in the studio for the pre-production of their third full-length.

-2008. Pieces Of Mankind is to be the first among the "Greek Metal Scene-40 Most Distinctive Album of all Time" as voted by the editors of the Greek RockHard Magazine.

-2009. 18 years after it’s recording, the first -unreleased- mini LP of ACID DEATH sees the light in the form of a free downloading as a "gift" to those who had appreciated the band all the past years.

-“Live After Death"... A case not rare, but with an another application. The name of the band is strengthened and boasted while practically ACID DEATH “are non-existent for over 10 years”.   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Acid+Death">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
