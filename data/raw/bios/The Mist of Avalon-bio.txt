Founded as a classic goth rock band back in the 90s, The Mist Of Avalon have built up quite a reputation during the last 15 years performing together with a. o. Tiamat, Funhouse, NFD and 69 Eyes. Now, after a recording hiatus of 10 years, the Swedish band present with “Dinya” their much-anticipated third album. Regarding their musical development, the band has successfully cast off any genre bonds.

The 12 new songs show an exceedingly varying range of various influences. Of course, some original goth elements can still be found at times as proven by e. g. the dark “Negri” being accompanied by heavy guitars. However, the band knows how to build up permanent tension throughout the whole album with boisterous up-tempo tracks (“Loosing Yourself“) or the epic “Said It All“ and “Waiting Still“.Singer Aram Yildiz’s flexible voice that is capable of mastering both dark, screaming and very melodious parts, is quite impressive.

Supported by subtly applied female background vocals, songs like “I Wish“ grow into energetic indie wave pop hymns which, indeed, show similarities to bands like A-Ha or the Chameleons (“Tell Me“). “Dinya“ offers soulful, driving and fresh indie wave rock with an undertone of a deep and sometimes gloomy melancholy far away from any artificial depression. Hence, the band has succeeded in recording a very entertaining album which stands out by its powerful intensity and great diversity. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Mist+of+Avalon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
