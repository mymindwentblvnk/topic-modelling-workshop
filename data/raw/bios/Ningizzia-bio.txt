The 1997 founded band consists of French Stéphane Peudupin (Inborn Suffering, Abysmal Abhorrentia, Mislead, Fractal Gates, Lethian Dreams) and Swedish Niclas Frohagen (Forest of Shadows, Shubend). The dark doom folk metal music and depression-themed texts are in part worked out between the members over the internet. They release their music over the Haceldama Productions label, of which Stéphane is a collaborator.
