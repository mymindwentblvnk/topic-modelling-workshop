Ydin is a fast, violent, and raw death metal band hailing from Finland. Their words of death and destruction are growled in Finnish language. 

The band was formed in 2003 in Ylivieska, Finland. In the end of the year Ydin put together five songs after active rehearsing and song composing. The songs were recorded in Coffin Studios by their drummer Löytynoja, and the sessions took for a quite long time. Finally in the autumn of 2004 band's first recording Verityöt (Bloodworks) was released. These visions of death received quite a good feedback from the media.

In February 2005 Ydin entered again to Coffin Studios to record a successor for Verityöt. This time the sessions went quite promptly and Silvottuna ja häpäistynä (Mutilated and Dishonoured) was recorded in four days. Soon after the recordings the drummer Löytynoja decided to leave the band. The band wanted to postpone the release of Silvottuna ja häpäistynä until they found a replacing drummer. The search continued for a long time but eventually they found Kuusisalo to step behind the battery.

During 2007 Ydin recorded five more songs once again in the Coffin Studios. The sessions were long and difficult because of lot's of different misfortunes. Their third recording was named Saasta (Scum) and released in March 2008. Media's reaction was even more positive than earlier.

All their releases are available for download with lyrics on band's website.
