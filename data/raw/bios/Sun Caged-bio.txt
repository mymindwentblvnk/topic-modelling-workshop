Sun Caged was formed in the spring of 1999. Operating as a studio project at first, the band members decided to transform Sun Caged into a full-time band when guitarist Marcel Coenen's band Lemur Voice broke up in the summer of 2000.

After some demo releases between 2000 and 2002 the band signed a record deal with Finnish Lion Music for worldwide release of their debut album. Soon after, the band signed a contract with Marquee/Avalon Records for Japan.

The debut album, mixed by progressive rock mastermind Arjen Lucassen (Ayreon/Star One/Stream Of Passion), was recorded in early 2003 and released on October 22 of that year.
 
From late 2001 on, Sun Caged started building up an impressive status within their genre by playing lots of shows, including several remarkably sizeable ones. Interest from bookers and fans of progressive metal grew considerably. This also led to several interviews in prominent magazines and to some shows as a supporting act for bands like Vanden Plas and Queensryche.

Those who try to describe Sun Caged's music will find this a considerable task. Influences range from progressive metal to fusion and jazz, and atmospheric and ambient jaunts. The band's progressive blend is going to excite lots of listeners because of its diversity and excitement.

Sun Caged has also drawn comparison to such artists as Ayreon, Meshuggah, Iron Maiden, Kansas, Styx, Faith No More, Liquid Tension Experiment, Dream Theater, Pain Of Salvation, and Cynic.

The band released their second album, “Artemisia,” in March 2007.
