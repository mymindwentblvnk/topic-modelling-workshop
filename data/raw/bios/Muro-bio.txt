There is more than one artist with this name.

1. Muro is a heavy metal group formed in 1984 in Vallecas, Madrid, Spain. Their debut album, Acero Y Sangre, was recorded live in December 1986, and the album was responsible for introducing the speed metal genre in Spain.

Between "classic" heavy metal and thrash metal, exploring both genres, Muro expanded this style of heavy metal in Spain. Unlike pure thrash metal bands, Muro was more heavy and melancholic, and their musical influences come from from the furious guitar riffs of Judas Priest, Motorhead and Accept, which added to the base passionate vocals stylistically similar to those of Manowar and Baron Rojo. In addition, it is distinguished by the very peculiar form of singing with Silver, his vocalist.
