Storm of Swords are a Thrash Metal band from El Paso, Texas, USA. Founded by bass/vocalist, Jacob Gonzalez, drummer, Sergio Lizalde and lead guitarist, Rhone Mendoza met in 2011. Jacob Gonzalez kept the band going after Rhone Mendoza moved away and Sergio Lizalde & Adrian Torres were fired for professional reasons. The band has undergone through several line-up changes but that hasn't discouraged them in any way and they continue to raise up a storm at every performance. They self-released a demo CD titled "Prelude to War" in 2014 that is available for purchase at their official Bandcamp page.
