We are a heavy metal band from Rugby, Warwickshire. We originally began in late 2006 with original members Pete Jolliffe (lead guitar), Ben Cowperthwaite (Rhythm guitar), Stefan Vassalos (bass/vocals) and Matt X (drums). 
The band was set up as a cure for our boredom, and we started off just playing a few rock/metal covers. 
To get to the line up we have today, we have had to do a fair share of hiring/firing as we are getting a lot more serious. 
We have our first EP coming out this summer, and we will keep you informed of all the "goings-on" whilst making the EP, so watch this space... <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/TESTIMONIUM">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
