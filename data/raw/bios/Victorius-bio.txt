The young Power Metal band Victorius maintain the traditional sound of metal like almost any other young and aspiring band. Since 2004 these five musicians from Wolfen, Germany amaze due to powerful and fast riffing, paired with sophisticated lead-and solo guitar parts and clean vocals not only those who feel united with the roots of metal as they do themselves.
Victorious as of 2014 have released 3 Full Length Albums
Unleash the Titans in 2010
The Awakening in 2012
Dreamchaser in 2014

Victorius is currently featured on Sonic Attack Records.
