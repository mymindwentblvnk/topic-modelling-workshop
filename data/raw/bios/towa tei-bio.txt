Towa Tei (テイ・トウワ) is a Japanese-born DJ, who first earned notice for his production work on the Jungle Brothers' 1989 LP Done by the Forces of Nature.

In 2005, Towa Tei released a new album dubbed Flash and a new single with Kylie Minogue, "Sometime Samurai", which reached number six in Japan.

His best-known work in the West was as part of the post-80's NY house music trio, Deee-Lite.

After the break-up of Deee-Lite in the late 90's, Towa Tei returned to Tokyo to join the burgeoning "Shibuya-kei Scene" with the likes of Pizzicato 5 and Fantastic Plastic Machine.

His 5th. original album is out in Japan and on iTunes internationally. The single "Mind Wall" that featured Miho Hatori has received the Best Dance Music Video Award at MTV Music Video in Japan 2009.

As a DJ, he has been actively playing all over the world.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Towa+Tei">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
