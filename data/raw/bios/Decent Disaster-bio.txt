The five members of Decent Disaster are set to release their debut album called The Empire in early fall 2012.​
Back in 2008, the band was formed with the motivation to play heavy progressive music.​
Ever since, they have played several shows around their home base Switzerland. After two years of focusing on regardfully writing extravagant song material, the first drummer​ had left the band. Once the new guy finally was to be found, the ponderous guitar riffs obtained a little face lift. Their creation of music is filled with energy, virtuoso guitar shredding and fierce vocals. The songs are melodically organized and enriched with a scent of constant aggression. Now the band is eager and pumped to face the world with their first studio record.
