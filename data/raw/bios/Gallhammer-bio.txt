Gallhammer is a black metal/doom/crust punk band, formed in Tokyo, Japan in 2003. The band consists of Vivian Slaughter (bass/vocals) and Risa Reaper (drums/vocals). Mika Penetrator (vocals/guitar) left the band in 2010 before recording of the 3rd release The End.

By 2006, they had released four demos and one full length LP, Gloomy Lights.  Late 2006 they were signed to Peaceville Records.  In January 2007 they released a compilation album, The Dawn of Gallhammer which came with a DVD of early live performances in Tokyo. Their album Ill Innocence was released on Peaceville on September 24th 2007 to some critical acclaim.

Their music is quite slow, depressing, and dirge-like in atmosphere, influenced by 80's bands such as Hellhammer, Celtic Frost, Amebix, and early Burzum.
