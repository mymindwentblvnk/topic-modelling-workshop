Formed in 2006, Korupture has since become a major force in the Alaskan music scene. Having supported artists such as Exodus, 3 Inches of Blood, Darkest Hour, Misery Signals, 36 Crazyfists, Poison the Well and others has fueled the fire which they will use to spread their frostbitten brand of northern metal to as many worlds as possible. 

Their first album, The Book of Time, was released in July 2008, and is available now. Since then, the band has moved in a much more progressive and experimental way, leaving room for many of their diverse influences such as Jazz and fusion to shine through among epic technical metal overtures.

Due to the extreme isolation of Alaska the band relocated to Seattle, Washington in June 2009.

Look for a new EP coming in early 2009!
