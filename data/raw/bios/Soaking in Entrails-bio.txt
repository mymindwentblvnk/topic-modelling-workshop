Soaking In Entrails started in the summer of 2006 when Janneke (Dimaeon, Emanation) and Wimmer (Boal, Anaemia) decided to create some brutal slamming death metal in the vein of bands like Devourment, Internal Bleeding, Soils Of Fate, etc. In just a few weeks there were already some songs ready but the band wasn't complete yet. Guitarist Jelle (Dimaeon, ex-Despondency, Boal, Emanation) was asked to help out with the guitar-tracks and for the drums we decided to use a drum-computer. Only a few months after we started we already recorded our first demo "Perpetual Human Atrocities". The reactions on this demo overwhelmed us and only motivated us to write more and better songs. In the meantime we're in the studio to finish the recordings for our upcoming split cd with Infected Guts, Tamakeri and Sadistic Butchering and after that we'll just see what comes on our way. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Soaking+in+Entrails">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
