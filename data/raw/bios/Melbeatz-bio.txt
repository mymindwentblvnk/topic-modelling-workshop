Melanie Wilhelm a.k.a. Melbeatz is a German hip-hop producer and the long-time girlfriend of celebrated rapper Kool Savas.

Melbeatz produces most of the tracks of the Optik Records Crew (Kool Savas, DJ Nicon, Amar, Caput, etc.) and also makes beats, including one for Ashanti. Melbeatz's debut album, Rapper's Delight, was released in 2004, featuring guest rappers such as Kanye West, Mobb Deep, Ol' Dirty Bastard, Thirstin Howl III, Tha Alkaholiks, Afrob, Autodidakt, Kool Savas and Samy Deluxe. This album produced the hit single "OK" by Kool Savas and Samy Deluxe, an unexpected collabo, as the lyric, "Er und ich ist fuer Deutschland wie Jay and Nas fuer Amerika" ("He and I are for Germany what Jay Z and Nas are for America") attests. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Melbeatz">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
