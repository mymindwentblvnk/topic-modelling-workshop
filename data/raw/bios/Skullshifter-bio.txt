SKULLSHIFTER peels away the surface and digs deep beneath the obvious...slicing through layer upon layer of lies to reveal the truths which exist within...exploring the twisted desires of humanity and confronting the harsh realities of existence in the world in which we all must live.

Focusing on the darkest, most primitive urges which are in constant turmoil within every one of us, SKULLSHIFTER lashes out through bone-crushing, uncompromising metal -- expressing the anger, fear, and frustration we are forced to endure in order to function inside the civilized boundaries of society.

Forged from the same raging fires as Here in Hell, Inner Demons marks a dramatic progression in the evolution of SKULLSHIFTER. Unleashing a menacing crush of sound that is as uncompromising as it is diverse, Inner Demons assaults the senses with punishing rhythms, searing leads and visceral vocals over 9 unrelenting tracks.
