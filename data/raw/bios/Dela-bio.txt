I (Dela) started making music when I was about 10, learning instruments and stuff.. haven't stopped since.. discovered sampling when I was like 14, musically raised by RZA and A Tribe Called Quest's Midnight Marauders.. At this time I was making beats for the local rappers, spending my time doing $10 mic studio sessions, everytime I wasn't at school.. I kept on doing my thing and will continue to.. cause "saddest thing in life is wasted talent", well it might be true.. so keep on doing your thing Y'ALL !!!!!!!!!! 

Formerly of Soul Village. Soul Village was formed in late 2003, when the band was asked to record a few tracks for the Jazz Makossa label, from Cologne, Germany. Two of these tracks have later been released on a 7" (also by Jazzy Sport for all the japanese cats), including an "Everybody Loves The Sunshine" cover and a "We're Gettin Down" one on the B-side. They haven't stopped recording since and y'all should be on the look out for some brand new upcoming tracks from the Village in 2005. But for now, here you can enjoy a few of the "rough" tracks that were recorded late 2003/early 2004, and were not picked by Jazz Makossa for the 7".
