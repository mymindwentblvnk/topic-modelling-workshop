A Kid Hereafter In The Grinding Light is the sideproject of A Kid Hereafter. They play grindcore and it's Frederik Thaae (the frontman of A Kid Hereafter), who had made the music. They released their first album, A Kid Hereafter In The Grinding Light, February 11, 2008.

He started out on the demo, with one pop-track, one reggae-track and two death metal-tracks. Then he made his first album, which was very experimental pop, with influences from rock, reggae, rap and some grindcore, but not so much. He has now released a grindcore record, which has surprised a lot of fans.

The album consist of around thirty songs, and they're around 1 minute in length each. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/A+Kid+Hereafter+In+The+Grinding+Light">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
