Biography:
"Founded in 2005, the musical direction taken by Arkngthand evolved from rough speed metal to a catchy mix of metal / rocksongs with a lot of eye for melody. This in combination with a very fresh and open sound completes the start of an interesting musical journey that will lead you through medieval lands full of kings and their royal households, merchants and bards…

On May 12 2007, Arkngthand released their full-length album “Merlin’s Chamber” which resulted in a successful year of live-shows and an ever expanding fan base. Winning the ambitious band contest “Podiumvrees” and the “Mama’s Pridest Award” for most promising band 2008 alongside titans as Alain Clark (NL), Electric Eel Shock (JPN) and 3 Storeys High (UK), gave birth to the next level of Arkngthand. From that point on they were praised more than ever for their ecstatic live-shows jam-packed with positive energy.

VPRO 3voor12: ”The fun and enthusiasm shines from the stage and this is literally the first time a complete metal band appears on stage with an ear-to-ear smile. That smile works contagious: the whole crowd is filled with happy faces”

"This ever returning reaction from an extremely diverse crowd is the essence of our live shows and confirms that Arkngthand can appeal to any music-lover, regardless of age or genre."
