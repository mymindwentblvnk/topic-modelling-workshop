About
Exterminatus was created in 2012 by XENOCIDE member Tabreez Azad after a hazy night spent discussing "Warhammer 40k" with good friend Chris Casson.

The debut album, "VENI VIDI VICI", is currently being tracked with Andrew Baena of "Galactic Pegasus" with a tentative release in mid-May 2013.

The album deals with the protagonist Warlord Fenris, dispatched by the Emperor 
God-King to obliterate an Ork infested world. All while an ancient stargod watches from nearby.

Ridiculous "did I just hear that?" moments littered throughout, this riff-oriented, groove based album is for fans of Decapitated, Gojira, Devin Townsend, Amon Amarth, Rings of Saturn and Arch Enemy.

With guest vocals and guitar by Mike Greenwood (AngelMaker), Eli Slamang (Tortorex), Paul Ozz (Paul Ozz/Auroch), Josh McHaffie (Dawning of the Inferno), Andrew Baena (Galactic Pegasus) and featuring special guest artist Kevin Madden (GrooveThumper/Beyond the Son) who will be providing a few tracks of his own.

Writing for the second album, tentatively titled "Gaian Destiny", is already underway. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Exterminatus">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
