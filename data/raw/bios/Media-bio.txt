1) MEDIA was initially a three-piece rock band from Rialto, CA that consisted of Bert on guitar, Andrew on drums, and Bryan playing bass. The band spawned out of mutual interest, years of jam sessions, and broken bands. They started out calling themselves BERT, then THE MELONS and then SBC. During this time the group added their fourth member, a good friend of the band, Jordan. Because of Jordan's multi-instrumental talents Bryan was able to pick up the second guitar, allowing for a more varied and creative sound, and Jordan hopped on bass and vocals. The line up was complete and the band finalized their name as MEDIA. They are currently readying their debut album to be released in 2009 on UNICRONS.
