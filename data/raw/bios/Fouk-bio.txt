We just say Fouk.

For Daniel Leseman & Junktion (Hans Peeman), successful producers on their own merits and friends since childhood, a collaboration was inevitable. Their house sound infused with disco and a lot of funk has been proven to be very infectious.

After the infamous Detroit Swindle signed them to their Heist imprint and released the booming Kill Frenzy EP their name was established firmly to a broad and quickly growing audience. The result was requests for DJ sets across Europe, the America’s & Australia with personal highlights including Glastonbury, LoveBox, Concrete Paris, Output New York, Club Space Miami, Claire and De Marktkantine in Amsterdam.

Their first vinyl release as Fouk, on their own Outplay Records was met with great enthusiasm, the brilliant reactions to ‘Stuff Your Dad Liked’ and ‘Cat Lady’ propelled Fouk and Outplay firmly into the scene as the ‘one to watch’. Since then they’ve released EP’s on Room With A View, The House of Disco and Razor-n-Tape and made a string of strong remixes for the likes of Kraak & Smaak, Smoove & Turrell, Groove Armada, The Brand New Heavies, Luke Million, Joey Negro and Mayer Hawthorne.

After releasing ‘Release The Kraken EP’ featuring Thumpasaurus on The House of Disco, ‘Truffles EP’ on Heist Recordings in 2019 and two EP’s on their own Outplay offshoot ’24 Carrot’ they return again on Heist in 2021 with ‘Blue Steel EP’. Continuing to build on the sound they have evolved throughout the years with a new impulse of creativity. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fouk">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
