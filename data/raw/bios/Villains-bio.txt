There is more than one artist with the name 'Villains'.

1. A rock band from Essex, UK.  
2. A metal band from New York.
3. A dance/house band from LA.

1. Built from the ashes of one of Essex’s most established bands, the members of VILLAINS have toured across the UK and Europe, playing major festivals, touring constantly and had videos featured on the main playlist of some of the UK’s and Europe’s top Music channels.

Pushing the aural and visual boundaries and taking influences from across the musical spectrum, VILLAINS are making their mark early on with their brand of rock.

2. Sardonically embodying the spiritual filth of New York City, 'street metal' degenerates Villians play a combination of early black metal with some death/thrash metal influences, with a decidedly hostile crust/D-Beat vibe that really doesn't give a damn about whether you're having a good time. Desecrator, Nightstriker and Witchwhipper are taking a break from the live circuit to record a their third full-length album this year, to be entitled 'Never Abandon the Slut Train'. Their previous albums, 'Drenched in the Poisons' and 'Road to Ruin' and a split 7" with Fingernails out on Nuclear War Now!. They share members with Unearthly Trance, Serpentine Path, Ceremonium and Hemlock (RIP).


3. Villains, Djs, dance/electro house:
Villains are the truth. The RAC remix was a big step in the right direction, but nothing can top Villains' Electro-Banger mix. Shit is out of control.

Don't sleep on this.
