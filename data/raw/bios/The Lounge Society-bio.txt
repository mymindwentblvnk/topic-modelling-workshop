The Lounge Society are a British punk rock band based in the UK. The band consists of four members; Cameron Davey (vocals, bass), Herbie May (guitar), Hani Paskin-Hussain (guitar), and Archie Dewis (drums). Finding fertile ground by embracing their rural upbringing in West Yorkshire’s Pennine towns, and working with label Speedy Wunderground, the teens have struck upon a huge momentum.

In the space of an enthralling debut EP in 2020, captivating singles, riveting live performances and a debut studio album in 2022, they have made it known they’re anything but another face in a bloated post-punk market. Their debut EP, Silk For The Starving, includes their biggest hit, the groove-heavy banger BURN THE HEATHER. The song takes aim at local landowners’ pre-grouse shooting ritual of burning the moor-top heather. It’s a fresh view on a local issue while saying masses on the wider political dialogue, coming as a cutting statement that’s fully original. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Lounge+Society">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
