May 2006/Germany. Violence Unleashed is mainly me; (Felix Schumacher). In May i started to write some songs. In the beginning nothing really serious were planed with that. But in the forward going process i decide to make a whole Album. The songwriting process lasted from May till August and 11tracks were finished for these Album.

But there was just one problem left; I was alone! So i started to search for sessionartists who are interessted to be involved in these recording. The first guy who was confirmed for that was (Thomas Thede) to record the vokills. He is and old friend of mine with whom i played the last years together in the Deathmetal-Band Eradicate.

Than i got contact to (Yanic Bercier) who was the second Artist i can confirm. He will record the drumtracks. Yanic Bercier is also known from the Band Quo Vadis (canada). The quality of the music of these extra skilled Band speaks for itself.

Last but not least another old friend of mine will be involved on a single track of the album. Its (Thomas Tretow). He is also known from the Band Sturm ( R.I.P.). He is involved in the Guitarsoli and the Vokills in one track.

I just want to give a short overview about that whats going on here. And especialy whats the matter of that! These is not a standart Band but we will make sure that there will be just one possible result: An excellent Deathmetal Album!!!

The lineup for these recording is a guarrantee for this.

So keep an eye on it!
