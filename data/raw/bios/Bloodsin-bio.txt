Bloodsin hails from the eastern part of the Netherlands, with ex members of Pernicious, Death Squad, Devious, and Nobassak.

Bloodsin makes a fine brutal sort of Death metal, just like Cannibal Corpse, Sinister and Six Feet Under did in the early 90's.

There's a free download of the songs "Jezus Burns in hell" and "Live in Hengeloooo" @ www.bloodsin.nl
