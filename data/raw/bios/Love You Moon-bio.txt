Love You Moon is Matthew Embree. 
 
Embree has, in the past ten years, established himself as one of his generation’s most prolific, socially outspoken and musically diverse singer/songwriter/musicians. He has contributed to a number of genre defying bands such as RX Bandits ,The Sound of Animals Fighting , Apotheke  and Pebaluna, to name a few.  Embree has developed a strong and impassioned following that thrives on experiencing his genuine, and musically explosive live shows. For Embree, musicianship is paramount. At the root of all his endeavors lies a pureness and honesty that comes through in his lyrics and the style in which he records, which for the most part is always done live. Embree wrote, produced, and played all the instruments on his debut album, Waxwane, save for a few tracks featuring drums by Chris Tsagakis and vocals by Lauren Coleman (both members of Embree’s own homegrown community known as Mash Down Babylon Records). Sense of community is extremely important to Embree who started MDB Records in 2002.  Operated out of a garage lovingly referred to as The Elizabethan in Seal Beach, California, MDB stems from Embree’s simple desire to help fellow musicians and artists in his circle of friends by releasing their music. In 2006, Embree began collaborating with management/label Sargent House, who helped MDB release of one of Embree’s other bands albums. The philosophies of MDB and Sargent House are shared in their communal spirit; always putting the artist first. Love You Moon’s debut album Waxwane was released by Sargent House/MDB Digitally on May 20th 2008 with a physical release that August.
