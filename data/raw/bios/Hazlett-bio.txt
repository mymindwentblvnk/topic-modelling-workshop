Hazlett is the artist from Brisbane, Australia. A self-proclaimed over-thinker and his own therapist, whose music manages to find beauty in the banalities of modern life. With a well-heeled past touring in rhythm sections and ghost writing for other artists, Hazlett has seen more than we know and is armed with a voice of authenticity to sing about it all. From karaoke with Lindsay Lohan and celibacy, to hosting an AA meeting and friends vomiting on him in taxis. 2019 starts a new chapter for Hazlett, following on from the release of his debut EP ‘Honey, Where Is My Home’. The new single ‘Fireworks’ is marked with a different sense of confidence and certainty in his sound, setting the tone for further releases throughout 2019 and paving the way to a full EP later in the year. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hazlett">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
