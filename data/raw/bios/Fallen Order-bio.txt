Hailing from Lower Hutt, New Zealand. Fallen Order play Metal of the heavy kind.

Combining a strong dose of 80's Metal with the influence of a few modern day defenders of the faith, Fallen Order brings their own sound to the table while remaining true to the elements of traditional Heavy Metal.

Although steeped in tradition the unique Fallen Order sound is characterized by powerful baritone vocals, Bulgarian-tinged drum fills, fast fingered bass lines and the harmonized riffs and solos of the twin guitar attack.

Having successfully completed their first North Island tour and with their debut EP 'The Age of Kings' due for release on February 21st 2014, Fallen Order stand together at the forefront of New Zealand Heavy Metal poised to lead the charge into 2014. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fallen+Order">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
