Coffin Dancer in its short life has somehow survived multiple lineup changes and other adversities commonly plaguing bands of its kind. Since its inception the band seems to trip on a stone just as it's catching the next foothold on the climb up to establish itself as a tangible musical unit. However, it is through this adversity that it has found the will, or just sheer stubbornness, to overcome such shortfalls. This band seeks progress, not stagnation.

Dave - Throat, Guitars, assorted noise 
Jacob - Axe, complimentary assorted noise
