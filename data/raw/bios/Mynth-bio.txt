MYNTH is an electronic duo based in Vienna, made up of twins Mario and Giovanna Fartacek. The siblings have shared their lives since before they were born, and it is near impossible to put into words the special connection they have with each other. They have decided to take this connection even further by combining both of their passions for music. The result is MYNTH.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mynth">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
