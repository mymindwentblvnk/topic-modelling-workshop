2010 set the bar impressively high for British music and now the new year has rolled around the level of talent seems to be on the increase. One of the hottest new acts to start attracting the spotlight is Sasha Keable.

At only 17-years-old, Sasha has been tearing up the scene for some time now and has already got a performance at 2009’s Wireless Festival and a full UK tour with chart-toppers N-Dubz and BRIT award-winning Tinie Tempah under her super stylish belt.

Based in the south east of England’s capital city and managed by Disturbing London, her raw talent as both a songwriter and an artist is making it impossible for her to go unnoticed.

There’s a quiet ferocity in her voice that commands attention and flirts with the ethereal ambience of her sound, and her natural ability to move seamlessly through genres makes Sasha edgy and undeniably fresh. Her lyrical prowess also pushes her to stand out as she draws on her own experiences to embody the reality of emotion.

Her influences, like her music, are eclectic. Having grown up on a diet of heavy metal, music was in her blood from a young age and it wasn’t long before her passion drove her to pursue and discover other sounds. She describes her style as a delicious fusion of ‘trip hop, soul and pop’, citing Little Dragon as one of her most indulgent musical fixations, and as a current BRIT School student admits that alumna Adele has been a great source of inspiration along with other prominent female figures in music. 

She is currently in the studio working on her debut EP and the name she’s been carving into the body of the industry is becoming more visible by the day. Sasha Keable has ignited the spark and her flame is growing. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sasha+Keable">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
