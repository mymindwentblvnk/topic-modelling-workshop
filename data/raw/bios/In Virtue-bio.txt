In Virtue was formed in 2004 as the brainchild of composer/lead guitarist/vocalist Trey Xavier and guitarist Greg Horton. After several lineup changes and setbacks, they have at last released the much anticipated Delusions of Grandeur, and even as it goes to press they are the studio for the follow-up Embrace the Horror, due out in 2010. 
In Virtue was formed with the intent of creating the most compelling possible metal, combining elements of death and progressive metal with an overall power metal speed and epic melody. 

The band consists of lead singer Corinne Reif, (The Mor'rigan's Wake) lead guitarist/vocalist Trey Xavier (Protagonist the Third), guitarist Greg Horton, bassist Chach Schindler, and drummer Eli Vogt (Ancient at Birth, Crow, Nullsake, Children of the Damned).
