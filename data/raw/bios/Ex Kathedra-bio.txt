Ex Kathedra is a progressive metal band formed in Oakville, Ontario, Canada in 2006. They wrote most of their material during the later stages of high school and played shows around the GTA on a regular basis.  Once there was enough material, their full-length debut entitled "This is Where" was recorded at Mastermind Studios in Hamilton, Ontario.  Unfortunately, Ex Kathedra broke up due to personal issues in late 2007.

 The band consists of:
Eric Thorfinnson - Guitar, Vocals
Alex Medley - Lead Vocals
Rei Tanaka - Bass, Vocals
Mike Gray - Drums
Alex Athaas - Guitar <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ex+Kathedra">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
