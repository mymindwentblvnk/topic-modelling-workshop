By way of Lagos and London, Halima is a self-produced artist based in NYC. Her music is singular and draws from eclectic inspirations like Lily Allen and Destinyâ€™s Child. As a producer, Halima uniquely blends electronic music with bedroom Pop/R&B to create something both nostalgic and new.

An official artist select for 2019 SXSW, Halima is set to drop her first EP this year. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Halima">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
