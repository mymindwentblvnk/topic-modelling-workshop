Fukkk Offf aka Bastian Heerhorst has been renowned for some time in his hometown for storming live sets in the clubs scattered around Hamburg's red light district. "Die s√ºndige Meile" or "the sinful mile" as it is known has seen its walls shaked and thighs quaked by the throbbing depths of Bastian's big room Fukkk Offf Sound. Many a night you would witness the frustration on the faces of lonely old men as they realized that the brothels were empty. All the girls would no doubt be down at the club shaking their money makers to the sounds of our young hero. These same streets are where the Beatles made their way in the early 60s. John Lennon was once quoted as saying "I might have been born in Liverpool, but I grew up in Hamburg."
