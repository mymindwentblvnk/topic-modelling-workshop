Houston TX based abstract, intricate blackened death metal with roots deriving from early melodic black metal beginnings and changing directions entirely shortly thereafter. Commonly tagged as "abstract, technical death metal"and referred to by some as the U.S. answer to Canadian death metal band Gorguts, Crimson Massacre keeps evolving with each release and with seperation/inclusion of rotating band members. Luster of Pandemonium saw Crimson Massacre at the threshhold of entering new territory for the band, both melodically and structurally. The untitled follow up full length sees Crimson Massacre exploring wider stylistic possibilities and evolving further with compositional approach into a more varied, unique entity entirely. Upcoming album pending, with no release to date announce yet.
