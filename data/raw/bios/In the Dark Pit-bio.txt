In the Dark Pit is a Polish Experimental Death Metal band formed in 1989. After only releasing a self-titled demo in 1992, the group disbanded in 1996.

In recent years, some of the band members have come together, putting the demo recordings up on the website and newly recording and putting up old songs that never made it to tape. They hope to put together a release of some kind in the future, likely a compilation of material. The band's exact status remains tentative. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/In+The+Dark+Pit">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
