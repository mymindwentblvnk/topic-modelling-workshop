Record Club is a project initiated by Beck in June 2009.  It is an informal meeting of various people to record an album in a day.  An album is chosen to be reinterpreted and used as a framework.  Nothing is rehearsed or arranged ahead of time.  A track is uploaded once a week on www.beck.com as well as through the websites of those involved with the project.  Other featured artists include Nigel Godrich, Joey Waronker, Brian Lebarton, Bram Inscore, Yo, Giovanni Ribisi, Chris Holmes and Þórunn Antonía Magnúsdottir.
