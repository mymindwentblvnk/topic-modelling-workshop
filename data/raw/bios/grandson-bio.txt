Grandson is an alternative artist hailing from Toronto, Canada. Born in the small town of Englewood New Jersey, he relocated to the cultural melting pot of Toronto at a young age, and grew up surrounded by music ranging from jazz to rock and roll to rap, dancehall and r&b. He began playing guitar and piano in high school.

At 17, he relocated to Montreal, QC to attend university, and began working in nightclubs cleaning tables and DJing. He started writing music at this time, incorporating the unique blend of sounds he grew up surrounded by. He started experimenting with music production and rapping in 2013, and dropped out of school to relocate to Los Angeles and pursue music full time.

Adopting the Grandson moniker while living in LA, he dove deeply into rock influences such as Rage Against the Machine, Nirvana, and Led Zeppelin, while also listening to rap/R&B music emerging out of Toronto and alternative acts such as Twenty One Pilots and Hiatus Kaiyote. He found a small community of musicians to work and perform with here in Los Angeles. The live tries to create a frantic, mosh pit-inducing cathartic release of energy for concert-goers, influenced by early punk and grunge music.

Searching for his voice and for meaning in todayâ€™s divisive, chaotic world, Grandson confronts the most pressing issues of his generation through his songwriting, such as financial inequality, governmental and environmental accountability, and social justice, giving these topics a soundtrack with a genuine sense of urgency and frustration. The music also touches on adolescence, relationships, and the insecurities and difficulties of growing up through your 20s. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Grandson">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
