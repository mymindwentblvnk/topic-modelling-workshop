Profile:
Out of the arses of many a good Dunedin (New Zealand) band comes the behemoth that is Christpuncher. With a distinctive sound, a strong christian message and rank aroma, this beast of a band is destined to be the Next Big Thing. Once they have broken out of their own prisons and worked out what this life's for, they will take you higher, to a place where blind men see.
