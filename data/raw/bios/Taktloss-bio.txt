The undefeated german king of Battlerap from Berlin. 
The self-proclaimed "last tight nigger".

Every other German rappers claiming to be word acrobats appear as dyslexia patients when compared to Taktloss. Taktloss's lyrics contain no fillers, every connection makes sense in a twisted way, and even where it makes absolutely no sense, then it's on purpose. The richness of images is amazing, he touches vocabulary which no other German rappers would come up with, vocabulary from the lowest as well as the highest levels of German language. Only Taktloss's fixation on battle rhymes and highly explicit vocabulary holds him back from getting recognition as a highly intelligent MC - most fans of "intelligent" rap from Hamburg or Stuttgart just wrinkle their noses when confronted with his semi-brutal arsenal. But probably it's a self-defense strategy from a guy who is maybe the most mysterious person on the German rap scene.
