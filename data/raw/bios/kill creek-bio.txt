Kill Creek has been a fixture and major influence on the Lawrence, Kansas and Kansas City music scene for as long as most of their recent contemporaries can remember.  They started in 1986 as Shup Bish, but quickly changed their name to Kill Creek.  They released their first album, St. Valentine's Garage (1994), and Proving Winter Cruel (1996), both on Mammoth records.  They released Colors of Home (2001) on Second Nature records.  Along the way they've released countless promotional singles, EP's, and at least two compilation LP's. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kill+Creek">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
