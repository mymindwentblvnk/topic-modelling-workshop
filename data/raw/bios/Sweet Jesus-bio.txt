There is more than 1 band named Sweet Jesus.

1. Sweet Jesus was a promising Shoegazer band, strongly influenced by latter-day My Bloody Valentine, but with a distinctive pop sensibility all its own.  They released a 45 and three EPs in the early '90s, filled with accomplished music which was well received by those fans of the style who discovered them but went entirely unnoticed otherwise.
