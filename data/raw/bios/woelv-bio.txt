Geneviève Castrée Elverum (1981 – 9 July 2016) was a Canadian comics artist, illustrator, and musician from Quebec. She once recorded under the name Woelv and later switched to Ô Paon.

She was born in Loretteville, Quebec and later lived in the Pacific Northwestern United States. She was married to musician Phil Elverum, the leader of the indie rock groups The Microphones and Mount Eerie.

She was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2015, shortly after the birth of her and Elverum's only child. In June 2016, a GoFundMe account was set up by Elverum to assist with their finances.

Castrée died on July 9, 2016.
