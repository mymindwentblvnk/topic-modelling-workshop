4. A Belgian choir, led by Marc Michaël de Smet, mostly specialized in classical music of the 20th century like Alfred Schnittke and Arvo Pärt. 
The chamber choir, consisting of 24 musicians, embraces this age and participates in this exciting, confusing and gaudy shift, where old and new, classical en popular, sacred and secular, progressive and conservative are combined.
Founded in 1995 under the name of Goeyvaerts Consort, this ensemble has expanded, and using a new name, its vision is to embrace all forms of contemporary music in a global musical offering that rises above all categories and specialities.
