Three piece Metal band from Melbourne Australia. In 1999 they released their EP "Finally" in 2001. They have toured with Stone Sour, Machine Head, Mayhem and Destruction. Performed at Metal for the Brain and have appeared on JTV and Triple J's Full Metal Racket.

Their debut album "The Meaning Unseen", released in 2005, was mixed by the famed and respected Fredrik Nordstrom in Sweden.

Their melodic death metal style is a mix of the US and Gothenburg sounds with some clean vocals and both chugging riffs and the melodic riffs with good hooks.

An interesting addition to the album was a taiko drum instrumental by Andrew Haug called Todoroki. This Asian drum style is a passion of his.

Identical twin brothers Paul Haug (Guitars and vocals) and Andrew Haug (Drums and Taiko) along with Tim Stahlmann (Bass, Vocals) form this 3 piece lineup.

Andrew Haug is well known for hosting Triple J's Full Metal Racket program and has appeared in JTV on a number of occasions. 

JTV brought Contrive in on one episode and they were able to play a song and talk about the band. The Haugs also talked about being twins and attempted to pull off swapping instruments, to little success. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Contrive">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
