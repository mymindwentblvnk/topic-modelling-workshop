Too metal for the indie scene and too indie for the metal scene, Broken Ohms have been busy over the past two years creating a sound that is truly their own. A unique blend of stoner/prog/metal/pop/heavy rock can be heard rumbling out of venues across the East Coast that welcome the Ohms onto their stage. With the recent release of their new album "Nocturnal Emissions", these Halifax rockers are currently charting(radio) across the country and getting rave reviews from all over.

"A cursory listen to Halifax, Nova Scotia quartet Broken Ohms, whose name has to be one of the cleverest to emerge from indie rock in a long time, reveals a band that is much too confident in their own ideas to even consider conforming to a preset formula." - HARDTIMES.CA (Montreal)

"...this is incredibly fun, raw-energy rock." - Altsounds.com (UK)

"Broken Ohms are here to rock without regret and sound as good as they possibly can while doing it." - ABORT MAGAZINE (Vancouver)

"...solid constructions with monstrous grooving riffs and catchy choruses." - Chronicles Of Chaos (South Africa)
