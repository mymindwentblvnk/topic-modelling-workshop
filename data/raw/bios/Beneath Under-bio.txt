Band was founded in 2005 by the leadsinger and bassplayer O-P and guitarist Jani. They invited their friends Topi and Niko to join, which they did and have been in the band ever since.Then Tatu (guitarist) joined. Not long after Jani left the band (he was very busy business tonttu). They also invited their other guitarist Otto at that time. Guitarist Tatu was kicked soon after, for several reasons. At that time the band got its name Beneath Under, which the keyboardist invented in the summer 2006. Later guitarist Janne joined the band. It was with this form, the band performed it’s first gig in autumn 2006. Soon after Otto left the band and Janne’s friend Tomi joined the band. It was with this form that band got air under it..s wings for the first time, and it included lots of gigs and new material like Fear, Eternally cursed souls and Never up but always down. The band got bit more popularity when they achieved a place in the final of the Simerocks "battle of the bands". In the summer 2007 guitarists Janne and Tomi decided to leave the band (musical disagreement?). After that, O-P invited their old guitarist Jani and a new talent Arttu to the band. It was with this form when the band released their first Demo in 2008, including songs Light Fails, Blinfold End and Pale. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Beneath+Under">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
