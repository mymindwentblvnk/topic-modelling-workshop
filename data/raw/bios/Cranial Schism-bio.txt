Cranial Schism is the Death Metal band from Pamulang, Tangerang, Indonesia. You can called us CS. We was born on may 2009 to slam and blast with this brutality project. This brutality project formed by Hendri Septriadi (Guttural / Growl), Putro Tangkilisan (Guitarist), Yudha Leonardi (Bassist), and Abraham Simatupang (Blast Beat / Battery). We Influenced by Necrophagist, Dying Fetus, Misery Index, Pathology, and Nile. We mixed our influence's music character with guttural vocal, shred, and blast from us. We mixed all of that with themes about God and religion.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cranial+Schism">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
