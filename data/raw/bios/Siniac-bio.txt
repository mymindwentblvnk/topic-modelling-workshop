"Siniac" (Cyrillic: Сињак) is an archaic Macedonian word from the western part of the land and is still in use in those dialects. It represents an atmospheric appearance - when the water drops on the cold ground are freezing into crystals in the gloomiest and mistiest dawns of the winter.
Siniac is the first symphonic black metal band from Мacedonia. The band has released two full-length album, first "Figment of imagination" in 2002 and the second "Timeless Gatherings" in 2003. The band's status is unknown.
Siniac was formed back in 1999. by Svedo, Tome, Sergej and Nikola, in the city of Skopje (Macedonia). They have played in many bands and decided to form new band.. soon their music began to take a form of black metal. After many live shows, band decided to record a demo CD, which will feature two studio songs and one live. Talking about their music, it could be described as dark/black metal, but with death/thrash guitars, mystical keyboards (not overproduced like COF, Dimmu Borgir, etc), progressive drumming (drummer is great!)...You will not hear so much blast beats here... Solo guitarist plays very unusual but good, creating very dark atmosphere. Clean guitar parts can be found in first song "Figment of Imagination", which makes a perfect combination with sick and dark solo guitar. There is actually no solo or rhythm guitar(ist)... in one moment one is solo, other one is rhythm, and other way around... Vocalist, Daniel, can scream like old-school bands, and do a bit growling like dark/black metal bands. Together with May Result, Interfector, Stone To Flesh, Deaf Auditiorium... Siniac is one of the best black metal bands in ex-Yugoslavia!
The band won on the international contest for underground bands "Loser Fest" in 2001.
