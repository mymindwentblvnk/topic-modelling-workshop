Jane Doe 69 was an alternative metal band from Turenki (Finland) having influence from bands such as Pantera, Fear Factory, Machine Head and Sepultura (Chaos.../Roots... -era). The band was active from late-90's to the start of millennium. After splitting up the five members went on to form three bands: Lockfist, Pain Confessor and SinKing.

Lockfist did one never-released-EP in 2002 and disappeared, but both SinKing and Pain Confessor have recorded several albums to major labels.
