American duo The Vacant Lots release their debut album ‘Departure’ via Sonic Cathedral on June 30, 2014 (UK/EU) and July 1, 2014 (US). It will be available on limited-edition half-black, half-white vinyl, CD and as a digital download. ‘Departure’ was mixed and mastered by former Spacemen 3 legend Sonic Boom and follows previous single releases on Mexican Summer and The Reverberation Appreciation Society, plus an appearance on our very own ‘Psych For Sore Eyes’ EP, now recognised as a landmark release in the burgeoning new psychedelic movement. 

The key element of The Vacant Lots’ minimalist, primitive rock’n’roll songs is their boundless energy, which tears up the psychedelic rock template with a genuine punk spirit. Combine that with the use of synths and drum machines, and it’s not surprising to see why the band have won over Suicide’s Alan Vega, with whom they will be working very soon. Another famous friend is former Galaxie 500 and Luna frontman (and now Sonic Cathedral label mate) Dean Wareham, who plays guitar on ‘Tomorrow’. 

The Vacant Lots recently supported Dean on his US East Coast dates and they will be heading to the UK as guests of The Brian Jonestown Massacre in June and July this year, before further European dates and festival appearances in September. - Sonic Cathedral <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Vacant+Lots">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
