Nu Fuel - modern thrash band from Kharkov, Ukraine. Starting from 2004 when they were playing nu metal and rapcore, nowadays the guys turned back to their true metal roots. Nu Fuel is a combination of Pantera style groove, evilness of Lamb of God and Chimaira's complicated song structure. 

Today it is the most hatred band among ukrainian so called "alternative music" community. Their refusal from nu metal and mallcore shit, and other musical hypocrisy, interest to satanism, heavy alcoholism made them almost always hatred by fans of ukrainian nu metal bands.

The band has a rich concert experience, playing with bands like Amatory, #####, Hostile Breed, Britva Okkama, Tracktor Bowling, Neversmile, Liniya and so on.

In spring 2009 the band will release their debut EP.
