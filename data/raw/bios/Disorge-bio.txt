They speak of themselves as the future of metal, if that is true remains yet to be seen.
But the Umea/Sweden based group Disorge has with their aggressive sound and borderline out of control stage appearance successfully mixed their metal/hardcore sound all for over four years, both on various self produced recordings and on stage supporting bands like Meshuggah, Therion, Dark Tranquility and Refused. Before and during these years the members of Disorge have also been playing in other Sweden based acts such as Nocturnal Rites, Throne Of Ahaz, Naglfar, Amsvartner and Ancient Wisdom.
With their latest studio recording "Demo 98" in their back Disorge are now ready to embark on yet another journey, this time the Internet. All that's important from the world of Disorge including exclusive pictures, news and mp3 samples will be gathered on this site.
The future belongs to Disorge....And the future is here..... <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Disorge">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
