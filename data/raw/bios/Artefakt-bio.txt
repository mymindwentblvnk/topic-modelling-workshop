Artefakt is a collaboration between Dutch producers Robin Koek and Nick Lapien that share a love for melancholic, hypnotic voodoo music.

Joining their perspectives in a meticulous, hands-on working method, the two bring a balanced and hypnotizing sound to the club. Be it in the form of a dj set or their full- fledged hardware live set crystallizing in the mind and oscillating the body. What sets Artefakt apart is combination of musical material, atmosphere and groove, captivating your spirit, whether you are listening quietly on headphones, or you hear the music pounding from a 10 foot tall PA at a rave.

Artefakt adopts techno as an artform rather than a musical genre. Combining high art and underground culture stemming from the uncompromising squatting scene whilst practicing musique concrete tape improvisations in galeries and musea. This merging of worlds manifests in a versatile nature that is audible in the narrative selection of tracks and dj-sets.

They first introduced their textured, layered and atmospheric sound with 'Mirror Societyâ€™ back in 2012 on Field Records. Further establishing their trademark sound on like-minded labels like Tikita, Prologue and Deep Sound Channel. After releasing 2 full EP's on the legendary Dutch imprint Delsin Records, the duo presented their debut album 'Kinship' showcasing the complete spectrum of their aesthetics. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Artefakt">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
