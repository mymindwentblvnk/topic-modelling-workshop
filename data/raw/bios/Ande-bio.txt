Ande is a Belgian one man black metal project that started in early 2015. It’s a personal
way to honour black metal that was, is and will be. The first album “Licht” was released
at the very end of 2015.

In 2016 a new track “Zoer” was published through the “Merchants Of Air Year 2”
compilation. The second album “Het Gebeente” was released in early 2017 on CD and digital format, a tape edition was issued by the UK Blackwood Productions label a few months later.

“Ande” is an old Dutch word which stands for intense emotions like repent, passion and anger. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/ANDE">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
