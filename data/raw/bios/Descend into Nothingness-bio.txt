The concept of Descend Into Nothingness was created by Joël St-Amant during the year 1998. The principle idea of the band is to make music that is very intense and melodic, with a touch of unpredictability and a constant progression of rhythms that change during each song, creating many dynamic variations. 

In the Fall of 2002 the line up consisted of : Joël St-Amant (Guitar, Vocals), Hugo Lacroix (Guitar), Simon Charette (Guitar), Sébastien Audet (Bass) and Éric Delarosbil (Drums). In November 2002, Éric Delarosbil left the band and was replaced by François Turgeon. This line-up change gave the band a boost of motivation and they started to work harder for the preparation of an album. March 2003 the band entered the studio with Yannick St-Amand (Despised Icon, Ion Dissonance, Neuraxis...) to record its first album Darkened Reality. 

In May 2003, the Abitibian(Quebec) quintet signed with Galy Records. Their album release is slated to be held September 2nd 2003. Now the band is more determined than ever to get on stage and give the most intense performance possible and is already working on their next album.
