There are (at least) two known bands under the name 'Carne'. 
1) two-piece band from Lyon, France, created in 2008, playing a noisy blend of sludge characterized by its loud mid tempo riffage backed with savagely pounding drums.
They collaborated with Marion Leclerq (Mütterlein / Overmars) on both albums Ville Morgue (2013) and Modern Rituals (2016).
Carne sings about everyday life, obsessions, boredom, cities, alternatives and procrastination…
