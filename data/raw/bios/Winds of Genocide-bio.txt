Winds of Genocide is a Durham, UK band that calls their fusion of death metal and crust punk "Apocalyptic Death Crust". They were founded in 2006 by vocalist Kat Shevil (Morstice, Blessed Realm, Revolt) and guitarist Glenn, although it wasn't until 2009 that the band's current lineup solidified, with Dan on bass and Linus on drums (originally bass). They released their first EP, The Arrival Of Apokalyptic Armageddon, in 2010. Winds of Genocide received attention recently when Fenriz, of the Norwegian black metal band Darkthrone, blogged about them on his MySpace page and urged his fans to support the band.

Kat is noteworthy for having a "Kat's Band Of The Week" feature on the Terrorizer website, as well as for being a transsexual woman. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Winds+of+Genocide">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
