Five piece Black Metal/Death Metal outfit from Cambridgeshire, UK. 
They formed in 2008 as a sideproject (members being involved in the other local bands 'This Mantra' & 'Matter Of Distance', which both later disbanded)
Taking huge influence from death & black metal new and old, hardcore, grindcore & most other metal influenced styles, Immorality have caused a stir within the East and South Midlands, playing numerous shows with bands such as, Trigger the Bloodshed, Suffocation, All Shall Perish & Annotations of an Autopsy, and are also spreading further a field and creating a study fanbase within the Manchester scene.
A change of line-up with the departure of guitarist Lee Miller caused a small hiatus, but within weeks were back on track with the addition of Joel Mason ('Exertion' & ex 'Taken from Everyday')
Immorality are currently writing new material & are due to record very soon & are going on tour with 'Tides of Virtue' in July.
