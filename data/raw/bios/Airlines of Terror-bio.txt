AIRLINES OF TERROR: Death/Grind with rocking parts!
Formed by guitarist/vocalist Demian Cristiani shortly after he left NOVEMBRE, AIRLINES OF TERROR was initially an experimental grind band. After some line-up changes, the addition of drummer Giuseppe Orlando of NOVEMBRE, and bassist Paolo Rossi of FLESHGOD APOCALYPSE gave the band direction, and the three soon felt the urge to return to their metal roots, though without sacrificing the frenetic energy they generated on stage. They decided that their own brand of extreme metal would be different, even on the lyrical front… “We wanted our sound to be fresh and unexpected,” explains Cristiani. “A little ‘classy’, a little bluesy, even! And we didn’t want to write lyrics about evil, which has become so clichéd over the years: we wanted to inject a dose of surrealism and irony into our writing…we have tried to depict everyday life in a pulp, absurd way, like a Tarantino movie!” The band released so far 2 demos, one split 7" (thanx to the diy cosnpiracy) and one full lengh on british label rising records.
