Plague Bringer is a duo from Chicago whose music is an assault of programmed bulldozer blast beats, de-tuned stabbing guitars and savage animalistic vocals, yielding a relentless blend of spastic electronic carnage. Their concoction of grindcore and death metal is uncompromisingly brutal yet as groovy as a pop song.
