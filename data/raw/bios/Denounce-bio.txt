Formed in 2004, Denounce have spent the best part of the last decade as one of UK's best kept death metal secrets. Now, with an album in shops nationwide and numerous tours under their belt, they're looking to spread their own brand of riff-laden, energy-driven mayhem further with the writing of their second full-length album.
