One-man band Sam Duckworth, from Southend, Essex, UK, writes socially-motivated acoustic songs, set to a background of scatty electronic beats running from his laptop; what you might call "folktronica". Influences include Roni Size, Athlete, Gomez, Elbow, The Streets and Rival Schools.

Having released one EP and two splits (one CD, one 10") through Big Scary Monsters, Sam signed to Atlantic records in March 2006.

Since then he has released two albums. The first is titled "The Chronicals of a Bohemian Teenager" and the second released in 2008 called "Searching for the hows and whys" <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Get+Cape.+Wear+Cape.+Fly">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
