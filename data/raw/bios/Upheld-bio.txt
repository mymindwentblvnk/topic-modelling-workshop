Since the formation of the band in mid-2004, Upheld has built up a solid, dedicated fan base by playing numerous local and out of town shows. After the completion of a 6 song EP in mid 2005, and several line-up changes, the band is taking the new songs in a more focused direction, blending upbeat drumming with intricate guitar work, solid bass-lines and heavy breaks, all covered with a ferocious scream. The live arena is where the band shines, feeding off the crowd's energy and involvement, often outnumbered onstage by enthusiastic fans.

2006 is looking to be an exciting year for Upheld, with the promise of a split release with Gisborne band Saving Grace, followed up by a full length studio effort later in the year. Opportunities to open for international acts such as The Valley (AUS) and Comeback Kid (CAN) have been welcomed gratefully. Be sure to catch Upheld live in your town in 2006.
