Sir Lord Baltimore was a short lived 1970s American rock band, from Brooklyn, NY. They released two albums on Mercury Records at the start of the seventies. A review of their first record, Kingdom Come, contained the first documented use of the term "heavy metal" to refer to a style of music.  Both of their albums have since been re-released on a single compact disc.

It is rumored that the band broke up after discovering that their contract had cut them out of all royalties from their first two albums.

John Garner and Louis Dambra recently recorded and self-released a new Sir Lord Baltimore album, based on the material that would have comprised the group's third album in 1973. Sir Lord Baltimore III RAW was released in July, 2006.
