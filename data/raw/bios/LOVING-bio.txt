Loving are an indie folk/pop collaboration of David Parry and brothers, Jesse and Lucas Henderson from British Columbia, Canada. The band came together several years ago as a result of their shared summers planting trees in the capitalist ruins of western Canada's forests. Unquestionably, this organic chemistry contributed to Lovingâ€™s lo-fi wonderment of a relaxed and airy warm pop of yesteryear; like looking through the lens of a super eight film from the seventies. Its vibe is similar to golden sunbeams on a summer beach day. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/LOVING">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
