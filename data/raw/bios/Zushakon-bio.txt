Zushakon is a Singaporean band formed in 2006 by Armaros on Guitars and bass, Djinn on Vocals and Radovan "Kunt Hammer" Draza on drums. They set out to record a blasphemous record that embodied their anti-religious beliefs and this came in the form of Chaosophist released in 2007. Sadly afterwards Kunt Hammer left the band after the recording and since then the band has gone through a series of different drummers.

In 2009, Zushakon released a compilation with songs from "Chaosophist" and new songs from a split album "World Ablaze" , it has received high praise and the band is grateful for the support from their fans , not only from the eastern world but worldwide.

In early 2011, Armaros parted ways from the band. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Zushakon">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
