DOWNLOAD FREE 7" ON BANDCAMP

RACES (formerly known as Black Jesus) formed in the fall of 2009 after singer/songwriter Wade Ryff escaped the sweaty grips of multiple bands, the San Fernando Valley and a real life witch. First formed as an impromptu group assembled for a one-off performance, the band was a haphazard collection of musicians who had befriended one-another over years of playing music. The band of seven is on the verge of releasing their self-recorded and produced album. Pick up their debut release – a 7 inch single of “Big Broom” b/w “Cruel and Rude” out late April 2011 on JAXART Records <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/RACES">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
