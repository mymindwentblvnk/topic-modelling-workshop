Brutal death metal from Canada with drum programming. 
At the beginning, the two of us were playing in a band called Erum Furor. In 2001 when the band splitted due to some members moving away, we discussed about forming a project about mass killers.
This first release of 2003 came out to represent the shocking events that happened in the United States of America on septembre 11th 2001. In January 2002, we were both drunk and really pissed off hearing about WTC reported by every kind of media. The project had come out: Our music is timeless compared to the stiffed and quick coverage from the information agencies. So we wrote a song called Falling Towers that night. We have been investing our time in recording a cd called Unexpected Plan in Hate's appartment during summer 2003. Two years after the tragic events, we released the demo on 11/09/2003.


We came out with a new disc in 2007, this time to explore the sickest behaviors of mankind. Nothing could have stopped us from evicting our nastiness. The expression of our work came out from our daily state: A mixture of warm blood with social toxins dilluted. Our goal was to say out loud what most people do not even dare to think. We gave a meaning to all those attrocities in the world, reminding us the insecurity of our world.
