Anagnorisis is a black/death metal band from Louisville, Kentucky. They have released two demos, two full-length albums, and two EPs.

Anagnorisis was formed in 2003 by Austin Lunn as a solo project, adding bassist Zachary Kerr, drummer Adam Pierce, and guitarist Zak Denham before releasing the Overton Trees Sampler in 2005. The band signed to Shiven Records in 2007, whereupon they released their first full-length, Overton Trees, in November of the same year. Lunn exited the band in 2008, leaving to form Panopticon, and the band added vocalist Nathan Bowling to the line-up. After several tours in 2008 and 2009, Bowling and drummer Adam Pierce both left the band. The band also released Alpha & Omega, a three song EP, in early 2009, with Bowling handling vocal duties.

In 2012 it was announced that the band had gained two new members: drummer Chris Smith and bassist Josh Mumford. The group released the two-song tribute EP Ghosts of Our Fathers, featuring then-bassist Zachary Kerr on vocals, along with guest vocalist Julian Kersey of the band Rose Funeral. After a brief tour with Abigail Williams the band began writing and recording Beyond All Light. The album continued the theme of being recorded by the band themselves (led by guitarist Zak Denham), with the addition of the mixing being performed by Denham on Beyond All Light. The group released the album in July 2013 to much acclaim from fans and critics alike. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Anagnorisis">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
