Act of Gods started in September 2001, when Phil [Guitars, former bass player of the French legendary Death Metal Bands Mutilated and Abyssals] decided it was time to strike back stronger than ever. A drummer was immediately found in the person of Guillaume, ex-Mutilated too. Then Ventylator [vocals] joined the band. Act Of Gods was formed with the intent of creating fast, furious and brutal Death Metal.

The year after, in March (2002), the band entered the LB LAB studio, chosen for its' professionalism and for the quality of its productions. This resulted in the recording of the first demo CD "Dies Irae". Loaded with intense drumming, deranged guitar riffs and a killer production, this demo CD stands as one of the most impressive debut releases. The band sent on their own promotional copies to major record labels, which ended in a three-album deal with OSMOSE PRODUCTIONS. The band got mostly positive reviews from magazines, webzines and fanzines worldwide. In October, guitar player Doster Isk joined the band to allow Act of Gods to bring brutality forward and to ensure killer live performances.

Act of Gods have released two more albums since and are currently writing new material for the upcoming album to be recorded later this year, still in the LB LAB studio.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Act+of+Gods">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
