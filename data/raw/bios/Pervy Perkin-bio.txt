Pervy Perkin are a progressive metal band from Murcia, Spain. 
Thee band started out as a project between Alvaro (guitar) and Carly (drums) called Hybrid Blood, which was complete with the inclusion of Dante as a new guitar player along with Alvaro. Rafa ‘Fika’ then joined his bass to the cause and at the same time an old friend of the band, Ugo Fellone, took up the spot of the much needed keyboard player. The name ‘Pervy Perkin’ is stablished in 2011, the same year in which they would compete in an important music contest in Murcia, their homeland, reaching the semi-finals and being the youngest band to do so.

Halfway through 2012, Pervy Perkin focused their efforts on the composition and recording of their debut album, coinciding with the departure of Rafa and the entrance of the magnificent Alex Macho, who would become the lead vocalist from that point on and would record the main vocals for the album.

In October 2013, Pablo ‘Aks’, joins Pervy Perkin as the permanent bassist the band had been looking for since 2012. Shortly after, Ugo Fellone decides to leave the band for personal reasons.

Since mid-2013, Pervy Perkin has set foot in many well known venues of Madrid, such as Sala Caracol, Sala We Rock or Sala Honky Tonk, alongside local and national bands and to a very well met response from critics and the public.

After almost two years of hard work, INK dropped on 3rd of March to critical acclaim. A double LP with over two hours of music with a mixture of styles, passages and melodies Pervy Perkin style.
