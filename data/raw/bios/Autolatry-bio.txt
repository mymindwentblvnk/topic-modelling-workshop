Steeped in their home region New England's rich heritage, Autolatry meld progressive and melodic elements into a whirlwind of sonic character that can only be described as "New England Black Metal". Formed in 2010 out of Mansfield Center, Connecticut as a 3-piece band by brothers Dave and Matt Kaminsky and Karl Chamberlain, Autolatry has since matured into a well-rounded quintet. The band self-released their 2012 EP "Of The Land" to rave reviews, drawing diverse comparisons to the likes of Krallice, Woods of Ypres, and Absu. In addition to recording the follow-up to "Of The Land", Autolatry embarks on a 40+ date US tour between July and August 2012. Expect big things from these New Englanders in the very near future! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Autolatry">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
