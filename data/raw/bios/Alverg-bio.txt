Alverg is a black metal band from Norway.

LÃ³ge created the first music of what would become Alverg around the winter of 2002.

By the summer of 2003 the music had formed into an idea and a concept. A four track demo was recorded, thanks to Dezartog taking care of drums, and Broder Magnus putting on some piano.

The demo generated some interest from a few labels, but due to a collection of unfortunate circumstances a full album was never released.

Alverg was silent for many years.

In the closing of 2007, Heolstor joined and made possible for the first time to work dedicated and focused on making Alverg spread its wings.

The debut album entitled Elde was released in April 2009.
