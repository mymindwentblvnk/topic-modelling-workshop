Samandriel is a 5-piece melodic metal band based out of Edmonton, Canada. The band was founded by guitarist Oskar Jankovic and bassist Ryan Hopper in 2008, and it wasn't until early 2009 that the band found a full lineup featuring operatic female vocals, symphonic keyboards, melodic hooks, rythmic dexterity and dramatic atmosphere.
