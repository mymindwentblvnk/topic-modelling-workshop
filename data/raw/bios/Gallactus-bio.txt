Gallactus is formerly Galactus 77, but because of being lumped in with Blink 182, Sum 41 and such they dropped the 77 and added an "l" (for copyright reasons).
Cosmic Bong Doom from the Canucks! Bongzilla-meets-Church of Misery-meets Entombed for a breakfast of coffee, bud and cement nails. Gallactus started in 2001 in Sussex, New Brunswick, Canada. The band members are: Dan Hodgson (vox), Shaun Crawford (bass), Chris Crawford (drums) and Jayson McAllister (guitar). Fueled by the riffs of Black Sabbath and songs about giant robots, deep sea tyrants and alien drug dealers. Gallactus has shared the stage with bands such as Alexisonfire, Goat Horn, Rammer, Ion Dissonance, Misery Index, Neuraxis, Bucket Truck, Iron Giant, At The Mercy of Inspiration, and many other local acts. Gallactus has never denied its influence from geek and pop culture. Lyrically, the bandâ€™s songs centre around video game characters, 80s cartoon shows and sci-fi. Their take on the 1985 Transformers movie even shaped their 2005 e.p. Teletran 1. Like the metal titan it is named after, Gallactus is here to consume your world.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gallactus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
