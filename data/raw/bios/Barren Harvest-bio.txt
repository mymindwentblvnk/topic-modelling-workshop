1) Barren Harvest is a somber, ethereal collaboration between Lenny Smith (Atriarch) and Jessica Way (Worm Ouroboros). The music composed by these two creative veterans is cold and bright, pierced by measured silence and whispering tones, swells of synth, haunting guitars and autoharp. Dark, refined neofolk meets ambient post-punk in a ghostly fog as dual voices lament lost loves, decaying flesh, and Nature's fragile beauty. 

2) Primordial and mangled black metal delivered in a steady and lifeless clatter. Gnashing guitars and tortured howls lay bare a desolate vision to encapsulate the listener in woebegone despair. Cassette distributed by Youth Attack in 2013.
