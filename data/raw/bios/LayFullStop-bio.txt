LayFullstop is a Jazztronica/Christian artist from Manchester, by way of Birmingham. From Lay’s accredited first project ‘The Blue Compilation’, she has come a long way from her signature jazz-infused, lo-fi sound, and delivery. With her Christian faith as the driving force behind the shift, Lay’s music is more than just sonics but holds deeper sentiments consisting of spirituality, hope, and hardships. LayFullstop’s upcoming mixtape “STiR” sets to do just that, screaming of newfound independence and a unique appreciation for jazz music.

A prolific creative, she has built momentum with her shows across the UK and across Europe. Not forgetting 2019 Lay’s Cherries EP, and A COLORS SHOW performance which garnered the attention of tastemakers and publications around the world, all of who are anticipating the next release of the forthcoming mixtape “STiR”. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/LayFullStop">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
