Arcanum Inferi is an italian black metal band formed in 2009.
To music the complex ermetic/alchemical symbology, describing the operations and the rituals related to the pure occidental esoteric Tradition, telling the report of the journeys to hell by Artifex and his demonic meetings…This is the mission led by Arcanum Inferi. From the darkest visions of the human soul, Baram, MaagherKxeratum, Sethyel and Frozen, extrapolate that strange state of indisposition linked to the achievement of the self consciousnessf.Getting the rituals, the operations and the acts from the highest antiquity, to perform the goal for this purpose, the four people pose again the ancestral knowledge, born from time out of mind, and orally handed down by teacher to follower in the course of millenniums. These themes are called for short: Arcanum Inferi.

"Arcanum" is etymologically bounded to the word "arca", so there's a clear allusion to a container which, obviously, carries something but in the mean time hide this "something"; from here the links with all that is mysterious, hidden to the mob. The word inferi is formed of "in" (inside) and "ferre" (to bring), so it suggests "to bring into". So we could translate Arcanum Inferi as "the whole of knowledge handed down in a hidden way to the people, that give to the artifex/miste/wizard the means to become aware of oneself". In simpler words, Arcanum Inferi propose our esoteric Tradition, with all its complex symbologies and the non less mysterious rituals, as the highest way to reach the eternity of the Awareness given by Lucifer. Conscious of this thing, we silently proceed on this Earth, children of the Night and of the shiny Sirius, warriors of a struggle without time, eternal Lords of the sidereal immensity set beyond human taste… <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/ARCANUM+INFERI">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
