Echo Lake formed late in 2010 after Thom Hill and Linda Jarvis met studying at art school in South London. The ex-choir girl’s voice perfectly suited Hill’s Brian Wilson-meets-Galaxie 500 productions and they set about work on a new project. A songwriting and recording duo (fleshed out to a five piece for rare live dates), the act were picked up by cult London label No Pain In Pop. Fourteen months later and debut album 'Wild Peace' is a considered, singular work brashly proving right all the hype. Marrying Hill’s huge, dense production style with countless interweaving layers of Jarvis’ emotive and cavernous voice the tracks seem to float like the densest of mirages, maintaining a majestic indie-rock classicism. Echo Lake released their second album, Era, in march 2015.
