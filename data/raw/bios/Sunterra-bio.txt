Sunterra are a gothic metal band from Vienna, Austria. The band were formed in 1994 under the name Virgin Seed, and played psychedelic rock. They revised their music style in 1998, and with the addition of Lilly, Chris, and finally Carlos, the band's sound evolved into its final form: aggressive, highly melodic, and featuring a blend of melancholic female vocals, black metal rasps, and growled vocals. Their first LP, "Lost Time", was released in 2002 via W.A.B. Records. Their second LP, "Graceful Tunes", was released in 2005 via CCP Records. 

"Sunterra" is a combined word that represents both "fire" and "earth".  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sunterra">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
