Touch Of Death is a five-piece Melodic Death Metal band from Szeged, Hungary. The band was founded in 2006 by Mihály Lóczi . Unfortunatelly the members always changed. The band was reaching the current line-up in fall of 2009.

The name of the band is more than a simple name. The Touch Of Death is a feeling, which you feel, when you have an accident, but you don't die. You feel an amazing feeling, you get frightened, your heart beats as fast as a machinegun and you think "I will be dead!!!". But no! You don't die. This is the Touch Of Death.
