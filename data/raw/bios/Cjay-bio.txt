CJay (born and raised in Broward County, Florida) is an American rapper also known in his earlier days as Real Prophecy. He started his rap career at the age of 14 and later started posting his music on SoundCloud which led his song “52 Bars” to blow up and lead him into bigger platforms like Spotify and Apple Music. He was influenced by various 90s and early 00s rappers such as 2Pac, Nas, Eminem, Canibus, The Notorious B.I.G, Jay-Z, 50 Cent, Andre 3000 and more. Although he was inspired by these old school rappers, he still delivers both commercial, mainstream sounds as well as his old school boom bap type rap. 

He released his first album “The Boom Bap Album” June 24th, 2016 and later released “The South Flo EP” November 25th, 2017. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cjay">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
