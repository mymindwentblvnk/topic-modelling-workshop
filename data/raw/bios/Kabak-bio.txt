[1994 - 2002]
Without a doubt this one of the best bands from El Salvador and Central America, they call their music "Bestial Death Grind". The band began in October 31 of 1994 with the original line up consisting in Jorge Lopez (guitars), Julio Garcia (bass) and Rodrigo Artiga (drums and vocals). 

Kabak is a Russian word that signifies a place were people go and have a good time, a place were people can meet without any laws (this must be the Russian word for Internet). They are probably the best known band outside of El Salvador. The guys all lived close to each other and decided to form a band. They site as influences Helloween, Mercyful Fate, Slayer, Anthrax (?), D.R.I. (Old), Cannibal Corpse and Napalm Death. In 1995 they released their demo with Mexico's American Line Productions (ALP) called "30 weeks of Defecation" which consisted of 5 songs: "Restos", "Parasitos Incontrolables de Putrefaccion", "30 Semanas de Defecacion", "Porfirio Corpse" y "Legacy of Blood" (cover). After the release of their demo they began to work on new material, that's when the bassist Julio Garcia suffered a motorcycle accident injuring his right arm, and leaving him unable to play bass. Auditions were held for a new bassist and Ciro a friend of the bands took Julio Garcia's place. The band recently recorded their first CD titled "Descomposicion Cerebral" distributed by ALP from Mexico to countries such as USA, South America, Japan, Germany, Spain, France, Italy, Holland and others. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kabak">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
