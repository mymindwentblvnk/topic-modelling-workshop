The Committee (2007 - present) is a 5-soul strong collective of international members who dedicate themselves to the art of black / doom metal. The Committee does not conform or support ANY political ideology.  Some of the listeners find the topics of band very controversial, however rest assured! The aim of the band is to present historic facts in a new light and from a new point of view. The motto of the band is: “History is written by the victors. We are the voice of the dead”.  The Committee is a collaboration. The band works with guest artists and vocalists in order to expand the boundaries of Metal. 

In the winter of 2007 the roots of The Committee have been planted. It started with a one man project drafted by Igor Mortis. After the project remained dormant for some time, it accidentally was discovered by the drummer William A, who ( after some encouragement ) succeeded in forming a 5-soul strong musical collective. The demo "Holodomor" has been released in the beginning of 2013. The Full album "Power Through Unity" is released in February 2014 by Folter Records. Currently the band is preparing international live shows and new material.

The Committee began as a Black/Doom Metal collaboration. The sound can be described as deep and guttural with an appealing and hypnotic monotone character.  The expression of pure misery and suffering is prevalent throughout the whole ensemble. The band is focussing on creating a well balanced album that fits into a one concept, rather than a melange of separate songs. In order to preserve the original intended character and feeling of the music, sound effects and keyboards are kept to the bear minimum.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Committee">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
