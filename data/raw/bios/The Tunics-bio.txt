In 2008 The Tunics broke out of Croydon as teenagers with a gift for effortless wit and lyrics infused with social critique and wisdom beyond their years. However, they did this without forgetting the infectious, high energy, indie guitar riffs that sold out shows of dancing and moshing teenagers and that got them banned from playing in a venue or two in their early days as Croydon cult favorites.

Fast forward to 2010, and The Tunics and BMG are proud to announce the release of their long-awaited 2nd album on the 21st of February 2011. Their debut single, “Cost of Living”, released in 2008 quickly garnered significant critical acclaim from the likes of NME to bloggers and industry insiders from all over the world. Video playlists in the UK (E4, NME TV) alongside radio play in indie stations in Germany, Australia, U.S., Greece— to name a few— helped establish a new cult following far beyond the boundaries of the A23 and Croydon, and set things in motion for the band.

The upcoming album is a result of a more serious and mature band that has reined in and honed its raw, bursting talent. Two years of touring the UK and Europe with the likes of Bombay Bicycle Club and Nada Surf, playing at T in the Park, and continuous songwriting and experimentation have taught them a few lessons, and resulted in a more secure, yet somber, band. Out with the indie pop riffs, and in with a fuller, more ethereal sound that retains the powerful, elegant lyrics that are meant to entertain, perplex, and spark meaningful thought.

First single “Low” will be released on the 13th of December.

The Tunics are Joe Costello (vocals & guitar), Scott Shepherd (bass guitar), James Booth (keys), and Simon Hargreaves (drums)
