there is more than one band with the name "telepathy"

1. UK experimental metal.

‘Thought post-metal had nothing left to say? Well, Telepathy just read your mind.
Now let them prove you wrong’ – KKKK Kerrang!

TELEPATHY formed in 2011, the product of three Polish brothers (Piotr, Albert, and Krystian Turek) and one English guitarist (Richard Powley), later joined by bassist Teddy James Driscoll. - Telepathy's sound, seldom disassociated with the words 'post-metal', is often likened to genre megastars Cult of Luna, Russian Circles and Neurosis. Yet, in a manner befitting the transcendental nature of the practice itself, Telepathy's music surpasses the archetypal sensory confinements that ensnare bands of a similar ilk. 

2. Korean newwave punk band.

3. US thrash metal band from Buffalo, New York
Very good speed/thrash metal with a classic edge mixing the speedy riffage of the Bay-Area with the sharp mid-paced one of Anthrax. "Legions of Frustration" is a cool up-tempo thrasher, but "Reality" introduces a nice balladic section, which is like an oasis amidst the sharp lashing more mid-tempo guitars. "Orlock" will break your neck thrashing far and wide in the best tradition of the Forbidden debut. "Raging Side" is only a bit more controlled with slower sections scattered around, but "Medieval Times" will throw you into a spontaneous headbanging again, despite another not as fast break, and the more melodic guitar hooks. "Innocence" could be considered the ballad, heavy and less dynamic, but the riffage is good, and the singer gives out a standout performance. He actually sings quite well on the whole album, albeit seldom changing his high clean tember which comes as a nice mix between a higher-pitched Joey Belladonna and Michael "M.A.J.O.R." Knoblich (Scanner, Jester's March).
