Tsatthoggua was a black metal band obsessed with the BDSM worship. The band was found in 1989 in Marl (North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany). Having their name extracted from a Howard Philips Lovecraft work, Tsatthoggua were formed in the city of Marl in 1989 having split-up in the year 2000. They left behind one demo, "Siegeswille" (1995), one EP entitled "German Black Metal" and two full-length albums, "Hosanna Bizarre" (1996), "Trans Cunt Whip" (1998).

A new album "Extazia" (2000) was recorded and finished, but due to bad management on the record label's (Necropolis Records) part, it was never released.

Tsatthoggua split 23rd of June, 2000.
