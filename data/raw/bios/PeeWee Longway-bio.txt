The rapper who got in under the wire -- being the last MC signed to Gucci Mane 's 1017 Records before the label boss went to prison -- Peewee Longway is also the leader of the MPA Bandcamp crew. The Atlanta rapper introduced those initials in 2013 with his debut 1017 Records  mixtape, Money, Pounds, Ammunition. The MPA Bandcamp debuted that same year as a sprawling crew with a loose membership that numbered over a dozen, all members sharing a first name like MPA Longway, MPA Duke, MPA Mitch, and MPA Spud. In 2014 he collaborated with Gucci Mane  on the split release World War 3D: The White Album and joined Gucci  and Young Dolph  in the Brick Squad supergroup Felix Brothers. He also launched his Blue M&M series of mixtapes in 2014 while Money, Pounds, Ammunition, Vol. 2, with the MPA Bandcamp, now going by just MPA, dropped in 2015. In a busy 2016, Peewee issued the third installment of Money, Pounds, Ammunition, as well as his debut LP, Mr. Blue Benjamin. Featuring appearances by LoLife Blacc, Gucci Mane, Young Dolph, Wiz Khalifa, and Juicy J, the full-length peaked at 24 on the Billboard Top Rap Albums chart. He closed out the year with the release of the Longway Sinatra mixtape, a collaboration with Cassius Jay. Blue M&M 3 arrived the next summer, with Spaghetti Factory landing in spring 2018 and State of the Art dropping later that winter. In 2019 he teamed up Money Man for the collaborative LP Long Money. ~ David Jeffries, Rovi <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/PeeWee+Longway">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
