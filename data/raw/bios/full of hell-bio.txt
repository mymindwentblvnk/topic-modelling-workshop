Full of Hell is a metal band formed in 2009 and based in Ocean City, Maryland and central Pennsylvania. Their sound is an amalgam of 90s grindcore/metalcore, sludge metal and noise; in addition, Full of Hell incorporates industrial and power electronics, which is usually interspersed throughout their relentless grinding death, although they have released a handful of power electronics-only recordings. They were signed to A389 Recordings, through which they released two full length albums, Roots of Earth Are Consuming My Home (2011) and Rudiments of Mutilation (2013). During that era, they also put out split EPs with Code Orange Kids, Goldust, and Calm the Fire. As previously stated, Full of Hell have also released power electronics recordings, some of which are contained within the four part FOH NOISE series, each volume of which was originally released on cassette through various labels; and the others are splits with The Guilt Øf... and Psywarfare. 
In 2014, Full of Hell signed with Profound Lore and recorded a full-length collaboration album with Merzbow as their debut release with the label. Full of Hell has also since collaborated with The Body twice, put out the Amber Mote In The Black Vault 7", a split 7" with Nails, a couple of live tapes, and released a solo LP (the first in 4 years) entitled Trumpeting Ecstasy—their second full length with Profound Lore. Most recently, Full of Hell released a limited split 7" with Intensive Care.
