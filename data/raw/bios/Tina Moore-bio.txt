Tina Moore came onto the scenes in 1995 with her self-titled debut album. The album had minor hits with "Color Me Blue" reaching #73 on the R&B charts, "Never Gonna Let You Go" reaching #27 and "All I Can Do" peaking at #48.

Since then, Moore has released two more albums. In 2000, she released All In My Vibe and in 2002, she released Time Will Tell.

A remixed version of Never Gonna Let You Go was released in the UK in 1997 and was a major top 10 hit. It was one of the earliest Garage songs to enter the charts, and is considered one of the most important Garage releases of all time. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tina+Moore">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
