Simple Kid (born Ciaran McFeely) is an Irish solo musician known for his trancey/synth sound and his "simple" approach to making and performing his music. Simple Kid's approach to recording is different than others in that raw recordings are made to an 8-track cassette player which he then feeds into his computer for mixing and mashing into the final song. 

Before becoming Simple Kid, Ciaran was a member of The Young Offenders. Forming when he was 17, the band was composed of friends made while growing up in Cork, Ireland. The group attempted to release an album in America but was met with failure and broke up.

All tracks on Simple Kid's debut album 1 are mixed and mastered from his own recordings, on his own equipment, by himself. His second release 2 was put out in the UK in 2006, and the US in 2007.

His style of remixing and sampling has been compared to Fatboy Slim, although Simple Kid uses his own recordings as sources. Simple Kid's sound is difficult to place, but could be best described as folk trance-pop with an edge. 

Although having spent considerable time in America before becoming Simple Kid, his popularity today is mostly limited to the United Kingdom. His touring is based out of London and he has most recently supported Bell X1 during their Ireland & UK tour in 2006. Previously, Simple Kid has toured with such acts as Travis, the Thrills, Ocean Colour Scene, Suede and Richard Ashcroft.
