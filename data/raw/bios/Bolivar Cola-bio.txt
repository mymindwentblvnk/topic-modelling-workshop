Bolivar Cola is a Russian rock band founded in Moscow in 2013. The group's musical style (which the band calls "boogie doom") was greatly influenced by psychedelic and hard rock music of the 1970's, as well as by modern stoner and occult rock. The band extends the boundaries of the genre by adding the elements of ethnic music, folk instruments, and operatic singing. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bolivar+Cola">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
