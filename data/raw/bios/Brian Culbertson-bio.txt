Brian Culbertson (born January 12, 1973) is a smooth jazz musician and instrumentalist from Decatur, Illinois, United States. Son of jazz band director and trumpeter Jim Culbertson, Brian's instruments include the keyboard and trombone.

Heavily influenced by funk, much of Culbertson's material is funk-based instrumental, but in recent years has called upon vocalists such as Trey Lorenz, Kenny Lattimore, Will Downing, Faith Evans, and Avant, to add to his pieces.

Culbertson has released twelve albums so far. The first three were on the Blue Moon label: Long Night Out (1994), After Hours (1995) and Modern Life (1995). After moving to the Atlantic label, three more albums followed: Secrets (1997), Somethin' Bout Love (1999), and the critically acclaimed Nice and Slow (2001). Come on Up (2003) was released on Warner Jazz, and Culbertson then moved to GRP for his next albums It's On Tonight (2005), A soulful Christmas (2006), and Bringing back the funk (2008). Then Culbertson moved to Verve for his next album Live from the inside (2009). His latest work XII was released by GRP (2010).

Brian Culbertson also works with many other musicians in the smooth jazz arena, often as a composer and arranger. Culbertson is credited with working with Dave Koz, Peter White, Richard Elliot and Michael Lington to name but a few.
