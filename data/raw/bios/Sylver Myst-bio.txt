In the year 2009 Sylver Myst stands for catchy melodic progressive metal.
The female front, Tasmara Kel, sets emotions in motion with her timbre. The mostly autobiographical lyrics are a reflection of the inner self.
The music gives a feel of pleasure and aggression, mixed and dosed in the right proportions. A new adventure for everyone’s intention.

The gothic band born in 2001 is based around the guitarists Rob van Dijk and Didier Roumen. After the mini-cd cd “Depths Of Illusions” and the Gothic Festival “Summer Darkness” the band gets a rapid lift.

January 2006 Sylver Myst signs a contract with the American label Sirenette Musical Industries. For this label the band records the cd “Emotions Revealed” with producer Hand Pieters in the Excess studio Rotterdam. 15 September 2006 they release this varied album. 

Sparkling performances follow and the band can look back proudly on stages like Paradiso, 013, Tivoli, Bibelot, Metropool, Plato and Nirwana and beside that, they played with multiple nationally and internationally valued acts like After Forever, Entwine, Tanzwut, Leaves Eyes and Autumn.

Beginning 2009 the band gets ready for the next promo release. Completed with Bart Engelen on drums and Tasmara Kel as leading lady, the band records their next single “Turning Point”. This time the Excess studio’s are visited again. A good magic between Hans Pieters and the band appears. The new songs show the progression the band has made in every way.
With “Entangled By Lies” and “My 3rd Eye” the “renewed” Sylver Myst sets everyone on fire again.
