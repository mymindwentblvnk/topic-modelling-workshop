The garage-punk and acid-corroded new-wave outfit that is Chemtrails first emerged as a 5-piece in 2016, having started life as the lo-fi bedroom recording project of romantic partners Mia Lust and Laura Orlova. They were quickly snapped up and signed by Swedish label PNKSLM Recordings, having only played one gig — at Trans Pride Brighton. Since then, the prolific band has built up a die-hard following and churned out four critically-acclaimed DIY records in two years. Their three 6-song EPs and debut full-length album, all of which were recorded in their living room, have garnered praise from the likes of KEXP, Stereogum, DIY Mag and The Line of Best Fit, with the LP “Calf of the Sacred Cow” appearing in the top 25 of the “best albums of the year” lists of Swedish music magazines Gaffa and Hymn in 2018.

The band cites their biggest influences as the Pixies, Blondie, Oh Sees, Black Lips and sixties psych and garage punk, but holding everything together is Mia Lust’s ear for melody and no shortage of hooks. Served on a bed of fuzzy guitars and polychromatic pop, the lyrics center around alienation, love, the human condition, the impending apocalypse and, occasionally, on Lust’s place in the world as a transgender woman.

2019 saw Chemtrails play a live session for KEXP as part of their International Clash Day celebration in London, after which the band focussed on recording album number two. “The Peculiar Smell of the Inevitable”, to be released in May 2020 on PNKSLM Recordings, will be the band’s heaviest and wildest record yet, with their trademark big melodies and harmonies performed over a frenzied wall of raw guitar noise and glistening synths.

After their bandmates went their separate ways to pursue other projects Lust and Orlova relocated to Manchester from London in late 2019. They’ve now recruited a whole new lineup, bringing a fresh burst of excitement and ideas to the band.
