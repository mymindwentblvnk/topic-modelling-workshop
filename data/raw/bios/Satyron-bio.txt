Satyron was originally put together by Matti Rahkonen and Jussi Peltonen in 1997, somewhere in Finland. The bands these guys had played in earlier had fallen apart, and it was time to start a new project.
In spring 2000 Satyron released their first EP, Snowfall. It included five songs: Snowfall, Tears Will Vanish, Season of Floods, Bending the Truth and All the Memories. It was practically sold out in few weeks.
