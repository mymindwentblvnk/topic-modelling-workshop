Chris Walla (born November 2, 1975 in Bothell, Washington) is the guitarist and producer for the band Death Cab for Cutie. He released his debut solo album Field Manual on January 29, 2008 on Barsuk records. He has released previous solo material exclusively from his website, including material from an early solo project called Martin Youth Auxiliary. Most of these releases have never been fully exposed to the general public in any other form. Under Martin Youth Auxiliary, one cassette was recorded and released in 1999 on Elsinor records; only several dozen copies were made. Walla has produced, recorded and mixed many albums of artists such as The Decemberists, Nada Surf, The Long Winters, Travis Morrison (formerly of The Dismemberment Plan), The Velvet Teen, Hot Hot Heat, and many more. His most recent project as a producer was the album Sainthood by Tegan and Sara which is set to release October 27, 2009. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Chris+Walla">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
