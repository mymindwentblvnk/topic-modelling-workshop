Fallen Up is a young Austrian Metal-Band who started up in January 2006. Lukas (E-Guitar), Patrick (at that time also E-Guitar) and David (E-Bass and Vocals) emulated their idols, Metallica" and "Rammstein" (nowadays including "Machine Head", they are still the greatest influences on the band). After the trio had tried out several drummers, Patrick decided to do this job. Months later their second talented guitarist Martin joined the band. Their musical style is composed by rythmic and/or melodic metal riffs, haevy moshparts and critical and/or rather emotional lyrics about important issues like love, death, war and suicide. Since that, "Fallen Up" has recorded 13 songs and played several concerts. They are about to release their debut album which will contain the latest 10 of them. They are on the best way to make themselves a name in the Metal-scene! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fallen+Up">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
