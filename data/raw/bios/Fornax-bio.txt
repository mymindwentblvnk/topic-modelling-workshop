Russian project Fornax was found in March 2006 by Nullklever. It all started with experiments with noise and ambient music. Later rhythmical experiments occurred. Thus, it was decided not to constrain the project by stylistic restrictions. The concept foundation of the music is space in all of its representations; they are cosmonautics in the past and the future, the universe as a life form, alien nations and distant worlds. As well as hi-tech, anomalous effects, super-nature capabilities, life after death, cyberpunk representation of the future, sci-fi, futurism, etc. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fornax">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
