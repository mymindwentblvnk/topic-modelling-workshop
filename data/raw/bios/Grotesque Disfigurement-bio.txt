Grotesque Disfigurement is a Brutal Death Metal band with some Slam influence. First starting out with only one member(Caldwell), Grotesque Disfigurement released a 2008 Promo with 9 slamming tracks, he decided he wanted to do more with this project, and needed a vocalist full time. After a short search Steve joined the band and both are currently writing a full length album.
