There are three artists called Ajna: Dark ambient project,  goa trance producer, and an Industrual thrash metal band.

Ajna is a dark ambient/drone/post-industrial project of Chris F from New York and has been active since 2008. This project touches upon themes such as existentialism, metaphysics, the subconscious mind, mysticism, and so forth. Since 2012, Ajna has released on several different labels with both digital and physical releases, and has collaborated with artists across the globe. Ajna's sound has often been described as obscure, isolationist, nightmarish and otherworldly. In 2017, Ajna took a quantum leap into the dark ambient world by signing with the Cyclic Law label. Since then there has been a significant progression in both production and conceptualization. His latest release was "Oracular" in March, 2020.

Ajna the goa trance producer: Based in Orl√©ans, France, also known as Olivier Chazard.

Ajna the industrial thrash metal band: from Brazil, formed in 1991.
