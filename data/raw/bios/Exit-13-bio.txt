Exit-13 was a grindcore band from Millersville, Pennsylvania, USA, which was formed in 1989. As the band experienced multiple line-up changes, Bill Yurkiewicz (Namanax, Never Healed, PICA, Purge, and Solarus) had been the only constant member until the project quit in 1997.

Exit-13's discography spanned almost 15 releases, including three full-length studio albums Green Is Good! (1990), Ethos Musick (1994), and Smoking Songs (1996). Genrewise, the band played noisy grindcore of relatively traditional form with lyrics devoted to political and social issues.
