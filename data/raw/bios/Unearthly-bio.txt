One of the most notorious black metal bands hailing from Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), Unearthly was established by the end of 1998, with M. Mictian on bass and Lord Thoth on guitars and vocals. 
Their first demo, "Blessed are the Destroyers of False Hope", was released in june 2000, and the second one, "Living Under the Sign of Blasphemy" was launched a little over one year afterwards in august 2001. Both works had good acceptance within the scene and received good reviews, which guaranteed them many concerts in their native country. But it was only in 2002 that "Infernum - Prelude to a New Reign", their debut album, was released in Brazil via Encore Records and in the US and Canada via Crash Music Records.

After performing live in Brazil's most important cities and festivals, UNEARTHLY started recording their second album. Released by the end of 2003, "Black Metal Commando" - produced by Fabiano Penna (ex-Rebaelliun, now in The Ordher) - showed more death metal influences, although still maintaining a black metal identity. 

By the middle of 2004, Lord Thoth, co-founder and singer, left the band and was replaced by Agares (ex-Mysteriis, who performed in all the concerts of the "War Massacre" Tour in that same year. Agares left the band shortly after that and his place was taken over by Eregion, who remains as the band's frontman until the present day.

In 2007, UNEARTHLY toured throughout many countries in South America and in 2008, commemorating their 10th anniversary, their current label, Free Mind Records, re-released their first albums and also a live one (Revelations of Holy Lies) and a compilation (Black Biography - Unmercyful Personalized Bestiality). Also, they recorded, mixed and mastered their upcoming release, "Age of Chaos", which should be out in may or june of 2009 (a single has been released and some tracks can now be downloaded for free via their official MySpace profile.

Unearthly has already performed artists such as Malevolent Creation, Behemoth, Hate Eternal, Iconoclasm, Sepultura, Desaster and Krisiun.
