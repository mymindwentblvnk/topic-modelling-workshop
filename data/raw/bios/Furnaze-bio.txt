Founded by Belgian guitarist OLIVIER VERMEERSCH, FURNAZE started up playing Metal covers but soon began writing original material, culminating in the release of "LAME BRAIN SOCIETY" – an EP with six tracks of hard hitting "in the face" tunes. Powerful drums, fast and furious guitars combined with solid rhythms and catchy riffs make FURNAZE a welcome break from run of the mill Metal outfits. After a few line-up changes FURNAZE were joined by ANDIE CAYNE on bass and concentrated on writing and recording new material, with their album “NO STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN” demonstrating mature song writing and individual style. Numerous live performances followed, with FURNAZE building a strong and loyal following along the way.
FURNAZE have recently returned from a successful major European tour, with session drummer JASON BOWLD (Pitchshifter, Fightstar) adding extra power and drive. In March 2010, FURNAZE support OBITUARY in the UK and are joined by powerhouse ADRIAN ERLANDSSON (Paradise Lost) on drums.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Furnaze">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
