NECROCULT is born in South of France in 1994 with Loran, David and Manu. First the band evolved in a thrash/death metal style, then quickly gave itâ€™s first shows on the local scene. In 1997 Loran brought the second voice and black metal influences, offering dark, brutal and epic sound to the music. Ever evolving, ever playing live performances.

In 2003 first self-titled album "NECROCULT" was released by Snakebite productions, reflecting the band's spirit, such in music than in the production: without concessions. The album recieved good critics in France and worlwide.

Last decade, Necrocult plays numerous shows in France with ENSLAVED, TEMPLE OF BAAL, MERRIMACH, ASMODEE, RITUALIZATION, MALHKEBRE, SVART CROWN, MANZER, KILLERS, OTARGOS, THE SEVEN GATES...

In 2013 Necrocult entered studio to record his second opus "For Thine Is The Kingdom, And The Power, And The Glory" that will be released by the dark alliance of Satanath Records and IRA Militias. 6 tracks for more than 40 minutes an elaborate dark and brutal black death metal, witness of incessant confrontation between two voices. Necrocult also offers a reflection on the journey, the mistakes, of the soul and his accession, deserved or not to the Final Thruth.
