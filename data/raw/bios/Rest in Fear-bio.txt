Rest In Fear is an Austrian Melodic Death Metal band. Catchy guitar- and keyboard melodies, a fast second guitar and rock-influenced baselines as well as the resolute rhythmic mix of vocals and drums, both reaching from traditional metal styles to progressive experiments, define the bandâ€˜s music.

Their debut-album "Insert Yourself" picks out as a central theme self-reflection and discrepancy of an individual which desires a harmonic society, but realises, that that very state is not approachable without his own help.

The band perceives their music as an epicenter of a young and socially critical movement of contemplative individuals and as a counter-movement to both, naive depoliticization and right-wing demagogic misuse of the musical youth culture. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rest+In+Fear">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
