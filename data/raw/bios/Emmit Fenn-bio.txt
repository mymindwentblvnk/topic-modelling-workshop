Raised in Berkeley, California, Emmit Fenn is a singer, songwriter, and producer of offbeat, cinematic soundscapes in the realm of indie electronica. Fenn first turned to the piano and composing at the age of 12 as a means of distraction when his parents separated. He later picked up the guitar and violin and went on to study composition and music theory. He was in college when his single "Painting Grey," released in 2015, became a viral hit, accumulating millions of plays. Fenn dropped out of school and signed with TH3RD BRAIN Records, which released another downtempo streaming hit, "Blinded," in 2016. "Modern Flame," featuring Yuna, followed suit in 2017 as he prepared his debut EP, Eclipse.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Emmit+Fenn">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
