Contrast the Water is a Groove/Death Metal band from Durban, South Africa, formed around 2006.

The idea for Contrast the Water started brewing in vocalist Barryâ€™s mind about two years ago. He finally sold the idea to Grant friend and colleague, and the planning began.  The idea was to make extreme metal that was socially conscious and had a message about the serious decline of morality in our country, and the troubling phenomenon of people in SA beginning to accept violence and degradation as part of their lives.

The end of 2006 saw a line up change with Raymond taking over playing the drums, he has fitted in very well with the band and has added a lot more diversity to the music. By 2010 the lineup had changed again over time to fit a more solid sound and more intense music with thick groove!
