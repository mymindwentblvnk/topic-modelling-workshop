For a while, the most hyped line-ups and projects on the Austrian music scene had names such as Kruder & Dorfmeister, Dzihan & Kamien, Pulsinger & Tunakan. They were simply the names of the protagonists who put the Vienna Sound on the music map in the 90s and came to represent a whole new pop/electronic image. So when the name Binder & Krieglstein appeared, it was bound to make you think that this was just somebody else jumping on the bandwagon. Far from it: the name itself reflects the wit, irony and whimsicality of Rainer Binder-Krieglstein from Graz. The name may sound like a ‘duo’, but there’s only one person behind it.

“Punky Lo-Fi with attitude, trashy elektronic sounds and a generous portion of humour” is how FM4 described his debut album “International” in which the drummer who had previously played with Fetish 69, Sans Secours, Toxic Lounge,Mika and various jazz bands, showed what he could do. Samples, loops and sounds all held together by the drumming and vision of Binder-Krieglstein. It is important for Rainer to make music with people he likes – no matter what the style. As long as the chemistry is right, anything goes: electronic, brass band or pop.

Pure eclecticism? A streetwise lust for life, more like. Wide-ranging minimalism. An urge to capture atmospheres, attitudes and moods and pass them on in distilled form to a surprised and delighted audience. Binder&Krieglstein – live: with room for everything from quirky folk guitar and idiosyncratic double bass to moody downtempo grooves, swinging jazz textures and straight tech-house beats.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Binder+&+Krieglstein">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
