In 2009 the release of "Inscribed in the victims scars" EP followed by several shows and a tour in the UK. The EP represent a transition phase from the old and the new style. After some changes in the line up the band composed heavier stuff, more technical and brutal, inspired by the masters of american Brutal Death metal and filled with Natrium experimentations.
