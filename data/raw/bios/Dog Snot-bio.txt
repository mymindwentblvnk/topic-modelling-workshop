Formed in the early months of 2011, Dog Snot began life as a joke between 2 musicians who had a passion for extreme metal and a random sense of humour. Within a matter of months, multi instrumentalist/main songwriter Matt Davidson (Repulsive Vision, Luciferus Vargulin) and vocalist, artist and lyricist, Stacey Silver had written and recorded over an hours worth of Traditional deathgrind in the vein of Napalm Death, Terrorizer, Exhumed with a dark comedic edge. Following some attempts at self promotion, the band were offered a slot on three way split featuring two other underground extreme bands to be released digitally on Torn Flesh Records (Trifarious Assault). This collaboration lead to a few other considerations for releases in the near future including splits and compilations with bands from all over the world. The twosome are currently working on completing their debut full length album (entitled Snotgrind) as well as hopefully beginning their live career with the help of local musicians. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dog+Snot">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
