Based in Berlin but originally from Wolverhampton, Fantastic Mr Fox has been producing since the age of 14, his sample-based genre-splicing techniques were learned in the arcane practices of Hip Hop and House. Following releases for Hemlock Recordings and Black Acre, Fantastic Mr Fox supported The XX on tour where he performed DJ sets in-between the Mercury prize winners, Warpaint and Zola Jesus.

His music has gained support from artists and DJs such as Jamie XX, Annie Mac, Huw Stephens, Bjork and James Blake. Although noticeable in its sparse nature, FMF’s catalogue is compiled with only records that matter. From the sprite-baking pixelated chaos of ‘Sketches’ EP through the funereal RnB of both ‘Evelyn’ and ‘San’en’ to steam-engine house anthems like ‘Power’ and ‘The Trap’. Still much a radio regular the elusive Mr Fox has begun crafting his first full length which witnesses a maturity in his songcraft and some very special collaborations. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fantastic+Mr+Fox">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
