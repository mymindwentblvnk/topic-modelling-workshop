A now defunct, but quite unique epic doom metal band from Japan during the 90s. During their existence, they put out two consistent demo releases. Their impact on other bands in the Japanese doom metal community is still mentioned today, although little is known about what the former band members are doing in the present times.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Millarca">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
