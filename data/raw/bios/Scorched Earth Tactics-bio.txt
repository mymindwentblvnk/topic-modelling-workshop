Scorched Earth Tactics was formed in 1996 in Tampere. Clearing the table with a 1997 demo release, which was lauded as a tad immature but with undeniable potential, the band started perfecting their own style.

During the following five years, Scorched Earth Tactics built their HQ, the Kuolio-studio and honed their song writing and producing skills. 2002 saw the release of Scorched earth tactics' "promo '02".

Some interest from labels arose, but nothing concrete came out of it, so the band put together an EP, entitled "Blastradius" through their own Kuolio Records Â­imprint. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Scorched+Earth+Tactics">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
