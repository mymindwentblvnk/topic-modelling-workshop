Bloodred Hourglass, also known as “BRHG”, is a metal band from a small & cold city of Mikkeli, located in the eastern part of Finland. Originally formed in 2005 by Hyvönen (drums) & Koukonen (vocals), and soon joined by bass-player Moilanen and guitarists Nenonen and Tiilikainen, Bloodred Hourglass quickly gathered the knowledge of Finnish metalheads by a few self-released demos and fairly decent amount of gigs played as a non-labeled act. After six years of consistently working on music and destroying the audiences, the time was set to record the very first full-length album, later titled as “Lifebound”.

“Lifebound”, which was recorded at Ansa Studio, Ulvila, Finland, instantly got the attention of various record labels and in April 2012 Bloodred Hourglass signed a deal with Spinefarm Records. Released in August 24th 2012, “Lifebound” received very warm welcome around the world and reached #22 in the official Finnish album chart. It was  later released digitally in the US on November 2012.

While Bloodred Hourglass’s sound is mostly known for it’s supreme energy, skillful guitar-work and a real in-your-face type of attitude, the most noteworthy aspect has always been the wide scale of influences building this up to the variety it is, standing out from the oversupply of today.   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bloodred+Hourglass">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
