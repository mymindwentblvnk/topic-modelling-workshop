Guitar songwriting and electronic music production, captivate the new music artist, Loryn.  Experimental in nature, provocative in metaphor and mellifluous in sound, art truly is music and the ritual of this practice.

Writing poetry at an early age began the footwork and substance of his projections and aspirations to create sound.  Shortly after, the desire of songwriting led to picking up a guitar.  During this period, songs upon songs were written.
