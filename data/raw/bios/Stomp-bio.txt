STOMP, a combination of percussion, movement and visual comedy, was created in Brighton, UK, in the summer of 1991. It was the result of a ten year collaboration between its creators, Luke Cresswell and Steve McNicholas.

The cast members of Stomp are a diverse group of talented performers from around the world, but they all speak the language of rhythm.
