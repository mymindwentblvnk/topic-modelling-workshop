INCURSUS was initiated by VJS in 2001 after the demise of obscure black metal isolationists BLACK WINTERS EVE. After recording several demos circulated to literately a handful of individuals, INCURSUS somehow caught the attention of Forever Plagued Records in early 2003. Ixithra of cult titans DEMONCY and then unknown vocalist Horidus soon joined INCURSUS and the 7" EP  "Daemonkult / Black Burial" was recorded and released by Forever Plagued in 2005. After spending many years participating in various black metal covens, VJS and Horidus completed the horrific debut LP "Eternal Funeral Trance" released by Forever Plagued in 2009. Recording sessions for the "Adaestuo" EP were delayed by the suicide of vocalist Horidus in the recording studio in 2012, and "Adaestuo" was finally released by Forever Plagued in the fall of 2013.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Incursus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
