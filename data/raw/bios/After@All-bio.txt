after@all was founded in 1996. The year after the foundation of the band was spent with songwriting, touring, and there were some changes among the members of the band, too. The first promotional material was published in 1997, with the title To many, peace is….  The band took part in many national tours travelling through Hungary more times, performing in the most important places and festivals (Pepsi Island, EFOTT, KOTTA, Mezõtúr, ZED-Festival, Tokaj-Hegyalja Festival), between 1999-2001. New songs were written in this period, which provided the base for an album by 2000-2001. Therefore the members started to record the songs since the spring of 2000. First an EP came out called Chameleon, and with this they contacted many labels. As a result of this Periferic Records, a label specialized in progressive music, (the label of After Crying and Solaris) offered a contract in the summer of 2001. So work began on the first album in the studio owned by the band. As a result of the long process in the studio A.C.I.D. was published in November, 2001. They mix the classical elements of progressive rock with modern and futuristic musical solutions on the album containing 15 tracks, which truly reflect the unique conception and musicality of the band. (f u t u r o c k) Thanks to the label, A.C.I.D. can be bought in 20 countries of the world.
