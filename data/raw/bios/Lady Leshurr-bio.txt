Lady Leshurr is a rapper from Birmingham, England. She is best known for her Queen's Speech series of freestyles, all of which went viral in 2015. Her standout single, Queen's Speech 4, was called "brilliant" and "2015's crowning freestyle" by Spin and got airplay in the UK and attention worldwide. 

Born Melesha Katrina O'Garro BEM in 1988 to parents from the Caribbean Isle of St. Kitts, her first foray was into poetry and writing at age six and releasing her first mixtape at age fourteen. As of 2015, she's put out 9 mixtapes. In her words: "I grew up around music. My mum used to play a lot of reggae like Sister Nancy and Bob Marley around the house so basically, when I was around six, I was messing about and doing my own little raps and songs. My family are all rappers and singers anyway so I was always involved in it from a young age." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lady+Leshurr">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
