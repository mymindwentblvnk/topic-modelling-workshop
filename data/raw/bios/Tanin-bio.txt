T/\NIN is a Melodic Death Metal band which incorporates elements from Depresive, Black and Old School Death Metal.
Biography:
The band was formed in the summer of 2014 in Bucharest, Romania. Guitarists Marius Militaru and Emanuel Ghentu began by experimenting with some metal compositions which they also recorded in an improvised studio. As the songs began to take shape, they decided to put the project in motion. Alina, drawn by the low frequencies and interest in metal music, joined in, occupying the bass position. 
Still, as the drums were missing, the guys decided to make use of the drum machine, developing the project until they could find the person that would fill in the missing spot.
After recording the first EP "A new journey" on the 18th of August 2014, Traian joined the band as a drummer. 
The band is now working on their first album, that is expected to come out somewhere in the spring of 2015. Until then they guys are focusing on live shows and hope that more and more people will listen and enjoy their music.
Description:
Focused on the Death Metal style, the band also incorporates atmospheric and aggressive elements, transposing you to another reality, in a world of demons and useless wars. The voice has a different approach, using a severe tone that completes the fast guitar parts and a deep oppressive voice along the piano parts.
