Uphill Battle was a metalcore band with elements of grindcore and noisecore. The group was based out of Santa Barbara, California, USA.

Uphill Battle received some recognition after releasing Uphill Battle on Relapse Records. Combining the speed and severity of grindcore with a hardcore sense of tension, Uphill Battleâ€™s hectic riffing, strafing percussive assault and tortured vocals purveyed conviction. A high profile tour slot as part of the 2003 Relapse Records Contamination Tour alongside label mates Cephalic Carnage, Dysrhythmia and Mastodon immediately followed, exposing the band to a much wider audience.

Uphill Battle released their second full-length album, Wreck Of Nerves, in 2004. 

In 2006, Uphill Battle disbanded, leaving behind Blurred 1999-2004, a collection of their pre-Relapse rarities, including demo and compilation tracks. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Uphill+Battle">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
