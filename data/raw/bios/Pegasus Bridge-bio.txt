Having tirelessly worked on their craft since inception just over twelve months ago, (and rapidly becoming one of the buzz bands of 2009 in the process), legendary producer John Mitchell (Funeral For A Friend / Kids In Glass Houses / Enter Shikari / You Me At Six) expressed an interest in working with the band and has now captured the energetic and upbeat sound of Pegasus Bridge perfectly.

The melodies are simple and beautiful; the songs rock while remaining delicate and intricate. They are fresh-sounding and timeless; and most importantly, all come packed with hooks that could land a shark. Taking inspiration from a number of influences, spanning various genres, the band creates a unique twist on a modern sound; made-to-fit on any radio station.

Now, the boys are taking the results to every corner of the country with an impressive, relentless touring schedule, the fruits of which have brought the band shows with the likes of InMe, The Subways, Ladyhawke, The Futureheads and Pendulum. And October 2009 saw the Midlands’ biggest radio station – BRMB – vote Pegasus Bridge their Battle of the Bands winners.

The brand parted in July 2011 due to disputes with lead singer- Edward Turner. Turner has since started his own solo project. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pegasus+Bridge">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
