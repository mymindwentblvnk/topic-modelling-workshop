2)-Space Monkey was a British New Wave/Synthpop group from the mid-1980s led by singer, songwriter, and guitarist Paul Goodchild. The group's sole album was 1985's "On the Beam", issued in the UK by Innervision Records and in the USA by MCA.

2)-Space Monkey is now Kfir Shlomovitz.
Kfir (age 32) was born & raised in Germany, had moved to Israel few years ago & created a very strong connection to a local Psy full on world & culture.
His style brings a new dimension to an Israeli full on. It expends its limits with atmosphere waves, electronica intentions & irresistible dance floor energies. His unique sound proportion concentrates the focus on the ideas behind the music, the Goa trance legends & the global evolution elements are the core of this debut album "Psychotic Episode" (January 2004).

Since the release of the first Space Monkey album, Kfir is performing worldwide, created tracks for various compilations & finally had released his second album Space Monkey – "Hyperactive" (January 2006). This album is the second round inside the enlightening sounds of Space Monkey crystal clear productions that sets new boundaries over & over again. Looks like the laws of gravity are out of order.
The new & "dark side" oriented psychedelic full on: faster, harder and happier – simply hyperactive with dominating classic Goa tunes. The perfect blend of psychedelic ground & Goa vibrations. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Space+Monkey">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
