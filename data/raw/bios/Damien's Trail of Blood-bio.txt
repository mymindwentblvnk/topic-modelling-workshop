Reaching you from Portugal, Damien’s trail of blood is a name you soon won’t forget. Band formed in November of 2006, when two old friends (Saruga – Vocals & Gil – Guitar) decide to create something, something that would allow them to exteriorize some of the hate and anger accumulated and stressed over the years, anger and hate extracted from diverse unusual and unfair situations forced to experience throughout the years. Next step of the recently formed band would be to find the elements that would complete the idea. A drummer and a bassist were needed and Saruga and Gil´s first choice for those positions were Gonçalo (Drums) and Balão (Bass), witch accepted the spot right away. Damien´s trail of blood has 8 songs ready for a violent and sweaty concert, and has recorded his first ep (4 songs) during this February and March. The recording sessions are over and we will put some songs online as soon as they become ready. Expect something powerful, raw, violent, angry, and psychotic…
