Razor Sharp Daggar is a one-man D.I.Y Grindcore band started in 2011. Musically RxSxD is a mix of different underground styles from Punk, Crust, D-Beat to Death Metal with old-school Grindcore as the main focus, influenced by Agathocles, ROT, Napalm Death, Discharge, Extreme Noise Terror and the lesser serious Sore Throat and G.G.

Lyrics deal with traditonal Grind themes of a socio-political nature, Atrocities of War and the darker side of humans.
