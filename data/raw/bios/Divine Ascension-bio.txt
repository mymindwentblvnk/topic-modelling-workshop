Female fronted metal has never sounded like this before. Their blend of thick, driving rhythms, atmospheric layers, intricate solos and powerful, emotive vocals has already gathered many new listeners and supporters from all corners of the globe.

Divine Ascension take the genre of female fronted metal to a whole new level. The band continue to surprise metal fans the world over with its iconic breed of melodic/progressive metal. A definite force to be reckoned with in the emerging metal scene, Divine Ascension hail from Melbourne, Australia and are led by the enigmatic Jennifer Borg - a voice once heard, not easily forgotten. DA's second album Liberator is following on from their highly acclaimed debut As The Truth Appears.

Their debut album’s successes were many, brining in rave reviews and allowing the band to play alongside symphonic power metal masters Kamelot during their first ever Australian tour in 2013. The release of Liberator will see Divine Ascension’s reach grow further. Soon metal fans will be split into two groups, those who have heard Divine Ascension and those who are about to.
