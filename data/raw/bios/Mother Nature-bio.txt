1) Mother Nature is an American hip-hop duo from Chicago, IL. 

2) Mother Nature was British psych-folk group formed in 1968 in Chesham, Buckinghamshire, and active into the early 70s. Comprising Steve Norchi (bass), Pete Reynolds (drums), Rod Copping (guitar) and Jon Reeves (guitar), the band released a single in 1971 and a second single in 1972.  
Originally named  Steepy Rojo, when the band was offered a record deal they had to decide on another name and opted for Mother Nature. 
Jon Reeves later quit the band and was replaced by Derik Timms (Peanut Rubble) and Dave Janes on guitars. Pete Reynolds was occasionally replaced by Barney James on drums for some recordings. Reverting to Steepy Rojo, the band eventually split in 1973 with Steve Norchi joining Steve Darrington, Ron Watts and Mark Knopfler in Brewers Droop before re-joining Derik Timms in Homegrown. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mother+Nature">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
