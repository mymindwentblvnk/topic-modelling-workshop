theyre probably most noteable for their song "tribal warfare" singing about the lack of dedication within the punk scene, and how mst punks at the time were more interested in dressing up and fitting into a standard of the subculture
They released 2 live recordings and 4 demos:

Alaska Studio Demo

Tribal Warfare EP
Urgent Act Now... You can help save this country EP


2)  Chaos is an open project for improvisation based in Treviso, IT, and formed in 2002. Open to such an extent to take the liberty to have, as guests, musicians met the very same evening.
