The Kryophere sound has developed in protest to the mediocrity and commercialism in Metal and other music today. The time has come for bands and fans alike to stop looking to the industry's icons for validation of their musicality. Look instead at the fresh talent on offer from a generation of 'future leaders'; people ostracized from the lies and banality of normality by a craving for something new and exciting. The time is near where the legacy of bands like Black Sabbath, Pantera and Decapitated will manifest itself in a new wave of honest metal.

Our shared disrespect at a consumerist dilution of what could be a truly great age in alternative music are the building blocks for the Kryophere mentality; music made for the sake of passion, anger and integrity and not a rat race for money, fleeting glory and self-righteousness.


Armed with a healthy dose of ferocious, unrelenting metal, and a satirical sense of humour, the obnoxious Kryophere will challenge the general public at every given opportunity. Within the band there is a newfound sense of unity, home-grown for sharing with others, and a vision will only grow. Stay tuned and keep in touch, we will see you soonâ€¦
