The story of DAYLIGHT MISERY begins in 2008 by Stamos Kordas and Vassilis Mazaris. At first, the only intention was to record a song in which Efthimis Karadimas of NIGHTFALL would participate, exclusively for personal reasons.
However, as time passed, and through systematic effort, came forth more songs that could form a complete album. And so began the quest for suitable members for the band. A few months later the band was ready to record their debut album “Depressive Icons”. This self financed album contains 9 songs in which, members of the Greek as well as the European Metal scene participate as guests. Names such as Sakis Tolis (ROTTING CHRIST), Efthimis Karadimas (NIGHTFALL), Jakob Batten (ILLDISPOSED) and Seraph (DARK FORTRESS) appear in the album. This debut album was recorded in Grindhouse Studio in Athens and produced by George Bokos (STONE COLD DEAD / ex - ROTTING CHRIST/ex - NIGHTFALL) whereas the drums were recorded in Woodshed Studios in Germany and produced by Victor Bullok (DARK FORTRESS / TRIPTYKON / ex – CELTIC FROST). The artwork for the album was created by Travis Smith (OPETH /DEATH/ NEVERMORE etc).

On January 2010, the band gave their first live performance in Athens as support act for the Swedish band DRACONIAN. Three months later two other live performances followed with KATATONIA and SIRENIA in Athens and Thessaloniki and by the end of 2010 the band also gave some headline performances in Athens, Larisa and once again in Thessaloniki. 

On February 2010, DAYLIGHT MISERY were included in the collection of the British magazine “Terrorizer” with the song “Meadows of Desire” (which later also became the official video clip with a special appearance of Efthimis Karadimas). Through this collection, DAYLIGHT MISERY entered automatically in a competition for unsigned bands, organized by Terrorizer magazine, and a few months later, after the vote of the magazine’s readers, won the competition and earned an appearance in the magazine as well as the chance to include one more of their songs in the collection titled “Fear Candy”.

In 2011, the band is ready for their first European Tour and after many rehearsals, and with a stable form, took part in AEALO EUROPEAN TOURNEE 2011 with ROTTING CHRIST/ OMNIUM GATHERUM/ DARK END/ RIUL DOAMNEI and DE PROFUNDIS. The tour lasted 18 days and began from Zabrze in Poland on 28/04/2011, followed by countries such as Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Rumania, Romania, Bulgaria, Bosnia Herzegovina, Croatia, Slovenia, Austria, Switzerland and Italy. A few days later, the band performed again in Athens as support act for the Swedish band DARK TRANQUILLITY and that was the last live performance for the promotion of “Depressive Icons”.

In 2012 the second full length album will be released. With new members, new logo and new sound the band will begin the recordings on the first days of September.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Daylight+Misery">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
