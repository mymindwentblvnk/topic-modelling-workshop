Formed in 1987 under the name Herriot, Prosector were a thrash metal band from Szczecin, Poland, active from 1987 (when they changed their name from Herriot to Prosector) to 1989. They released the demo "Total Shit" in 1987. In 1988 Jacek Gnieciecki and Marcin Gniba decided to have their very own Prosector incarnation due to some troubles with the other members. At a certain moment there were two bands named Prosector in Szczecin. The original band disbanded few months after Jacek, the main composer, and Marcin left the band. The second Prosector then recorded the second demo, "Terrible Ceremony", with Mariusz Gacka on vocals and drums. In 1989 the band split up because of army duties of Jacek Gnieciecki. Gaca & Gnibol formed Strawberry, a hardcore band, which released a demo called "Złapany na gorącym uczynku". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/prosector">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
