Demoniacal Possession's roots can be traced back to 2005 when Invocator made a few home recordings. None of them were ever released except for two tracks on the self-titled demo. After years of not being able to find the right people to start a band with, Invocator began recording again as a one man band in 2007. Finally, in early 2008, Demoniacal Possession released a self-titled demo. During this year, Invocator began developing Demoniacal's sound rapidly without going too far from it's roots. The result was the "Into The Infernal Kingdom" demo, which was released in the beginning of 2009. Also during this year, Demoniacal Possession released a split with the TN/VA based death metal band, Malignant Christ. In 2010, Demoniacal Possession released the "Unholy Triumphant" demo. A full length will be released on Time Before Time Records in 2011. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Demoniacal+Possession">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
