De-Illumination is an Experimental Symphonic Rock/Metal band from Bangladesh, started its journey (2006) on October with a new lineup from some old rockers in the country. Shams [Keys] from Warfaze and Sazzad [Guitars] made their minds to work on something diverse ,meanwhile Samiul [Drums-[artist]Powersurge],Rony [vocals] and Sabbir [Bass-[artist]Kalponik] joined the idea of the experiment. The result was the 1st Symphonic rock/metal appearance in Bangladesh. The name "De-illumination" expresses the intention of rejecting illuminated exterior, full of imposed knowledge and prejudice and be consumed,be the inner light or darkness of one's soul. They released their debut concept album Onibarjo on August 2010 from Deadline Music.
