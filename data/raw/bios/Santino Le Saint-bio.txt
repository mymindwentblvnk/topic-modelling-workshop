Santino Le Saint is the vibrant, young model and artist setting himself apart in the South London music scene. Drawing on in uences across a number of genres, such as RnB, soul, trap, rock and even heavy metal, Le Saint is quickly gaining recognition for his amalgam of unique sounds that challenge any musical preconceptions. While these in uences dating back to childhood are undoubtedly present, each of Le Saint’s songs feels entirely new as his soulful vocals overlay a hazy fusion of synths and well placed guitar solos. What results is a feeling of depth and catharsis nothing short of striking.

Le Saint’s music serves as a portrayal of his experimental ethos and driven personality, which has also led him to explore a number of other creative elds such as design, fashion and lm. As a founding member of music coll- ective Cloud X, Le Saint utilizes this holistic approach to artist management and branding from a collaborative DIY perspective. In an era where industry seems to be propelling us at an exponential pace, leaving little room for exploration and genuine creativity, it is heartening to see a musician such as Le Saint taking an honest approach. NR Magazine sat down with Le Saint to discuss everything from early influences, to his most recent single ‘98’ and a passion for basketball which nearly took him overseas. One thing is clear, Le Saint’s inspired curiosity free from constraints of labels and genres has served him well thus far and will continue to do so in 2018. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Santino+Le+Saint">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
