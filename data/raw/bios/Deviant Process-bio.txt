Deviant Process, formerly Psychic Pain, was founded in 2008 by JD Villeneuve (guitars/lead vocals) in Quebec City, Canada. After having released his self-produced demo, JD managed to get the attention of PL Beaulieu (bass), Stéphane Simard (guitars/back vocal) and Olivier Genest (drums), which led to the creation of Deviant Process in 2009. Collectively, the band decided to move away from Psychic Pain's symphonic style and focus their energies into creating genuinely brutal and original progressive death metal. 

Deviant Process hired Antoine Baril (Symbolic Death Tribute, ex-Augury, ex-Mag Project) to record its first EP entitled “Narcissistic Rage”. It was released in the summer of 2011 and is currently out of print. 

After sharing the stage with death metal icons such as Cryptopsy, Vital Remains and Revocation, Antoine Baril was invited to join Deviant Process, infusing their new material with his jazzy grooves and his solid metal drumming. 

The first full length album was recorded during the summer of 2013 by Antoine at Hemisphere Studio with the help of Chris Donaldson (Cryptopsy, Beneath the Massacre, The Agonist) to setup the monstrous drum miking rig. At mixing stage, Antoine's time being divided between familial, professional and other musical projects decided to leave the band. Francois C. Fortin (Superior Enlightenment, Utlagr, Longing for Dawn) was invited to fill on the drums and also took over the production of the album for reamping, mixing & mastering. 

This new beast is now ready to be released. “Paroxysm", first full lenght album of the band, is a 7 titles record delivering a fusion of death metal brutality and refreshing progressive eclecticsm. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Deviant+Process">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
