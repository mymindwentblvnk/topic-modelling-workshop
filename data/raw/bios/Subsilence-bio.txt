Subsilence was formed in Guildford, England, at the end of 2007. The band initially contained Steve on lead guitar and Martin on vocals, but they chose not to continue with the band and Subsilence is now a four-piece. The current members are Pete Lamport (Vocals, replaced Martin), Ed Cornish (Guitar), Ana Lynn-Smith (Bass), and Richard 'Bertie' Hartley (Drums). The idea for the band originated with Ed, who is strongly influenced by Doom/Stoner bands such as Candlemass, Orange Goblin, Electric Wizard etcetera, however all members of the band contribute to the creative process and their songs are not typical of this genre.

They have played a number of gigs in the local area, and are planning to play further afield. A Demo/EP is also in the works. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Subsilence">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
