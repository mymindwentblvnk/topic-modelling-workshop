German progressive metal band formed in 1988.  Released one EP Infinity and one full length Kadath Decoded, the latter a concept album based on H.P Lovecraft's novella The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath.  They are currently split-up.  Music is heavy on keyboards, acoustics, and some flute passages but is definitely metal.

1995's Kadath Decoded credits the following: Daniel Herrmann (Drums, Percussion & Noise Guitar), Tomek Turek (Piano & Synthies), Hagen Schmidt (Voices), Martin Mannhardt (Bass), Haluk Balikci (Voices), Jan Schröder (Guitars & Flute), and finally Sascha & Sascha of Destiny Dreaming (additional voices).  The cover art is actually a fold out poster designed by Michael Bähre titled "Dreamquest for the Unknown Lovecraft". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Payne%27s+Gray">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
