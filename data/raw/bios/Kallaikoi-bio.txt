Kallaikoi are a Portuguese Metal band, whose range of styles covers all from Black, Heavy and Death Metal, with a strong pagan influence. Formed in the Summer of 2007 by João Ferraz (guitars), André Tavares (drums) and Miguel Campos (vocals), the band rehearsed for some time and started composing songs. When Miguel left the band, João Seco was brought in as his replacement in late 2008, and early 2009 saw the arrival of Luís Nabais, also on guitars. Manuel Alves finally completed the line-up later in June, and as of August, Kallaikoi are getting ready to record their first demo at a professional studio, and setting up dates for touring the country.

Kallaikoi is the greek name for a celtic tribe who lived in the Iberian Peninsula, in what is now northern Portugal and Galicia. They later mixed with the Lusitanians and united as a single people, until the war of conquest (and later liberation) with the Romans. According to the band, the name was chosen to reflect both the lyrical content of ancient battles, pagan philosophy and freedom, and the ancient history of their own country <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kallaikoi">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
