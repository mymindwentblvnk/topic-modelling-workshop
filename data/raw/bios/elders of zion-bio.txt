The Elders of Zion are a post-rock duo consisting of Vance Galloway (guitars, processing) and Joel Schalit (arrangements, percussion, processing). The group is split between Seattle, Washington and Berlin, Germany. Dawn Refuses to Rise (2002, Incidental Music) is their first full-length. 

Their second release, Twilight War, a 35 minute EP was issued in the Fall of 2006, and is available exclusively through Sounds From the Roof/iTunes. 

In 2009, the Elders' first new release in three years, "Basra Memorial Orchestra" appeared on the What's the Sound of the War on the Poor, Vol. IV compilation, curated by Ultra-Red, on Public Records. The band is currently working on a third full-length LP after an extended hiatus. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Elders+Of+Zion">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
