Two bands merged in March 2004: thrash metal Bloodspawn from Piaseczno (Poland) and unnamed death-thrashers from Warsaw. After few line-up changes the band became known as Blade of Terror. The first life performance took place on 30 November 2004 in Warsaw. Then they begun touring around Warsaw. Blade of Terror performed with bands like: Vermin (Netherlands), Insurrection Down (Brasil), Morda (Belgium) and Polish acts: Sceptic, Pandemonium, Hedfirst, Face of Reality, Vedonist, Pyorrhoea.

Currently, Blade’s style is a loud mixture o thrash and death metal with a lot of other heavy influences. In the middle of 2007, Thomas C., Boletz, Flisak, Urded and Grabb recorded ‘The Harvest Has Begun’ demo CD. In September they played the first show abroad (Czech Republic).

In January 2008 Urded left the band and Volsky became the new bass player. In April 2008 the band played its first tour around Poland 'Tour to Perdition 2008'. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Blade+Of+Terror">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
