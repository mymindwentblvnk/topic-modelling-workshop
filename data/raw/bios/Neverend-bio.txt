NEVEREND may refer to:
1. Finnish metalheads NEVEREND: 
band was founded in Heinola, Finland, in the fall of 2002. The idea of getting together to have fun, hang around and most of all play some metal interested us. These factors are the basic elements which will always be the vital to the continuation of the band.

Aggressive rhythm metal would be close to truth in the description of their style. It hasn’t changed a lot since the beginning, maybe a bit to heavier and more melodic direction.

2. Slovenian Alternative Punk Rock Ska band NEVEREND from Goriška, Slovenia.
They released their first album Nothing Is Complete in 2014. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Neverend">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
