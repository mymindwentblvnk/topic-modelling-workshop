Exhorder is an American thrash/groove metal band from New Orleans, Louisiana. They are credited as the purveyors of the groove-oriented thrash sound later made famous by bands such as Pantera, White Zombie, and Machine Head. Initially active from 1985 to 1992, they have since reformed in 2008.

Exhorder was formed in 1985 in New Orleans, Louisiana. After releasing several demos in the vein of pure thrash metal, they started to adapt more of a groove metal-oriented sound with their debut studio album, Slaughter in the Vatican, released in 1990. This sound was further developed by their second (and to date last) album, The Law, released in 1992. The band dissolved later that year.

Exhorder are often credited with having created the groove-oriented thrash metal sound that was copied and popularized by Pantera. The band is either more or less indifferent to such sentiment as they were friends with Pantera and were saddened by the passing of Dimebag Darrell. However, they do not deny the possibility of them having influenced Pantera's sound even though Kyle Thomas has stated Pantera deserves the praise they receive as he feels Pantera have always worked much harder than Exhorder ever did at being successful.
