Black Adder is Finnish rockband formed in 2009. Hard rockin' music with big choruses and fast solos. Just to inform: Black Adder(the band) has nothing to do with the TV-show Blackadder(perceive the space between the words). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Black+Adder">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
