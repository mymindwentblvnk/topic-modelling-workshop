There are two artists known as The Red King.

1) The Red King, or Red King, is a musical entity formed by Johann Bran Cleereman.

Description:
The name is derived from the alchemical process that results in the pheonix stage of the great work, and is often considered the ultimate contribution of an artist or scientist. Currently, there are two albums produced by this one-man project. The first release is Vitreolum, which is based a 7th century alchemical treatise. The 2nd album Is Somniferum, which deals with Papaver somniferum. Vitreolum was released by Dark Symphonies in 2006, while Somniferum was released on Sonic Abyss in 2006. This musician is particularly known for elaborate live performances that employ many different styles and performance artists. Originally from Chimicum, Wa., The Red King moved around the country and as of 2007 resides in Portland Oregon. Related projects include the US based Corvus Corax.

2) The Red King was an indie rock band based out of Philadelphia, PA.  They disbanded in 2004 and left a collection of 14 songs on their webpage which could be downloaded for free.  The webpage was removed from the internet sometime in 2004-2005.  Files of the 14 songs left behind on the website still exist, and in addition, there are still EP CDs floating around from when The Red King would play live shows.  Their sound ranges from that of Bush, to Queens of the Stoneage, to Pink Floyd, to Arab Strap, and even to that of The Black Angels. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Red+King">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
