Unorthodox, unrelenting and utterly unpredictable, St. Louis quartet Vampire Mooose may well be the meanest musical beast you ever encounter. It certainly will be one of the most unique.

Fusing death metal brutality and raw hardcore intensity with abstract, progressive arrangements and jazz-like instrumental dexterity, Mooose sounds something like the progeny of an insane cross-breeding of Meshuggah, Dillinger Escape Plan and Obituary - only weirder and more vicious.
