synchronic was founded in 2001 by drummer philipp and guitarist michael in frankfurt am main, germany. focusing on songwriting, the two were reinforced by Alex (guitar) and gilli (bass) in 2002. still without a vocalist, they recorded their first demo, entitled 'version 1.0', in august 2003 and did the vocal part by themselves.
in may 2004 alex left the band, but only one month later oliver took the vacant job as the lead singer and christoph joined the band on the second guitar. after a couple of live gigs gilli unfortnately moved to another city and had to quit the band.
in march 2006 the line-up was again completed by bassist dominik.
