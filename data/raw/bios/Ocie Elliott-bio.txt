Ocie Elliott is a musical duo comprised of Jon Middleton and Sierra Lundy from Victoria, B.C., Canada. The two met on Salt Spring Island in the summer of 2012 and started singing together three years later.

In late October 2017, they released their first EP to the world, recorded in the woods of Vancouver Island, and immediately attracted an international following. Since then, theyâ€™ve toured Europe and the western United States and opened shows for the likes of Mason Jennings, Sons of the East, Current Swell, Roo Panes, Kim Churchill, Luca Fogale and Joshua Hyslop. 

Ocie Elliott's first album, 'We Fall In', was released through indie giant Nettwerk Music Group on February 8, 2019. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ocie+Elliott">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
