Aesthetic was formed in the middle of 2003 with different members (some of which have moved onto puritan leaving the only original member Mark.) After many line up changes and problems with people in the band Aesthetic settled on their line up of Mark Solomon on guitar, Ryan Williams on guitar, Erik Wilson on bass, and Tristan Burns on drums. They needed a singer and sought out friend Andrew Merwine to do the vocals. A few more line up changes later and you have the current line up of Aesthetic. Mark Solomon on guitar, Ryan Williams on guitar/clean vocals, Mikey Joyce on bass, Jamie Sutor on drums and Andrew Merwine on lead vocals. Due to circumstances that we won't reveal Ryan Williams is out of Aesthetic. Current and final line up is Andrew Merwine on vocals, Mark Solomon on guitars, Mike Joyce on guitars, Jamie Sutor on drums and Adam Barcheski on bass <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Aesthetic">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
