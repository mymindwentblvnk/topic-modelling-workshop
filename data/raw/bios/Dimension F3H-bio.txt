In 2000, Morfeus (from Limbonic Art), started up Dimension F3H to explore his musical visions. Nesmoht (Arch Nemesis) joined on vocals, and after releasing a demo, they got picked up by Hammerheart Records. This lead to the release of the debut album “Reaping The World Winds” in 2003, to critical acclaim.

After that, many things went wrong. Members came and left and the band stood without a deal since Hammerheart Records was put down. Now, Morfeus has recruited a new line-up, he has taken over the vocals, and the band is back on track again. With a more darker, heavy and sinister sound, Dimension F3H signed with Dark Essence Records, and their 2nd album, “Does The Pain Excite You?”, is now ready to be unleashed to the world. 

You’ll have a hard time pin pointing the bands sound. Call it Cyber Metal. Call it futuristic. Just expect some real kickass bladerunner thrash!
