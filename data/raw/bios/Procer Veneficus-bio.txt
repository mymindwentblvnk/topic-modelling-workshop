Procer Veneficus is an ongoing musical experiment initiated by an individual organism on a small terrestrial planet orbiting a class G2 star in the locally-named "Milky Way" galaxy.  This project's purpose is to convert dreams (both waking and sleeping) and an attitude of absolute dedication to the whole of nature throughout the universe into an audio format. This allows the end result to be conveyed to other individual organisms capable of receiving and interpreting such information. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Procer+Veneficus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
