Seattle Washington's Seapony, comprised of Jen Weidl (Vocals, Guitar), Danny Rowland (guitar) & Ian Brewer (Bass). Their first release was the 3-song single Dreaming followed by their debut album, Go With Me (released by Hardly Art) which puts Jen Weidl's youthful melancholia and yearning on display and wraps it in a blanket of twee/surf/jangle pop. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Seapony">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
