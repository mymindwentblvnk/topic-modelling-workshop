There are multiple artists with this name:

1)  Imagine four highly skilled musicians and a killer singer coming together, working on songs for a completely new thing. Imagine further, their musical background reaches from rock over gothic, metal and classical music.

Do you have an idea what it would sound like? Well. let me introduce you to COMA DIVINE, with Sonja Kraushofer on vocals (L‘ÂME IMMORTELLE, PERSEPHONE), Ashley Dayour on guitars (WHISPERS IN THE SHADOW, L‘ÂME IMMORTELLE), Martin Höfert on amplified cello (PERSEPHONE, ex-JANUS), Franz Heinrich Lirsch on bass-guitar (ex-WHISPERS IN THE SHADOW, L‘ÂME IMMORTELLE) and Wolfgang Luckner (L'ÂME IMMORTELLE) on drums. Working together over many years formed the idea of combining their abilities and bias in music which now takes form in an EP they‘ve produced in 2009/2010.
This exquisite line-up provides a strong voice, straight rock combined with classical elements, tasty riffs and a quite healthy hint of madness within the lyrics.

But rather than losing more words to describe what their music sounds like, just sit back and get ready for COMA DIVINE - play at welding volume!


2)  Coma Divine is a dark ambient drone project started in 2001 by C768 and Nox, drummer and keyboard-player of the Italian band Weltschmerz.
