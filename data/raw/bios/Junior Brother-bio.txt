An idiosyncratic, challenging and richly lyrical singer/ songwriter, Junior Brother is the pseudonym of 24 year-old Co. Kerry, Ireland native Ronan Kealy. Fusing elements of Irish and English folk with a deeply unique sensibility, Kealy has steadily built a dedicated fanbase in his current residence of Dublin, further broadening his listenership with each release.

Born outside Killarney, Co. Kerry, Kealy developed a strong love of music from an early age, writing his first song at 9 years old after having taught himself guitar on a banged-up nylon acoustic. A short spell studying English in University College Cork helped Kealy to foster his unique and striking poetic voice, taking his Junior Brother moniker from a character in Jacobean play "The Revenger's Tragedy", a work Kealy studied there.

With the crucial addition of foot tambourine to his musical set-up, Kealy eventually moved to Dublin to briefly study music, before releasing his highly acclaimed second EP "Fuck Off I Love You" in 2016, earning plays and plaudits on such broadcasters as 2fm, Radio Nova, Dublin's 98fm among others. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Junior+Brother">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
