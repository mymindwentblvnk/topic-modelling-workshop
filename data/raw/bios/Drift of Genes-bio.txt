Drift of Genes was started in winter 2008 by young musicians (Spasm and BlackPyramid), wich hadn't almost any expirience in this field.Than some songs were recorded at home, but the fucking quality of these tracks sucked.After some time DG played some concerts. This year (2009) Drift of Genes recorded death/grind album at Beasts Studio and now is working with new material. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Drift+of+Genes">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
