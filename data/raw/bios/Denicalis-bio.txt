Blackened Death Metal from Ostersund, Sweden.

Biography below is taken from their official site www.denicalis.se where you can download their 2008 demo called ...And Angels Brought Carnage and also check out some videos of live performances.

At the summer of 2006 the idea of a Black Metal band was formed. A few weeks later the foundation of the Black/Death Metal band Denicalis was made. 

The founding members of Denicalis is Hugo Nylander, Simon Akerlund and Gustaf Bennmarker, and the same autumn a bassplayer named Mattias Edstrom joined the band.

Their career started at the local stage at the Old Courthouse, where they performed with two other local acts, Embodied Hate and Paincraze. Denicalis is a Black Metal band mostly inspired by the absurd ideologies of christianity and other common religions. The band has stayed active and the results have been a swift rise in the methodical ways of musical expressions.

The years have passed, and we've grown much in our search for the ultimate satisfaction. On our way we've supported bands such as: Sanctification, Aeon, Lamia Antitheus and Evergrey. Not only have this been unvaluable experiences but also a chance of meeting creatures that share our ideologies and purposes. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Denicalis">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
