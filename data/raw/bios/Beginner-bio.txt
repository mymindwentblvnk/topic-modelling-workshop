Beginner (formerly "Absolute Beginner"; in German "Beginner" is singular and plural as well) is the name of a German rap group from Hamburg, consisting of Jan Ei√üfeldt (Jan Delay), Denyo and DJ Mad.

The group was founded as "Absolute Beginner" in 1991, initially with six members: Jan, Denyo, Mardin, DJ Burn, Nabil, Mirko, but the latter three dropped out after a few months. They started rapping in English and German with homemade beats, but later went over to rapping solely in German. During their first public appearance they met DJ Mad, who immediately joined the group. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Beginner">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
