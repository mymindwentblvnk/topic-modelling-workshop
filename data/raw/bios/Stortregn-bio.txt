Stortregn is a Blackened Death Metal band, formed in Switzerland in 2005. After three highly successful albums (Singularity, 2016; Evocation of Light, 2013; Uncreation, 2011), an EP (Devoured By Oblivion, 2008) and an early demo (Stortregn, 2007), they released their latest album, Emptiness Fills the Void, in May 2018.

Initially influenced by the Nordic Black Metal scene, they have expanded their vision and sound into a more contemporary era. With a relentless energy, they deliver a mix of charging riffs, blast beats and brutality that leaves the listener with a lasting impression and begging for more. 

Throughout their career the band has worked with different personalities of the contemporary metal scene, from musicians such as Simon Girard (Beyond Creation), Steffen Kummerer (Obscura, Thulcandra) to painters  Dan Seagrave, Juanjo Castellano and Kristian "Necrolord" WÃ¥hlin and producer Vladimir Cochet (Mirrorthrone, Weeping Birth).

- Romain Negro (vocals)
- Johan Smith (Guitars)
- Duran Bathija (Guitars)
- Manuel Barrios (Bass Guitar) 
- Samuel Jakubec (Drums)
