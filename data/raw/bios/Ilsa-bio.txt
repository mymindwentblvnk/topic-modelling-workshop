Ilsa is a sludge/death metal/crust band from the Washington, DC area, formed in 2008.  Knowledgeable local music fans consider them the heaviest band in the nation's capitol.  They are supposedly named after a Nazi sexplotation movie from the ’70s or something of the sort.  At one point in the past, several members of this band played in Time of the Wolf, a group deemed “Too metal for me” by the punk zine Maximum Rock'n'Roll. It would be facile, but true, to say that Ilsa summons dark forces.

Their lineup includes...

Joshy- drums
Brendan- guitar
Orion- vocals
Tim - guitar
Sharad- bass

Past Members include:

Garrett - guitar
Dominec Romeo (ex-pulling teeth) - guitar

As their influences, they cite: Bolt Thrower, Dismember, Amebix, Entombed, Massacre, Saint Vitus, Isengard, Burning Witch, Deviated Instinct, Asphyx, Pentagram, Roky Erickson
