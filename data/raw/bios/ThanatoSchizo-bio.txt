ThanatoSchizO is a metal group from Santa Marta de Penaguião, Portugal (Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro), founded in late 1997. Practicing a sound associated with progressive death metal, the band makes various incursions through other musical genres such as black metal, doom metal, world music, progressive rock, atmospheric and electronic music, thus being generically included in the avant-garde musical range.

Initially having the name Thanatos, the discography of the group includes four albums (Schizo Level, InsomniousNightLift, Turbulence and Zoom Code), an EP (Melégnia) and a demo. The band has been in many international labels (Rage of Achilles, Divenia Records, Bruning Elf Records, Misdeed Records), which have edited their releases worldwide. In Portugal the group is currently represented by independent label Recital Records.

The collective was considered as the second best Portuguese metal band in LOUD! Magazine’s January 2005 edition, thanks to their third release Turbulence (chosen as the best 2004 record), the subsequent promotional concerts and the members’ strong charisma.

The group signed a contract deal with Italian label My Kingdom Music for the release of the band's fourth album Zoom Code on March, 21, 2008. The album was produced by Luís Barros (Tarantula), mastered by Tommy Newton (Conception, Helloween) and features guest appearances by Timb Harris (Estradasphere, Secret Chiefs 3) and Zweizz (Fleurety, ex-Dødheimsgard).

In March 2009 ThanatoSchizO have inked a deal with Major Label Industries for the release of an semi-acoustic album in 2009. The new record will have reworked songs from all the previous albums, with an even more avant-garde approach and some ethnical and electronic hints. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/ThanatoSchizO">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
