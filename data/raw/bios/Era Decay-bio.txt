The band took birth after 1 year since Colin left the band Shadowsong. All this year he looked for members for the band. First member of the band is the bass player Rares , he got into the band without knowing for sure . And soon after Kelly joined the band . They knew the drummer Codru for a long time but they didn't know that he can really play drums and when their eyes were open they got him in the band. While hanging out in a bar, Rares and Colin met Serban and now he's the vocalist of the band. After their first gig, Kelly got out of the band because of some reason only he knows . Very soon, Nistor (Eisenroth) ,lead guitar and vocalist of Shadowsong, got in the band, without quitting Shadowsong.
