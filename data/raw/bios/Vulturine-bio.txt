Vulturine spreading the Black Metal Pest since 2002 with only one aim: To Make Your Life Worse.

In 2009 Vulturine is:

W (Wlad D Hades)- Hate and Guitars

Daemon Est Deus Invesus – Bass

Khaos 666 – Drums/Fx

FUCK All other past information its useless and meaningless.  

Vulturine is Black Metal against mankind and
represents darkness instead weak human ego scene circus. There’s no need to interact with the crowd and to have “friends” as we are here not to help any movement but to spread the pest. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vulturine">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
