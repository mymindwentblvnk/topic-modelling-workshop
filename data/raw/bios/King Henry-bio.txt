Resident of Los Angeles based beat collective TeamSupreme and member of the Alpha Pup Records family, Henry Allen has only a handful of solo performances under his belt as King Henry.

The New Mexico native gathers influence from Madlib to Jamie xx, giving King Henry a style that is constantly changing to encapsulate the current musical trends, while still maintaining his signature sound. From sample based thrift shop hip hop, to big room sound Top 40 R&B and pop, his inattention to one specific style is what fuels his versatility as a producer.

Pushing past his bad habit of hoarding unreleased music, King Henry plans to release a debut record this year. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/King+Henry">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
