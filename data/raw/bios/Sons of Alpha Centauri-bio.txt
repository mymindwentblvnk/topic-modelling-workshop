‘Sons of Alpha Centauri’ are a dark instrumental riff rock band from Swale, UK. Since conception the band has linked their music to all visual, photographic and historical elements. 

In 2008, the band collaborated with legendary desert instrumentalists ‘Yawning Man’ to form ‘Yawning Sons’. This psychedelic, ambient drone rock trans-Atlantic alliance included guest vocals from members of the Desert Sessions, Kyuss and Queens of the Stone Age. 

The second in the chronology of their collaborative releases featured members of  ‘Karma to Burn’ and the West Virginian incarnation ‘Treasure Cat’.  ‘Last Day of Summer’ was released worldwide on ‘Underdogma Records’ in August 2009. 

In April 2010 Sons of Alpha Centauri released a split vinyl with 'Karma to Burn' on 7" vinyl before beginning the pre-production on their anticipated second album. 

SOAC eluded classification by encapsulating styles from classic rock through to avant-garde metal but also reflect on progressive and psychedelic elements.  This works to create a hypnotic harmonic pulse to form the body of their vast electronic soundscape unique to their epic sound.
