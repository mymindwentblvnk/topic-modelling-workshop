There are two bands named Liquid, and one solo artist who also goes by the moniker 'Liquid':

1) Liquid explosively emerged in 1991 with the seminal anthem 'Sweet Harmony', timelessly layering classic house over rolling, breakneck beats. This was followed by the pioneering and experimental 'Future Music' E.P. which included the dark and atmospheric breakbeat dub classic 'Liquid Is Liquid'. 

Band members were Shane Henegan (DJ Model) and Eamon Downes (Ame) were joined for the first three ep's by producer Jezz Wright

Following Shane Heneghan's departure from the band after the first two releases, the liquid reputation for producing challengingly alternative floorfillers was cemented with 'Time To Get Up' described as a progressive gem and the balearic tinged, flamenco guitars of 'One Love Family' - both of which were mixmag singles of the week.

Liquid have, with top 20 singles in the UK, and european hit singles, achieved huge commercial success while maintaining critical acclaim. the nme describe the XL recordings album 'Liquid Culture' as "sophisticated, soulful techno" and mixmag effuse how it "works beautifully".

Liquid have perfomed live internationally in many countries over many years and after some time away are on the road again.

2) Liquid is also a slovak hard-rock band formed in 2005. This group consists of the members of the band Liquid Boogie Roll and singer Martin Androviƒç. They released their first album "Another Dimension" in 2006.

3) Liquid is also the stage name of R&B/Rap artist Victor Manuel Oquendo, who released his album "Tales from the Badlands" in 2005 off of Gotee records. Oquendo's tribute to the streets of Philly is his only studio album that has been released so far. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Liquid">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
