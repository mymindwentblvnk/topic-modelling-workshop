Formed in 2003 DRAUGGARD (“Domain of the Undead” in Icelandic) appeared to be the first band of the local metal scene to perform raw, fast and evil black metal. Through several releases including “Baldr’s Dreams” single and “Nidgedichte” EP that was consequently released by Swedish label Undead Propaganda, DRAUGGARD have gained the prominent status among local Russian black metal fans. In 2008 DRAUGGARD took part in WACKEN ROAD SHOW in Kiev (UA) and Moscow (RU) sharing the stage with OVERKILL (US), ENSLAVED (NOR), SAMAEL (CHE), DEVILISH IMPRESSIONS (POL) and TRISTANIA (NOR). Soon after, several tours followed including the headlining Ukraine/Russia tour in December 2012 preceded by the tours with CONTRADICTION (GER), DIABOLICAL (SWE), HELLSAW (AUT), NECRONOMICON (GER), NUCLEAR WARFARE (GER) and EPISODE 13 (TUR) not to mention few shows with OMNIUM GATHERUM (FIN). Eventually DRAUGGARD have ultimately performed in almost each more or less big city of the central and Ural part of Russia as well as in Ukraine supporting ONSLAUGHT (UK), in Germany (BIFROST FESTIVAL @ Zeche Carl) and in Belgium (DISTORTION FESTIVAL, main stage). In addition, during their career DRAUGGARD opened for MARDUK (SWE), BELPHEGOR (AUT), ROTTING CHRIST (GRC), RAGNAROK (NOR), ASSASSIN (GER), CATAMENIA (FIN), ALESTORM (UK), OBSCURITY (GER), PANTHEON I (NOR) and many other strong acts. Backed by the local booking agency the band performs regularly live in cities of Russia and Ukraine looking forward to doing as many live shows as they can get. In March 2013 DRAUGGARD release their first full-length album entitled “Da Nobis Tenebras” with Tomasz “Nefastus” Janiszewski (BELPHEGOR, DEBAUCHERY, LYFTHRASYR etc.) on drums. Produced by Oliver Lux, the guitarist and singer of CONTRADICTION (GER) the album features guest appearances of Freddy and Andy, both of German NECRONOMICON, Ilias Papadakis of MEMORAIN as well as of Oliver Lux himself. In June 2013 DRAUGGARD become the first metal band of the local Russian black metal scene to tour Europe headlining shows in Poland, Netherlands and Belgium. Soon after DRAUGGARD enter the studio to record their second effort with Lorenz Lechner (ASMODEUS (AUT), NIGHTFOREST (AUT) etc.) as a permanent drummer.
