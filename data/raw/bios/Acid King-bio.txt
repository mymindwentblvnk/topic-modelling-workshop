Acid King is a stoner doom band that was formed 1993 in San Francisco, USA. Their signature is distortion, tight guitar-bass riff attacks and a Marshall-stacked, bloated low rear end. Ampeg bass amps and Osbourne's Ludwig drum kit supplemented the heaviness accordingly. Heavy but spacey. Lori's searing guitar leads contrasted nicely with her nefarious vocal stylings. People appreciated something different and distinctive, enthusiastically supporting Acid King's opening slots for the likes of the Obsessed, Sleep and Hawkwind.

The band's name was inspired by the book Say You Love Satan by David St. Claire. It is based on the crimes of Ricky Kasso (nicknamed 'The Acid King') who committed a murder in Northport, New York during 1984.

Current Acid King lineup consists of :

Lori S. - guitars, vocals;
Rafael Martinez - bass guitar (Black Cobra);
Joey Osbourne - drums (Altamont).

Former members :

Peter Lucas - bass guitar;
