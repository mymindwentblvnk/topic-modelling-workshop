Languished were formed in 2007 from the remains of 'Sarafice'(White, Campbell and Downey). Drastic changes took place during this time, as the band moved to a heavier style of music, and realised that one guitarist was a major restriction to their live performance, and the addition of a secondary guitarist (Fegan) was a major milestone. 
  The band dived head first into the metal scene, and managed to secure a loyal fanbase, and since this they have been expanding their influence, gaining more and more recognition. This influenced them to record their first CD, 'Burn', in the summer of 2008, which was met with a positive attitude.
  Languished blend influences from Meshuggah, Mastodon, Tool, Lamb Of God, and their own style of writing, focusing on the heavier elements from metal music, and also progressive and melodic styles of lighter artists. New material is in constant production, and the band are looking forward to their next studio experience.

Line up:

Danny White - Vocals/Lead and Rhythm Guitars

Niall 'Wee Boy Son' Fegan - Lead and Rhythm Guitar

Ryan 'Devil Fingers' Campbell - Bass
