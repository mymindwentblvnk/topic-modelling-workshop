Out of the ashes of several hardcore, punk and metalbands, “Darker It gets” was risen in the depths of South West Flanders, Belgium. With our heads in the same direction, we combine a musical style of Thrash Metal, (melodic) Death Metal and Metalcore/Hardcore. As each member has his own influences, the songs are a blend of different interests which results in a unique unity. The combination of two vocalists, each with its own style, take the songs to a higher level. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Darker+It+Gets">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
