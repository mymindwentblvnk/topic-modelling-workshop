Dum Dum Dum were part of the UK DIY Post Punk underground scene of 78 - 81.

Their EP 'Dum Dum Dum' was released in very limited edition hand stamped vinyl on Struck Dum Records - very hard to find - now the track Dum Dum Dum is released on Chuck Warner's Hyped To Death label on Messthetics Greatest Hits.

Members of the band included Paul Conneally, Bill Buchanan, Andy Fulks, Andy Sizer, Tom Green, Martin Cradick - some of whom went on to play with The Orb, Baka Beyond, Another Fine Day, Iguana Brothers...

Almost impossible to get that first EP

In 1980 Dum Dum Dum made recordings (never formally released) with legendary freeform sax player Lol Coxhill - tracks are slowly resurfacing via the net - such as Directive One:
