Raised in Ypsilanti, Michigan, R&B vocalist Queen Naija first became known as a contestant on multiple seasons of American Idol in the early 2010s. Following that, she became famous as an internet personality for her YouTube channel Chris & Queen. On the channel, Naija (also known as Queen Sails) and her husband Chris Sails would post various humorous videos with an emphasis on elaborate pranks.
