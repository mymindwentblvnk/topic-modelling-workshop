3) Absynthe from St-Placide, QC in Canada is an art rock/Alternative rock band using the poetry written by it's lead singer, Dany Baribeau. Other members inlclude Maxime Lambert (Guitars, back vocals), Maxime Lemerise (Guitars), Michael Vinet (Keyboards, Nord Lead), Julien Roche replacing SÃ©bastien Laframboise (Bass, back vocals) and Shane Hatz (Drums, Percussions). They are quite young in the industry but if the right promoter were to fall on them, they could gain the popularity they deserve. The best occasion to appreciate their performance is usually at the St-Jean Baptiste concert in St-Eustache, where Dany reads a few pages of poetry/inspirational thoughts on the position of art and society. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Absynthe">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
