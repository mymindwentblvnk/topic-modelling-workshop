The Iron Horse was a Scottish Celtic music band formed in 1990. Already well established on the traditional music scene, the band first demanded the attention of a broader public through the music they created for the BBC TV documentary series, "The Gamekeeper" (1995). Since its formation in 1990, the band's sound and line-up gradually evolved from acoustic beginnings to a dynamic merging of traditional and contemporary music at its most effective during their live shows capturing the audience with their infectious enthusiasm and vitality. The Iron Horse were Annie Grace (whistles and vocals), Ross Kennedy (guitars and vocals), Gavin Marwick (fiddle), Lynn Morrison (keyboard and vocals), and Rod Paul (whistles, mandolin, banjo, guitar). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Iron+Horse">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
