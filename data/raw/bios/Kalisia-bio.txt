KALISIA is a Progressive Melodic Death Metal band from France, formed in 1994. They released a demo in 1995 called "Skies" described as a the death metal version of Dream Theater. They played a few gigs (Emperor, Samael, My Dying Bride, Therion...) and then started working on an ambitious concept album, "Cybion" consisting of one and only one song that took the band about 8 years of work to fulfill.
