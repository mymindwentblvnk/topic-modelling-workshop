2. Bio for MELTEM - London, UNITED KINGDOM:

Hello wonderful rockers and metalheads out there!

I am a Hard Rock/Metal singer with live, recorded and session work background extending back to the last decade. I mostly work with several different musicians and bands simultaneously recording, gigging and doing mini tours!

I have performed in bands supporting legendary names such as SEBASTIAN BACH (SKID ROW) and ZZ TOP. I have sung headlining the Rock Ozâ€™Arenes (feat. ALICE COOPER, IGGY POP) and Verbier Bike Festivals in Switzerland. I have also had the greatest honour singing a live duet with DORO PESCH, THE QUEEN OF METAL on her Raise Your Fist World Tour, 2012. Having received my blessing from the timeless music goddess, I am currently working on my solo EP with surprise guest appearances.

LOVE and ROCK! \m/
