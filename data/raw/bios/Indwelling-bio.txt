Indwelling was a Christian death metal band formed in 2000 in Chandler, Arizona. It featured Thomas Washington (Vocals/Bass), Jason Stinson (Guitars), Ethan Pajak (Drums), and earlier B.J. Ovsak-Guitar, all ex-members of Christian metalcore outfit Overcome. The band specialized in a sound they described as "more traditional, maybe even old school style of death metal", comparable to Mortification, Death, and early Extol, and showcased lyrics pertaining to devotion to Jesus Christ and salvation. Thomas Washington was also a member of Abashai. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Indwelling">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
