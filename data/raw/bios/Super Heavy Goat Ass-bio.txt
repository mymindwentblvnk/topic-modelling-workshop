Hailing from Austin, Texas; Super Heavy Goat Ass is one of the hardest rocking bands around today.  Their no bullshit balls to the wall style of music really does live up to their band name.  Super, heavy, loud, and very kick ass.
Taking their style from bands such as ZZ Top, Lynyrd Skynyrd, and more modern groups like Southern Gun Culture and Alabama Thunderpussy; Super Heavy Goat Ass is proof positive that rock and roll is alive and well and will never die. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Super+Heavy+Goat+Ass">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
