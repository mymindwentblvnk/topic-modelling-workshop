AND THE GOLDEN CHOIR is Tobias Siebert - A man and his records. Plus a dozen of imagined alter egos. He plays various instruments, records them himself, presses the results on VINYL and plays these records on stage, wonderfully crackling, analogue and instead of a band. 

With this analogue approach, Siebert its somehow behind the times, or beyond it, depending on the perspective. The instrumentally wide-ranging melancholic compositions always find back on their feet in Sieberts unique bittersweet voice which is sometimes reminiscent of Antony And The Johnsons, sometimes of anthem-like feats à la PJ Harvey.

Tobias Siebert works as a Producer for german bands like Me And My Drummer, Phillip Boa, Enno Bunger, Slut and many more.. The well-respected German indie-music magazine Spex once dubbed him “the german Chris Walla“ and called him “indie pope”.   

And The Golden Choir has toured as support for artists like Patti Smith, Calexico, Perfume Genius, James Yorkston, Kante, Slut, Naked Lunch... <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/And+The+Golden+Choir">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
