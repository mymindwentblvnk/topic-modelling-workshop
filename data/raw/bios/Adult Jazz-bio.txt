Adult Jazz are a new British, Leeds based three piece. And rather thoughtlessly, it's not actually jazz. Comprising of multi-instrumentalists, using a variety of arrangements to create rhythmic and interesting pop music. The songs interweave distinctive-vocals, samples and live rhythm with instruments from marimba to trombone. 

Influences come from far and wide, pulling in world, folk and electronic music into their weird pop. Formed by old friends, with various bands under their belts, who wanted to unite and do something that distilled all the things they loved into a ‘coherent’ band.
