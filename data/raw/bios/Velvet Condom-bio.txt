Velvet Condom was formed during 2005, in Strasbourg, France, by Alice Von (vocals, guitars, keyboards) and Oberst Panizza (programming, keyboards). They consider their music as sad pop tunes played by dead mannequins. As if Synthpop would meet dark guitars and teenage angst lyrics. On one side, the cold and safe synthetics of a condom and the glamorous elegance of velvet on the other. 

Their debut EP (8-tracks) was released in 2006, containing minimal electro-wave songs as "Kalter Lippenstift" and "Playgirlz". The band has played several shows in London, Paris, Munich, Athens, Bucharest, Luxemburg, Berlin, Warsaw, Brussels, ... and opened for bands like : Vive la Fete, Who made Who, Fehlfarben, No More, Schwefelgelb, A-Frames, Lesbians on Ecstasy, Jad Wio, Swann Danger, The Weegs, Fliehende Stürme, ... 
On stage, the band definitely shows its wilder and noisier side and would mainly use neon tubes and strobe lights to create a psychedelic robot-noise-pop performance. In the beginning of 2008 VC has moved to Berlin and released their second record "Safe & Elegant", distributed by the Dutch label Enfant Terrible, which got very positive feedback from the press and the audience. “The band has two faces: they play electro pop in the best 80's tradition but with a very contemporary feeling AND they play some of the finest indie guitar pop / shoegazer stuff heard since a long time. In a surprising way these two styles fit together very well and the band ends up with one sound for themselves.” Stay tuned for the dead mannequin’s nouvelle vague.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Velvet+Condom">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
