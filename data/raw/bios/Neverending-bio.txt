Everyone is searching for meaning and purpose in life. The mission of neverending is to share the love of Jesus Christ with all who will listen.

The passion for worship and the surrender of self for the glory of Jesus Christ is easy to see.

"The God who made the world and everything in it is the Lord of heaven and earth and does not live in temples built by hands. And he is not served by human hands, as if he needed anything, because he himself gives all men life and breath and everything else. From one man he made every nation of men, that they should inhabit the whole earth; and he determined the times set for them and the exact places where they should live. God did this so that men would seek him and perhaps reach out for him and find him, though he is not far from each one of us. For in him we live and move and have our being." - Acts 17:24-28 <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Neverending">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
