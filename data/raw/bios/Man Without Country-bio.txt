Man Without Country is a music and multimedia project lead by Ryan James.

Originally formed in 2007 as a duo alongside co-founder Tomas Greenhalf, Man Without Country released two studio albums via Cooperative Music. This allowed the band to tour all over Europe and the US, often supporting the likes of M83, Alt-J, Warpaint and many others.

James has also collaborated with platinum-selling Norwegian electronic music veterans RÖYKSOPP. Their track ‘Sordid Affair’, featuring James’ hypnotic lead vocals was the first single taken from their 2014 studio album ‘The Inevitable End’, which debuted at number one in the iTunes electronic music chart. In June this year, RÖYKSOPP released a re-issue of the physical edition of TIE, which includes an exclusive bonus track titled ‘In The End’, featuring a vocal duet by James and SUSANNE SUNDFØR. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Man+Without+Country">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
