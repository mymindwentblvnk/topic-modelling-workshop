IRON VOID was originally formed by Jonathan ‘Sealey’ Seale & Andy Whittaker (Solstice, The Lamp of Thoth) in 1998 in Wakefield in order to create an old-school Doom Metal band, worshipping at the altar of Doom legends such as Black Sabbath, Saint Vitus, Pentagram, etc. 

Sealey resurrected the band in 2008, with the current line-up consisting of Sealey (Bass & Vocals), Steve Wilson (Guitars & Vocals) & Damien Park (Drums).

To date, Iron Void have released a live demo, 'Live 2008' (2008) and an EP, 'Spell of Ruin' (Doomanoid Records, 2010). This was recently re-released (2012), as an expanded CD edition with 2 bonus tracks and additional photos. The self-titled debut album will be recorded in 2013 with engineer / producer Matt Richardson (Arkham Witch, Bastard of The Skies), to be followed by extensive UK and European tours. 
Live highlights have included a triumphant performance at Malta Doom Metal Festival 2012, tours with Nomad Son, The Prophecy & Mortalicum and numerous shows with the likes of Pagan Altar, Lord Vicar, Witchsorrow, Solstice, The Lamp of Thoth, Leather Nun America, Iron Hearse, Misty Morning, Dark Forest, Asomvel and many more.
