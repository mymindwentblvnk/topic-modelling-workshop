Sun of the Dying started in 2013 as a project by Lavín and Casuso aside of their main groups.
For several months they were shaping the concept and theme until 2015, when the other members join the group: Diego Weser, David Muñoz, CNoir and Iván Sierra.
Once the band was completed, they decided starting the recording of their first work at the end of year: "The roar of the Furious Sea". Before that, CNoir leaved the group and Roberto Rayo join it.
For the following months there was more changes: Adrian MA becomes the new bassist and Eduardo the singer.
Nevertheless, at the end of this year they will release the album and start to play live. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sun+of+The+Dying">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
