Music is magic, there is no better definition for the feeling listeners experience. The only thing that comes close is the role of the magician himself: creating music which puts the audience into complete extasy.
Born in 1987, Style Clash aka Elfsong fell in love with electronic music around the age of 12, and since that there's no escape for him. After several years of listening and deejaying he felt a strong urge to express his creativity in form of  music that he loves so much. That's when the Elfsong project was born.
At first it was just a side-project, a moniker for the more melodic and emotional stuff, but soon it has become clear, that the Elfsong sound is not something to be considered as secondary. With time passing his sound evolved becoming more and more clear with every new production. While releases like "Minutiae", "Sylleptica", "Kaivalya" or the lyrical "Illusions Falling Apart" are just the beginning of a journey into the sound, the direction is clear and wonderful music is yet to be born along the path.
In 2008 a fellow hungarian producer, Aeron Aether did a remix for him, a masterpiece that gave birth to a collaboration between the two, resulting in several original productions and various remixes, all getting heavy support from artists like Matt Darey, Solarstone, John '00' Fleming and Marcus Sch√∂ssow. The guys quickly established themselves as the masters of beautiful melodies and breathtaking soundscapes, and are clearly looking forward a bright future. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Elfsong">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
