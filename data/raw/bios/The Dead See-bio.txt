Originally, Josh Paul (drums), Mark Key (guitar), and Marcos Morales (bass) formed the band Plague of Locusts, but after losing a couple of front men, the band decided it was time for a change in sound and direction. THE DEAD SEE was formed, and Mark took on vocal responsibilities. Shortly thereafter Neil Barrett (guitar, vocals) rounded out the roster. Together this new four-piece line up forged a heavier, grittier and more powerful sound, often drawing comparisons to Mastodon, Neurosis and Crowbar. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Dead+See">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
