Kall - "the Velvet Underground of black 'n' roll" according to Cvlt Nation - have come a long way. The successors of depressive black metal pioneers Lifelover released their self-titled debut in 2014, and while the ghost of their former band floats above three of the members, their second full-length "Brand" (“fire”) is a paean to self-empowerment and rigorous individualism. Using the idioms of Scandinavian black metal, shoe-gazing post rock, saxophone-fueled psychedelia and the saddest of pop, the band gets their message across, breaking the shackles of society and letting go of any preconceived notions. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kall">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
