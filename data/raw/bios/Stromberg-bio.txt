The sound of Stromberg can be described as energetic, subtile blend of Noiserock and Alternative-Rock with catchy melodies and lots of finesse. The band was founded in early 2004. They soon recorded their first 4 song EP at Illingens Twilight studios (RIP). Their first longplayer was recorded in 2005 and released in June '06.
