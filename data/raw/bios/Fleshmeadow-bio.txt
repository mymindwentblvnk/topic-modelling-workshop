The Tech black metal band Fleshmeadow began in 2012 as a collaboration between two friends and former band colleagues who had a vision to make music together. Much of the music was already written before the band started and an EP was planned in 2013. This EP were to be called "UMBRA" but was postponed due to lack of funds and due to personal reasons. 
Now in 2015, Fleshmeadow consists of four members who are working towards recording a full length album this year. The music is a fusion of technical death metal and black metal and the goal is to bring together the better of two worlds. With a fast, technical and atmospheric soundscape, Fleshmeadow will in 2015 emerge out of hibernation and become a part of the Norwegian metal scene.
