Brisbane, Queensland, Australia

Forming via a viral pipeline in 2009, The Schoenberg Automaton comes to life. Rhythmic and surging, an eclectic mix of spasmodic pulses and mechanical grindings coming from the minds of a few hidden within the River City, featuring members of Empyrean, Function Cease, and Cross the Lips of Grace. Saturated in a dark and contemporary noir The Schoenberg Automaton are preparing to unleash what can only be described as a modern, devastating and violent audible assault. They are currently writing their debut full length to be released to the masses very soon, along with an array of energetic live interventions. Be ready, they are coming, the ballast has been altered and soon it will be too late.
