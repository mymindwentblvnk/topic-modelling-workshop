The members of this band have heard the ancient calling of The Order of Steel. They tell the forgotten history of The Order through the ancient and purist form of Metal. The members have gathered in the shadows of the ancient city of Noviomagum to form the Steel Survivors. In secret they are meeting to scheme the reformation of The Order of Steel. Reviving the history of the Masters that once led this earth to its final form.
Wishing to steer away the earth from impending doom the Steel Survivors have started their holy quest to lead the earth back on the right path to take.
