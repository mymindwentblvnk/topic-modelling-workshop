Described by Billboard Magazine as a “visionary composer and producer”, Karsh Kale is one of global music’s brightest stars. In the past 12 years as a solo recording artist, producer, composer, live performer and DJ, Karsh has set the world of electronic fusion on fire and has helped to create a genre of new music and culture that continues to influence an entire generation. His body of work has been cause for fans and critics alike to claim Kale as a pioneer and a trail blazer, not only opening doors for his own career but for an entire scene to emerge in the world of electronica and fusion music. Karsh Kale has also developed a reputation as a genre bending collaborator and a world renowned tabla player and musician, exploring the worlds of electronica, Indian classical music, rock, jazz fusion and hip hop which has led him to work with some of the most renowned artists from around the globe. Kale continues to reinvent his ever-evolving sound and has established himself as one of the worlds most sought after fusion artists.

Born in West Bromwich England and raised in New York by immigrant parents from India, Kale showed his interest in music first as a drummer and eventually as a tabla player (paired classical percussion instrument from north India). Kale grew up steeped in classical music and film music from India; largely due to his father’s own passion for sound. It was Karsh’s father who also introduced him to other styles of music as well such as that of the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. This became a doorway for Kale to begin his own exploration further into the worlds of rock, jazz and eventually, electronica. Bands like Led Zeppelin, Rush, the Police and Pink Floyd along with early hip hop and pop music became some of his earliest and most profound influences. Being a predominantly self-taught musician, Kale was able to break rules at an early age as he began experimenting with different instruments and styles. His own ingenuity and experimental nature helped Kale in developing his “Electric Tabla”. In 2002 Kale was invited to join other pioneering creators of new electronic instruments at the prestigious Lincoln Center where he joined the likes of Robert Moog and Moceanworker to perform the very first all electronic version of Terry Rileys “in C”. Though he has no true guru (teacher) or gharana (school of learning) that he belongs to , Kale , through shear talent has found himself working with the very best from the genre’s in which influenced his sound, from Pt Ravi Shankar to Sting to Zakir Hussain, Herbie Hancock and Bill Laswell to only name a few..

Karsh Kale began his career in music while a student at NYU (New York University) where he studied music production and performance.
He began playing with local bands and was able to showcase his original style as a tabla player and drummer, which led to many recording projects as a session musician. In the mid nineties Kale found himself collaborating and recording with artist such as DJ Spooky, Herbie Hancock, Chaka Khan, Amel Larouix, Bill Laswell and more. His studio savvy and original style keep him in demand to this day as he has recently done sessions for artists such as Lenny Kravitz, Yoko Ono as well as his partners in crime the Midival Punditz. Kale has, as of date, recorded on over 50 releases worldwide as a session musician.

As the 20th century came to a close, Kale found himself inspired and began creating his own solo work which would eventually take form in a highly successful monthly event called Futureproof in NYC. Kale simultaneously created his first self produced E.P called “Classical Science Fiction From India”. A nationwide tour with electronica legend DJ Spooky allowed Kale to spread his sound and also allowed his music to fall into the hands of then upstart record label Six Degrees Records. After the label took notice, curiosity brought them to NY to witness Kale’s Futureproof event. Karsh Kale was immediately signed to a multi album record deal, making him the very first Indo-American to attain a solo record contract in the states. In 2001, Kale released “Realize”, his first solo international release. The album became a milestone for what was dubbed the Asian Massive scene and positioned Kale as the genres leading proponent. The album featured collaborations with the likes of Ustad Sultan Khan, Gigi and some of NYC’s finest musicians. 2 of the songs from “Realize”, “Distance” and “One Step beyond“ are now included in the Microsoft Vista Operating System allowing millions to share in Kale’s music.

In the same year Kale was approached by super producer Bill Laswell to contribute to a project he was calling “Tabla Beat Science”. The album would feature the leading tabla artists who were taking the instrument into modern and exciting new contexts. Kale joined Laswell, Zakir Hussain, Trilok Gurtu and Talvin Singh to create “Tala Matrix” which is considered to be one of the greatest modern explorations of tabla fusion in recent years. The project eventually evolved into a live band featuring Kale on drums and electric tabla, Zakir Hussain on acoustic tabla, Bill Laswell on bass, Ustad Sultan Khan on Sarangi and DJ Disk – turntables. Tabla Beat Science went on to tour the world from their debut at the 16,000 strong Stern Grove concert, which eventually became a 2 disc live release on Palm Pictures. Other stops included Dubai, Beirut, LA, Tokyo , London’s Barbican Center, and finally at the 2nd annual Barsi concert in Mumbai honoring the death anniversary of Hussains famous father Ustad Allah Rakha. Tabla Beat Science also had many guest artists joining their electric live concerts including Pt Hari Prasad Chaurasia, Ganesh Iyer, Salim Merchant (Salim Suleman) and the Midival Punditz.

In 2002 Kale also initiated a tour that would bring together the most promising artists from this evolving genre, which eventually was called the Asian Massive tour. Joined by label mates Midival Punditz and Cheb I Sabbah, the Asian Massive tour proved to be a great success and set sparks that inspired artist from many other U.S cities to follow suit. A compilation of the same name helped to further the scene and establish this sound as an entirely new genre.

Around the time of the release of Broken English, Kale began collaborating with sitar visionary Anoushka Shankar. Their collaboration eventually turned into the 2-year project, which became “Breathing Under Water” released in 2007. For both Kale and Shankar, the collaboration proved to be their most ambitious musical venture to date.

The album also boasted collaborations with Pt Ravi Shankar, Pt Vishwa Mohan Bhatt, Shankar Mahadevan and Sunidhu Chauhan , and was co produced by Gaurav Raina (Midival Punditz) and Salim Merchant.
