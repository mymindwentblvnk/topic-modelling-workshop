Deathevokation was a death metal band from La Jolla, California, USA. They were formed in early 2005 by GÃ¶tz Vogelsang (Guitars/Vocals) (GutRot, SadoCrawl) and Brian Shuff (Guitars) (GutRot). They were later joined by Tushant Bonner (Drums) (GutRot, Civil Unrest) and Steven Nelson (Bass, Winterthrall, Noctuary, Krieg) to complete the "Blood Demo 2005" line up. After those recordings Scott Ellis (Drums) (Warface, To Violently Vomit) took over on drums. They released their debut full-length The Chalice of the Ages in 2007 which was followed-up by two split releases in 2009. Though unknown when it is widely believed that they have split up.
