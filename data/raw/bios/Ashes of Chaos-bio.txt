About
Ashes of Chaos was born as a metal cover band in late 2008. Influenced by the common love for progressive metal, the band's members start writing original songs. As long as they grow up both as musicians and band, they completed their debut album, the concept "Eye". They are inspired by some great names of the progressive metal scene such as Pain of Salvation, Opeth, Tool, Dream Theater, Symphony X, Mastodon, Goblin. They are also influenced by the individual and personal music preferences (funk, jazz, classical music and much more) that can be found in their songs. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ashes+of+Chaos">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
