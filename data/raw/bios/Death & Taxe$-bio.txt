This band was formed "out of the ashes" of NEW WORLD and STRANGE M.F.s. (In fact, "Acid Bath" and "Gone to Join the Circus" were NEW WORLD songs.)

The band themselves referred to their style as "Progressive Jazz Metal Boogie". They claim influences as diverse as Miles Davis, RUSH, Frank Zappa, KING CRIMSON, and YES.

They played throughout the greater Los Angeles club circuit. They also competed at BEATLESFEST in Los Angeles. (They won that competition 3 times, and they eventually went on to cover "Savoy Truffle" in concert for a short period.)

They recorded two CDs and several singles with founding member, Tom Shannon, up until his untimely death in 2002.
