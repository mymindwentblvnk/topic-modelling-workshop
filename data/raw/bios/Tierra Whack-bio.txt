Tierra Whack (born August 11, 1995) is a rap-artist from North Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. As a teenager, she performed as Dizzle Dizz, but reverted back to her birth name in 2017. Her debut album, Whack World, was released on May 30, 2018.

Whack World is a theme park of an album in which Whack sings, raps, and slips in and out of exaggerated voices across 15 songs that, at different moments, might be described as hip-hop, R&B, pop, or country. Every track clocks in at exactly one minute and is accompanied by its own distinctive video. 

While it’s true that this formula is—not accidentally—optimized for Instagram, Whack World is far from a social media stunt. Each song is an economic gem, capturing and tidily packaging one of Whack’s many moods. When watched back-to-back, the visuals connect it all together, guiding the viewer through a bright, surreal universe that has ample room for grief and joy and annoyance and goofiness and self-love.
