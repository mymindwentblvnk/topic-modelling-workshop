Aeons In Torment is a sardinian old school black metal band. It starts as a personal project of its leader and guitarist Emptiness in November 2004. While working on the first tracks of the band his first recruitment was the singer Lord Goat (also Infernal Goat). The will to give this project a concrete form to perform this material with a real band took them to search for other members. Several other involvements kept Emptiness busy for a while, so there was too little time to dedicate to this project till early 2006, when Von joined the band as a bassist. In october 2007 drummer Maliservator finally joined and completed the lineup. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Aeons+In+Torment">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
