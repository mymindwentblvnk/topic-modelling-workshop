Barcelona, Spain (2006 - present)

Retaguardia is a thrash/death metal band hailing from Barcelona, Spain. Whilst recording their first (and so far only) album, called 'La Voz del Silencio' (The Voice of Silence), the band's members were only 16-18 years of age. 

Retaguardia's lyrics often have a nationalist character and critisize present democratic society. For this reason their performances have occasionally attracted controversy among the communities in which their concert would take place.

The music itself can be described as thrash / death metal, with grunt vocals and a lot of guitar solos. Their main influences are Slayer, Dimmu Borgir, Batall√≥n de Castigo, Hatebreed, and many other bands within the hardcore metal genre.

The current line-up is:

Marc - vocals
Liber - guitar
Albert - guitar
Pulpo - drums <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/RETAGUARDIA">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
