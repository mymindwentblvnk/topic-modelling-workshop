The uprising of KhaoZ started at the end of 2008 when members/ex- members from Sinister/Pleurisy/The Embodiment/Houwitser and Dead Head joined forces to create an Old School Death Metal band.

After a few rehearsals in jan. 2009 the band wrote 5 songs. These nr..s contained all were KhaoZ stands for: Heavy Dynamic Death Metal with sickening double vocals. In april the band started with the recordings for their debut mcd ..Twist the knife a little deeper... During those recordings, in the Drum Time and Wings of Death studio..s, the band also did shoot a video clip for the song ..Only to the Worm.. , made by Funeral Productions.

To give the mcd the ultimate killersound they went to Harris Johns (well known from Pestilence, Immolation, Kreator etc) at his Music Lab studio. At this very moment the band is ready with a complete setlist to crush the stages in and near your place. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Khaoz">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
