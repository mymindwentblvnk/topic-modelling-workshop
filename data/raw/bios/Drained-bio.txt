There are several bands called Drained.

1) Drained was a concept created during the demo stages of Circle of Ghosts. A concept that dwelled more on the subject of depression and loneliness during a certain "era" in Inoxia's life. Drained albums were released by Beneath the Fog in 2009, but only considered "test demos" by Circle of Ghosts, and not a part of any official discography. Tracks from the "Drained" demos are featured on official Circle of Ghosts full-length albums released in 2011.

2) Drained started out back in 1996. I wanted to be like Crowbar if the truth be told. But that ended up fueling Drained into a sound, all their own. It was founded by Ty Zembery and the Jason Finley and brother Greg Finley in the small upstate New York town of Owego; only after a few local shows and a few city trips DRAINED started a great support crew. This lead to  opening for national acts like Crowbar, Suffocation, Nile., Biohazard, M.O.D., Hatebreed, Shank 456,, and many other great bands. DRAINED have released 4 albums and 3 EP's over their life time together. DRAINED are as you read this mixing and putting together the final touches on the new albums. Yes 3 new albums coming at you guys. DRAINED has been busy writing and producing better songs than ever before. Newest member Bernie Maxian has been jamming and playing the hell out of his fret-less bass adding a whole new depth to Drained's sound. Also drums by studio pros that I can't legally type here. Watch iTunes for the new albums and EP's. Much love to all the folks who have been waiting so long for the new material. You wonâ€™t be disappointed. DRAINED has mastered the ability to crush your world. ENJOY!!!!! NYSC <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Drained">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
