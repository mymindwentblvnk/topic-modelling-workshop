With each passing year the American Black Metal underground scene grows ever stronger, one such case being the Ohio based Velonnic Sin.  VS originally came into creation in New York back in 2003 as Velinnos' solo project with Kaluer and Infirmity adding session drums and synths.  In 2003 the debut demo 'Daemonized Dreams' was released and a year later paired up with Sin Origin's demo 'Beyond the Cemetery Gates' as a low priced split release.  In 2005 the debut eight track, thirty nine minute album 'Ritual' was released by blackmetal.com records.  Shortly afterwards Velinnos meet up with the guys from Sin Origin and filled in as bassist for their live performances.  Eventually Velinnos moved to Ohio and added their drummer Nemesis Infernum to VS making the band a two piece affair with Velinnos handling guitar, bass, vocals, and lyrics, while Nemesis Infernum played all drums/percussion and backing vocals.  At the end up 2007 the duo produced their sophomore release, 'Ophidious' a forty six minute, eight track release that dealt with the presence of serpents in various cultures and religions.  Recorded at Promethium-147 studios Ophidious turned out to be a vastly superior and mature release compared to Ritual, though as the band ended up self producing and releasing the album few heard it.  In early 2009 the band recorded their third album titled 'Drawing through the Darkling Mirror.'  As of now the album remains unreleased as the band is searching for a label, but the album has been uploaded and can be heard on last.fm.  You'll find that DttDM has characteristics of black metal both old and new with large bursts of speed, melodic touches, depressive dirges, and even ominous atmospheric parts, this new sixty one minute opus is not one to be missed.     <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Velonnic+Sin">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
