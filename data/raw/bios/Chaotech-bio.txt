Chaotech was founded in 2004 under a different name. The final line-up was formed alongside with the new name in 2007, and the band went into the studio to record their first demo in fall 2007. Jasmin (keys) left the band in spring 2010 due to not having enough time to commit to the band.

The new demo, €xi$t, was finished in November 2010. The process of making this album was entirely in the hands of the band, to make it sound exactly like what the band is about.

The demo can be found here:
