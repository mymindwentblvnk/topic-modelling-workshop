There are at leas 3 bands sharing the name Strike Back.

1) Strike Back (Screamo / Russia, Ufa)
The band was formed by summer of 2006. The structure of band, as well as repertoir, constantly varied. Before "Strike Back" Bolshoy and Travis played in band "Something About You". Then them have joined Tima and Isk (both from "Brom%Brigade"). It was necessary to find the bass player because originally Travis should be only the vocalist. There were problems with search of the bass player. And then Isk (guitar) has decided to stop to play in "Strike Back". All this very much braked progress of band. As a result there is the present structure of a band, but because each participant has other projects, debut has occured only later one and a half year from the moment of formation of band. Now Tima (drums) and Travis (bass/vox) play in "Brom%Brigade", and Bolshoy (guitar) in "The Bride Of Changes" and "Villains United".
