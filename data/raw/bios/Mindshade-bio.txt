MindShade is a band that plays 'female fronted metal'. Although with a vocal combination of mezzo soprano and grunts quickly placed into the 'gothic genre', MindShade plays its own variated style of rock, metal with a little bit of gothic. With a heavy sound and melancholic lyrics MindShade truly creates a shadow in your thoughts...

In 2007 Norbert and Jeroen met each other at a jam session with drummer Ron. Things went really well and soon after guitarist Marco was invited to join. After a few sessions MindShade was formed as a band. First thing on the agenda was to find a good male or female vocalist. Drummer Ron however, could not cope with the progress and left the band. Auditions followed and soon after drummer Bart and vocalist Nienke joined MindShade.

February 2008 MindShade performed live for the first time ever during Norbert his birthday in StarSound Studio in Utrecht, The Netherlands and more gigs in Utrecht and Haarlem followed. In November they opened a show for A New Dawn in The Escape in Veenendaal.

After this show it was time to hit the studio to record the first MindShade demo. Bart however left the band to focus on other activities, so the fourremaining members prepared to record the demo. In February 2009 all preparations were completed so MindShade entered the studio. The demo was produced by Andre Borgman (After Forever, Rebelstar). Soon after the recordings were finished more line-up changes were made; drummer Barry joined MindShade but guitarist Marco decided to leave to spend more time with his family.

The first official demo was released September 2009 in a full colour wallet and contains three songs in cd quality (Equilibrium, Don't walk astray, In life or death). It's available in the webshop at MindShade.nl.

At the moment, MindShade is focussing on writing new material and playing live! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mindshade">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
