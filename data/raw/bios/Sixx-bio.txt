Sixx was a short lived gothic/post punk project from the members of highly influential Black Metal band VON. Very similar in style to bands such as early Christian Death, Sisters of Mercy, Voodoo Church and Joy Division, with the production qualities and attitude of VON. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sixx">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
