Reaction initiated by J.A. and L.H. with crude starting materials. M.F. and G.O. joined later on after various technician cancellations. Current product, A Menacing Reality, is raw but favourable. Currently a new product is in development, with more obscene ideas involving monsters.

Current lineup is:

G.O. - Vocals, Synth
L.H. - Guitar, Bass, Vocals
J.A. - Guitar
M.F. - Drums
