Human Atrocity is a instrumental one man project from USA.

The point of focus in the project is fast and flagrantly complex guitar fiendishness from Hockley, both in the form of architectural, nihilisitic, Swedish-style riffing and in organic drumming of massive complexity. Strumming power chords in high-speeding columns of energy, guitars synchronize with bass to communicate multiple rhythms through complex and violent stroke patterns. Rigid precision percussion nails emphatic moments and gives significance to fills, otherwise lost in the speeding alteration of phrases. The project are eminently in the simple wisdom of their phrase construction, the elegance of minimalism, the patterned refractive complexity that gives evidence to their conceptual mastery.

The artist refers to the project as Post-modernist industrial death/grind with influences ranging from Dissection, Bolt Thrower, John Prine, and Dismember.
