The story of Sadistik Forest began in summer 2007 when guitarist Antti Heikkinen (ex-Fall of Man, VIHA), inspired by Possessed comeback shows, decided to put together a band that would perform brutal, relentless and unforgiving Death Metal. 

Text messages were sent to his long time aquintances guitarist Jarkko Lahtinen (Heartburn, ex-Fall of Man), drummer Vesa Mutka (Bjav, Sicknote, ex-Rosemary) and vocalist/bassist Markus Makkonen (Farewell, ex-Entrail Tension Experiment). At this point every beforementioned musician had played metal for over a decade! The band was formed within the same day. Unfortunately Jarkko couldn't find time to continue with the new group, so remaining crew decided to continue as a trio. 

Musicalwise, Sadistik Forest is an interesting combo of Death metal, spiced with influences from Thrash and Black metal. The band embraces the traditions of classic extreme metal and aims only to totally compromise-free artistic outcome. Modern plastic sounds, commercial metal and riffless hyperspeed-assaults couldn't interest Sadistik Forest less. 

Since the days of Black Sabbath extreme metal has been about the riff and that is the sole leading guideline in Sadistik Forests music too! A solid, memorable riff!! In summer 2009 Sadistik Forest recorded a full lenght album, from which the audio takes here are from, and is currently looking for a record label with the same view in music to put that album out.
