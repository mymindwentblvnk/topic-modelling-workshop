MELDRUM is a multi-national hard rock band. In 2005 MELDRUM toured for three months with Zakk Wylde's Black Label Society, appearing in sold out venues across the US and Europe. In the fall of 2005 MELDRUM joined Motorhead as special guests on their 30th anniversary tour throughout Europe. This heavy, hard rock band, fronted by Moa Holmstens mammoth vocal style, combines aggressively melodic vocals, mind bending guitar riffs, along with a rhythm section creating fiercely bombastic grooves, giving MELDRUM their unique, cutting edge sound. Moa Holmsten is special guest vocalist on Motorheads 30th anniversary DVD. Moa recently recorded guest vocals for Lemmy Kilmisters (Motorhead) solo album on a song written by Dave Grohl (Foo Fighters). Guitarist Michelle started her first band Wargod with Strapping Young Lad drummer Gene Hoaglan. She went on to form, and become, lead guitarist of hard rock band "Phantom Blue". "Phantom Blue," was originally signed to Shrapnel Records, Roadrunner, & Geffen Records. The band did a number of several successful worldwide tours. MELDRUM has toured with Motorhead, Zakk Wylde's Black Label Society, Sepultura, Danzig, Nashville Pussy, among others.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Meldrum">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
