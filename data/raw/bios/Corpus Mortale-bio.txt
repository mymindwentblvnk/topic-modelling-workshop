Corpus Mortale plays pure, aggressive death metal and they've done so for two decades.  After 10 years in the underground the band finally release their debut album in November 2003. With Lewd Demeanor was released by Dutch label Neurotic Records. The album was supported by a 20 date European tour along with fellow Danes Konkhra & Illnath. As a teaser for the second album, Greek underground label Nuclear Winter Records released the EP Seize the Moment of Murder  on a 7‚Äù vinyl in late 2006.  A year later A New Species of Deviant saw the light of day (November 2007 in North America through Willowtip Records and February 2008 in Europe through Neurotic Records). In November and December 2009 the band successfully completed an extensive 4 week European tour, performing alongside Nile, Grave, Krisiun and Ulcerate.

In 2010/ 2011 the band has been writing & recording their third album, which marks a new era for the band. The style is now more focused and to the point. Equally important, the band has finally obtained the massive sound that earlier recordings have been lacking. FleshCraft was recorded at Antfarm Studio (The Haunted, Vader, Kataklysm etc.) and StarStruck Studio and finally mixed & mastered by producer and longtime live sound engineer Jacob Olsen at his JBO Sound Studio (Panzerchrist, Crocell etc.)

Present:  2012 has been an eventful year so far... a series of successful shows were executed with it's peak at the infamous Inferno Festival in Norway & a sold-out show at the legendary Pumpehuset in Copenhagen.
Furthermore the band has inked a contract with DeepSend Records for the release of FleshCraft which will be released worldwide at the 8th of January 2013. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Corpus+Mortale">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
