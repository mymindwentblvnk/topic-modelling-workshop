Smith Westerns consists of Cullen Omori (vocals), Max Kakacek (Guitar), Cameron Omori (Bass), and Julien Ehrlich (drums). All members range in age from 21 to 22. Since forming in 2007 in Chicago, Illinois, United States, Smith Westerns have managed to tour both the United States and Europe while supporting the likes of MGMT, Florence and the Machine, Belle and Sebastian, Girls, and Passion Pit. Their self recorded “lo-fi” debut Smith Westerns, released in 2009, garnered critical acclaim for their youthful and glam rock tinged approach to pop music. In 2010, Smith Westerns teamed up with Chris Coady (Yeah Yeah Yeahs, TV on the Radio, Beach House) and current record label Fat Possum to record their sophomore effort in a proper studio. The result was a cleaner/higher quality recording of lush, layered timeless pop songs. The band split up at the end of 2014.

Since then, Max Kakacek and Julian Ehrlich have started a new project, Whitney. sees them teaming up with Touching Voids’ Ziyad Asrar - who also occasionally played keyboards for Smith Westerns. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Smith+Westerns">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
