This sludge band is in a style of their own. Their slowness shames many funeral bands. Their riffs are distorted beyond the hideous in an almost droning way. The vocals sound like a true monstrosity. Bathe this grimness in a despicable and foul anger and you have the general idea of GranG. Those who enjoy ugly and slow doom like Corrupted, Noothgrush and Stabat Mater would be the right circle of people to enjoy this anti-humanity music. The lyrics seems to be mostly in Finnish. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Grang">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
