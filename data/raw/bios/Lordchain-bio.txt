LORDCHAIN was formed by Jeff Grady and Kelly Matthews in 1990,
under the name Eternity. 

During the early 90's the band would perform many concert dates,
record several demo tapes, and place in MTV's Beach House Band Search in 1994.

In 1996 the name was changed to LORDCHAIN, followed by the recording of their first
full-length,self-titled cd that was released the next year. 

Their second full length cd titled "Cracked" was released in 2002 
and the third cd titled"Soulever" came out in 2004. 

After the recording of the "Soulever" album, long time members,
bassist David Fain and guitarist Dale Bassham,left the band.

Filling the void was guitarist Matt Hale and bassist Adam Rhodes. 

With the two new members, the band's fourth cd "Looking Past the Moment" 
was released.

Over the years, styles and situations may have changed but one thing hasn't.... 

LORDCHAIN's commitment to encouraging believers and spreading the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ to the whole world.
