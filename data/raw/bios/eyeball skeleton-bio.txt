Eyeball Skeleton is a Lo-Fi "Kid-Core" rock band from Edgewater, Maryland. The band is made up of 8 year old JJ Brown (guitar, vocals), his 10 year old brother Charlie Brown (bass, vocals) and their father (drums).

The name is a result of the two brothers thinking. JJ thought of "Eyeball" and Charlie thought of "Skeleton" so they combined them.

Charlie described their method for writing lyrics as "We draw pictures and then we come up with names and lyrics about what we draw."

Their debut album, "#1" was released on My Pal God Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Eyeball+Skeleton">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
