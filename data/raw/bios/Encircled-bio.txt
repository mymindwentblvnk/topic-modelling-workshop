1) The story of Encircled roots in September 2003. This quintet, settled in the city of Tilburg [the Netherlands], operates within a wide scale of metal. They represent a solid mix of modern Power Metal and authentic Death- and Heavy Metal elements. The first gig resulted in an award at the 'Kunstbende' competition. Many gigs followed this first success. They launched their motley metal repetoire at the No Sleep Til' Burg Festival in the Choice [013] and opened for bands such as Agresi√≥n and Flesh Made Sin. Encircled released the Icococlast MCD in April 2006. Prepare for iconoclasm!

Unfortunately, despite their enthousiasm, they split up in march 2007 for reasons of different ambitions within the band. Still, everyone hopes to hear more from all the band members in their new projects.
