Continuing from 1:

Earthbound was formed in 1994 by Anders Eriksson, Fredrik Johansson and Carl-Oskar Andreasson. After the first EP "Hypocondric Lovesick EP" in 1996, Andreasson left the group. 

In 1997, Earthbound released a single called "Heartbeat" and in early 1998 they released "Everyone" that became a radio hit in Sweden.

But it was with "Essence of Life" in 1999 that the real breakthrough came. The track was remixed by Skynet UK and John "00" Fleming and was also released in England by Eve Records.

Later in 1999, the release of "One Nation - Trance Nation" became Earthbound's greatest success. The single was then followed by the double-disc album, also called "Earthbound". This album was also nominated for a Swedish "Grammis" Award under the category "Best Modern Dance".

5) "The two artists decided to start Earthbound after bonding over shared politics, tastes in music and fashion, and spiritual practices. Castellon was raised in Berkeley and Oakland; Ariana is from Inglewood. Both are queer femmes who listened to punk growing up. They're also both painters and performance artists. And their shared passion for social justice and indigenous spiritual practices — such as the Nigerian Yoruba faith and Latin American Santería — brought them even closer."
