Although founded as a Pagan/Black Metal Band, Frigoris steadily developed further since its foundation around head Dominik Winter in 2007 and stands for atmospheric, melodic Black Metal at the highest level today. The new record Wind is the current peak of this development. The over fifty minute piece is filled with a surpassing emotional intensity that creates a bond between pure aggression and deep melancholy.

This atmosphere is also brought to the stage. After some member exchanges a solid line-up was found in early 2011 that is able to catch the intensity of the songs perfectly and so fascinate every listener that can get into the atmosphere. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Frigoris">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
