Madrid, Spain (1991 - present)

Estirpe Imperial is a heavy metal band from Madrid, Spain. It was formed in 1991 and released four full-length albums:

Herederos de una Historia (1995)
Himnos de Gloria (1996)
Seguimos Vivos (2000)
Sin Miedo (2007)

Main lyrical themes include strong nationalism and history, playing an essential part in the band's reputation (and notority). Their early music can best be described as simple metal, but from the Seguimos Vivos album and onwards their music turned to heavy metal/epic rock, partly due to the heavily improved production value.

The band's latest release is Sin Miedo from 2007. Estirpe Imperial now often performs live on various occasions, both in Spain and abroad. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Estirpe+Imperial">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
