Band formed by users of a Brazilian mIRC channel.
Eddy and HELLio both lived on Maxwell Street, Rio de Janeiro, and decided to pay an homage to their street. They were also big fans of the work of Charles Bronson. The gory movie series ``Death Wish`` was their biggest concept inspiration. That´s were the band´s name came from: Maxwell (from their street) and Murderers (from Charles Bronson). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Maxwell+Murderers">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
