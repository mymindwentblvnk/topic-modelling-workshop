Patecabra was a Chilean black/thrash/speed metal band formed in 2004 by Lujuria Morbida (Felipe Serra). Though in the studio it was a one-man project, Lujuria Morbida was joined by three session musicians when performing live. Extremely raw and primitive, Patecabra was signed to Barbarian Wrath for the release of just one album, El Horror (limited to 666 hand numbered copies), and has now folded. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Patecabra">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
