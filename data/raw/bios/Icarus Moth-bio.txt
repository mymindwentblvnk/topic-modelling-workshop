Icarus Moth is the sonic project of American electronic music producer, pianist, and sound engineer Nathan Miller.

Born in Denver, CO and based in Brooklyn, NY, Miller's own work has spanned a formidable career, recording and touring with some of the most prominent independent acts such as  MEMBA, Mothica, and Ehiorobo, in addition to work for Atlantic Records, Mercedes Benz, Geberit, UMG, and others.

His work under Icarus Moth blossomed in late 2016 with the release of a remix of alt-Js Breezeblocks, which received more than 600,000 streams on Soundcloud, drawing the attention of national artists and ushering in the upstart of a large collaborative project under Icarus Moth, which has now garnered 10 million plays on Spotify alone.  â€”  https://www.icarusmoth.com/ <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Icarus+Moth">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
