The Symmetric Disorder project was born in 2002 from the wish of five young Italian guys to create a band able to merge the typical Death Metal sound with several influences coming from various musical genres. From the beginning, the band plays intensely live; this live activity strengthens the mutual understanding of the members and makes the band quite known in the underground. Thanks to the suggestions and the experience of the producer Giuseppe Morazzoni, in July 2004 Symmetric Disorder decide to spread a promotional CD containing three songs extracted from the full-length album Biomechanical Nonsense Connections. This promo has been forwarded to magazines and international webzines, obtaining many positive reviews and enthusiastic opinions. In april 2006 the band signed a contact with Deadsun Records, that will promote and distribute "Biomechanical Nonsense Connections" worldwide <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Symmetric+Disorder">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
