Twelve is a solo project of Chris Olley, lead singer and guitarist of the Nottingham, UK rock band Six By Seven.

Twelve's songs are more heavily electronic than most of Six By Seven's, and are stylistically varied, including both guitar and electronics driven songs and elaborate textures along side more straightforwards songs. Olley has described Twelve as an "experiment".

During Six By Seven's 2005-2006 breakup, Twelve was Olley's primary project, though in 2006 he also launched an electroclash project called fuck me USA.

Olley has released two albums as Twelve so far, First Album in 2003 and Be Careful What You Don't Wish For in 2006, with a third, 03, set for release in 2007.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Twelve">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
