Slow Dakota is the only currently-active musical project of Indiana-native PJ Sauerteig. Raised a classical pianist, Sauerteig helped form the campus band, Jeffers Win (named after a close friend), his first year at New York's Columbia University (Fall 2011). The summer after his freshman year, after a failed volunteering trip to South India, Sauerteig wrote, produced, and recorded Slow Dakota's first album, "Our Indian Boy" in his parents home in Ft. Wayne, Indiana. He currently resides in Manhattan, where he studies Creative Writing and Psychology at Columbia University, periodically playing shows and appearing in video projects for Slow Dakota. Slow Dakota's second LP, "BÃ¼rstner and the Baby" was released in September of 2013.

The album, "Our Indian Boy" examines Sauerteig's experiences in India, as well as his relationship with Christianity (some of Sauerteig's paternal family claims involvement in the Lutheran clergy). Sauerteig played most of the instruments, but called in local friends to help sing, play trumpet, and read over lyrics. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Slow+Dakota">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
