HARD TIME was founded at the end of 1991 by four guys who already paid they dues playing in local bands. The kind of music they play critics most often call heavy rock. Band immediately started playing gigs all over Croatia and Slovenia, and earned themselves a record deal. Before first album was released they shoot two video clips, and one of them got on MTV's - "Headbanger ball". So Hard Time became the only Croatian band who ever appeared on this premiere hard rock show.

First record "Kiss my ass and go to hell" (Dea Music) was out in 1993, and all the lyrics were in English. Placed highly on radio and TV charts, record has four singles - video clips. That year HARD TIME was voted best band of the year by the readers of "Metal World" magazine. Constant touring highlights with being on the headliners of the biggest Croatian heavy metal festival "Metal-mania", and three succesfful tours in France covered by French national TV, Fun radio and the press. After few line up changes second album "Kad poludim.." (Croatia Records) was released in 1996. This time lyrics are on Croatian (alternatively they recorded in English) because of domestic market. Album had four singles, which topped national charts.

What HARD TIME is doing best is playing live, so constant touring followed.

Their newest album is entitled 'No. 3', being their third album, published in 2006. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hard+Time">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
