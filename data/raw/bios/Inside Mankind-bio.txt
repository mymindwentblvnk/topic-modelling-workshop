Inside Mankind are a Christian Metal Group from Arezzo, Tuscany.

On April, 27th 2007 they performed for the first time in front of many entusiasthic listeners, playing songs from Iron Maiden, Stratovarious and two songs of their own.

Their call has always been telling everyone the joy of being Cristians, so month after month they started to play only their own song.

After a radical change [the new voice is Gioia Giommoni] the first Demo has been released on January 2009, and can be downloaded from their MySpace Page.

A few hundred copies of the domo has been printed for sales, and the whole income is devolved in charity. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Inside+Mankind">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
