Label head, DJ and producer Andres Klein, aka aUtOdiDakT, eats genres for breakfast. As a DJ he serves the freshest food on the turntables: Electro, New Rave, Indietronics, Bassline and Dubstep. As a producer & label owner he's even more unpredictable... and has done a massive work with Traktor Records, having worked with and released names such Proxy, GTRONIC, Hostage, Malente, Tom Deluxx and Gooseflesh, just to name a few.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Autodidakt">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
