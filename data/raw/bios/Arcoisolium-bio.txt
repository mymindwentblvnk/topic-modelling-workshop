So, our name is Arcoisolium and it means "Tomb in the catacombs" in translation. We play melodic death metal. We serve in town called Vr√°ble. Our band was founded at the start of the March in year 2009. In these times, members of the band have considered in name of the band, style of logo etc. We met at one school, so the prospects for common playing were more than favorably for us. And therefore we are playing until nowadays, we still enjoy it and we also will. We try to play on gigs wherever it is possible. We have also recently released album called Hand Of Help.
