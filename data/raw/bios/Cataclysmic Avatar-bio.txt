An Extreme Gothic Metal band from the USA, formed in 2004. The band is one of only a few which actually play Extreme Gothic Metal (which is still a different sub-genre from the Gothic Black Metal one). Their music and vocals show a strong Cradle of Filth influence. Before splitting up in June 2006, they released one demo album in 2005. The band is no longer active. 

Releases:
2005 - Rapture, Lust and Darker Days - a 4 track demo, which is quite rare even in the US. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cataclysmic+Avatar">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
