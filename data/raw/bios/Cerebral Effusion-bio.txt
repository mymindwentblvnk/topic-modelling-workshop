Cerebral Effusion, a band coming from Spain, started back in 1997 when 4 guys gathered up to compose some brutal death metal. Quickly they started composing new tracks and working hard on their first effort on the underground scene. Just a year later, October 1998, "Immortal Cemetery" came out, 1000 copies were printed, and the whole album was self produced and edited. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cerebral+Effusion">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
