Michael Schenker's Temple of Rock features legendary German guitarist Michael Schenker alongside vocalist Doogie White, guitarist/keyboardist Wayne Findlay, bassist Francis Buchholz and drummer Herman Rarebell. 

In 2011 Michael Schenker entered a new phase of his life with his new band “Temple Of Rock”. The band members included Michael Voss (vocals), and Schenker’s trusty band mates Wayne Findlay (guitar, keyboards), Pete Way (bass) and Herman Rarebell (ex-Scorpions) on drums. On the following extended “Temple Of Rock” world tour, Doogie White took over vocal duties and Francis Buchholz (ex-Scorpions) played bass.The chemistry of this band can be heard on the live recording “Temple Of Rock – Live in Europe” (2012).

Recorded by the same line-up, the first studio album by Michael Schenker’s Temple Of Rock is entitled “Bridge The Gap”, and was released in November 2013. The album features 13 hard-hitting, adrenalin fuelled melodic rock’n’roll songs that showcase Schenker’s distinctive and explosive guitar playing, valiantly underpinned by the ferocious rhythm section of Rarebell and Buchholz, marking the first time Schenker, Rarebell and Buchholz appeared on the same album together since Scorpions’ 1979 classic “Lovedrive”. 

The second album "Spirit on a Mission" will be released in March 2015.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Schenker%27s+Temple+of+Rock">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
