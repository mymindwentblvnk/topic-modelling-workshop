Dethrone The Corrupted is a melodic death metal band from Visole, Slovenia. The band was founded in late 2012 by Beno Meglič, Žiga Pristovnik, Janez Sluga, Rok Lorger and Ali Berglez. Their music is expressing their concepts about the world, the system, the mind, the alter ego and the demons that hunt the human soul. Recently they released their EP with 2 songs titled Open Your Mind and Psychological Warfare. But there are many authentic songs residing in their bag of tricks waiting to be released. Their main goal is to record an album as soon as possible. They are currently working hard to finish their other songs and wish to start touring heavily really soon!
