Although Vow of Silence may not be a household name yet, take note because this band has the talent, sound, and work ethic to get there. They are just waiting on the right doors to open up for them. The four piece hard rock band (made up of two sets of brothers: Ryan and Adam Babbitt and Joe and Tony Pometto), started making a name for themselves nine years ago while they were only in high school. They have grown up in the industry and matured into the dynamic hard rock band they are now. Their motives are clear: to entertain and to positively influence all who come in contact with them and their music. Their introspective lyrics communicate their views and experiences in life, faith, love and everything in between. They self-produced their latest album titled “Diary of a Saint” which sounds like it came from the studio of critically acclaimed sound engineer Tom Lord-Alge. Their sound is reminiscent of bands like Underoath, The Red, Killswitch Engage, and Chevelle, to name a few. However, while often being compared with the bands of the hard rock genre, they still have their own unique sound that enables them to market themselves as a breath of fresh air into an industry that has several giant bands with scores of others trying to follow suit.
