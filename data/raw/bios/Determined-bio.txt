"Determined" was found in 2005. Right from the beginning, we decided to combine a high technical level with the pleasure of playing. Therefore we worked ambitiously for the progress of our music and the foundation of our common work was layed very soon. During 2006, the distinct style steadied and became an inciting, sweeping, "in your face"-mixture, which gained more and more musical and stylistic facets. Two won contests proofed us as an efficient live-band as well. The attempt to archive at least a part of that certain something on a CD succeeded with the recordings of a 5-song EP by the appropriate title of "...just to keep you insane" in august and septmeber 2006. We are now securely established in the Karlsruhe's metal scene as a reliable support band for greater acts (Mercenary, One Man Army or Capitan Sun) and as an audience-destroyer on smaller stages together with other regional troublemakers. In summer 2008, the singer/ guitarist David and bass player Benjamin left the band and were now replaced by Jan (guitar), Medusa (bass guitar) and Alfred as a new singer. Tuned down and determined to write new rhythmically complex but diversified and progressive material, we are now ready to kick your asses! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Determined">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
