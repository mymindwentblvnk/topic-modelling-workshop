Maggot Pigs On Tuesday started off as a single man project led by Brooklyn, New York musician David Fix sometime in 2003 but gradually has been making name within the aggro industrial rock scene of New York City, growing as an actual band rather than being single project.  The band itself is actually a Ministry-worship band playing a similar style found on their "The Mind Is A Terrible Thing To Taste" album.  Many times, the music has low pitched guitar tones with drum machines and sound effects predominantly blurring over the guitars and shout-style vocals.
