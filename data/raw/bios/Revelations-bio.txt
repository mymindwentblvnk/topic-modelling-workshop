“Hailing from Brisbane, Australia, Revelations are a six piece Post-Hardcore band who strive to push their musical composition and live performance to new levels, never settling for second best. Varied musical influences have led them to their own unique and maturing sound within the hardcore genre which they have developed using elements of pop as well as some of the heaviest sounds around. As a band, Revelations are passionate about sharing a powerful message through their music and having a positive impact on listeners of all ages.

With two EP’s under their belt, Revelations have performed relentlessly around Queensland playing support slots for both national and international touring artists, as well as headlining events. Revelations are the act to keep an eye on as they are a force to be reckoned with among Australia’s biggest upcoming artists. After well and truly putting their stamp on the local scene, they push forward onto the National and International stage. With a humble attitude and driving commitment, they continue to look forward to the big things that the future holds.
