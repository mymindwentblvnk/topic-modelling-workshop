Suff Daddy grew up in DÃ¼sseldorf (the city of Kraftwerk), listening to the 90ies hip-hop-collection of his older brother. His favourite group back then were Tha Alkaholiks. He caught the beatbug after he moved to Berlin five years ago, inspired by Quasimoto and Jaylib. Suff Daddy started working with MySpace postergirl Kissey Asplund back in 2005, who is also featured on his Beat 45 "Kill Bill". Locally he is hanging out with fellow Berliners Jim Dunloop and Flomega. "Suff" means "drinking heavy" in German and his favourite drinks are Pilsetten and Tanqueray. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Suff+Daddy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
