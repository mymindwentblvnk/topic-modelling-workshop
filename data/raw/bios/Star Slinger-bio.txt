Star Slinger is a Producer, DJ & Writer from the UK. If you’re not familiar – my name is Darren. I’ve been producing music for over half of my life. Since 2010 I have used the Star Slinger alias. I make electronic music that often edges somewhere between the fringes of Hip Hop, Electronic and Dance music.
This project was born from a love of making connections. From the alias down to the songs, to my mixing style – its all based on connections. I used to listen to multiple genres as kid and notice similarities in the melodies of different genres and wonder why someone had not thought to combine them to make something twice as great. It turns out the people who inspired me to make music also made the same types of connections and associations. Kanye West, J Dilla, The Avalanches, Armand Van Helden, Kenny Dope, Brian Eno, Aphex Twin to name a few. I have come to realise that this profound love of connecting styles, meanings, genres, images, associations, etc etc is at the core of what Star Slinger was and is still about.
