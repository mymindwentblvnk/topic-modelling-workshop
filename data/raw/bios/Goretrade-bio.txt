Between 2000 and 2001, GORETRADE begins to get known among the brutal metal scene in Colombia, by playing in a lot of shows and festival. 

Also between those years the band records their first two musicals productions. The first “Split CD” with the Colombian band CARNAL and the second “Split CD” with the Italian band CORPSEFUCKING ART known in the market as ZOMBIECRONOMICON. 

In 2003 the band sign with the European record label DISPLEASED RECORDS becoming one of the few Colombian band with this support, under the same roof with bands like Cryptopsy, Deeds of Flesh, Devourment, Dying Fetus, Necrophagia, Sadus, among others. 

Also in that year GORETRADE travel to New York - USA, to record their 3° studio album entitled RITUAL OF FLESH and to play some gigs in that country. The releasing of RITUAL OF FLESH open a lot of doors, and take the band to play in bigger festivals around Colombia, most of it as headline band. 

In early 2006 GORETRADE unleash their 4° studio full – length named PERCEPTION OF HATE, getting very good reviews from national and international audiences and media specialist. 

The release of PERCEPTION OF HATE leads to a promotional national tour with shows in every main city all around Colombia. 

Ending 2006, the band hit the roads in their south-American tour, expanding this way the promotion of the PERCEPTION OF HATE record, receiving great acceptation from the international audiences. 

In early 2007 GORETRADE is nominated as Best Brutal Death metal band by GUTTURALZINE, a German global internet metal promoter. 

That year GORETRADE is invited to the well known CALIFORNIA DEATH FEST. In Fresno – California – USA, sadly, for delays in the Visa paperwork, they have to miss the event. 

The same year, the band share stage with the Death Metal Giants CANNIBAL CORPSE, opening their show in the city of Quito – Ecuador. Currently GORETRADE is independently producing their 5° studio album “Mistaken Conception”, which will include the single “They Were Ignored” in rotation now here.
