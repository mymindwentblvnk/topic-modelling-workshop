Summer Heart is a Swedish dream pop act and the solo project of singer-songwriter and multi instrumentalist David Alexander. He is best known for his nostalgic lo-fi sound.

Summer Heart was formed in 2011 just after David Alexander returned to Sweden. His first release, Please Stay EP (2011), gained a lot of attention in the blogosphere. It was topping Hype Machine's charts and got positive reviews in newspapers around the world such as The Guardian and The Star.

After his songs were being picked up by several TV and movie production companies, one of Summer Heartâ€™s tracks ended up on NBC TV-series Whitney, which garnered him many listeners outside the blogosphere.
