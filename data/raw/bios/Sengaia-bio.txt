Founded spring 2003 in Tilburg, the Netherlands, 5 piece technical deathcore band SENGAIA took it's time to grow up and mature, exploring the very boundaries of genres and styles, only to try and cross 'em.
SENGAIA represent the new breed of metal to come. Blending the best of metal, fusion and hardcore into an overwhelmingly brutal and technical whole.
From time to time you may find some rest in their fusion/jazz parts, but in the end this brutal maelstrom of punishing heavy music will suck you under. Fusing influences from Cryptopsy, The Dillinger Escape Plan, Candiria, Meshuggah and many more, SENGAIA create a sound not shown to mankind before.
Featuring members from bands like Textures (Vocals) and 37 StabwoundZ (Drums), this band only consists of experienced musicians with refreshing inputs and perspectives. SENGAIA has rapidly grown from an experimental project to a full-grown band, ready to attack and destroy.
In 2005 Sengaia is progressing amongst the ranks of Dutch heavy bands, signing with booking agency Loudnoise and record label Garden of Exile Records, Sengaia unfolds its fangs, ready to bite and never let go again. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sengaia">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
