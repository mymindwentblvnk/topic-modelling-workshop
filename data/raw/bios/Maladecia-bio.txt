Maladecia is a folk metal band from Cuneo, north west Italy, formed in 2009.
Their music tries to mix modern heavy metal music and traditional cultures from their area, including the love for moutain life and people, in fact the name comes from a mountain in the Maritime Alps range. 
Songs are both traditional music covers and original ones, often using typical wind instruments (pifre, accordions, bagpipes) and more conventional ones (guitar, bass, drums) with both clean and screaming vocals and choirs.

Members:
Guitar/Vocals: Maurizio Bottero
Accordions/Vocals: Paolo Brizio
Bagpipes/Vocals: Floriano Brignone
Bass: Daniele Pellegrino
Drums: Marco Baudino
