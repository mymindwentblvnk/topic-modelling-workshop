Their first eponymous album received great critical acclaim upon its release in 1992. The songs are nearly all classic pop tunes tinged with dark overtones. Excellent and intricate guitar playing accompanied by baffling lyrics from which emerge a world of malevolent barbers, lunatics, mercy seats, car crashes, train journeys delivered in upbeat humour.The Mabuses' music is riddled with improbable arrangements, immersed in dark humour,and rife with pop hooks of great impact. A mixture of Monty Python and the Wicker Man, Syd Barrett and Ennio Morricone, Captain Beefheart and the Beach Boys.
The band was also compared to XTC or The Monochrome Set because of its British eccentricity, but their world is much darker. After that, The Mabuses released a 2nd album "The Melbourne Method". It features some of the most melodic and quirky tunes to have pioneered Brit pop. Kim Fahy literally disappeared before its release, and the album's content points to a profusion of clues as to his preoccupations at the time. Less accessible than their first offering, "The Melbourne method" presents a truly unusual approach to guitar playing and melodic sense while retaining a firm grip in pop sensibilities long established during the sixties.There are some real treasures in this much under-rated album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Mabuses">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
