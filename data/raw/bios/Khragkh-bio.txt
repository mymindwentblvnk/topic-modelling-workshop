KHRAGKH - sounds like "krah" and means "collapse" from belarussian language. 
The name of our first LP album "Ersatz" means "surrogate". 
In album conception it means defective substitude of ideas, systems... substitude of life.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Khragkh">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
