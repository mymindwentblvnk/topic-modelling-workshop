Gaussian Curve is a collaboration between Italian ambient pioneer Gigi Masin, Land Of Lightâ€™s Jonny Nash and Marco Sterk (also know as Young Marco).

Each of them established in their own rights, the three musicians from Italy, UK and the Netherlands, came together during a weekend-long recording session in April of 2014. Without preconceived ideas and developed around often purely intuitive improvised jams, the eight tracks on the album "Clouds" are all 'one take' live recordings. With Gigi Masin on Rhodes and piano, Jonny Nash on guitar, melodica, synths and trumpet and Marco Sterk on synths, rhythmic structures and production duties, the three of them succeed in developing a musical language all of their own. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gaussian+Curve">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
