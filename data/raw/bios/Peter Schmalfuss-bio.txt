Peter Schmalfuss (January 13, 1937 - October 23, 2008) was a German classical pianist born in Berlin, Germany. His performing accomplishments included presenting a complete cycle of the Beethoven sonatas on consecutive evenings. At the invitation of the Chopin Society of Warsaw, Poland, of which he was a member, he performed at Chopin’s birth house in Żelazowa Wola, Poland.

In his last year, a hand ailment prevented Schmalfuss from performing and forced him to cancel his scheduled concert appearances. He died in Darmstadt, Germany, where for more than two decades he had served as a faculty member of the Darmstadt Academy of Musical Arts. For his contributions to its cultural life, the city had awarded him a bronze service plaque. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Peter+Schmalfuss">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
