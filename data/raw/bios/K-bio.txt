What do you get when a Russian rocker and an American folk singer get together? You get a duo called K, that's right, K like the letter in the alphabet. You also get a fresh, sexy new sound that Rolling Stone Magazine called pop-rock with a "country-gothic" twist. K is the conception of vocalist duo Alex Gorshenev, frontman for Russian rock super-group Kukryniksy, and American singer Stephanie Starr, who lends her sultry, countryesque vocals to Gorshenev's dark, menacing sensuality. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/K">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
