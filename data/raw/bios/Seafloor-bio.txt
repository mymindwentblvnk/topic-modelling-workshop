Seafloor is a journal project of musician/producer Sylvia Chen. A continuous effort since 2000, the Seafloor style has evolved between drum and bass, down tempo, trip-hop, ambient, pop, and other forms of electronic music - with influences extending beyond those genres. Throughout all works remains an underlying signature - a feeling of melancholy, the voice used as a texture, simple manipulations and often a hint of the theatrical.

Sylvia is also a member of The Long Ranger, a brother/sister electro-pop effort, and Velella Velella, a party evoking dance band armed with vintage analog instruments. Both bands are based in Seattle, WA. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Seafloor">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
