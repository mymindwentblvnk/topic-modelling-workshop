Pierre Garand, better known as Garou, is a Quebec singer born on June 26, 1972 in Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada.

Discovered by Luc Plamondon singing American blues tunes in small Sherbrooke bars, he was drafted by Plamondon to play the role of Quasimodo in his musical Notre-Dame de Paris, making him a star. After the musical, he managed to launch a successful international pop music career in Quebec, France, and many other European countries. His looks and hoarse voice, as well as the virility that he combines with a boyish niceness, brought many to see him as a major modern day sex symbol. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Garou">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
