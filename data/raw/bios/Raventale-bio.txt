Raventale is a Ukrainian black/doom metal project founded in 2005 in Kiev, Ukraine. It was during this period the first demo recordings appeared.  The group was looking for a label to publish its first disc; they did not have to wait very long.  In 2006, they were signed in Russia via Backfire productions and released their first album "На Хрустальных Качелях".  At the same time, they started work on recording new songs, and by 2007 the material was ready for publication.  But given the gap in the collaborative relationship with Backfire production, they had to look for a new label, which delayed the release of their album.  "Давно Ушедших Дней" came out in autumn 2008 from Solitude productions.

In August 2009 they completed work on their third release.  Raventale continued its cooperation with Solitude, and in November 2009, they released "Тленные Стремления" ("Mortal Aspirations").
