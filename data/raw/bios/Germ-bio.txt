There are multiple artists with this name:

1) A project of Australian Tim Yatras (Austere, Grey Waters, ex-Nazxul, etc) that incorporates elements of depressive black metal, rock and electronic music. Germ was conceived in early 2006, and shortly afterward the "Raving Mad With Sadness" song appeared online. Since then Germ has remained out of the public eye, but in the Spring of 2009 he entered SLS Studios to record his debut album. However, the record was not completed until 2011. Germ then followed this up with 2014's Grief, which shied away from the electronic elements of his previous work and brought more focus onto the guitars. Another short album - Loss - appeared later the same year, bringing back some electronic elements in a dreamy mixing pot of styles from his previous works.
Finally his latest album titled Escape appeared in 2016, again building on what he has done before, refining his sound further and cementing himself as one of the essential artists in the rising "Blackgaze" movement, influencing newer Blackgaze bands such as Ghost Bath in the process.

2)  Germ is the experimental techno/idm project of Tim Wright. Previous releases were found on the sought after GPR (General Production Recordings) record label in the early to mid nineties. Also records as Moondog, Pin, Speed Baby, Tube Jerk.

4) Czech postgrunge band from Opava.

5) or Da Germ is a German Underground HipHop Artist from Frankfurt

6) Alternative, grunge, shoegaze band from Birmingham England.
