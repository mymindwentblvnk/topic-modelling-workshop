AT DAWN WE RAGE is a collective started in late 2010 by a talented group of 
friends based out of Phoenix, AZ and Los Angeles, CA. 
 
The ADWR production and live side consist of Stormy Logan (LIGHTSOVERLA) 
and Travis Seekrits (EMERGEINSEA). In a short amount of time they have 
released remix after remix of quality electronica/dubstep, all while currently 
working on a number of originals that will be released via their own label by the 
same name. Taking their live shows to the next level ADWR has added live 
drums and an audio/visual element to their shows setting them apart from the 
normal electronic musician. 
 
With the current amount of hype and a ton of original material on the horizon, 
2011 plans to be a break-out year for ADWR.
