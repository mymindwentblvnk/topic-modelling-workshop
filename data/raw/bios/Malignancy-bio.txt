Malignancy plays very intense, crushing brutal death metal out of Yonkers, NY (US)  since 1992 and are known for their seamless variations between hyper-technical riffing and unsurpassable NYDM style breakdowns.  With each release, Malignancy increases speed, technicality, eccentric intensity and originality. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Malignancy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
