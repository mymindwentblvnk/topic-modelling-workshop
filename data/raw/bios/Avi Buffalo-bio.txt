Avi Buffalo was an alternative rock band from Long Beach, California, headed by songwriter/guitarist Avigdor Zahner-Isenberg. The band signed to Sub Pop Records in late 2009 and released their self-titled debut on April 27th, 2010. On 27 January 2015, Zahner-Isenberg announced via Facebook that he was ceasing the band.

Zahner-Isenberg began writing and recording songs at home on his computer during his 10th grade year in high school, and debuted a full electric band at the beginning of his junior year. The group played a number of local shows in Long Beach before being asked to play in Los Angeles. A year later Zahner-Isenberg began recording songs with Aaron Embry, and these recordings began to form parts of the band's first record.

In 2011 Zahner-Isenberg recorded two songs at home in Long Beach and released another single on Sub Pop titled "How Come/Good I'm Wishing", the band toured in the summer and then came home to write and record towards a second album.

Avi Buffalo's music was a mash-up of many genres, with heavy guitar influence and lyrical ambiguity.
