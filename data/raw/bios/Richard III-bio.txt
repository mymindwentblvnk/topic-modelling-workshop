Could not find much info about Richard III, they where a punk trio from France. Some people will know them from there compilation track “Will You Care?” on Bullshit Detector Three (Crass Records) from 1984. The cassette is a compilation of tracks from 1982 – 1984. Richard III was released on cassette by V.I.S.A / Rebel Flux (none, N° 004) in 1986. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Richard+III">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
