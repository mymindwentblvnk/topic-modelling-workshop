HORMONY CORRUPTION was born in 1998 as a pure hormonal trio, Von Bertík-(guitar), Borovicka(drums), Vdolec(vocal). Shortly after that, Vdolec was exchanged by Pretty Pantera. After the Immortal Shadows 3, the guitarist Luboš(from Bad Comedy) and the bass guitarist Žabák (from Endorfin) joined the group. Their first debut song in year 2000 was called Hormonal Massacre. After publishing their CD Válka je vul(War is ox) the group was hit by a personal earthquake. Luboš and Borovicka left for Adultery and Žabák left for Virtual Void. HORMONY CORRUPTION was joined by Monty (drums) this year and group started working on a new material called Galerie bolesti( The Gallery of pain).You can even hear five years old Janette Von Bertik on one of the songs from new album.
