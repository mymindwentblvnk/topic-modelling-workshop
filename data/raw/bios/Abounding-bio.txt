Formed around June 2013, Abounding played it's first show in December 2013 under the name Ridge. Recording for the Abounding's self titled debut album began in February 2014 and ended in September of the same year. The album was released October 3, 2014. All recording was done by Seth Stanfield (acoustic/electric guitars, bass, vocals, keys, programming) and Evan Sandy (drums, keys, programming.)

Abounding plays music that combines elements of progressive black metal with other forms of extreme metal. The music utilizes complex song structures and chord progressions with each song varying in primary style and techniques being used. Subject content of the lyrics ranges from the analyzing and questioning of specific ideas concerning an individual's place amongst his or her peers/environment to general dissatisfaction with various social standards. Some songs are hugely metaphorical and open to interpretation (see "Freely, Still I Roam" and "Amidst The Lunar Stain").
