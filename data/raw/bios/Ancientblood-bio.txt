Ancientblood was an old school black metal project from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, formed by Lord Mantus in 2001.

Heavily influenced by the Scandinavian scene, he recorded "The Profane Hymns of the Sovereign Darkness" in 2002, released on tape back then and reissued in 2007 on MCD.

Also contributed with two tracks, "Drenched by the Unholy Blood" and "For Satan Himself" to the "Split Of Darkness" release with Ankrismah, Accursed and The One in 2004.

In 2007, when there was an opportunity to become a real band along with other members and because people were associating the name to a racist connotation and there was some bands with a similar name, they decided to change name to Vinterthron. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ancientblood">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
