Past: Quite a delirium all the way...

Future: We'll see... There's lots of unrecorded material so hope to enter the studio soon... We also greed for more gigs and rehearse more than ever. One important goal is to gain more live experience and due to that we hope to get some name in the metal underground and a regular fanbase. Patience is the way to go. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Drown+Me+Blue">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
