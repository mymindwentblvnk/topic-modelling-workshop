Rising from surabaya, Indonesia since 2005 titikkoma means dot and coma, it's about our interpretation of death some people believe that death like a dot, death is the end of life but the rest believe that death like coma it's just a door to another life, we have released our first album "RECODE THE REVELATION" in 2008 through Premature records.. between 2010 - 2011.. we will release our first album in U.K and Korea through Realize records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Titik+Koma">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
