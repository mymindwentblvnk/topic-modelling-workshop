IAMDISEASE is a Slovenian band playing dark and angry hardcore with strong influences of metal, crust and sludge. Their music deals with the darker sides of human nature and the monstrosities of the information society. However, their message is not surrender and despair, but hope in changes for the better of everyone. 

The reason why Iamdisease isn’t celebrating the 20th year anniversary is not because they are a young, undiscovered forerunners of an emerging scene. Iamdisease is a band which saw the beginnings, lived through and ultimately managed to outlive the last 20 years of alternative music scene. Rooted in the hardcore scenes of Slovenian cities Nova Gorica and Ajdovščina from the second half of the 90’s, the band maintains the true faith in the power of music as a medium, which relaxes the body and stimulates mental activities. Today, music for the most part bacame just a colorful backdrop for the production and reproduction of the capitalist system. Iamdisease strongly believe that music should cut down and break the linearity of the prevailing social framework.

Iamdisease is a four-piece consisting of vocalist Marko Rusjan, guitarist Ivo Lozej, bassist Jan T. Černic and drummer Tomaž Ušaj, each of them more than familiar from their earlier activities on the local music scene as the members of acts such as Man In The Shadow, Low Punch, The Hoax Program, Elodea, Kennyball Smith and A Murder Theory. Drawing personal influences from such a variety of bands, Iamdisease blended its own mixture of dark and angry hardcore with prominent excursions into metal, crust and sludge, with lyrics that deal with the darker side of human nature and the monstrosities of today’s information society. So far, the band has relased a demo in 2010 and a self-titled debut album in 2012, both on the local DIY label Storm Inside Records, run by band’s guitar player.

Now, with the latest release entitled »Praznina« (Void), Iamdisease continued where they left off with their previous album. The tradition of metallized hardcore of the early 90’s is here further extended and combined with Black Flag’s proto-sludge and the hybrid application of various extreme metal subgenres, predominantly black and death metal. Clocking just under 25 minutes, these 7 new tracks offer a consistent execution of fast-paced rhythms, jangly, dark guitar riffs with discordant melodic passages and precise bass lines under a rasp, angry vocal that delivers engaged messages to the listener. Lyrically, a good portion of the album relies on philosophical motives, mostly found in the works of Friedrich Nietzsche (emptiness, void, eternal recurrence of the same), and other related, introspective subjects expanded with a social note. However, the communiqué here is not of surrender or despair, but of hope in change for the better. Although the language used is the band’s native Slovenian, the booklet gives explanations in English for everyone to understand the feelings behind the lyrics. All in all, the resulting recording is an interesting blend of sounds that is nowadays found in less than a few local bands, and a welcoming addition to a progressing hardcore.
