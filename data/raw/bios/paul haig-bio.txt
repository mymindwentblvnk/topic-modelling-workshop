Paul Haig is a Scottish indie composer, musician and singer. He was originally a member of a 1980s post-punk band called Josef K who were assigned to the Postcard record label. Other bands with Postcard at the same time were Orange Juice, Aztec Camera and the Go-Betweens.

Josef K (who have since become 'one of the most influential bands in Britain' -The Guardian) recorded five singles and an album 'The Only Fun in Town' with Haig on lead vocals, before splitting after touring in July and August 1981; their final Scottish date was in Glasgow. 

There has been a resurgence of activity over the last couple of years from RoL. In 2007, Haig's first single for 14 years, Reason (a BBC Radio 2 single of the week, no less), was released, available via download and 7" vinyl. Followed soon after by Electronik Audience. This album showcased Paul's influences from Kraftwerk and New Order to Cabaret Voltaire. 

2007 also saw the first live appearance from Paul in many years when he appeared at the Billy Mackenzie tribute concert in London. Yet another new album, 'Go Out Tonight', a more organic album than 'Electronik Audience', was released in April 2008. Go Out Tonight saw Paul return to his roots and tracks such as Trouble Maker are very reminiscent of early solo recordings. Haig also embarked on his first tour since 1989 when he promoted both old and new tracks in Scotland and selected dates in Nottingham and London in April 2008. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Paul+Haig">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
