Solstickan tried to make some music one day, he failed, but he did atleast try, so it ended up with a full album with a bonustrack, a single with a song and a mix, and then a new album followeb by the newly released Den Radioaktiva BÃ¤vern.

The genre is something like very strange music mixed with an extreme oddity, it's wierd, but that's what Solstickan tried to achieve, plain wierd sound, not a serious kind of music.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Solstickan">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
