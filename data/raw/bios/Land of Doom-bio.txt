Land of Doom was traditional doom metal band formed in late 2007 in Silver Spring, Maryland,USA by vocalist/bassist Dee Calhoun & guitarist Russ Strahan, with a vision to create a band based around good songwriting skills rather than virtuoso musicianship. Dee and Russ agree that virtuosity has its place, however they wanted their music to appeal to more than just fellow musicians.

After several sessions together, the songwriting duo made the decision to add local veteran drummer Mikey Phillips to the fold. A few jams together proved that chemistry, communication and mutual respect were present in the lineup. The band then decided on the k.i.s.s. (keep it simple, stupid) concept and opted to stay a power trio.

Influences:
Pentagram, Black Sabbath, Down, The Obsessed, Unorthodox, Trouble, Spirit Caravan, and many many others...

They released one self titled EP in 2008.

Land Of Doom disbanded in early 2009 as Russ joined Pentagram and Dee returned to After Therapy.
