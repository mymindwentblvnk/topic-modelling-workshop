Sometimes it takes some time until a collaboration finally comes to life, and this band is one such example. POSTHUMANBIGBANG is the headwork and brainchild of two brothers - the result is a concept album on the fatality and fate of mankind, offering a very own mix of contemporary progressive music: throwing hardcore-heavy riffs, growls, clean vocals, accoustic mellow moments and electronic elements into a big blender and putting the bits back together.
