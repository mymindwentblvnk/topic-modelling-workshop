Should play melodic, minimal pop that touches on postrock and shoegaze. They have sketched both the noisy and the sedate in a handful of releases since 1995.  Band members are M. Ostermeier, Tanya Maus, and Eric Ostermeier.

The trio originated in Austin, Texas, writing, recording, and performing under the name shiFt. Their debut six song CD-EP on Austin's ND label, 1995's A Folding Sieve, was a product of the 1990's American shoegazer scene. 

After a 7" on ND in 1997, Words On Music released Should's first full length CD, Feed Like Fishes, in late 1998. Falling somewhere between shoegazer, indie, and postrock, the album garnered comparisons to Yo La Tengo, Slowdive, Galaxie 500, and Brian Eno.

In 2002 Words On Music re-released A Folding Sieve, doubling the number of tracks of the original EP. Added to the original seven songs are both tracks from a 1997 7" single that featured a version of Jean Paul Sartre Experience's "Own Two Feet," a cover of 18th Dye's "Merger," and four unreleased songs recorded in 1995 and 1996.

In December 2010 Should finished recording their third album, Like a Fire Without Sound, which was released in April 2011 on Words On Music.

In November 2011, Captured Tracks kicked off its Shoegaze Archive series with a reissue of A Folding Sieve â€“ both on vinyl and CD. The reissue is different than the 2002 edition on Words On Music. This edition is an essentially complete collection of songs recorded in Austin from 1992-1995 and, as such, contains several previously unreleased tracks. 

The beginning of 2014 saw the release of a new album, The Great Pretend, which was preceded by the three-song digital single, Down A Notch.
