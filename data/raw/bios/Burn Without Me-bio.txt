Burn Without Me are a new extreme instrumental metal band from Westborough, MA, combining extreme metal with odd atmospheric synths and voice samples.

Describing their sound is difficult. Imagine Agoraphobic Nosebleed or Pig Destroyer if they were recorded and produced by Bill Laswell or Brian Eno. No genre is to be left out of their music, or discriminated against. Combining a Latin street groove with a furious and violent burst of blast beats is a possibility. Of a soft, ambient synth interrupted by odd voice-over samples and jazz bebop drums can also happen.

Burn Without Me are:
Sydney Byron: Bass guitar, effects
Kurt Allan: Drums, samples, synths
Seth Tracy: Guitars, synths, programming

Former member:
Everett Jordan: Synths, guitars, programming, samples

They are currently in the process of completing the recording their second album in their home studio, Blister Studios, with more creative assistance from Dimaension X.

Burn Without Me are not afraid to experiment or challenge the boundaries of "metal."
