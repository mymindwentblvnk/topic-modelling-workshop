Winter Storm are a Five piece Dark Melodic Metal band hailing from the West Midlands, United Kingdom. 

Winter Storm began in 2008 with a vision of Hannah and Wayne’s to create a female fronted band like no other.

Winter storm would be heavy, atmospheric, whilst still retaining traits of that Gothic Metal sound, but providing a more Melodic Metal edge.

During 2009 Winter Storm performed alongside Delain and Sirenia as a part of the Femme Metal Festival weekend, playing the Asylum in Birmingham.

But it was in 2010 that things really started to take off. From opening for Delain at JBs Dudley as part of their UK tour, to playing alongside To-Mera, Kells, Die So Fluid, Orestea and The Birthday Massacre later this month at Birmingham’s 02 Academy.

 Winter Storm’s debut album was released November 2010, entitled ‘Serenity In Darkness’ and features ten tracks, such as fan favourites ‘The Embrace’, ‘Prison Cell’ and ‘Internal Storm’.
