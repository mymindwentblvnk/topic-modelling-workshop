There have been at least two bands named Grand Theft.

Grand Theft is a Belgian singer-songwriter, AKA Michel van Montfort.
He is assisted by musicians who played with dEUS, Sioen & Flip Kowlier.

The earlier Grand Theft was a satirical hard rock band from Mercer Island, Washington. They were actually a straight-ahead folkrock outfit called Bluebird, but they also released a self-pressed LP in 1972 under the name Grand Theft. The original album is highly sought-after by collectors, and it was reissued twice in the 1990s: first under the title "It's Eating Me Alive", and later retitled "Hiking To Eternity" (with two extra cuts from their unfinished second LP). The music was intended as a goof on hard rock bands of the day such as Grand Funk (one of their best known tunes, "Closer To Herfy's", is a direct satire of GFR's "Closer To Home") and the lyrics are often quite funny even today. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Grand+Theft">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
