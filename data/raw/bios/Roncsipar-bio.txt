Roncsipar is a hungarian band, which translates as "Wreck Industry". Originally from Budapest, they play one branch of experimental industrial metal, with some groove metal and jazzy / funky touches at times, heavy drum machines and electronic experimentalism. They describe themselves as "monolithic / industrial rock'n'roll". Roncsipar's sound remembers Godflesh, old Pitchshifter, obscure 90's experimental death metal bands and some heavy electronics artists.
