Like A Stuntman are four people from in and around Hamburg. They are strange but friendly people who make some queer electronic indie-rock noises. They are rather good at what they do, and make us smile with their quirky melodies, off-kilter rhythms, funny dances, and on-stage banter. They sing and play musical instruments like guitars and drums, and one of them also likes to play live electronics with lots of varied keyboards and even a portable computer system.
