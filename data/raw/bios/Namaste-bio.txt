1. Paris, France
It all started with a trip to India which inspired Raphael Cornet (guitar/vocals) and Kenzo Zurzolo to actualize their dreams and follow the musical footsteps of Ray Charles, The Roots, and Finley Quaye. Soon after, Octavio Angarita (cello), Benoit Dordolo (bass), and Reda Samba (drums) joined the Parisian formation. Namast√©; a consciously playful fusion of rock, reggae, and jazz, aligned with lyrical elements of hip-hop and soul melodies, introduces a dynamic, coherent, and altogether innovative and inspired musical ensemble.
