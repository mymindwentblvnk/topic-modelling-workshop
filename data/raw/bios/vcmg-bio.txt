There are two artists named VCMG:

1) VCMG is an electronic music project by Vince Clarke (Erasure, Yazoo, Depeche Mode) and Martin L. Gore (Depeche Mode).

VCMG is the fruit of initially tentative discussion and subsequent enthused collaboration where Vince and Martin, both influential as pioneers in electronic music, get to exercise their lifelong love of the genre as the techno inspired VCMG.

The writing and recording of the album was done in a typically unique way with the pair working alone in their respective studios, communicating only via email, exchanging files until the album was ready. It was in May 2011 that the pair met for the first time to discuss the project when they both performed at Short Circuit presents Mute festival in London.

The first release is an EP entitled EP1 / SPOCK, which will be available initially as a global exclusive on Beatport on 30 November, and then on all DSPs from 12 December with the 12" release following on 19 December 2011.

The album SSSS was released in 2012. It was produced by Vince Clarke and Martin L. Gore and mixed by the influential Californian electronic artist Ãœberzone / Q.

2) VCMG is a chiptune musician who releases music on the Pixl-Bot netlabel.
