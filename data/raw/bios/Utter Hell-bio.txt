Utter Hell was formed in late '99 then named Penumbra, by Armhand War and Shaitan, with the purpose to do an infernal and devastating attack. On September of 2001 was recorded independently the “Devastating Horde” EP which was released in '02 by Dahmer Recs. Then in November of that year are presented in the first National Black Fest in Mexico City. Since that time the band goes through lineup changes, forcing the band to rethink the plan of attack. It is then that in '05 was decided to rename the band to leave the past, and back on the road to Hell. Is in the fourth month of '08 when they recorded the album "Celestial Murder" which contains 10 tracks. The lyrics speak of Satanism, Anti-religion, anti-Christian, demonic possession and destruction, covens, the infernal kingdom, that the evil Lord guide us to the dark path and open the seven gates of hell to bring his legions and we wait for the glorious day of the great arrival of the utter hell!!!
