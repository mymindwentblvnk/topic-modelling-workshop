Crimson Rain was originally a side project of Paul and Ryan's from their old band who never made a name. When they disbanded, Crimson Rain became Ryan and Paul's main focus, with Paul as lead guitar and Ryan as rhythm. Gary would annoyingly tag along to their practices, and one day showed off his guttural vocals, thus becoming the vocalist. During practices, Paul could pretty much do the guitar parts alone, and with only one guitar input, Ryan would sit behind the drumset bored. Being a quick learner, Ryan took over drum parts, becoming increasingly better in months. And nine months later, Crimson Rain was born, 300+ pounds and who the fuck knows ounces.

Attempting Cannibal Corpse style riffs, Waking the Cadaver style vocals, and Dying Fetus drumming, Crimson Rain is one of the least known Grind/Metal bands out there. The three piece band resides in the bowels of San Diego next to the border, where shitty scene music such as BMTH and Suicide Silence lives, there is hope. The only three decent metal heads formed a band due to the extreme lack of mosh pits. The band doesn't sound it's best at shows where we have cheap equipment, or in 5$ an hour recording sessions, but in practice in the only place where we can practice, a sports park that has a music room. The band is known mainly for being insanely loud, and a group of assholes who will make fun of literally anything. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Crimson+Rain">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
