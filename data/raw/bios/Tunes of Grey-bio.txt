Tunes of Grey was born in 2004 when Romero Grinerdam invited César Schroeder to play guitars in his band Tundra, which initially played only covers of Iced Earth. With similar musical tastes and ideas, they decided to form a band inspired by two of their major influences: Sentenced and Poisonblack. In the beginning, Romero's friend, the bassist Udayam Bassul, and Lívia Cocco were invited to play bass and keyboards. Several guitarrists passed through Tunes of Grey, all of them being chosen carefully, including Leonardo "Hackin" and Ancelmo Rodrigues, both of them of the doom metal band Evictus. Actually the band counts with Tiago Assis, musical partner of César Schroeder in a long time and Humberto Boldt (Ex-Amprizy) ..boards.

The main instrumentist of the band, the bassist, backing vocalist and composer Denis Coelho brought on his music not only the heaviness and melody of the finnish bands like Charon and To Die For, but also the musical complexity and beauty of bands like Opeth and Evergrey. The sound reached by the vocal lines of Denis found the affinity of the vocal melodies of JP Mephistopheles.

Actually, the band has Carlos Henrique in command of drums and JP Mephistopheles on vocals. Tunes of Grey is now composing new musics to a future Debut album.
