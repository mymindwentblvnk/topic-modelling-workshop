There are several bands using the name.

1. Voight Kampff is a French techno-thrash band from Britanny.  They released their first album, More Human Than Human, in 2012.

2. Voight-Kampff began as Run Down in 2005 when Sulier (MO.) and Swanson-White (MN.) came together due to a shared love of darker moodier punk. After both had been in hardcore bands they decided to try something a little weirder. A 2 song 45 was done after passing songs back and forth and was belatedly released in 2012 on Baltimore’s Firestarter Records. At this point the songs were already written for their debut full-length and the two decided to make a clean break from RD with a name change and stripped down format which would involve only the two of them for recording purposes. VK has played roughly a show a year since 07 recruiting different friends to flesh out live line-ups including Doom Town’s Ashley Hohman and Tom Valli, Bryan Clarkson and Shaun Morrissey from The Humanoids, Matty Coonfield of Bug Chaser and Tone Rodent, Phil Schwarz of Rock Bottom Records, Ted Howard of the 86’ed, and Brad Stiffler of Condominium. The duo is currently at work writing for their second LP and has plans to finally tour and increase their activities. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Voight+Kampff">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
