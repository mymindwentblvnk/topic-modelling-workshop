This band was started sometime in the early 80's.  Jenny Thornburg (Lead guitarist), Mary Jo (Mary the Maniac) Hodges (Bass), Debra (Debbie do-it) Billingsley (Vocals), and Pamela (Bam-Bam) Galloway (Drums). They performed mostly in Southern California doing such places as Madaam Wongs, Troubadour, Jezabels and other venues in the SoCal rock-n-roll circuit.  They played with such bands as Guns-n-Roses, White Lion and many other bands who ran that circuit.  They finally split-up in either the late '80s or early '90s just before they completed their 2nd album.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Diamond+Claw">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
