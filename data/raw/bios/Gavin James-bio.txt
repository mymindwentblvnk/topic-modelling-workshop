Gavin James (born Gavin Wigglesworth on 5 July 1991) is an Irish singer-songwriter. In March 2013 and March 2016, he won the Choice Music Prize Irish Song of the Year award.

James won Ireland's answer to the Mercury (the Choice Music Prize for 'Song of the Year') and saw his debut EP ('Say Hello') remain on the Irish chart for over 6 months. This rise and development in his home market has gained James sell-out headline dates and wider support tours with the likes of Lianne La Havas, Beth Orton, Kodaline and Marina & The Diamonds. 

A snapshot of this ascent, 'Live at Whelans' is a selection of new and old songs performed in the stripped-back environment of a rapturously-received hometown show. The first track to be lifted from it, 'Nervous', is a pin-drop account of a one-sided relationship: from that initial fear of your first meeting to the gradual realisation, by the end of the song, that perhaps they were never who you thought they were (and it's best to forget about them).

James released his eagerly-anticipated debut album, ‘Bitter Pill’ on March 11th 2016 – having already gone Top 5, been certified Platinum and winner of Choice Music Prize’s ‘Song of the Year’ in his native Ireland in 2013 and 2016. Following a sold-out London show at KOKO, support across Spotify (Spotlight Artists for 2016), Radio 1, Virgin Radio, Beats 1 and Radio X, Gavin had an extensive UK tour, European tour, US tour and Australian dates, that featured Shepherd’s Bush Empire on October 7th 2016 in London and 3Arena on December 2016 in Dublin. Gavin has over 150 million total streams on Spotify already and live performances on Late Late Show with James Corden, Jimmy Kimmel Live, BBC One Show and C’est A Vous. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gavin+James">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
