Sleeping Prophet is the solo project of Patrick Simonds (SleepingProphet), in Portland, Oregon, USA. While generally classifiable as darkwave, the music borrows significantly from industrial and gothic genres with lyrics mixing the personal and abstract themes, particularly focusing on dreams and solitude. 

The project began in the summer of 1999, and is still active today, having produced over 40 tracks, including some "top ten" breaks on the mp3.com industrial charts back in the early 2000s. Sleeping Prophet currently remains unsigned to any label.

Completed albums include "The Birth EP" (1999), "The Alpha Sessions" (2000), "The Broken Mirror Anthology" (parts 1 and 2, 2001), "Introspection's Child" (2003), and "Connectivity" (2006), most of which can be freely obtained from the official website.

The name "Sleeping Prophet" was chosen with no relation to the book regarding Edgar Cayce, and is meant to represent the reflective origins of the music from reactions to personal experiences, yet with some manner of irreparable imperfection inherent to its form.
