Satanus started his Solo project in 2005 because he couldn't find musicians to found a band. 
So he decided to create and record his noise on his own. 
Since 2005 Satanus recorded 5 demo cds which where only spread among friends. 
The experience he made by this recordings was very important for the following cds. 
All demos had been recorded at home with his computer with a cheap recording programm. Vocals, 
lyrics, guitars and drum programming created himself. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Satanus">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
