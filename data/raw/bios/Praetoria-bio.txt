Praetoria started in February 2009 with Michaël Rodrigues and Jonathan Davenport (Guitar and Drums). 
It took a few months before they found the exact style they wanted to play in.
The band found his place in a mix between Thrash Metal for the impact and Death Metal for the violence.

They quickly got joined by Pierre Klementieff on guitar, and after a few gigs with different musicians, finally managed to make up the final line-up with Alexandre Lopes at vocals and Nicholas « Tama » Stacpoole on bass.

Since then, the band works on his songs with fierceness and is getting its debut EP out April, 11th 2011.
