In a sea of postmodern hipsters come bedroom producers on a sparkling lilo of talent. Russ Chimes is a man from the UK who knows what's in the party. Sounding a bit like something halfway between a Sega game and an airbrushed mural of Wayfarer'd flamingos, Russ Chimes' tunes may at times elicit some degree of nostalgia, although the inherent quality definitely proves he's more about doing what feels good rather than the irony (in a manner perhaps akin to funk fanatics Chromeo).

Russ (a 25 year old producer from London) also heads up the British wing of French west coast retro-futuristic collective Valerie, and blends some seriously catchy 80's synth hooks with some really impressive layering and lush composition, all topped with a groove that can keep you dancing until the sun comes up over the beach front palm trees.

Russ has come to receive some significant blog attention for his own tracks and has already knocked out stellar remixes for the likes of Sam Sparro, Chromeo and The Millioners. With an E.P and new remixes in the pipeline he is definitely one to watch this year.

So if you're in that kind of Miami-neon sort of mood then head over to Russ's myspace page, as She's Got The Heat is what you need playing out of your drop top Ferrari 328. Seriously.
