The Nijmegen/Amsterdam based producer knows how to incorporate musical influences from all over the world. The love for organic music has always been running through in his blood. The young Djordje Petrovic already explored the Jazz, Afrobeat, Balkan and World Music. 
For Satori it was never a matter of experiment. Raised by a Serbian father and a South African mother and his sister, a singer-song writer, as his first musical teacher, it was only logical that the Balkan- , Afrobeats- and Indie-influences, would forever nest themselves in his musical DNA. First there was the African music, again a sound that got played a lot in the Petrovic household. It resulted in the young Satori to teach himself how to play guitar at the age of 12. He started experimenting with melodies, when he was 18 he also taught himself how to play piano. Without any experience within bands or any musical training, he composed his first songs on his own.

2) Late 2000s founded California, USA based act providing a fresh mix of reggae, blue-beat, rock-steady and ska. SATORI sounds like they could be straight from the streets of Kingston Jamaica, but instead they are from Seal Beach/SF Bay Area CA. This project is the brainchild of Steve Borth (RX BANDITS, LINK 80), and features all the members of the RX BANDITS, plus guest spots by CHRIS MURRAY and members of THE EXIT. Inspired by Stevie Wonder, King Tubby, Lee "Skratch" Perry and Duke Ellington.
