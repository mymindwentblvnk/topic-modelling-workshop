Leannan Shee is a Brazilian Celtic folk band formed in the winter of 2006 in the city of São Paulo. It's unique sound fuses the music of Ireland, Scotland, Britanny and Celtic Iberia with the Brazilian drumming traditions and with a taste of rock that is not commonly heard of these days. The band is: César Castro-Rosa (poet, lead vocals, tin whistle, mandolin, guitars), Pablo Piola (guitars, backing vocals), Lúcia Fernandes (percussion, backing vocals) and Ivann Cavalhero (bodhrán, backing vocals). Leannan Shee has released its first album named Leannan Shee in the winter of 2007. Along with traditional tunes and songs, the album also shows three original pieces written by Castro-Rosa. The name of the band is a corruption of the phonetic Gaelic Lianhaun Sidhe, which is a fairy spirit that haunts poets. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Leannan+Shee">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
