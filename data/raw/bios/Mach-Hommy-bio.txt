Mach-Hommy is a Haitian-American rapper from Newark, New Jersey. He has drawn attention for the high prices he charges for his work (between US$300 and $3000), as well as his anonymity and reclusiveness.

While he does produce solo material, he works closely and extensively with Tha God Fahim heavily using the moniker "Dump Gawd". Hommy is credited as executive producer on Fahim's "TGIF" project from 2016, among others, aswell as more recently Your Old Droog's 2019 album "Jewelry".

In 2016 he self-released the album "HBO (Haitian Body Odor)" on CD and vinyl (via direct message only), later releasing it on streaming. The album was released in conjunction with Griselda Records.

After splitting with Griselda, the Dump Gawd collective was formed and in 2017 Mach released 9 projects alone (10 including compilations). Quite the feat, yes, but Fahim's "dumping" was even more prolific.

"Tuez-Les Tous" (translated to "Kill Them All") was released in 2019 and was fully produced by DJ Muggs of Cypress Hill. In an interview with Complex Muggs described Mach as "one of the greatest talents to ever walk the earth".

In late 2020, Mach would regroup with Griselda Records and release "Pray For Haiti": an album executive produced by Westside Gunn in 2021.

Other artists he has collaborated with include Earl Sweatshirt, Armand Hammer, Hus Kingpin, Your Old Droog, Westside Gunn, Quelle Chris, Knxwledge, The Alchemist, and Evidence.
