Heintje (Official name Hein Simons) started very young with his career. Introduced by Vader Abraham to the Dutch audience, he became an instant hit with the Dutch audience as well as the people in Belgium, Germany and several other European nations.
As child artist he was charming and soon many other child artists like Wilma followed in his footsteps.
He is still singing, but now with his 'adult' name Hein Simons. Schlager music is still his main signature. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Heintje">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
