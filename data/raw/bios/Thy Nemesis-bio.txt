Thy Nemesis (2002 - 2006) was a black metal band founded in the winter of 2002 by Christcrusher (vocals, guitars) and Percht (drums and keys) who both played in a strange black metal band called "Moonlake" for five years and both of them were in contact with CCP since 1998. In the summer of 2002 Christcrusher met Frost from Satyricon and Tjalve from 1349 in Oslo which gave him the final kick to realize his visions and to start Thy Nemesis.

In early 2003, Agrimoth (bass) joined the band and the rehearsals for their first album Forgotten Dreadful Legends began. During the rehearsals Percht got more and more interested in the grindcore scene and left the band. Christcrusher decided to invite Tharon (drums and keys) to come in for Percht, because they both played together in a death metal band called "LEUCOMA" in 1993. The album "Forgotten Dreadful Legends" was released on CCP Records in 2003, the line-up of the album was: Christcrusher (vocals, guitars and lyrics), Tharon (drums and keyboards) and Agrimoth (bass).

The second album "Christcrushing Anthems" was anounced in 2004 and released on CCP Records in 2005. The line-up was: Christcrusher (vocals, guitars and bass) and Tharon (drums and keyboards).

Lyrics from the band were about Forgotten Satanic and Heathen Tales.

The band splitted up in 2006 and in the same year, Christcrusher formed Kirchenbrand. He plays in Kirchenbrand (a raw black metal project) and Sch√§delberg (a more ambient-oriented black metal project). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Thy+Nemesis">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
