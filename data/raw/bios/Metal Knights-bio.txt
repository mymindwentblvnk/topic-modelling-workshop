Based out of Los Angeles California, Metal Knights began their career as a tribute band.  They quickly realized that their talent was meant for something more and they went on to start an original band that holds to heart the true meaning of heavy metal.  Their EP entitled "The Crossing" is an excellent example of why heavy metal will never die.  From start to finish this album is a fist pumping assault on the ears, with songs such as, "The Gates Of Hell" and "Miracle In Disguise", it is no surprise that this band will be a force to reckon with very soon.  The band encompasses all that is heavy metal, with dynamic vocals, great guitar solo's, pounding drums and the majestic keyboard.  The vocals are classic to the trained metal ear, they grab your attention and don't let go until you are screaming along every word.  The guitar work brings powerful riffs to each song and the solo's will leave you mind blown.  The best attribute is the keyboards...the music is already a monster, but the keyboards turn Metal Knights into an epic powerhouse.  Metal Knights have reached a certain amount of fame through radio airwaves and online promotion, but the future seems very bright for this band.  Sticking to true heavy metal, fans will be there with their fists raised for Metal Knights!
