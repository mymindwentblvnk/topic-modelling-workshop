Kataklysm is a Canadian death metal band. They call their musical style "northern hyperblast" after an advertisement in M.E.A.T. magazine describing another band, Fear Factory, as "hyperblast". The term refers to the extremely fast blast beats that Kataklysm's drummer, Max Duhamel, fuses into the music.1992. At the beginning of their career they were mostly known for being one of the fastest, most chaotic metal bands. However, their music changed after Sylvain Houde left the band, and bassist/backing vocalist Maurizio Iacono took over Houde's vocal duties, and another full-time bassist was recruited.

In 1998, the band released "Victims of This Fallen World", an album which was noted as being a change in musical style from previous albums. The following album "The Prophecy (Stigmata of the Immaculate)", however, this saw the band return to its previous style, though less chaotic and with a touch of thrash metal.

Drummer Max Duhamel is said to have been forced out of the band because of injuries. Eventually, Duhamel recovered from his injuries and participated on Kataklysm's ninth album, "In the Arms of Devastation".

Kataklysm's line-up has remained relatively stable compared to many other bands within the metal genre. The band only has one missing original member, Sylvain Houde. Drummers make out most of the band's "former members" list.

Kataklysm is well known for their incorporation of movie-quote samples in their music.
