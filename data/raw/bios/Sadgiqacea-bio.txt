The sludging whirlpools of SADGIQACEA (sad-juh-kay-sha) are as deep as the oceans and as vast as the cosmos, equally turbulent and serene. Waves of detuned, ambient guitar paint a dripping psychedelic resonance, while cadences of thundering percussion manifest unbridled raw energy. Dark and light elements pummel and writhe, creating a harmonious yet chilling aura. Dueling vocals provide a haunting atmosphere and complete the supernatural essence of the overall sound, drowning the listener in a sea of mystifying turmoil. A very unique listening experience, for fans of: HIGH ON FIRE, TYPE O NEGATIVE, PINK FLOYD, TORCHE, INTRONAUT, MASTODON
