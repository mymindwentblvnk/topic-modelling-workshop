Outputmessage is DC resident Bernard Farley, a singer, producer, and DJ whose style ranges from upbeat electro pop to techno and house. He's a member of Volta Bureau (whose song, "Alley Cat", topped the Beatport indie-dance chart), but has also been churning out tunes on his own since 2003, releasing stand-out tracks and remixes on labels such as Ghostly, Melodic, and his own Output Noise Records. In 2006, he released his first album Nebulae, a set of instrumental songs displaying his knack for catchy melodies and lush synth work. Since then, Farley's honed his "creamy baritone" and released an eclectic array of vocal tracks from the uplifting electro house album Autonomous, to the funky indie and nu-disco of the Game Over EP and most recently, the lush futuristic R&B of the Quantum Love EP. He is currently finishing work on a new album of "space music", which promises to be his most sonically adventurous yet. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Outputmessage">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
