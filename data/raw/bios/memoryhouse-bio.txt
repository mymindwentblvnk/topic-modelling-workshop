Memoryhouse is the recording project of neo-classical composer Evan Abeele and photographer Denise Nouvion from Guelph, Ontario. The name "Memoryhouse" is itself, a tribute to German composer Max Richter's seminal work and the project was originally a means to escape the paralysis of winter. It mixes ambient loops, breezy samples, aquatic guitars, and burbling synths.
