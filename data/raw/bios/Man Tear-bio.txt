Axel Boman and Petter Nordkvist of Sweden’s Studio Barnhus momentarily shine a mirror ball onto their usual punch-drunk house for their debut release as Man Tear. A collaboration with vocalist J. Jonason, “Outside Amore” is a trilling slab of spacious disco, the loping drums and chiming synthesizer accents pirouetting in tandem with Jonason’s tremulous delivery. The yearning vox of the original are kinetic on their own, but the dub further accosts Jonason with all manner of interplanetary commotion and shards of tambourine. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Man+Tear">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
