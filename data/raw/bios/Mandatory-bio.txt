MANDATORY was founded in summer '01 by Sascha (Guitars/Bass) and Stinne (Drums/Vocals) for the love of raw and straightforward Death Metal in the vein of the early 90's. 

Right before the recording sessions to the first MCD "Divine Destruction" (2002) the second guitarist and bass player decided to leave the band so that MANDATORY had been acting as a duo since back then. "Divine Destruction" brought strong reviews in mags and webzines all over the earth.

It was this line-up which also recorded the latest MCD "Curse Of The Undead" (2005) as well as the brand new "...Where They Bleed" in 2006. "Curse Of The Undead" was released to fantastic reviews and support worldwide. "...Where They Bleed" has been released and distributed worldwide by ASPHYXIATE RECORDINGS.

'06 will also see the release of older sold out material plus additional previously unreleased tracks on the "Beyond The Veil"-anthology. A full length release - "In Torment" - is scheduled for early 2007 !!

Freshly reinforced with a new bassist and a second guitarist MANDATORY are currently preparing for future live invasions.

Support the underground and keep on rottin' !!!
