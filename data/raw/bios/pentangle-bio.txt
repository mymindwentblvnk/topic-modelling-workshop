Pentangle, along with Fairport Convention, were one of the shining lights in the modernisation of British folk music in the 1960s. Rather than adding elements of rock music, however, they leaned toward jazz, supplementing twin acoustic guitars with jazzy drums and acoustic bass.

The band consisted of two of the superstars of British folk guitar, Bert Jansch (3rd November 1943 - 5th October 2011) and John Renbourn (both of whom also sang,) singer Jacqui McShee, bassist Danny Thompson and drummer Terry Cox. The original line-up lasted until the early 70s, when a series of ins and outs resulted in erratic output, which continued through the 80s and 90s.

The core of the band's identity was the eclectic virtuosity of Jansch and Renbourn, who added elements of Middle Eastern music, blues, jazz and Classical to their style. At various times, they also experimented with electric guitar and sitar.

In the UK, probably best known for providing 'Light Flight' as the theme to the BBC drama series 'Take Three Girls'. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Pentangle">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
