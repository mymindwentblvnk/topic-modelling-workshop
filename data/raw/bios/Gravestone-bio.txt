Gravestone was a legendary Heavy Metal/Power Metal band formed in Illertissen, Bavaria, Germany in 1977. The band's early period saw them playing drawn out, progressive rock, but in 1980 they changed their sound to more of a straight up heavy metal sound, melodic with the vocals of Berti Majdan, yet fast, taking on many of the characteristic German speed metal elements. The band's debut album was released as early as 1979, on AVC Sudios, with their follow up 'metal' album 'War' coming out the following year, released independently. Arguably, the band's signature sound was evidenced in their third album, The powerful 'Victim of Chains' (1984). Their following two albums continued the energetic, melodic heavy metal approach, sounding somewhat similar to Grim Reaper (UK). in the late 1980's, the band changed names and style, becoming a melodic rock act, as the music scene was becoming inceasingly at the time. They beacme 48 Crash, but this new direction proved unsuccessful.
