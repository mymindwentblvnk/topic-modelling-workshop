FLESHWROUGHT was born in 2003 when death/grind drummer Navene Koperweis, who is best known for playing in the now defunct San Francisco Bay area Deathcore/Technical Death Metal band Animosity, and currently drumming in the instrumental group, Animals As Leaders, paired up with Nic Gauthier and made a demo at their friend’s house. A live lineup formed shortly after the demo was recorded and consisted of Nic, Navene and fellow Animosity band mate Chase Fraser. FLESHWROUGHT played a few local shows in Santa Cruz California (where the band called home), one of which was a New Year’s house party with Decrepit Birth. As time went on, the guys jammed less and less due to Animosity's high frequency tour schedule and Navene moving an hour and a half away to San Francisco. However, Navene’s writing for FLESHWROUGHT never slowed down and in fact his productivity was increasing exponentially as Navene had acquired amazing musical tools such as 7-string guitars, computers, and recording software; all components necessary to make his own album. Johnny Davy from the band Job for a Cowboy now does vocals. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fleshwrought">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
