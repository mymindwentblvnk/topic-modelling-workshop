Hailing from the rugged streets of the South Bronx, Division X has been one of the budding success stories of the New York independent Hip Hop scene. Formed in November of 2001, Division X quickly molded their individual talent into a distinctive high energy affair. Proudly emphasizing an original in your face sound, and a thought provoking rap edge, this three man group consists of lyricists North Star, Mad Dog, and turntablist DR. Dust. With their descriptive, "heart of the Bronx lyrics" and self produced "attack track" soundscapes, Division X is clear on what their music represents. "We make music for the underdog, says North Star. Our music is very hard, and that's because of our surroundings. Simply put, Division X tracks are loud, cannon blast music. We make hard ass beats, and hard ass rhymes, for some hard ass times." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Division+X">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
