There are two artists by this name. 

One is a thrashy grindcore band from New Jersey, US.

The other is an experimental band from the UK, formed by Giles Perring and Nick Cash in 1991, on the Echocity label. "Their music is hallmarked by bravura massed drumming, banshee wails of very electric guitar and soundscapes that drip with connotations of spies, religion and insomniac obsession". Unmen (UK) released 2 albums: "Love under Water" (1992 - Some Bizzare) and "Music in Motion" (1995 - Handlebar records/Vinyl Japan) and one mini-album: "Dark Shuffle", featuring the Unkestra.
