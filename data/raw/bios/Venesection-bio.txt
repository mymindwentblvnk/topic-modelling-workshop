In October 2003 Robert, Ronald and Felix get to know by more or less big hazards and decide to mount something musical together. They begin composing the first songs, which yet drift most intensive in the direction of Hardcore/Punk.
In March 2004 Björn joins the group and changes abruptly the style of the originated quartet, whereby Trash-/Deathmetal takes up station smoothly in the following compositions.
In November/December 2004 bassist Ronald leaves the band to dedicate amplified to Punk. Shortly afterwards the now in a threesome performing boys “The Fixed Pattern Noise” introduce their first demo tape “Divided Soul”.
In January 2005 after long applied powers of persuasion Niklas as a Bass-apprentice decides to give the riffs of Tfpn the necessary power, whereupon several months of practising follow.
In the summer of 2005 the four boys are ready at last to perform again. Felix leaves the band in July 2005 so Asmodi-Drummer Volac acts reputably for him until Felix returns after three months.
Subsequent to his return “The Fixed Pattern Noise” changes their name into “Venesection” and begin the preparations for a second tape, which has been produced from April to August 2006. Without releasing the tape soon after Venesection decides to break up temporarily for refining themselves.
In January 2006 the change to Asmodi of Björn has been announced. A few months later in April 2007 Robert and Felix meet again. They decide to continue with the Venesection-story together with Niklas and their new guitar player Jasper.
