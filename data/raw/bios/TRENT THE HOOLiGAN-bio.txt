The son of a pastor, raised between Florida and North Carolina, Trent the Hooligan is living proof that the South still has something to say. After OutKast and UGK expanded his imagination, Trent used his natural facility with language to make powerful rap music that speaks to the difficult realities of the world without ever preaching to the listener. Trent leads by example, sharing stories of injustice and adversity to create music that inspires a new generation of listeners.
