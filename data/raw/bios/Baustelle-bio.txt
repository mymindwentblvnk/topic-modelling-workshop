Baustelle (a German word that means "construction site" - or "building site" in english) is an Italian indie-rock band formed in Montepulciano, Siena Italy in 1994 initially by Francesco Bianconi, Fabrizio Massara, Rachele Bastreghi, and Claudio Brasini. 
They didn't receive much mainstream attention for their first two albums, 2000's punk-pop Sussidiario Illustrato della Giovinezza and 2003's La Moda del Lento, though they were critically acclaimed. 
Fabrizio left for perosnal and artistic reasons, after their newly produced and managed third album finally brought them more widespread popularity. 

Now made up of leader Francesco Bianconi on vocals, guitar, and synths, Rachele Bastreghi on vocals and keys, Claudio Brasini on guitar, and Claudio Chiari on drums, the band released La Malavita on Warner Bros. Italy in 2005. Mixing the romantic sounds of British artists like the Smiths and Depeche Mode with Italian composers like Ennio Morricone and Angelo Badalamenti and American acts like Television and Scott Walker, as well as with modern sounds of electronica and indie rock, the record gained immediate attention in the group's home country, resulting in an extensive nationwide tour.
