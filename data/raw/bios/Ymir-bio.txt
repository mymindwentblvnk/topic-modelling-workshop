There are five bands called Ymir:

1. Ymir is a Pagan Black Metal band from Finland. They started in 1998, released a demo on 1999, then they did a demo in 2006 and than after fourteen years they have released their first full-length album self-titled "Ymir". 

2. Ymir is a one-man ambient pagan black metal band born in Italy in January 2008 from an idea of Nartum, composer, player of all instruments, vocalist, and programmer.  The idea was to recreate those cold and depressive visions of Nartum's primordial dreams, of an ancient land where confused visions travel through a painful and melancholic awareness to be alone in their own oblivion...

The lyrics focus on Norse Mithology, Eddic Poetry, Dreams, Introspection, and Nature.

YMIR ISN'T AND WON'T BE RELATED TO ANY POLITICAL PARTY. 

The demo, Hrimpursar, originally pressed to 100 copies, was originally available through Winter Solace, but quickly sold out.  You may contact Nartum at saverio.giove@hotmail.it for more info on getting a copy of it.

3. Ymir is a one-man American black metal band from New Port Richley, Florida, formed in 1996.  Ymir released a full-length in 2004 called "Forgotten by Time" and a split with EmorioR in 2008.  For more info, see Metal Archives.

4. Ymir is a black/folk metal band formed in 2016 and signed to IAECW Records. Ymir has released three singles, including Crush the Serpent in the Head, The Black Room, and The Sun Slowly Sets

5. YMIR is a pseudonymous producer / singer who launched this project after winning Apashe's remix contest for Uebok.
