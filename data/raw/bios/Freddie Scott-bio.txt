Freddie Scott (April 24, 1933 - June 4, 2007) was a solo artist who began his career as a songwriter for Colpix Records, along with Carole King and Gerry Goffin.

Scott recorded the chart-topping hit "Hey, Girl" and went on to chart a string of other Billboard Hot 100 singles between 1963 and 1971. His 1968 effort "(You) Got What I Need" was sampled for the 1989 Biz Markie hit, "Just a Friend". It was also sampled for Ghostface Killah's "Save Me Dear" in 2004.

Scott later hit the oldies circuit, and then released two new albums in the 1990s, one in 2001, and one in 2004. He also was a contributor to Van Morrison's "Vanthology" album released in 2003.
