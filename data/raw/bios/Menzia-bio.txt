MeNZiA is a melodic metal band formed in Barcelona, Spain.

MeNZiA features an unconventional female voice that is the protagonist of this quintet band. Its metal bases presents catchy melodies.  Its lyrics portray a very personal touch on relational topics like love, sex and lust, which are always forcefully explained and full of irony.

MeNZiA is direct in a presentation that will not leave anyone indifferent.  Full of spectacle,
force, visuality and disinhibition, it shows a circus scene dark, a mirror that cruelty and sarcasm reflects the feelings, behaviors and hypocrisy of those supposedly "normal". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Menzia">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
