Conceived in Warsaw back in 2010, the band went through some lineup changes until they established a solid formation in 2014, including Sociak (vocals), Marol (guitar), MÅ‚ynar (guitar / vocals), Artz (bass) and Wasyl (drums). Blending complex, blast-beat driven, darkened Death Metal with slow Doom passages, the band draws its main influences from the likes of Obituary, Immolation, Rippikoulu, Autopsy, Demilich, Triptykon, Cannibal Corpse, Incantation, Hooded Menace, Grave, Disma and Dead Congregation, but they spew all those influences out with renewed vigor. As far as non-musical inspirations go, their lyrics mostly revolve about old school horror/gore movies, personal struggles and the works of H.P. Lovecraft. Bloodthirsty and dripping with menace, these Poles armed with a thorough knowledge of ancient Death Metal create something vile and unearthly. Eschewing all trends, Martyrdoom trudge defiantly, blasting their noxious blend of Death Metal and Doom Metal music, urging cohorts to surrender to them at once. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Martyrdoom">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
