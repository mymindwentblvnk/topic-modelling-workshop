Calling northern California home, and now LA transplants, it wasn't until John Smith and Devin Hardy met at the prized Cal Poly San Luis Obispo where they realized they hold the same caliber of dedication for music. By feeding off each other's passions and determination, they created a stable platform to begin a duo project, and this TastyTreat was formed. 

Both with backgrounds in music (Devin with a forte in drums and John the alto sax), it wasn't until a visit to the famed Electric Daisy Carnival in 2010 that really piqued the interests of DJ culture to both. With inspirations from Hip Hop and R&B as well as this new love for electronic music - combined with their own personal styles, TastyTreat created a genre-bending style, full of emotion and musicality. 

TastyTreat's SoundCloud has garnered millions of listens on nearly all original music, as well as multi-million streams on self-published music on Spotify. Also with releases on Ultra Records, Borgore's imprint Buygore Records, 88rising, and Majestic Casual, appearances on Power106 FM, DASH Radio, BBC Radio 1, & SiriusXM as well as a multitude of releases in the queue, there's no slowing down for this NorCal duo. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/TastyTreat">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
