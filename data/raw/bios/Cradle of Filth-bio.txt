Cradle of Filth is an English extreme metal band, formed in Suffolk in 1991. The band's musical style evolved originally from black metal to a cleaner and more "produced" amalgam of gothic metal, symphonic metal and other metal genres. Their lyrical themes and imagery are heavily influenced by Gothic literature, poetry, mythology and horror films. They have released 13 full-length studio albums to date. Vocalist Dani Filth is the only remaining founding member. The lineup currently includes Marek "Ashok" Šmerda (guitar), Rich Shaw (guitar), Martin "Marthus" Škaroupka (drums) and Anabelle Iratni (vocals, keyboards).

The band has broken free from its original niche by courting mainstream publicity. This increased accessibility has brought coverage from the likes of Kerrang! and MTV, along with frequent main stage appearances at major festivals such as Ozzfest, Download and even the mainstream Sziget Festival. They have sometimes been perceived as Satanic by casual observers, even though their outright lyrical references to Satanism are few and far between; their use of Satanic imagery has arguably always been more for shock value than any seriously-held beliefs. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cradle+of+Filth">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
