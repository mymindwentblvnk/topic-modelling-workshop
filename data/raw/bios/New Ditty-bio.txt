Who could have ever known that Plymouth Rock, home of America's pilgrims, would also be home to an earth-shattering, rock/metal band? New Ditty are leading the new wave in the Massachusetts rock scene. The group, featuring the Murray Brothers, lead guitarist Jesse, bassist Corey and vocalist Taylor, along with drummer Vinnie Malaguti, formed in the fall of 2006. A year later, the group added Shawn O'Kelly as their rhythm guitarist. The group self-released their full-length debut album "Full-Frontal" in early 2008. The album, which was recorded at Concrete Studios and produced by Tony Mori, is a collection heavy-hitting southern-style metal laced with thick grooves wrapped in a layer of distorted guitars. The band rocks out like Corrosion of Conformity, Black Sabbath and Pantera and mixes it up by experimenting with sounds out of an Alice In Chains, Deftones and Shadows Fall playbook. ND has performed hundreds of shows across New England, including performances at the New England Punk Goth Metal Festival, Rockfest 2008 and the 1 Loudstreet Music Festival. They have also performed numerous benefit shows for RAINN (Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network) and "Rock fro RSD". ND was most recently featured on Metal Edge magazine's August 2008 compilation. Their song,"Bipolar Bear" was featured alongside music by heavy hitters such as Soulfly and The Melvins. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/New+Ditty">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
