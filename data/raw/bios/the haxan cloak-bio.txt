The Haxan Cloak is the project of Los Angeles-based British musician Bobby Krlic. Krlic was born and raised in Wakefield in West Yorkshire, England. He studied Music and Visual Arts at the University of Brighton. 

He has played live with Matthew Bower, Prurient, Cold Cave, Neil Campbell and others. He has collaborated with Mikhail Karikis, resulting in a remix appearing on Karikis’s 2009 release, Morphica.

His self-titled debut album was released by Aurora Borealis in 2011, featuring guest players Mikhail Karikis (Sub Rosa), Finn McNicholas (a.k.a. Ultre) and Liam Sparkes of Trencher and Drum Eyes. 2012 saw the release of the one-track CD "...The Men Parted The Sea To Devour The Water", followed by his third album "Excavation" on the Tri Angle label in 2013. 

After Excavation, Krlic put his Haxan Cloak project on hold in order to focus on producing other artists (most notably Björk) and composing film music under his own name. In 2019, after finishing the soundtrack for Ari Aster's film Midsommar, which brought his music to a wider audience, Krlic announced that a new Haxan Cloak album is in the works, as well as collaborations with Father John Misty's Josh Tillman and plans to launch his own label.
