Portuguese metal band based at Aveiro, formerly known as Sonic Flower. Born in 1999, with Zé Luís(vocals); P.N. (drums); Vito (guitar); Ricardo (bass); and Mané (guitar and synth). 
They released the debut demo "Tripnoziak" in 2001.
In 2004, due to professional and personal problems within the band, they decided to take a year off. Later on 2005 they gathered again to continue from where they stopped. They started rehearsing again, but without the bass player, who had been dismissed.
They then decided to change the band's name to The Last of Them to better reflect their new sound. 
Studio sessions began on the late summer of 2006. After the recording sessions, Mané informs the band of his impossibility to continue the project due to personal reasons.
October 2007, another bass player (Van Zeller) leaves the band and Rui Pereira is invited, forming the current line-up: P.N.; Vitó; Zé Luís; Hugo Pereira; Renan Uggioni; Rui Pereira.
