There are multiple acts called Torchbearer:

1) A metal band from Sweden. 

Pär Johansson, Christian Älvestam, Patrik Gardberg, and Plec play melodic death metal with thrash and black metal influences. 

Their debut album "Yersinia Pestis" was released by Metal Blade under license from Cold Records throughout Europe and USA in 2004. Second album, "Warnaments", is a concept album. While the debut dealt with the black plague and its effects through medieval Europe, "Warnaments" deals with two events from World War I- the Battle of Jutland, which was a massive naval battle between the British and the Germans, and  the sinking of a German submarine off the coast of Great Britain in 1915.

2) A hardcore band from New Brunswick, New Jersey.
