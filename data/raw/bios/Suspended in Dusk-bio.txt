The musical evolution of the defunct Underwater Mourning project. Suspended In Dusk was a short-lived endeavour that gave way to the currently active Nerveshatter project. The Ambient Industrial experimentation on the song "Factory 18" from this project was also one of the main reasons for the creation of another project, The Backwards Funeral.



Born out of the the suburbs of Syracuse as well as the confused state of the heavy music world in the Summer 2011, Suspended in Dusk bring old and new elements together to create a different brew for listeners. With a non-stop work ethic and an unmatched passion, Suspended In Dusk has played all over New York State in short amount of time. The debut EP SMOKE & MIRRORS is to be released in SUMMER 2012 with Tours to Follow!
