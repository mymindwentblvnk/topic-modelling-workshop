The Curious Mystery has evolved as a sound that manages to blend such eclectic influences as sixties-style psychedelia with American country blues and garage experimentalism. The Curious Mystery machine employs: banjo, autoharp, homemade instruments, grimy guitar leads, bass, drums, bells and whistles, and vocals (cold night air, slow burning fires and such). While the music definitely feels at home in smoke-filled dives and city warehouses, a la the Velvet Underground, it also seems to be blazenly trekking around the world as a bohemian setting up camp for a bit everywhere from the Old West to the Far East.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Curious+Mystery">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
