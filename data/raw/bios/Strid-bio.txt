Strid was formed in 1993 by Storm (not to be confused with the bassist from GORGOROTH), Ravn Harjar, and Jardar (not to be confused with the Jardar from OLD MAN'S CHILD or REQUIEM.)

Strid released a demo called "End of Life" in 1993, which consisted of one eleven-minute song. Strid then got signed to Malicious Records in 1994, and released a 7" EP. Malicious then re-released the "End of Life" demo with a new logo and pictures, also including the 7" material. Lead vocalist and founder Storm commited suicide in 2001. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Strid">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
