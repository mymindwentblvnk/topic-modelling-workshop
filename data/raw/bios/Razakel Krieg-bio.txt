Razakel Krieg is the solo music of Baalberith front man Razakel,
This is not generic paint by numbers black metal, And covers ALOT of ground.
Varying from Atmospheric/Dsbm/Death/Thrash enthused Black metal,
But not just restricted to these styles...
As a vent for the mental anguish of the composer, we can never tell whats coming next.... <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/RAZAKEL+KRIEG">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
