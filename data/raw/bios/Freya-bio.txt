2) A dream pop/indie rock singer and songwriter from Melbourne, Australia.

 Freya is the solo musical endeavour of Melbourne-based singer/songwriter Tamara Westwood. Inspired by the stripped back simplicity of indie bands such as Pinback and American Football, as well as the art rock and psychedelic experiments of The World Is a Beautiful Place & I am No Longer Afraid to Die and Animal Collective, Freya pens dreamo music; a sort of dream pop, midwest emo hybrid, with smatterings of shoegaze and post-rock in the mix.

Freya began recording in early 2015, although her earlier work (released under a different name) dates back to late 2012. Freya released her first EP Attic in May of 2016, following up with her first full-length LP Stranger Things Have Happened, if Only You'd Remember Them in September of that same year. Since then Freya has put out two EPs; Where to Go When the Year Is Over (Jan 2017), and The Brightest Ones (March 2017). Since her live debut in May of 2016, Freya has played shows supporting Camp Cope, Sad13, Lubulwa, and Diana's Foresters, to name a few.

Freya is currently playing shows in support of The Brightest Ones and has begun writing her sophomore full-length album, due for release in 2018.
