In late summer of 1993, five school buddies decided to form a band. They had good reasons too, because their first gig was already booked! After this rapid start the band continued playing gigs in Sweden and recorded their first EP "Partysongs" in 1994. The music they recorded had a certain garage-quality to it lacking in alot of other swedish punk bands and gained the interrest of the folks of Ampersand Records, a division of Birdnest.
After the release of the single "Fantasy Trip" in 1995 and more swedish gigs, the band went into the studio to release their debut album "Music for the Morons". This album took a big leap in sound, causing some critics to love it while the others hated it. But the audience loved it, and that«s the important thing. The album was a big success all over the world and the band supported the album with a tour through Scandinavia, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Holland and Belgium - and they filled the clubs almost everywhere they went.
The new album, "ED´s Diner" shows the band taking yet another leap in sound. Whereas the critics could be justified in claiming that some of the music on "Music for the Morons" was "stolen" from other bands, with the new album this is definitely not the case. The band has found their own style and the songs, lyrics and production are great. The songs are very varied, with a lot of catchy tunes and guitar hooks.
After all the groundwork put into "Music for the Morons", "ED´s Diner" will be a world-wide release. The album has been licensed all around the world, including the US, Australia, New Zealand, South America - even Africa! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Stoned">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
