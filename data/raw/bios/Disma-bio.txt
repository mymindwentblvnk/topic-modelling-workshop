Disma is a death metal band that was formed  in January of 2007 by guitarists Bill Venner (Incantation, Body of Christ) and Daryl Kahan (Abazagorath, Funebrarum, Ass√ºck, etc.) with the intention of creating some heavy and morbid death metal. 
Shawn Eldridge (Funebrarum) joined the ranks on drums with Randi Strokes (Methadrone) on bass in 2008. Craig Pillard (Incantation, Evoken, Disciples of Mockery, Womb etc.) recently joined on vocals completing the line-up. 

The Vault of Membros demo has been unleashed in November and is directly available from the band. 

The name ''Disma'' is a play on the band Xysma and the word ''dismal''. Fans of the late 80's and early 90's death metal rejoice!
