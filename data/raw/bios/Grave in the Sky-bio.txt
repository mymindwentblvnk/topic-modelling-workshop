Grave in the Sky is a side project from the Israeli noise duo Poochlatz of Maor Appelbaum and Rani Zager also known to some as veterans of local industrial metal pioneers Vultures. Formed in Jerusalem, Israel in 2006.

Joined by Matan Shmuelli (ex Distorted) on drums, Grave in the Sky deliver a heavy dose of industrial-tinged sludge-doom and gritty space rock, with Appelbaum on bass and Zager on vocals, singing lyrics which are actually DVD subtitles for classic horror movies, hence their debut album name (on Heart&Crossbone): "Cutlery Hits China: English for the Hearing Impaired".
