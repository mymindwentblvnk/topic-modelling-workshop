Finnish black / death metal. 

The band did two demos in 2001: "Unland Spidercult" and "Bestial Antaumus". "Unland Spidercult" was originally released on tape by Phlegmcum, the same small label that released the Wormphlegm demo tape. "Bestial Antaumus" was never officially released, only distributed among friends.
