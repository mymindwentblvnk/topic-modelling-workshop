There are two artists known as The Seers:

1) The Seers were a punk and psychedelic influenced rock band from Bristol in the West of England. Originally known as Rip van Satan & the Earth Rats as they made their way through the 1984 underground punk scene, they rechristened themselves as a reference to the American proto-punk band The Seeds. Frontman Steve "Spider" Croom sang an ecclectic mix of belligerant rock n roll with groovy instrumentation alongside Adrian "Age" Blackmore, Jason Collins, Leigh Wildman, and the mononymous Kat.

They received local notoriety and became the first unsigned band to play the main stage at the Reading Festival, in 1988, with that success leading to European tours with major band influence the Ramones. Still, mainstream success ultimately eluded the band, despite cult favorite singles such as “Psych Out” and “Lightning Strikes”. Tensions within the band, with managers, and with attempts for major label signing led to in-group fist-fighting and the end of the group, with it sadly never really reaching to its full potential.

2) The Seers is a project by blues influenced piano rock musicians Brian Collins and Sean Waters of Fort Collins, Colorado in the United States. The duo looks to Ben Folds Five, The Black Keys, and Bon Iver for influence. They are currently signed to Wood Stack Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Seers">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
