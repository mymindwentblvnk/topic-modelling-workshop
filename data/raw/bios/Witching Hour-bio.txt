There is more than one artist with this name.

1) Witching Hour (UK) formed in 1991 with Trevor Barnes on guitar and vocals, Alys Sterling on bass and D.B. on keyboards. D.B. was later replaced by Al Winton. When Al left the band, Ash took over on keyboards, aided by the lovely Morticia, who appears on keyboards in the video for "Slave to the Night". Since Ash's return to his home planet, the band have performed as a two-piece.
After a hiatus during which Trevor and Alys joined the computer game industry and discovered overtime, Witching Hour returned to the scene on Halloween 2006. Since then, they have headlined gigs in London and Madrid, and are soon to appear in Blackpool. They are hard at work on a new album, “Raven”. In the meantime, “Hourglass”, “She's Alive” and “Exhumation” have all been re-mastered and are now available on CD or for download from iTunes.
