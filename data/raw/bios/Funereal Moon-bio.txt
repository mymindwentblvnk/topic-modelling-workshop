Funereal Moon have had a unique approach to the dark arts from their very inception and it has only grown phenomenally over the decade since 1993.  Soon after the 1997 vinyl  release "Grim...Evil..." the band all but disappeared from this planet with only 2 very limited "commemorative/best of" CDs containing a scattering of new tracks being released in a span of almost a decade! Funereal Moon eventually returned from absolute obscurity however and began recording full time once again.
