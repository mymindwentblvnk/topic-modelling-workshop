The Unband has a reputation for debaucherous live shows, being banned from Boston clubs for lighting objects on fire, stripping naked, using alcohol and “prop” drugs, and projectile vomiting. The band was formed in 1988 by bassist Mike Ruffino, guitarist and vocalist Matt Pierce, and drummer Eugene Ferrari. They combined the hard guitar edge of bands like AC/DC and Motorhead with the old-school garage punk attitude of The Dead Boys and The Stooges. They released their debut album in 1996, "Chung Wayne Lo Mein" on Chunk Records. Their sophomore album, "Retarder" was released in 2000 on TVT. Their songs have been featured in the movies “Scary Movie” and “Super Troopers”. In 2004, Mike Ruffino’s book “Gentlemanly Repose: Confessions of a Debauched Rock & Roller” was published, documenting the band’s rise and fall. They were featured in a documentary, We Like to Drink, We Like to Rock ‘N Roll in 2006 at the Modern Drunkard Convention in Las Vegas. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Unband">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
