From parts unknown dwell the ghastly duo. Matter ov Fact & EP are noted to be the last two descendants of the Rap Lords, summoned to the earth for purposes of wreaking havoc. Doing so with raw word connection over warm, gritty soundscapes, the groggy pack have been spotted smoking microphone devices in the New York Metropolitan area. No word has been said to confirm their whereabouts, but eye witnessed accounts of the short man and height man (with no hype man) sharking, frequenting brothels and boisterously blaring their art from random locations have been documented. Some say they are adorned in black cloaks as others have sworn they recognized the two donning the clothes of civilians. Regardless, The Doppelgangaz prefer anonymity alongside the creation of raw substance.
