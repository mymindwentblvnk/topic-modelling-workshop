The Wooden Birds is an American band from Austin, Texas (with members also from Brooklyn, NY), led by former The American Analog Set frontman, Andrew Kenny. Formed in 2008, the band's current lineup (which Andrew Kenny introduces on stage as the "Hometown Fantasy Band") are Leslie Sisson (Western Keys, American Analog Set guest artist, Matt Pond PA) on lead guitar/vocals, Matt Pond (Matt Pond PA) on guitar, and Sean Haskins on drums.

Their debut full-length album, Magnolia, was released in 2009. Since then, The Wooden Birds have played SXSW and toured Europe and the United States multiple times (Europe with Grand Archives, the U.S. with Other Lives, Great Lake Swimmers, The Clientele, Dan Mangan, and Broken Social Scene). They have been known to cover one or two American Analog Set songs in their live set.

In 2010, an EP of demo tracks recorded by Kenny in his home in Brooklyn Heights in 2008 titled Montague Street EP was released by Insound. The band's second album, Two Matchsticks was released in 2011.
