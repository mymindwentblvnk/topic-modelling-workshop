EPITIMIA was founded in January 2008 by Alexander Machtakov and Kirill ‘Nemez’. Their first song was created as an experiment with acoustic guitar, called “The moment of the final spring”. It was upon creating this song that they decided the depressive, metal melodies they induced were what they wanted to keep working with.

"Epitimia (from Greek ἐπιτιμία - penance) is to be understood as an interdiction which, according to Church canons, the priest as a spiritual physician may apply in certain cases in order to treat the moral diseases of his spiritual children".

Soon the first demo “O she, whose name is dying on the tremulous lips” was recorded. The name of this recording is taken from the poem of Russian poet Lev Mei. The music on this demo combines the elements of atmospheric and depressive black metal with lyrics with a visible tinge of romantic influence. This demo was released by Mexican label Self Mutilation Services in a limited edition of 150 copies.

Epitimia recorded their first full-length EP "To the non-existing shades..." in the spring 2009. The release date of the CD is 1 June 2009. The cover art was made by Depraved Designs.

The release will appear on the Beneath the Fog Productions. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Epitimia">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
