There are two artists under the name of Fortunes.

1) FORTUNES consists of Collin DuPree and his wife, Karsyn DuPree. They reside in the quaint yet somewhat happenin' Tyler, TX. Collin has been making music and touring the majority of his life with his family in a band called Merriment and Karsyn has performed with the band on one tour in 2014. Aside from the one Merriment tour, Karsyn has played several solo numbers in Tyler. By day, they run BLISSBRANCH, a lifestyle blog and online shop. The duo is in the process of releasing their first EP, with a record to follow later in the year.

2) Electronic/hip-hop/soul duo from Melbourne, Australia. With roots buried deep in the boom-bap grooves of hip-hop, Fortunes delivers soulful vocals, unique sample manipulations, dark bass lines, & infectious drum grooves. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/FORTUNES.">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
