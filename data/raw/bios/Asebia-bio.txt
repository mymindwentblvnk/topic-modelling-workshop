Asebia was an aggressive k√§ng/crust band with gloomy metal into with both swedish and danish members. In the early 2000s they released their only record "Face of Civilization" through Instigate/Plague Bearer records, but without putting the label names on the actual record. Asebia was quite a huge influence on the danish punk/hc scene, and all members were active in the DIY environment circulating around Ungdomshuset (1982-2007 RIP). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Asebia">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
