Triton Enigma, a new project featuring members of some of Sweden's most prolific bands, Ronnie.B (GRAVE, EX-CENTINEX, EX-JULIE LAUGHS NOMORE), Thomas Nilsson (EX-JULIE LAUGHS NOMORE), and featuring Metallic Kitty (DECADENCE) on vocals. Originally formed in 2005 as an outlet for the members to utilize musical ideas that they felt didn't have a place in their other bands. 

In October of 2007, Open Grave Records signed Triton Enigma. The debut album, "Black Lies" is the result.
