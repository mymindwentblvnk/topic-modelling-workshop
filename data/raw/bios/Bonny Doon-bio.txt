Detroit combo Bonny Doon play pleasantly laconic garage pop infused with a rickety lo-fi country bent. Formed in 2014 by Bill Lennox (vocals, guitar), Bobby Colombo (vocals, guitar), Josh Brooks (bass), and Jake Kmiecik (drums), the quartet introduced itself with a four-song 7" EP released by Detroit label Salinas Records later that year. A second EP, this time a five-song cassette called Classical Days and Jazzy Nights, appeared in early 2015 on Fred Thomas' Life Like label. The band would later reconvene with Thomas to record its self-titled full-length debut. A mix of wry and thoughtful introspection and spontaneous guitar pop, Bonny Doon was released by Salinas in March 2017. The album drew the attention of the Woodsist label, which signed the band for its second LP. Built from improvisations during a weeklong stay at remote Mystic Lake in Michigan, 2018's Longwave settled into a more stripped-down, languid version of their sound. It was recorded at Benton Harbor's Key Club Recording with Bill Skibbe and Shelley Salant. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bonny+Doon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
