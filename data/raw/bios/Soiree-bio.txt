SOIREE was founded in 2003. in Belgrade, when Aleksandar Vaci- Shaca (music producer) and Nina Zelic( vocal),while they were, as usual, hanging around in a spontaneous home atmosphere, got the idea of making a music project, first of all for their own pleasure. After many many years of listening to Lounge and Easy Listening genre of music, they felt a desire to start creating music whic would be based on exactly these kinds of melodies. In 2003. in a small flat in Belgrade, where at that time was Shaca's improvised studio, they started recording songs and after 2 years of work completely finished the entire production of their first album "Little Nothing". Some of their friends also participated in recording: Dragoslav Mitrovic( sax, clarinet), Marko Dojic( violin), Aleksandar Buzadzic ( roads) and DJ Donga (remix of one of the songs). The album " Little Nothing", because of its non-commercial character, stayed unpublished till today, while during the 2004. and 2005. was achieving high chart positions on Radio B92, Studio B, Cross Radio, Radio SKC and Radio Ljubljana. Together with their friends from the band Line Out , they participated in a festival called "Change" in 2004. and "Exit" in 2005. Since 2005. Soiree is not active which doesn't mean that it doesn't exist. Shaca and Nina still have a strong will and desire to continue creating, but they are very discouraged by the current situation of publishing conditions that are present in the Balcans, where it's very difficult to find "a place" for these kinds of music project. Nowadays, Shaca is living and working on various number of music project as a music producer in his private music studio in Belgrade, and Nina is still collaborating with him while, as well, performing with many other musicians in Serbia. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Soiree">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
