Inspired by the movies, music and culture of the 1980's, Street Cleaner is a modern synthwave tribute to the decade’s sights and sounds.

The soundtrack to a summer blockbuster action film that never was, it tells the story of Jack Slade, a cop by day and masked crime-fighting vigilante by night.

So put on your Member’s Only jacket and ray-bans, and strap in for a white-knuckle retro experience. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Street+Cleaner">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
