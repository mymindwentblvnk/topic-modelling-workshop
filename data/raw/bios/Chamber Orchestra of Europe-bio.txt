The Chamber Orchestra of Europe (COE), established in 1981, represents 15 nationalities amongst its 50 members. The players pursue parallel careers as international soloists, members of eminent chamber groups, and as tutors and professors of music.

Performances are given regularly in the major cities of Europe and occasionally the USA, Hong Kong, Japan and Australia. The COE has strong links with the Deutsche Ensemble Akademie and Alte Oper in Frankfurt and the Styriarte Festival in Graz, as well as the Philharmonie in Cologne, the Cit√© de la Musique in Paris, and the Berlin, Bremen and Salzburg Festivals. Among the world's leading conductors and soloists with whom it performs, Claudio Abbado and Nikolaus Harnoncourt are especially important to the COE.

The Orchestra is based in London. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Chamber+Orchestra+of+Europe">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
