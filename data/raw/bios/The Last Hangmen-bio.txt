In the year 2009 The last Hangmen grouped around Highest Lord Executioner Simon, who was tired of enforcing judgments on his own. With Ronny he found a first loyal follower, who prepares The Crowd with martial rhythms for the upcoming death of the convict. Pether was chosen to be the voice of the sentences, Pit swings the second lethal axe and Sören joined finally as torturer using the method of ultradeepsonic to press out confessions of the criminal scum. Now, together these “Servants of Justice” are sharpening the axe and the guillotine, knotting the sling and building up stakes to execute somewhere near you! 

Current Line-Up:
Simon - Lead Guitar
Ronny - Drums
Pether - Vocals 
Stefan - Rhythm Guitar
Sören - Bass

Former Member(s):
Pit - Rhythm Guitar
