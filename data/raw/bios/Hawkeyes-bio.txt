Instrumental Psychedelic Doom

Within hours of guitarist P.F. awakening from the prophetic hallucination of forming history’s stonerest band with bassist Blackout and drummer S.S., Hawkeyes formed around a shared philosophy of “Tune Down, Turn Up”. The addition of guitarists R.A., Kaiser, and Streetknife galvanized their Godzillian ranks. By eschewing traditional song-structure in favour of volume and time-travel, Hawkeyes have created a uniquely monolithic sound, one greatly indebted to their passion for sound-bending, fuzzpriest-built effects pedals, the stoned-apocalyptic vision of fellow purveyors Electric Wizard, and the extra-sensory expertise of Iron Chef/Riffmeister Blackout.

Now P.F.’s hazy prophecy is made flesh and Hawkeyes’ chaotic, psyschedelic brand of space-doom has become the music of the spheres. So grab your Tunescoat and set the controls for the heart of the cosmic nod - phasers on stone. Tune down, Turn up. Hawkeyes.
