Verum is a Polish metal band, formed in 2003 in Warsaw. The founder of the band was Mateusz Iskandar: vocals (2003-2007). Joined by Marta Kiszko: guitar (2003-present), Grzegorz Ziomek: guitar (2003-present), Kajetan Klopocki: bass guitar (2003-present), violin (2005-2007) and Milosz Krauz: drums (2003-2007) Verum played several gigs and in May, 2007 despite Krauz’s departure from the band, decided to record their first album. With the help of former drummer and Asia Brodzka: background vocals (2007-present) they’ve tried to record debut album. However, plagued by Iskandar’s incapacity for recording all the songs they left the studio. Struggling with lack of their own drummer, Verum played just a few gigs with Kaja Kulinicz: violin (2007-present) and Janek: drums (guest appearances, member of LOFT) before the great divide. In Autumn, 2007 Verum decided to play faster, harder, heavier. Soon the band was joined by Vipold: drums (2007-present)(also in Departed) and Mateusz Iskandar left Verum, being repleaced by Jurek Roslon: vocals (2007-present). After half year of improving old and writing new material Verum debut live in new lineup on May 12, 2008 in No Mercy (Warsaw). After several shows they’ve recorded their first finished album in less then one week. In Wegrzce (near Cracov) in Rapidfire Studio under the guidance of Pawel Kluczewski arose the first album containing 8 tracks: 

1. "Interval 01" – 1:22
