Jacob David (born 1981) is a Danish composer and pianist based in Copenhagen. 

Since a child, he was inseparable from the piano, doing improvisations ranging from blues to classical. While playing at nursing homes in his early 20â€™s, Jacob David observed how the music was soothing and would sometimes bring back memories long forgotten. This experience compelled him to simplify his music style; and he began to compose original pieces. 

Alongside his solo project, Jacob David collaborates with music engineer and producer Thomas Haahr, composing soundtracks for film and TV. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jacob+David">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
