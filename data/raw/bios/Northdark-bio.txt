Russian black metal from Moscow created by a man known only as D. in 1999. Recorded two demos, an EP and four full-lengths during existence. On the twelfth cold day of December 2008, D. commited suicide and the sound of Northdark would be silenced forever. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Northdark">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
