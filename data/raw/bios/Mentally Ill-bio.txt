Mentally Ill were one of the Chicago-area's first and most mysterious punk acts. Formed by 4 teenagers in Chicago's north shore suburbs, the band released a 7" EP called "Gacy's Place" in 1979, named after notorious Chicago-area serial killer John Wayne Gacy. Only 300 copies were pressed. College aspirations seemed to put the band to an early end, and outside of a few house parties, the original group never played live. Over the years, due to its crude sound and outrageous lyrics, "Gacy's Place" developed a cult following, finding such famous fans as Steve Albini and Jello Biafra.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mentally+Ill">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
