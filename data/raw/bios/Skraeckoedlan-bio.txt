Skraeckoedlan play music that is groovy and heavy, with most of the lyrics in Swedish. The reason for that is that they think that it gives another dimension to their sound and psychedelicness.

In late september 2009, Skraeckoedlan recorded their first EP,  "Flykten från tellus" (the escape from earth) in the Bombshelter studios in Örebro, with Oskar Cedermalm of Truckfighters as producer/technician.

It's a 5 track EP with an abstract concept about the environmental issues going on, with the polar ices melting, leading to a big horror lizard being awaken from the ice, and beginning to demolish the earth.
And that is also what the name Skraeckoedlan means, horror lizard.

Skraeckoedlan released demo's in 2010, and recorded in January 2011 their 1st full length album, Äppelträdet.
