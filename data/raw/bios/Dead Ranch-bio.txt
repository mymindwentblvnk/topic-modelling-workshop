DEAD RANCH is crushing and catchy. A loud and noisy four piece from Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada where you're 8 hours away from everything. Isolated in their winter city, they started playing local shows in late 2011 to 2012 which quickly turned into a self propelled tour of eastern Canada in 2012. This helped them promote their first recording "Birds of Pray". An EP that has gotten quite a bit of good attention for the guys on the local scene and college radio. They're now finishing writing their debut full length album, and planning extensive tours in 2013. This group that mixes punk, metal, stoner rock, blues, jazz, and whatever else they can get their hands on, has a bright future and the determination to see it threw. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dead+Ranch">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
