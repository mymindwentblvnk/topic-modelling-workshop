Imperious Rex is a Speed Metal band based in US, NY.

Current line up: Nidal (drums), Kaz (guitars) and Nick (bass guitars and vocals).

Imperious Rex was founded in Los Angeles by Nick and Hank (former guitarist). After their first encounter in December 2005, they started writing fast metal, bringing back the metal of the early 1980's (old Metallica, old Megadeth, old Slayer, Judas Priest, Motorhead, etc). After 5 months, George (drummer) and Julian (guitarist) joined Imperious Rex. Later they chose different paths, while Imperious Rex (Nick and Hank) was heading to an European Tour. Rene (drummer) joined in. During the summer of 2007, 11 new songs were written, and the first CD "The Beast" was recorded. After 40 European gigs, Imperious Rex returned to the US in January 2008 a time which brought new changes to the line up. Nidal became the new drummer and Brian took hold of the guitar part, after Hank and Rene parted from the band. 

After recording their second CD "Speed Demon", Imperious Rex was ready for a new tour. Kaz took Brian's place and the three speed demons overtook Europe once again.

The band is currently working on their new album METAL DAMAGE.
