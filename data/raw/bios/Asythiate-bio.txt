Asythiate are a three piece band from a little place in the North-West of England called Burnley. 

All three of us were brought together during high school and all had the burning desire to destroy every mother fucking pretty boy faggot that tries to be something they're not or follows trends and fads, and as we've been getting through our teenage years, we have become hairy, scruffier and above all else angrier at the amount of cunts in this world! 

When it comes to music we aim to have a good time and drink as much beer as possible while doing it. So sit back, listen and let Asythiate rip your fucking nads off! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Asythiate">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
