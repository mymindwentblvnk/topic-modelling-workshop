There are 2 artists under the name “Delight”

[1] Delight is a Polish music band playing modern rock with elements of electronic music, and having a background in metal on their earliest albums. They are currently publishing their albums under Roadrunner Records.

The band was formed under the name SATOR in 1998 in Skawina, a small town near Cracow, Poland. The first line-up was: Paulina Maslanka - vocals, Jaroslaw Baran - drums & guitar, Sebastian Wojtowicz - guitar, Piotr Szymanski - bass and Tomasz Polczyk - keyboards. After a few-months' work the band recorded their first demo tape "...And Remember", released by the underground label Eternal Blackness (as a split record with AT DOMINE). Soon after the demo had been prepared, Daniel Kaczmarczyk joined the band on drums. In the renewed line-up the band worked on and recorded new material for a full-length album. After a year of preparation, the band was able to get 10 songs ready. These songs were to be included In the first LP by the re-named band, DELIGHT. Unlike with the first demo, the new songs were entirely composed, produced and recorded at a home studio by Jaroslaw Baran.
