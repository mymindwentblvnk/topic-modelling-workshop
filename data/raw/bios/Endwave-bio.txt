Combine a passion for music, the internet, Pepsi, Coke, and the urban enclosure of the Delaware Valley, and you get the five kids of Endwave! We'd like to not have to work 9-5 for the rest of our lives, so we just make a little music in a Newark basement. We only ask that you take a listen, and maybe you'll enjoy what we do. Maybe you'll hear about us touring the world, and you can say you were part of making that happen. Or you can say we suck, and go listen to something else. Either way, we appreciate you even caring enough to continue reading this. So in fact, this message goes out to you cool people. Yes you, reading some random bio at 3am, on a school night. Shouldn't you be studying? <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Endwave">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
