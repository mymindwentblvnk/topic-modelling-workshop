Eventually in late 1999 they released their debut album "Methods, this however, didn't take off and the band went into decline with two of the four members leaving becuase of 'musical direction'. Later they, reformed in 2007, got a new bassist and drummer to the ranks and started again where they once left off. They recorded and re-recorded alot of the debut album and released as their new album (with three extra songs to it with new drummer and bassist on that those) called "Conceiving Abhorrence in 2008.
