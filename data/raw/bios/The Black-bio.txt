1. "The Black" is a Swedish black metal band formed around 1991 in Eskiltuna by Make Pesonen from Eternal Darkness and Karjalan Sissit. The first full line-up featured Make Pesonen as "The Black" on drums & keyboards, Dissection's Jon Nödtveidt as "Rietas" on guitar, vocals and keyboards, ex-Crypt Of Kerberos Markus Pedersén as "Leviathan" on bass and "Black Demon" on second guitar. The Black released one demo "Black Blood" in 1992 (later released as a MCD by Necropolis) and one album "The Priest Of Satan" in 1994. The style was simplistic and raw black metal with death and heavy metal touches and sparingly used keyboards. The Black disbanded in 1993 after Euronymous, who was supposed to handle the distribution of "The Priest Of Satan", got killed and Jon moved to Gothenburg. Make Pesonen has reactivated The Black with D. Forn Bragman and Andreas Jonsson from Vinterland & Tyrant. An album titled "Alongside Death" will be released in 2008 by Pulverised Records (vinyl by Hell's Cargo). See the band's MySpace for additional information.

2.  "The Black" is an Italian doom metal/progressive rock band.
The Black is the most important Italian Heavy Doom band. The Band was founded in 1988 by Mario "The Bleck" Di Donato, former band leader of the Requiem, who is widely know on the international rock scene. Mario writes all the band's texts and music and he also works successfully as a painter and as an illustrator of books and CD covers. The Black play a mystic and artistic Heavy, which is sung in Latin to blend Rock and Art together. In the secondalbum of 1990, "Infernus Paradisus et Purgatorium" Dante's "Divine Commedy" is partly revisited in the "typical manneristic style of the Black"
