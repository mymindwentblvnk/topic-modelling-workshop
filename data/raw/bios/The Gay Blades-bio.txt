“If Freddie Mercury sang for Death From Above 1979, these guys would open the show!”

The Gay Blades are a two piece from somewhere in or near New York City and play an acerbic brand of Trash Pop, and make up for their missing bass player with consistent TNT like performances and a heaping spoonful of swagger. The Gay Blades invented it. 

They've released two full LP's to date.
Ghosts (2008)
Savages (2010)
