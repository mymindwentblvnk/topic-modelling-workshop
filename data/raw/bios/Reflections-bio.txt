2, Coming from the ashes of the band SELFCAGE, the new band REFLECTIONS was born in 2000 in Slovakia. Consisting of Milan Mockovčiak (guitars, bass), Tomás Vaľa (guitars, keyboards), and Viktor Halász (vocals, guitars), the members wanted to reflect the band member's own interpretation of progressive metal. Between 2001-2004, they released their self-titled debut album and "Life 2 Wait", then they disbanded for various personal reasons. In 2018, the original line-up reunited to update the songs from these albums, re-record them and release them as "III" in 2021. The band is also writing new material for future releases.

Other bands that have a similar style are PENTESILEA ROAD, HEYOKA'S MIRROR, MASTORD, RAVEN SAD and SIMULACRUM.
