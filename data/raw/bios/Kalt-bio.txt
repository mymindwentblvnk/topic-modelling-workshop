(1) KAlt is a gothic-electro/darkwave project from Belarus.
(2) Kalt is also a French NSBM band formed in 2017.
(3) Post-metal/Blackgaze band from Germany.

The project was created in 2007. But it was only 2008 that KAlt started working on complex realisation of our material. The bands Depeche Mode and Blutengel are the greatest influences on its music and performing style.
In 2008 KAlt took part in the biggest goth-fextival in ex-USSR "Children Of The Night 5" in Kiev (Ukraine). Also now you can listen to KAlt songs on the radio all over the world (some of them: Infectious Unease Radio (Australia) - KAlt in thier playlists since 2007; KULTRA.FM, Befriends Radio (Germany), Synth.FM, Twilight Radio (Russia); Batcave Redemption Radio (United States of America) etc.).
But from 14/05/2010 it's called Kaltherzig.
