31Knots is a band founded in Portland, Oregon by guitarist Joe Haege and bassist Jay Winebrenner. In 1998 the band added Joe Kelly as a drummer; in 2003 he left and was replaced by Jay Pellicci of Dilute. Early albums explored the limits of a guitar-bass-drums rock trio, while more recent work has added samples, piano, and increasingly skewed songwriting that push 31Knots' music into an ever more difficult to categorize genre. They have toured Europe several times since 2004. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/31Knots">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
