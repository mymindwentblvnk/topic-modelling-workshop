There's at least two bands using the name Dethroner.

1) A brutal death metal band from Chile
2) An early black/death/thrash band from Poland.

1) Brutal Death Metal band formed in Valparaiso, Chile around 2000 as a renewal of the band Krucifixion (founded in the early 90's). In 2002 they recorded the first promo cd. In 2006, after participating in a great number of gigs, the group comes to studies SADE to record the album "Bring of Desolation" which was made public in late 2007.
