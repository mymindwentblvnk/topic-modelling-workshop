Halls is South London musician Samuel Howard. The music is performed as a live band featuring Patrick Ghirardello, Ian Jenkins and Joseph Munday.

Formed in London, UK in early 2010, Halls worked on material that would appear on the debut EP 'Halls EP', released in January 2011, which was described as having 'ambient soundscapes buttressed by skitter-step beats.'

'Ark' - his brooding debut album - draws from a palette of crystalline melodies, intense production and panoramic instrumentation to create a deeply personal, constructivist work of art. Evocative in sound and yet isolationist in sentiment, the album is an intense, dramatic and emotive study of loss and modern anxiety set to a strained electronic soundtrack. 

In his new work 'Love To Give', Howard has replaced apprehension and doubt with a muted hope, and just as the sentiment has shifted, as too the compositions and arrangements have moved into the real world. Ark’s electronic templates have ceded to - as Howard says - “embrace the sound of human beings”, and the instrumental palate has widened: brass, tuned percussion, woodwinds, and organs now flesh out the tracks, with digital percussion only used for texture rather than structure. Much was recorded in a theatre in London’s Woolwich, with Howard’s vocals recorded naturally in the large main hall, and passing traffic and street noise can be heard faintly throughout the album.
