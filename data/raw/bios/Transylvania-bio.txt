Transylvania (Can) :

Born in the fall of 2006, Transylvania is a black/heavy metal project I solely created, highly inspired by french Black Metal bands Peste Noire, Alcest, MÃ¼tiilation and the likes. At the time, I was only seventeen and was not yet able to produce decent sounding material, so I chose to make no official release of my work yet. Two years went by as I slowly improved my guitar skills and musicianship, still alone in the project. By the spring of 2008, I had finally managed to record my first real demo entitled 'Ravage Total'. After receiving nothing but positive comments about my music, I decided to continue composing songs for Transylvania. In the winter of 2009, I had successfully recorded 'As The Wicked Prosper', the follow up to my depressive heavy metal-ish debut. This time around, I aimed for agressiveness and faster tempos by incorporating blast beats using a drum machine, as I am no drummer and could not find a place to practice. Offering potential live songs on my second demo, I realized that it would be a good idea to make a band out of this once one man project. And so the search began. After a few phone calls and with the help of my good friend Jimmy, a place where I could jam freely was now in my hands, as well as competent musicians.
