Formed in 2005, Baby Stab Horror came together to record their first release, MANIFESTO INFERNALE, after Thrash Metal virtuoso Demither and long time collaborator Maloderous joined forces with underground black metallers Sardon and D. Blast to create a new force in the stagnant New England metal scene.

The band released their second album, IN THE NAME OF SATAN, on Rotting Corpse Records in 2008. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Baby+Stab+Horror">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
