3. Sermon was founded in the fall of 1997 in Germany, when Frank and Ray met. After some initial disappointments looking for a drummer they found Thorsten. They recorded one demo in the spring of 98 and the second in the summer with the help of Nikolai Potthoff of enfold. Unfortunately, not long after that, guitarist Ray left  Germany to go to college in New York, marking the end of the experiment in brutality called sermon, though the band got back together for a well-attended reunion in early 1999. 

After Sermon split Frank and Thorsten formed the kinetic crash cooperation. 
Years after the band split Kunal from SuperFi Records stumbled upon the demo mp3s online and liked them enough to offer to release them as a 7inch. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sermon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
