Kafka Tamura have been quietly stirring a blog buzz since their debut album “Nothing To Everyone” in 2014 which has quietly racked up over 15 millions streams. The trio first met when Germans Patrick and Gabriel discovered the unique vocal of 20 year old Emma Dawkins from Southampton (UK) on Soundcloud. Last year Emma moved to Berlin to work on music with band mate Gabriel Hauser. Now working as a 2 piece in the same city it makes their record making process a lot more natural and dynamic, Emma explains “We needed time to discover our new approach, we're trying to let the songs come to us in a natural way”. Throughout 2016 they played shows across Europe, constantly introducing new songs and experimenting their sound. With the first demos in the bag they teamed up with renowned British producer Eliot James (Two Door Cinema Club, Kaiser Chiefs, Noah and the Whale) to work on new single “Find Me Well”. Emma explains "For us, Find Me Well is the start of a new beginning. With this song, we are completely ourselves. It's about taking a tough situation, and building character from that. It's full of anger, sadness and joy. We like to leave the song to interpretation, so everyone and anyone can put them self into it.
