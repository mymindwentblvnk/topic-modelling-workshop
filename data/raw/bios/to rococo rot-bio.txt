To Rococo Rot was a mostly post-rock trio from Berlin, Germany. Members are bassist Stefan Schneider (also of Dusseldorf group Kreidler) and brothers Robert (guitar, electronics) and Ronald Lippok (drums, effects). Ronald Lippok has also gained praise for his work in Tarwater. The band's name is a palindrome.

The group's d√©but was released in 1996 in the form of an untitled picture disc (subsequently reissued on CD by Kitty Yo), with the more widely distributed "Veiculo" (released by UK indie label City Slang) appearing the following year. In 1997, the group recorded an album's worth of material with producer David Moufang. Following a move to Mute Records, the band released "The Amateur View" in 1999 and "Music Is a Hungry Ghost" in 2001, and "Hotel Morgen" in 2004.
