A Three of Signs was born out of a night of inspiration between V-Kaos and NH.
A first recording was done that same night. Soon after the two people realized that this would be a project worth going forth with.
P.Tosher joined as drummer completing the setting and adding further to the groove.
A Tree Of Signs play Doom Rock with a scent of the 70's.
The lyrics consists of older Alchemical manuscripts. The idea is to have the texts come to life in a musical Ritual.
The band consists of V-Kaos on vocals and keyboards; NH on bass guitar and P.Tosher on drums. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/A+Tree+of+Signs">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
