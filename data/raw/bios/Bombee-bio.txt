Room to breathe – or the art of minimalism. BOMBEE are searching for freedom in the cage. The band from Chemnitz, Germany, arrived where they feel home. Their new full-length album (Release April 1st, 2016) “Golden Cage” is reduced pop music – without unneeded layers. Bittersweet and minimalistic symphonies for the listeners’ souls. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bombee">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
