Luzbel is one of a handful of formative Mexican metal bands, forming in the eighties and helping to jump-start an apparently healthy underground metal scene in their country. Their story is no doubt similar to other metal bands from non-mainstream countries, in that they release countless albums that are well-received locally but rarely are heard outside their homeland. As demonstrated on their 2000 release 'El Tiempo De La Bestia', Luzbel's sound is rough, raw, a bit thrashy in places, and clearly early 80's-inspired, almost bordering on NWOBHM in feel, though the Spanish lyrics set them apart from British bands. Despite a rather low-budget sound, this is an enjoyable album. Given that their last releases were compilations, it's not quite clear if they're still active. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Luzbel">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
