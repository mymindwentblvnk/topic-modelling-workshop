Oathbreaker is a post-black metal/hardcore band from Gent, Oost-Vlaanderen, Belgium. Formed in 2008 and currently signed to Deathwish Inc., they started life as a hardcore band with metalcore elements, their musical style has increasingly incorporated elements of black metal whilst retaining their hardcore framework; with even some shoegazing and folk sensibilites as well as considerable post-metallism.

Their early style was an extension of Converge's chaotic metalcore approach. Although their sound can be identified as 'crusty' in parts, they were never an actual crust band, perhaps the closer to that they ever got were some of Cursed-inspired most metallic moments. Caro's clean vocals approach is reminiscent of fringe post-metaller Julie Christmas. Her harsh vocals became more desperate an unhinged as records progressed. They also slowly began incorporating blast beats and tremolo picking melodies into their sound until even reaching blackgaze moments with the release of Rheia.

The lineup includes guitarists Lennart Bossu and Gilles Demolder, drummer Wim Coppers (who replaced founding member Ivo Debrabandere in 2016), and vocalist Caro Tanghe. They are a part of Amenra's Church of Ra collective. Following a self-titled EP, Oathbreaker have released three studio albums: Mælstrøm (2011), Eros|Anteros (2013) and Rheia (2016). They are currently in indefinite hiatus.
