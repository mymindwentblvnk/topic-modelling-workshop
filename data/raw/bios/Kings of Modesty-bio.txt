The band was formed in 1994 by guitarist Samuel Hjelt and drummer Rane Simoinen. They asked their friend Henkka Tuura to play bass and Samuel’s older brother Mikael to play keyboards. Current lead singer, Jason Flinck, joined the band in 1998.

In 2007, Emppu Vuorinen, a close friend to Kings of Modesty, helped the band to produce their promo EP including songs “Suicidal Mission”, “Staring Eyes”, “Tailspin” and “Miracle”.
The Promo EP gained a lot of interest and “Miracle” was played by several radiostations in USA.
At September 25th, 2009 they released their debut album “Hell Or Highwater”. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kings+Of+Modesty">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
