GODS WILL BE DONE is a german Post Thrash Metal band.

After the breakup of the band Greed in 2005 the 3 remaining musicians Adam (guitar), Weiland (drums) and Parzich (bass) decided to start work on a new band project. Long time friend Kaspar (ex-Spark / ex-Slyde), a veteran of the local music scene, completed the line up. During the first few practise sessions it became clear which musical direction would be targeted: Fast, Heavy Thrash!!

After many months of searching vocalist Gulle was finally recruited whose character and vocal ability complemented the band perfectly.  The line up for Gods Will Be Done was complete!!

In a short time an intense live set was developed and the uncompromising, no BS reputation of the band was sealed. This quickly led to support slots with Misery Index and thrash legends Exodus.

In Autumn 2006 Gods Will Be Done entered the ‘Audio Labs’ studios under producer Sebi Friebe and recorded their first 5 track Demo. The musical intentions of Gods Will Be Done were finally made clear for all to hear!!  Free from current trends Gods Will Be Done aimed for one thing:  killer, dominating guitar riffs, brutal drumming,  a massive bass presence and aggressive vocals which scream one unmistakeable message: Thrash Till Death!
