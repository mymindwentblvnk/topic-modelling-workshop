LOCOMOTIVE BREATH was formed by former OVEDRIVE-guitarist Janne Stark in 1995. The band was completed with bass-player Ulf Kronsell (BLUE TOWN, E-TYPE, SOLID FLOW), drummer Mats Brandström (T FOR TROUBLE) and singer Herman Saming (A.C.T). "Train Of Events" was released on German BlueStone in 1997 and in Japan on Avex the year after (featuring one bonus track).

In 1999 Mats relocated and was replaced by Peter Svensson (FAITH, MERCY), with whom the band recorded a cover of EUROPEs "Scream Of Anger" and CAPTAIN BEYONDs "I Can´t Feel Nothing" for two tribute albums. Pete was just a temporary replacement and his stool was filled by Jimmy Lexe (VULTURE CAVALRY, SOLID FLOW). His first contribution was on the THIN LIZZY-cover "Warriors" for another tribute album. A demo was recorded, but while preparing to record the follow-up album, ways were parted with singer Herman, who was also working with A.C.T. The band found singer Mattias Osbäck (PAINKILLAZ, CRUSH) who debuted in 2002, on the second album "Heavy Machinery", a name well suited for the heavier musical approach. The album featured guest spots from Roland Grapow, Mattias IA Eklundh, Micke "Nord" Andersson and Pontus Norgren. The second pressing of the album (on Sweden Rock Records) featured a bonus track, "Cant Fake It" (a cover of the band TARGET).

In June 2003 drummer Jimmy was replaced by Ted Wernersson (MANDRAKE ROOT, GROOVER). Ted made his live debut at the Sweden Rock Festival, where the band backed former SAMSON-singer Nicky Moore. In 2004 the band contributed on a tribute to THE SWEET with a cover of "Into The Night". Shortly after the bands debut was also re-issued with several bonus-tracks under the title "Train of New Events". Later the same year Ulf decided to devote his time to the band SOLID FLOW. The band was working on the songs for a third release and decided not to involve a new bass-player in the middle of the process. The band was signed by Lion Music and the bands new album was named "Change Of Track". As the title suggests the band has been through several changed, also musically, where the sound has become both heavier and more melodic. The bass on the album handled by Marcel Jacob (TALISMAN, RISING FORCE). The album was released October 21, 2005 and has received great response.

In december 2005 the band was completed with bass-player Mats "Staa" Petersson (ex. DECPETION, HOF'S, HEADLESS CROSS) and guitarist David Blome (UNCHAINED). We've played quite a few gigs so far this year, and there's more to come!  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Locomotive+Breath">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
