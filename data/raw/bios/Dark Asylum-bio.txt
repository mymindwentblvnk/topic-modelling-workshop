Dark Asylum as it is today came together in it's entirety Memorial Day weekend 2005. Aus, Spidy, and Macabre had been playing together for a while, going through vocalists and bassists. Triton fell into place when he auditioned earlier this year. Byron was the final piece of the puzzle falling into place when he got the spot as lead vocalist. Exuding power and presence while on stage, Dark Asylum is THE band to watch in 2005 and 2006. Being compared to such bands as Fear Factory and Devildriver in the driving force of the guitars, dominating vocals, and pounding double bass drums Dark Asylum's only way is to the top. Catch one of their shows and you can understand why. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dark+Asylum">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
