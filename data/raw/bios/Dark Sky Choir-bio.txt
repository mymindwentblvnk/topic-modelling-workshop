Dark Sky Choir is an original hard rock/metal band from NJ. Formed in 2016, the band originally consisted of four veterans of the local music scene, playing the classic metal music they all grew up listening to. As their local popularity increased as a tribute band, it was inevitable that they soon began writing their own music. In late 2017, original vocalist, Hollywood How, and bassist Joe Stabile were replaced with Brian Allen and John Moyer, respectively. Allen has been the voice of various bands throughout the years, most notably as the front man for Vicious Rumors for almost a decade. Moyer is best known as the Grammy nominated bassist for the world-renowned metal group Disturbed, with whom he has recorded and toured since 2004. Inspired by a lifetime love of metal, Dark Sky Choir brings years of live and recording experience to the stage with their own brand of hard rock and metal. Their debut album was released in 2017 and was soon followed up in March of 2018 with a brand-new, self-titled EP featuring the new lineup, as they embark on their first national tour, opening for Fozzy. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dark+Sky+Choir">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
