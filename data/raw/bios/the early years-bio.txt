The Early Years is a London-based trio founded in 2004 whose declared vision is to create washes of psychedelic guitar noises meshed in with feedback, drones, distortion and wah set against a strong metronomic beat. The Early Years admire the noises of (and have occasionally had their sound likened to) Mogwai, Acid Mother's Temple, Spiritiualized, Sonic Boom, Neu, Can, Tortoise, 33.3, Isotope 217, Jeff Parker, Stars of the Lid, The Teardrop Explodes and general 60's Garage music and psychedelia. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Early+Years">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
