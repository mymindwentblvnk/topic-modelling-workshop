Azel is a one man experimental electronic project from California, inspired by industrial and trance.   He's self released three albums and one EP.  Most of it can be heard at  http://www.soundcloud.com/azel/

Evidently Azel could also be some kind of instrumental metal band.   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Azel">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
