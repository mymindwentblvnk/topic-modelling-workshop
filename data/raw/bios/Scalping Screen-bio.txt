"Scalping Screen" started off in late 2001 as a four-piece band with the idea of getting together and making something loud. 
The band's musical influences came from heavy metal and hardcore punk. 
The band also has soaked up influences that aren't entirely musical, but make up an important part of what it means to be Scalping Screen.
You can hear pure metallic rage the songs, but there is also an unbridled fury that comes from hardcore. 
In march 2007 band entered in TSG Studio to record 12 songs to their third album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Scalping+Screen">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
