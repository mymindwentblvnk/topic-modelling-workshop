Revolutionary Juke Music: That’s what BBU does. The Chicago-based group, made up of MC’s Epic, Illekt, Jasson, and Perez, along with DJ Esquire, first turned music on its ear in 2009, when they released “Chi Don’t Dance,” a fun-filled record that positioned them firmly as the frontrunners for city’s ever-steady and always interesting Juke scene. The local hit wound up garnering the group national attention, including a Best New Music nod from Pitchfork, and helped lay the foundation for the true direction of the group, mixing upbeat and synth-heavy production with social and political commentary reminiscent of Public Enemy and dead prez.
