Sterbend are a three piece "depressive / suicidal" Black Metal band from Greven, Germany. Formed in the year 2000, Sterbend features Winterheart of fellow German Suicide Black Metal artist Nyktalgia, for whom guitarist Asmodaios (â€ ) has also played live bass (he has also played session live bass for American Black Metal band Krieg). Their debut album, Dwelling Lifeless was released in 2006 by German label No Colours and features guest contributions by Skjeld and Malfeitor of Nyktalgia. Sterbend's vocals have attracted particular note as Typhon, as is increasingly typical of Suicidal Black Metal vocalists, uses exceptionally harsh, despairing screams to convey Sterbend's lyrical concepts of isolation, darkness and depression. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sterbend">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
