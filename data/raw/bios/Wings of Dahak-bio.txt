Azhi Dahaka is a powerful Druj created by the spirit of destruction, a three headed dragon which brought ruin to earth. Dahak, whose wings blot out the sky, took over the earthly throne and he brought misery, hunger, thirst, old age and death, mourning and lamentation, excessive heat and cold, and intermingling of demons and men. The music here is created with this spirit in heart and mind.
