Poetry in music form, the cold embrace of sadness and melancholy, horrible and the inconceivable beautiful, of death and the beggar life. The path of Thy Cold Embrace begins in 1996.
In 1997 "A Splendorous Place (is not a dream)" is recorded, Helio GÃ³es records the vocals, the keyboards and drums calling musicians to record the guitars, basses, acoustic guitars and female vocals. It is distributed all over the world and has great good repercussion in the underground.
After 11 years of sleep and total silence the cold and frozen embrace comes back. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Thy+cold+embrace">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
