The band was founded in March of 2007 by the following members : Tihomir Stepancec ,Ozren Loparich, Filip Hajdarovic, Gordan Kocijan, Valentino Kocijan and Nikola Vitez. There were a few line up changes but we don't want to bore you with all those anegdotes, we'll just name the previous members : Danijel Pikutic, Tomislav Modric. Today's line up of the band consists of Filip Hajdarovic (Fitz), Tihomir Stepancec (Tika), Mato Matosevic (Sheva), Ozren Loparich (Loparich:) and Ivan Sebastijan Hencic (Buco). We've had about a dozen shows in Croatia and recorded a 6 track demo CD called ''Dropouts from Heaven'' in 2009 and self-released it in May of that same year. Currently, we are working on new stuff which we plan to record at the end of this year, or the begining of 2010, and are looking for places to play and present you us, our music and our demo. Also, we're trying to get a change of pace, so the stuff we're doing currently is not really like our demo, we're trying to make our music more mature, singable, aggressive, fast, groovy and above all, heavy as fuck. :D You can contact us here at myspace or at frozensolid.vz@gmail.com for booking information or just random chatting. :)
