Devil Electric combine the riffs of old and new in a collision of unholy matrimony.
Droning distortion, heart-pounding drums and rumbling bass all tied in with haunting female vocals.
This is what it sounds like when someone walks over your grave.

Members consist of:
Pierina O'Brien - Vocals
Christos Athanasias - Guitar
Tom Hulse - Bass. Backing Vocals
Mark Van De Beek - Drums
