Formed on 2006, when the New York Singer Tony Brown discovered the great voice of Leona and introduced her to producer Mark. Then, Alex joined the band.... a Cuban phd in percussions....

Good vocalist, good fusion arrangements. Before introducing their own material, they wanted to start making tribute versions of 70s, 80s & 90s music, in fusion with acustic, electro and jazzy sounds.
