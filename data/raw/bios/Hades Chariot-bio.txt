Hades Chariot are a 5 piece Metal band from Liverpool, UK. They formed in the winter of 2006 and began gigging within just a month.
Their first EP, Experimental Cannibalism was recorded in April 2007, with singer Mark Simcock. After a summer tour Mark was replaced by Matt Keeton (ex My Enemy Is Dead) as full time vocalist. Their first full length is titled "The Fields Of Asphodel".

Unfortunately Hades Chariot disbanded in winter 2008 after just two years, but their songs can still be found on the internet. Guitarist Adam J went on to produce albums under the Abdicator name and later Adam J.
