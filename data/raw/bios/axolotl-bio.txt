B) Axolotlâ€™s Abrasive (1981) Ettiene's Brunet project with  Jacques Oger on tenor and baritone saxophone, and Marc Dufourd.
Oger and Brunet plays an avant-garde jazz that is also mindful of contempory music figures such as Stockhausen and Boulez. this project leans toward a percussive playing style with terse and fleeting notes and squeaks. Dubourd seems to abandon the idea of notes altogether. Brunet also plays bass clarinet on some tracks.
