Dizzy Fae is a 22-year-old classically trained singer and dancer. Born in St. Paul, Minnesota and based in Minneapolis, Fae prides herself as a queer Black interdisciplinary artist interrogating the nuances and liberties of love and human connection. As a student of dance (TU Dance) and vocal performance (Saint Paul Conservatory for Performing Arts), Dizzy developed an eclectic style that has landed her on stages alongside The Internet, Kehlani, Poliça, Empress Of, and Jorja Smith. Her debut track “Color Me Bad” debuted on Zane Lowe’s Beats1 radio show while she sat in senior-year vocal class, and shortly after graduation she embarked on a sold-out US tour with Lizzo and Toro Y Moi,  in addition to her own headline dates in America and Europe. Her debut project Free Form mixtape—produced by Psymun (The Weeknd, Corbin) and Su Na (GoldLink, Gallant)— was released on February 2018 to widespread indie acclaim. Her follow-up mixtape NO GMO was released on June 26th, 2019. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dizzy+Fae">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
