HeptaH band was born in April 2010 in order to win the world with their melodies and lyrics reasoned in the Word!
With roots in both the progressive and melodic metal, its members drink from both sources, but always keeping the band in a natural fluency.
Their guitarists are also proficient singers, and press Rhads technique on the guitar and classic vocals, and Ricardo Corsi for his velvety voice and his striking riffs!
The band kitchen has Pianowski on bass, perfect execution always crystalline, and Raphael Jorge riding on drums, giving the touch of a master with speed and accuracy.
That's how this quartet of Sao Paulo - Brazil is gaining space in the Heavy / Prog scene. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Heptah">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
