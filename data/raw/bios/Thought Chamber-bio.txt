Thought Chamber is a progressive metal supergroup assembled by Michael Harris and manager John Purdom.

The band, also featuring vocalist Ted Leonard (Enchant), began through an internet ad placed by Harris. After Michael and Ted spent quite some time crafting the material, they then united with the rhythm section of Haji's Kitchen (formerly on Shrapnel Records) and Outworld keyboardist Bobby Williamson to form "Thought Chamber". This group is all about songs and musicianship, with styles ranging from metal to jazz to classical tinged prog.

The debut CD is entitled "Angular Perceptions", which the band has secured a deal for with InsideOut Music, and was released on April 3, 2007 worldwide. The band is presently working on their follow up record.
