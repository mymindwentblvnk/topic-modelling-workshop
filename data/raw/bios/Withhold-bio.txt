As many other bands they started out playing tunes of their heroes. But in September 2006 they started writing their own and have been doing that ever since. Their style encompasses fast and technical riffs, clean yet aggressive vocals, blistering and searing solos supported by a heavy as a whale rhythmsection. And all that in true metalsongs with some catchy chorusses.

Aardschok Magazine on our first demo 'Bite The Bullet':
“With this demo,the Belgian band Withhold has proven that they can write some great songs. It’s a must-have for every metalfan. I definitely want to check these guys out live! 85/100.” (Aardschok magazine)

March 13 Withhold will release their second EP 'Shelf Of Society', which they produced together with Jochem Jacobs of Dutch Metalband 'Textures'!
