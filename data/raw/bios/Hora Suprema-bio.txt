Hora Suprema was founded in the beginning of 1993 by Giovanni and Lars and their hometown Offenburg, near the Black Forest/Germany. With Jigal and Michael they completed the first line-up. At the time they wrote the first songs and played some local gigs. In October 1994 the first demo-tape vita was recorded, followed up by many good reactions, both local and in reviews of some better known magazines. In August 1995 the "Nacht & Nebel" label released the CD-Compilation Morrigan with one track of the band. In November 1995 Uwe replaced Michael on bassguitar. In February 1996 the Vita tape was added by keyboards and with a new mix re-released. Of both versions the band sold about 300 copies. In September 1997 they recorded the second demp Aphorism which was released in October 1996 In March 1997 they got their first positive reactions. Former they made an Interview with a German magazin, which is the 3rd best-known magazine in Germany called Heavy Oder Was!?. In June 1997 Giovanni leaves the band. There were some musical and personal differences. Since August 1997 they have a new lead singer called Thomy. The guitar is now playing a long-year friend of the band who will leave Hora Suprema at the end of 1997. Since January 1998 we have a new guitarist in the band. His name is Oli. With him we start to write new songs. In summer 1998 we have entered a studio to record a brand new cd, which is coming out in October.
