THY BLEEDING SKIES stands for irresistible, modern Death Metal with no musicial limits“. This was the basic thought when Claudio A. Enzler (My darkest hate, Sacrificium) started to compose songs back in the year 2006. After just 8 months of intensive songwriting and searching for bandmembers they recorded their debut album “Chapters of downfall“.

During the recording session ...for their debut the Dutch label “Dark Balance Records“ noticed them and after a short time they decided to work together.
The Debut-CD “Chapters of downfall“ was released worldwide in May 2008.

The band played a tour through Germany, Netherlands, Switzerland and Czech Republic in the same year and over 30 live single shows until today.

The constant activity of the band made it impossible for one band member to continue his work within the band and so he left Thy Bleeding Skies.
After a short time Oliver Großhans (Ex-Sacred Steel, My darkest hate) joined the band as 2nd rhythm guitar player.

Straight after their tour and the line up change they started the songwriting for their 2nd album “Autumn souls“.

Because of some technical issues in the studio the recordings have been delayed. Further they had to rerecord the guitar tracks, because the band was not satisfied with them.

After another line up change and with the new record in hands the band decided to take the next step and signed a contract with the German label “Whirlwind Records“.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Thy+Bleeding+Skies">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
