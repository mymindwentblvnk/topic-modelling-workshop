Biography
We like music, and we like playing music, and if you like our music, we appreciate it!
This band started with a pot of coffee, a Ford Festiva, and a dream, and we look forward to seeing where this dream takes us. Hopefully it takes us straight to the bank, because we all know, death metal is where the moneys at...........Right?
