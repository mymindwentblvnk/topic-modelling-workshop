Eric Benét Jordan (born October 15, 1966 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin) is an American R&B and gospel singer. His mother's maiden name is his middle, in a scenario similar to Beyoncé. 

Benét's father loved classical music and inspired an interest in music in his son. By his teens, Eric had formed a vocal group with his sister and cousin called "Benét." The group released a self-titled album in 1992 that sold 70,000 copies.

Also in 1992, Benét's girlfriend, Tami Stauff, gave birth to a daughter they named India. The couple's happiness was short-lived when 25-year old Tami was killed in a car accident on April 24, 1993.

In 1994, Benét signed with Warner Bros. Records, releasing his solo debut album, True to Myself, in fall (1996). His next album, A Day in the Life, was released in 1999; its first single, "Georgy Porgy (featuring Faith Evans)" received significant airplay, but the second single, "Spend My Life With You (featuring Tamia)", became a smash hit. "Spend My Life With You" rose to number one on the American R&B charts, was certified gold, and nominated for a 2000 Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group. The album, A Day In The Life also won a Soul Train Music Award for Best R&B/Soul Album, Male. Benét also recorded for Earth, Wind, and Fire's 30th anniversary CD.

Benét has also been active as an actor; he had a recurring role on the television program For Your Love (1998 - 2002). He made his film debut in Glitter (2001). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Eric+Ben%C3%A9t">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
