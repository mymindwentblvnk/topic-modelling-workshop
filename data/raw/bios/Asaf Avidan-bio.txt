In 2006, after breaking up with his long-time girlfriend, he moved back to Jerusalem desiring to pursue a music career. From 2006â€“2011 he featured in Asaf Avidan & the Mojos.

In 2012, Avidan released the single "Different Pulses", followed by the premiere of his debut solo studio album of the same name. The singer's follow-up record Gold Shadow (2015) was similarly successful in Europe, reaching Gold status in France. The Study on Falling followed in 2017.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Asaf+Avidan">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
