Wildcat! Wildcat!, an LA indie pop trio complete with dual falsetto vocals and contagious synth beats have been stirring up quite a buzz with just three singles released to date. Impressively enough that’s all it took to convince the powers that be that they should be cast as Alt-J's support on their west-coast tour. "Mr. Quiche" utilizes the vocalist’s high-pitched abilities well amidst the multilayered Passion Pit reminiscent beat. The music video for "Mr. Quiche" also features a man break dancing in a cat suit. Pick up their debut 7”, out now via Neon Gold. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wildcat%21+Wildcat%21">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
