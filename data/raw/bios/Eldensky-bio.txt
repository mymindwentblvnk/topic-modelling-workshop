The Beginning...

The banner of Eldensky was raised sometime throughout the early segments of the year 2007; bringing forth a sound of the lands - an honor to the heathen and pagan traditions of old. This sound brings together natural aspects of the ancient world; while incorporating themes and subjects from within the savage realms. 

Eldensky summons these experiences - giving them shape and form: But more importantly, a reverberation within the mind.

Built upon a surging storm; Eldensky also features numerous Folk and Celtic motifs.  Ambient soundscapes are also present; completing and rounding out the overall experience. “Elder Tales,” a full length demo was released in late 2007 and since then much work has been put into refining and building upon the Eldensky sound.

The full-length album "From Forgotten Pagan Realms" was just independently released on Feb 16th, 2011 and is currently available through Sounds of the Land Records via the Eldensky homesite: www.eldensky.com
