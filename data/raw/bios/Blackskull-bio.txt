Formed by Fernando Cellarius (guitar/vocals), André Arnaut (bass) and Lourenço Sant’Anna (drums), BlackSkull is a Speed Metal band from Brasília, Brazil, influenced by bands such as Iron Angel, Vectom, Violent Force, Overkill, Exciter, Acid and all the NWOBHM movement. Our purpose is to play as fast and as powerfully as possible, and also to explore and develop the Speed Metal genre, but always remaining faithful to the 80's sonority. As Intoxicated, first name, the band released two demos, Speed Assault Songs in 2006 which contained the songs “Rush To Hell”, “In The Line Of Destruction” and “Full Speed Assault Songs”, and BlackSkull in 2007, that gave a new name to the band, this time with a much better production, containing the songs “Blackskull”, “Maximum Damage”, “Hands On Fire” and “Cérebro Metálico” .This demo was re-released in 2008, only BlackSkull . At the present, Black Skull is composing new material and making shows around Brasília, as well as rehearsing to record a new demo before the end of 2008.
