Pero Defformero is a progressive metal (with folk/šator/montarbo vocals) band from Novi Sad, Serbia. Bandmembers are Milovanović Srđan - Điđa (doboš, orgulje), Mijatović Miroslav (begeš), Friš Saša - Skylab (tambura, orgulje), and Biševac Goran - Biške (domaćin pesme). Their music is influenced by Dream Theater and Južni Vetar.

Being a genetic crossover of John Petrucci's and Šaban Šaulić's children, after growing up rapidly, they recorded the one and only cult album, well known by prog metal lovers from Yugoslavia. After recording this album, they went to the sewers to live there, and haven't been seen since.

In 2008, the band woke up and released one new album. It is described as being the very best of Serbian horror-porno-folk-metal!
