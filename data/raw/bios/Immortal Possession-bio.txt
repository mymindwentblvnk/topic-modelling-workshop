Immortal Possession was formed in September 1990. This three piece powerhouse possesses impeccable timing and unbridled fury. Influenced by the likes of Black Sabbath, Venom, Celtic Frost, Possessed, Voivod, and old Metallica, Immortal Possession had an insatiable urge to create something even heavier.


After a four year hiatus, Immortal Possession has reserrected to once again slaughter the masses. After sharing the stage with such bands as Napalm Death, Brutal Truth, Entombed, Cryptopsy, Voivod, Razor, and many more, the band understands the quality that is demanded by todayâ€™s metal fans.
