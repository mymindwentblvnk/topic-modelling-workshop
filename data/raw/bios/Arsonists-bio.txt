The group formed with five members in 1993 in Bushwick, Brooklyn, New York with the name Bushwick Bomb Squad. The main members were Q-Unique, D-Stroy, Freestyle, Swel Boogie and  Jise One, although the number of members eventually grew to eight. Q-Unique was a member of New York City's well-known breakdancing crew, the Rock Steady Crew. The group released the single, "The Session", in 1996, which found airplay on New York radio stations and brought offers from record labels. They signed with the independent label Fondle 'Em Records and changed their name to the Arsonists. They released their debut album, As the World Burns, in 1999 on Matador Records. The group went from five members, down to three: Q-Unique, Jise One and Swel Boogie, for their follow-up album, Date of Birth (2001). With their live performances, the group is known to be very varied in their rap style, drawing on many old school hip hop and east coast hip hop influences.
