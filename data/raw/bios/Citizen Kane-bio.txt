There are more than one artist with this name:

1) Premier Hip Hop legend and arguably one of Toronto's most talented and creative artists in the Canadian urban music scene is Citizen Kane. For years  struggling both on the street and in the industry has been lying dormant and unrecognized for what this unique brand of raw urban rap music has embodied. And what that brand reps is the true feel and flavor of urban life in the Tdot.
On the crown that is Canadian urban music, Citizen Kane is definitely the crown jewel in Toronto's Hip Hop scene.

2) Swedish power pop band from the early 80's. Released the 7" single "FÃ¶rlorad" in 1981. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Citizen+Kane">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
