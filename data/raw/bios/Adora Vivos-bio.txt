Musically exploring the dark and melodic doom metal of past and present, Rochester, MN based entity Adora Vivos came into being by crafting together each of the band member’s individual strengths and visions for dark metal. They leave nothing to be wanted, combining both clean and harsh vocals, melodic and heavy guitars, intricate bass, and astute drumming. The band was put together in August of 2012 with a clear agenda, which led to their entering the studio by mid October 2012. As a result of careful planning and skillful playing, Adora Vivos released its first single on December 21st. Their single, entitled “These Dark Roads” was available via digital download at the band's Bandcamp address and was followed up by their debut 5 song EP Toward The Empyrean on February 18th 2013.

The band consists of some familiar and new faces to the Minnesota metal scene, such as Joe Waller (Minos, Dread Veil, Dawn of Valor) - Guitar, Vox. James Benson (Amiensus, The Last) - Guitar, Vox. Jaden Adair (Risingfall, Avian, Dawn of Valor) - Bass, Vox and Shawn Grim (Dread Veil) - Drums. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Adora+Vivos">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
