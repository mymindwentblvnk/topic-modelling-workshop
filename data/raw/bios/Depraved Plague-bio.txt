Depraved Plague are a four piece brutal death metal band from Cambridge, England. They take influence from old school death metal around the globe but give it a modern edge that gives them a sound unique to many other current UK bands of the genre. Without the use of effects they create an intelligent sound which isn't over complicated and with quick changing tempos manage to sound almost catchy while remaining extreme. 
Their first 2-track release was in January 2011 and since then have played across the South East and are currently booking shows around the UK for 2012 to coincide with their debut album in May.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Depraved+Plague">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
