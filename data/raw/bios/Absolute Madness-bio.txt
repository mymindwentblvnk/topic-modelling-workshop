Absolute Madness is a Crossover / Hardcore / Thrash band. We started in the Fall of '08. We are from all over Southern California from Fallbrook to Camarillo. We come from bands you may love or hate: Internal Affairs, Holier Than Thou, The Vera Project, Life or Death, Snake Eyes, Broken Needle, Piece by Piece, The Lazarus Project and Carry On.

Currently we are unsigned and focusing on writing. We have a song on the Reaper Records Comp "Mercy For None" that will be out at the end of '08. We will be recording in December so be patient for us to put up some songs.
