The four-man slams of Bandung Indonesia. Yes, we're a fuckin GORE INSTINCT was established in April 2011 in Bandung, West Java - Indonesia, (originally called VICTIM OF GORE), with Miko Rizky - Guitars (ex-Misdirection), Pungky Heriansyah - Vocals (Prostitute Cadaveric, Embryonic Gastronomy, ex-Kromosom) and Ikbal Nugraha - Drums (ex-Kromosom, ex-Misdirection).
The band then changed their name to GORE INSTINCT at the beginning of 2012, in because there are some problems Miko Rizky (Guitars player) also resigned, and formed a new line with Novri Permadi Chandra - Guitars (ex-Blood Thorny), Pungky - Vocals, Ikbal - Drums.
From time to time we may also choose to fill the void. Galih Pratama for our bass player. And finally our new line-up in 2012 was Pungky Heriansyah - Vocals, Ikbal Nugraha - Drums, Novri Permadi Chandra - Guitars, and Galih Pratama - Bass. and in early May 2012 we successfully launched two new songs, a 2012 two-song promo demo is :
1. Syphilis Sickness Of Torture
2. My Special Sperm
But in mid-June until there is a problem that eventually forced our bass player (Galih Pratama) should resign from the band. but not long ago we finally got a new bass player is none other than Rezky Vangestu from Prostitute Cadaveric.
And now we come to the New personnel in 2013. Pungky Heriansyah (Vocals), Ikbal Nugraha (Drums), Rezky Vangestu (Bass), and Novri Permadi Chandra (Guitars).
And early november 2012 we officially joined the Germany label Morbid Generation Records and Rebirth The Metal Productions to release our EP in 2013 entitled "Invasion Of The Body Slammer" with the contents of six shit on it, of course with a new song material, new voice, new sound, and of course lots of SLAM..
For current and future we are ready to play slamming brutal death metal musick!
