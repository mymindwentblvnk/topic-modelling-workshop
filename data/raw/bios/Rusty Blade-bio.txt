Rock band from Singapore:

in 1979, five young rockers from holland village neighbourhood of central singapore met up and form a band. they were zan (drums), khalid (guitar), razak (bass), ghani (vocals) and said (guitar). gigs and road shows in singapore and malaysia have been their activities since. the overwhelm response and the demand for their shows was great then. it was the time where heavy metal culture flows into the region. ghani left the group and been replaced by yantzen till today. said left and joined 'the unwanted' another rock band from singapore in 1985 and been replaced by mamat.

the rusty blade lineup changed over the years, and those changes brought with them some interesting and talented musicians. as for previous band members, we feel it's important to acknowledge their presents as they had contribute to rusty blade's success.

problems with the management in the early 90's cause the band members to go their own way.

zan and khalid went to us to record with ella, made in usa album, which recorded in capitol records studio.

yantzen join malaysian group, may, and made his only solo album. mark noh remained silent in malaysia.
