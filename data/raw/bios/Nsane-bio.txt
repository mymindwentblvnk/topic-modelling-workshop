You must admit - in a way all of us are a little insane. The mission of Nsane is to use this mental tilt of each of us and give pleasure to every henchman of heavy-guitar-shouting-sports. 

After different musical projects Thomas Hartmann (git,voc), Holger Mende (git), Michael Kammholz (bass) and Marcel Lange (drums) wanted to resurrect their evil youth and came together to make an own contribution to the universe of ass kickin music. Since 2006 they started with shouter Marcus Schmidt and present a musical mixture of the hardest kind, classified between the aggressiveness of a tsunami and the softness of a landslide. 

At the end of 2007 the records for the upcoming album have finished. Produced by Ralf MÃ¼ller, Kai Tenneberg and Patrick W. Engel in the Rape Of Harmonies studio, the longplayer was released at Rape Of Harmonies Records in 2008. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nsane">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
