Unpure is a Swedish black metal band formed in November 1991 in Nynäshamn by Hräsvelg and Kolgrim, who form the core of the band. 

Over the years several guitarists have joined and left the band, including Åberg, Vic, Surth (known from Svartsyn), Poock, John Blackwar and Stormbringer (from Imperious) with Hräsvelg playing the drums, Kolgrim the bass and both sharing the vocal duties. In late January 97, Unpure started rehearsing with a session drummer Jonathon as Hräsvelg moved to take over the guitar duty, in preparation for a European tour which got cancelled. Jonathon remained on the drummer's seat however.
The current and most stable line-up thus is:
Hräsvelg: Guitars, vocals
Kolgrim: Bass, vocals
Jonathon: Drums
