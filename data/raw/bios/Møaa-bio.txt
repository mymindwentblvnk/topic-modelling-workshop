MØAA was first conceived by Jancy Rae when she began writing and recording demos while living in the forest near Seattle, WA. Serving as an outlet to process a troubled past, MØAA was named after the MAO-A gene, also known as “The Warrior Gene,” for its connection to increased aggression and perseverance. More than halfway through writing the album, she moved across the world to Venice, Italy where in isolation and in collaboration with Andrea Volpato, completed the writing and recordings at Fox Studio Venice. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/M%C3%98AA">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
