Hollywood Ending is a four-piece band formed in summer 2011. The band consists of Tyler Wilson (vocals, 20), Cameron Byrd (guitar & vocals, 20), Dan Geraghty (guitar, 20), and Chris Bourne (bass, 22). Hailing from Maryland, New York, and the UK, these boys came together with a shared dream of becoming big in the music industry. They got their start on season 4 of Radio Disney’s Next Big Thing competition making it in 3rd place. 

Since then, they have released two singles “You Got Me” and “I’m So Over You” which have been a success with fans and can be heard on Radio Disney. They have appeared on three tours since the formation of the band, opening for artists like Action Item, Honor Society, and Allstar Weekend, playing many sold-out shows across the entire United States and Canada. The past 7 months have brought Hollywood Ending an incredible career. With all of the success they have had already, and their brand new debut album "Always 18" out this August, you can expect great things to come from these boys. They’re just getting started!
