Ascended was formed in May 2006 in Pori, Finland by Lautamäki, Saarhelo and Koski and soon after that also Vainio joined the group. At first the band had no idea what kind of music they would play. After rehearsing almost a year without a vocalist in Saarhelo's cellar and later in local youth center the band finally found singer Sookari in spring 2007. Step by step the style of music evolved into traditional death metal. After releasing a demo, an EP, and split with heathen death metallers, Helcaraxë, Ascended disbanded in May 2011.
