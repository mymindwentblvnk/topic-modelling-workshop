Luminaria is a band from Silesia, Poland that plays gothic metal with both doom and black metal influences.
In July 2002, somewhere in Southern Poland, female guitarist Asia (Xaria), bassist Adam (Anhell) and vocalist Wojtek (Wavoc) started a new band. Soon drummer Michał (Mort, Veris) and keyboard specialist Arek  Karnazycki joined the group. In the beginning we were also supported by the drummer Harry from Kadath the Lost City. The five of us started to compose the tracks for our first demo CD, Arche.
Arche was recorded between 2003 and 2004 and contains about 40 minutes of music. The artwork for the demo was entrusted to a talented Polish artist Wojtek Blasiak. After that recording the keyboard player Arek left the band. Despite that loss Luminaria started to play concerts and compose new music.
In the spring of 2005 they found a new musician, Julian, who became responsible for the keyboard parts. In the summer of 2005 Luminaria signed on with Bombworks Records, an American label. Their first official release, “Arche” is an EP containing songs from the demo plus the bonus track “Al Aaraaf”. It was released on the 13th of December 2005. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Luminaria">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
