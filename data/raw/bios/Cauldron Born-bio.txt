There are two bands with the name Cauldron Born

1.) A US power metal band
2.) A Pakistani death/thrash band

One is a power metal band. Cauldron Born was the vision of Howie Bentley. The guitarist and composer took years in the 90's to form a band with musicians up to his caliber. He eventually found bassist Shawn Kasack, drummer Bill Parsons, and singer Christian Shulcze. The four recorded a demo called "Swords, Sorcery, and Science" and signed with the Italian based label Underground Symphony. With new singer Danny White on board, they released their debut, "Born of the Cauldron" in 1997. After a few years and a re-release of their demos along with some older demos of Bentley's, they released their follow-up to Born of the Cauldron in 2002. It was dubbed "...And Rome Shall Fall". It also had a new vocalist, David Louden. They played several festivals in the following years with live vocalist Zane Matthews, before officially splitting in 2003.

The other is a Pakistani death/thrash band. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cauldron+Born">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
