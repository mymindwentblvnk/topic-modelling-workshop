The music produced by Parisian DJ and producer Chloé Thévenin (who is generally billed by her first name) ranges in scope from floor-filling minimal techno to dark, confessional downtempo, and even blues-influenced indie rock. Her ambitious solo albums are particularly experimental and cinematic, containing a greater presence of guitars, intimate vocals (both sung and spoken), and abstract song structures. An esteemed DJ, she has spun at numerous clubs and festivals across the world, and has released a handful of acclaimed mix CDs. She is the co-founder of Kill the DJ Records, born from the infamous club night at Parisian night club Le Pulp, and she later founded an additional club night and label called Lumière Noire. Aside from club music and culture, Chloé has ventured into classical music, soundtrack work, and the contemporary art world. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Chlo%C3%A9">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
