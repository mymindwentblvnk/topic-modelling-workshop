The Capstan Shafts is the musical project of Vermont native Dean Wells. Renowned for his prolific output, Wells is a musical Bukowski, with songs like the old drunk's short stories: low on length and conventional form, but highly literary and extremely satisfying.

His albums have been released through a number of  labels, including Kittridge, Asaurus Records, Abandoned Love Records, Fall of the West Records, Yellow Mica Recordings. His newest release is a part-compilation album through Rainbow Quartz Records. Euridice Proudhon, released last year by Kittridge, was the first album of the Shafts released in a jewel case.

After relocating to the DC area, Wells assembled a backing band and released the band's first studio album, "Revelation Skirts" in August of 2010.
