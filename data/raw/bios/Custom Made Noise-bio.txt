Custom Made Noise is a 4-piece extreme metal band coming from Thessaloniki, Greece. The band got formed in late 2007 by Vangelis and Achilleas and soon after they joined forces with Tasos and Orestis (ex-Drunkard). With the help of producer Stelios Koslidis (Erectus, Human Rejection ) recorded their first promo EP which gained a lot of popularity and amazing reviews in various zines around the world (including Terrorizer, Rock Hard, Metal Hammer etc) followed by a music video for the song ''Fear The Architect'' directed by Jim Evgenidis (Head Cleaner, Crystal Tears, Drunkard). A few months later Antonis was picked to handle the bass duties and the band started playing shows all over Greece supporting Greek and foreign acts like Nightstalker and Cilice and also appeared in the final of the Greek Wacken Battle and in one of the most mainstream greek TV shows ''Radio Arvyla'' which boosted their popularity. Recently the band has undergone one more line up change with Nick Pavlakis (also in Kin Beneath Chorus) taking the place behind the drum kit, but despite the setbacks, work on the new album is completed. ''Hypoxia'' is a fine example of experimental extreme music displaying various musical influences and a characteristic sound that will set it apart from generic and repeatitive norms..stay tuned and more Noise will be delivered soon!
