Candy Striper Death Orgy (CSDO) was formed in 1988 by Eric Paone (Newton, NH). A total straight up Thrash Metal band with massive breakdowns, Candy Striper quickly got out and started playing the big clubs in Boston (MA.) like the Channel, the Rat, the Axis, Bunratty's (Local 186), Necco Place, and in Providence, RI. like the Livingroom, Confetti's, the Met, and Club Babyhead. This helped get them playing with national acts like Nuclear Assault, Over Kill, Biohazard, Sick Of It All, GWAR, Mucky Pup, Meliah Rage, Wargasm, D.R.I., Coroner, Demolition Hammer, Brutal Truth, Pro-Pain, etc.

Throughout the years they've built up quite a following by mixing music with drag racing. In fact, CSDO's music was played on Popular Hot Rodding, a big TV show on cable's TNN. They've also had their band logo on several Alcohol Funny Cars, Alcohol Dragsters, Pro-Mods and some local bracket racers cars at New England Dragway.

Eric Paone, the frontman (guitarist, vocalist, songwriter and manager), was responsible for getting Nuclear Assault and Meliah Rage back together.
