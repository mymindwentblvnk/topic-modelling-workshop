Falstaff (1) was a French instrumental band that released one album in 1981, Prononcez __ (with a strange symbol in the __). They have a somewhat jazzy sound with electric piano dominant.

Falstaff (2) started as an acoustic duo in Virginia Beach, VA that quickly grew to a full five-person band. Groovy, progressive rock that manages "a mix of emotions too complex to explain in words-happy, nostalgic, bittersweet, sunny." (AudioGalaxy.com) The band released two full albums, Camp Songs and Streetcar Giant, and a special little Christmas five-songer, December. The band has a presense on MySpace and GarageBand.

Falstaff (3) was the musical outlet of Ian Schneller, Shrimp Boat's former guitarist.  The group produced two critically acclaimed but commercially unsuccessful albums and disbanded in 1997 after their record label went under. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Falstaff">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
