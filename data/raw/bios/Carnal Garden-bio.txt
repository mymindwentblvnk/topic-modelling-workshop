Carnal Garden was born by John "Weedow" Dafopoulos (Pigskinner, Puter Deus) somewhere around 2012 only to begin spreading the plague in 2015 after Kostas Analytis (Abyssus, Cryptic Realms, Soulskinner) joined the band. Carnal Garden is a death metal band focusing on the heavy side. The band's debut EP "On The Final Day" is currently waiting to be unleashed.
