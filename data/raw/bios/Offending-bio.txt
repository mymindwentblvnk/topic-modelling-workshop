At the end of 2002, Gropoil (guitar) and Vincent (drums) decided to set up a death metal band. Marco (vocals), Macabus (guitar) and Gelo joined in.

Thus, at the beginning of 2003, Offending began to compose some agressive and brutal hybrid Death Metal inspired by such bands as Morbid Angel, Slayer, Cannibal Corpse, Deicide, Hate Eternal, Sepultura, Angel Corpse, Suffocation,...

From summer 2003, but above all from spring 2004, Offending gave a series of performances with various bands such as Gorgasm (fr), Prophecy (USA), Godless Truth (Cze), Strong Intention (USA), Asmodée, IOST, Imply in all, Genital Grinder, Necropsy, Vaginal Purulence, Pulmonary Fibrosis, Gust, Breakdust,...

In spring 2005, Macabus had to leave the band due to right wrist problems. Loïc (leader of Sad Orion) remplaced him. With renewed stability and determination, Offending intensified their activity by finalizing a demo and giving an increased number of performances.

At the beginning of year 2007, Gelo and Marco leave the band and are soon replaced by Yoni and Jesus "The Butcher", respectively bass player and guitarist in B.S.D.. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Offending">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
