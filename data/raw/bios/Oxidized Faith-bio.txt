Oxidized Faith started as a project way back in the mind of founding member Martin Fortier. Having played guitar for many years, mostly for pleasure or in small projects, he kept having this vision of a technical death metal that would be able to mix his many influences. That style could still retain some nice groove to follow while being unexpected and brutal from the ways it’s merging many styles. Being open minded was always a key and he never hesitated to merge riff styles from every metal sub-genre out there to create some brutal and original music.

For many years, having this idea back in his mind, he was looking for the perfect members to create this beast and, after many trials and lineup change, he finally met the perfect complement to his riffing style in bassist Jean-Michel Fournier (Blastfame - RIP). They immediately started constructing and reorganizing some complex song ideas while really defining that sought after sound. They were later joined on drums by Jean-Philippe Bouchard (Morningless) who was the missing key in merging some daring drums into this craziness. Again, after some trials, they found the perfect fit in Phil Langelier to fulfill their “live from hell” vision of what would be vocals over that madness. Being scared of nothing, Phil was already well known for his noticeable and crazy appearance on the Canadian Idol show where he was even able to convince the judges while singing a mix of Black Metal and Opera!! Oxidized Faith was now fully born and they all started working seriously on the project. They are now ready to launch its madness!!  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Oxidized+Faith">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
