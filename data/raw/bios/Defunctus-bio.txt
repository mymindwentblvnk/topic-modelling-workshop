Defunctus is a thrash metal band located in La Roche-sur-Yon, France, which was created in Februrary 2005. By the time, it only consisted of 3 members : Corentin on bass guitar, Damien on drums and Valentin on guitar. The band began with covers and started writing songs quite early.

After a demo called "Desecration" and a number of gigs (including one at "Fuzz'Yon" which will be recorded), the band met Anthony who became the singer in february 2006.

The band did a dozen concerts with him and one demo called "Old School".Seven months later (in september 2006), Alexandre, who already knew the band's members, joined the band as a second guitarist.

In June 2007, Anthony leaves the band and is replaced by Thomas. It's with this new line-up that Defunctus will release it's second demo "Necronomicon".
