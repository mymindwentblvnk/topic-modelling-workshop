Seattle, Washington's Shoplifting is composed of members Hannah Blilie (drummer), Chris Pugmire (vocalist and guitarist), Devin Welch (guitarist), and Melissa Lock (bassist). The revivalist-riot grrrl punk band started in 2003 and is reminiscent of former riot grrrl bands Bikini Kill and Bratmobile, with major musical similairity with that of Huggy Bear.

Great band to see live.
