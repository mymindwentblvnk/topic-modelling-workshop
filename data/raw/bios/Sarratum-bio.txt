In the year of 1997, Sarrum joined his first band, and up to today there were many bands in which he took part playing the guitar. Mainly Sarrum played and composed songs for the studio band Ziggalur, between 2002 and 2004. After departing Ziggalur Sarrum joined Pergamon; a band with many good, hard-to-find musicians. After a few gigs and loads of studios, Sarrum left the band because of his psychological problems. He also was forced to leave his job, his friends and a great part of his life.

The reunion with his mind started to shine in the middle of 2005. Ideas of countless new songs began to flow and were from that moment on shared with the dark world. More than a hundred songs were written and now are waiting to meet with sun and moon.

Sarratum was formed in april 2006 by the sick mind of Sarrum, and he recorded his first demo. Sarratum comes from Akkadian: a tongue of forgotten ancient times. It means Queen, as Sarrum means King. Sarratum is a one-man-band and will be forever. The main lyrical thweme is hate and dreams which Sarrum or his friends had. Sarratum is not a political band. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sarratum">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
