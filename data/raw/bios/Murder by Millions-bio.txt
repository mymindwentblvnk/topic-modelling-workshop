Murder By Millions, a Dutch metalcore outfit recently released a 3 song promo which was well recieved by the press:
"A live band that can turn a venue into a slaughterhouse" - MetalRage
"These three songs make you crave for more!" - AsIce
"This promo shows a band that should be in the top of the Dutch metalcore scene" - MusicFrom.nl 
"The only bad thing about this  3 song-promo is that it is too short; so I can't for their full length album!" - Zware Metalen.nl

The next step is to find a decent label that will release their full length album, until that time the band wants to play as much as possible.
