Taken from MA:
Previously known as Helvete (Che). After resuming to write music in 2002, Satorius had to change the name to avoid confusion, because in the meantime an Austrian band with the same name had released a full-length.

Satorius is the High Priest of the "Schwarzer Orden von Luzifer".

According to the Muspell Records website, Gotos-Antichristus has been banned in Europe, with every distribution label refusing to carry the release, citing the reason that Satorius is a "fanatical and mad sect-leader." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mountain+King">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
