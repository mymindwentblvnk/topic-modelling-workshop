Got You on My Mind is a jazz album by William Galison and Madeleine Peyroux, recorded in 1999, and later compiled into an album by Galison alone in 2003. Seven of its eleven tracks are by the two collaborators, the remainder are by Galison alone.
The album is made up of a wide variety of material, ranging from jazz standards like Jerome Kern and Dorothy Fields' "The Way You Look Tonight" to pop songs like John Lennon's "Jealous Guy"; and containing two originals by Galison and one by Galison and Peyroux. The instrumentation is also varied, with Galison himself playing six different instruments. Some of the songs are early demo recordings of songs Peyroux later released on her album Careless Love. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/William+Galison+&+Madeleine+Peyroux">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
