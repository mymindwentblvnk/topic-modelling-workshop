Ynfamia is a Dutch thrash influenced metal band from Terneuzen, Zeeland. Formed in early 2009, Ynfamia started as a collaboration between vocalist/guitarist José Leijnse and drummer Boris van der Weij. Later that year, bass player Colin Schoone joined the band, together with Chris van Geel who filled in the position of the lead guitar. With this complete line up Ynfamia was officially ready for action.

A common affinity with the thrash metal genre inspired their musical foundation, while a blend of everyone’s personal influences was added to create a musical composition everyone within the band could relate to. They immediately began writing songs, working towards a full setlist so they could start doing gigs. In the two years that followed, Ynfamia shared the stage with bands like Jaguar, Martyr, Angel Witch, Rompeprop and Paul Di’Anno.

In july 2011, José deceided he wanted to focus more on his role as vocalist, which meant he would no longer play guitar in the band. This led to a long search for a new member. Meanwhile, they continued doing gigs with a four headed line up. After a turbulent time of searching for a new member, having auditions and preparing for their first EP, Kevin Dimmers joined the band in november 2012 to play the bass guitar. Their current line up now consist of: José Leijnse (vocals), Boris van der Weij (drums), Colin Schoone (guitar), Chris van Geel (guitar) and Kevin Dimmers (bass).

On the 24th of November 2012, Ynfamia released their first EP: Human Abomination, which contains four tracks. At the moment Ynfamia is working on some more new material and preparing for gigs..
