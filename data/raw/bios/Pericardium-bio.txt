PERICARDIUM, founded in 1995, is a brutal Death Metal band initially based out of Regina, Saskatchewan. The 1996 album 'Anthems Of Anger' saw a recording line-up of vocalist / guitarist Rob Doherty, bassist Scot Krall and singer Tim Roth. The following year Doherty relocated to Calgary, Alberta, constructing an all new look PERICARDIUM, drafting guitarist Kostis Katsimihas, THORAZINE founder Don Stenhouse on bass with Dave Mills on drums. Meantime, ex-members Roth and Krall forged Progressive Metal act INTO ETERNITY. Rob Doherty would rejoin his former comrades as a member of INTO ETERNITY in April 2003. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/PERICARDIUM">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
