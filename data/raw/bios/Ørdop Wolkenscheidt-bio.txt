Ã˜rdop Wolkenscheidt is a niche electronic music project from Copenhagen, founded in the windy Danish winter of early 2015. The music is inspired by cinematic and storytelling-centered approaches to songwriting and draws on a variety of genres, including downtempo, psychedelic rock, ambient electronica and synthwave. Thematically, the songs deal with tropes from literature and film, such as space exploration, dream theft, time travel and psychedelic drug use. The full-length debut The Unexpected Death of a Time-Traveling Friend was released in April 2017.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/%C3%98rdop+Wolkenscheidt">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
