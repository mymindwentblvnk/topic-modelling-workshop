VANIK is a session musician, studio owner, and live guitarist for Midnight, an internationally-acclaimed, Cleveland-born band. VANIK features a keen sense of urgency and aggression which is not diluted by its fun and uncomplicated undertones. Packed with high-speed grooves, the album boasts relentlessly-precise punk rock battery and swaggering bass lines that would surely make Lemmy proud.
