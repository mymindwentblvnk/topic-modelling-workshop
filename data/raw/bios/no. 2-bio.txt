After the break up of Heatmiser in 1996, many members of the former grunge band moved onto other things: while Elliott Smith continued to pursue his blossoming solo career, co-songwriter and co-frontman Neil Gust pushed forward with the creation of No. 2. 

Consisting of Gust (guitar/vocals), Paul Pulvirenti (drums), (initially) Gilly Ann Hanner (later replaced by Jim Talstra) and a changing roster of friends, the group produced the 1999 album "No Memory", an album which carried the style and tone of Heatmiser's final record, "Mic City Sons". 

No Memory was followed up by the 2002 album "What Does Good Luck Bring?". After a lengthy hiatus, it was later revealed that the group had disbanded. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/No.+2">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
