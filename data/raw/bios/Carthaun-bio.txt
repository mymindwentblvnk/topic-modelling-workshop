Carthaun is a Black Metal Band formed in Rostock (Germany) located at the Baltic Sea. Since it's foundation in 2000 Carthaun had to overcome many difficulties. After some line-up changes the band moved to Dresden (Saxony) where it finally found its current members U (git), S (b) and H (dr).

Using catchy melodies ranging from traditional to experimental Blackmetal the band was able to release two demos in 2004 and 2005 plus finally a complete album called "Einheit" last year. Spiced with thrash and heavy elements, Carthaun can be compared to Darkthrone, Gorgoroth and Kvist.

Their music is often inspired by poems (such as "Die Raeuberbrueder" written by Joseph von Eichendorff), operas or german legends and myths to recount an own weltanschauung and the band's philosophies. More lyrics include subjects such as Antichristianity, War, and Nature.
