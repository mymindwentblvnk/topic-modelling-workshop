From their BandCamp page:  "The Undercover Dream Lovers is the psychedelic indie rock band whose name speaks for its smooth dreamy sound. The Brooklyn, NY based project blends vibrant synth melodies with grooving bass lines, topped with writer and producer, Matt Koenigâ€™s, soft captivating falsetto. "

Their first release was in 2017.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Undercover+Dream+Lovers">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
