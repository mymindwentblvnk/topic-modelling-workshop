Cloakwheel began in January 2005 when Vic and Pete left their old thrash band Offering to pursue something completely different. Joined by Pete's younger brother John on bass, they began jamming and writing material. It took 9 months for them to complete the lineup which ended with the addition of Vengince's Marcus on lead vocals and guitar. In early 2007, John decided to leave the band to pursue other passions. For the better part of 2007 and 2008, Cloakwheel recorded their forth-coming record "This Crooked Path You've Drawn" while auditioning numerous Bay Area bass players. In September 2008, Cloakwheel welcomed John B. into the band. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cloakwheel">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
