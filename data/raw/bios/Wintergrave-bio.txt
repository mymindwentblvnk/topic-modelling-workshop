Wintergrave was founded in the winter of 2007 in Porsgrunn/Skien, Norway. Niklas, Truls and Jonas wanted to create a black metal band with progressive and symphonic elements. All guys have different musical backgrounds and thought it would be a great idea to form a band. Later they got Frederik on vocals and Jan Fredrik on bass. Meanwhile Jan Fredrik has left the band.

They have 2 releases so far:
"Results of Humanity" (demo 2008)
"Final Termination" (EP 2009) <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wintergrave">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
