Flesh for the Beast are a melodic death metal band from Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA.  The band formed in 2004 by former members of Sadomasochism John Rios (vocals) and Steve Giles (guitar).  In the Spring of 2005, they were joined by former Sadomasochism Guitarist Jason Salmer and Drummer Jason Kandea. Their debut album, Devouring, was completed in early July, with Rios and Giles sharing the producing credits.

The year 2006 brought on new challenges when original bassist Arzachel left the band, and was replaced by Mark Kinley. Founding guitarist Steve Giles was soon to follow, for personal reasons, in the later half of the year, and is now replaced by Ed Ryan, also formerly of Sadomasochism and the recently split Summon.

Flesh for the Beast have shared the stage with numerous well-known national metal acts, such as Cannibal Corpse, Vader, Origin, Immolation, Byzantine, Dimmu Borgir, Cattle Decapitation, among others.  

Flesh for the Beast have released to albums, "Devouring" (2005) and "Scavengers of the Damned" (2007), both on Slaughterhouse Records. 

The name of the band is taken from director Terry West's horror film of the 
same title, released in 2003.
