Ordained Fate was a (nearly all) female Christian thrash metal band from Zion, IL.  The band was originally  three women and a male drummer:  Pam Scott - lead vocals, guitars; Marge Curtner - Bass, vocals; Annette Cvengros - lead guitar, vocals; and Terry Cvengros - drums, vocals.  In 1992 they released their self-titled debut cd on Word/Wonderland.  In 1995 they self-released a second cd, Glimmer of Hope.  By this point Marge Curtner was no longer with the band, and they used a guest bass player, Bob Goss. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ordained+Fate">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
