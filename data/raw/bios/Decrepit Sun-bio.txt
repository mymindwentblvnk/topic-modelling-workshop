'An intense, savage wave of extreme Aussie heavy metal!'

'Remember when pain, held me in place? Made to the slave - limited potential? Untold the screams, the silence in shrieks - how lovely it seems to reminisce on my chaste!'

Decrepit Sun have been described as thrash/death/melodic/groove metal band.
While their music offers a raw and unique epitome of these styles, the sheer diversity and texture of their influence proves to create much more.

Sardonic, sexually charged vocals.
Blasting, razor-precise drums.
Pummelling, polyrhythmic bass grooves.
Tight, aggressive guitar with twisted intertwining melody and lead.

Since 2003 Decrepit Sun have evolved into a vicious 5 man attack of audio hostility.

2010 saw the release of debut EP 'Ten Knuckle Taunt' engineered/mixed/mastered with Ren Reich of Reich (Melbourne) Records - Altona North.

Decrepit Sun are now set to release their debut Album 'Violent.Aggressive' March 2012 continuing the collaboration with Ren Reich.
