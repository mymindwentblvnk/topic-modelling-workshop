Doominhated is the latest project of Lord Cabal, who has been in the Italian underground since 1996, singing and playing guitar in various metal bands. After the release of 2 demos under the moniker of Doominhated ("6 Tears of Pleasure" in 2004 and "The supreme race" in 2005) and 1 as Ringwraith ("Tales from Middle Earth" in 2005, another Black Metal Project based on The Lord ot the Rings, but different and more epical than the main band), signed with Blackmetal.com. Doominhated's music is a mix of black metal and gothic influences, with some epical echoes. Many of the comments and reviews talked about Lord Cabal's CD as "true" but sometimes "unusual", with something new to say...
Look out for "The Supreme Race/Inferno Caput Mundi" on Blackmetal.com and "Tripudium" on Militia Templi Record.
