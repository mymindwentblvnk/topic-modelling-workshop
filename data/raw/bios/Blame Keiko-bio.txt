Blame Keiko started out as a one man project at the end of 2009 before progressing into a Two-Piece Stoner/Sludge/Doom inspired Noise Rock band. By August 2010 Blame Keiko once more became a one man project. The sound had originated from the lovely county of Shakespeare in the United Kingdom as a fuse of avant-garde, windy progressive rock, ambience and down-tempo doom/sludge/drone influenced vibes and eventually progressed into a much more progressive and shoe gaze influenced black metal project still mixing in previous styles. The band features Guitarist & Gizmo artist - Thomas Garner, drummer and vocal guru Richard Speakman, and also saw Drummer & Broken Mic Vocalist - Thomas Brill in the past. Blame Keiko is a heart straining spiral of progressive rock, down-tempo ethos, dirge and art. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Blame+Keiko">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
