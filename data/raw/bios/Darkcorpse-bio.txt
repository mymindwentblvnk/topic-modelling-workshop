Darkcorpse is a horde of drunks from Kanagawa, Japan churning out an unholy, black fucking noise. Originating with Kraahl, Harbinger, Morax and Ays in 2011. The ranks have since shifted, the torment has not!

Kraahl - Vomits of Hate
Korvus - Six-stringed Napalm Raids
Septimus - Thundering Artillery
Skuld - Kuntkussive Salvos
