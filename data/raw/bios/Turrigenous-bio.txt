Formed in 2006, Turrigenous is a progressive metal band based in New York City. In two years, through relentlessly performing in the New York area, Turrigenous has earned a solid reputation for playing technical, complex and diverse melody-driven music that has attracted fans with various tastes in metal as well as tastes in other genres. Turrigenous strives to give the listener something more; to express a range of human emotion through music that employs both abrasive dissonance and accessible consonance, which some describe as "dynamic" metal.


Turrigenous' influence are drawn from a wide variety of mainstream artist from the Beatles to Slayer, and also include many progressive and fusion artists from the 1970's to the present day. Despite this, their sound is coherent and concise. Although they are progressive, they appeal to a wide range of listeners, and consistently back it up with their remarkable performances.
