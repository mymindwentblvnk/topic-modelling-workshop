The new collective, MISSING, was initiated by Charlie Fell (Abigail Williams, ex-Lord Mantis, ex-Avichi), Ken Sorceron (Abigail Williams, ex-Lord Mantis, ex-Aborted) and Jeff Wilson (Wolvhammer, Abigail Williams, Chrome Waves, ex-Nachtmystium), with the trio bringing in longtime collaborators and previous/current bandmates, Jef Whitehead (Leviathan, Lurker Of Chalice, Twilight), Sanford Parker (Corrections House, Twilight, ex-Nachtmystium, ex-Minsk) and Fade Kainer (Statiqbloom, Theologian) into the mix. Uniting countless years of writing, performing, recording and touring experience between the six-member sect, MISSING promised to be one of the most anxiously awaited extreme musical underworld acts this year.

MISSING has already begun talks with studios and engineers to record their maiden works this Summer for release in the Fall months. Stand by for tour dates and additional info on the band’s 2015 plans for annihilation to be released in the weeks just ahead. - Ear Split Compound <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Missing">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
