A new artist from Chicago Ken Camden joins the label with a blend of 70’s electronic music that flirts with Eastern melodies.
Camden explores the guitar effects with sustained and long extended delays allowing the creation of the perfect atmosphere in order to produce dialogues between the guitars and drones.
There is a trance induced moods specially when kind of zither comes out on “Raga” as a backdrop while synthesizer guitar like sounds producing a charming ambient.
The song that close the album “Jupiter” comes from a different genre, more close to modern composition.
As a whole this record produces gorgeous soundscapes. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ken+Camden">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
