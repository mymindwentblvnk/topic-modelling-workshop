Death metal/crust band from San Francisco, U.S.A. Formed in 2007.
A brutal combination of Low end Metallic Distortion, Pummeling riffs and Gnarled vocals, Acephalix
takes influence from all over the map of Extreme music-from CELTIC FROST to CRO-MAGS and INTEGRITY, from WOLFPACK and Later ANTI-CIMEX to SACRILEGE and AXEGRINDER.
