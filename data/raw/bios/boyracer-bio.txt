Boyracer is an English/American indie rock band formed in Leeds in 1990. The only original member of the first line-up is Stewart Anderson,  the main songwriter. They released their first singles on the UK indie pop label Sarah Records and eventually disbanded in 1996, but after Stewart Anderson married Jen Turrell he reunited the band with Turrell on bass and vocals and Ara Hacopian on drums. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Boyracer">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
