Kohai formed in mid-2003 as an acoustic duo, and quickly grew to incorporate a rhythm section for a larger sound. The band's sound is collaborative effort of four intelligent, thoughtful individuals who are all committed to making the absolute best representation of the music they hear in their heads. Kohai released their debut album, "What We Are Waiting For", in 2005 to lavish reviews.

The drums are groove-oriented with forays into pounding tribal rhythms, the bass is melodic and fluid. A swirling mixture of guitars and synth sets the stage for melodic vocals and just-thick-enough harmonies. A touch of folk, a touch of dream-pop, a bit of progressive rock and a decidedly familiar bit of deranged sexuality tinge the music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kohai">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
