Tesserakt is an instrumental progressive metal band from Poland.

History of the band goes back to winter of '06, when Tomek Zawadzki (drums) and Pawel Mucha (lead guitar) decided that the band 'Margines' would break-up and made an attempt at forming another one, which would be focused on making a more subtle kind of music. Shortly afterwards, Tomek Kowal, a bass player, joined, and a trio with a stable line-up appeared. The band not only wrote new music, but also searched for new sounds. It started as simply as it could - with the keyboard - but the idea was quickly given up. Looking for a vocalist began when, suddenly, Adrian Malek, a violinist, joined the band, and it was then that you could say was the start of the real Tesserakt.

The band members decided to give up vocals in favour of the violin realising that it would give them a much bigger chance to use musical instruments in their music. From the beginning, the band was overwhelmed by the idea to make progressive music. However, the musicians did not feel like clinging to standards and sounds typical of this genre, as they still do not these days.
Of course, it cannot be said they are not influenced by other bands such, as Dream Theater, Rush, Yes, Liquid Tension Experiment, Project X and so on.

Still, the band tried to walk their own way and, thanks to their efforts, they managed to reach the stage at which ultimate sound and style begin to take shape. You could say that the pieces of music composed by Tesserakt are made up of lots of blocks, lying scattered on the ground, which the musicians try to put in the right place. Sometimes you need to cut off one or throw away another.
