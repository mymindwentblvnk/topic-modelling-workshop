Christian was born in London where he trained in classical piano from an early age. He defected to the "darker" arts in his teens completing his musical training on the road, playing and MD'ing for numerous bands and acts around the UK and the world.

During this time he set up a recording facility in west London, where he went on to record, play, produce, and program for the likes of: The Freestylers, LTJ Bukem, Roy Ayers, All Saints, MC Conrad, Richard X, Lovestation, Plump DJ's, Jamelia, and Scott Walker.

Christian joined Air-Edel in 1997 and quickly found himself programming on a host of films for composers including Anne Dudley, Patrick Doyle, Rupert and Harry Gregson - Williams. Whilst undertaking these apprenticeships he developed a successful career in TV, going on to write music for over 40 prime time television series, both for domestic terrestrial and international markets, alongside a host of commercials.

Christian's break in film came after contributing substantial sequences for films including Universal's Spy Game, and Mirimax's Dirty Pretty Things. He has since spent the last three years working as a film composer in his own right.

In 2004 the Warner Brothers' film Chasing Liberty, scored by Christian, opened in over 2,000 screens across the U.S. Later in that year, he was nominated in the "Best Newcomer" category at the World Soundtrack Awards for his score on the UGC film Les Fils Du Vent.

Christian lives in London and has a large scoring facility based centrally in the heart of Soho. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Christian+Henson">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
