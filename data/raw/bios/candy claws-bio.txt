CC lives and records in Fort Collins, CO. Members include Ryan Hover, Karen McCormick, and Hank Bertholf.

Their debut album "In The Dream Of The Sea Life" struck the hearts and ears of internet music dorks, and they have been riding a residual wave of praise since. Their sound and their aesthetic is familiar and unique; they smoosh Pet Sounds harmonies through Animal Collective gurgle and approach the aftermath with naivety and wonder. Their music is both classic and totally modern.

Candy Claws explores the wonders of our natural world through the lenses of mid-century lounge music, 60s pop, 70s nature documentary soundtracks, a single 80s drum fill, 90s shoegaze, and modern sampling techniques. 

A remastered version of 'In the Dream of The Sea Life' was released on Irish label Indiecater Records  on August 4, 2009. A CD version was released on October 26, 2009.
