Long time lost krautrock classic delivering a dynamic, complex combination between fuzzy freak out improvisations (full of Hammond organs and catchy heavy guitar leads) & folk epic arrangements for the flute. They published only one album in 1970 in a rather anonymus way at D. Dierks's studio (for the Brain label in a very limited edition, lately re-published by Second battle). A very accomplished essay. Similar to (early) Deep Purple, Nosferatu and Rufus Zuphall.
