Castrofate is a thrash metal artist premiering in 2007 by singer / songwriter / lead guitarist & bassist Dan Castro, with the debut album ‘Awakening of the Beast’. Dan then decided to hit the studio again after just a few months with a brand new set of material for the 2008 sophomore release ‘Cataclysmic Insanity’, the first to be engineered by Vin Cin (TYPE O NEGATIVE, RAMONES) at Electric Plant Sound Studios in Brooklyn, and also the first to feature Dmitriy Shnaydman (EXIT TO ETERNITY, DEAD MEN DREAMING) on drums. The second album was followed by some incredible touring experiences as Castrofate embarked on international tours in Ecuador and Europe. Immediately following the return from Europe in March 2009, Dan once again hit the studio for the 3rd album ‘iHuman’. This album marked the first cover painting by Eliran Kantor. The band conducted a short tour around the US in August 2009 for the 'iHuman' album. Now, Dan is putting the finishing touches on the 4th Castrofate album ‘Systematic Suicide’ which features the most fast energetic thrash metal Castrofate has ever written before. The album will be released in 2011, hopefully in time for Castrofate's debut appearance at the prestigious BB KING'S in NYC on October 2nd, which will feature the best, tightest Castrofate live line-up thus far, featuring John Orsi (GODAMHATE) on Live Rhythm Guitar and Mike Poplees (SEVENTH CALLING, 26 PIECES) on Live Bass. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Castrofate">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
