Dustin Tebbutt is an Australian-born singer-songwriter from Sydney.

Falling for the northern hemisphere.. the notion of life in winter and the appeal of a hibernation far away, Tebbutt relocated to Sweden to live and work, write and record. The result was this tenderly-sculpted music about that move to the other side of the world.. The things he left or lost along the way, and the person that came back. The lead single and title track from “The Breach” is available on Itunes or www.dustintebbutt.com with an E.P  released in Australia.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dustin+Tebbutt">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
