Synth-pop and Rock n’ Roll are in fact pretty good bed-fellows.  And when Mittekill are behind the controls the pop rocks and the rock pops and yes you guessed it, they just can’t stop.

Like musical magpies, Jan Hohmann aka Neurot and Friedrich “Freedarich” Greiling have collected all that glitters and all that’s gold about the 20th century’s sonic landscape.  The best of your 80s collection takes on laptop loops with the odd ghetto glitch.  While one dresses in a bespoke suite and likes to play with conservative chic, the other hogs the limelight and charms us with his crooked smile and his air guitar.  They have supported Spitting Off Tall Buildings, RichardKool, Doc Schoko and were also part of the legendary ‘Windfall of the 80s’ tour with Nachlader.

Their music is crazy in a lo-fi sense and serve to both contrast and complement their unconventional lyrics.  There is also a prevailing sense of loss to be felt in their music, which is both deadly and endearing. Similar to outfits like Grönemeyer, Mittekill have for years been pushing their unique sound and educating the ears of their listeners while doing so.  And as the saying goes; if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mittekill">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
