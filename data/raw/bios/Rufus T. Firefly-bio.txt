Rufus T. Firefly, the band led by Víctor Cabezuelo and Julia Martín-Maestro is already, despite the youth of its members, considered a cult band within the independent Spanish sounds.

Its deeply sophisticated energy and sound flees from the obvious and builds in each production and direct an atmosphere of magic and rock with slips towards a neat and highly addictive psychedelia.

 

The band was formed in 2006 and after twelve years of career already has 2EPs and 4LPs, among which include "Ø" (2012), "Grunge" (2013) and especially "Nueve" (2014), which was the maturity of his sound and was recognized by media and critics as one of the best national works in that year.

 

In January of 2017 they published "Magnolia", a record in defense of art, love and nature in the form of 10 songs.

A beautiful album, risky and ambitious, marked at all times by that obsession of the band to try to perfect its sound and the depth of its textures to create a unique work , as beautiful as possible. A year later sees the light "Loto", the second part of Magnolia with which the band closes an episode before desapear to continue experimenting with new sounds. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rufus+T.+Firefly">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
