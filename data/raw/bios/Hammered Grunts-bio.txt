Punk band from Portland, OR (U$A).
The band “Hammered Grunts” was established in early 2004, to the dismay of neighbors and music snobs alike. The group consisted of four friends dedicated to being involved and making music in the local Vancouver and Portland punk rock scene. 
After many live shows and experiences, the band recorded and released their own 15 song street punk self titled album. 
With support from playing many cities in the Pacific Northwest, fueled with relentless motivation, the band delivered a very successful 5 state 23 shows tour in Aug. 2008. 
Next the Hammered Grunts recorded a split EP with Hometown Hero’s “Rum Rebellion” and will displayed another 6 song onslaught of energy & angst. “Hammered Grunts” also went on a summer 2009 tour to support the record. 
The band continues to write, play, and perform with immeasurable heart and enthusiasm, producing songs more energetic and original than ever before. Since 2010 the band HG has been taken big steps towards playing and producing more of a thrash feel with their music. Hammered Grunts is working on releasing there next album “Street Thrash” which includes 12 tracks of a much more brutal sound.
