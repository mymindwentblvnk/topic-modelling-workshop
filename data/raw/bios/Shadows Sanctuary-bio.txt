I am the official founder/ vocalist /writer/ lyrics for 
Shadows Sanctuary
(Disbanded in 2011 after the release of our first pro recording EP (HAILFYRE) .
2 Original members of FROM THE SHADOWS NH
 My self (Shawn Boucher),Jim Clute(drums)
Hooked up with a number of guitar players,and bassists
to help rewrite some of our FTS fans favorite songs!
and also ended up writing some great new material! 
so we changed the name to SHADOWS SANCTUARY

with the power metal influence of axxe's guitar 
and tj's  shredding talent,we were taken by force,by a new powerful entity!
WITH THE GREATEST SUPPORT FROM OURS FANS
AND FINANCIAL BACKING FROM ED AND NADINE!
WE STORMED THROUGH THE INTERNET AND LOCAL LIVE SCENE!
JIM AND I ARE PROUD TO HAVE BEEN PART OF THAT 8+ YEAR REIGN!
I AM CURRENTLY WORKING ON A                  NEW POWER METAL PROJECT
 SHADOLYNX...NO I'm NOT DONE YET!
