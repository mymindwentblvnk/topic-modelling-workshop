Battleheart is a Scottish heavy metal pirate band which changed their name to Alestorm in August 2007. The change of name came when they signed with Napalm Records.

Musically they resemble Korpiklaani and Turisas, with their own Scottish touch and Pirate lyrics.

They had released two downloadable EPs on their site (www.Battleheart.co.uk). The site now redirects to the Alestorm site and no longer has the downloads. Alestorm will be recording their new album (entitled "Captain Morgan's Revenge") in the coming months and a release date has been etched for February '08.

Christopher Bowes: Vocals and Keyboards
