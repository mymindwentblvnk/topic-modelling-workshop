Diamanthian's logo was designed by the infamous Jeff Walker (Carcass) who also oversaw the recording of the band's debut album 'The Infinite Descent' under the alias of "Offalmangler".

Diamanthian are big in Finland, often apparently having achieved better more rabid enthusiasm from the Finns than some people on home soil.
Diamanthian were voted eighth Best Unsigned Band in Terrorizer's Reader's Poll 2002; and the following year were voted Best Unsigned Band and 9th Best Live Act in the Reader's Poll of 2003.
