Vigil was a mid to late 1980s modern rock band based out of Baltimore, Maryland.

The band formed originally under the name Here Today out of the Baltimore's modern rock/gothic music scene in the early 80's. A single Whistle in the Yard drew some attention from CBS Records, and the band was signed. In 1985, the band changed its name to Vigil, but was dropped by CBS. Vigil was quickly signed by Chrysalis Records, and in 1987 released their debut self titled album "Vigil". Then band went on tour in support of this album as the opening act for The Stranglers.

In 1989, the band returned to the studio to record a second album, tentatively titled "Escape Artist". During this period, Chrysalis dropped the band. One track from this period, "Therapist", was released on the A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master soundtrack.
