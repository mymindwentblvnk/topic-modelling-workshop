(2004 - 2006)

A comedy/experimental metal band from Florida in the United States of America, Crotchduster's style is reminiscent of Mr. Bungle, but with a much looser grip on sanity: they mix multiple forms of metal with classic rock, blues, soul, grindcore, rap, jazz, techno, a cappella and many other musical forms. All of which are done in a parody style, even the metal. They make fun of specific genres of music, bands, and specific musicians with puerile or nonsensical lyrics, which in Crotchduster's case are mainly references to perverse sex acts, sheer nonsense, misanthropic rants or a combination of all three. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Crotchduster">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
