Andre Ethier comes from another time, a time where simplicity in music-making was favoured over the new tradition of loops and layers and editing, Andre Ethier was born forty years too late.

Andre has been roaming the streets of Toronto for the past decade as a visual artist, waiter and musician. For over ten years Andre has released a bunch of records as the frontman of the critically acclaimed Toronto garage rock outfit The Deadly Snakes. In 2004 Andre took a step a step away from the rock and recorded his first solo record “Andre Ethier with Christopher Sandes featuring Pickles and Price” (Sonic Unyon) recorded over a weekend where first takes were preferred. They just set up, played, drank, mixed and split. Andre’s been compared to seasoned and revered musicians such as Bob Dylan, Nick Cave and Van Morrison.

After recording the latest Deadly Snakes album “Porcella” Andre is geared up to go it alone once again with the help of Paper Bag Records. Andre will also be enlisting the help of trusted companion Christopher Sandes, Andre’s mood has drifted in to the realm of being completely in love, and promises that the next record will be a love record, yet still raw and spontaneous, cause that’s how Andre lives his life.

Until then, he’ll be hitting the road with the Deadly Snakes, he’ll be hitting the road by himself, he’ll be building a house, he’ll be recording a record, he’ll be in love and we’ll all just be waiting. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Andre+Ethier">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
