In 2008, Upon Graves was merely an idea that lay dormant in the mind of drummer and lyricist, Ian Antonelli. However, it wasn't until 2012 that the idea would manifest into something greater. Having previously jammed with Justice Owens, he knew it was the right choice to join forces again. In late 2013, Ian Tomas joined to duo on vocals and guitar.

We are the enemy.
We are the children of fire.
We are the manifestation of the Primordial Chaos.

Let all black abyss fill your senses. Let the eternal ocean of Chaos flood into your soul. Break through illusion. 

Open wide the gates of Hell.
