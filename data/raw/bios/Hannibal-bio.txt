There are multiple artists/bands under this name:

1) Marvin Peterson, known as Hannibal Lokumbe - a koto and trumpet player who composes under his first name, Hannibal started out working with Pharaoh Sanders and others in the avant-garde jazz community before releasing his deep jazz masterpiece "Children of the Fire" in 1974.  His operetta "African Portraits" premiered at Carnegie Hall in 1990 under the baton of Daniel Barenboim.  It featured contributions by Jevetta Steele, David "Honeyboy" Edwards, and Hannibal's own jazz trio.  Since its premiere and recording, it has become something of a cult favorite.

2) Legendary, rare UK psychedelic rock album on B&C Records from the early 70's. Once Clem Clemson left Bakerloo the group stuck together and changed their name to Hannibal and this is their incredibly rare album, and shoot me down with a water pistol if it ain't chock full of horn led progressive, psychedelic rock. It reminds this freak a little of "If" or the "Web" album, and it's just as good. Reissue taken from the original masters, now that's a rarity!!
