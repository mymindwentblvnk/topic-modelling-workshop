Formed in 1992, Tha-Norr is a black metal band hailing from Germany and like most black metal bands of that era, their sound was heavily influenced by their Norwegian forefathers – Darkthrone, Mayhem, Burzum and others -  but still drawing prominent influence from the ”First Wave of Black Metal”.

Tha-Norr’s discography is rather restricted; they only released a demo and a full-length before splitting up. However, a split with Desaster was planned in the mid 90's but it never saw the light of day. Part from that, the full-length ”Wolfenzeitalter” has been re-released a couple of times since 1995.
