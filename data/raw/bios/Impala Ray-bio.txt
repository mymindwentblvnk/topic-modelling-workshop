Out of the city, across the river and into the woods. This is the dream of the young man from Munich, when he feels cramped once more. His roots are in the valley of the Jura caves, where he often played as a small child cowboys and Indians. And this place inspired him to create his own acoustic hunting grounds amidst the city: IMPALA RAY. His songs tell of white palms, the last great love and his great-grandfather a blacksmith. You can feel the life and struggle in the instruments. Crickets chirp with the banjo, while the Tuba browses like a storm over the wide plain.

 

His music combines authenticity with an honest grown folk appeal: Joy of songs, melodies and wink. Things that pleasures most the music listener â€“ and right in the middle of it the very own mirth, melancholia and coziness. You can find IMPALA RAY on the streets and squares of the city where he gives spontaneous concerts. And there he and his band raise their BayFolk tunes between the blocks. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Impala+Ray">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
