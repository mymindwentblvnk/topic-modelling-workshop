The stars aligned and in October 2014 Neil Hagerty (Royal Trux, Pussy Galore, The Howling Hex) and James "Wooden Wand" Toth went into a Denver studio with the crack rhythm section of Darin Gray (Tweedy, William Tyler, Wooden Wand) and Eric Van Leuven (The Howling Hex). The full length "Qalgebra" was the result of those sessions. Hagerty and Toth share songwriting and vocal duty with both of their unique voices and styles equally shining through. Shifted out of time, the Hagerty-Toth Band would have been your favorite 70s denim jacket patch as this is new age garage to both sooth and expand your soul. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hagerty-Toth+Band">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
