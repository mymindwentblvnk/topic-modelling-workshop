2. Black Storm, based out of Edmonton, Alberta, is a solo act (Brian Walker). Founded in 2006, work began on his debut CD in late 2007. 

This album of 11 tracks is an eclectic and energetic mix of rock, prog rock and blues. While the lyrics may appear dark, they are based on life’s experiences… insightful and 
thought-provoking.

Walker’s music has been influenced over the years by Rush, Pink Floyd, Dire Straits and Roger Waters. You’ll hear this in the disc of 2 blues, 3 instrumental and 6 straight ahead rock tunes.
