1. Dysmorphic is a technical death metal band from France. They originally formed as Necroticism in 2008 and released one EP under the name but in 2009 they changed their name to Dysmorphic. Since then, they have released a single titled 'Sceptical Existence' the same year, a self-titled EP that was released in 2010 as well as a full length album titled 'A Notion of Causality' which was released in 2013. Some bands their sound can be compared to are; Decrepit Birth, Odious Mortem, Arkaik, Man Must Die and Neuraxis, to name a few. Certain elements from each band separately are evident in their music but Dysmorphic still maintain their own identity.
