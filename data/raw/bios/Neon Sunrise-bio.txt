Neon Sunrise was founded in 1998 , the five piece aims to create an individual way of modern power metal. Influences of different metal-genres were put together to create the sound of Neon Sunrise. The first CD "Burning in the focus" was released the same year, critics of the national ( german ) and international press were great.

In the year 2001 they released "Twisted nerve" that showed out more approved technical abilities and know how in songwriting. Although some of the critics weren´t so good, reviewers who were into power and progressive metal could be convinced.

The year 2002 should be a very turbulent one. After formerly singer Dirk Zimmermann left the band, also Markus Becker , formerly bass player did. Both decided to put their eyes more on forthcoming in their jobs. Nevertheless Neon Sunrise released their next CD "New soul design" were new singer Mirko Mucha was presented. But left also the band shortly after the recordings.

The Neons were again in auditions for a new vocalist to replace Mirko.

Since 2004 Tim Lorentz is in place as the new stunning vocalist, first reviews underscribed this fact. In the meantime Alla Fedynitch was replaced by new bass player Hagen Utikal. So finally they got their line-up together and were ready to enter the stage.
Be prepared to hear new songs full of aggression and melancholy, brutal riffing and  melodies somewhere between Death-, Thrash-, Power- and Prog- Metal.
