Mankinds atrocities and accomplishments manifested into a formidable and unforgivably evil expression of Black/Death Metal. Scaphist, inspired by the majestic past of Ancient Iran/Persia and modern extreme music brings in artistic Phrygian & Dissonant atmospheres alongside harshness, speed and aggression with lightning fast kicks, powerful vocal anthems and crushing guitar motifs to create a unique blend of black and death metal mostly unheard of in their clean green home country of New Zealand. Mostly.

The title Scaphist, is derived from the term Scaphism: an ancient Persian method of execution where the naked person would be firmly fastened within a back-to-back pair of narrow rowboats and then forced to ingest honey and rub it onto their body to attract insects to exposed appendages, the defenseless individual's feces accumulated in the container attracting more insects, which would eat and breed within his or her exposed (and increasingly gangrenous) flesh. Death, when it eventually occurred was probably due to a combination of dehydration, starvation and septic shock. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Scaphist">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
