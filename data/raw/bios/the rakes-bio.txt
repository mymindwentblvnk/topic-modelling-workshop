The Rakes were a four piece indie rock band hailing from London. Releasing their debut album Capture/Release in 2005, The Rakes were the talk of the Reading and Leeds Festival after joining forces with indie elites such as Bloc Party and Maxïmo Park in the NME Tent.

They released their third and final album Klang in 2009 which included the singles 1989 and That's the Reason.

In October 2009, The Rakes announced that the band was to split with immediate effect: "The Rakes have always been very adamant and proud of the fact that we give 100% to every gig we’ve ever played. If we can’t give it everything then we won’t do it. That was the rule we set ourselves from day one". 

Their style can be described as "lo-fi" indie and is vaguely reminiscent of early Joy Division with some catchy guitar riffs and intelligent and humorous lyrics. 

Singer Alan Donahoe has a project called Champagne Campaign and drummer Lasse Peterson went on to join Wolf Gang. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Rakes">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
