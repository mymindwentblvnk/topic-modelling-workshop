There is more than one band with this name.

The first Poetica awoke from the ashes of G.A.R.N. to form a melodic metal band from the Stavanger / Sandnes region of Norway.

Heavily inspired by the founders of SID metal Machinae Supremacy, Poetica started fusing the retro sounds of 8 and 16 bit games into their own image of the melodic metal genre.

The band lineup was completed late 2011, and the name was decided the following winter. Fronted by the gorgeous Stine and the growling Chris on vocals, Alexander and Andr√© on guitars, Rolf on bassguitar and Marius on drums.

On June 14, 2013, the band released their first studio album, Somnus Tormentum, followed by the music video for the track "Rest in Peace."

The second Poetica is a collaboration between vocalist/lyricist Rachael Sage, cellist Dave Egger, and other musicians who lent their talents to the project, which is described as "a creatively ambitious musical spoken word project distilling a poetic spirit through text, voice and music." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Poetica">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
