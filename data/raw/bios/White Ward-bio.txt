WHITE WARD is a Ukrainian black metal act from Odesa that performs intensely deviant music of a noir shade. 

Formed in 2012, the band takes root in a raw depressive black metal, but now sheds all boundaries, taking inspiration from an array of additional dark atmospheres including the writings of H.P. Lovecraft and I.M. Banks, noir thrillers and horror movies. The band's excellent early recordings were gathered in the "Origins" compilation released in late 2016. 

Exploring themes of borderline death states, aberrant afterlife worlds and strange mental disorders, the WHITE WARD sound spans the expansiveness of instrumental jazz and the depths of pitch black existential despair. After recording the first full-length album "Futility Report", WHITE WARD was signed to Debemur Morti Productions and now is primed to embark much further on the divergent sonic journey.

The band continues to evolve and change directions with their second release, “Love Exchange Failure”. Dark-jazz aesthetics appear more vibrant and deeper than ever before, while elements of blackened death, prog, and black metal scream out in an intense fury over vicious blast beats, courtesy of new drummer Noctum! Lyrical themes explore new dimensions, diving into the abyss of human psyche instead of creating Lovecraft-inspired worlds.

In June 2022, the Ukrainian Black Metal innovators are prepared to unleash their third album, “False Light”, incorporating and intertwining various influences into a potent and dystopian mix. “False Light” is an indispensable record from a stunning band at the top of their game. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/White+Ward">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
