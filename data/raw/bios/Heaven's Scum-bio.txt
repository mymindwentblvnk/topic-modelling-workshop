Heaven's Scum is a Metal Band from South of Luxembourg which was founded in Summer 2011.
The sound of Heaven's Scum is composed of deep growls but also clean voice over hard riffs with a melodic and new touch built on drums that punch you in the face!
After a lineup change in Summer 2012, Lex joined the band on drums. Since then, Heaven's Scum grew from concert to concert.
In July 2013, they played their first abroad show in Hengelo (NL) with great success. This show was followed by other abroad shows like in Volmerange-Les-Mines (F) and Saarbrücken (D).
They entered the studio in December 2013 to record their first 15 Track full-length album. The album has been released on April 19th 2014 in Luxembourg.
After several concerts with their first album, the band started to write on their second album which is called “Beyond Human Footsteps” and will be released on March 18th 2017. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Heaven%27s+Scum">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
