in December 2005, a new band started, with the name Inevitable. With Andre and Ronny on guitars, Mathias on the drums and Trygve on vocals. A week after, Ronny was kicked.

Then they got a new guitar player named Marius, and a bass player named Vegard. Both from a local Heavy Rock band named Heavy Snowfall. After only a month playing together, Vegard was kicked, because of bad influences, and Håkon who was the bassplayer of Ishamael joined the band. After Håkon joined the band, they had a hard time finding a name on the band which wasn't already taken by another band.  Finally they all agreed about the name Diabolium.  

Diabolium plays cover songs, but when they're making their own songs they play a fusion of black, death and thrash metal.  With various vocals, mostly growling.  

Setup in the band is: Trygve(Vocals), Andre(Rhythm guitar), Marius(Lead Guitar), Håkon(Bass), Mathias(Drums) <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Diabolium">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
