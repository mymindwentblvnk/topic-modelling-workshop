Argent Strand is a deathcore band hailing from British Columbia, Canada. The band recorded their first demo in 2009 and hit the studio in early 2010 to record their debut EP.  Following the EP, the band plans to start hitting up some shows, so watch out for when Argent Strand is in your area. With the recent change in members, and the band losing their drummer Mark Byoko due to school related issues, the band has suffered a few setbacks, but they are set to release their debut EP entitled, 'Villainous' in 2011. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Argent+Strand">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
