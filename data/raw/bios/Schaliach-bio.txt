Schaliach was a two-man melodic death metal act from Norway.  Their sole release, Sonrise, was originally released in 1996 on Pleitegeier Records; in 2005 it was re-released on Endtime Productions with new artwork and a bonus track.

The band was comprised of Ole Børud (all instruments, some vocals) and Peter Dalbekk (lead vocals).  Ole went on to become well-known as the guitarist and second singer for Extol, before pursuing a solo rock career and then joining funk-pop band Playlife, where he is now.  Peter is the vocalist for another death metal band, Vardøger. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Schaliach">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
