Clonaeon rose out of the ashes of Vaticide in December 2002. The change came about since from the original Vaticide line-up the only ones left were Anders and Johan and during the many changes the sound had drastically changed. It was time. A few months after the change, long time drummer Mikael decided to leave the band due to injuries sustained playing the drums. Bassist Jonas who had played the drums in a
previous band stepped up and took over. Mattias Nilsson was recruited as a new bassist. In early 2004 a promo Strike The Root was recorded. In early 2005 main song writer Anders left the band due to time constraints and while the remaining members still played together for all intents and purposes Clonaeon was over as a band. The band officially disbanded the next year. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Clonaeon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
