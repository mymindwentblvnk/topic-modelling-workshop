Started In January of 2004, In Death We Rise has come a long way in the short year they've been together. After recording a seven song demo in June, In Death We Rise quickly signed to High Fidelity Records to do a three way split with Velvet Dawn and The Linden Murder to be released nationwide in early 2005. In Death We Rise is known for chugging breakdowns, screeching guitar harmonies, brutal high and low-end vocals, as well as face-melting solo's that comprise their unique blend of metal. Be on the lookout for an ass-kicking near you.
