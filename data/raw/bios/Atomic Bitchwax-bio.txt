The Atomic Bitchwax are a rock band formed in a basement during the mid 1990s by then 25 year olds Chris Kosnik of Atlantic Records "Godspeed" and Ed Mundell of A&M Records "Monster Magnet" both from Long Branch, New Jersey. The band's first two albums, I and II, had a heavy psychedelic sound with roughly half of their songs containing only minimal vocals and the rest were instrumental. As the band's sound has progressed over the last 10+ years, a more traditional song writing approach was slowly realized by incorporating the band's signature "boxriff technique" with the Kosnikâ€“Ryan dual vocal harmonies throughout their last three releases "TAB3, Boxriff and TAB4". The band also continues to tour live in North America and Europe for the last decade covering 15 countries.

In 2003 Finn Ryan of Atlantic Records Core replaced Mundell on guitar and in 2007 welcomed Bob Pantella (currently of Monster Magnet on drums following the "Boxriff" tour in late 2006. Kosnik and the current lineup completed recording the next full-length titled The Atomic Bitchwax 4 in Feb 2008 at "Trax East Studios" in South River N.J. for the summer 2008 release on MeteorCity Records. A digital download of "4" is available at the band's website http://theatomicbitchwax.com .
