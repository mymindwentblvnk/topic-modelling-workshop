Spite Extreme Wing was a nationalist Italian Black Metal band from Genova.  They were last signed to the Avantgarde Music label. The band consisted of Argento on vocals, Azoth on bass and keyboards, and Fog on drums. Spite Extreme Wing is part of the B.M.I.A. (Black Metal Invitta Armata) alongside several other extreme Italian musicians. Such bands include: Black Flame, Frangar, Galaverna, Gladio, Hiems, Hippus, Janvs and Tronus Abyss.

Since the release of 'Arcano Incanto', all of Spite Extreme Wing's lyrics have been in Italian.  S.E.W. have released two demos and four full-length albums.

Their debut album was released in 2002, titled 'Magnificat'. Tracks 2-4 are taken from the 'Arcano Incanto' demo. Tracks 9-12 are taken from the first demo and have been remastered. Tracks 5-8 were recorded in November 2001 and track 13 in May, 2002.

In 2004, 'Non Dvcor, Dvco' was released. 'Non Dvcor, Dvco' would then go on to be re-released on LP in 2006, limited to 300 copies with two bonus tracks; '8. Disperazione - La Zona' and '9. Di Nuovo in Armi'.

In 2005, 'Kosmokrator' was released, made of old songs ('95/'00) which, for different reasons, had never been recorded. 'Kosmokrator' is the second part to the 'Magnificat' LP.

In 2008, the final album 'Vltra' was released by Avantgarde Music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Spite+Extreme+Wing">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
