Noituus is a very lo-fi crust band from Turku, Finland.

Formed in 2005, Noituus plays some inaudible, very fast, and terribly untechnical crust-core that they call 'MÖGÄ'. 
Mögä can be resumed as extremely fast D-beat, extremely distorted bass, and extremely tortured screaming, no guitar needed here.
All material are recorded in rehearsing place, on one track, in a total Do-It-For-Yourself way.
