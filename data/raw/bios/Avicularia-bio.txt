Avicularia  played their first show in 2004 as trio, back than strongly influenced by Cryptopsy, Immolation, Deicide, Death, Nile, Morbid Angel. In time music evolved in kind of extreme metal but with odd approach to composition and usage of classical, fusion/jazz and rock music. Avicularia’s debut "Born To Be Vile" (2009) is a foundation of their unusual approach to music and was very well accepted in international metal community. After lineup changes band recorded in early 2013 new song “In Our Hands” as a teaser for upcoming insanity. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Avicularia">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
