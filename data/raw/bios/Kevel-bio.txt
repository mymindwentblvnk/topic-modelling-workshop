kevel are a sludge / post / progressive metal band from Athens, Greece.
Their music cannot be easily categorized in a single sub-genre, as their primary target is to create something somewhat "different".

Started as a 3-piece in October 2012. After various attempts to introduce vocals in their songs, they decided to focus on instrumental compositions. In January 2014, an additional guitarist was welcomed in the team and the band finally established its sound. By mid 2014, they started their first live gigs, while preparing for the recording their debut album.

On 5/12/2014 their debut self-financed album "Hz of the Unheard" was officially released in both digital and physical form (8-panel Digipak, limited to 200 pcs).

kevel currently remain an instrumental project, but open for potential cooperation with vocalists of similar music taste.
