DAY FLY is the music Brainchild of Dutch producer K THE FRESH and English Singer and songwriter BEAU NOX. A DAYFLY is an outlier, a soul that floats on the cusp of social norm. Unbound by principles. A DAYFLY is the ultimate symbol of impermanence and the fragility of life. The new vibrant energy of DAYFLY’s music is a breath of fresh air that brings with it clear notes of heavy set roots in soul, hip hop, and alternative pop. The dynamic duo are now bringing their debut EP to life for their live show (2015) as a quintet, playing with some of Netherlands finest talent. The stage will be seeing the likes of Lennard Vink (Synth/Keys), Theo Jacobs (Bass/Moog) and Timothy Bennet (Drums/SPD). DAYFLY’s EP and live show will be sure to deliver a colourful sonic range, from Beau’s ad libs to K THE FRESH’S synthy guitar licks.
