"Elephant Road" is the self-titled debut album of Bangladeshi-American band, Elephant Road. They were a rock and metal band from Minnesota, USA. The band members come from the old-school Bangladeshi rock music scene and are coincidentally part of legendary bands like RockStrata, In Dhaka, Aces and Warfaze. This album was brought to life when they had to leave the country for higher education and personal reasons. It was released in the USA under NineVoltStudio, and domestically under the label of G-Series in 2004. The domestic release has a very off-axis printing quality of the booklet and it's very difficult to read. The American release, on the other hand, is crisp and contains different artwork components. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/elephant+road">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
