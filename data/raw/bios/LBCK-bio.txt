Most simply hailed as "LBCK", the duo behind the project are Alex Noble & Luigi III. Two funk-inspired producers who's talent has gained the attention of listeners around the globe. Using the age-old ingredients of g-funk, each joint is rolled in soul before being lit up and smoked out your speakers.

The "Long Beach City Kids" are no newcomers to the stage. Their sound is as funky as it gets and their live show is no exception. Their unique light-up letters help set the mood and take the dance floor party people on a dazzling visual trip.

Having toured the US, Europe & parts of South America, the boys have developed a keen sense of appreciation for the homegrown approach, taking it wherever they go.

Their debut full-length album appropriately titled 'The Goods', delivers just that. Stacked with an eclectic bundle of body movers, it's the perfect summer survival kit. Give these guys the decks and a dance floor and they're about to blow, your mind, into orbit. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/LBCK">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
