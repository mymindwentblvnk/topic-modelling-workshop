Sludgelord were an early hardcore influenced doom metal band formed sometime in the late 80's as a post-Sore Throat band featuring the bands singer Rich Militia also handling guitar duties.  They played bluesy doom metal while also mixing crust/grindcore sometimes into the music.  They released a demo very limited and there also exists a rehearsal demo.  Their first studio demo was featured on the Sore Throat bootleg "F.O.A.D." as the first half of the vinyl while a live Sore Throat performance in Germany made up the second half of the vinyl. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sludgelord">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
