There are many artists with this name:
1) Thomas Hauser
Knives are proud to present the debut release from Belgian artist Obsequies, entitled Organn. 

At its core, Organn is a record about love and duality. Taking inspiration from Isidore-Lucien Ducasse's poem 'Les Chants de Maldoror', the record is antagonistic yet often drops its temper to reveal blistered beauty within the fray. Such are the condradictory elements within the compositions themselves: widescreen claustrophobia; glimmering sludge; piercing VHS ambience. 

Visuals come courtesy of French mixed-media artist, Thomas Hauser. Hauser's imagery similarly evokes retrograde surrealism and further insists on a narrative at work here, with obscured characters playing out alongside mantric piano, filmic vox and hyperspeed jungle.
2) Obsequies was formed around 1999-2000, for the purpose of trying to recapture the Necro feeling of the Norwegian Black Metal scene and the Greek Black Metal scene of the early 90's, though this is not a Black Metal project at all focusing more on the Necro side of the above mentioned Metal scenes. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Obsequies">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
