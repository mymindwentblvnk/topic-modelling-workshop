There are Several artists known as 'LSB'

1) The Drum and Bass producer from Essex, England, AKA Luke Beavon.

2) L.S.B. are the infamous duo of BabyG and Pete Herbert. The two met many moons ago in BabyG’s native Barcelona whilst Pete was on a dj mission from London. A meeting of musical minds, the two connected straight away and shortly after formed L.S.B. with a view to world domination and rocking discotheques along the way. 

In 2004 they released their first record “L.S.B. edits Vol 1” on their label Superdiscoteca, a choice selection of some of their favourite dance classics re-tweaked and discofied for the more discerning dancefloor. Soon after this, the powers that be at Belgium’s finest underground label Eskimo Recordings heard a demo of their latest studio recording and signed them up. 

Finally in summer 2006 the first L.S.B. single “Original Highway Delight” was released as a limited white label and heavily supported by la crème de la crème of the scene. After such a success it was re-release at the end of the year with an amazing remix by Mungolian Jet Set.. Considered by many dj’s as one of the best nu-disco records of 2006 “Original Highway Delight” put L.S.B. in the premier league of modern disco producers and remixers. 

In 2007 the second Eskimo single “FOG” was released to an even bigger reception as well as the second LP of “L.S.B. Edits” on Superdiscoteca that sold out first week it arrived to the shops. During 2007 the duo also remixed tracks for Skylax, Love Is War and Memorabilla and artists including Golden Bug, Ilija Rudman and Low Motion Disco. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/LSB">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
