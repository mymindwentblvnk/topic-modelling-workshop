Imaginarium is a five-member band from Zadar, Croatia.
The band started playing 2007. under name Lygophilia, but due to certain reasons, including vocal and style changes, name changes to Imaginarium.
Emphasis is placed on vocal arrangements, rather than the instrumentals (as it was before new name).
We have played several gigs in Zadar, Šibenik, Zagreb..
Style may still be defined as a metal, but without strict restriction on any direction.
In 2011., first demo was recorded, named Dawn of Visions, containing 4 songs.
Our plans are playing live shows and working on new material.

Members:
 Luka Šindija - vocal
Šime Gverić - guitar
Ive Martinović - keyboards
Domagoj Veršić - bass guitar
Luka Popović - drums

Also, Imaginarium is a psy-trance project:
Imaginarium is new born alias of Nikola Gasic,better known as Sonic Entity. Imaginarium is here to take you on a new journey into more deeper realms of Psychedelic Trance, filled with a mix of lot of old school sounds mixed together with new cutting edge production technique full of hypnotic atmospheres which will make them very explosive dance floor material! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Imaginarium">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
