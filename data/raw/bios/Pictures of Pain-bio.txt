1. Pictures of Pain are a Metal band from Rogaland, Norway. The band has a great spectre in their musicstyle, from slow to hard and aggressive sounds, thus it is hard to classify the band's genre. The vocals switch a lot between clean singing, screaming and growling. 

2. A Goth (Deathrock) project from Los Angeles, California.

1. History:
The band was formed by Frode Gundersen (drums) and Hans Helge Iversen (vocals) in 2004. Later on Roy Østrem (bass), Rune Fredriksen (guitar - also active in Thundra) and Arne Marton Tangjerd joined the band. 18-20 November 2005, Pictures of Pain recorded their first demo. The band did their second studio recording in mid of July 2006. The band has received a lot of positive feedback on their recordings, and some record companies have already showed interest for their music. One of them also came out with a suggestion to a deal, but at that time, the band desided to do a full length recording instead, to get even more and better results before any possible signing. In 2010 they signed with Pitch Black Records, and their debut album The Reckoning was released on November 26.
