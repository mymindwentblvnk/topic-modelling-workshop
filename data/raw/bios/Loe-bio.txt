Loe - Australian metal band was born out of a non-existent Bundaberg scene in 2001, Through dedication and persistence the band has consolidated a reputation as a brutal yet passionate metal/hardcore act.

With their popularity rising across the Australian East Coast, the bands efforts where rewarded when they signed to Big Phat Adelaide Records, Modern Music & Sony/BMG in the summer of 2005 for the release of their debut studio EP "Laid To Rest".

Released nationally in March 2006, Laid to Rest's success soon put this powerhouse 3 piece on the road touring from Brisbane to Cairns and rubbing shoulders with established acts such as Parkway Drive, Japunga & Repeat Offender.

With a live show that rivals any international act, do not miss the opportunity to witness Loe live. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/LOE">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
