The synthwave project of Los Angeles-based artist and producer "Red" aka Klayton, Scandroid is a love letter to the ‘80s delivered with modern production and a genre-crossing set of influences. Best known for his work on the multifaceted project Celldweller, Klayton formed Scandroid in 2013 and found a new inspiration for his densely layered compositions by combining ‘80s pop sensibilities with a host of other creative ideas, ranging from classic darkwave to modern electronic music. The result is an immersive audio experience infused with imaginative sci-fi lyrics and atmosphere. "Raven" aka Varien was also part of the project before later departing.

Scandroid’s music has cracked the Top 10 on the iTunes Electronic Albums chart and the Top 5 on the Billboard Electronic Albums chart. Along with his original songs streaming in the millions, Scandroid’s music has also been the subject of several popular remixes, including a Dance With the Dead remix of "Neo-Tokyo" that has accumulated 12 million combined streams between Spotify and YouTube alone.

Following the Scandroid self-titled debut album in 2016, Klayton released a second full-length album, Monochrome (Deluxe Edition), in 2017. He then embarked on the most ambitious project in Scandroid’s history to day, releasing the first half of an epic double album in The Darkness in 2018. The second half, The Light, was released in late 2019 with the complete album, The Darkness and The Light, to follow in 2020. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Scandroid">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
