Formed in late 2006 by Jake Kearsley and Tim Dolan, UK based Immension are a perfect mix of old and new. Mixing old school and modern metal they are a band which doesn't fit into any particular sub genre or trend. Spending the last few years honing their sound and finding the right line up, they are now ready to take their music to the masses.
Its a dangerous game, kill or be killed, and they don't plan on being the latter.. They have just finished recording at the acclaimed Studio Fredman in Sweden with Fredrik Nordstrï¿½m (Arch Enemy, Dimmu Borgir, At The Gates, In Flames)
