Although founded in the late 90s by sibling guitarists Stefan and Uwe Stronks, keyboarder René Grün and drummer Stephan Weitz, Germany based metal band Schattenspieler (which roughly translates into 'Playing the Shadows') was officially born in the year 2000, when after months of casting, finally a suitable vocalist had been found. Singer David J. Esser, who was used to doing only power metal and psychedelic rock, dramatically changed the musical style of the band into Dark Melodic Metal, as they began their songwriting work on a project, which wouldn't be completed for almost five years. During this time, they played many gigs in several big cities throughout Germany and managed to build a huge fan base. In July of 2006, they released their debut album, Lux et Umbra (latin for Light and Shadow).
