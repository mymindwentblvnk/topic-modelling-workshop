In 2012 four well-known Spanish musicians came together to form León Benavente. Luis Rodríguez (guitar), Abraham Boba (voice), César Verdú (drums) and Eduardo Baos (bass). All of them play or have played with recognized Spanish artists: Boba and Rodríguez are members of Nacho Vegas’ band, Baos plays with Tachenko, and Verdú with Schwarz.  The group's name comes from a stretch of road, often traveled by the four musicians, between the towns of León and Benavente.

Their first, eponymous  album was released in February 2013, featuring the single Ánimo, Valiente. The Todos Contra Todos followed in December, featuring three new tracks and a cover of Europa ha muerto by Ilegales. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Le%C3%B3n+Benavente">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
