Satya Graha was born back in 2003, when the two guitarists of the band (cousins), already having worked on some primitive material, started looking for musicians to form an actual band ! Long story short, almost one year later and after a great deal of searching, the band was eventually formed. It maintained the line-up listed below until a couple of months ago (late summer of 2006), when Nikos (Bass) abandoned his post in the band for personal reasons ! However, the band was delighted to meet Xampos who filled the empty position of the bassist since the beginning of 2007. What's "interesting" (in a way) is the fact that the band has been lacking (ever since it was created up till today) a permanent vocalist ! Nevertheless, Andeas Sinigalias was more than eager to fill in for this role and help them give life to their long existing ideas (Thanx a million man) ! Fortunately, this led to their first attempt "TABULA RASA", a kind of a demo/mini album thing that wasn't finished until December of 2005 ! Tabula Rasa is rather a collection of songs written throughout those years, than a proper album. Hence, it represents a mixture of variable musical influences ! At this point, the band is already working on new material (given the fact that along with their brother-bands : Dimeyes and Film noir , they are in posession of their own studio) ! Hopefully the new (full length this time) album will have been recorded around by Christmas of 2007 although there's still a big questionmark on the singer issue. Of course we would be very huppy to get in touch with anyone who has got singing skills, finds our music interesting and would like to give it a try.
