Ticket To Hell came into form after Jacobo disbanded from Mexico´s Antiqua. The 2008 debut release on My Kingdom Music, Man Made Paradise, received excellent acclaim from international press as well as fans, and gained the band a spot in the Extreme Metal Scene.

Two years later comes the newest atomic bomb in the form of “Operation: Crash Course”, which will also be released by My Kingdom Music on June 4th of 2010 worldwide, except in UK, where it will be released on June 7th.

Your neck is about to be destroyed with it’s 8 tracks of pure hate and armageddon. This time the mood is darker, faster and with an in your face brutal production courtesy of Inzonic Music Lab (Morbosidad, Ravager, Disgorge, Hacavitz). Caution, this only appeals to Extreme Metal fans that breed, eat and feed on Death, Black and Thrash Metal. So if you thought Man Made Paradise was brutal, you have yet to hear Operation: Crash Course!!! Kill the posers!!!
