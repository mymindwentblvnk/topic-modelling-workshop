Crawling Death is a young death metal band from Rybnik, Poland. It was formed in 2001 by two musicians- Topor and Tarki. After just a few months their old pal- Metal joined the band as a second guitarist. After a long time of looking for a vocal and a bass player, the band found only the first one, and thaths how Mask took over the microphone. The four composed for almost two years, but being not satisfied of their sound they started to look again for a bass player. At last in the summer of 2003, Slawek joined the band... They started to rearange the songs with full line-up... Unfortunately in the summer of 2004, after an argue with the rest of the guys, Mask was kicked out of the band. After a short period of time Popi (ex- Deneb) took his place over. Unfortunately the adventure with Popi was very short. In December 2004 Crawling Death enters the studio to record their first ever demo supported on vocals by their old friend Wojtas (also Moulded Flesh). But the year after the recordings Wojtas had to leave the country looking for a better life, and he went to England. Almost parallel to Wojtas, Top√≥r left the band for his own reasons. Being in need we asked Muflon (ex Deneb) to use his throat in our band, and that how he joined us. Thanks to Muf, Dajs, our new gutarist jumped into the squad. During the yeras the squad has changed many times, but in 2008 is as follows: Maryj- vocals Azar- guitar Krychu- guitar Kawior- bass Tarki- drums During winter 2007- spring 2008 Crawling Death has recorder it's new album- "New Murder Art", released 11.06.2008 by Let Them Come Prod. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Crawling+Death">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
