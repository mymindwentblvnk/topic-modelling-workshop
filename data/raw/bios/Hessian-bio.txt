1) Dark metalcore band from Ghent, Belgium. (Hessian A.D. on US territory)

From the onset, the combined musical backgrounds of guitarist Levy Seynaeve (Amenra), drummer Tim Bryon (The Black Heart Rebellion), vocalist Bram Coussement and bass player Kenneth Vanhoutte fell effortlessly into place, pushing a sound that was at once pummeling, devouring and empowering across the rural fields where they started rehearsing.

After a well received debut EP, a split 7″ with Amenra, a split LP with Pale Creation on Magic Bullet Records and countless shows throughout Europe, HESSIAN have found a new home with Southern Lord who will unleash the band’s debut album, Manégarmr to the North American masses on April 30th.
