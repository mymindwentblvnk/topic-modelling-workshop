Chuck Wood was a soul artist born in Tyler, Texas who moved to Los Angeles.  He is known to have recorded for Warner Brothers, but his best known track 'Seven Days Too Long' was released on the Roulette label in 1967.  Thought forgotten, the track became popular in the Northern Soul clubs in England nearly a decade later. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Chuck+Wood">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
