Enoria is a Gothic metal band from Switzerland and is way older than one might guess, the band was created in 2003, but despite the rather long life-span the band hasn't been able to create nor publish that much material.

Their first full-lenght saw the light of day in 2010, Enoria, and is to this date the only thing the band has released. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Enoria">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
