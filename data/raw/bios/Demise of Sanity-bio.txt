Demise of Sanity were formed early 2008 in Jersey C.I off the coast of France

Singer/Guitarst Sam Delanoe & Drummer James Andrews started the band after the end of their previous project Absit Omen.

They then asked good friends Yannick Guillemot & Jack De La Haye to join the band on guitar (Yannick) & bass (Jack)

Demise played a few gigs covering such tracks as Metallica's Creeping Death, Orion, Nothing Else Matters, Slayers Seasons In the Abyss and Black Label Society's Suicide Messiah and 1 Orignal track.

Shortly after the bands third gig bassist Jack decided that the band wasn't for him due to upcoming exams so Demise went looking for another bassist.

Good friend Dan stepped up for the job and is now the permenant bassist in the band.


The band have many songs ready to be recorded and played live & will be uploaded when ready. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Demise+Of+Sanity">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
