The melodic "Dies Ater" is an atmospheric black metal band, founded by Nuntius Tristis (vocals & guitar) in autumn â€˜94. Hfound Impurus (drums), who was playing in a small Death-Band before, and Obskur (bass). But the band was not complete and they searched for another guitar player, and Torgrim (lead guitar) did the job.Dies Ater stands for "a black/fatal day". They recorded the Demo called 'Rabenflug' in 1996."Dies Ater" finally signed at the english label Mordgrimm Records.  Ole C. (keyboard) joined the band to help them develop their style. The albums that followed were "Through Weird Woods", their second album, year 2000, mixed by Jens Bachmann. In April 2003 they released the next album, "Chanting Evil". But in June 2003 something dismal happened: Obskur left the band and the gap he left behind was filled by a formidable guitarplayer: Andy of Apokrypha. "Under the black sun"-festival '03 was the first gig "Dies Ater" had with the new formation.Half and year later the band surprised the whole scene with a spectacular release. In November 2004 'Out of the dark' an impressive MCD was presented to the mass, including a cover-version of the same called song from the former Austrian musician Falco, which died in 1998, and besides two new songs and a rerecorded version of "Dethrone the weak mortality" was added. But they are not finished.
