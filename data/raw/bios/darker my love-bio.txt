Darker My Love is a psychedelic rock band based in Los Angeles, California. The band consists of 5 members. Tim Presley, a former member of the band The Nerve Agents and also a visual artist responsible for much of the band's imagery, contributes vocals and guitar. Andy Granelli, formerly a member of both The Nerve Agents and The Distillers, plays drums. They are accompanied by Rob Barbato, who plays bass and shares lead vocal duties with Presley, and Jared "The Sandwich" Everett on rhythm guitar. Will Canzoneri joined the band on organ and clavinet in the latter half of 2006. The group's style is often compared to bands such as Can and My Bloody Valentine.

On 28 August 2007, the band released a 12" 45 rpm split record with Denver-based rock group Moccasin. Darker My Love's contribution is a song called "Hair Decisions," which was recorded at San Francisco's Hyde Street Studios in October 2006. The record was the first release on L.A.-based label IHATEROCKNROLL. In Spring 2006, Presley and Barbato became members of Manchester (U.K.)-based group The Fall, and are both featured prominently on The Fall's 2007 album, Reformation Post TLC.
