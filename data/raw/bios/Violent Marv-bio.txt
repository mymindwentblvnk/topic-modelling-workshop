A metal/hardcore/grindcore band from Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

After several years, many amazing memories and experiences, Marv has been disolved due to irreconcilable differences. There was a fight, it got nasty and 2 members were killed as a result. The remaining members are now doing hard time in a maximum security institution. A new band has been formed behind bars, with the remaining members banging on buckets, playing the mop-handle bass and wailing on the old prison staple, the Harmonica. If the parole hearings in 2011 go alright, expect a tour shortly thereafter. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Violent+Marv">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
