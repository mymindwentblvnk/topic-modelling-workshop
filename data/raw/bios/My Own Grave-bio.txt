My Own Grave was formed by Anders Haren (guitar), Max Bergman (bass) and John Henriksson (drums) in early April 2001. Very soon singer Ramin Farhadian joined the ranks and the debut demo "New path/Same path" was released in time for the first live performance in summer 2001. Later that year additional guitarist Stefan Kihlgren was recruited and "Dissection of a mind" was released in early 2002. This line-up produced yet another demo ("Blood and ashes" 2003) before it was decided that Ramin should be replaced by Mikael "Aron" Aronsson. The line-up change was a recharge for the band and the new material wrote itself. A fourth demo CD was recorded, like its two preceeders, at Studio Domsaga (Sundsvall) and given the title "Progression through deterioration".

Like all earlier releases PTD received only positive reviews and eventually My Own Grave were contacted by Karmageddon Media. The deal was inked in blood in May 2004 and in September the same year My Own Grave entered Studio Necromorbus (Stockholm) with producer Vidar Wiklund (Diabolical) to record the debut album "Unleash".
