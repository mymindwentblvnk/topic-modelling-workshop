Atheria is a  6-piece progressive metal/hardcore band from Enfield, CT, United States of America. The band started out with Shalin Shah (guitars), Matt Ares (guitars), and Ryan Veilleux (drums), for a few months and soon came the addition of Justin Rodzen (bass) and Kris Fluckiger (keys). They went on as mainly an instrumental band for over a year until a vocalist was founded in Brendan Bowidas.  Atheria recorded their first EP during the spring/summer of 2008. In early 2009, vocalist Brendan Bowidas was replaced with Pete Davenport and the band is currently finishing up a couple songs so they can go record their first full-length. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Atheria">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
