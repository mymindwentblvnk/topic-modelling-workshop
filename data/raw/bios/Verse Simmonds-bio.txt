Verse Simmonds was born in Puerto Rico and raised in the Virgin Islands. Coming up in the streets was an unfortunate circumstance and many nights going to bed hungry, his only solace was writing music. As a teenager Verse relocated to Florida where he met Shama Joseph, someone with a familiar background who also shared the same love for music. The two decided to form a production/songwriting team "The Jugganauts". Their production style was so unique they quickly scored a job producing an independent LP in Los Angeles. While there, they caught the attention of Genuine Music Group ( a singer/songwriter/artist management company) the team was offered their first major production assignment for an 18 year old female hip-hop artist AK Sent.

Although his focus has been on producing and songwriting for others, VERSE'S passion to perform his own original music has always been something he's wanted to accomplish. Under the guidance of Ray Daniels of Raydar Management ( A&R for Interscope) Mark Barnes of Cloud 9 Group VERSE'S dreams of being the "feature" has come into focus. Laced with an artillery of hits as well as his vast knowledge of the mechanics of music production, landing a major deal with Super Producer Rodney "Darkchild" Jerkins/Interscope is only one piece of the kaliedoscope. This dynamic artist facets of creativity, delivery, and killer songwriting skills, VERSE is bringin his sound to the masses, which is a welcoming breath of fresh air to all who listens. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Verse+Simmonds">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
