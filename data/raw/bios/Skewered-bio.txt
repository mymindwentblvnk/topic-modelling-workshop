2003, Dublin; Necrosis formed, playing death metal in the vein of Cannibal Corpse and Deicide. The line-up consisting of Mark Dolan (vocals), Luke Geoghegan (guitar), Freddy Walsh (guitar) and Salvador Maguire (bass). There was no steady drummer until 2005, when Conor McClancey joined.

After a string of successful gigs and then a demo recording in 2006, Conor left the band. After months of searching for a skinsman, Freddy put down his guitar and stepped behind the kit. Later in 2006, Luke left the band. The band, with powerful drive, searched for a new guitarist, which led to Andy Sweeney (Pulverise, ex-Immersed in Dread) to enter the fold in November of that year.

Upon Andy's joining, Skewered formed and the band went in a new musical direction. Homegrown Brutality, an old demo of Necrosis material was released in 2006 to mixed reviews. After 2 years of writing, rehearsing and gigging, the band entered the studio to record the first of the new material. With a new and evolved sound, the release of a 4 track promo was welcomed with great reviews.

Skewered recorded their debut full-length in September, 2010. Which was followed with Freddy's departure in December of that year due to other commitments. Jazzer (Pogrom, Blood Soaked) joined in early 2011 as their new drummer.

The debut album was officially released in early 2012 on Inherited Suffering Records & Anopsys Records. The album launch being the final show with original bassist, Sal. Numerous other bassists were auditioned, leading to Scott Carlin joining the fold along with Dave Coyne (Guttrench) joining as guitarist and additional vocalist. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Skewered">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
