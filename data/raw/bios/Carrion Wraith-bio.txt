Carrion Wraith - The most conceptually arced of Monarque's projects is based around the Carrion Wraith, a character spreading rot and darkness through his wintry forests. The musical conception and recording of the album was limited to a 7 day period of spontaneous writing, meaning the entire thing is almost a free solo jam session with a lot of parts conceived and set down on first take. It is totally devotional Burzum worship interspersed with the samples of natural environments, drilling it's naturalistic point home pretty hard through the sound of birdsong, riverbanks and of course forests. Beautifully composed drum patterns shift through tempos and underlay the textural guitar work with a perfect balance of elegance, aggression and hypnotic momentum. That combination is underpinned by basslines that really get the grooves moving and throw some uncharacteristic but hugely effective shapes - especially in Vers Une Nouvelle Ã¨re.  the whole record sounds like someone rapt in their own world with the absolute peaks in performance committed to tape. The spontaneity is further embodied in the delivery of the lyrics which alternate across the hour long record in both French and English. 

The standout out recording of all Monarque's projects (Blackwind, Monarque, Sui Caedere and Carrion Wraith), it is pure unpolished cold Northern trance as it was always intended. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Carrion+Wraith">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
