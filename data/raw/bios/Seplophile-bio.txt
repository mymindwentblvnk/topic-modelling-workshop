Seplophile is an independent/unsigned death metal band from Buffalo, NY. Formed in January 2010, Seplophile came together in an effort to create something that could give the once dominant Buffalo Death Metal scene a righteous kick in the ass. Mixing musical prowess with atavistic brutality, Seplophile is dedicated to exploring the darkest depths of death metal in order to achieve an atmosphere that is missing in most modern extreme music. Fast and brutal, loose and lethal, death metal prevails! 

Members are:
Colin Winkelman - Vocals
Greg DiPasquale - Guitars
Matthew Backlas - Guitars
Shawn Gomez - Bass
Allen Malkiewicz- Drums
