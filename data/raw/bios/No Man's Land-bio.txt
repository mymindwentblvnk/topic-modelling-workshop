There is more than one artist with this name:
1) Russian gothic rock band.

2) Hungarian Rock Band
No Man's Land was formed in 2003 Budapest, Hungary. The sound of the band was always based on the idea of playing pure and simple rock music. You can see it from the instruments they use, the songs they write, and the way they play. Their music is influenced by the biggest rock legends, from the 60's up to the present ones. Out of the four band members of No Man's Land, three are brothers, and the fourth is just like a brother to them. They have been playing together for about ten years in different bands, when in 2003 No Man's Land was born. Since then the band went through several changes but these four guys still find their enjoyment in their music together and write new songs that they present on their concert.

Band members:
Aron Hajba - music, guitars, lead singer
Miklos Bellak - Guitars, vocals
Imre Hajba - Bass, vocals
Laszlo Hajba - Drums
