Cynicism was founded as a side project to the other bands of the project-leader Lindwurm. In search of his own musical identity Cynicism underwent several changes. But with time the essential and representative elements were more and more solidified.

Today there are brutal riffs, thundering drums, weird vocals and an increasing amount of electronical elements which shape the sound of Cynicism.

The first outcome of the development of Cynicism is the Mini-CD „The Path of Self-Sacrificing Destruction“. All songs are conceptionally connected and empathize the downfall of a mentally shattered person. Within five chapters the listener experiences the realisation, the denial, the distress and finally the abyssal fall without standing a chance of return. It is left to the imagination of the listener what slowly destroys the protagonist.
The morbid spirit of the lyrics is underlined by the music. „The Path of Self-Sacrificing Destruction“ is conceived as a Gothic Metal-Album, influenced by bands like Paradise Lost, but also the most sombre moments of Nevermore or Hypocrisy.

„The Path of Self-Sacrificing Destruction“ is available as free download including the CD-artwork via the project-homepage. The whole CD was recorded by the project-leader himself in his own Grotesque Studios.

Now in 2008 it is time for the next step. The new record "A Taste of Hate" shreds the listener away on an unbelievable and incomparable musical rollercoaster-ride. An energetic and hybrid mixture of Death, Thrash and Doom Metal explodes within each song and eats itself into the auditory canals. And best of all: this killer album is once again available as a free download!
