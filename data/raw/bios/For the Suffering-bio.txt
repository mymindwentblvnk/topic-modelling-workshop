No trends, no gimmicks, no bulls**t. For the Suffering has crafted their own style of melodic yet brutal American metal without falling prey to weak and passing trends. Dominating the Eastern New Mexico/West Texas scene since 2003. 

The band released itâ€™s debut self titled album in early 2009 through Crash Music Inc./EMI.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/For+The+Suffering">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
