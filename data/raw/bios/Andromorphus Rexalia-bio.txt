Joseph Lusciano (ex-Immortal Flesh) [guitar, bass] and Wilson Rair√°n of Animals Killing People (Ex-Purulent, Copremesis) [drums], decide to get together and create Andromorphus Rexalia, with the purpose of creating something more brutal and faster to what they've done up to date. Paulo Paguntalan of Copremesis [vocals] joins the band for the recording of their CD and to play a couple of live shows. ANDROMORPHUS REXALIA enters the studio to record the material created for their CD "Cosmic Collision Into The Fifth Dimension", released in 2010. After this Paulo leaves the band due to lack of time. Ralph Ortiz (ex-Immortal Flesh, Disembowel) joins the band on vocals and Javier Duque (Carnal) on bass & backing vocals, to complete the first full Andromorphus Rexalia line-up and play some shows. Afterwards Javier leaves the band due to alcohol- and drug-related problems. Paulo rejoins the band, and Ammo Diaz (Humanity Falls, Animals Killing People) is added as a second vocalist. This line-up records the "Phylum Morph-Apokalupsis" split-EP with Animals Killing People which is released in 2012. 

Currently, the line-up of the band consists of Wilson on drums and Joseph on guitar and bass, with Ammo as the vocalist. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Andromorphus+Rexalia">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
