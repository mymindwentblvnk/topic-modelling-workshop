Plastic Violins Of Darkness is a one-man army from Leipzig with a self-released debut of atmospheric, stoner infused space rock that, though dark and heavy, escapes gravity and any hints of oppressiveness with a wide-open vista of sounds. Taking leads from 90s electronic ambient and post-industrial music, Plastic Violins Of Darkness also tips its hat to metal without relying on the repetitive riff. Cuts like the cascading Triskaidekaphobia offer up the requisite grind, but going for the patient slow-burn gives Plastic Violins Of Darkness a good dose of enigmatic expanse that keeps it free-floating without taking away from the heft. Full of texture and ‘unavoidable artificial aspects,’ Plastic Violins Of Darkness keeps the journey moving forward and swinging wide without meandering into mopey formlessness. With flight times between 12 and 20+ minutes, it would be easy to veer off into the void and lose your way—and there is much in Plastic Violins Of Darkness to make you feel unanchored and untethered—but our pilot keeps purpose in mind as the tracts of space go by. All build and elongate, some slowly whiplashing back into themselves with a rubbery and fat thickness that gives the listener maximum chewing satisfaction.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Plastic+Violins+Of+Darkness">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
