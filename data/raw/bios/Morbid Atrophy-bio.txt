Morbid Atrophy was created early in 2011 after Sacha left black metal band, Throes, which he played drums in. Having mainly been a vocalist (Kachana, Craniosacral, Irony Of Christ) and guitarist (Irony Of Christ), he decided to start a solo project to fulfill his need to make music while he waits to join a band on vocals. Morbid Atrophy is a mix of metal styles with short tracks. The lyrical content focuses on real ale. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Morbid+Atrophy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
