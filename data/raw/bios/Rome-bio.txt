1) ROME is a Luxembourgish neofolk act founded in late 2005 as the main output for the songs of Jerome Reuter and was joined by co-producer Patrick Damiani as official member in early 2008. ROME signed to the Swedish label CMI in 2006 to release an EP titled "Berlin" (June 2006) and the albums "Nera" (November 2006), "Confessions d'un voleur d'ames" (April 2007), "Masse Mensch Material" (March 2008). In 2009 ROME got signed to the german label Trisol and released the EP "To Die Among Strangers" (May 2009) and the album "Flowers From Exile" (June 2009). 
In their earlier work ROME mixes influences of Industrial and Neofolk with Experimental and Electronic Pop. The traditions of (French) Chanson and (American) Folk are becoming more and more influential in their current work. In 2009 violin player Nikos Mavridis officially joined the band to further contribute to the creation of their unique sound, which they themselves refer to as Chanson Noir. Nikos left the band in late 2010 to answer the army's call and Patrick found himself more and more tied up in the work for his own professional recording studio in Germany. ROME released the EP "L'assassin" in early 2010, shortly before going into hiatus, followed by the full length "Nos chants perdus". In 2011, Jerome, the project's only real flag-bearer, recorded and released the trilogy "Die Aesthetik Der Herrschaftsfreiheit" (Trisol) and has taken up touring again with his new band mates Patrick Kleinbauer, Eric Emmel and Tom Luciani. ROME's lyrics often deal with anarchism and are demanding freedom and equal rights for all people on earth.
