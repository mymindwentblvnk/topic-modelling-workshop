Formed in 1991 these guys from Ukraine play Death/Doom with a lot of acoustic/folk (Russian/Ukrainean) intermezzos. Very melancholic music that uses both grunts/screams and clean male vocals. She Cries can be a little low on the metal side of the metal to non-metal ratio in some songs. Given their quality, it is rather strange that they are so unknown, as they will probably appeal to most My Dying Bride fans (similar style, but no clone).  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/She+Cries">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
