Sacrificial was formed in 1990 by the brothers Kr√¶n and Lukas Meier. In the beginning the band was inspired by death metal bands like Morgoth. Later on the inspirations would be more thrash oriented, but always accompanied by a death metal-esque edge. In the span of their career they put three albums (Forever Entangled, 1993. Erect:Eloquent:Extinct, 2000 and AutoHate, 2002) and out a buttload of demos. The band split up in 2008. 
In 2011, most of the Forever Entangled-lineup reunited to do a few gigs. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sacrificial">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
