Scorpions is a rock band from Hannover, Germany that was formed in 1965. Internationally acclaimed for their 1984 rock anthem "Rock You Like a Hurricane" as well as other popular singles such as "Big City Nights", "No One Like You", "Send Me an Angel", "Still Loving You", and "Wind of Change", the band has sold over 100 million records worldwide. Along with metal contemporaries such as Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Metallica, Whitesnake, and others, Scorpions is one of the most successful acts in heavy metal and hard rock in history as well as, by far, the most successful German rock band in the U.K. and the U.S.

Rudolf Schenker, the band's rhythm guitarist, once explained in an interview with Songfacts that: "In the beginning of our career, we had a problem in Germany because nobody expects a German band to play rock music. With rock music, there are more bands from England or America, which are more exotic than the Scorpions, who are from Germany. But when we went to America in '79, we became the exotic ones. They said, 'Hey, what kind of crazy guys are these?' We were already exotic, with a different view, and we also play our Rock music with a little bit of an ethnic touch. You'll notice that Americans come from the blues side, whereas we come from the classical side, which is different." 

Formation and early history (1965-1973) 

Young German musician Rudolf Schenker set out to find his way in music in 1965. At first, his group was a school-kid outfit with British invasion influences, featuring Schenker himself on vocals. Things began to come together in 1969 when Schenker's younger brother Michael and vocalist Klaus Meine joined the band. In 1972, the rock group recorded and released their debut album, titled 'Lonesome Crow', with Lothar Heimberg on bass and Wolfgang Dziony on drums. The album showcased a group that still was finding its voice lyrically and in style terms, thus picking up a muted reaction commercially. During the related tour for the album, Scorpions opened for up-and-coming British heavy metal outfit UFO. At the end of the tour, the members of UFO offered Michael Schenker the lead guitar job; the offer proved so tantalizing that he soon accepted. Musician Uli Jon Roth ended up being called in temporarily to finish off the tour. 

The departure of Michael Schenker led to Scorpions as a band going on hiatus. In 1973, Roth, a friend of the Schenker brothers serving in a band called Dawn Road, turned down the role as lead guitarist in Scorpions after Michael Schenker's departure. Yet Roth invited Rudolf Schenker to join his own band instead. With a line-up established of Roth, Schenker, and Francis Buchholz (bass), Achim Kirschning (keyboards), and Jurgen Rosenthal (drums), Dawn Road felt primed for something huge. Roth even managed to get Klaus Meine to join the outfit before too long. Finally, even the "Scorpions" name came back as the guys wanted to build on the name's past fame in the German hard rock scene. 
 
Rise to widespread popularity (1974-1978) 

In 1974, the new line-up of Scorpions released an album titled 'Fly to the Rainbow'. The release proved considerably more successful than their former album, with songs such as "Speedy's Coming" and the title track establishing the band's shift more and more away from psychedelic rock and towards aggressive, heavy-sounding music. Though sadly possessing what has been regarded as one of the worst album covers of all time, 'Fly to the Rainbow' has additionally earned critical praise over the years. Achim Kirschning decided to leave after the recording came out for other opportunities, but he subsequently guested on keyboards for the next two albums.

+ Soon after, JÃ¼rgen Rosenthal had to leave as he was being drafted into the army, and was replaced by a Belgian drummer, Rudy Lenners. He later joined German progressive rock band called Eloy in 1976 and recorded three albums with them. It wasn't until the following year that the band hit their stride with the release of In Trance. In Trance marked the beginning of Scorpions' long collaboration with German producer Dieter Dierks. The album was a huge step forward for Scorpions and firmly established their hard rock formula, while at the same time garnering a substantial fan base, both at home and abroad.  
  +  
  + In 1976, Scorpions released Virgin Killer. The album's cover, which featured a fully nude prepubescent girl, brought the band considerable criticism and was ultimately pulled or replaced in several countries. In spite of the controversy - lead singer Klaus Meine even expressed shock - the album garnered significant praise from critics and fans alike. The following year, Rudy Lenners resigned due to health reasons and was replaced by Herman Rarebell. 
  +  
  + The follow-up to Virgin Killer, Taken by Force, was the first Scorpions record to be aggressively promoted in the United States. The album's single, "Steamrock Fever", was added to some of RCA's radio promotional records. Roth was not happy with the label's efforts and the commercial direction the band was taking. Although he performed on the band's Japan tour, he departed to form his own band, Electric Sun prior to the release of the resultant double live album Tokyo Tapes. Tokyo Tapes was released in the US and Europe six months after its Japanese release. By that time in mid 1978, Scorpions recruited new guitarist Matthias Jabs. 
  +  
  + Commercial success and height of popularity (1979-1990) 
  +  
  + Following the addition of Jabs, Scorpions left RCA for Mercury Records to record their next album. Just weeks after being evicted from UFO for his alcohol abuse, Michael Schenker also returned to the group for a short period during the recordings of the album. The result was Lovedrive. Containing such fan favorites as "Loving You Sunday Morning", "Holiday" and the instrumental "Coast to Coast", the "Scorpions formula" of hard rock songs mixed in with melodic ballads was firmly cemented. Lovedrive peaked at #55 on the US charts proving that Scorpions were gathering an international following. After the completion and release of the album, the band decided to retain Michael in the band, thus forcing Matthias Jabs to leave. But after a few weeks of the tour, Michael, still coping with alcoholism, kept missing a few gigs and Matthias Jabs was brought back to fill in for him on those occasions when he couldn't perform. In April 1979, during their tour in France, Matthias Jabs was brought in permanently to replace Michael Schenker. 
  +  
  + In 1980, the band released Animal Magnetism, again with a provocative cover showing a girl kneeling in front of a man's crotch. While Animal Magnetism contained classics such as "The Zoo" and "Make It Real", it was a critical disappointment when compared with Lovedrive.  
  +  
  + The band then began working on their next album. Blackout was released in 1982 and quickly became the band's best selling to date, eventually going platinum. Blackout spawned three hit singles: "Dynamite," "Blackout" and "No One Like You". 
  +  
  + It was not until 1984 and the release of Love at First Sting that the band finally cemented their status as rock superstars. Propelled by the single "Rock You Like a Hurricane", Love at First Sting went up the charts and went double platinum a few months after its release. MTV gave the album's videos "Rock You Like a Hurricane", "Bad Boys Running Wild", "Big City Nights", and the power ballad "Still Loving You" significant airtime, greatly contributing to the album's success. 
  +  
  + The band toured extensively behind Love at First Sting and decided to record and release their second live album, World Wide Live. Recorded over a year long period and released at the height of their popularity, the album was another success for the band, peaking at #17 on the charts. 
  +  
  + After their extensive world tours, the band finally returned to the studio to record Savage Amusement. Released in 1988, four years after their previous studio album, Savage Amusement represented a more polished pop sound similar to the style Def Leppard had found success with.  
  +  
  + On the Savage Amusement tour in '88, Scorpions became only the second Western group to play in the Soviet Union (the first being Uriah Heep in December 1987), with a performance in Leningrad. The following year the band returned to perform at the Moscow Music Peace Festival. 
  +  
  + Wishing to distance themselves from the Savage Amusement style, the band separated from their long-time producer and "Sixth Scorpion," Dieter Dierks, ultimately replacing him with Keith Olsen when they returned to the studio in 1990. Crazy World was released that same year and displayed a less polished sound. The album was a hit, propelled in large part by the massive success of the ballad "Wind of Change".  
  +  
  + Later days (1991-present) 
  +  
  + After the release of Crazy World Francis Buchholz, the band's long-serving bassist, left the group. Replacing him was Ralph Rieckermann who handled bass duties until 2002.  
  +  
  + In 1993 Scorpions released Face the Heat. For the recording process, Scorpions brought in producer Bruce Fairbairn. The album's sound was more metallic than melodic. Face the Heat was a moderate success. 
  +  
  + In 1995, a new live album, Live Bites, was produced. The disc documented live performances from their Savage Amusement Tour in 1988, all the way through the Face the Heat Tour in 1994. While the album had a much cleaner sound in comparison to their best-selling live album, World Wide Live, it was not as successful. 
  +  
  + Prior to recording their 13th studio album, 1996's Pure Instinct, drummer Herman Rarebell left the band to set up a recording company. Curt Cress and Pitty Hecht took charge of the drumsticks for the album before James Kottak took over permanently.  
  +  
  + 1999 saw the release of Eye II Eye and a significant change in the band's style, mixing in elements of pop and techno. While the album was slickly produced, fans were unsure what to make of the band, responding negatively to almost everything from pop-soul backup singers to the electronic drums present on several songs. The video to the album's first European single, "To Be No. 1", featured a Monica Lewinsky lookalike which did little to improve its popularity. 
  +  
  + The following year Scorpions had a fairly successful collaboration with the Berlin Philharmonic that resulted in a 10-song album named Moment of Glory. The album went a long way towards rebuilding the band's reputation after the harsh criticism of Eye II Eye.  
  +  
  + In 2001, Scorpions released Acoustica, a live unplugged album featuring acoustic reworkings of the band's biggest hits, plus new tracks. While appreciated by fans, the lack of a new studio album was frustrating to some, and Acoustica did little to return the band to the spotlight. 
  +  
  + In 2004, the band released Unbreakable, an album that was hailed by critics as a long awaited return to form. The album was the heaviest the band had released since Face the Heat, and fans responded well to tracks such as "New Generation", "Love 'em or Leave 'em" and "Deep and Dark". Whether a result of poor promotion by the band's label or the long time between studio releases, Unbreakable received little airplay and did not chart. Scorpions toured extensively behind the album, and played as special guests with Judas Priest during the 2005 British tour. 
  +  
  + In early 2006, Scorpions released the DVD 1 Night in Vienna that included 14 live tracks and a complete rockumentary.  
  +  
  + In May of 2007, Scorpions released Humanity - Hour 1 in Europe. Humanity - Hour 1 became available in the U.S. on August 28, 2007 on New Door Records, entering the Billboard charts at number #63.

  + 24 JANUARY 2010 
  + Scorpions announce retirement. 
  + it was always our pleasure, our purpose in life, our passion and we 
  + were fortunate enough to make music for you - whether it was live on 
  + stage or in the studio, creating new songs.  
  +  
  + While we were working on our album these past few months, we could 
  + literally feel how powerful and creative our work was - and how much 
  + fun we were still having, in the process. But there was also something 
  + else: We want to end the Scorpion's extraordinary career on a high 
  + note. We are extremely grateful for the fact that we still have the 
  + same passion for music we've always had since the beginning. This is 
  + why, especially now, we agree we have reached the end of the road. We 
  + finish our career with an album we consider to be one of the best we 
  + have ever recorded and with a tour that will start in our home country 
  + Germany and take us to five different continents over the next few 
  + years.  
  +  
  + We want you, our fans, to be the first to know about this. Thank you 
  + for your never-ending support throughout the years!  
  +  
  + We uploaded the very first snippets from our new album on our website 
  + www.the-scorpions.com for you.  
  +  
  + And now. let's get the party started and get ready for a "Sting in the 
  + Tail"!  
  +  
  + See you on the world tour,  
  +  
  + Yours
