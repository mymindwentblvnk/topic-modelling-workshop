Linda Perhacs is an American psychedelic folk singer-songwriter, who released her debut album "Parallelograms" in 1970 to scant notice or sales. The album was rediscovered by record enthusiasts and grew in popularity with the rise of the New Weird America movement and the Internet. It was reissued on CD and 2-LP in 2005, and again in 2008.

Native of Mill Valley, California, United States, Linda Perhacs spent many years away from the music industry (mostly spent as dental technician). Her songs have been featured in soundtracks to many films, most recently and notably in "Daft Punk's Electroma". Perhacs also sang backing vocals on "Freely" from Devendra Banhart's "Smokey Rolls Down Thunder Canyon" and features in Prefuse 73's track "Rain Edit Interlude" from the album "Surrounded by Silence".

In December 2013, Asthmatic Kitty Records announced the March 2014 release of Perhacs' second record The Soul of All Natural Things. The album was recorded in 2012 and 2013 with co-producers Fernando Perdomo and Chris Price. Other collaborators on the album include Julia Holter and Ramona Gonzalez of Nite Jewel. The Soul of All Natural Things was released on March 4, 2014.
