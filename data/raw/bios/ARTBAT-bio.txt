Artur and Batish are two friends who have risen from Kyiv’s underground to become one of the most in demand acts on the international circuit. It is a pure passion for the music that has got them there, as well as their own unique sense of driving, powerful and melodic house and techno. 2019 was a standout year for this pair, who were Mixmag Stars of the Year as well as being Beatport’s overall Number 1 best selling artists after an unbeatable string of Number 1 singles and the Ibiza DJ Awards - Breakthrough Artist Of The Year! It was only a few years ago back in 2015 that the pair made their first big impression with ‘Mandrake’ on Definition Music getting high profile support from Richie Hawtin and many more. From there they didn't look back and continued to subtly evolve their sound with the likes of ‘Uplift’ on Diynamic Music and ‘Tabu’ on fryhide showing off their masterful take on melody. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/ARTBAT">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
