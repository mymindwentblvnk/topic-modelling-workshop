A Walk With the Wicked is a death metal band from Cape Town, South Africa.

Started in late 2007, and bursting on to the scene in early 2008; the band has risen to colossal proportions in the Cape Town scene, headlining major metal festivals and destroying all opposition with it's crushing, yet groove-laden riffs.

Taking their musical inspiration from death metal heavyweights like Bloodbath, Cannibal Corpse, Dismember and Entombed; and lyrically re-telling some of mankind's most twisted, violent moments, the band creates a rich, textured whirlwind of noise that is as destructive as it is melodically charged!

2009 saw the band enter the studio with Dean Bailey (Sabretooth, Marching Dead, ex-The Horror Cast) to record their 6-track, debut EP. The album is set to be mastered by David Castillo (Bloodbath, Katatonia]) in Stockholm, Sweden and released by the middle of 2010. The end of the year also saw the band part with their bassist, Justin Bedford, due to life circumstances. His position was quickly filled by Tim Liebbrandt who has ensured that the band has not skipped a beat in their onslaught!

A Walk With the Wicked's motto is "Uncompromising Death Metal"; defying trends, breaking boundaries and deliberately avoiding the cliches that plague the genre, the band has carved out a bloody, gore-soaked niche in the Cape Town scene and now has its sights set firmly on the rest of South Africa and on to foreign shores!!

Band:
Rory Molyneux - Vocals
Ian Robbins - Guitar
Matt Howard-Tripp - Guitar
