Warish is a sludgy punk band fronted by Riley Hawk (Tony Hawk's son).
Imagine if Incesticide era Nirvana were crossed with Static Age era Misfits. Youâ€™d have sinister low budget horror rock with a visceral, twisted weirdness and bludgeoning riffs. Some might call it nightmarish, we call it Warish.
