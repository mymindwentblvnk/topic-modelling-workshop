The band Demon Dagger was formed in Braga, Portugal, by the brothers Vítor Carvalho (guitars) and Miguel Carvalho (drums).
In 1996 they had their first live appearances and in October of the same year, they recorded their first demo-tape with homonymous title. In October of the following year the band recorded the demo “Frenzy Wraith” while a formation change happened with the entrance of the new bass player José Figueiredo. This new demo-tape, released in 1998, was acclaimed by the specialized magazine Prómusica as the best demo of the year. Afterwards, the independent label Recital Records signed the band. By the end of 1999, "Aftershock", the first album, was released.
Two years later (2001) new changes happened in the band: Pedro Mendes and José Figueiredo left and were replaced by Joca (vocals) and Marco Alves (bass). With this new formation they recorded the version "Big Liar" for the Tarantula tribute CD.
In 2002 Demon Dagger recorded its second CD, "Inanna Ishtar" in the studios Casa de Tolos, and this new work was released in 2003. Then in 2004 the band participated in the compilation CD " À Sombra de Deus Vol:III" with the new theme "Away", being the last participation of the singer Joca with Demon Dagger, which was replaced by Shore. With the new singer they recorded the cover "Anarquista Duval" for the tribute CD of Mão Morta (to be released). Later, Marco Alves was replaced by Paulo Chanoca (bass). Right now the band is preparing their third album, with a new singer - Litos. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Demon+Dagger">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
