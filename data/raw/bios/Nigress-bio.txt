Nigress is the old name for the musical project that was formed in the Winter of 2005 by Ominiun and Strevahn, now named 'Amaurosis'. We write metal that we personally feel blows the shit out of most of the 'true' black metal bands. Not interested in being the 'grimmest' or most 'necro' band. Just interested in writing music good music.

The first Nigress recordings were the product of a cider-fuelled weekend of improvisational Black Metal jamming and was the foundation of the progression of the band to more serious writing. Since the aforementioned recordings, Nigress has evolved into a full-project for which the two founding members are constantly writing new music. 

But with a new name came a new vision, and work on the first release has taken many different turns. However, work on the album is finally going forwards and with recording being resumed it won't be long until it is ready.
