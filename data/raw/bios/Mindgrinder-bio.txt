MindGrinder are a Norwegian Death Metal band with some Black Metal influence. Their music also has a strong machine-like Industrial feel mostly due to the tightness and rigidness of their song composition, and the occassional use of synth. Their style of music can be likened to that of fellow Norwegian Death / Black Metallers, Zyklon in many regards.

In 2004 they released their first full-length album titled MindTech.
In 2005 the follow up Riot Detonator was released.

They have released two music videos so far, Fire & Equanimity (from MindTech) and Obligation To Prevail (from Riot Detonator).

Current line-up (as of 2008):

Cosmocrator – Bass, Vocals, Programming

Nitrous – Lead-guitar

Titan – Lead-guitar

Battery -Nex  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/MindGrinder">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
