Q Lazzarus was an American female lead singer. She is known for having a husky bass voice not unlike Kathleen Turner. She is most famously known as a one hit wonder for the song, "Goodbye Horses," which can be heard in the 1990 thriller, 'Silence of the Lambs.' 

Before she was discovered as a singer, she worked as a taxi driver in New York City. 
The band dissolved at some point before 1996. Apart from Q, Mark Berrett and songwriter William Garvey, nothing is known about the other band members. 

Update 12th August 2018
Since Q Lazzarus vanished from the music scene sometime in the mid-1990s, there has been speculation about her disappearance and whether she was even still alive. One recent article on Dazed (17th April 2018) discussed  the ideas that she was involved in bad relationships or with drugs: -

In an ongoing effort to discover what had happened to the singer, another musician (Kelsey Zimmerman) had been searching for any information and posting on the net for leads as to the whereabouts of Q. 
In the last few days (as of this update), she was contacted by a woman who claimed to be Q Lazzarus and provided some information that helped Kelsey track down the probable fate of Q.
