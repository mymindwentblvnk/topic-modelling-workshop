As a huge KISS fan Lars started playing guitar at the age of 13, Ace Frehley being his main motivation/reason for picking up the instrument.

Soon his interest for Hard Rock and Metal grew and he started playing in a Speed Metal band mainly doing covers of popular Metal bands.

When he was about 17-18 Lars got interested in Jazz. Then it was mainly Wes Montgomery who caught his attention and soon Joe Pass, Charlie Parker, Bill Evans and John Coltrane were among his favorite jazz musicians.

After spending some years playing mainly Jazz, Lars returned to his roots and got fascinated by the extended range of 7 string guitars.

Currently he plays mostly instrumental progressive metal and has released his first EP titled 'Sonic Sketches'.
