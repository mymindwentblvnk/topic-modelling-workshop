While citing Botch, Godflesh and Gorguts as large influences, Bridge Burner's tar-doused sound seems a far and unique fling away from these three. 

New record Null Apostle forces listeners into a thick mire of deep ear-shattering tones, fluctuating between heavy rhythm and grind driven riffs – never relaxing for a second.

Null Apostle wastes no time in cementing itself as a strong contender for metal album of the year. The sheer musical diversity of the record spans across genres like black metal, math, crust punk and more, coming together like a Frankenstein’s monster of aggressive music. It’s truly one of the most challenging, evil sounding releases of 2018. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bridge+Burner">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
