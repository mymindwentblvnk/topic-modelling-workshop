MYRKVEDR is a viking metal band from Gothenburg which was founded in january 2010 by HAGAL, ASKEBLOSS and ROK.
The bands name comes from the old norse language and means "Dark Forest" which refers to the forest in the nordic mythology that acts as a border between Asgaard and Muspelheim. 
The trio wrote their first material and began searching for a drummer and found GURKAN. Unfortunatly GURKAN had to leave because of personal reasons a few months later, so the band had a number of auditions until finally THURISAZ became their permanent drummer in May that same year.
In early 2011 HAGAL decided to stop playing the guitar to fully concentrate on singing so the band had an audition and Jakob Lund entered the band as guitarist, and did so just in time to be able to play on the bands first demo-record "Tryms Kväde". 
In the summer that year the band was approached by RUNAR, whos last band named TRUDGELMER just had been laid on ice, and asked if the band would be interested in his services as a flutist.
Around the same time as RUNAR joined the band, Jakob quit the band because of personal differences, and was later replaced by SUMBL in early 2012. 
With SUMBL's and RUNAR's additions to the songwriting, the band shifted focus from Black/Death to more of a Viking/Folk sound.
In late 2014, RUNAR left the band to focus on his sideproject FROSTRIT instead.
MYRKVEDR has been recognized as one of Gothenburgs best and heaviest folkmetal bands.
