Totemo (Rotem Or) comes from Tel Aviv. "I wake up in a room, the sun is shining but it's raining outside. There's a record playing in the background, I can't quite put my finger on it, a subtle voice attracts me.
It sounds like something that has frozen in 95' and is now melting into life and into my ears.
This Trip-Pop dream is heavy so why do I feel so light?"
