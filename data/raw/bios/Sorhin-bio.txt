Swedish black metal band formed early 1993 in Borlänge. As a strong entity in the raw black metal sound, much of the work is violent and relentless, though very atmospheric and melodic as well.

Shamaatae of Arckanum performed drums until 1995 and was succeeded by Zathanel for his work with Setherial until 2000.

Since the leave of Zathanel, Eparygon and Mikael continue as a two-piece presently but have not surfaced information or work since 2002.
