Formed in Middlesbrough, UK  formed in 2001 and disbanded in July 2013, then reformed in 2019 under the name An Axis of Perdition.

The Axis of Perdition's output comprises black metal experimentation with industrial music and dark ambient textures. The Axis of Perdition's debut album decreed that "Axis of Perdition plays something there isn't words for yet (exclusively)".

Their sound is primarily based on distorted guitars, with black metal vocals, programmed drums, and discordant sound effects including screams and static. The black metal aspects of the music are digitally distorted, interspersed with atmospheric soundscapes formed by synthesizers and field recordings. The Axis of Perdition's tracks tend to feature shifting free-form arrangements that lack a typical verse-chorus structure and tend toward lengthiness (one such track, from Deleted Scenes from the Transition Hospital, is over twelve minutes long).

Tapping inspiration from H. P. Lovecraft, Ramsey Campbell and the Silent Hill games (their EP Physical Illucinations in the Sewer of Xuchilbara is named for the dark deity in the games) as well themes of urban decay and mental illness, The Axis of Perdition are often compared to groups like Anaal Nathrakh and Blut aus Nord for their similar grim, urban industrial metal aesthetics. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Axis+of+Perdition">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
