Bitches Sin were a heavy metal band, based in Cumbria, England, and formed around 1980. After several changes, the definitive line-up of Ian Toomey, Pete Toomey, Frank Quegan, Billy Knowles and Mike Frazer, came together. This culminated in the 'Invaders' album, released in 1986. The band originally split circa 1987 as Ian Toomey's Flashpoint side-project became his primary concern, and brother Pete moved to Australia.

However, following a meeting with Grammy-nominated producer Chris Tsangarides (Judas Priest, Thin Lizzy, Anvil), Ian was persuaded to re-initiate the band re-recruiting vocalist Tony Tomkinson along with Tsangarides himself for 2008's UDUVUDU.
