Desert Sin was formed in 2000. It took almost a year until the first stable lineup was established: Sandro (lead vocals, guitars), Rainer (bass, backing vocals), Roman ( keyboards, backing vocals, programming) Harry (drums). 
After several experiments the band found the musical base with the recording of the first studio CD entitled „MMIV“: Melodic Metal. While recording the second CD „Zero Hour“ the need for an additional guitar grew severe. Stefan joined Desert Sin in 2005 on lead guitars. „Zero Hour“ was approved by critics and fans as well. 
Exclusively for the “Keep it True X” festival in 2008 Desert Sin produced the Promotion CD “All in One”. The band finally has finished recording their first studio full-lenght album entitled "The Edge Of Horizon", which is released via Pure Steel Records in the March 6th of 2009.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Desert+Sin">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
