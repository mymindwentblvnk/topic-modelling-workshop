Crimson Reign is the premiere hardcore metal band in the Kansas City area. Their unique blend of driving rhythm guitar, hard hitting bass and accenting lead guitar lends itself to an unbelievable backdrop of percussive power. The sheer musical muscle and occasional breakneck speed of their sound is enough to turn heads at any venue, but add the performance and lead vocal insanity and they make a face melting, full throttle exhibition. Crimson Reign was co-founded in 2007 by Rhythm Guitarist Shane “Axewielder” Bergstrom, and Drummer Christopher “Nigish” Wesley. When their previous band 4th Reich disbanded, they rose from the ashes with an idea to form a new band that demonstrates the hardcore driving metal sound that they had in them. They brought together a lineup up phenomenal talented musicians that have the same drive and love for that “in your face” metal. They are, Stevie Ray on Lead/Rhythm Guitar and Vocalist Dustin “Wh0reable” Reese. The band is most influenced by the groups Slayer, DevilDriver and Lamb of God. Together they achieve that incomparable sound that is Crimson Reign. Crimson Reign has recently been dominating the Kansas City metal scene with a number of performances at renowned local venues such as The Uptown Theatre, The Riot Room, The Beaumont Club, And Harrah's Voo-Doo Lounge. Some of their accomplishments include: Winner of Metal Wars 2nd Stage Showdown – May 2009, Opener for Metal Wars 2 Main Stage – May 2009, and Opener for nationally renowned group Vadimvon at The Riot Room – August 2009. Crimson Reign is notorious for their volatile, extreme rage performances, and unpredictable live sets. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Crimson+Reign">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
