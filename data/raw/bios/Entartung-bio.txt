Entartung stands for relentless, uncompromising music void of any notion of commercialism, celebrating the true Luciferian spirit. 

All music and lyrics are created by Lykormas and Vulfolaic. It is unclear who does what in the band or whether other (session) musicians are involved. All the lyrics of Entartung are in German.

They recorded their debut album "Krypteia" in 2011. It was released by the German underground label W.T.C. Productions in May 2012. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Entartung">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
