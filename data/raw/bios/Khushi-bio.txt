Khushi (of half Indian and English descent) released a few early tracks back in 2013 and 2014, and was covered by the likes of FADER, Interview Magazine, and Paste. Until now, he has largely been quiet as a solo artist while mastering his craft behind the scenes. 

2019 found Khushi locked and loaded with his debut album produced and performed by himself. He released a number of singles that year, building towards the album release at the start of 2020. The LP was mixed by James Blake, who Khushi supported on tour in the U.S. Khushi also lent his production prowess to various tracks on Blake's most recent album Assume Form. 

Sonically in the lineage of U.K. alternative and electronic giants Radiohead and Massive Attack, Khushiâ€™s music is brimming with distinct, intimate moments that at any given time can build into gorgeous walls of cinematic sound. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Khushi">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
