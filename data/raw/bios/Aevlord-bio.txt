A symphonic black metal band from France. The band was originally formed as a one-man (solo) project in December 2003. The first demo (which is actually a full-length as it is available as an original CD) was recorded in 2004. The demo is entitled "Welcome to My Kingdom" and most work on this album was done by founding member AevLord alone. After that, several other members joined and a complete band was formed. Some time later (in 2007) a new album called "History of a New Mankind" was released. The band is still active and new material has to be released.

The music is highly keyboard-driven (especially on the first album), which gives it a lot of atmosphere and many symphonic elements. Church organs play an essential role on most of the tracks. They also use several types of vocals (typical black metal screams, clean male vocals & female vocals). All this makes their music quite experimental, so they are often labelled as an "experimental symphonic black metal" band." A promo as well as a couple of other songs can be downloaded from AevLord's official website.
