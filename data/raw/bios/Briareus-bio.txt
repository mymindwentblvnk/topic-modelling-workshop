Clay Clorello and Raven Bishop formed the pop/alternative band "Briareus."
They found each other exclusively through Kompoz records.
Raven was writing songs since 14 and started recording in early 2007 releasing a Jamendo album.
The songs reflect pop/alternative, techno and some jazz and blues and even though the songs never waver from the vocal techno dubs completely.

She released Egyptian Fire in 2008. Clay Clorello and Bjorn Pherson helped with arrangement. Amongst 45 musicians they were chosen for the album.

A collection of various songs by Briareus and Raven Bishop are avaliable through other searches.
