OCTANIC are a six piece band hailing from Adelaide, Australia. They seamlessly fuse together elements of hard rock, melodic death and modern metal, laced with classical undertones. This gives their sound the aggressiveness, punch and intensity of metal and the melodic and epic soundscapes of a movie score allowing the listener a complete aural experience.

Octanic most definitely have that particular melodic Scandinavian sound and have been compared to Children of Bodom, In Flames, Soilwork and Dark Tranquility. With a captivating stage presence that delivers a truly energetic and charismatic live performance that has seen them headline and co-ordinate major quality events around Australia.

The bands self-titled second release is an addictive blend of majestic keyboards, bone-crunching rhythms and soaring lead solos, coupled with passionate vocals and compelling lyrics. The album also features live strings and the talented Adelaide University Choral Society.
