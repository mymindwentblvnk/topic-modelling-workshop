Hailing from Colorado, NEXHYMN is a female-fronted death metal band born from the ashes of Throcult in 2010.  The name itself is derived from a combination of the Latin word Nex (defined as death, violent nature, and slaughter) and the word Hymn (a simple song of praise). 

Self-released by the band on March 27, debut EP Black Horizon is merciless, fierce, and reminiscent of the best elements of old and new death metal, taking the listener on a journey of ruthless brutality. 

Recorded at Fire storm studios and mixed and mastered at Flatline Audio, Black Horizon is delivered with unique brutal female death metal vocals, punishing guitar riffs and technical drumming. This implacable recording stops at nothing in its relentless pursuit of pure rapaciousness. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nexhymn">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
