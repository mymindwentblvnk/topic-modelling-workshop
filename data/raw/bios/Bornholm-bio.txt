Bornholm plays pummelling melodic black metal, which utilizes all the hallmarks of the style and also adds some unique touches to the genre. In 2001 the first demo was released called 'Awakening Of the Ancient Ones' and an exciting journey has begun through the dark aeons. The first full-length album called '...On The Way Of The Hunting Moon' came out in 2005 by the French Melancholia Records, which made their name known all over Europe. They opened for Arcturus, Mayhem, Enslaved, Green Carnation, etc. in Hungary and played at the biggest festivals of the country. Their video for the song Acheron was made in 2004 and it is one of the most unique videos in that genre. The second full-lenght was released in 2009 with the title 'March For Glory and Revenge' by the legendary VIC Records from the Netherlands. An atmospheric and beautiful video was made for the song 'Dreams Of Ages' from the album in 2010. Their track 'Where The Light Was Born' was released at MTV RockBand Network. The 3rd full-length album called'Inexorable Defiance' which has been released in 25th of January 2013 by Noiseart Records. The line-up has seen many changes, but as of now, it seems stable.
