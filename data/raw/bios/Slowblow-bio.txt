Slowblow is an Icelandic musical duo consisting of Orri Jónsson and Dagur Kári Pétursson. Their music is an aesthetic of home-made, lo-fi analog tinkerings, which often slips into both electronic and folksy terrain. They started recording in 1994 and have several albums to their credit. They created the soundtrack for the successful independent Icelandic movie Nói Albínói, which Dagur directed, and have worked with other Icelandic artists such as múm's Kristín Anna Valtysdóttir. They have released albums under the Reykjavík based record labels Smekkleysa, Kitchen Motors, and Mobile / Plug. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Slowblow">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
