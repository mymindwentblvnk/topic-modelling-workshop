Instanzia is a power/progressive metal band from Quebec, Canada that traces its roots back in 2004 when Alexis Woodbury founded a project named Kurse with French singer Julien Bazile (Synthesia). A few songs were recorded but nothing really concrete came out of it. 

Alexis kept writing songs throughout 2005 and recorded a demo in the summer of 2005 along with keyboardist Mathieu Fiset but it wasn't released due to lack of vocalist. Drummer Francis Ducharme joined the project in late 2005 and a new attempt at recording the demo was made but once again ended up without vocals. The three guys retried in 2007 but same thing happened again! In the beginning of 2008 Alexis decided he would become Instanzia's singer even though he had never been a singer before, it was the only solution! Guitarist Benoit Messier and bassist Pat Du Tremble joined the band, an album project was launched and the recordings started in August of 2008. Keyboardist Mathieu Fiset worked on keyboards arrangements although he was no longer going to be a full time member of the band. Most of 2009 was spent reworking the album, re-recording a lot of stuff. Pat was replaced by Francis Gagn√© in the summer of 2009.

"Ghosts", the first album of the band, was released in November 2010, thanks to Metalodic Records.
