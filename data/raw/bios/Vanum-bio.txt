VANUM is a new band formed by two of America’s most respected underground black metal musicians, namely K. Morgan of ASH BORER and M. Rekevics of FELL VOICES/VORDE/VILKACIS. Throughout the years, with their own respective bands (namely Ash Borer and Fell Voices), the two like-minded musicians have had a comradeship with each other by sharing split releases and touring together. With VANUM, this marks the first time both musicians have actually collaborated musically together. With the goal of creating a certain expression of dark atmospheric music with each album, the debut VANUM album treads the ground for those familiar with Morgan and Rekevics’ respective repertoires; that of creating some of the most stirring and mesmerizing black metal coming out today.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vanum">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
