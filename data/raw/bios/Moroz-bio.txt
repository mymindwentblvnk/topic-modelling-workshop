Moroz may refer to one of two bands:

1) A Croatian Black Metal/Folk band that self-released one single demo, "Pod Zastavom Svaroga", in 2002.

2) A Lebanese/Russian/French Suicidal Depressive Black Metal band that has not (as far as it is known) yet released any physical records, although digital copies of their 2007 demo "Thoth Hermes Mercury Odin" and their 2010 demo "We Should Have Been Dead, Instead We Were Stupid" have been circulating on FilesTube. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Moroz">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
