A classical Demo of the band ZURT from Santutxu (Basque Country) in the early 90's, not to be confused with another group of the same name closer to Heavy-Metal style and because of this century XXI.Gracias to Gotzon "The king of the demos "I pass this gem, which I had a bit of info and good group ..... It is a short interview in the fanzine TUBE 41 March 1993 and Roberto Moso tells his impressions on poko group and make them a little questioning. I agree with Robert that the lyrics are very Borroka and maketera era but the music and melodies are out of the norm, a classic Rock'n'Roll sound very, very melodic without land position in punk, metal, etc.. If that is the voice of Andoni, vocalist of the famous band DELIRIUM TREMENS and can not deny, but who does not like that so peculiar timbre.
