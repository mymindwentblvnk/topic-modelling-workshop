CAPA is a Chillout project by Norwegian composer Vidar Nord, a producer with an extensive background in songwriting for artists and music production for advertising, television and film.
This project is particularly based upon voice manipulation, it’s about finding unique phrases or sounds when the calculated is being twisted and bent to the uncalculated. Changing conventional ideas around form and structure into a synthetic soundscape.
The album “Capa II” was signed to Lemongrassmusic in summer 2013 and is Capa’s first release on the label, now followed by the album “Epiphany” in 2015.
