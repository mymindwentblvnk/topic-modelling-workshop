Black Bridge is a band based in Rochester, NY who combine elements of powerviolence, grindcore and noisecore into their sound.  They released a demo tape in 2008 on Delinquent Records, a split tape with Hooker Spit Windex in 2010 on Delinquent Records and a split tape with Gorgonized Dorks in 2010 on Feel Good Grind.  The band maintains an air of mystery as they have little online presence and a good deal of anonymity in the current grind scene.   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Black+Bridge">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
