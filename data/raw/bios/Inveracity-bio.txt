Inveracity are a Greek technical brutal death metal band that formed in 1998. Their brand of technical/brutal death metal is similar to Suffocation, Dying Fetus, Beheaded and to a slightly lesser extent Deeds of Flesh.

Since forming they have released two demos, a split with Incision and two full lengths, Circle of Perversion in 2003 and Extermination of Millions in 2007. After the release of Extermination of Millions, the band joined the army for one year in Greece. The law since then has been changed to all those turning 18 years of age must enlist, as opposed to the former law of mandatory joining before turning 28.

Current line up:
George - Vocals (2004-present)
Antonis  - Guitars (1998-present)
George Skullkos- Bass (2010-present)
Vagelis Voyiantzis - Drums (1998-present) <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Inveracity">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
