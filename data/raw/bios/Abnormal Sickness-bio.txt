Abnormal Sickness was created in March 2006 in Katowice (Poland). It was formed by members of other bands like "Ancora", "Vanity Fair", "Your TumouR", "Vegetarian Corpse", "Affective Disorder" or "Wsteczne Muchomory". The band is noncommercial, therefore, it is not well known. In spite of this, their first songs: "Evil and Darkness" (Zło i Mrok) and "Abandoned Grave"(Opuszczony Grób) gained them their first and loyal fans. Their first mini-album named "Burovietz Capta Est"  (published: 22.04.2006) did not show what kind of music they really want to play. They are still developing and trying new tones.

The members are:
SODOMICAL KK (harsh rhythmes)
NAPALM KUXLU (bloody guitar)
INFERNAL PUDEL (beer roar)

According to their official website, all of them were born before Czarnobyl tragedy. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Abnormal+Sickness">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
