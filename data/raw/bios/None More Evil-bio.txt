NONE MORE EVIL was born in the dank, drab, suffocating corner of a suburban nightmare in 2001 and died on the road to hell in 2008.
From Long Island, New York-- where the morbid past-time of wife swapping was perfected into an artform--
NONE MORE EVIL vent all the rage, confusion and disillusionment of a scorned lover and shattered heart through their heavy, beautiful, melodic, and brutal music.
NONE MORE EVIL craft their songs of loss, anger, non-conformity, and dissension with heavy beats, crushing guitar riffs and powerful vocals, adding the occasional sensitivity and the darkest of humor...
you just might die laughing as you slit your wrists.
oh, and... mullets, anyone?

in their lifetime NONE MORE EVIL toured with-
ALICE IN CHAINS, POWERMAN 5000, BUCKCHERRY, RA, DAYS OF THE NEW, WICKED WISDOM, BLACK STONE CHERRY, BRAND NEW SIN, DEATH ANGEL, BILE, THE GENITORTURERS, OVERKILL, BIOHAZARD, DOPE, MUSHROOMHEAD, BREAKING BENJAMIN, GUNS N' ROSES, RATT, HELL WITHIN, FULL BLOWN CHAOS, NOTHINGFACE.

NONE MORE EVIL was the black sheep of their local music scene; outcasts, derelicts, an unwanted bastard child. Whether it be from their incendiary and destructive live show or their 'no BS" approach to business, they had been banned or blacklisted from most of the clubs in their area.
If you had ever felt unwanted, unloved, unappreciated, like an outsider who didn't belong, then you loved NONE MORE EVIL.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/None+More+Evil">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
