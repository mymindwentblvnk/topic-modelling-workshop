FUSEBOXX is a 4-piece Pinoy (Filipino) Progressive band formed in 2001. They are known in the Philippines for their musical precision and technical proficiency. This, especially so for their ability to meld and incorporate Filipino sentimentality with the different musical elements from a vast array of genres they incorporate to their music (rock, fusion, pop, classical, new age, metal, alternative, etc.) in order to create cohesive and thematic materials-indeed, arranging their music into movements that convey a compelling musical message.

Considered as one of the strongest local live progressive metal acts of the country, FUSEBOXX's gigs impress because of their complex arrangements, musical dexterity and performance of their music, as each member puts passion into the music.

With all these qualities, FUSEBOXX shows what Filipino musicians are made of and proves that quality progressive music is indeed spread through all the corners of the world.
