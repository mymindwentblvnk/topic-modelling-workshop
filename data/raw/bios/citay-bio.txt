Citay is an American psychedelic pop-rock band formed in 2004 in San Francisco. The band began as a project from ex-Piano Magic man Ezra Feinberg and Tim Green from Drag Cityâ€™s The Fucking Champs.

The band's self-titled debut was released in 2006. It mixed one early-'70s idea (grand, Zep-style English epics) with another (L.A. folk-rock). 

At first Citay was a studio project between Ezra and Tim, with some help from others. Now there is a live band including members of Tussle, Crime In Choir, The Dry Spells, By Land And Sea, 3 Leafs, Galactic Bunz, Horn of Dagoth and Sweet Potatoes. Citay has toured and/or shared bills with Vetiver, Six Organs Of Admittance, Howlin' Rain, The Fucking Champs, Danava, Earthless, Black Fiction, Daevid Allen (from The Soft Machine and GONG), Papercuts, and many others... 

The second Citay record, Little Kingdom, was released in the autumn of 2007. 

Dream Get Together was released in 2010.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Citay">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
