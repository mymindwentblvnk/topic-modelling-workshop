Lost Resolve is Post-Black Metal from Canada

Lost Resolve is the product of sounds that occur in my mind. It is based in black metal but I am not concerned with labeling  it, or trying to think of where it fits. It is metal that is not based so much on riffs but on driving overtone melodies that occur within a heavy and aggressive wave of sound. I felt the songs were different than Ov Hollowness so wanted to release them separately
