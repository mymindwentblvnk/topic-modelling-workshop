Cuban born, American assembled, and European adopted, singer/songwriter Liset Alea is at home anywhere. She has lived in Cuba, Costa Rica, Miami, New York, Amsterdam, London, and Paris. She writes songs and shreds on the guitar, this makes her happy. She sings in English, Spanish, and French, blending Pop with Folk, adding a dash of Cuban soul and imagination to taste. If she’s feeling a bit manic, she’ll rap. She was an original member of Etro Anime, and now has an electronic side adventure called “Honeythieves”. Liset’s unforgettable voice can be heard on the T.V series 6 Feet Under and Las Vegas as well as on many other compilations. She’s worked as a songwriter for Chrysallis and EMI and has written platinum selling songs for other artists in Europe from Belgium to Czech Republic. She has performed her material at venues such as The Jazz Café (London), L’Olympia (Paris), Flex (Vienna), Magazzini Generale (Milano), The Mercury Lounge (New York). This beautiful, young globetrotter has many stories to tell.
