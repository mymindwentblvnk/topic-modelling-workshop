2) We're thrilled to announce the re-birth of Childhood's End. Gregory John has re-joined the band as our signature guitarist, joining Gregory, Eric Garboushian and Steve Schad in the line-up is Tim Robinson on guitars and vocals and Jimmy Simpson Puma on bass and vocals. With the addition of Tim as a second guitarist Gregory has more leeway to stretch out his immeasurable skills as lead guitarist.
We've been hard at work since the end of last summer rehearsing new material and refining our stage production. We'll be updating our website and myspace page more often, so stay tuned for more info. We'll be working out our production in several club shows over the coming months before returning to larger stages by summertime. Childhood's End has officially come back to life, come share the magic of Pink Floyd at a venue near you soon. To paraphrase a good friend of ours, we'll be tickled pink to see you at a show in the future.
