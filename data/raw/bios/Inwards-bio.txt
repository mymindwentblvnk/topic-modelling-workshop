Inwards is the alias of electronic DJ and producer Kristian Shelley who is based in Worcestershire, United Kingdom. He is known for his introspective, and psychedelic modular synth led experimentations. Electronic textures and rhythms blend with manipulated recordings of real instruments, voices and field recordings to fashion transportive snapshots of an inner sound-world.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Inwards">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
