Formed in Mondeville, Lower Normandy, France, The Eye is a side-project of Vindsval, a member of Blut aus Nord. Much like the early Blut aus Nord albums, Vindsval recorded everything on his own, and the style of music is quite similar to that of the first two BaN albums and of his other side-projects including Vlad and Children of MÃ¤ani.

The Eye was active from 1996 to 1997, during which period he released a demo record Normanniska and a full-length album Supremacy. The project was reformed in 2014 with a new member, the drummer Tor-Helge Skei known for his work in Manes and Manii. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Eye">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
