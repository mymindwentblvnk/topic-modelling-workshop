A black metal project from Helsinki, Finland started by "Nepthunous" aka Henri Sorvali in 1997 who had recruited "Athonian" (his cousin Ville Sorvali) and Kharadrai (Sami Heikura) to play drums and bass, himself handling the guitar and keyboards. Vocal duties were shared. They soon recorded Thornfrost's debut (and only) demo "Upon The Faustian Throne" and released through the Sorvali cousins' UG label Meat Hook Productions.

After the release of the demo, the project went onto a lenghty break due to the other commitments of the members. They added a second guitarist aXul to the line-up and started rehearsing again, switching the style to more avantgardish form. However, no recordings were made and the project eventually died away. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Thornfrost">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
