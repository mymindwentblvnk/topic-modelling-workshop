There are multiple known artists by the name; "Merit"

1. Syracuse, NY 2002 - Present

Merit has been making music for five years. An uncompromised sound, combining indie, modern, and pop rock. Village Voice compares it to Concrete Blonde, if Concrete Blonde had grown up listening to the Yeah, yeah, yeahs. It's a brave amalgamation that has captured the ears and hearts of scene kids and hard rockers alike. Just check the numbers.

In 2004, Merit released their debut album, "When We Fight." The band sold two thousand copies independently. Songs off that record and their recently released Double EP have earned radio play from New York City to Los Angeles. Their hit single, "Man on a String," broke the top ten on Syracuse's KROCK.

The band's touring record? As far north as Canada. As far South as the Carolinas. Merit is a staple at NYC's Knitting Factory, and have opened for a long list of national headliners. Their hard work and unique sound has landed them in front of a wide range of audiences... shredding on the Gritty in Pink Stage at the Van's Warped Tour in 2006. Opening for Liz Phair in front of thousands.

Merit is just what the name suggests. Honest. Sincere. Worthy of a listen. So listen, and come to understand what so many others already do. When this band hits the stage, the game changes. This is different. This is Merit.
