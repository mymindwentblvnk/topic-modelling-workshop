Berlin-based Sprung Aus Den Wolken were part of the "Geniale Dilletanten"-movement in the early 80's along with Einst√ºrzende Neubauten and M.D.K. They made a couple of records on their own Faux Pas and Les Disques Du Soleil Et De L'Acier. Their song "Pas Attendre" was used on Wim Wenders' "Wings of Desire" movie and became some kind of underground hit. Founder Kiddy Citny is also a painter. His paintings on the Berlin Wall have been exhibited through the world and are now in private collections in the USA, France, and Japan. [Bruits Blancs booklet]
