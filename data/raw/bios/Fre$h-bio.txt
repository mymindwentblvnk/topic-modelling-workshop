Through my logical way of thinking as well as witty metaphors, and story telling ability, I am able to keep the listener entertained as well as educated. My First mixtape ... entitled "Dare To Be Different" was selected as the number 1 highest ranked mixtape on the large industry mixtape distributor DatPiff...
