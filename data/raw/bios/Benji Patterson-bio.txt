Benji Patterson is a young upcoming American rapper, singer, poet and songwriter.  His latest release ‘The Love E.P.’ is an insight to the journey he’s currently on. 

Some of the songs on Benji's latest  EP date back two or three years to a time when he was going through a difficult period in his life adjusting to becoming a young adult, moving away from home to start college and having to plan for his future.  

Benji comments “I was insecure and did not believe in myself, because for a long time I’d been surrounded by insecure people who did not lift me up but only brought me down”  The EP focuses on what a lot of kids his age experience.

Having a dream but not knowing where to start. For Benji it was seeing other friends or kids his age living their dreams while he knew he wanted to pursue music but he was in school full-time and no one knew it was his passion. In order to believe in himself he had to reprogram his mind and clear out all the negative thoughts he had about himself. He made the hard decision to distance himself from the friend group that surrounded him throughout high school and some of his college days.  

Benji took a year off social media to re-define himself in his own eyes and under his own terms, “During that year off social media I learned to love myself” he states “Love to me is something that is boundless and exceeds human understanding”.  The Love E.P. is a blend of stories, emotions and conversations from 2016 to the present day.

Through his phenomenal talent and hard work, Benji is certainly one-to-watch in the months ahead.
