Disease Illusion is an Italian Melodic Death Metal band, formed in 2008 by Dario (guitar), Federico (guitar), Fabio (vocals), Alex (drums) and Michele (bass guitar).

Their music is mainly inspired by the legendary Gothenburg sound of bands like Dark Tranquillity, In Flames and At The Gates, but other influences come from every sub-metal genre: the final result is a mix of modern guitar's riffs, groovy and technical drums, catchy and emotional melodies, dark atmospheres, fast rythms and infernal growls and screams, perfect for fans of Amon Amarth, Insomnium, Darkest Hour, Heaven Shall Burn!
Their lyrics treat introspective themes, related to emotions and to the different facets of human soul. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Disease+Illusion">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
