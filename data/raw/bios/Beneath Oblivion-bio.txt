"Beneath doom, beneath depression, beneath despair, beneath horror. There is an emotion emanating from this music that has no word in the English language. To have felt it live was transfiguring. I walked in to listen, and left without need of ears. Something moves in these sounds which is ancient and pristine. It is as blunt as primordial trauma, but slices clean as a surgical knife."

- Ginnie Moon/LUNAR HYPNOSIS
