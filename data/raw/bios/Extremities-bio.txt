There is more than one artist with this name:

1) Extremities is a progressive/groove metal band from Eindhoven, the Netherlands and was founded in 2015.

Their music can best be described as a tasteful mix between Textures, Gojira and Monuments. The songs are dynamic, combining heavy riffing with smooth ambient guitar melodies, and alternating between catchy clean hooks, often fast paced harsh vocals and even tonal screaming. 

Extremities tears stages apart with their energetic live performance and leave the audiences amazed and hungry for more.

2) Extremities (not to be confused with "The Extremities") are a Washington, DC-area noise duo consisting of Pat Gillis (TL0741, Northern Machine) and Scott Feeney (Scrap Heap, Aerosolized Mucus). They performed their first show at a festival in February 2009, having never before played together. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Extremities">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
