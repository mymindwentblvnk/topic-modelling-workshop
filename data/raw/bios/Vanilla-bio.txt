2-Continued) Definitely influenced by the then innovative american scene, VANILLA stood out with an emotional yet tortured hardcore style; very energetic and personal.

After a few changes in the line-up , the band finds its definitive team in 1999 with former members Yves and Yann Maisonneuve (who were also part of IVICH) , Jean LeBrun(former bass player from 1992 to 1996 , now guitar player since 1999) and Alain Vidal (bass player since 1996) . Yves and Alain were also part of the short-lived band EL VIDAL SONIDO. 2001 is the year of their 3rd album release on Paris-based label SALVATION. This new turn in VANILLA's career marks important changes on a musical level but also on the songwriting field : the members' various influences bring a fresh inspiration yet staying faithful to their hardcore origins (the DISCHORD/Washington DC scene remains an unanimous source of inspiration within the band).

6) Girlband from Indonesia. Member : Ega, Anna, Mutia, ilo, Caca and Carla. Their first single is "Beri Aku Waktu". Vanilla is under Harpa Records and Red Icon Management.
