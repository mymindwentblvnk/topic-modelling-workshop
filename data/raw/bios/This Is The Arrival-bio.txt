“Feeling, melancholic, loving live and euphoric.” 

This is The Arrival are four friends, everyone by the age of 20, that have known each other since their childhood and recently have established their name on Munich’s Indielist of bands.  Mario Clement (vocals, guitar),  Timo Kuroschinski (guitar, vocals), Piet Gerhardinger (drums) and Martin Brugger (bass, vocals) write guitar pop songs, sounding like souly Killers or pretty humorous Bloc Party. Catchy like neon lights and danceable like a Justice remix of “Nightfever”, rocking every dance floor you put your shiny shoes on.
