Dom McAllister is a poised young Pop/R&B singer from London - assured, talented and yet curiously humble - with a naturally soulful voice that has stunned audiences on his UK and European tours, supporting Izzy Bizu and Rationale.

Having found early fans in BBC 1Xtra’s Jamz Supernova, Line of Best Fit and CLASH Magazine, Dom saw his independently released debut efforts climb high on the Spotify UK and US Viral 50 charts, as well as having been featured on prolific playlists such as Chilled Pop Hits and R&B UK.

On course to release his debut EP in 2019, which will see Dom addressing personal subject matters such as past relationships and sexuality, and following a sold out headline show at London’s Waiting Room, Dom will drop his new single "Incense" on 5th July. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dom+McAllister">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
