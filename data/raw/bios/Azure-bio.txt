Sweden's extreme metal band Azure was formed in 1995 by guitarist/vocalist Robban Kanto. In the beginning the music was heavily influenced by the melodic black/death metal scene but later went on to a more technical approach when Mattias Holmgren (Embracing, Tired Tree, ex. Naglfar) and Peter Uv√©n (Embracing, April Divine etc) replaced the old rythm section. The lyrics theme takes place in a fantasy world created by Robban called Hevalia, but in different time periods. The latest album "King Of Stars - Bearer Of Dark" is though a continuation of where the Moonlight Legend  album ended.

Discography:
King of Stars - Bearer of Dark  - CD (2005 Pulverised/Deathgasm)
