It was during the summer of 2005 that the band got together, being initially formed by Daniel Moreira and Paulo Afonso on guitars, Francisco Dantas (ex-KAMIKAZES) on drums and Filipe Marinho on bass guitar, in Ponte de Lima, Portugal. 

Based on the personal background of each one, which included styles like death, thrash, black, gothic, heavy, industrial, rock, progressive, etc, soon after some ideas started to appear and some songs were written. It was then that Hugo Marinho joined the band as singer, being replaced by Pedro Dantas (ex-KAMIKAZES) in the beginning on 2006. 

It was with this line-up that the band has become more solid than ever and the first ideas started to be recorded, writing new songs and re-arranging some already written. The band then went live, and after some concerts in the north of the country, they have decided to start the recording of a first album. Produced and recorded by guitarist Daniel Moreira and the rest of the band in their home studio and with the help of Vanessa Fernandes (vocals) and Luis Gomes (artwork), the record “Inside Four Walls” became therefore a reality, being available in early 2007.
