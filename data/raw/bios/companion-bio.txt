5) A progressive rock band from United States, with strong connections to Leviathan (another US progressive rock group). Their only record was Reap the Lost Dreamers (1974).

7) A solo male artist based out of Nashville and signed to Pelican House records.  Poised between simplicity and poeticism, Companion affectionately illustrates what the heart wants to say when it can’t find the words. His songs have a way of reminding us it’s the little things that mean everything. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Companion">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
