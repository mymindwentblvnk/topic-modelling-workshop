About the name of the band, vocalist SABBAOTH says:

“The right is GOATPENIS (talking about the spelling, 'Goatpenis' or 'Goat Penis'). It is a name 'own', created as a name of 'fantasy'. Why is this name to express something rude, boring, grotesque, harmful, aggressive, dirty, offensive and manly. It generates much comment among those who have problems with sexual identity and find the name 'funny' or 'meaningless', attitudes typical of adolescents who believe that the male sexual organ is 'funny', as well as in the form of biology class to have this matter in school. If we check each name of all the bands, many are 'funny' and even ridiculous. I see the band as a whole and not just the name, is like reading the title of a book and give it to read only the title because I do not like.

Many people ask me why 'PENIS OF GOAT'? The answer is so simple...

This name, GOATPENIS, was created, ROUGHLY, in 1988. Since there, until now, many things have changed and will change. Decided to leave the name in respect of which we know and are friends since that time. There are several bands who leave the name not to lose touch with those who follow them for years and years. Perhaps the identity of a band does not have much affinity with the "name" of the band -- but according to the weather. The letters, sound and attitude are more significant than just the name of the band.”
