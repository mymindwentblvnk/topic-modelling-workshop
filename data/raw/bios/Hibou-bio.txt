Hibou is the name of more than one artist:
1) Seattle artist Peter Michel
2) darkcore


1) Peter Michel is a 23 year old Seattleite who creates music under the alias Hibou. Michel toured North America and Europe as the drummer of Captured Tracks’ band Craft Spells. After a year of non-stop touring, the high school student felt his life with the band had ran its course, and that it was time to begin creating his own music. In January 2013 he released a few songs, and soon after received press recognition and positive feedback. Songs “Glow” and “Hollow” have already been featured on international websites and radio shows such as Fat Cat Records, NME, Sonic Playground, Dots and Dashes, and The Line Best of Fit. With a live act in the works, Michel is excited to start touring with Hibou.
