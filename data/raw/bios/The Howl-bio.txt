There are three bands called The Howl. 

1) One was a post punk/goth rock/new wave band in the 1980s who released an LP titled "A Handshake and a Kiss" in 1987 on Dresser Records, which was a private pressing that is now out of print.

2) Another band called The Howl started in March 2003 Barakaldo (Bilbao) with Eneko Baranhano on drums, Imanol Lopez on guitar, and Jorge Rodriguez on bass.  In July 2003, Miriam Barriuso became the current singer of the band.

After a summer intensive, the band decided to play their first show as The Howl facing the public at the Bilborock Club playing together with two bands. The wishes and results were so successful that they went on their way just till November 2003 when The Howl contacted Iosu Murillo (current guitarrist of the band, from Eibar).

A bit later The Howl took part in The European and North American Festival "Emergenza" where the band received first place in the Euskadi finals & third place in the national final in Madrid. Miriam Barriuso was the Best Singer prize of Bilbao in this competition.

With several past and future shows inside/outside Basque Country, The Howl is recording at this moment what will be their new self-produced CD and they already have a Demo recorded and released during autumn-winter in 2004 called "The Howl 2.0." The Howl are in the last stages of recording their next album.
