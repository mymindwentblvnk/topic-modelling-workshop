Felix Jaehn (born in Hamburg, Germany on 28 August 1994) is a German music producer and DJ specialising in deep house. He took violin lessons at age of 5 and began his DJ career at 16. Jaehn lived in London for a year, where he attended a music school at the age of 17.

Returning to Hamburg, he came to prominence in 2015 through his remix of Jamaican artist OMI's song "Cheerleader". The single was an international hit for him topping the charts in Germany, Austria, Belgium (Flanders and Wallonia), Canada, Denmark, France, Ireland, the Netherlands, Slovakia, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom and the United States.

In April 2015, he released a remix of Rufus and Chaka Khan classic "Ain't Nobody" retitled "Ain't Nobody (Loves Me Better)" featuring the vocals of Jasmine Thompson (based on an earlier charting version of the song by Thompson). The remix was an international pan-European hit topping the German Singles Chart. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Felix+Jaehn">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
