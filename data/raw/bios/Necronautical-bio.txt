Necronautical were formed in 2010, as a collaboration between Russell Dobson, James Goodwin and Matthew McGing. 

The trio set about creating the soundtrack to icy cold oceanic sagas through the medium of grim nautical black metal.

Their debut E.P. "Slaying the Leviathan", was released on March 21, 2011, and is a mission statement of the band's intent to sail the seas, seeking out evils old and new, to cast their carcasses into the briny depths. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Necronautical">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
