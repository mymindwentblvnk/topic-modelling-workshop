Future Prophecies aka Richard Animashaun Thomas & Tony Anthun is a drum'n'bass duo from Oslo, Norway. After more than twenty releases on vinyl, and equal amounts of compilations contributions on labels such as Certificate 18, Renegade Hardware, Breakbeat Kaos, Moving Shadow and Teebee's Subtitles, they have finally decided it's time for a full length album!

Guest vocalists on the album are world music artist Mari Boine, and the track "Black Dragon" features a sample of the Norwegian jazz legend Karin Krog. The core of the CD was released last autumn as a three part 12" on Subtitles. But the album also contains the massive success track Dreadlock (Breakbeat Kaos), which recently was nominated for 'tune of the year' on the worlds busiest d'n'b site Drum&Bass Arena, pluss two new tracks, due for release on 12" on Under Constrution. Tunes from this album has been hammered on dub-plate by Djâ€™s as DJ Fresh, Andy C, Adam F, Teebee, Pendulum, Bryan Gee. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Future+Prophecies">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
