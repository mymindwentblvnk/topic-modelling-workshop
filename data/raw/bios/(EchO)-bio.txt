(EchO) is a psychedelic doom metal band from Brescia, Italy. The band was formed in the first days of October 2008 from an idea of Antonio and Simone M. At first the name was Echoes of Perdition, but then it has changed to (EchO). The first lineup of the band was composed by Antonio (Vocals), Simone M. (Keyboards), Mao (Guitars) and Paolo (Drums). In 2008 two new members joined the band: Simone S. as second guitarist, and Nicholas as bass player. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/(Echo)">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
