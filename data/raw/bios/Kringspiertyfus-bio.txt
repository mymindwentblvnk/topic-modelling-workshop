Kringspiertyfus is a grindcore / death metal band from the Northwest of Holland. They describe themselves 'anti-everything'. Armed with shotguns, the deepest grunts in Europe and offensive lyrics, they have quickly made a name for themselves in the little country also called the 'Lowlands'. Their first record 25" Kitchen Knife sold remarkably well in neighbouring country Germany, that they decided to record a second album. This new record "Just Murdered" is rumoured to be released somewhere in 2007...
