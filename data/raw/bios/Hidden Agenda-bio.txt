Though brothers Mark and Jason Goodings didn't begin releasing records until the mid-'90s, they had been working together as a production/mixing team from the beginning of the decade.
 
With Mark's studio wizardry and Jason on the decks, the pair ranged all over the British north country from their base in Newcastle.
 
The duo began recording jazz-inflected drum'n'bass, and after meeting up with Fabio, Hidden Agenda debuted for Goldie's Metalheadz label in 1995 with "Is It Love."
 
Three additional Metalheadz singles followed during 1995-96 (including a spot on the high-profile compilation Platinum Breakz), as well as a release for Fabio's Creative Source Records. Their debut full-length Whatever Happened To... was issued in late 2000.

Tragically, Mark Gooding died in November 2016. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hidden+Agenda">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
