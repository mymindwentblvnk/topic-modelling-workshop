Sweet Thing is a 5 piece Toronto band that plays an upbeat, infectious brand of indie rock, charged with dueling guitars, foot stomping grooves, soulful harmony singing and a healthy dose of hand claps. This is music for the easily bored and the young at heart. The kids have got moxie! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sweet+Thing">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
