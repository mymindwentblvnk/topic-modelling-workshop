Nobody Likes Onions, commonly referred to as "NLO" is an internet podcast talkshow out of Los Angeles, California.  It is always politically incorrect but funny all the same.  The hosts address humorous events in their lives and they also satirize current events, pop culture, other podcasts and even the show's fans. NLO's tagline is "It's like taking a cold shower in sarcasm." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nobody+Likes+Onions">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
