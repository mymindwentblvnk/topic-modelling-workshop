Immorgon was born in 2012 by Charlie Trinkhorn and Anna Vidal. It took a couple of years to adjust the lineup. It is not until mid 2014, when the band publishes its Demo "The Everchosen" that everything settles and the band starts to work on its first album "And Thus We Raid". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Immorgon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
