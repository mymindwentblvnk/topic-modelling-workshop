Buke and Gase (formerly Buke and Gass) are an American experimental/indie rock duo from Brooklyn, New York. The group consists of Arone "Buke" Dyer (lead vocals/buke/foot percussion) and Aron "Gase" Sanchez (gase/backing vocals/bass drum). The name comes from the custom instruments played by Dyer and Sanchez - a six-string baritone ukulele and a guitar/bass hybrid, respectively. The two started playing together in late 2007 following the demise of their previous band Hominid. They recorded their first EP "+/-" in 2008. They were signed to Brassland Records after Aaron and Bryce Dessner of The National saw them playing a basement venue. In 2009, they were featured on the NPR science program Radiolab and shortly thereafter, recorded their debut album "Riposte," for which they toured extensively throughout the U.S. and Europe. In 2012, they released their second EP, "Function Falls." Their second full length, "General Dome," was released in January 2013. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Buke+and+Gase">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
