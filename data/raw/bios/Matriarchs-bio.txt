Matriarchs is a metallic hardcore band formed in Los Angeles CA in 2012. 

Inspired by his affinity for Beat Down and 90s New York metallic hardcore. Ben Levi (Cutthroat) had played with drummer Alfred Santa Cruz, Bassist Miguel Vasquez and Guitarist Marty Cole(Hoods/Arcline) in several other projects through out the last decade so they were no strangers to getting creative together. After playing their first show to a packed house the boys never looked back . An Ambitious release produced by Nick Jett of Terror, and Mastered by Matt Hyde, (lionheart, hatebreed, deftones) Scandalous Jointz fuses together the visual aesthetic and presentation of more thought provoking heavy acts with the sonic ferocity and energy of hardcore. In 2018 Matriarchs parted ways with vocalist Richard Barthel. After teaming up with Jeremy Valentyne and Brandon Wolfe to produce their new release, adding veteran Carlos Pagan to the line up on guitar, David Rubenhold on bass, and meeting new Vocalist K Enagonio during the Pandemic, the band found the new fire it needed. In K the band finds its truest voice. Over the quarantine they wrote their 2nd full length Year of The Rat. 2022 Saw the band touring the United States and Europe as well as adding 2nd guitarist Joe Kenney (See Through You/First Blood) and self releasing an EP "The Shape Of Cunts To Come" adding Melodic and Industrial Elements to their music. The Band is set to take their proper place on the throne of modern metalcore. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Matriarchs">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
