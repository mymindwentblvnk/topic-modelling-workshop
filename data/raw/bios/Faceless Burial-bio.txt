Hailing from Melbourne, Australia, Faceless Burial are a power trio of unimaginable death metal might. Theirs is an unremittingly dark and dexterous sound which draws in a variety of death metal traditions: the gooey grind of early â€™90s Finland, the spiraling surge of classic Tampa, the bazooka-blown fury of old Brazil, the atonal angularity ushered in by Immolation, and the cacophonous caverns traveled by Incantation. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Faceless+Burial">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
