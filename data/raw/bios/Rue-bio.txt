There are Three bands named Rue:

1. A slowcore project

and

2. Since clawing their way out of the sludge of Akron at the onset of 2003, Northeast Ohio's Rue have been bringing a rock demolition to the masses. Relentlessly loud and hard hitting, Rue have hammered the East Coast and Midwest touring with Weedeater, Bongzilla and Rwake, and appearing with Keelhaul, Goatwhore, Eyehategod, Mushroomhead, Yob, 16, Alabama Thunderpussy, Meatjack, High on Fire, Unsane, and numerous others. Rue teamed with independent stalwart Shifty Records to release their self-titled debut CD in late 2003, and participated in a split CD with Aldebaran in 2004. With much new material ready, Rue has been recording and plan to release another full length disc in 2006. With influences ranging from Iron Monkey, Buzzoven, and Celtic Frost, to the Melvins, Acid Bath, and Black Flag, Rue like to lay it down thick and with precision. They plan to defile the road with relentless touring in 2006, so keep an eye out for Rue to blow the windows out of your local bar, tavern, or concert club. You'll hear them coming. 

3. Rue are Cormac MacDiarmada (fiddle), Brian Flanagan (five-string banjo), and Radie Peat (concertina and harmonium). It's just been the three of us since Brian Eno & Urban Cookie Collective stopped showing up for practice.

Rue play traditional songs and tunes from both sides of the Atlantic with an emphasis on the dronier, murderier side of life. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rue">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
