Formed in LA in 2002, The Blood Arm quickly grew into one of the most exciting and dynamic fixtures on the LA music scene and in May 2004, they were nominated for Best New Artist at the LA Weekly Music Awards. 

The band self-released an extremely limited edition collection of songs in their native L.A under the title of Bomb Romantics in mid 2004. A rough and ready lo-fi compilation of their work to date, the record caused enough of a stir to bag them a UK record deal and a string of live dates including support slots with the likes of Franz Ferdinand, the Strokes and Maximo Park. 

The past nine months have seen the band holed up in their east L.A. bunker writing their incendiary debut album, "Lie Lover Lie", a startlingly original and exciting record that features the Bomb Romantics era track Do I Have Your Attention alongside some new wide screen classics such as Going To Arizona and Dolores Delivers a Glorious Death. 

The Blood Arm are: Nathanial Fregoso (vocals), Zebastian Carlisle (guitar), Zachary Amos (drums) & Dyan Valdes (keyboards).
