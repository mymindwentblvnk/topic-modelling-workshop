4) (The) Bedlam: Hungarian progressive-techno-thrash metal band. They are famous mostly of their legendary demos from 1989-90 (General Rejection, Dreamland in Misery). They released one album in 1994, Inside Ash. They changed continuously and did quality music always. They never really got the credit they deserved.
The band returned in 2009 to tour, there were new songs too. Let's hope they will continue!
