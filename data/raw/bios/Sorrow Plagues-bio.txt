Sorrow Plagues is the Brainchild of British musician David Lovejoy who composes, performs and produces the entirety of the music. The project began in late August of 2014 with the release "It Will Never End". He has since gone on to release a further 2 EPs and 2 singles available on Bandcamp, ITunes, Spotify and Amazon. 

Sorrow Plagues combines the raw aggression and production of black metal with the ethereal soundscapes of Shoegaze and post-rock-esque climaxes to deliver a cathartic experience to every listener. Listeners have described a wide spectrum of experiences delivered by the music with some saying "it calms the soul right down" to saying that it's "Strongly recommended if you like depressive atmosphere" <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sorrow+Plagues">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
