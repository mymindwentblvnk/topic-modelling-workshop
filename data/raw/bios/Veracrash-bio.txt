Veracrash are born in the glitter hell of Milan, Italy. Growing up in the Italian undergorund scene they've shared the stage with many bands and toured incessantly around Italy, since 2002. In January 2006 cames out their debut (recorded in 2005). "The Ghost ep" received an endless wave of awesome reviews and feedbacks from all the Italian music press (Rock Sound, Blow Up, Tribe, Rumore and so on...). Their sound is made by different moods, heavy psych rock (aka stoner rock) meets psychedelic metal and alternative rock to create evocative music that reflects the band's stream of consciousness of the moment.

In May 2009 they have released  debut full-lenght album, titled 11:11. 

Veracrash specialize in raw bursts of sound and with melodies that tease with charm, then assault with a deafening onslaught of noise. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Veracrash">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
