Apothis are a U.K. Tech Death project featuring members from a range of bands from the Leicester music scene.  Influenced by bands such as Beneath The Massacre, Diskreet, The Last Felony and The Red Chord, Fans are in for a brutal mix of death while still showing technical flare and skill.  Songwriting: No. Being Technical: Yes. In a world where drop tuning and large amounts of strings seem to be the way forward, Apothis proves you can be just as heavy by taking it back to basics.
