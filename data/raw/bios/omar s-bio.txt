Omar-S is the latest man of mystery from Detroit. His records are low key minimal dirty house music, usually issued only on white label with handwritten info. His love for the music is quite evident from the deep emotional tracks he writes. His music is indebted to tracky Chicago house, dirty Detroit house, and of course Detroit techno. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Omar+S">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
