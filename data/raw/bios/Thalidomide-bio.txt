Thalidomide formed in late 1993 as a power-pop trio consisting of boys in their teens. Since the very beginning they tried to tie together all the influences from bands they've listened to, let's name few, Black Flag, Dead Kennedys, SS Decontrol, D.O.A., Minor Threat, The Freeze & Minuteman. During the years, as the line-up changed the style they played varied a little (to be specific became more and more influenced by US 80ties hardcore) but the pivotal point always stayed the same, the raw and angry but melodic hardcore punk with politically aware lyrics thatâ€™s what Thalidomide has always been. 

Today in 2011, Thalidomide have on their account impressive number of shows all over the Czech Republic, one European tour with UK band The Tone (members of Thatcher on Acid and Schwartzeneggar) and handful of shows in neighbouring countries such as Austria and Slovakia. During all these years Thalidomide have been lucky to have a chance to share stage with bands such as Dead Kennedys (USA), Conflict (UK), Wlochaty (PL), La Fraction (FRA), Rentokill (A), Astpai (A), Article Nine (SWE), The Guttersnipes (UK), Age of Chaos (UK), Sektacore (MEX), Lecsa Punk (HU) and countless others.

The Thalidomide discography counts few demo tapes, various compilation contributions, and a full-length self-titled CD released in 2005. New full-length LP record, which is again self-titled, came out in october 2010 on colored vinyl with a digital download. Both albums are available for streaming and download at http://thalidomide.bandcamp.com
