A band started in 2007 by Joey Powell. The mostly do Lincon Park, Mushroom Head or Godsmack. The Drowning In Darkness's First album was Wanna Die, followed by Deadly Gun I and II and Mind Fuck. A simple 6th Grade band broke up in 2008. The students demanded for more cd's so Joey took things into his own hands. Having many voices and Talents with music, he redid the songs using computers and performed keyboard,bass,guitar, singer etc. The band members are no longer together. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Drowning+In+Darkness">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
