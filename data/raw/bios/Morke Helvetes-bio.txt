Morke Helvetes was originally started in August of 2000.Originated by Suspira and Skein Funeral,the band was originally a 2 sided effort.Suspira wrote all keyboards as well as some guitars and additional vocals.A few months later,Osiris was brought into the band to add additional vocals to new and existing songs.This concept did not last too long,as contact with Skein was temporarily lost and remains currently at a hiatus,more or less.It is unknown whether Osiris will continue to pursue working with Morke Helvetes,but that too is quite possible.

After such events,Morke Helvetes became more of a solo effort of Suspira,currently taking on all songwriting and lyrical efforts.

However,recently a drummer has also been aquired.New songs are in the process of being written. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Morke+Helvetes">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
