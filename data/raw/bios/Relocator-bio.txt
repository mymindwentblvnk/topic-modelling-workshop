Relocator‘s 2010 debut turned quite a few heads as it featured none other than former Dream Theater keyboardist Derek Sherinian as a special guest. But the album had more to offer than just star power: Helped by Dutch drummer Frank Tinge and Polish electric Violinist Bartek Strycharski, project founders Stefan Artwin (guitar) and Michael Schetter (born Pruchnicki, bass) delivered a varied, dense mix of progressive metal and modern fusion. The album was praised by critics all over the world and nominated for “best debut album” at the Progawards 2010. The live unit retains the core band featured on the CD, with newcomer Sergej Schamber (Ocean Spout) taking the place of Derek Sherinian. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Relocator">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
