Meant as an outlet for songs written by Mission of Burma bass player Clint Conley, post-punk band Consonant formed in 2001 with supporting bandmates Chris Brokaw (formerly of Come and Codeine) on guitar, Matt Kadane (ex-Silkworm and Bedhead) on drums, and Winston Braman (from Fuzzy and The Count-Me-Outs) on bass.  Conley switched to guitar in the Boston-area super-group.  Their self-titled debut was released in spring of 2002 and a sophomore record titled Love and Affliction was released in 2003. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Consonant">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
