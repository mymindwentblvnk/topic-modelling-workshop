DEFORMATORY is a technical death metal band from Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Forming in 2010, DEFORMATORY set out to create a relentlessly extreme and unique sound, fusing together classic influences (Cryptopsy, Morbid Angel, Suffocation, Neuraxis, Nile, etc.) and their love for modern tech death. 

DEFORMATORY independently released their full length debut, In The Wake of Pestilence, in December of 2013. This pummeling 9-track beast has been exceptionally well-received by fans worldwide, and has been cited as being an "outstanding and monstrous debut album. Essential. (Frank Rini - AllAboutTheRock, ex: Internal Bleeding), and "flawless in every way" (TheBloodShed). 

Having shared the stage with bands like Cryptopsy, Napalm Death, Obscura, Beyond Creation, Gorod, Nader Sadek, Archspire and Fuck The Facts, DEFORMATORY are more than comfortable delivering their crushing brand of extreme metal to live, screaming, and sweaty audiences. 

The band is currently recording their second full length album entitled Malediction and is slotted for release in 2015 courtesy of CDN Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Deformatory">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
