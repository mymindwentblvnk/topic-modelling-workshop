River Fury are Dan (guitar/vocals), Pat (guitar/vocals), James (bass) and Stefano (drums). Playing eclectic guitar-based indie pop, they have been described as a mix between The Flaming Lips, Arcade Fire, The Strokes and early Pink Floyd. Raw and exquisitely beautiful harmonies intermingle over driving post-punk pandemonium.
