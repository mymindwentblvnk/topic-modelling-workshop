Pathological Abomination was formed in Late 2011 with the aim of making some quality UK Slamming Brutal Death Metal in the vein of Abominable Putridity, Devourment and Visceral Disgorge. The band was founded by Ollie White (Guitar) and Ben Adams (Bass/Guitar) and Dan joined the band in January 2012. Dan left the band in April 2012 after being a little bitch. After some delays the full length is going to be recorded starting from June 12 2012.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pathological+Abomination">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
