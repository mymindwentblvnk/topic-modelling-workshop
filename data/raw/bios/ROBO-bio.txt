Robo is a multi-talented artist from the United States, who started writing lyrics in sixth grade, and released his first rap mixtape in 2017. To his surprise the mixtape got incredibly positive reception, so he continued releasing mixtapes throughout the following year. 
He even began trying his hand in producing, and tried out producing multiple different genres and realized how much he enjoyed doing those instead of rap. This lead him to start branching out to making many genres, such as melodic rap, indie, metal, alternative rock, trap metal, and more recently what most would consider "hyperpop."
