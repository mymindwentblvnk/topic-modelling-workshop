Finland's Pharaoh Overlord take huge rock songs and turn them into minimal trance-inducing drones. Pharaoh Overlord features members of Circle. Their earlier records are stoner/jam rock, moving on to more experimental/space rock sounds, also incorporating krautrock, on their third full-length. On the instrumental riff-based rock album "#4" metallic tendencies began to show, which were further developed with the band's sixth full-length "Out of Darkness", a straight-up 80s heavy/speed metal record.

There are two "different" incarnations of the band, one written "Pharaoh Overlord" and one "Pharaoh Overlörd", each with different lineups:
