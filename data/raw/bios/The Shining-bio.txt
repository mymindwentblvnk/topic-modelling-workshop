There are multiple artists with this name:

1) The Shining were an English rock band formed in 2002. The band comprised of Duncan Baxter (Vocals), Dan MacBean (Guitar), Mark Heaney (Drums / ex-threshold, ex-the seahorses), Simon Jones (Bass) and Simon Tong (Guitar, Keyboards), the latter two both ex-members of The Verve. The bands originally featured former The Stone Roses-guitarist John Squire, however he chose to leave the group early in the band's lifetime. Lack of interest and motivation on Squire's part were reasons cited to this decision. They released the three singles "Quicksilver", "I Wonder How" and "Young Again" throughout 2002, and then their first album "True Skies", all of which were minor successes. They split in 2003. In 2007 The Verve reunited with Simon Jones, but not with Simon Tong who currently plays in the 2 bands the good, the bad & the queen and transmission.

2) The Shining is a dutch trash metal / punk band formed in 2001 in Amsterdam.

3) The Shining was a goth band from Birmingham, UK, cold, synth-heavy, droning, drowning and quite bleakly glorious all in all. They were active again around 1990 - 1991, and are now generally totally unknown, outside of a few people who were around that scene and associated at that time.
