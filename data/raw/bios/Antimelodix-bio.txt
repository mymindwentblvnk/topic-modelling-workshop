The band Antimelodix was founded in 2006 by members of different punk, hardcore, metal and noise bands. During first 3 years they have been taking part in some local punk gigs in our hometown Petrozavodsk. The band changed its line-up several times during all this time. Their music is strongly influenced by swedish punk and norwegian black-metal along with BLACK SABBATH and MOTÃ–RHEAD. Fast yet hypnotizing karelian crust/d-beat. Active nihilism. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Antimelodix">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
