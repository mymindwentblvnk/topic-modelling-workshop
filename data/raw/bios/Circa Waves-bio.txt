Circa Waves is a 4-piece British  indie rock band formed in Liverpool, UK in 2013. The band consists of Kieran Shudall (vocals, guitar), Sam Rourke (bass), Colin Jones (drums) and Joe Falconer (guitar). The band released a double-A side single late in 2013, featuring "Get Away" and "Good For Me" and an EP launch in mid 2014 (Young Chasers EP) on the Transgressive label.

1st Album - Young Chasers (2015)
The band's debut album,Young Chasers, was released on March 30, 2015 on the Virgin EMI label and was produced by Dan Grech. Harriet Gibsone in the Guardian described the album as having "traces of We Are Scientists, the Kooks, the Libertines and Razorlight". It features the title track from their 2014 Young Chasers EP, as well as the singles "T-Shirt Weather" and "Fossils".

2nd Album - Different Creatures (2017)
The band's second album,Different Creatures, was released on March 10, 2017, on the Virgin EMI label and was produced by Alan Moulder and Kieran Shudall. After releasing three different singles ("Wake Up", "Fire That Burns" and "Stuck"), the band came up with a deeper and more mature composition that keeps the first album's energy adding more meaningful lyrics and unusual instruments like violins and cellos.
