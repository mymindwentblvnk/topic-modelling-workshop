Broken Dream is a husband and wife who love to live, love, and play music together.They have been actively playing in the Oklahoma City area since the beginning of 2006, and been together since December of 2005. (When Steven was forced to retire from his job of ten years due to disability. Steven was born with a genetic condition called Osteogenesis Imperfecta. Roughly translated it means imperfect bone growth. Because of this he has broken over 400 times and had countless surgeries just to be able to function. In 2005 it finally caught up with him and he was no longer able to work. 
Broken Dream is a mixture of Old school Metal and modern hard rock. Very original and meaningful music. They are currently independent and have started their own label called Broken Records in OKC to produce their music. Broken Dream Rocks! Check em out and spread the word!
