Brutally Butchered began in 2006 in the High Desert of the Antelope Valley with only two members with Animal on guitar and vokills and Esteban on human skins. They decided that the A.V needed some death metal to listen and pit to. The band took a break, but now they are back with some brutal shit for fuckers all over the A.V and anybody else out there listening. El Pirujo joined as bass player to join our torture songs and to have fun blazing that ganja. So enjoy our shit and support us and go to our shows. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Brutally+Butchered">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
