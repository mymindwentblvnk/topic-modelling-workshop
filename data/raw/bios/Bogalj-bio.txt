Bogalj is a thrash-influenced black metal band from Podgorica, Montenegro. 
This is mixture of satanic black,death and thrash metal in the minimalistic and ritualistic way.
Insane to the core!
Their "Primitive Sounds" promo 2006/07 was released in limited edition just for trade and not for sale, by Adzove Vrbe Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bogalj">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
