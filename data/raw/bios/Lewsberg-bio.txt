Lewsberg are a Dutch post-punk quartet from Rotterdam, consisting of Arie van Vliet (vocals, guitar), Michiel Klein (guitar), Shalita Dietrich (bass) and Joris Frowein (drums), named after writer and fellow Rotterdammer Robert Loesberg, famous for his controversial novel Enige Defecten published in 1974. The book is the main source of inspiration for the band with its portrayal of the counterculture and big-city cynicism of the 1960s and 1970s. After putting out The Downer (EP/cassette) and 7" single Non-Fiction Writer in 2017, Lewsberg released their self-titled debut Lewsberg full-length in April 2018 featuring nine rudimentary and repetitive rock songs, full of a tough, nonchalant intensity. The group's sound recalls the likes of The Velvet Underground, Galaxie 500 and Television.
