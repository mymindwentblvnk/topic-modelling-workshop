Hot Cross was a post-hardcore band formed in Philadelphia in 2000 on Hope Division/Equal Vision Records. The band comprised members from bands such as Saetia (vocalist Billy Werner and drummer Greg Drudy, who was also a founding member and the original drummer of post-punk group Interpol), Off Minor (bassist/guitarist Matt Smith), You and I (guitarist Casey Boland), Neil Perry, The Now and Joshua Fit For Battle (bassist/guitarist Josh Jakubowsky). Their songs are composed of intricate (and in the beginning of their career, dueling) guitars heavily influenced by Drive Like Jehu.

On July 6th, 2007, the band announced via their MySpace that they are 'indefinitely inactive'. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hot+Cross">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
