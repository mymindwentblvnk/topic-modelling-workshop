Formed in 2001 in Portland, Oregon, Yellow Swans played a constantly evolving mass of psychedelic noise that is both physically arresting and psychically liberating. Their music is powerful rendering of free rock, black electronics, and white light vibrations. Consisting of Pete Swanson (vocals, drum machine, and electronics) and Gabriel Saloman (guitars, feedback, electronics), Yellow Swans created a dense ocean of sound using various analog and digital machines, all locked in a spiraling web of feedback. 

In April 2008, Pete Swanson announced the band's break up. In an email to Pitchfork, Swanson stated "There are no specific reasons why we've come to this point, but both Gabriel [Mindel Saloman] and I have decided that it's in our best interest to move on from the project. Neither of us have any intention to stop playing music anytime soon, but we will not be playing or performing with each other again."
