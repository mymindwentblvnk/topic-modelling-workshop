Ahma is a heavy metal orchestra hatched in 1995. For several not-to-be-spoken reasons they have been maintaining a moderately low profile since. The current incarnation of the band is either its third, fourth, or fifth, depending on who you ask. 

The sound of Ahma is thoroughly enhanced for hearing impaired, and can be best described as LOUD.
