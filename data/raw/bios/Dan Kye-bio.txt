Dan Kye is the electronic music alter ego of the neo-soul artist Jordan Rakei. Jordan Rakei burst onto the scene when he arrived in London on New Years Eve 2014. After a 24 hour flight taking him to the other side of the world, Jordan came straight to the pool hall to bring in the New Year with Rhythm Section. This is where the journey began. 

By 2016, Jordan was able to immerse himself into the London scene, winning plaudits from countless tastemakers and thousands of fans along the way. He sold out a European Tour, shared stages and studios with musical greats and released one of the most acclaimed albums of 2016 - the fact that he did this all by himself (with the help of a few friends) cements the fact that Jordan is a future great in the making. His output is relentless, his imagination; boundless. For a musician so unconstrained by style, one moniker would never suffice. Enter Dan Kye: Jordanâ€™s stripped back electronic alias. 

In 2016, Jordan Rakei released his first Dan Kye project: Joy, Ease, Lightness, a 4 track EP aimed squarely at the dancefloor, but with a meditative awareness that reaches far beyond the club. He would then follow this up four years later with his debut full-length album under the name called Small Moments. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dan+Kye">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
