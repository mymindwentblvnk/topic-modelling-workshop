In January 1994 the band recorded it's first demo: 'Epitaphs For A Shallow Grave' which was reviewed in Terrorizer magazine and scored 3.5 out of 5. Impaler left in August 1995 to pursue different interests and the band was put on hold for 9 months until replacement guitarist Shane Davies was recruited in April 1996. This line up remained the same until until January 1997 when Ollie left. He was replaced in April 1997 by guitarist Karl Chapman.

In November 1997 the band won the Unsigned Battle of The Bands competition at London's Red Eye Venue (which was reviewed in January 1998 edition of Terrorizer magazine). Late in 1997 three new tracks written by the new line up, which had been premiered at the competition, were recorded at Zoo Studios in Hitchin and released as a three track EP. This was released through Copro Records and as such gave the band distribution with all the big record stores in England and some outlets overseas. The band gigged to promote the EP up and down the country supporting acts like Benediction, Hecate Enthroned, Desecration, Gorerotted and Demoniac.

Everyone went their own ways in 1999, but what started out as a few guys making a noise for a laugh ended up as one of the most successful underground metal bands in the area. Chris decided to put the EP (now completely sold out and out of print) up for free download for people to enjoy rather than let the music collect dust.
