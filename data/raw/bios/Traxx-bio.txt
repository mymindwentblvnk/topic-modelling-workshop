There are multiple artists named Traxx

1. Chicago born and bred Melvin Oliphant aka Traxx is known for constructing the "jakbeat" sound -- "a turbo-charged take on old school acid and Chicago house for the '00s put together with the unmistakeable tones of classic analogue gear such as the TR-909, TR-808, and, of course, the TB-303". 

Traxx has released music on numerous underground labels in the US and Europe including Gigolo, Relief, Muzique, M/O/S, and Cr√®me. His music was released under various aliases including Dirty Criminals, XX Art, Mysterio, ViLLan X, Saturn V(with Tadd Mullinix), X2, and more.

Gillen, Matt Nee(Kompute), Josh Werner, Stephen Hitchell plus early on work from Jamal Moss aka Hieroglyphic Being.

In addition to a number of 12"s Dirty Criminals released, two albums were very well received in Europe -2004's "Organized Confuzion" and 2006's Collision Between Us And The Damned" which featured a cover of an early unreleased version of "Acid Tracks" by Phuture that was played around Chicago.
