Deprecated is a brutal death metal band from USA.

The members are still together, however, a lot have other projects. Derek filled in on bass for the recording of Decrepit Birth's "And Time Begins" before joining Suffocation as their full time bassist. A.J. became the vocalist for Disgorge (US) and later Defeated Sanity (Germany). Matt was always Decrepit Birth first and foremost. He rehearsed with Deprecated for 2 months in late 1999. He played a show with Deprecated before moving back to Santa Cruz to finish Decrepit Birth's first record. Today, Matt and Terrance Hobbs of Suffocation act as studio guitarists for the new Deprecated recordings. Original Deriding His Creation and touring guitarist Greg Laff went on to become a producer & DJ. All material written by Derek, Torrey and AJ. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Deprecated">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
