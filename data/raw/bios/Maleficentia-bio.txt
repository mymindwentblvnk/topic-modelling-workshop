Maleficentia was a French Melodic Black Metal band born in June 1998 with Aragoth from Mausoleum, whom wished to play keyboards to add a Melodic vibe. He was shortly joined by Molkhor from Garwall on drums, Camazoth on guitars, Nergal on bass and Lolth on keyboards and finally, Balrog from Genital Grinder, the vocalist.

In October 1999, Maleficentia debuted their first record in the Awake studio. "Born of Steel and Fire", was released in spring of the year 2000 - with the help of Everlasting Association. After some gigs, the band's line-up has changed in October 2000 with Lolth, Camzoth, Nergal and Balrog's leaving. Shortly after these members decided to quit - a new member; Arpad joined as a keyboard player in November 2000. 

In May 2001, Daevhorn from Ave Tenebrae replaces Balrog on vocals and in June, Ashragon and Svarog from Collapsus took respectively guitars and bass guitars.
With this new line-up, Maleficentia released his second album entitled "Under the Banner of Suffering", produced by Melancholia Records in May 2003. After Ashragon and Svarog's quit, Daevhorn decided to take the guitars. The band recruited Ayperos from Spectrums of Oblivion as bass player in February 2005.

Maleficentia composed their third album "Revelation From The Ancestral Whisper" affirming more than ever a return to the sources of brutal music, while keeping the lyricism of the same ideas, to the viewers.

Today, "Revelation From The Ancestral Whisper" is a big success in addition to the awesome productions and the band is looking for a label which will produce and spread their music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Maleficentia">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
