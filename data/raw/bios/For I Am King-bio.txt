For I Am King is a five-piece melodic death metal formation hailing from Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The band consists of Alma Alizadeh (vocals), Wouter Cammelbeeck (guitar), Jurgen (bass), Koen (guitar) and Jaap Relou (drums). They formed in September 2013 and released their debut EP "Revengeance" in July of the following year through VHMetal Records. This quickly established them as a rising star in the European Metal scene and garnered them a contract with German label Redfield Records, through which they would go on to release their debut album "Daemons" in 2016 along with the follow-up "I" in 2018. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/For+I+Am+King">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
