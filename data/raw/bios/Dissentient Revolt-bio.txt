Dissentient Revolt

Formed in 2006 after the break up of Half-life, we went through several members (Drummers being a particular problem for us) before settling on our current line-up. Chico decided to learn the drums (From playing Bass) hence a hiatus for a year while we got our stuff together and Chico learned his skills. Our last bassist Mark left just after recording the debut demo CD 'A thousand honey voices' in 2008 at Chuckalumba studios, Dorset. Now set-up as a three piece, and after playing some debut shows we are ready to storm 2009.

The debut demo CD 'A thousand honey voices' in 2008 was recorded at Chuckalumba Studios in Dorset with John Stephens at the controls (Electric Wizard, Ramesses and Moss amongst others have recorded there from time to time). We are busy writing material for our debut album on a well known English label for 2009.

We wanted to find ourselves, sculpt our sound for no-one except ourselves, we are an eclectic mix of heaviness, fastness and electronic destruction. Collaborations with fire (POY), sheet metal, grinders, drill, water and electronic devices (Burn with me) make sure your mind and sight are indeed in for a treat. We breathe life into our lives by exploring your towns and cities. We have a device.… Boom, boom, boom, we came, we made noise, we destroyed, we went home… you went away pleased!

Dissentient Revolt are:

CHICO MCGILL (A.K.A Rik): DRUMS/BASS Ex Bassist/guitarist for Corporate Grave, Nothings Real, Older than dirt, Half-life and Ficus amongst others. Now drums with a passion, whatever he lacks in technique he makes up for sheer feel and power.

Review from The Organ, August 2008:

DISSENTIENT REVOLT – A Thousand Honey Voices - Intense thrashing brutal mean violent in-your-face muscle-bound hardcore industrial metal from the South of England. All blast beats and thrash riffs and grinders and sparks and people who have more than done their time and learnt their craft. Eight brutally relentless dark violent growling global noise attacks. And all coming in good looking professional artwork and when does a demo become a finished album? The lines are blurred these days. They don't say anywhere that this is out as a finished album, and it isn't packaged as such, I guess they're wanting someone to pick it up and put it out. Well worth investigating – colourful brutal confrontational violent hardcore industrial metal delivered with attitude and impressive style.

We are finite, transient pieces of a self regenerating system. The whole greater than the sum of countless parts.Exploiting mortality. Endless, soulless, faceless, callous. I am a part of that which I abhor. I am a gear of the machine. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dissentient+Revolt">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
