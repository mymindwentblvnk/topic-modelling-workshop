Limbus 4 was created in 1970 when  Limbus 3 added Matthias Kniepper, thus forming, a quartet and went to record the puzzling Mandalas lp, a further step in their cosmic ethnic improvisations, this time making use of a more varied instrumental palette and taking advantage of the possibilities of the recording studio. A unique album that ranks amongst the most adventurous ever released by Ohr and which, to make things even better, spots another of those cool Reinhard Hippen covers designs made of doll parts (which graced the covers of the first five of the the label's albums.. this being actually the second ever Ohr release). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Limbus+4">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
