   The band was formed in Ume√•, Sweden  in the late 90`s, and was consisted of:
   Andreas Stoltz - vocals and guitars
   Marcus Bigren - guitars
   Tomas Nilsson - bass
   Urban Vikstrom - drums
   The band released a self-titled mini-cd in 1997, and two albums (both released through Nuclear Blast ), Modern Cathedral  (1997) and Architect of the Mind (1999).
  In the fall of '99 Hollow went on a small tour in Norway, along with Norwegian Progressive Metal band Divided Multitude. Playing on Oslo's rock bar Mars, the sound on stage was fatefully loud, and Andreas damaged his ears to the point that rehearsing was no longer possible. Hollow chose to split up, since finding a new singer was never in question, because Andreas was the main sonwriter and leader of the band.
Hollow is now a solo project with all material written and performed by Andreas Stoltz, who has limited his activities only to studio work.
