Old school death metal from costa rica, the project was created by Eduardo Marenco who was the guitar player for Mantra. The drums, bass, vocals and other elements have been assigned to some guest musicians. Right now, the project is being recorded in Planeta C studios in San Jos√©, Costa Rica.
All the songs have already been tracked and are getting ready to be mixed and mastered, what people hear in their Ep is just a sample of how the recording process is developed.
