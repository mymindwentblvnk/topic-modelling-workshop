Sydney producer Donatachi seems to be shaping the genreless musical utopia we're barrelling towards, boasting a veritable who's who of future pop voices in their collaborators and a reverence towards the early millennium top 40 stars as well as modern club boundary pushers in their production. Across their originals and remixes, the independent artist creates plush soundscapes that are full to bursting with hyper colour sound design and forward thinking club beats, all with an optimistic, flair and unironic love of the genre. With releases on Sidechains and Good Enuff, collaborations with Oh Boy, Mallrat and Boy Sim under their belt and over 1 Million streams on Spotify, their unique ear for glossy pop voices and underground hyper-pop has made them one to watch. Through their 2Pop mix tape series they consistently proves they've got their finger on the pulse of the glistening underground, broadcasting slick club sounds and international pop weirdos with every instalment. Their debut EP is set to feature even more hot collaborations, as they hone their sonic aesthetic and sees how far they can push their bubble-gum bops. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Donatachi">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
