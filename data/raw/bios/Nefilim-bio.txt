Nefilim is a Carl McCoy project formed after the disbanding of Fields of the Nephilim. It featured McCoy on vocals, Paul Miles on guitar, Simon Rippin on drums and Cian Houchin of Saints of Eden on bass. Rippin and Miles would later go on to form Sensorium. Nefilim released one album, Zoon, which was more industrial/metal in nature than McCoy's previous releases with the Fields of the Nephilim, though similar themes of mysticism and occultism are prevalent, visible in titles of songs like Pazuzu (Black Rain). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Nefilim">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
