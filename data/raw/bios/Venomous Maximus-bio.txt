Venomous Maximus is a Dark Heavy Metal band from Houston, TX. The sound combines intense, unabashed metal riffing that locks into heavy rock grooves featuring interjected dual leads and surprisingly darkened atmospheres. Add to it the distinctive voice of towering front man Gregg Higgins and his unorthodox, unsettling tone, and unholy sinister laugh

I think this band will make some big waves. There's something ominous, and intimidating about their overall vibe...it's some type of attitude that encapsulates every riff, and movement in the music...it gives them that creepout factor of really good doom, but then they do straightforward metallic stuff spot-on as well
