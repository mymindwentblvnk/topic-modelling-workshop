Bands
1) - Philistine is an industrial death/doom metal band in some ways similar to Toadliquor, Bunkur, Moss, and Halo. Other musical inspirations include Khanate, Godflesh, Neurosis, Crowbar, Isis, and Cult of Luna. The band formed in the fall of 2003 with the intent to generate a primitive but mind crippling wall of sound, coupled with intelligence and introspection. Philistine's first release "Consume and Devour" is a mammoth, low-end fueled, aural assault. All fans of "slow and low" should check this out. This full length album is available for free in its entirety.

2)  - The “Philistines” are Deangersmith and Marq Vas. Hailing from South Africa, having been part of the Metal scene since the mid/late 80’s, Dean having served time in a number of pioneering Metal acts back in the day, including, Ragnärok, Odyssey ZA, 2 Dogs Funking and Brothering, Marq fronting the controversial MetalMorphosis, they often played the same stages…Dean and Marq initially first jammed together in the early 80’s, becoming close friends threating to one day deliver a full-on collaboration. A full collab was in the works in the early 2000’s, with both now living in the UK, however Marq relocated back to South Africa. They again churned out a slab of demos whilst both living in Canada, to keep fueling the beast in the mid 2000’s. Finally, the two have joined forces, now back in the U.K, to unleash their arsenal of Metal messaging upon the unsuspecting public! Their cocktail of sermons, a lethal mix of one simple ingredient, “Heavy Metal”, served straight up, no frills, no fark around, no pretense and no bolliet – old school!
