The Go-Betweens were one of the most internationally influential indie rock bands from Australia, formed by guitarists Robert Forster (b. 1957) and Grant McLennan (1958-2006) in Brisbane in 1977. After disbanding in 1989, Forster and McLennan reformed the band in 2000 with a new line-up, however, they disbanded for good after McLennan died on May 6, 2006.

The Go-Betweens were a critically-acclaimed cult act famously summarised by Village Voice critic Robert Christgau thus: “Robert Forster and Grant McLennan are the greatest songwriting partnership working today.” 

Early drummers Lissa Ross and Tim Mustapha were followed by Lindy Morrison, who was a constant member through the six albums the band recorded in their first and most prolific era.  Robert Vickers made the band a four piece when he joined on bass for the third album - "Spring Hill Fair". He left following the fifth album, to be replaced by long-time Brisbane muso John Wilsteed. Amanda Brown (violin, oboe and vocals) was the other key member, heavily influencing the Go-Betweens sound on the final two albums in this period.

The Go-Betweens toured overseas numerous times and produced such indie hits as "Cattle and Cane" (1983) and "Streets of Your Town" (1988). After recording six acclaimed albums, Forster and McLennan disbanded The Go-Betweens in December 1989.

Forster and McLennan pursued solo careers throughout the '90s but were inspired to work together after they were invited by fans at French music magazine Les Inrockuptibles to perform at the magazine's 10th anniversary.

In 2000, Forster and McLennan reformed The Go-Betweens, assisted by all three members of Sleater-Kinney, and recorded the album The Friends of Rachel Worth. 

The most recent line-up (2005) included Forster, McLennan, Adele Pickvance (bass) and Glenn Thompson (drums).

In October 2005 The Go-Betweens finally achieved mainstream recognition, with the album Oceans Apart (produced by Mark Wallis and Dave Ruffy) winning an ARIA award for Best Adult Contemporary Album.

Grant McLennan died in his sleep at his home in Highgate Hill, Brisbane on May 6, 2006. He was preparing for a party at his home when he mentioned he was feeling ill, and went to lie down. He was found later that night, and is believed to have suffered a heart attack. With McLennan's death, Robert Forster announced that the Go-Betweens are no more.

"The Go-Betweens have made their final album. They have played their final show. We let it rest at that, being very proud of what we have done." - Robert Forster (May 7th 2006).  In June 2007, a tribute album, Write Your Adventures Down, was released in Australia.
