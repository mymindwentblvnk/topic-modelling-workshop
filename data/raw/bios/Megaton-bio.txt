Megaton is the name of several bands:

1) Megaton is a Mexican heavy metal group from Torreon, formed in 1988, releasing only one selftitled album before splitting up.

2) Megaton was a NWOBHM band from London, UK formed in 1980 released in 1981 single 'Aluminium Lady / Die Hard'. Now split-up.

3) Brazilian thrash metal band.

4) Argentinian heavy metal band.

5) Swedish band releasing one album, ...Superior, on Megarock in 1995.

6) Megaton is the creative inspiration of vocal harmony leader Les Humphries (as in The Les Humphries Singers, big hit makers in early 70'sGermany) and his writing partner/right hand LHS man, Jimmy Bilsbury.

7) A Norwegian rock band with members from Seigmen and noplacetohide.

Perhaps having the likes of future Uriah Heep vocalist John Lawton in the midst of the LHS was an inspiration, but whatever, Humphries nose for a commercial opportunity sniffed out the Free, Led Zep hard rock/ blues rock market and he duly delivered. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Megaton">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
