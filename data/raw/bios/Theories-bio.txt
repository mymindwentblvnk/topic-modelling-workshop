About
"A death metal/grindcore band from Seattle, Washington. Although they only been around since 2011, they have made their presence known in the already grind-heavy Seattle scene. In the fall of 2013, Theories embarked on a west coast tour, playing with dozens of local and national acts, in preparation for entering the studio to record a new album. The bands has shared the stage with Goatwhore, Toxic Holocaust, and Black Breath among many others." - Outliers Talent Agency <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Theories">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
