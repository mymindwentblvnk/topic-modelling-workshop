Bad Karma is a hard rock band made up of three musical misfits from Melbourne and one import from WA. With a sound described as a cross between Guns n' Roses and Disturbed with some Pearl Jam thrown in, their music is big, heavy and of course, LOUD, while still being melodic and thought-provoking. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bad+Karma">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
