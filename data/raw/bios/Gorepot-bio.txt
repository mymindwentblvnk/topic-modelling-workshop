Gorepot is a weed-themed brutal death metal band from Taiwan. The band was formed as a one man project by Larry Wang (Corprocephalic, Maggot Colony, Beyond Cure) but later recruited two other members on bass and guitar. The band never employed a drummer so thus all their recordings and live shows are always done with a drum machine.

So far the band has seven full-length albums out; Happy Hour (2009), Extreme Bongest (2011), Fermenting the Chiba Seeds (2012), All You Can Smoke (2014), In Pot We Trust (2015), A Friend with Weed Is a Friend Indeed (2017) and Asian Stoned Effect (2018). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gorepot">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
