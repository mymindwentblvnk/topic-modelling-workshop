There are multiple artists using this name.

1. A Philadelphia soul group. The group's got harmony chops that are plenty strong -- with an ability to hit both a sweet soul sound and a deeper righteous groove that was being used by some of the funkier groups at the time. The Futures made a poor career move when Gamble Records ended up signing with Buddah Records, thus missing a golden opportunity to join Philadelphia International Records. Without the major label support that Philadelphia had to offer bands like the O'Jays, Harold Melvin & the Bluenotes, and the Stylistics, the band failed to reap the benefits of their productions.

2. Self described funk thrash from Japan.

3. A pop-punk band from the UK. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Futures">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
