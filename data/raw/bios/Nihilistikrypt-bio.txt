Recovered, but not yet fully treated from Psykhosis (2011), Nihilistikrypt has recruited its lines with some new psykhopaths and will now reveal a glimpse of the background of Psykhosis by partially uncovering the actual log of the person responsible for all of the mayhem described in the lyrics of that album. It will be cruesome and disturbing, but whether You like it or not, it has happened before, it will happen again, it’s just a matter of time, when. And to whom. Probably You.

NIHILISTIKRYPT was formed in Tallinn, Estonia in 2004.
