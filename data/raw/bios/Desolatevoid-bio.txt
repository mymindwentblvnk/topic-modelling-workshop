Desolate Void was formed in 2003 by Asinine Solution guitarist Pat Sova along with Tim Smith and Andy Howard from Invicticus. A bassist was later added as was Matt McNally as the second guitarist. Changes started happening in 2004 when the bass player went AWOL. After a few months McNally relocated to the Twin Cities to attend school. The 3 core members still wanted to remain a 5 piece, so Nick Carroll, former bassist for Legion of Doom and CAH Records boss, came on board to provide the low end rumble. Around the same time Invicticus bassist, Brent K, was getting the urge to play guitar again. The current line up started rehearsing in the summer of 2005 and geared up for recording and gigging. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Desolatevoid">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
