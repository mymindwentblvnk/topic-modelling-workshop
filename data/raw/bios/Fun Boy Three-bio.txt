After the break-up of the original line-up of The Specials; Terry Hall, Lynval Golding and Neville Staple broke away to form Fun Boy Three.

Their peculiar brand of politically driven retro-pop made an impression on the British pop charts during 1981-1982. Their biggest hit was Our lips are sealed, a retread of Go-go's 1981 song, which was co-written by Terry Hall. Other well-known tracks include The Lunatics (Have Taken Over The Asylum) and T'ain't What You Do (Its The Way That You Do It), recorded with the fledgling all-girl group Bananarama.

Fun Boy Three's music draws on influences such as vintage soul, ska, reggae, muzak and kitsch movie soundtracks.

The band split-up in 1984, and Terry hall went on to perform solo and also form The Colourfield. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fun+Boy+Three">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
