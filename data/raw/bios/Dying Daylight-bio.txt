There’s a time for everything.  Dying Daylight has come to the end of it’s road. Suvi isn’t able to continue  on this road with us and because Dying Daylight has always been the 3 of us there’s no point to go on with this name. 

This is a bitter sweet moment for me and the decision was hard for me to do but as mentioned without Suvi it’s not the same. Dying Daylight has always been very dear to me and will always be.
This is the end of Dying Daylight and beginning of something new. Santtu and I will continue making music under new name.  At this point it seems music will be something similar but it’s quite early to say. I’ll keep you posted.

We want to thank everyone for the support and feedback. 
I want to thanksSuvi and Santtu + rest of the people from our journey. I Can’t even say how grateful I am for being able to work with such pros like you guys 8).

We wish Suvi  <3 all the best.
