Spasticated Razor Masturbator were a Grind band from Leeds. That roughly played from 2003-2005 before members parted ways/moved away.
The group was a 3 piece lineup, with Rich (also of Afternoon Genlteman, Joe Pesci, and about a billion other bands) on drums, Dan (who also went on to play in Joe Pesci) on guitar, and Nina on vocals.

The band released one demo to decent acclaim, although it is well out of print by now unfortunately <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Spasticated+Razor+Masturbator">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
