Among the Mortals is a melodic death metal band from Oulu, Finland. Formed by T. Luosuj√§rvi and V. Hanhisuanto (then V. Junno) in 1997, they released 'A Duet of Tragedy' by the end of that year.

Due to persistent line-up problems and other difficulties, the band was put on indefinite hold in 2002. They re-activated in 2005 as a two-man studio project and eventually released 'oiad' in 2009.
Their debut full-length album Of Ignorance and Dismissal was released on 19th February, 2011.

Their music draws influence from bands like (90's) Death, Carcass and the early Gothenburg (gothenburg) scene, adding progressive and/or symphonic elements to the mix especially in recent material. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Among+the+Mortals">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
