Joanna Gruesome are a five piece band from Cardiff (Wales) and England, UK.

Joanna Gruesome were formed in 2010 in Cardiff at the suggestion of an anger management class. Their debut album, written in occultist Brighton hotel The Hell House and produced by MJ of Hookworms, was released on Slumberland Records (USA) and Fortuna Pop! (UK). A crossover record between c86 indie pop and riot grrrl and hardcore punk, it received praise from Pitchfork, This is fake DIY and Rough Trade. They have played in the UK and Europe with notable artists including Los Campesinos!, King Tuff, Herman Dune and Hookworms, and in the United States for New York's CMJ festival. Joanna Gruesome are known for their energetic live shows and forthright feminist and anti-homophobic views. Despite their name, none of the band members is called Joanna; rather, this is likely to be a play on the artist Joanna Newsom.
