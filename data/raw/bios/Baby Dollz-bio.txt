The Baby Dollz have all the pieces in place to become the next super girl duo. Born in Los Angeles, CA, Ana Lou and Bebe (both 16 years old), met on the basketball court in the seventh grade and there they discovered a shared passion for music. The Baby Dollz are the ultimate girlie girls who love fashion, makeup, shopping and watching movies. They have acted in plays, performed in talent shows, sang in the church choir and dream for success in all their endeavors. Additionally, the girls hope to design their own fashion line and know that they can make their wishes a reality with support from their family and friends. Ana Lou and Bebe's biggest influences are Beyonce and Cassie â€” they admire the empowerment of their music and how it provides a positive message for girls. The Baby Dollz love to perform and share their excitement with their fans and are looking forward to creating music history.
