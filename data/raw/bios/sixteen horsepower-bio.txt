16 Horsepower was an alternative/traditional musical group based in Denver, Colorado. Their music was usually serious in tone with distinct Christian religious lyrics dealing with conflict and redemption. For the bulk of their career, the band consisted of David Eugene Edwards, Jean-Yves Tola, and Pascal Humbert (the latter two formerly of the band Passion Fodder). After releasing four studio albums and touring extensively, the band broke up in 2005, citing "mostly political and spiritual" differences. The members remain active in the groups Woven Hand and Lilium. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Sixteen+Horsepower">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
