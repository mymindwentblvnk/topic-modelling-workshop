Marc Streitenfeld is a German film score composer, known for his collaborations with director Ridley Scott.

Born in Munich, Germany, Streitenfeld relocated to Los Angeles at the age of 19, first working briefly as a musical assistant for composer Hans Zimmer, then independently as a music editor and supervisor on several blockbusters.

At the request of Ridley Scott, Streitenfeld composed for A Good Year (2006), after acting as music supervisor on Scott's 2005 film Kingdom of Heaven (scored by Harry Gregson-Williams). He then went on to score all of Scott's subsequent films to date. He was nominated for a BAFTA award for Scott's American Gangster (2007). Regarding working with Scott, Streitenfeld said "I've done quite a few films with him now and every experience has been really good".

Prior to his work as a composer, Streitenfeld had collaborated with Scott as music editor, music supervisor and technical score advisor on several projects, including Matchstick Men, Black Hawk Down and Gladiator.

Since 2007, Streitenfeld has been in a relationship with French-American actress Julie Delpy. In January 2009, the couple had a son, Leo.

As of 2012, Streitenfeld has provided the score to Joe Carnahan's film The Grey and will be providing the score to Ridley Scott's forthcoming film Prometheus. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Marc+Streitenfeld">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
