1° Post-metal band from Venice, Italy. The first full length "The Herald" is released in January 2016 and is a conscious journey of the mind and soul.

2° From the heartlands of the Australian bush, Wagga Wagga, come the amazing sounds of Seventh, the latest in rap-core metal. Their first single, I'm Gonna Fly, was Unearthed by Triple J in the Riverina area, and since then has received huge airplay on JJJ. This is justified, as the song is a winner. The searing vocals are accompanied by crunching guitars and drums, which all combine to give a fearsome coalescence. 

Every once in a while, although not as often as we like, one band manages to forge through the incoherant screaming of the genre and produce a piece of music which is genuinely beautiful.

'I'm gonna fly' is definately a piece for late night, preferably rocketing down a long deserted highway on your own with fierce melancholy thoughts in your head. The beginning reminded me suspiciously of the 'This is Halloween' theme from 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' and continued in a deliciously Burtonesque theme where darkness and off-kilter emotions can be beautiful. It is heavy, but not too heavy, perfect for people who like to vent their angst while still having an understandable tune to enjoy.

The song 'Lifeless' was used as a soundtrack for the ending theme of an award-winning video game called 'Operation Flashpoint' which was the best Army-Game since then in the year of 2000. The 'Resistance' expansion of Operation Flashpoint Features more songs by Seventh, including Communism, Darken, Decide, Im Gonna Fly and Overdose.
