"Kat & Roman Kostrzewski" is polish thrash/heavy metal band, that was formed in the end of 2004th by Roman Kostrzewski (vocals) and Ireneusz Loth (percussion), after collapse of the former band - "Kat".
The band is known for extensive touring, mostly in Polish clubs, which thay have done since 2004. The concert-oriented approach meets with wide acceptance from Polish fans, since Roman Kostrzewski is one of, if not the, most recognizable metal music symbols in history of Polish metal, mostly due to his lyrical talents and controversy. This results in "Kat & Roman Kostrzewski" being more concert and Poland-focued band (e.g. singing entirely in Polish), while Luczyk's "Kat" has reorientated towards the west, which results in switching to English lyrics and not touring in Poland.
Kat & Roman Kostrzewski have up to date released on live DVD "Życie po Życiu" in Dec 2007. It was pretty well received as the performances were strong, but criticized for low-end production. 
Next output from the band will be their actual first studio album. After a long wait, new album "Biało-Czarna" ("Black and White" - a wordplay on Polish national colours Red and White) is to appear in april 2011 via Mystic Production.  The premiere is followed by preorders, and samples have been  publicized with one track "Milczy Trup" ("The Silent Dead") leaked in its entirety.
