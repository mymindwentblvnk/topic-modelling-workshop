West Indian Girl is a psychedelic rock band from Los Angeles, who released their self-titled debut album in August 2004 on Astralwerks.

The profound power to transcend common themes of fear, hope and love using only phrasing and imagery is a rare gift, second only to one's ability to render out the proper combination of notes and chords with which to propel those words into our hearts. With influences that include British rock and roll and the soul-seeking ethos of 60s psychedelia and modern day jam bands, Robert James and Francis Ten build opulent compositions that revolve around texture, mood and lyrical romanticism-songs that are inspired by ideals and motivated by feeling, much like the two musicians themselves. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/West+Indian+Girl">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
