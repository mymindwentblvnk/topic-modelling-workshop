Black Cobra is a doom metal and sludge band from San Francisco, California. The band was formed in 2001 by Jason Landrian and Rafael Martinez (who was also the former bassist for Acid King).

After logging several years of experience with sludge metal icons Cavity and doom prognosticators Acid King, among other bands, New York-based vocalist and guitarist Jason Landrian and L.A.-based drummer Rafael Martinez began working in 2001 on a new project that would ultimately become known as Black Cobra. An eponymous EP eventually saw the light of day in 2004, followed by the full-length Bestial in 2006 and mini-album Feather and Stone in 2007, by which time the duo had developed into a vicious, super-distorted heavy metal machine reminiscent of Mastodon and High on Fire.
