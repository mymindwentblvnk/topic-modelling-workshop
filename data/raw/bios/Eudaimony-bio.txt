EUDAIMONY was formed in July 2007 by Matthias Jell (vocals/ex-Dark Fortress) and Marcus E. Norman (guitars/Naglfar, Bewitched, Havayoth, Ancient Wisdom).

The idea behind EUDAIMONY was from the beginning on to create music, which reflects the band members’ view on every-day life in this society: sick, disturbing and negative.

Jell came up with the idea after he left his former band and since Norman and he were long time friends, already respecting each other musical wise too, it was clear that Norman would be the first one to ask for the guitarist-position and he agreed.

In September 2007 Jell and Norman met in Umeå, Sweden, composing the first material for EUDAIMONY and during two days they recorded three songs for their actual promo, which are namely “Ways To Indifference”, “Cold” and “A Window In The Attic”.

Short time later Michael Håkansson (ex-Evergrey, Engel, The Project Hate) joined the band on bass and in March 2008 the line-up got completed by Jörg Heemann (Secrets of the Moon) on drums.

With this unity, EUDAIMONY will go on spreading negativity in its purest form. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Eudaimony">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
