The band was founded in 1999. During March 2002, DISPARAGED released their first CD-EP "Deathtrap" which spread its fire around the underground, and within a year, DISPARAGED was well known. The band with Tom (vox/guitar), Ralph (guitar), Adrian (bass/vox) and Heinz (drums) had a bunch of great reviews for their debut CD and live shows. They played with bands such as Cradle of Filth, Immolation, Messiah, Hate Plow, Rage, and during the Metal Dayz with Slayer, Annihilator and Nile, among others.

In August 2003 the four guys decided to record their first long player "Overlust", which would the next logic step after "Deathtrap" and connects directly where their debut ended. The band seems more homogenous, plays tighter and grew as a team. Every song is unique and offers the whole bandwidth of the hardest metal genre… Death à la carte so to speak.

March 2006 saw the release of DISPARAGED's third CD: "Blood Source", a new oeuvre eagerly awaited by both critics and fans. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Disparaged">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
