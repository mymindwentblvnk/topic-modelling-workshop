We are Ardulph Ardebahr Wald, two introverted german musicians and philosophers. The band exists since early 1999 when we´ve met at a mental home. For us our music is a document of our friendship and in the end it describes and preserves the path that we´ve walked together until now. The music intensifies the emotions of a melancholically feeling being - our emotions: ETERNITY , TREMENDOUSNESS , CONFUSION , LONELINESS and after all DEATH! "... a world in which everything seems to be vulnerable and everything shines with moonlike darkbrightness and the beams of melancholy have got faces, the sad faces of horses..." We play and produce our music by and for ourselves, though we invite anybody who feels the same way to join our community... <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ardulph+Ardebahr+Wald">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
