TCTS is Sam O'Neill, a young producer and DJ from Manchester, United Kingdom. With the support of promoter / Dj Seb Wildblood, Sam cut his teeth at London club night Church, playing with heavy-hitters such as Bondax, Disclosure, Boddika, Dark Sky, Damu, Juk Juk, Ifan Dafydd and Jacques Greene to name but a few. His first EP, 'Hands', came courtesy of the Cool Kid Music label which landed in at number three in the Juno bass music charts. In June 'Hands' was named a “bass music secret weapon” by Beatport putting him alongside such luminaries as Machinedrum, Nathan Fake and Gang Colours.

Some words on Hands EP from Juno -

‘Sassier than a slap from a glam queen crunked up on sarsaparilla, "Hands" is both cuttingly sharp and stupendously silky. Futuristic garage with echoes of neo soul and soft whispers of classic Chicago house, each of the three numbers on offer reverberate with grooves strong enough to seep into tomorrow. "Hands" shimmies with spine-tingling R&B chords before dropping into a clanging late night bassline frenzy, "I'm Gonna Lose My Baby" is both tribal and twinkling with its robust 4/4 and laser-loving toplines while "And So We Find Ourselves" could sit happily both on daytime radio and on the deeper floors. A rare breed.’ <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/TCTS">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
