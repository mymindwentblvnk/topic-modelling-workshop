Night Snipers (Russian: Ночные Cнайперы) is a Russian rock band. Found in 1993 as an acoustic duo of Diana Arbenina (Russian: Диана Сергеевна Арбенина) and  Svetlana Surganova (Russian: Светлана Яковлевна Сурганова). The ladies played guitar and violin respectively, sharing the vocals and songwriting duties evenly, eventually adding amplification to the band. Since its inception the band has participated in a variety Russian gigs — from the underground (such as Babye Leto and Moguchaya Kuchka) to the major events (Nashestvie, MAXIDROM, Krylya), as well as touring extensively domestically and abroad.

Night Snipers' best known singles are 31st Spring (31 весна), Frontier (Рубеж), Capital (Столица), Asphalt (Асфальт), and Actress (Актриса). The majority of the songs in band's repertoire is written by Arbenina and Surganova, but some using the poetry of such authors as Joseph Brodsky, Anna Akhmatova, and Federico Garcia Lorca. In 2002 Svetlana Surganova departed the band to start her own project Сурганова И Оркестр, while Diana remained the front-woman of Night Snipers.
