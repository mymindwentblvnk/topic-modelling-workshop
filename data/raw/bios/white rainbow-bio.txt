Almost an institution in Portland, Oregon (where he is currently Music Curator at the Yale Union contemporary-art center), Adam Forkner has been making meditative, ambi-tasting, improvised master jams (punctuated with dance-floor rhythms) since the mid-’90s—in collaboration with others in Yume Bitsu and World, Dark Yoga, Surface of Eceon, and solo as [[[VVRSSNN]]] and White Rainbow.

The music of White Rainbow flows through assorted albums on the Kranky, States Rights Records, Marriage Records and Gnar Tapes labels. He has recently self-released several albums via his bandcamp digital storefront. whiterainbowpizza.bandcamp.com 

Beyond his own musical output, Forkner has worked as both an instrumentalist and producer with a wide array of contemporary musicians including Jackie-O Motherfucker, Atlas Sound, Dirty Projectors, D Yellow Swans, YACHT, Adrian Orange, Little Wings, Devendra Banhart and many others. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/White+Rainbow">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
