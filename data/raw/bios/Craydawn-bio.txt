Craydawn is a Finnish power metal band begun by guitarist Antti Wirman and keyboardist Mikael Blomberg in 1997 under the name 'Wisard'. In 1998, guitarist Pekka Palmu, bassist Janne Katalkin, and vocalist Luis Herrero joined and after trying out a number of drummers the band added drummer Mikko Sepponen to the line up. Later that year a three track demo was recorded, entitled Drowning, this was the group's first recording and Blomberg's last as he left the group after recording and was replaced by Vili Ollila. 1999 saw not only the recording of Wisard's full-length Open Skies but also saw the departure of bassist Janne Katalkin. During the Nummirock Festival in 2001 Markus Lind√©n filled in on bass before Fabio Oksanen was tapped as a permanent replacement for Katalkin. A demo entitled Sheets of Lies was recorded shortly before Jaakko Teittinen took Pekka Palmu's position as guitarist and Wisard was rechristened Craydawn. Craydawn ended the year as a supporting band on tour with Sonata Arctica. Since then the band has been gigging actively in Finland but remain as yet unsigned. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Craydawn">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
