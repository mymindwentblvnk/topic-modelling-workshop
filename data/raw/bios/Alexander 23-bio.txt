Alexander Glantz (aka Alexander 23) got his start as a songwriter and musician who has toured the country playing drums and guitar, as well vocals. Inspired by his father, Alexander quickly developed a love for music, picked up a guitar and never put it down.

Today, his layered sound utilizes all areas of music including up-tempo drums, pop and trap beats, and his effortlessly flowing falsettos. His debut single, “Dirty AF1s,” made an instant splash hitting Spotify’s New Music Friday playlist and garnered early recognition from Apple Music who premiere the track as their “Bop of the Week.” Following the single, Alexander 23 pushed out a steady stream of music including “When I Die,” which led Lyrical Lemonade to recognize his songwriting, narrative, and overall sound, calling it “one of the best songs [they have] heard in recent memory,” and “Mars,” which was added to Spotify’s “Chill Hits” (4.7m followers ) playlist. Additionally, his sound caught the attention of singer-songwriter, Alec Benjamin, who tapped the newcomer for his sold-out North American “Outrunning Karma Tour.” The tour showcased Alexander’s vibrant talents, knack for DIY and shy-yet-curious character. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Alexander+23">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
