BIO
Old school American death metal, grindcore, deathgrind, goregrind. Fueled by Jack Daniels, PBR, and old horror movies.
Identified as old school American death metal/grindcore/deathgrind/goregrind, and fueled by Jack Daniels, PBR, and old horror movies, Grisly Amputation was founded in February 2010 by guitarist Gene Fikhman and drummer Chris Dissell after their band Scorched broke up. Wanting to take their new project in an old school death/grind direction, Gene first brought on board his fellow guitarist from steel city sludge band Vulture, Garrett Twardesky (ex-Shipwreck I Promised), who came up with the name Grisly Amputation. They started writing material, as well as trying out bass players and vocalists — eventually striking gold with Pat Butcher (ex-Lethal Prayer, ex-Omneity), a bassist who had previously worked with Garrett in First Day Dead; as well as newcomer Rob Grisly on vocals.

In the past year, the band has opened for numerous local bands as well as some national touring acts — including Nokturnal Hellstorm, Deceased, and most recently Cannibal Corpse, whose bassist Alex Webster (with whom Butcher had previously taken lessons) personally selected them as local support when his band’s tour hit Pittsburgh.

Grisly Amputation takes its inspiration from all over the spectrum of grind and death metal, although with a particular focus on west-coast and New York styles; their primary influences include such bands as Cannibal Corpse, Suffocation, Disgorge, Autopsy, Last Days of Humanity, Reinfection, Rompeprop, Cock and Ball Torture, Death, and Inhume. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Grisly+Amputation">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
