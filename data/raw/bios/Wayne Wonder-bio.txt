Wayne Wonder (born Von Wayne Charles in Buff Bay, Portland, Jamaica on 26 July 1972) is a Jamaican reggae fusion (specifically reggae / R&B) artist. While his early recordings were dancehall and reggae, he later moved towards hip hop and rap.

He auditioned at Sonic Sounds studio, but while Sly Dunbar was impressed, his touring commitments with Black Uhuru prevented him from signing Wonder. He had more success, however, with King Tubby, who produced his first single, "Long and Lasting Love", in 1985, with two more following.

His new album Foreva boasts collaborations with world renowned dancehall producers Don Corleone and Tony Kelly (Sean Paul, Elephant Man). It includes the singles Again and For My Love. 

Wayne rose to fame in 2003 with the song No Letting Go, which reached number 11 on the Billboard Top 100. 

While other dancehall artists are known for their rapping style, Wayne Wonder's claim to fame is his unparalleled, velvety smooth singing voice. 

Wayne was born in Buff Bay, Portland, Jamaica, and moved all over eastern Kingston including a stint in Rae Town - home of the weekly Reggae/R oldies street dance which inspired him to take a more soulful approach to dancehall.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wayne+Wonder">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
