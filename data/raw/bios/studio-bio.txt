Studio was D. Lissvik & Rasmus Hägg. On January 3 2012, Dan Lissvik announced the end of Studio on his website.

They were based in Göteborg, Sweden. Studio has been described as the missing link between The Cure and Lindstrøm touching on Can, Neu, Happy Mondays and The Smiths in their creation of an afrobeat-dub-disco-indie-pop adventure. Their album "West Coast" on Information was chosen by Rough Trade in London as one of the 10 best albums of 2007 and they have remixed artists such as Kylie Minogue and A Mountain of One. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Studio">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
