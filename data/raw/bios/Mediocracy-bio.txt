Crust/sludge/thrash metal band from Bucharest, Romania.
"Mediocracy is a situation in the society in which mediocre people prevail. The society is subordinated to a quasi-egalitarian ideology in which words and ideas are redefined to be convenient for the average people. Other symptoms include dumbing, jargonism, infantilisation, vacuity, phoney democratisation and authoritarianism." Sounds familiar? We thought so, too... This is what we thought reflected our view of this society and system we live in. We are opposed to fascism, state control, religion, hate, war, authoritarianism and the constant dumbing of people in this society which embraces these things. We consider this band to be a breath of fresh air and also our voice crying out so that it will be heard! We're taking influences from a wide range of crust/hardcore/punk/metal bands and this is what we came up with! This is Mediocracy! See you soon!"
