Hailing from Chicago, The Atlas Moth take their bluesy hometown roots and combine that with New Orleans style sludge & 60s psychedelic. Gritty and raw, yet thought out and insightful. If you grew up living in a swamp wearing a Black Sabbath T-Shirt and ate nothing but fried chicken, this is your band.

"Hails to The Atlas Moth! This is slap your mama up against the wall and eat your biscuits and red-eye gravy swampin' sludge! A band to look out for, and for sure lock up your daughters!" - The Sludge Swamp
