Correctly tagged as Kyle Dixon & Michael Stein, they are members of the American synth band S U R V I V E and composers of the soundtrack to Netflix's hit series "Stranger Things". Just as its story goes deep referencing the classics of VHS era science fiction and horror movies, Dixon and Stein's music is hugely inspired by the likes of John Carpenter and Tangerine Dream, the masters of tension and synth soundscapes. While indebted to the classics, they've still managed to create instantly recognizable classic themes, making the series even more mysterious and memorable. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kyle+Dixon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
