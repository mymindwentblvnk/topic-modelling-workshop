RONIN is the name of multiple musical acts.

1.) Ronin aka Jonathan Axelsson was born in Sweden, and got in touch with music very early in life since both his father and grandfather were musicians. As a young boy he started playing drums, and then continued with piano lessons. In the mid 90's he discovered a new type of music that would change his life forever. The music he heard was called deep house, and struck Jonathan's heart immediately. He now started to produce music in a more serious matter and in 1997 he got in touch with Johan Bacto, which later formed the label PlackTown Sounds. Jonathan was now known as Ronin, and made alot of releases on the PlackTown Sounds imprint. With a lot of great feedback from radio stations, magazines, DJ's and even television, Ronin continued on the path of sensual, moody deep-house. His music was reaching out to the world, and in the year of 2001 he released a mini LP on Chris Grays label, Deep4Life in Chicago. Chris gave Jonathan his second artist name J. Axel, and he was now focusing on vocal deep-house, and he started working with the talanted vocalist Astrid Suryanto. He still produced instrumental deephouse as Ronin, and in 2002 he made a release on The Timewriter and Terry Lee Brown Junior's label Driftwood. In late 2004 Jonathan completed his album, "J. Axel - Deepness Is Served", which was released 31st of July 2006 on the German record label Boh√©me. Later, this album was re-released by Plastic City. Since today, Jonathan has released on various labels, contributed with music to many compilations, as well as DJ'ing in alot of clubs over the years. His releases and DJ-sets have always been critically acclaimed, and its a fact that he will keep on delivering music with presence and luxury, which touches mind, body and soul. Now you can find Ronin's selected works on two releases "PlackTown Sounds Vol.1" (released: december 2008) and "PlackTown Sounds Vol.2" (released: march 2009) on Plastic City.

2.) Ronin (Italy) was Bruno Dorella's project back when he was drummer for Wolfango. Slow, moving songs, soundtracks for imaginary films. In the summer of 1998, in Pesaro, Dorella found the striking inspiration he was looking for: a festival that Wolfango were supposed to play in was cancelled due to bad weather. The only band that was able to play was an acoustic, Slovenian band which drew the audience's attention all the time they played.

The Ronin project had to get going and musicians needed to be found. The hunt was extensive; for a rocker like Bruno, finding harmonica and violin players was not exactly easy, but he eventually met the right people and the first mini-cd was released, Ronin EP on Bar la Muerte in 2002 and the band played gigs in Italy, Slovenia, Croatia and France.
The eponymous debut album was released by Ghost Records in 2004.

The new album "Lemming" is out in January 2007, again on Ghost Recoords.

3.) Ronin (USA) is digital hardcore musician who appears on DHR's compilation "Don't Fuck With Us!" a three-disc collection of underground American digital hardcore music.

4.) Ronin (Singapore) may have risen to become one of Singapore's most popular and successful bands in recent times, but as the members themselves will tell you; "The going has not been easy. It wasn't easy, and we take nothing for granted.."

Back in 2002, these five lads had big dreams and aspirations but were too ignorant and oblivious to the music scene around them to get their act together for the longest time. There were about as into Hip hop, nu-metal, indie rock and pop rock as Jim Morrison was close to being sober; a non-existent relationship. Levan Wee, the uniquely blonde and fair-skinned albino vocalist, was into Les Miserables and U2 while Bang was preoccupied with spreading the gospel of Black Sabbath. You get the picture. But all five Ronins (Levan Wee, 23, vocals. Derryn Wong, 23, bass. Sean Cheng, 22, Lead Guitars. Bang, 23, Drums. Simon Lee, 23, rhythm guitars) were determined to bring back the glory days of old school rock n' roll to the masses by their own means and visions.

So these five lads spent the better part of the first year playing obscure and strange far-out gigs in places like Katong Sh*t-Knows-Where, Hougang Mall-In-The-Middle-of-Nowhere, and even had the cops raid on them (by complaints from neighbours) when they were jamming 'inconsiderately' on the roof tops of their own jamming studio. A future career in music was nowhere in sight but these five individuals stuck together through all the tough times to emerge a stronger and more focused band after overcoming each and every obstacle. They had a dream to live, and nothing was going to stop their dedication. RONIN continued writing songs, jamming, arguing and playing gigs for the next year and eventually gained a growing reputation as one of the most exciting live acts in town.

Their big break came in 2003 when they decided to record their first EP with legendary producer Leonard "The Hand" Soosay, who crafted the music they had written into what it sounds like today. Fast, fever-pitched rock n' roll anthems to blast through your speakers at blistering volumes. The EP allowed the band to get higher profiled shows which led to them playing to bigger audiences.

RONIN continued honing their craft, and eventually gained the interest of the mass media. Their live shows became steadily more escentric and many hailed the band as the scene's up and comers. RONIN, however, remained oblivious to modern trends and the 'in's of the music industry and continued doing their own thing and crafting their own visions. Their army of fans began growing by the hundreds as the power of the word of mouth took its course. RONIN was the band to watch out for.

The EP was a hit with the fans and the media alike, which instigated the band to follow it up with their first full length album.

By this time, RONIN and UNIVERSAL MUSIC had established relationships with each other. The band recorded "DO OR DIE" at Snakeweed Studios with Leonard "The Hand" Soosay once again, and finally signed a deal with UNIVERSAL MUSIC at the start of 2005 for the distribution of the album.

"DO OR DIE" was released on the 22nd August, 2005, and has since risen to become one of the best selling albums in the country, with RONIN becoming one of the most high profiled bands in Singapore, performing to huge crowds of thousands. Their first hit singles "Black Maria" & "You Got Mojo" have received heavy rotation on Power98 and 98.7FM and have recently entered the national singles charts. The band is currently filming their first MTV and have plans to go regional in the coming months.

The album is a testiment to all the turbulent times that the band had to go through to get to where they are right now, and is a message to all their fans; Never give up on your dreams till you live them. It's DO OR DIE baby, and don't you ever forget it.
