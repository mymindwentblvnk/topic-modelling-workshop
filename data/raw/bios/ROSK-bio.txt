(1)  ROSK is a Polish band playing ritual metal music. It was formed in the April 2014 after Amenra and Cult of Luna played their concerts in Warsaw. The gigs were an impulse, an inspiration to start creating music that would be honest, full of atmosphere and sadness.
They spent their first year on talking about their inspirations and dreams, and finally started rehearsing in 2015. In the spring of 2016 they released their first demo, recorded entirely using home recording methods. However, in November 2016 they already entered studio and in January 2017 they released their first LP entitled MIASMA.

Hypnotizing, burning explosion of futuristic synth pop sounds flowing from an alternative rock volcano!

Listening to the Art Collective album is like pursuing an exhibit curated by an actual art collective. The songs are vibrantly varied but share a creative kinship. Sensual vocals, fizzyelectro-pop hooks, rugged beats, and glitchy electro passages. The album will be released throughout 2021 <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/ROSK">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
