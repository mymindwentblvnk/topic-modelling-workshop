His interest in music started at an early age. But his love for the hardcore sound developed during the famous raves in the former hardcore temple, The Peppermill. At the beginning of 2002 he started to with spinning the wheels himself and he bought his first set of turntables. After he finished his studies “Graphical Management”, the time spend behind these tables only grew. 

At May 2nd 2003 he got his first gig, and at the end of May 2003 he organized his own party called “Supreme Hardcore”, which is still being held nowadays. 

At a dj contest in September 2003, which was being held by TW-magazine in cooperation with U-H-M, Mr. Sinister came in second. From that time on he came in contact with U-H-M/ Raving Nightmare of which he has been a resident from that time on. Because of this he has been able to play at loaded parties many times now and in different locations, such as the Maastrich Music Hall( former Platte Zoal), Happy Dayzz venue, Rijnhal (Arnhem), Club X, Time Out, Tarm Centre and Mecc Maastricht to name just a few. 

The biggest gigs so far have been all Raving Nightmare party’s he played at since he became a resident of U-H-M. And of course the gigs at the Thunderdome stage at the Nature One festival in Germany in 2004, 2006 and 2007. Also the B-day party’s from J.D.A. and Tommyknocker are very memorable.

Nowadays he also manages the label for Underground House Movement. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mr.+Sinister">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
