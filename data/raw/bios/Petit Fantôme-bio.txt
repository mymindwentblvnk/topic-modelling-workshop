Petit Fantôme is the solo breakaway Pierre Loustaunau (Crane Angels, François and the Atlas Moutains) who puts his poetry and grace in the service of an intimate pop handmade. Often dreamlike, sometimes melancholy, he invites us in its first test in the depths of his soul with songs made of odds and ends.
