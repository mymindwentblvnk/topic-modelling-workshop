An 80's inspired Future/Retro project from Detroit. Blending rich, saturated synthesizer tones that interweave melodies with guitar fantasies, Phaserland hopes to invoke wonder, nostalgia, future love and a place where melodies and atmospheres take you to places you have only dreamed of. A place of neon hope, fantastic landscapes and childhood fantasies. Have Fun with this experience, and please support him if you enjoy. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Phaserland">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
