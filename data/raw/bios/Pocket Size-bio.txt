Pocket Size is the name of a pop music duo from England featuring producer/musician Darren Pearson and singer Liz Overs. In 1999 they hit #1 on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart with "Walking" on Atlantic Records. The track 'Human Touch' was featured in the independent Brit movie 'Virtual Sexuality' and in an episode of supernatural TV series 'Charmed'.

After the sole album "100% Human", the duo left Atlantic Records and changed band name to Baby Jupiter. After the release of the 'Shivering' e.p. the band headed for the coast where they've been spotted skipping through the surf and staring out to sea. The pair are currently writing and performing in the southeast of England. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pocket+Size">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
