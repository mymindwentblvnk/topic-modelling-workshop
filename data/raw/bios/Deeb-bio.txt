Danny van den Hoek, known as DeeB, is a Dutch composer and producer of laidback electronic music/beats in the genres between hiphop and triphop. He is known for his typical organic style of morphing his sampled sounds, which are mostly found on old records and field recordings. He has released several solo and collaboration projects on various labels such as Caf√© del Mar, Chillhop Records, Dusted Wax Kingdom, Cult Classic Records and his own Phonophanatic label.
In 2012 his self-released "Daydream EP" was quickly picked up by Dusted Wax Kingdom and spread across the web, his 2nd EP "Thru Nature" was also released on the Dusted Wax label and Deeb became a more and more known name in the scene. After two EP-releases on UK labels and a third one on Dusted Wax he made contact with Chillhop Records. After a few features on a number of their compilations Deeb released his first full-length vinyl release "Slowmocean" on Chillhop Records in 2016.
This year Deeb has released a collaboration lyrical/rap project with AnonymousMusik from Los Angeles and two new EP's are on their way to all digital outlets and vinyl/cassette. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Deeb">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
