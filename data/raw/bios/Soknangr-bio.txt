Soknangr is a metal band from Kaupanger in Sogn, Norway, formed by Vegard Olsen and Jon Ole Bjørkum in 2007. They have released one demo "Vassløysa". There you can hear 8 home made songs that are inspirable locaded in our town, Kaupanger. A new demo, is under production, and will be recorded as soon as posible. 
Winter 2010 Soknangr decided to remaster the first demo before going to studio. so hopefully the bad sound got a little better. Hope you'll enjoy it.

Hail Noreg!!
