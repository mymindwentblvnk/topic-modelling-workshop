The Rippingtons are a contemporary jazz group, often considered Smooth Jazz. Formed in 1986 by guitarist and band leader Russ Freeman (not to be confused with the jazz pianist of the same name), their career has, so far, now spanned more than two decades. In the early to mid '90s they were more of a jazz/rock instrumental band, but since 1999 they have developed into more Smooth Jazz. Many of their songs have also been played during The Weather Channel's local forecast segments.
