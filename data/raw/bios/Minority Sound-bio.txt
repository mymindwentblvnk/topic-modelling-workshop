An electro/metal project founded in Prague in 2007. The trigger of Minority Sound was pulled by two members of Czech underground scene, Ota - bass guitarist from grind band Poppy Seed Grinder (ex Rites of Undeath) and Gulesh - member of Sin.teX (ex Return to Innocence and Rites of Undeath). Combining tones of sample sounds with sharp guitar riffs, it is obvious that Minority Sound are influenced by such bands like Pain, Fear Factory or Static X.
