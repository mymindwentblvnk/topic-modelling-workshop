Yet another Thrash Metal-band? Yes,but LOST WORLD ORDER is neither a
 retro-group living in the past nor a modern stakkato-band. The quartet
 based in Bielefeld, Germany, is stuck in the present, delivers killer riffs and
 lets litres of sweat flow whenever it hits the stage.

 LOST WORLD ORDER was founded in early 2008, and only a few months
 later the debut-album „This Apparatus Must Be Earthed!“ saw the light of
 day. The band’s name embodies pure desperation caused by the current
 political and social situation, what becomes obvious in the lyrics of the
 debut.
 On „This Apparatus Must Be Earthed!“ the band shot straight against
 George W. Bush, while on the latest release „Marauders“ the whole world is
 challenged. All songs on the album belong to a concept, which is set in a
 dystopian future after the third World War had taken place. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lost+World+Order">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
