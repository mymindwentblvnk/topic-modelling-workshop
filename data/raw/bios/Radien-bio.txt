Radien, a five-piece band from Helsinki, Finland was founded in 2014 and gained its present form in early 2016. 

Delivering crushing heaviness and having its roots in doom, sludge, punk and drone, Radien has shown its sonic strength live on stages around Finland.

Debut EP "Maa" was released September 2016 through Bandcamp. 

The single "Hiljaisuus" released in late 2017 to prepare listeners for the upcoming debut album which was recorded in the same sessions.

Finally, April 20th 2018 saw the release of "Syvyys", co-released with Black Bow Records (digital) and Bunkkeri Records (12" vinyl). The release followed a mini tour with Ward and Sunniva across Finland. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/radien">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
