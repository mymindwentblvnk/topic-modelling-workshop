Although springing from the era of the first wave of Norwegian black metal in the early 90's, Wallachia, named after the southern region of Romania that was formed in the fourteenth century, are one of the lesser acknowledged acts. 

The band's sound is notably dark in power, but also carries a few symphonic elements. A slight death metal influence is presented in the vocals.   

Their album, From Behind the Light, was released on small label Velvet International in 1999 and quickly went out of print. The band have since disappeared, but Dark Horizon Records has reissued this worthy black metal effort and adds the tracks from Wallachia's 1996 demo as a bonus.

Having existed in the shadows ever since From Behind the Light was released back in the day, Wallachia is back with two albums written.

A new album was released in April 2009 after countless delays and struggles with (lack of) line-up. Featuring a session-drummer, Ceremony of Ascension was recorded in Salzburg, Austria with Stefan of Golden Dawn engineering and co-producing the album. The music on this opus have been created between 1998 and 2004.

The next album is scheduled for 2012. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wallachia">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
