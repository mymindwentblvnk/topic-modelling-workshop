LUZABRIL, argentine singer and composer, launched her career as a solo artist in 2005 with the production "Ecléctica" (eclectic) winning herself  a place in the national rock scene. After appearing in diverse spots in Buenos Aires, the artist decided to get  away from those scenes to dedicate herself to the search for new material oriented towards hard rock and conceived tuning in to  the singers who are her   true musical influences, Evanescence, Linkin Park and Nightwish among others. In this way she began to work on the production of her new album, adding to her team guitarist Lopa Sanchez as producer and musical director, who together with  Lito Lopez, pianist of the band, were in charge of the musical composition, allowing Luzabril to give her full attention to the  composition of the lyrics. In “Cazador de Sueños”, (The Dream Catcher) Luzabril consolidates her roll definitively as author and shows us through her words a different view of certain aspects of human relations. In January of 2007, Luzabril began to record “Cazador de Sueños” at "Del Abasto al Pasto” studios and "Mandarina" to release it that year.
