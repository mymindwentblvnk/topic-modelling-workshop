There are multiple artists under this name:
1) Stratosphere started over 12 years ago with creating musical compositions. These were experimental songs, in which he discovered the multiple methods of soundcreation and production. The first few tracks were more in the industrial direction. With the purchase of his first soundmodule, things went rolling. More melancholic sounds were created and the first soundscapes came to life. Through his higher education years, his musical direction was found, and with the growth of his equipement, the ideas went in the same direction. He met a friend which started a radioprogram concisting of dark ambient, spherical, and experimental music. He encouraged him to go and seek further. Through this friend, Stratosphere came in contact with Vidna Obmana. With Vidna Obmana's help and advice, things went really rolling.

2) A pseudonym for house producer Kerri Chandler, used on his "Stratosphere" EP released in 1994 <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Stratosphere">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
