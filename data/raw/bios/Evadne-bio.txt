Hexenprozesse (first name of the band) was born in 2000. This name was changed to Evadne, which was an expression of sorrow, death and suicide how the end of this demigoddess of Greek mythology. This name expressed all we wanted at that moment. Under this new name the band released their first demo (In The Bitterness Of Our Souls), which was produced by Evadne and recorded, mixed and mastered by Alfonso A. This demo was released in a limited edition of 1000 copies. This demo has 3 songs plenty of darkness and sadness with a well defined between doom and gothic metal. If you want to enjoy our dark and melancholy atmospheres. After a time showing the demo”In the Bitterness Of Our Souls ” for several cities of the Iberian lands playing with national and international scene's bands, the band decided to shape what today is our new work, our first length called “The 13th Condition”. The new album was recorded, mixed and mastered by Alfons A. again. To this work we have the Lady Nott's collaboration (Narsilion) to the feminine voices and violin and the artwork was made by Morgana of Iberian Black Arts ( My Dying Bride, Vesperian Sorrow, Ancient, Aesma Daeva,... ). During the recording the band suffered a change in the keyboards, Jessie was changed by a friend of the band named Ethenmar. This 9-song album is full of darkness, sadness, melancholy, rage and pain, with depressive letters and hard parts that transmit something that somehow right now is a part of Evadne. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Evadne">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
