The One AM Radio is the project of singer/composer Hrishikesh Hirway. Hrishikesh often has friends accompany him live and on recordings but, in general, he sings, plays most of the instruments, and produces all the beats. His music blends acoustic and electronic elements and has drawn comparisons to a diverse array of artists, from Nick Drake to Portishead to Sigur Ros.

The One AM Radio has released 3 full-lengths: This Too Will Pass (2007), A Name Writ In Water (2004), and The Hum of the Electric Air! (2002); a split 7" with Ted Leo, and a 7" on Troubleman Unlimited, as part of their Solo Singles Series (along with The Album Leaf, Bob Nanna, Tim Kinsella, Tara Jane O'Neil) and another split 7" with Jeromes Dream on Alone Records. The One AM Radio has remixed and been remixed by a number of other artists. Daedelus enlisted Hrishikesh as a guest collaborator for a track on his album Exquisite Corpse. 

The son of Indian immigrants, Hrishikesh was born and raised in Massachusetts. After graduating from Yale, and after many brief stints in several cities, Hrishikesh eventually relocated to Los Angeles, where he currently resides.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+One+AM+Radio">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
