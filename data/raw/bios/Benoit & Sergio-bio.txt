Hailing from Washington DC, Benoit & Sergio are an electronic-pop duo whose sound owes as much to Galaxie 500 or The Jesus & Mary Chain as to any house or techno pioneers. Their debut EP, "What I've Lost," was released in November of 2009 on Bruno Pronsato's record label, thesongsays. Boldly unfashionable, What I've Lost is  a rich and charismatic record that effortlessly brings a pop sensibility to a techno framework. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Benoit+&+Sergio">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
