Dean Blunt is British musician, singer-songwriter, record producer, and conceptual artist Roy Nnawuchi (born in Hackney, north London). Blunt is best known for both his solo work and his partnership-based creations with avant-garde groups Hype Williams (featuring himself and Inga Copeland) and more recently, Babyfather; he was also the co-founder of London rock band Graffiti Island. He has been described as "a prolific, category-rejecting artist" and "an art-pop provocateur."

Blunt embarked on his solo career in 2011, releasing a set of albums as well as several EPs and singles. His full-length studio albums, The Narcissist II (2012), The Redeemer (2013), and Black Metal (2014), received attention and praise from various music publications.

Blunt has also hosted conceptual art exhibitions in the past, an example of this is a minimalist exhibition displaying a building site hoarding wall accompanied by a crowd dispersal alarm.[citation needed].

Blunt is also known for his playfulness and obfuscation. In 2015, he sent his bodyguard to accept his Philip Hall Radar Award at the NME awards.  In 2016, he listed a toy Foxtons estate agents Mini Cooper filled with marijuana on eBay.  At a New York concert, in March 2016, media guests were asked to check in under aliases that they had received with their ticket confirmations. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dean+Blunt">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
