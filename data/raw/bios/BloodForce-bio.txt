Formed in July 19, 2014 BloodForce is a Brutal Death Metal band from North Carolina with members from Lumberton, Fayetteville and Fairmont. We are into all kinds of metal but our favorites are death metal, black metal, power metal and thrash metal. we try to incorporate all of those genres within our music while maintaining the brutality. We record, master, produce and distribute ourselves however we are open to becoming a part of something bigger, so if you like what you hear and you feel we can help each other grow and better our businesses please contact us.
