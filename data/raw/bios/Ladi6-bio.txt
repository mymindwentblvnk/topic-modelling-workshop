Ladi6 is one of New Zealand's premier vocalists and MCs.

Starting her musical career in Christchurch, New Zealand, Ladi6 was part of the all-girl hip-hop group Sheelahroc. Sheelahroc had the hit track "If I Gave You The Mic" and Ladi6 was nominated for Best Vocalist/MC at the 2003 bNet music awards.

Ladi6 then moved to Auckland with her band Verse Two who quickly gained a reputation as a top New Zealand live soul/hip-hop group. They won the bNet best new act award in 2004, toured New Zealand with packed shows and supported international acts such as The Roots and De La Soul.

Ladi6's vocals feature on stand-out tracks by some of Aotearoa's finest talent, including Shapeshifter, Scribe, Fat Freddys Drop and 50 Hz.

Ladi6 is currently recording her debut solo album with Mu from Fat Freddy's Drop and Parks. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ladi6">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
