Behind the name Triple X are two Italian producers that have come out of the crossover period from old to new millenium: Luca Moretti and Ricky Romanini. It all began in June 1999, when their first production "Feel The Same" was licensed to the top English label Ministry of Sound, went to No. 1 in the UK Club Chart and No. 32 in the UK Official Singles chart. The song featured a sample of "You And I" by Delegation and vocals by J.D. Braithwaite. In the same period, Luca and Ricky remixed "Get Get Down" by Paul Johnson, a huge worldwide hit. That version soon became the DJs' favourite mix and in several countries such as France, it was released as the main version. From that moment on, all Triple X remixes held a certain position on the world dance scene, collaborating with the biggest names in the business. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Triple+X">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
