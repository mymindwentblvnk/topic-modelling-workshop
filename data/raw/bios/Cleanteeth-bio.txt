Cleanteeth's highly-anticipated first album demands attention. This is 42 minutes of sinister doom metal combined with bruising rhythms and raucous swells played on four stacks higher than the tallest band member. Within the first 10 seconds of Cleanteeth's feature debut, 'Pushing Rope', thunderous riffs echo out of three guitars while ominous licks force heads to bang with rhythmic precision. Fans will recognize influences ranging from Will Haven, KEN Mode, Harkonen and Harvey Milk to Breather Resist, Gaza, and Godflesh, yet Cleanteeth's sound is uniquely its own--a crushingly beautiful array of electric noise and soul-punching drum beats that will make you want to break something. And come back frothing at the mouth for more...

Formed in 2008, Cleanteeth is a massive sonic quintet comprised of veterans in the New York metal scene, featuring members of Goes Cube, Hull, Destructo Swarmbots, Godmaker, and White Widows.
