Zune is a project born in April 2002, with the following line up: Alberto (v), Matteo (gt), Umberto (gt), Loris (dr) and Stefano (bs). In the same period Zune records (live) the first promo in this days of oblivion, apreciated by burning Season records (Austria). Between July and September 2002, Zune plays with INSTIL (Holland), TODIEFOR (Italy), THE SECRET (ex-From the dying sky), TROWDOWN, 18 VISION (USA) and many other bands. After this period Umberto end Stefano split out. Unfortunately, due to the line-up problems, Zune could not carry out many opportunity. But, after a long period of inactivity, during the year 2003/2004 they compose a few of new songs, very influenced by death-metal. The result of that work is 20 minutes before night falls, colder and stronger than the first promo. Actually Cris and Matteo plays guitar, Stefano plays bass, Loris Plays drums and Alberto sings. Now Zune is on stage again and has already played with A TRAITOR LIKE JUDAS, BLEEDING HORIZON, A FLOWER KOLLAPSED, THE PHOENIX...
