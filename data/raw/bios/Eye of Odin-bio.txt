1. Eye of Odin’s unique sound, called “Victory Metal” by the band, is defined by a stark fusion of modern metal and rock conventions with traditional folk-style elements: pounding metal drums and heavy, psychedelic breakdowns blended with folk-style songwriting metered by progressive twists; traditional singing styles and harmonies blended with with intense growling vocals; historical lyrical themes blended with infectiously catchy sing-along melodies.

Eye of Odin was founded in the summer of 2008 and has been playing live shows since Halloween of 2009; in such a short time they have gained attention and praise for their unique costumed stage-presence and infectiously memorable, sing-along sound. During a Vancouver Island mini-tour with City of Fire, vocalist Burton C. Bell (City of Fire, Fear Factory, The Ascension of the Watchers) referred to the band as “the incomparable Eye of Odin.”

Eye of Odin has recently signed to Shostroud Productions; their soon-to-be-released debut album, Winterborn, was recorded with Sho Murray at Stone Canyon Studios in Vancouver. The album is now available for purchase from eyeofodin.ca, Itunes, and Tunecore: http://www.tunecore.com/widgets/show/44322
