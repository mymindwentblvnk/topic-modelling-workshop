Rick Holland has been a serial collaborator since he started writing poems, and has worked with Brian Eno since 2002, under the name Brian Eno And The Words Of Rick Holland.

It has always been Rick's aim to bridge some of the stickier history of 'poetry' and present it in new forms. His poetry seethes with honesty and reflects his own wish to read poetry that does not rely for reference on an in depth knowledge of any small or specialized world.
