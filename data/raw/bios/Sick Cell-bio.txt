Sick Cell play a danceable mix of synth driven Post-Punk electronic
music. Their influences are varied and include Bauhaus, Young L and
Light Asylum.
This Brooklyn trio creates reverberating contagious beats with ear
bending guitar and synth hooks. Add singer/ songwriter Angelo Tursiâ€™s
darkly slick lyrics and hauntingly erotic vocals and you will find yourself
lost in a Darktronic frenzy.

Sick Cell are Angelo Tursi, Eric White, and Shane LaRue. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/sick+cell">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
