Established late 2008, Blind To Faith is a vehicle for pure, unadulterated metal punk. Stripped down to the very core and essence, Blind To Faith wears its influences on its sleeve: Discharge, Repulsion, Celtic Frost, Eyehategod, Gehenna, Darkthrone, Entombed, and Today Is The Day, to name a few. Written and recorded in less than 3 days, the 12" The Seven Fat Years Are Over showcases the primitive one-track mind of it's creators. Having rid themselves from any sort of preset agenda like playing live or making friends, Blind To Faith offers its art as real as it gets: lawless, violent and pure. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Blind+To+Faith">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
