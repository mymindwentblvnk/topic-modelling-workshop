Christbait were a metal band from Melbourne, Australia. They have long since broken up, and members have moved on to other acts such as Dern Rutledge, Magnacite and Demonother. 

Formed in 1989, Christbait began as a grind/death metal band, but evolved into a hybrid of stoner rock, groove metal and grind. They released one demo in 1991, an ep entitled Yeast in 1992 (Later to be lampooned by fellow Melbourne grind/rock band Blood Duster with their own ep called Yeest). Christbait finally self-released their only album, Dirtypunkmutha in 1996 after 2 years of on-again, off-again recording and mixing. Unfortunately, the band split up the same year. 

A highly underrated band! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Christbait">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
