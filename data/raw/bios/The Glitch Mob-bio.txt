The Glitch Mob is a three-piece electronic group from Los Angeles, California, composed of Ed Ma (edIT), Justin Boreta (Boreta) and Josh Mayer (OOah). The group, originally a four-piece including Kraddy, was formed in 2006 within the burgeoning Los Angeles bass-driven 'beat' scene. The Glitch Mob made a name for themselves playing live, choosing to perform with laptops and MIDI controllers. They have won fans through showcasing their chosen technology during performance solos gaining attention in Los Angeles and San Francisco, eventually touring more widely along the West Coast and then to various festivals worldwide. 
The group's debut album, Drink The Sea, debuted on the iTunes Electronic Chart at number five and peaked on the CMJ Top 200 Chart for College Radio at #57. The album's debut led Electronic Musician to run a cover story on the trio.
