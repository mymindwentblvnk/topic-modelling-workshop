T++ refers to Torsten Pröfrock (aka Various Artists, Dynamo, Erosion, Resilent, Traktor). He was also a member of the Monolake duo. He started to release techno record on Berlin's well known Chain Reaction label in the mid 1990s. Subsequent releases were mainly done using the Dynamo-pseudonym and focused on a special take of breakbeat techno. Sometime after 2000 Pröfrock officially joined the project of his friend Robert Henke and played a couple of gigs as part of Monolake. In the last few years there have been a few one-off 12' releases as T++ which have had the best resonance in the dubstep affiliated scene. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/T%252B%252B">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
