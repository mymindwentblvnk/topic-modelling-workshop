Neverstar is a female fronted hard rock band from the UK described as “Evanescence meets Godsmack”. The band was officially formed mid 2009, but has been a six year ambition of founding members, Pieter and Vega.

Led by Vega’s passionate vocals Neverstar has played some of London’s most prestigious venues and has built a reputation as a band destined for big things.

The band's signature sound is inspired by classical and symphonic tones combined with pounding guitars and immense vocal melodies. Neverstar masterfully mixes emotion with theatrical settings and dark characteristics, which is amplified by ear splitting yet melodic guitar riffs. On stage, they convey electric energy, leaving the audience captivated and entertained.

Following on from a very successful demo release in 2011, Neverstar entered the studio to record a new single earlier this year with producer Neil Haynes whose recent credentials include The Fallen, Awake, Doctor Fonda and Dead Man’s Crossing. The single ‘Lose Control’ will be released on Monday 22 October of 2012, accompanied by a fan inspired music video shortly after.

The first and title track on the single “Lose Control” is a powerful and energetic song that hits you straight in the chest with an uplifting drum beat and pulsing guitar riff. The track is complemented by Vega’s sweet vocals skilfully layered on top. This hard driving song urges the audience to let it all go and lose control.

A second track “Forgotten” is included in the single. The track has a distinct groove written to make any audience bounce to the beat. It tells a heartfelt story of overcoming constant criticism and being told that you’re just not good enough.

This band is definitely good enough, and for them, this is just the beginning. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Neverstar">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
