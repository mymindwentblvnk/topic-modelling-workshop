Consisting of Steven Ansell (vocals and drums) and Laura-Mary Carter (vocals and guitar), they formed in Brighton, 2005 after their previous bands (Cat On Form and Lady Muck respectively) had broken up and they decided to "have a jam".

They have performed many, many live shows to date and initially released four 7" records on different independent labels (Jonson Family, Try Harder, Abeano/XL, Drowned in Sound). They were signed to V2 with whom they released the singles It's Getting Boring By The Sea (June 11, 2007) and I Wish I Was Someone Better (October 29, 2007).

Their debut album Box Of Secrets was finally released in April 2008 on Mercury Records, where they were transferred to following the sale of V2 to Universal.

Their second album Fire Like This was released on 1 March 2010 to critical acclaim.

The single  It's Getting Boring By The Sea  is featured on the Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Blood+Red+Shoes">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
