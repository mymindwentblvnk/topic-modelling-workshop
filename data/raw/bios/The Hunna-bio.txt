The Hunna are a four-piece indie rock band from Hertfordshire, England. Singer/guitarist Ryan Potter, lead guitarist Dan Dorney, bassist Jermaine Angin, and drummer Jack Metcalfe quickly built a local following before teaming up with producer Tim Larcombe (Lana Del Rey, Halsey) to record their debut single. "Bonfires" and its B-side, "She's Casual," were released in October 2015, coinciding with the Hunna's first supporting tour with Bristol-based band Coasts. They spent much of 2016 in the studio recording their debut album 100, which saw release later the same year <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Hunna">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
