Yuri Eduardovich Loza (Russian: Ю́рий Эдуа́рдович Лоза) (born February 1, 1954) is a Soviet and Russian singer, poet and composer.

In 1983 he moved to Moscow with the purpose to enter the Russian Academy of Theatre Arts, but failed the entry exams and joined the rock band Зодчие. Soon his songs became the majority of the band's repertoire.

Since 1987 Loza sings solo. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/%D0%AE%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B9+%D0%9B%D0%BE%D0%B7%D0%B0">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
