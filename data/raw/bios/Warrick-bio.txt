Warrick is a American Thrash Metal band from Miami. (2004-2013)

This band started back in high school, just a bunch of headbangers that wanted to wreck some havoc and have fun. In 2005 and we played and booked our very first show in churchill's pub December 8th  2005 1 year after Dimebag Darrell's passing from the mighty pantera. Ever since, we've played as many shows as we can trough the years, from fancy venues to backyards, to big crowds and national acts, to 2 person crowds and generators running our 5 minute sets being shut down by police. Back then there was very few to no metal bands in south florida, no scene, it was all emo/screamo indy etc, but we still managed to get out there and melt peoples faces. 

Unfortunately we are currently on hiatus. To all our fans and people who have listened to our music, gone to our shows, heard of our band, thank you for all the support and everything you guys did for us, we are eternally grateful.
