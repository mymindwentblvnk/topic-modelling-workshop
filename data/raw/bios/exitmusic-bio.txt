Exitmusic was a dream pop band consisting of Aleksa Palladino and Devon Church. They formed in 2003 and were based in Brooklyn, New York. Their debut LP, "Passage" was released on May 22, 2012 on Secretly Canadian.

Exitmusic wrote and recorded the follow-up to "Passage" but the project was left unfinished when Palladino and Church separated. The band went on hiatus while Church worked on solo projects and Palladino pursued acting, appearing in "Boardwalk Empire" and "Halt and Catch Fire," among other film and TV projects. Palladino and Church revisited the recordings six years later, and the album, titled "The Recognitions," was finally released in 2018.
