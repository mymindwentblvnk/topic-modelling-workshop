Title Tracks emerged in mid-2008 from the still-smoldering ashes of Georgie James. After years of co-writing songs with Q And Not U, Georgie James and others, John Davis began to focus his energy exclusively on solo material. On the Title Tracks debut single, "Every Little Bit Hurts", John displays an almost scientific approach to song-writing. Bits and pieces and diverse influences culled from such wells as; a holy-grail-stocked record collection; a moonlighting gig as a radio disc jockey; and more than a decade of touring and recording in the US, Europe and beyond, have all served to hone John's musical vocabulary into a powerful and engaging instrument. 

While John is the writer/arranger behind Title Tracks he is joined live (and on the debut single) by Andrew Black (drums), Michael Cotterman (bass) and Merideth Munoz (organ/guitar/vox), all friends from the D.C. music scene. 

"Every Little Bit Hurts" b/w "Found Out" was recorded and produced in October 2008 at Silver Sonya by Chad Clark and Nick Anderson and was released on Dischord Records on April 6, 2009.

It Was Easy was released by Ernest Jenning Record Co. Feb 9, 2010.
