Murder Intentions from Belgium started out late 2004 as a bunch of friends playing pissed off brutal death metal mixed up with touches of grind and hardcore.
After 2 demos, a couple of line-up changes and a whole lot of shows the band finally released its debut album “A prelude to total decay” on november 16th 2009 through SFC records.

“A prelude to total decay” was recorded early 2009 by Niek Tournois (Spoil engine) at the Sweet sour studio in Eede (NL) and later on masterd by Robbe K (Disavowed, Arsebreed) at Audiovizualz.
The album features guest vocals by Pieter, Tim (Outcast / Whatever it takes) and Maenhoudt (Saviour) as well as a guest appearance by Voidwork in the form of 3 noisy and dark ambient tracks.

Currently the band is writing new material for a split cd (fall 2011) and second full length album.
With alot of new influences to the band, the music is shaping up more technical, more varied and intenser than ever before.
