Mike Dale, Chris Brewer and Pat Brewer make up the group Glenmore, a Rock band from Brixham, Devon.
Formed in early 2014 after recording material together for Mikeâ€™s University project. All three members have been playing music together from a young age, performing in numerous local bands. The most recent being Guilt-Trip, a heavy metal who had a record contract and released their only album back in 2008. Although the album was received well by critics the group lost interest in the project.

Glenmore, unlike Guilt-Trip, are a more mellower style of music, utilising the groups other talents with other instruments. Taking influences from groups like Alter Bridge, Alice in Chains, Foo Fighters and U2 the band are trying a contemporary style of music. However as a group the use their eclectic taste in music, ranging from funk, country, soul, rock and pop to create a unique style of music.
