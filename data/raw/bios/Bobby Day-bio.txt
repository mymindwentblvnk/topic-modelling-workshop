Born Robert James Byrd in Fort Worth, Texas, he moved to Los Angeles, California at the age of fifteen. As a member of the R&B group, the Hollywood Flames, he used the stage name Bobby Day to perform and record. He went several years with minor musical success limited to the West Coast, including being the original "Bob" in the duo Bob & Earl. In 1957, Day formed his own band called the "Satellites" following which he authored three songs that are seen today as rock and roll classics.

Bobby Day's best known songwriting efforts were "Over and Over" made popular by the Dave Clark Five in 1965 and "Little Bitty Pretty One" popularized by Thurston Harris in 1957, Clyde McPhatter in 1962 and the Jackson Five in 1972. However, Day is most remembered for his 1958 solo recording of the Billboard Hot 100 No. 2 hit, "Rockin' Robin", a song covered by Michael Jackson in 1972.

Sometimes referred to as a one-hit wonder, despite numerous recordings with a variety of record companies, after "Rockin' Robin", Bobby Day never achieved a Top 40 hit again.
