Final Fortune got its start in June of 2007 when long time friends Allan and Shane reunited to "put the band back together".  After reorganizing and picking out a few riffs, working on covers, and collaboration of efforts, Allan and Shane added drummer Hershel to the mix in July of 2008.  Shortly after that, responding to an ad at a local music store, Shane ""T2" joined the band on vocals and songwriting.  After two months Final Fortune had added 10 originals to their repertoire, largely in part to the vast store of lyrics T2 already had written.

In October 2008 Final Fortune added a new drummer, Twitch, a drumline trained master of trills and offered Hershel a position on bass or percussion.  He didn't accept and Final Fortune had their first member leave.

In December 2008, Final Fortune added Stanley, a 30 year veteran on the bass and Final Fortune was finally realized.

Final Fortunes standards were to not be a bar band (live jukebox) and had no intention of sounding like anyone else on the market.  Both principles have been achieved and Final Fortune is now a force to be reckoned with.
