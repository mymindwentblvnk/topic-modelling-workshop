Jennie Tebler, was a friend of the late Quorthon (frontman for the pioneering black and viking metal band, Bathory) who famously played sessions on her early materials.

Tebler has just released an EP called "Silverwing," a tribute to her unfortunately deceased friend. She is currently signed to Black Mark Records, the company she worked for before she started a musical career. She also has performed with Lake of Tears as a guest vocalist.
