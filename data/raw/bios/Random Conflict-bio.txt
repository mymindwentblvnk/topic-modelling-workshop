Random Conflict began life in late 2005 and started the long process of writing, rehearsing, recording and working as hard as possible to play the music they love. Throughout these two years, countless shows across the length of the UK, including two full UK tours, have seen Random Conflict sharing the stage with the likes of All Shall Perish (USA), The Chariot (USA), Becoming The Archetype (USA), MyChildren MyBride (USA), Knights of the Abyss (USA), An Albatross (USA), Eternal Lord, Azriel, Centurion, Shaped By Fate, Sylosis, Viatrophy, Clone The Fragile, Your Demise, Brutality Will Prevail, Test Switch Isolator, Skindred, Murder One, Annotations of an Autopsy, The Argent Dawn and hundreds more.
Emerging as one of the leaders in a strong Midlands metal scene, Random Conflict have carved out a reputation for combining passionate, brutal songs with an intense and energetic live show. With a well received Self-Titled EP under their belt coupled with the imminent release of a Split EP with The Bridal Procession, Random Conflict have cemented themselves as favourites amongst fans, promoters and bands alike.

An ambitious European touring schedule, hard work ethic and a sense of humour make 2008 look to be Random Conflict's year.
