Inventing a whole new rank to the mass that is 21st century Hardcore and Metal music, Lysistrata will bridge, rather than fall through, the gaps that seperate the oh-so-similar styles to stand their place along side the true "Metalcore" bands.

Combining the Metal and Hardcore genres, Lysistrata appeals to both with a powerful array of breakdowns, 2-step, and pitting instances. Backing their music is an unbelievably energetic and entertaining show that will have everyone in the crowd pleased to bear witness.

Originating straight from of the heart of Northern California, Lysistrata plans to take their brutally intense and original sound from the town of Chico to the music collection of every genuine "fan of the arts".

Under the title "Lysistrata" since the summer of 2005, the incredibly archetypal group is formed by experienced and enthused musicians who have been playing together for many years and have each taken part in countless other projects.

Each piece that is written is supported by elaborate imagery and stories, as well as personal experiences that come from the combined and individually artistic members. Right down to every riff, the amount of emotion and energy contributed to the band, deems the members worthy of the pride, professionalism and drive that surrounds Lysistrata. With a past behind each member of artistic views and opinions, they have an understanding of persistence and pursuing desired achievements. As their main focus, Lysistrata will strive for hardearned greatness and act upon every opportunity that comes their way.

Influenced by ZAO, As I lay Dying, CONVERGE, Between the Buried and Me, In Flames, Lamb of God, and the Dillinger Escape Plan. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lysistrata">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
