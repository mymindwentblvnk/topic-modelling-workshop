If there is one thing that is certain, it is that Jarah brings to the music scene a different kind of flavor. 

She was born an Aquarius back in 1987, drawing her first breath around 8:59 PM during one of the most treacherous winter blizzards, on February 8th. As a child, Jarah was always mystically drawn towards all things of musical nature. During her high school years, she became...well...for lack of better words, a "huge band geek". However, It wasn't until the ripe age of 18 that Jarah realized she had a special talent. She traded in her instruments of choice for an even more intriguing one..her voice.

Jarah found she had a vocal and lyrical talent, and after some self training and hard work, she was ready to share this talent. However, it wasn't until late 2007, when she was 20, that she made her first recording. Helping her insight, and leaving her alone...clinging viciously to a new thirst for music, that gave her no choice but to continue to pursue her newfound talent and skill. 

Jarah started production on her own in early 2008. With no training or equipment, it proved to be challenging. After a few cracks at a decent track, Jarah realized her natural talents were starting her on an unbelievably amazing journey into her own new world of music! Jarah is in the process of completing her very first demo CD. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jarah">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
