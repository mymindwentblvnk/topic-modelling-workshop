1. Tiananmen are a Sheffield-based rock fusion band who promise great things. After releasing their debut ep entitled "The mechanical light of a futureless skyline", the group have set about small UK tours along with plenty of gigs in their hometown. 

Before forming in April 2006, the bulk of the band existed in various forms with Lee (guitar) and Jamie (drums) collaborating with many members before finding Ben (bass), and later, after a long search, Nate on vocals.

The fuzzy chaos of Thursday is combined with all-encompassing lyrics reminiscent of Thrice, alongside Funeral for a friend-esque empassioned vocals to influence a truly original industrial sound. 
Tiananmen are currently recording their debut album at their project studio. Tracks will be available real soon!
