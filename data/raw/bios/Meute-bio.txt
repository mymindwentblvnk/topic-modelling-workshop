MEUTE is a Techno Marching Band - a dozen drummers and horn players from Hamburg/Germany who fulfil the job of a dj with their acoustic instruments. The archaic conglomerate of brass and drums creates a new genre by combining hypnotic driving techno and expressive brass band music. MEUTE detaches electronic music from the dj desk and evolves the thrust of energy on stage or directly in the crowd. No matter if in the countryside or in the club, with or without electricity â€“ MEUTE runs. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Meute">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
