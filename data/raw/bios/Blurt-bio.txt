Formed in 1979 by brothers Ted and Jake Milton with guitarist Peter Creese. The band made their recording debut on Factory Records, but released albums on many different labels throughout their thirty-year career. Over the years Ted Milton has kept the band going with several line-up changes, but maintaining the idiosyncrasy and originalty that has marked the Blurt sound from the very beginning. Blurt have a very strong live reputation and to this day still undertake annual tours.
