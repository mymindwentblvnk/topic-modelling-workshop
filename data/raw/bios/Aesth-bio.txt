Music is the way we choose to express our feelings, the path we took to provoke sensations. It's our perception of the world surrounding us.

Born in 2006, Aesth has found its way through the years. Rehearshals, shows and musical influences have define Aesth's music style. Going from mellow parts to loud & energic guitar riffs supported by hammering drums and bass lines, Aesth found the way to express their thoughts in music.

In the upcoming years, we hope to get you by our side.
