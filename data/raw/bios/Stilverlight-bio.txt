“…We’ll bring our flame to the distant skies…” STILVERLIGHT is a metal band from Saint-Petersburg, Russia. It was formed in 2009. By now the band has released EP “Bring The Flame”(2010) and internet single “One Night Before The Winter”(2010). For now there are three actual members of the band: Max Palanin (vocals, guitars), Igor Radomsky (guitars, backing vocals) and Ilya Osipenko (bass guitar, backing vocals). The music of STILVERLIGHT can be described as a “melodic power metal with rock influences”. But someone could find some thrash, folk, heavy and speed metal elements. STILVERLIGHT is recording their first full-length album now which is going to be a completely new word from Russia on the world’s music stage.
