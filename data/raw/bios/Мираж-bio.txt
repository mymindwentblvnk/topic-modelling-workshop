Mirage (Мираж, Mirazh) were a 1980s Russian pop group founded in Moscow in 1986 by Russian composer-keyboard player Andrey Litjagin. The original lineup of Mirage included Litjagin, guitarist Sergey Proklov, lyricist Valery Sokolov, vocalist Natalia Gulkina and classically trained vocalist Margarita Suhankina. Their music came at a time when perestroika was radically changing the Soviet Union and their energetic disco sound captured the mood and feeling of their generation.

Mirage borrowed their musical style from other disco groups of the time such as Modern Talking and Bad Boys Blue. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/%D0%9C%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B6">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
