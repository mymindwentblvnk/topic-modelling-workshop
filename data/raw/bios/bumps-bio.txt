The three percussion experts behind the seminal indie rock / post rock band Tortoise showcase their rhythmical prowess, coming together for this self-titled concept break beat record entitled Bumps.

As members of Tortoise, these three gentlemen helped infuse a new aesthetic into the indie rock scene of the 1990s. The group set itself apart by focusing on instrumental prowess and group interaction. Instead of the tried and true themes of familiar alternative and punk, Tortoise opened up their scope of influences to create a new musical vision – dubiously called “post rock” – incorporating styles from genres such as Krautrock, dub, avant-garde jazz, classical minimalism, ambient and space music, film music and British electronica.

One of indie rock’s most in-demand master producers of the last decade, Tortoise’s producer/
drummer/vibes player John McEntire has worked with a staggering number of artists as engineer, producer and remixer. With Bumps, he lends his talents toward pushing the boundaries of a typical break beat record, fusing influences from funk, Brazilian, Latin and Afrobeat music.
