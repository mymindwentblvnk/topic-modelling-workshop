Snapper is a New Zealand indie/alternative band formed by Peter Gutteridge (previously in The Clean, The Chills and The Great Unwashed). Snapper's activity since the late 1990s has been sporadic at best. The Gutteridge-penned song "Gentle Hour" was covered by Yo La Tengo in 2009.

The band evolved from the line-up of another Gutteridge-led band, the Dunedin-based Phromes. A show supporting the Delawares featuring Christine Voice drew her melodic organ and haunting vocals to the fold and with input from Alan Haig on drums and Dominic Stones (who went on to the 3Ds) on guitar, the line-up was complete.

Snapper's first full-length album, Shotgun Blossom, was released in 1992 with the original line-up. The seven inch single "Vadar" b/w "Gentle Hour", was released in 1993 as the band began to fragment somewhat. 

The full-length album, A.D.M., was released in 1996 and is predominantly Gutteridge singing and playing all instruments with Mike Dooley on drums. Christine Voice, together with Demarnia Lloyd (from Cloudboy) and Celia Pavlova (from King Loser) feature as guest vocalists.

Although never completely defunct; Snapper's activity since the late 1990s has been sporadic at best. In 2000 the Gutteridge, Voice and Dooley line-up, with additional members Maxine Funke and Thomas Bell, came together to perform a show as part of Dunedin City's Festival of the Arts.

Snapper re-formed for a concert in Dunedin in July 2012, and toured the NZ North Island in February 2013.

The Gutteridge-penned song "Gentle Hour" was covered by Yo La Tengo on the 2009 collaborative album "Dark Was The Night".   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Snapper">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
