Enragement is a  four-piece brutal death metal band from Helsinki, Finland, on a mission to strain people's neck muscles and release them from the burden of dandruff. Our music combines various subgenres of death metal into a neckbreaking unity of brutality. Our songs differ from each other with their influences from such styles as technical, brutal, old school and slam death metal, black metal and grindcore and they all maintain the intense heavyness that prevents people from getting up from bed on Mondays... <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Enragement">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
