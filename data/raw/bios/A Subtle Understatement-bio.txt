The group begins at three : Sheb, Marco and Morgan. After several hearings of singers and drummers, they fell down on Jérémie (vocals) and Julien (drums), who joined to create "A Subtle Understatement". 

At the end of At World's End (the previous band) they deal with a style between metalcore and deathcore in alternating melody and brutality. 

Today, after 5 months of existence the young band recorded a 4 tracks demo at the "Dome Studio" to finally proceed to the stage.
