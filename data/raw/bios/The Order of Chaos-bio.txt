The Order of Chaos is a long standing and well-known Canadian hard rock band which originated in Stony Plain, Alberta. They have been working their way through clubs and bars in Western Canada since 2003.

The Band

Founding members John Simon Fallon and Sterling Burrows are today joined by drummer Tim Prevost and guitarist John Saturley.  Vocalist Amanda Kiernan is renowned for her ability to blend of various rock-metal vocal styles and is highly-regarded for her humble yet confident approach to her central role as the band's focal point.  The Order of Chaos has been featured at the Boonstock Music Festival and has performed with such world-renowned acts as Godsmack, Sonata Arctica, Paul Di’Anno (formerly of Iron Maiden), and Ensiferium.

Many of these opportunities have evolved from the band’s innate ability to captivate crowds. Their energetic, memorable performances and marketing savy have impressed audiences throughout Western Canada, and are beginning to attract the attention of audiences worldwide. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Order+of+Chaos">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
