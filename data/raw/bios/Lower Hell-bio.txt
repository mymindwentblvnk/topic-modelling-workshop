In winter 2004, four friends from south-west Germany decided to start a new metal project called LIES BEHIND THE SMILE. They explored new ways of musical expression and started the creative plan. After an intensive time of songwriting the band played their first show in March 2005. A free demo song AURORIX was recorded for a sampler. LIES BEHIND THE SMILE took part at the "kaba-rockt� newcomer festival with 80 other bands and made the successful third place.

A lot of shows followed until one former member left in summer 2005. In Fall 2005 the guitarist Bruno joined the band. He brought a lot of new influences and more metalpower. The four womanizers won a huge number of fans in the local scene and out of town. Than "BUD Joe SPENCER" supported the 4-string guitar to relieve the double-loaded bass and vocal member. This complete unity composed five songs and recorded the self produced promo CD "just to be sure� in Winter 2005/06. LIES BEHIND THE SMILE enjoyed with their powerful, passionate live-performance a lot of gigs with bands like TANKARD, FEAR MY THOUGHTS, NEAERA, MY DARKEST HATE, MAROON, END OF DAYS and many more.

After a new period of songwriting, the five beauties recorded 2007 the ultimate coma bell in cooperation with FEAR MY THOUGHTS (Century Media). Release will be in winter 2007/08. But LIES BEHIND THE SMILE felt that the name simply was not that fitting to their new brutal melodic death sound, they create. So, after an intense research, the five party sluts found a name that they thought would fit their idea of metal best and that was also adequate considering the message that the band want to get across their listeners. The new name was...
