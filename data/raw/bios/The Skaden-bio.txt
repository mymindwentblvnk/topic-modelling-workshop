The Skaden (formerly Eikenskaden) is the new black metal solo project of Stefan Kozak from Metz, Lorraine, France.  His debut album, 'You Will Hope I Had Died' was released on December 10th, 2009 by blackmetal.com records.  While Stefan writes and plays all of the music he enlisted several guest vocalist and lyricists on this album.  Sound-wise the album is a drastic change over the previous "There's No Light at the End of the Tunnel..." album as Eikenskaden.  This new album reveals a totally progressed sound venturing in the realms of shoe-gazing Post-Black Metal, but still retaining some distinctive Stefan Kozak signature sounds, namely his grim vocals and the French continental-oriented melodic distorted guitar which has evolved from the ultra-necro atmosphere of the original Les Legions Noire Underground.  Stefan also plays/played in Mystic Forest, Azerlath, Bolverk and Svartalvheim. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Skaden">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
