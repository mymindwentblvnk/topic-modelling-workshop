The four piece indie group from Portland, Oregon, released their debut album "Solid Guild" in 2003, receiving great reviews by Rolling Stone, The Hipster Filter & even The Washington Post. After touring with the likes of Weird War, Hot Hot Heat, and "label mates" The French Kicks, the band decided to take a break. A few months down the track, and one guitarist down The Joggers released their second album  "With a Cape and a Cane".

Darrell and Ben also play in their sideproject The Cajun Gems. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Joggers">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
