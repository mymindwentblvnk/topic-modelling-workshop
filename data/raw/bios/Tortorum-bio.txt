TORTORUM was formed in Bergen, Norway by Skyggen (guitars) in 2010, but the idea itself was born some years earlier. It was ALWAYS there. The driving force behind the band lies in the adoration of the Dark Side and hatred towards the weak and slavish religions, consuming in an abyss of disgust and mockery the fall of mankind with his rotten world and values. 

In 2010 Skyggen recorded an instrumental demo which was for private use and a few specially selected individuals only. A few months later Barghest (vocals) joins the band. In May 2011 Tortorum entered the studio to record their debut album entitled "Extinctionist", containing 9 hymns of furious and savage Black Metal. Skyggen recorded all guitars, Barghest - vocals, with Erik (session drums) taking care of artillery. The album was unleashed on World Terror Committee in April 2012. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tortorum">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
