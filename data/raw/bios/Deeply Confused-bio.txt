Hitting you like a slap in the face, Montreal, Quebec's Deeply Confused's sound is a mix of thrash, death and traditional metal, with a touch of keyboards adding an ambient/eerie flavor to the music. Born in 2005 from the collaboration of Stephan Filion (Tears for the Dead Gods, Up the Irons tribute to Iron Maiden) and Gabrielle Morin (drum goddess, nothing less!); they set out to create a band that would please themselves before anything else. Joining the fold came guitarist Pat Deno, who played with Stephan in various bands, vocalist Yan “Klimbo” T. (Trigger tribute to In Flames, Absonant Cadence) and bassist Philip Chown (Shop Ltd and session player). Deeply Confused recorded a first demo in their rehearsal room between July and August 2006. Featuring the 3 tracks “Seven rusty nails into your coffin”, “Five fallacious phrases for a fictional fortune” and “November 28th, daylight...”, the demo showed the potential of the band and was a great indication of things to come. In April 2007, Pat Deno left the band to pursue other interests. He was replaced by guitarist Fred Bergeron (Tears for the Dead Gods, Up the Irons tribute to Iron Maiden), bringing the final piece of the puzzle. It is with this lineup that Deeply Confused went on to release their first professionally recorded EP, “Isolated”, in June 2008.  On June 26th, 2010, a little more than two years after the release of their first EP, the band announced the end of Deeply Confused on their MySpace. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Deeply+Confused">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
