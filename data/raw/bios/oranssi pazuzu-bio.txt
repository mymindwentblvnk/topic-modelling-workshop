Oranssi Pazuzu is a Finnish psychedelic black metal band formed in 2007. The band consists of Juho "Jun-His" Vanhanen (vocals, guitar), Korjak (drums), Moit (guitar), Evil (keyboards, percussion) and Ontto (bass guitar). The band takes its name from "oranssi", the Finnish word for "orange" and Pazuzu, a wind demon from Babylonian mythology.

The band recorded their debut album, Muukalainen Puhuu in 2008 in Korjak's family cabin. It was released via Violent Journey Records in 2009 and followed in 2010 by a split LP with Candy Cane. Their second full-length album, Kosmonument, was released in 2011 through Spinefarm. In 2013, Svart issued the follow-up, Valonielu which was produced and engineered by London-based producer Jaime Gomez Arellano. The band's album Värähtelijä was released in 2016 and received positive reviews from music outlets such as AllMusic, Pitchfork and Spin. In 2017, the band released the two-track EP Kevät / Värimyrsky.

AllMusic's James Christopher Monger described the band's music as a combination of black metal, psychedelic rock, space rock, and progressive metal.

Two members of Oranssi Pazuzu have also paired with members from Dark Buddha Rising to form Atomikylä. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Oranssi+Pazuzu">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
