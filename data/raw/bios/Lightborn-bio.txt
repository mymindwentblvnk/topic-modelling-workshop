Lightborn has emerged from the Philly underground as one of hip hop's most talented and respected lyricists and producers. The debut album "Angel of Def" created waves in the underground that reached overseas and his poweful live perfomances filled with live turntablist cuts and spoken word breaks brought him recognition in a city that is tough on any one who claims to represent it. The original style of Lightborn has set him apart in a time where it seems half the world under 25 years of age clamis to be an mc. "The Psychology of Fire" the new album which features Wu Tang Clan's Killah Priest, Philadelphia Legend Maylay Sparks, and other loyal members of his Heliopolis crew, further set him apart from the commercialized, fashion oriented hip hop masses, while elevating his status and appeal as an ill original in The ART.
