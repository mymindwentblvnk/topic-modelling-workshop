Self-contained would be the best word to describe the producer/emcee known to the world as Rashid Hadee. This Chicago native has roots that extend all the way to Jackson, MS were he was once a student of Jackson State University. Since his college days Hadee has set up shop in his hometown and pretty much taken over. 

Rashid is internationally known as the go to guy when you desire hard hitting soulful beats reminiscent of raps golden era but with a modern day feel. Fellow producers such as 9th Wonder and veteran  Erick Sermon consider themselves fans of Rashid Hadee’s work. The adulation is very much welcomed by the beat smith being that he is a fan of their work as well. As a producer he has provided tracks for  Little Brother,  Manov War,  Longshot,  Mindstate,  Pugz Atoms,  Psalm One &  Thaione Davis. As an emcee his work includes a 12 inch of his single Surrender (Neblina Records), A Change Gon Come Mixtape (hosted by  Rapper Big Pooh), Serenade For The Moment-EP (w/ producer  Analogic), a solo album entitled Dedication (Neblina Records) and a host of features on various compilations and mixtapes. 

He has also shared production credit on projects with fellow Chi-town native Kanye West that highlighted songs he produced with features from Common and Hip Hop veteran Special Ed.
