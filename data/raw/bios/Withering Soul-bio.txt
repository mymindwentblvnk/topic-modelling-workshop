Withering Soul's much anticipated full length debut, No Closure, captures an intensity that will only grow with each successive listen. Featuring carefully crafted songs full of interesting changes and climactic phrasings, the band delivers a mature sound that is not normally acheived on a first release. Also, as an underlying blue print, the band draws on influences from some of the finest in Scandinavian black metal before venturing off and establishing their own style. Throughout the album, you will find sinister yet majestic clean vocal melodies, catchy rhythms, and a haunting vibe that would make for an amazing soundtrack to a classic horror novel. No Closure was co-produced and mixed by Chris Wisco (Novembers Doom, Michael Angelo Batio, Soil), and mastered at Sweden's The Cutting Room (Behemoth, Dimmu Borgir). Tracks also feature guest vocals by Melissa Ferlaak (formerly of Visions of Atlantis). For fans of Cradle of Filth, older Dimmu Borgir, Moonspell and Dissection.
