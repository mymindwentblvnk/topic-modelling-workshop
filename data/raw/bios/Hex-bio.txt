5) Chaotic hardcore five-piece hailing from Peterborough, UK. Having formed in 2008 and released several demos alongside a self-titled debut EP followed by a second EP entitled 'Left Hand Path', Hex have firmly established themselves as a top contender in the UK hardcore scene having already supported bands such as This Is Hell, Grave Maker, Outbreak, The Legacy, Gold Kids, etc. with crushingly dark riffs accompanied by harsh, aggressive vocals to complete a powerful and energetic performance.

Having released 'Left Hand Path' and first music video, for 'Leviathan', Sam Gollings left the band to concentrate on his education, to which Hex recruited ex-Shores bassit, Luke Porter, to fill his role, bringing with him passion, experience and a brand new fanbase. With this, Hex had a defined line-up and began to play shows to a wider audience and around the UK.

24th June 2010 saw Hex self-release their debut album, 'Be Cold, Be Dark, Be Damned', and second music video for their song 'Sore', created, released and promoted by Creative Junkie Media.
