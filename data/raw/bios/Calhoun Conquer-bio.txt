Briefly active during the late '80s, Switzerland's strangely named Calhoun Conquer performed progressive thrash that drew comparisons to Canadians Voivod and Germany's Mekong Delta, among others. Their debut 1987 EP, And Now You're Gone, 
found vocalist/guitarist Geri Christian Gerling and bassist Stefan Gerling backed by a drum machine, but 1989's full-length Lost in Oneself saw them fleshed out with sibling guitarists Christian and Bruce Muzik. Drummer Peter Haas was also brought on board for the purpose of live performances, but when Calhoun Conquer disintegrated a short time later, he moved on to work with, ironically, Mekong Delta and, surprisingly, Krokus, while the Muzik brothers resurfaced in Babylon Sad. ~ Ed Rivadavia, All Music Guide <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Calhoun+Conquer">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
