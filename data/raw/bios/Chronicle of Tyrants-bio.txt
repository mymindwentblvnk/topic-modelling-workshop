Current Line Up: Manuel Siewert (vox), Nils Werner (bass), Hendrik-Koop-Lampe (git), Michael Tybussek (git), Carsten Schumacher (dr) 

Northern Germany-based Chronicle Of Tyrants was founded in february 2002 by Marco Wolfanger (git, vox), Carsten Schumacher (dr) and Manuel Siewert (vox). 

In the course of time some songs were composed which were obviously inspired by Swedish Death Metal both the modern style and the past. After having released the first demo "Mental Decay" in October 2003 completely on their own, the following period CoT among others played with bands like Dismember, Disillusion, God Dethroned, Anata,  and several german underground-acts. Having written several new songs in the following months, they started the recordings for "Nemesis MMIV" in October 2004 which once again should be done quite on themselves. The current album contains eight recent and three past, partly new recorded songs taken from the demo and therewith tots up on a playing time of about 66 minutes. It offers diversified, melodical Swedish Death Metal that does not disown its influences but also puts forward independence.
At the end of 2005 they signed at German "Animate Records" Label.

on 27th August '07 they split up.

"Yes it's true. We decided to split up, because of too many reasons, which made it impossible for us to work longer as a band together.
We want to thank everybody who supported us in the past and also a big salute to the bands we've played with. Some concerts definitely were unforgetable.

But I won't stop making music. Together with Micha and Nils I founded a new band and if you liked the old stuff, you will definitely love the new stuff
