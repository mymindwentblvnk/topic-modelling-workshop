It started back in Jan. of 1990 in my garage in PICO RIVERA,CA with the Our first line up. (Vocals-Maury,Guitar-Burgie,Bass-Raul,Drums-Murtle) In Oct. of 1990 Rito joined the band on Drums and Murtle switched to Guitar. In 1992 we were ready to go in the studio to record our first demo. Which was a 5 song cassette. At the time we where playing a lot of Backyard Gigs all around L.A. In 1993 we went back into the studio to record our first 7” which was a 9 song E.P. (SMD s/t 7” 500 pressed -out of print) That we released our selves. Around the same time shows started to get harder to get. So we played a few clubs in HOLLYWOOD and I remember one night at the ANTI-CLUB the owners were so pissed off at us, that when the show was over as they were kicking us out they said “you will never play HOLLYWOOD again” But we didn’t give a shit. In 1994 our friend Mike moved up to the Bay Area. So we had a out of town contact. By the beginning of 1995 we started going up North and playing shows all over the Bay Area with his band OPPRESSED LOGIC We ended up meeting a lot of cool people which we are still in contact with today. In 1996 we went back in the studio to record our second 7” which was a 8 song E.P.

After our set my friend Jeff asked if we would be interested in putting out a full length on his label (SIX WEEKS RECORDS) So it took us 1 year and 4 months to come up with this MOTHERFUCKER! In Sept. of 2003 we went into the studio to record our second full length which was a 16 song CD (SMD “MOTHERFUCKER 666” CD on SIX WEEKS RECORDS) Released April of 2004 The line up on this recording was, (Vocals-Maury,Guitar and Bass-Burgie,Drums-Rito) In Oct. of 2004 we went on our first tour out of CALIFORNIA covering most of the Southwest.
