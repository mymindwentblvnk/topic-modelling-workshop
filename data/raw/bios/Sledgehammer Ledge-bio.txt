Sledgehammer Ledge was an excellent sleaze rock band that took a page out of W.A.S.P.'s early 80's playbook, minus the sometimes-corny attempts to infuriate and sicken the public. 
  Formed in Cleveland, Ohio as Legs Up, the band relocated to Los Angeles and renamed themselves Sledgehammer Ledge in 1994. The group consisted of Chris Childs (vocals), Jade (guitar), J.P. (bass) and Raychill Bitch (drums). Legs Up had demo taped several songs, but never landed the elusive recording contract that every band is searching for. 
  Only one Legs Up song would appear on the Sledgehammer Ledge self-titled album, as the band was moving into a heavier direction. Childs had a voice that rivalled the guttural scream of Blackie Lawless, which made the band sound like a cross between W.A.S.P. and Spread Eagle. Their debut is getting hard to find, but is well worth the effort.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sledgehammer+Ledge">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
