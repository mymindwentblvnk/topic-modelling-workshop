Orun is a Progressive Death Metal band formed in Genoa in the early 2012 by the bassist (Luca Giacobbe) and the former drummer of the band with two guitarists (Jacopo Zanchettin, and Andrea Russano) and a singer (Andrea Olivieri).
Then the drummer left the band, which spent a period of inactivity but they found a new one (the current one, Filippo Garlanda) in a short time.
During 2013' summer, Jacopo Zanchettin left the band and Matteo Zangrandi (lead and rhythm guitar) took his place, and became a full-time member of the band.
The band started to compose and heading some live shows, which led them to record the new EP (come out January 2014).

The Band is working on new material and the creation of an outstanding debut album!
