1. Narita was a heavy metal/progressive metal band from Copenaghen formed in 1988. During their career, they released three studio albums: Narita (1992), Changes (1994) and Life (1996).

2. There was also a short lived U.S. Heavy Metal band called Narita, previously known as "Mark Reale Project".
Narita was formed by guitarist Mark Reale after Riot disbanded in 1984, and released one demo in 1985 before Sandy Slavin convinced Reale that Riot still had enough of a following to justify a reunion. Reale took bassist Don Van Stavern into Riot with him, and the band has been going on since.
