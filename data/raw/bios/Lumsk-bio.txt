Lumsk is a band from Trondheim, Norway which was formed in 2002. It combines traditional or traditionally inspired elements from Norwegian folklore and poetry with progressive rock (latest works) and metal (earlier releases). The music has both male and female vocals with violin, guitars and drums. Their debut album "Åsmund Frægdegjevar"  was released in 2003. They released their second album "Troll" in 2005. The lyrics were written in cooperation with Birger Sivertsen and Kristin Sivertsen who are experts on norwegian folk history. After their final tour following their third release "Det Vilde Kor", Ketil and Siv Lena left the band due to family priorities, and has since then been replaced by Swedish musicians Håkan Lundkvist and Jenny Gustafsson, respectively. Shortly after this, it was decided that the main vocalist Stine Mari also parted with the band, in order to pursue a solo career. A new vocalist Annelise Ofstad Aar joined the band not long after. As of 2013 according to their facebook profile they are currently writing and recording new material, and a new album will hopefully be released either in 2013 or 2014.
