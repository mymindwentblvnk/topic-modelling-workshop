Chambercraft is a one-man, self recorded and produced music project from Northern Ireland. Chambercraft does not however, follow the stereotypical constraints of a "Darkthrone/Burzum clone" format and offers much more scope in terms of atmosphere and experimentation as well as a uniquely refreshing brand of cold and spiteful misanthropy. All music, instruments and artwork by Sam Best. Chambercraft began in 2003 with a rough demo recorded on a four-track, 2004 saw a follow-up demo, "Delirium" with a much more focused and original sound. Chambercraft is solely about evocative dark music and creating a lingering sense of brooding dispair and inner discontent for the listener. If you value politics, religion or T-shirts more than soul possessing musical darkness then you will find little here of interest. The new Chambercraft EP is now available through my own fledgling record label, “Panzer VI Prodcutions”.
