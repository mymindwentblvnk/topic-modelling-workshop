A malevolence was torn from the putrid womb of darkness in MMIX in Netherlands when Plaag asked Dagon to entwine their tenebrous visions and spawn the malicious entity of Gestalte.

The embodiment of Gestalte after a few transformations is as follows:
Plaag – the bearer of the six stringed horror
Dagon – the horn of the infinite void (Necrofeast, Black Art, Hekel, Zwartplaag)
Bergh – the tormentor of the baleful twines (Zwartplaag)
Mordehm – the rider of the malignant echoes
Misanthropist – the scourger of the forlorn spirits (Zwartplaag)

The lyrics of Gestalte deal with occultism, black arts, spirituality, philosophy, insane anger, dwelling, madness, depression, deep inner reflections and misanthropy.

Gestalte has given birth to one anonymous demo (CD-version available through Self Mutilation Services and the tape-version available through Heidens Hart) and gave birth to its first full-length album, Ashes Of The Soul, 1st of August.
