Crash and the Boys (now known as The Boys!! And Crash!!) are a punk rock band from Toronto, Canada. They are headed by singer and guitarist Lucas "Crash" Wilson, who is backed by bassist, Joel McMillian and 8-year old drummer, Trisha "Trasha" Ha. The group is known for their hardhitting, yet strangely short punk rock anthems, such as "We Hate You, Please Die" and "I Am So Sad, So Very Very Sad", and their ability to control pure sound without the use of instruments. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Crash+and+the+Boys">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
