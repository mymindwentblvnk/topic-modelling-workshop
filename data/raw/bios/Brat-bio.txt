Pronounced like the meat product, not the unruly child. This peculiar duo out of Madison, Wisconsin released one self-titled album in 2003 before splitting up. Playing a folk-punk style reminiscent of They Might Be Giants, Heavy Vegetable and Ed's Redeeming Qualities, multi-instrumentalist Eena Ballard (NoahJohn) and guitarist Freddy LaForce (Fun Rod, Freddy Faggot, Inflatable Grandpa) split vocal duties on tunes that ranged from disarmingly sweet to cheerfully vulgar.


The Jazz band:
Brat are a young quartette from the city Trondheim in Norway, consisting of Eirik Hegdal and Kjetil Møster on sax, Ole Morten Vågan on double bass and Ole Thomas Kolberg on drums. They had their debut during the Norwegian music festival called by:Larm in 2003.
They play a sort of 'spontanious groove-jazz' (in their own words), impro and set pieces.
In 2005 they released the album Please Don't Shoot. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Brat">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
