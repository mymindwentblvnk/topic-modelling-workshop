In June 1978 Anthony Meynell was a songwriter/guitarist with a fistful of sharp '60s inspired pop songs but no band to perform them with. SQUIRE were already an establihed local group performing mainly covers and consisting of Enzo Esposito (bass/vocals), Steve Baker(guitar), and Ross Di'Landa (drums). Meynell talked Esposito into letting him join the band and thus squeezed into Squire line up on lead guitar just in time for their prestigious support at the Guildford Civic Hall to those other local boys, The JAM. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Squire">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
