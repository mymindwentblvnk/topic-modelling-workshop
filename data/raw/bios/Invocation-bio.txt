There is more than artist with this name: 

1. Invocation is a project formed by guitarist Tom Still in early 2009 with drummer Alex Todd-Weller, bassist Robin Saunders, and vocalist Matt Duffy joining early 2011. Guitarist James Hewitt joined early 2012 after departure of their former guitarist, Jim Bailey.

Their sound is a blend of hard hitting rhythmic riffs accompanied by epic soundscapes and melodies. 
The goal is simply to create and share music they enjoy with others. 
Bringing with them the tech, progressive and melodic influences that have inspired them to do so.

With the release of their debut self-titled E.P in November 2011, Invocation have since performed at UK Tech-Fest and shared stages with the likes of Chimp Spanner, Aliases, Bury Tomorrow, Red Seas Fire, Heart of a Coward, The Algorithm, and Hacktivist. They are currently working on writing new material for their next release and playing as many shows as possible!
