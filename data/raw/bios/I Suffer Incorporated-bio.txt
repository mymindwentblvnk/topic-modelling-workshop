The I Suffer Incorporated project was born in spring 2004 from the collaboration between Alex and Napulesh, already running on the Roman metal stage, with Val, a singer coming from the emocore scene. 

Moved by the common desire to create powerful, aggressive and emotional music, they fused together their different styles and in the summer of that same year they recorded the full length "Bury me in silence" (in co-production with the new born B/2D Films) and shot their first video for the single hit "Vanity", which was to stay for 3 months on top of the Vitaminic UK hit list as the most downloaded Alternative heavy metal song in England. 

In 2005, after an intense live activity, member changes and the composition of new stuff, they finally came to the present line up completed by the add of Luca Fois (guitar) and Mick (drums). The wide fanbase grown in these 3 years is not going to be disappointed with the new album Chronicles Of Lost Purity, coming out soon, by the end of 2006, surely destined to set a new standard within the European metalcore scene. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/I+Suffer+Incorporated">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
