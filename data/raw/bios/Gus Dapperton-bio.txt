Gus Dapperton is an indie pop artist from Warwick, New York, United States.

Starting out as a hip-hop producer at the age of 13, Dapperton made the switch to his current sound after a serious hospitalisation and the failure of his laptop. 

Pairing infectious, nostalgia-laden tunes with high-concept filmclips, lauded for their high-concept cinematic execution, has proven to be a recipe for success. Blowing up through 2017, with two EPs dropped, and fans and the press alike taking notice, Dapperton's future looks bright.
