Dieterich Buxtehude (Dietrich, Diderich) (c. 1637–9 May 1707) was a German-Danish organist and a highly regarded composer of the Baroque period. His organ works comprise a central part of the standard organ repertoire and are frequently performed at recitals and church services. He wrote in a wide variety of vocal and instrumental idioms, and his style strongly influenced many composers, including Johann Sebastian Bach. Buxtehude, along with Heinrich Schütz, is considered today to be the most important German composer of the mid-Baroque. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dietrich+Buxtehude">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
