Cinnamon Chasers, solo project of Russ Davies, has strong musical roots and cites early pioneers like Giorgio Moroder, Vangelis, Jean-Micheal Jarre, and KLF as key influences and leading to modern talent such as Alan Braxe, Rex The Dog, Junior Boysâ€¦ 

Rather than create pretentious moody dance music Russ wants to create music that has an honest heart, and good intentions, and feels like a good friend. Cinnamon Chasers achieves this with a perfect blend of crisp electronics, Pop based song structure and melodies, and an Indie feel. 

Cinnamon Chasers have been gaining major notoriety this year with their tune and video Luv Deluxe, which just won the award at the 2010 SXSW Conference for Best Music Video. The video has been a major viral hit on the web with over a million views in the first two months of launch and is being screened on over 30 film festivals world wide. Sunset Drive is their eagerly anticipated follow-up release and is a perfect warm-up for the summer season with 5 sunshine soaked electro pop tunes all in the quirky unique style that CC have become so well known for.
