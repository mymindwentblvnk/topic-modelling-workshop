Goat Horns first official tape "FULLMOON WORSHIP" was released in 1999 by SAH. A deal was struck with APHELION PRODUCTIONS , which resulted in the release of an 8 track split cd with THE TRUE ENDLESS.
The demo tape was re-issued with different artwork on WITCHHAMMER PRODUCTIONS of Thailand. 3 tracks were submitted to WARLORD RECORDS to become "THE WITCHES' CURSE" 7" ep in 2001, but to date it has not been released.
Frantic recording activity , with help from EQUINOX, led to a 7" ep "THE NOCTURNAL CALL" , followed by "MAGICIAN OF BLACK CHAOS" cd , both issued by APHELION. The "MAGICIAN" cd received excellent reviews in the underground press, and more mainstream magazines including TERRORIZER, who issued a 9 out of 10 rating.

The cdr "FROM THE VERY DEPTHS OF HELL" was issued by SAH(EquimanSean) in very small quantities, and will be re-issued later this year as a full cd on APHELION. The track "THE TORMENT" was included on the "GOATWATCHERS UNITED PART2 " comp 7". A remixed and improved version of this will be included on a very limited vinyl GOAT HORNS compilation LP later this year, followed by the release of new material on cd and vinyl.
