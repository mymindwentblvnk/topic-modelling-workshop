Two crazy fire crotches from Vincennes, IN got together to make beautiful lyricless punk rock. They often play really crappy shows at Starbucks and churches, and ruin perfectly good songs by covering them and forgetting the lyrics. Some fan favorites include Pork & Beans, Hair, and Boys In Da Hood. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fire+Hazard">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
