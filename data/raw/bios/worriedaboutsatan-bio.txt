worriedaboutsatan is the electronica project of Gavin Miller. 

worriedaboutsatan (stylised as all one word, all lower case) began while Miller was a member of Johnny Poindexter.  After listening to some demos that Miller had been putting together at his house in late 2005, Thomas Ragsdale joined to make worriedaboutsatan a duo. Those demos went on to form worriedaboutsatan, aka 'EP1', which was a collection of Miller's demos and sketches. Together, their sound was initially a mixture of post rock and IDM, although their newer material is heavily influenced by minimal techno. 

The first official worriedaboutsatan release as a duo was 'An Infinity Of Oncoming Lights', a single that was released in late 2006. The title comes from a line in the Philip K. Dick novel 'A Scanner Darkly'. 'EP02' followed in 2007, and featured various re-workings of original tracks from the first EP and also some brand new material, including a collaboration with Leeds based singer/ songwriter Paul Marshall.

Their debut album 'Arrivals' was released in May 2009 and in the same year they released 'Arrivals Remixed', a two disc remix album, featuring re-workings of tracks off Arrivals, by the likes of Her Name is Calla, Golau Glau, Marco Zenker and many more.

The duo have also released music under the name Ghosting Season.

Ragsdale left worriedaboutsatan in 2019 to pursue a solo career.
