Dead Child is a metal band from Louisville, Kentucky. The band played its first show at Lisa's Oak Street Lounge on August 19, 2006, with Pusher, Lords and Blade of the Ripper.

The band is notable for its members, all of whom have been in prominent indie rock and underground bands:

    * David Pajo of Slint, Zwan, Tortoise, and numerous other projects
    * Todd Cook of The Shipping News, Crain, and the reunited Slint
    * Michael McMahan of The For Carnation and the reunited Slint
    * Tony Bailey of Lords, Crain and numerous other projects, who sadly died in late September 2009
    * Dahm of Phantom Family Halo and Brothers of Conquest

During the 2005 Slint reunion tour, Pajo, Cook and McMahan decided that they wanted to play a more aggressive style of music akin to early Metallica, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, and other metal bands that they admired as young people.[1]

The band has recorded an unreleased (as of August 2006) EP at | Headbanging Kill Your Mama Music in Louisville. They also performed their song "Never Bet the Devil Your Head" for the Burn to Shine DVD series
