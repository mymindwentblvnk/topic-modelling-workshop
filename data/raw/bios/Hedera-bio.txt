There are two artists under the name of Hedera:

1) Hedera is a multi-faceted artist based in Scotland that draws influence from genres such as neofolk, post-rock, black metal, shoe gaze and ambient. Musical stylings include clean and distorted guitars laden with effects, reverberant drums and baritone singing or wailing vocals. A debut EP, Retrospective, is due for release in autumn 2016.

2) Hedera was the working title for Andraste, the solo project of Rachel Iden (Speight). The project has now been completely moved over to the Andraste Last.fm page: http://www.last.fm/music/Andraste <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hedera">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
