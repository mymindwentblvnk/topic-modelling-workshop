Hailing from the most isolated city in the world, Perth, Western Australia, Befallen captures a powerfully abysmal dark energy, combining punishing speed and grooving rhythms with death/black metal undertones. Befallen evoke a unique sound, eluding the shallow confines of existing metal sub-genres.
