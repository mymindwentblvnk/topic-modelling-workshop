Blackened Thräsh from the Mighty West-Vlaanderen  (Belgium)
The beginning of the year 2001, four maniacs decided to start an old-school thrash band. Clitsucker (guitars), Vrondor (guitars), Peetn (drums) and PoserSlasher (vocals) started rehearsing. 

So they started with writing some songs. Two songs were written (´Execution of a christian´ and ´Peetn, the maniac´). But things didn’t really work out. So on a day Clitsucker was rehearsing with Hennix on drums to start an extreme black metal band. Instead of forming this band Hennix was asked to join Demonizer and so he did in june 2001. Now a bassplayer had to be found, so they asked Sammath to join ´em. After a while Sammath sang as well.
Demonizer was born!!!! 

So with the four of them they started to rehearse. The first two songs went great and they sounded a lot faster and tighter in the new line-up. The second song also changed into ´Human Disease´. They also added some black metal since it now was possible to play fast(er). 

A try-out gig on nov the 2th 2001 went better than hoped for… 

Due to a shouldercomplaint Sammath had to lay down his bass for a while and Demonizer searched for a bassplayer. Athanor was found and joined the band at the beginning of 2002. And so Demonizer became a band with five members!! 

Some gigs were played with bands as Houwitser, Enthroned, Occult, Double Diamond, Infernal Legion, Nargaroth, Aborted, Ancient, Panchrysia, Thus Defiled, Putrid Inbred and others.
