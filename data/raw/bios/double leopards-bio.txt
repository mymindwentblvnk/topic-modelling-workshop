Part of the Eclipse Records and Troubleman stables, and associated with Sunroof! and GHQ. Based in New York City, they formed in 1998 and played their final show at All Tomorrow's Parties in 2006.

Mike Bernstein & Maya Miller play with Nate from Mouthus as Religious Knives, Marcia Bassett continues to play solo as Zaïmph and with many collaborators, and Chris Gray plays in Endless Boogie.

"Double Leopards are a big name in the new noise underground, but most people probably haven't heard them — though not for lack of trying. Tracking down the NYC-based act's early, hyper-limited CDR, LP and cassette releases would take infinite patience, not to mention a well-funded PayPal account. Live shows are almost as elusive — occasional club dates with Sonic Youth sit alongside a slew of performances in people's living rooms, art hovels and deserted church basements. Double Leopards are often lumped in with extreme noise terrorists like Hototogisu (with whom they share bassist Marcia Bassett), Bastard Noise and Wolf Eyes. Rather than rupture eardrums, Double Leopards channel chasms of feedback and metaphysical drone into quasi-orchestral movements of light, sound and particle mass.Band will never earn an easy listening tag, but their muted take on extreme noise is slightly more accessible than the work of many of their contemporaries. Some might say that they've taken background noise to a whole new extreme, but it isn't noise for the sake of noise — it's a thoroughly mapped dissertation on the way the sounds around us shape our day-to-day lives."
