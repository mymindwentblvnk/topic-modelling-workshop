Rise of Malice was founded in December of 2009 by Satwe, Nørlåndær & Størfeth.A demo called Coronation of Liar was released in 200 copies in early 2010. Our second demo called "Rise of Malice", was released in 300 copies on tape by "War Productions" in February 2012. NecroAcherontas joined the band on drums in October 2011. Some new material is ready as well and we are planning to record our first full-length album in the next few months. The music style can be described as anti-religious black metal, in the vein of the cold, grim second wave of Norwegian black metal.
