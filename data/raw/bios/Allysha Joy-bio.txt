Singer, pianist, writer, poet and creative being, Allysha Joy, is a key member of Melbourne collective, 30/70. Their growing success over the last two years has led her to further challenge her expression in a project of her own. Whether performing solo on Fender Rhodes or accompanied by her band, Allysha’s steady groove, husky vocal tone and unique style of writing emanates her own personal truth and illuminates a powerful feminine energy learning to be peaceful, giving and considerate of others. 

Her debut LP ‘Acadie : Raw’ is set for release September 22nd with Manchester based label Gondwana Records.  Allysha can be found floating between Melbourne and the UK, in person or via either of her monthly mixes on Sky Lab, Melbourne or Reform Radio, Manchester.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Allysha+Joy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
