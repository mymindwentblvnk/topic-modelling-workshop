Fisthammer formed in winter of '08 . After months of rehearsing, they recorded their first three track demo with brothers Mike Sabolick and Doug Sabolick (A Life Once Lost.) After many national tours and line-up changes, Fisthammer as completed their debut full length with Carson Slovak of Atrium Audio which is to be released on Horror Pain Gore Death Productions this January 2012. Inspired by many genres of (but not limited to) metal, Fisthammer brings to the table a well-balanced breed of death metal.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fisthammer">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
