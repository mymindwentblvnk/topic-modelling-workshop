Zenithrash was formed by Håkan Lyckberg in the summer of 2004 in Japan. Since the band’s conception, he has been the sole member and plays all the instruments in his recordings. It was his ambition to create unique death metal inspired by feudal Japan, samurai, and the beautiful natural landscapes of Japan. Because of this, there is a fair amount of Japanese folk influences that show up throughout his music. Lyckberg often incorporates traditional instrumentation by utilizing the sounds of the shamisen, the koto, and the shakuhachi.
