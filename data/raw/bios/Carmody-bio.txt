There are multiple acts under the name Carmody:

1) An Italian synthpop / minimal synth band from Torino, Italy.
The line-up consisted of Andrea Lesmo (synthesisers, tapes, bass, guitar) and Alberto Ramella (vocals) with the some help from Massimiliano Casacci (guitar - nowadays in Subsonica and running the Casasonica Studios) at the later stage of their existence.
They recorded from 1981 to 1985 and issued three incredibly rare demo tapes. In 2009, a "Best Of" compilation CD titled "A Better Spider" was issued by German label Anna Logue Records. They were mates of Monuments and Chromagain, also following a similar musical path with predominant synthesisers and drum machines (Boss DR-55, Korg KPR-77, Roland TR-909) along with some sparse guitars here and there.

2)  An English singer-songwriter, best known for her work with Tom and Laura Misch. After the release of the Out of Sea EP with Tom Misch, she released her debut EP Skin. This was followed by Five Kinds of Loveless in 2018 and Catching Blue in 2019. Her fourth EP In Jupiter was released in 2020, with her fifth EP Constellations A being released in November 2021. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Carmody">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
