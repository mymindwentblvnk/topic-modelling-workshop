Female fronted heavy rock metal blended with symphonic/orchestral elements, acoustic guitars and violin driven melodies...

First line-up formed in 2007 and recorded "I can you hear you thinking..." demo cd which was released in January 2008. This was a mix of male/female lead vocals blending traditional heavy metal with violin, acoustic guitars and orchestral elements.

In 2009 the band went through a complete line-up change and redefined its music style to female fronted heavy/symphonic rock metal. They recorded "Sand on your hands" track featured in MNR  V4 CD compilation. 

March the 28th is the official release date of their debut full-length album entitled "Dreaming of your fears" (STF records). More info you can find at http://www.julian-lullaby.com
