Revulsed is death metal band that originated in Australia in 2010.

After the demise of the Christian doom metal band, Paramaecium and inExordium, Jayson Sherlock and Sheldon D'Costa formed Revulsed in 2010. The band wrote their debut album for five years with Justin "Yowie" Smith formerly of fellow Australian Christian death metal band, Metanoia, still in search for a vocalist. For a brief time, they had Peter Ball of Those Who Fear as their vocalist;[3] it was not a good fit and Ball left. He was replaced by Konstantin LÃ¼hring of Defeated Sanity and they finished recording their debut album.[4] <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Revulsed">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
