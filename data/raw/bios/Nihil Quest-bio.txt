Nihil Quest was established in the summer of 2006. The main idea was to play music inspired in first place by hard rock and metal classics (such as Black Sabbath, AC/DC, Slayer), but also to include some blues and industrial rock influences.

In late 2011 a full-length, 11-tracks record was released, entitled "1.1 Splendid Isolation". The album took a spectacular form of a pendrive resembling a severed human finger. Sporting a Nihil Quest tattoo, the finger was a nod to the video released earlier by the band, depicting German cannibal Armin Meiwes. 

Nihil Quest stands out from the local music scene because of their inclination for art and multimedia. So far, Nihil Quest has released three music videos and many other video pieces that use fragments of the band's music. Also worth mentioning is "Memento Mortyria", a short story written by the vocalist of Nihil Quest, Ian Giedrojc, published in the November 2011 issue of "Science Fiction, Fantasy i Horror" magazine. It has motifs connected to the track "Chemical Saviour", as well as some direct quotations from the lyrics.

Nihil Quest went through numerous lineup changes. The band currently consists of:

Ian Giedrojć - vocals
Jarosław Koźbiał  - drums
Bartek “Sowa” Kazimierski  - guitar
Tomek “Kliford” Kulig - bass <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nihil+Quest">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
