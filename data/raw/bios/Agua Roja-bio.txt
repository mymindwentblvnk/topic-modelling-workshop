Agua Roja: a French band with a Spanish name and English lyrics. Don't you feel more cultured already?

These three Parisians have been around for about a year, only five songs deep into a blossoming catalog of easy-listening tunes. The latest of these is "Joey," a new single that sounds like a free-flowing river of liquid heartache (in a good way).

Cut from the same silky cloth as bands like Real Estate and Beach House, you'll immediately fall into a satisfied daze from their airy instrumentals, but lead singer November's drifting melodies are what really accent their sound. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Agua+Roja">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
