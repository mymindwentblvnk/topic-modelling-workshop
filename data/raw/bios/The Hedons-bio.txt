Formed shortly after the dissolution of Indy doom giants NECROPHARMACON in the hot summer of 2010, THE HEDONS are an unapologetic hybrid of punk, fuzz, doom, and psychedelic rock. Composed of Jeff Kaleth on guitars and effects, Ryan Strawsma on bass and low-end, and Jace Epple on drums and percussion, this power trio blends an elegant dance of hypnotic and screechy exclamations with guitar and bass-driven melodies. Driven and inventive, this band is all about the release, in whatever shocking form of pleasure it may take.

The band’s first year has been spent on the development of their debut EP “Earth on my Nerves”, released digitally on Bandcamp in June of 2011.
