... Therefore, we ask all artists - please don’t block an official image for yourself only. In order to view the image maintain justice, it's necessary to keep things running free. …
Especially hot brother from blue oysters, which came here last and has the least votes from fans, let them realize that has behavior is embarrassing. 
The Czech band Kern exists since 1981: http://www.kern-remember.com/historie.htm. Their images and details placed on Last.fm before he (3 Jan 2007 vs 24 Jul 2008). And they also have more fans and positive responses (21/2 vs. 5/20)
Therefore required (now with good-hearted smile) - mate, don’t block an official image and behave like an honest man. Thank you.
