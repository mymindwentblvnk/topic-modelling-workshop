Abunai! were an American psychedelic space-rock band who were fond of adding traditional British and American folk elements to give an added dimension to their sound.  

Formed in Brighton, Massachusetts (a neighborhood of Boston) in 1996, they released three albums and two EPs for the Australian Camera Obscura label.  

Abunai! broke up in 2002, but not before playing at three of the Terrastock festivals. They reunited in 2006 for Terrastock 6 in Providence, Rhode Island, and in 2010 for Deep Heaven Now in Somerville, Massachusetts.

Live collaborations during Abunai!'s existence included those with Brother JT, Nick Saloman (of The Bevis Frond), Barbara Manning, Bobb Trimble, and Mark Dwinell (Nonloc, Bright).

Abunai!'s most up-to-date sites are www.facebook.com/Abunai.sound and their Bandcamp site. Their original homepage (www.abunai.com) is still updated occasionally.
