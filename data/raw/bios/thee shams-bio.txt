Thee Shams was a garage rock band from Cincinnati, Ohio, consisting of Zachary Gabbard, Andrew Gabbard, Joey Sebaali, Max Bender, and Keith Fox. They were signed to Mississippi's Fat Possum Records and also released records on Shake It Records and several other small labels. Many of Thee Sham's recordings were engineered by John Curley (of Afghan Whigs fame) at Ultrasuede Studios. The band played a large role in Cincinnati's garage rock scene until they broke up in 2006.

After Thee Shams broke up, the Gabbard brothers and Sebaali went on to form the Buffalo Killers, a band with a similar style but with greater emphasis on songwriting and less Southern rock influence. This new direction could be heard in Thee Shams' final album, Sign the Line. Buffalo Killers were quickly signed to Alive Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Thee+Shams">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
