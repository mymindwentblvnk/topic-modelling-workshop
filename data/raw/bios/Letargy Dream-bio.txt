Letargy Dream. One-man band from Moscow. Project was founded in 2003.
Early works are the mixture of different styles of music such as doom, gothic and darkwave. Generally it is gloomy music with rich atmosphere oriented on hard guitar sound. There are both instrumental compositions (albums "Breath Of Deceased", "Ambit Of Dreams (EP)") and compositions with clean male voice and also amazing screaming and growling. Album "Sleep In Peace…" ("Спи спокойно…") signed a new period in the history of the band. It was made in gothic metal style with inclusions of doom metal. Russian lyrics deserves special attention. On the album "Fragments Of Memory" ("Осколки памяти") the band took the direction to melodic doom/death.
The music became slower and really harder but didn't lose atmospheric sound of previous works. Vocals are the mixture of growling and declaiming clean voice.
