Adaestuo is an international band with members from Belgium, Poland, Finland and U.S.A that plays a mixture of raw black metal, experimental and dark ambient. Their first EP "Tacent Semitae" was released in 2016 and the first full-length album "Krew Za Krew" was out in 2018. Releasing their debut through the label World Terror Committee, Adaestuo was described as a band "formed as a covenant between three wandering souls at the unhallowed crossroads where the darkest elements of ambient, black metal, and spiritual praxis conjoin" and "being a series of audial sigils cast by VJS and P.E.Packain and led in evocation by Hekte Zaren".
