Endsmouth is quite a young band (02.2012), which plays music with the elements of Stoner, Doom and Psychedelic. The forces of two dark samurais from St. Petersburg and two hellbounds-oil producers, who came to the city of the Swamp from shiny Surgut, joined here.
They are responsible for " Back to the Swarm " (EP,2012), constant work on new material and live performances. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/endsmouth">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
