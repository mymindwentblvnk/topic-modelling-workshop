1.  Hailing from Detroit, Michigan, Jesus Wept self-released their (digital only) debut EP Crushing Apartheid in late-2017, unleashing their brand of sleaze-soaked Death Metal upon the industrial wasteland they call home.

Described as Carcass for the next generation, Jesus Wept’s sound harkens back to the Heartwork and Swansong-eras, while also channeling the spirit and attitude of ’80s L.A. Metal. 

2. Jesus Wept, christian hardcore from Pennsylvania. xDisciplex AD played their final show at the 2004 Facedown Fest. Not too long after that incredible show, all of the members of xDx arose with a new band. That band is Jesus Wept. Both the music and the message of Jesus Wept are straightforward and honest. With 9 years of experience playing together in xDx, you can be assured that Jesus Wept will continue where xDx left off and will create some hard hitting music and lyrics.
