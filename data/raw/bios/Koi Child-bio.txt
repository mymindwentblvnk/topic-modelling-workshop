Koi Child is a seven-piece hip-hop group based in Fremantle, Australia. Birthed in 2014 from the collaboration of two local bands, Kashikoi and Child’s Play, their electronic hip-hop and prog/jazz-rock fused to create something unique, establishing them as one of the most impressive emerging acts in Australia. A chance witness to the band’s first performance, Kevin Parker of Tame Impala offered the band a support slot and mixed their debut LP, recorded on a small island shack south of Perth.

The album’s thunderous second single ‘Black Panda’ has made waves, receiving high rotation on triple j and Apple Music’s Beats 1 with Ebro Darden, heavy US college radio play including KCRW, and has reached 2015’s most-played lists across Australian community radio. Online, the track received apt praise across notable sites such as Earmilk, The Fader and Noisey, whilst their first single ‘Slow One’ received big love from Zane Lowe on BBC Radio 1, who formally branded the group “Future Radio 1 Artists”. The band also featured in Spotify’s ‘Spotlight on 2016 Australia & New Zealand’, and won ‘Most Popular New Act’ at the 2015 WA Music Awards.

The unlikely hybrid has excelled in the live arena, selling out headline shows across Australia; supporting Tame Impala along their national tour and playing for Hiatus Kaiyote, Fat Freddy’s Drop and Young Fathers. After hitting festivals such as the esteemed Golden Plains and State Of The Art, they’re due for a huge summer including Laneway, Southbound and Strawberry Fields.

In March, the band released their self-titled debut LP via Pilerats Records / Warner Music Australia to great critical reception, as well as debuting on the ARIA charts at #6 in the Urban category and #25 overall. The album is now nominated for the 2016 Best Urban Album ARIA award.
