Québécois Black Metal, strongly inspired of Quebec's wide winter landscape. The music wants to be a dark musical interpretation of long evening winters. The gloomy and distressing mood mask a cold stormy black metal. The songs, which are not very comprehensible for the listener, have however the quality to be sung in French (native language). To which they are often drawn from renowned french Canadian poet, such as Emile Nélligan (cursed poet | 1879-1941). Neige et Noirceur translates to 'Snow and Darkness'. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Neige+et+Noirceur">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
