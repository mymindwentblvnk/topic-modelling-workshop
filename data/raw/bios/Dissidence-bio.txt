There are two bands called Dissidence.

_____________
(1)Dissidence was formed in 2007 in Worcester/Malvern, Midlands, UK. A lineup that in just a few short years had thirteen different members. About to unleash their second EP - entitled "Venus", they are currently working on expanding their horizons further into the West Midlands and the rest of the UK.

The debut EP, "Go Ahead, Let Your Children Burn", limited to a hundred copies, was released in the summer of 2008. At the end of 2009, they started to gig again, after some time away rehearsing with their latest drummer. Over the last few years gigging, they have gigged up and down the West Midlands, playing their own blend of thrash/hardcore metal with all sorts of other bands, from black metal to acoustic, punk and ska bands to hardcore and screamo bands. From their myspace page comes the following quote; 

"DISSIDENCE- METAL-HARDCORE FOR THE FREE THINKING. BORN IN A TIME WHEN MONEY IS GOD AND THE POWER OF THE INDIVIDUAL IS SLOWLY BEING STRIPPED AWAY, DISSIDENCE GIVES A MOUTHPIECE TO A GENERATION THAT WILL NOT LIE DOWN.

RISING FROM THE DEEPEST DARKEST DEPTHS OF WORCESTERSHIRE, DISSIDENCE OFFER A 6 WAY ASSAULT ON THE SENSES- FUSING CRUSHING GUITAR WORK, BRUTAL DRUM BATTERY & VISCERAL DUAL VOCAL ATTACK, DELIVERED IN A FRENETIC AND UNCOMPROMISING LIVE MACHINE. THE PAST 2.5 YEARS HAVE SEEN THAT MACHINE CONSTANTLY EVOLVE AND IMPROVE WITH A NUMBER OF BAND MEMBERS COMING AND GOING TO FORM THE CURRENT LINEUP.

"Dissidence have a unique energized blend of old school and new school punk rock with melodic, technical guitar playing, vocal harmonizing, and solid, fast-paced drumming." - Worcester Music Festival "

(2) Dissidence was created in July 1999 in Franklin, TN. But it wasn't until 2002 when their passion developed into something unique. They added the talents of a great drummer and excellent bass player then turned their sites on finding the right vocalist. After a 6 month national search, they found the right guy from Jacksonville, FL.

Their new 3 song demo, released on 12/12/2003, had 2 of their songs nominated as “track of the day” on Garageband.com and was featured on Radio Underground and KSCQ FM-92.9 weekly punk radio special "The Virus" in Silver City, New Mexico, while receiving top 10 honors on SuperNova.com, Broadjam.com and UpBeetMusic.com. The band held the # 1 most requested song on Musician's MP3.com, of all genres, for six straight weeks. American Dream Clothing in Jacksonville, FL recently announced their sponsorship of the band. A unique, energized blend of old school and new school punk rock with melodic, technical guitar playing, vocal harmonizing, and solid fast-paced drumming. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dissidence">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
