Carrion of Vigrid were a 5-piece Blackened Death Metal band from South Wales originally named carrion, knowing that many bands shared this name they decided a change was needed. The name Carrion Of Vigrid was taken from a Norse Mythology book, describing a battle on the plains of Vigrid between Thor and a serpent which ended the world. When asked what they sound like they simply relpy with "Dissection meets At the Gates with some current French Black Metal along for the ride?!"


They relased their debit EP in March 2007 via BH/BB records, containing three songs (two of which combine):

1. Beneath Both The Hexen Hammer and The Gaze Of The Blood Countess

2. Reaching For Empyrean: Ascension

3. Reaching For Empyrean: From Hell Fallen


They had toured around the country with other local bands, and were writing a mini-album expanding upon the styles and themes of the E.P due for release once again via BH/BB, however before the release of the second EP the band decided to disband.
