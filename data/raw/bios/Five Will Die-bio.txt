Established in Cork in February 2005, Five Will Die began life with its two founding members scanning the nether regions of time, space and schizophrenia for a musical landscape that felt right for their own personal and musical wellbeing. Three souls were drafted in with a similar vision, and a working band was formed.

Within a year, many energetic and sweaty gigs helped the band establish themselves on the local circuit as a band to be reckoned with. Two worthy souls came and went, contributing to a hectic gigging schedule before being replaced by an Ogre on vox, followed by a young alcoholic genius on bass.

A more expansive and intense gigging schedule followed helping this line-up form an incredibly tight bond. In November 2006, thoughts and songs were put to a 4 track demo, entitled “Year of the Dead”. The number of shows increased dramatically, as did the bands ambition. Successful tours of Poland & the UK helped the band develop into a serious live outfit.

Five Will Die continued with their hard working and gigging ethic right through to August 2008, when an ambitious 9-track effort entitled “Slung from a Tree” was recorded. Higher profile shows followed helping the band focus collectively and philosophically on a sound that is undeniably their own.
