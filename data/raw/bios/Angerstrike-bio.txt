Angerstrike originated in the small town of Salyersville, Ky(home of Larry Flynt). A few years ago close friends Brad(guitar), Rob(guitar) and Ashley(bass) joined together with a single purpose. It was to create music that represented the frustration they felt. However it became quite difficult to fill the remaining open positions in the band. Drummers came and went and finding a vocalists seemed impossible. Unable to attain a drummer and vocalist the three even tried filling the vacant slots themselves, but to no avail. Unable to perform live the band spent most of its time writing and recording songs with the aid of a drum machine. After writing several songs they continued the search for a drummer and vocalist. Again, many came and went. Then in the fall of 2003 they were joined by former Fildestrae guitarist Justin, on vocals, and Jarrod, also of Fildestrae, on drums. With the line-up complete the band was ready to bring its music to the masses. Heavily influenced by Meshuggah, Fear Factory, Machine Head, Morbid Angel, and Testament, their music is pure unrelenting aggression. Combining tight double-bass, harsh vocals and vicious down-tuned riffs the band is now ready to exorcise its demons and release them upon the world.
