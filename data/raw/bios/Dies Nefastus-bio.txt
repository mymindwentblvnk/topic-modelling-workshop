October the 10, 2002 - The very begining of DIES NEFASTUS.
In it's original line-up were:

Maxim 'Kejstevil' - keyboards, vocal;
Igor 'Senelder' - guitar, drums programming.


We only had the idea to make Darkthrone 'Cromlech' cover
at that time. Somewhat later 'A Black Bile' was recorded.
(That song had gone out in it's sense, yet was included in
'Visions of the World Aflamed' demo.)


March, 2004 - Bass-guitaress Katherine 'Satania' has joined the band.
She was accepted after the first rehearsal...


September,2004 - 'Visions of the World Aflamed' was recorded and published
by our own efforts.


December, 2004 - Demo released on tape by Swedish Deathkrush productions label.


February, 2005 - A new member N was found to become the bass-guitarist. –ê new song 'The Memories' was recorded by Senelder and Kejstevil.
