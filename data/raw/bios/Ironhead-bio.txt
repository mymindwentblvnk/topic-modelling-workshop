IRONHEAD is as snotty as The Dead Boys with looks that could kill even Motley Crue, while still being as hard and heavy as a punch in the face by Motorhead's "Iron Fist". This ROCK N ROLL band is bridging the gap between punk, glam, metal and even goth. If you can't find what you are looking for here...you just ain't cool!

IRONHEAD's new album "SEX BLOOD ROCK DEATH" coming soon in 2007!!! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ironhead">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
