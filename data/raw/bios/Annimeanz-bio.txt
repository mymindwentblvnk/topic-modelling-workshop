The road to being a rap star hasn’t been easy for Anthony “Annimeanz” Sarmiento but being raised on the tough streets of Cudahy, CA has given the half Mexican and half American Indian rapper the resolve to succeed. As a young man, Annimeanz grew up living from motel to motel as his mother struggled by herself to keep her family afloat. The gang and street life came calling as he looked for ways to fill his pockets with much needed cash to help his family survive through their hardships. Unfortunately, this led to time behind bars and it was here that Annimeanz discovered that he had talent for rapping. Rap had always been in his blood as a fan listening to the greats from the East and West Coast but with the help and encouragement from a family member, Annimeanz began to learn the craft of being an MC. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Annimeanz">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
