Anthrophagus was formed in November 2007 by Glenn (Guitars) and Maxime (Drums).

After writing about 2 songs, they liked the way things were going. So they had the thought of adding some bass. Gregory was invited to a rehearsal, and was able to fill in the bass-parts just nicely. And that's how Anthrophagus was born.

After writing and completing a set-list suitable for shows, they had a thought of adding some rythm guitars to make the songs and sound better and completer. So Wout (Galg & Vuurdood) was invited to a rehearsal, liked what they had, and became a part of the band as a rhythm guitarist.

On the 7th of February 2009 they recorded their first demo. It is a 3-track demo recorded and mixed by Kenneth Keysers. The Demo is called: Putrefaction Through Retribution.
