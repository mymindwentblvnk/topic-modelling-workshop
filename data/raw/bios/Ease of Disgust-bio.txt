Founded by guitarist Gennady Savin in February 2008, Ease of Disgust quickly found their signature sound and style as a deathcore band. After several line-up changes, the band was joined by former Dismantle bassist Ruben and Abominable Putridity bassist Andrew Disterov. A few months later, Ease of Disgust found a drummer, Anton Samohvalov. Soon, the band began playing live shows and recording their debut release. The line-up was finalized with the inclusion of guitarist Alexey Sazhin. In the summer of 2009, Ease of Disgust released their debut record, an EP entitled The Shell. Since then, the band has released one full-length album and one EP: 2010's Chaos and 2011's Exceeding the Verge, respectively.

Ease of Disgust have performed with death metal bands such as Suffocation, Suicide Silence, DevilDriver, Whitechapel, Misery Signals, Carnifex, Suffokate and Ion Dissonance, as well as various others both international and local.
