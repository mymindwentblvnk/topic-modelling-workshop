Powerful riffs with creative rhythms create an intertwining of battle hymns which mingle to form the soundtrack of life, death and rebirth; Autumn Eternal is the group of composers constantly molding each note towards perfection. Autumn Eternal nurtures music, if one is to hear an Autumn Eternal song today it may be totally different in a year after the constant progression and perfecting of each component. Each member offers his own element to paint a large picture of intensity, melody, emotion, and creativity.
