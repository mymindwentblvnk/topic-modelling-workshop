There is more than one band named Cybotron:

1) A pioneering American electro band (1980-1995). They consisted of Juan Atkins,  Rick Davis (aka 3070) and John Housely (aka Jon5). After a series of influential independent singles, they released the album Enter in 1983. Atkins split from Davis after the debut album and recorded as Model 500, while Davis continued to record under the Cybotron name.

2) The earliest Cybotron was an Australian electronic progressive rock band (1975-1980). They consisted of keyboard players Steve Maxwell von Braund and Geoff Green along with drummer Colin Butcher. They released four albums, starting with a self-titled release in 1976, and finishing with Implosion in 1980.

3) Cybotron is one of many aliases of the Drum & Bass producer/dj Dillinja. Only one album (2001) has been produced under this guise; Dillinja presents: Cybotron, which was supposed to represent a change of style from the usual jazzy production work of Dillinja tracks and other members of the Reprazent crew, such as Roni Size and DJ Krust, in favour of a harsher, jump up sound. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cybotron">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
