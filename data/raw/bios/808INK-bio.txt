808INK formed when producer/rapper 808Charmer, whose drumming talents have also seen him share the stage with acts such as M.I.A., Chiddy Bang and Tinie Tempah, spotted Mumblez Black Ink rapping over a hiphop instrumental on a video shoot. Since then, their collaborations have organically grown from a bedroom project to a multi-instrumental and visual collective with the inclusion of creative director Black Anubi$, who merged his previous artistic experience focused around the female form and the expression of sexuality with 808INK via glitch art.

808INK are what Londonâ€™s underground hiphop scene was lacking of, a creative collective able to destroy and reconstruct the conventions of any ordinary hiphop album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/808INK">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
