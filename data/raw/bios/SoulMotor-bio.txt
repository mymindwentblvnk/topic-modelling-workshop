This band was formed by Tesla bass player Brian Wheat back when Tesla was on hiatus. They have released two albums thus far ("Soulmotor" in 1999 and "Revolution Wheel" in 2002), as well as having two minor radio hits in "Guardian Angel" and "Omega Son". Their first single, "Guardian Angel", also had a music video that got a small amount of airplay on the short lived MTV X channel in the early 2000's. The band broke up after the "Revolution Wheel" touring cycle, but has since gotten back together as of 2010 and plan to release a third album in 2012 called "Wrong Place At The Right Time!".
