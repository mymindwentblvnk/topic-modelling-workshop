Gold Connections is Charlottesville-based musician Will Marsh, a new Fat Possum signee with a self-titled EP out in march 2017. The record was actually recorded back in 2014 when Marsh was an undergrad at William & Mary, with help from Marshâ€™s classmate: Car Seat Headrest mastermind Will Toledo, who produced, engineered, and mixed it in addition to contributing drums, electric guitar, bass, and backing vocals. Marsh briefly played guitar in Car Seat Headrest, and Toledo spent time drumming for Gold Connections. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gold+Connections">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
