In Vein was formed in 2002. In 2008 the band members are Christer Eriksen, Tom Kalstad and Jarle Hansen.

In January 2008 In Vein released their debut album "Strangled Voices" on Codeline Records.

With all the ingredients needed for a huge success, this band hits the pop music world with a set of songs that can act very well as a banner for the synthpop scene, bringing the genre much deserved attention. The danceable beats, melodic vocals, and catchy hooks seem to come easily for In Vein, and will doubtlessly be their formula for a bright future in music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/In+Vein">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
