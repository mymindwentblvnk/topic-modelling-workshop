Hailing from the mists of Wolvengard...a group of creative souls have emerged to take the world by storm... Fusing the old and the new to form a powerful sound, and fiercely dedicated to creating raw, energetic original material to keep your eardrums bleeding! 
 
Three early tracks are  available on Last.fm as free downloads

Their debut EP "The Beckoning Darkness" was released in October 2008. Two new tracks (with full length previews) have been added to last.fm: first Wasteland, a crushing epic set in war-torn Africa. Then the title track The Beckoning Darkness, as for the deep significance of this track, the more you listen the more you'll discover, see what it means to you...  The CD is available at http://cdbaby.com/cd/wolvengard and sneak peaks of some other new tracks can be found at www.myspace.com/wolvengard

Wolvengard is currently in what can only be called cold Canadian cryostasis, but various members and side projects will be added as they appear! 

Thanks for all of your support!
