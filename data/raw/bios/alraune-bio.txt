"Alraune have emerged under a dreary, murky occult veil. Hateful, sinister and sometimes melancholy in a furious passion… all while played with a ferocity and conviction that is typically lost in what passes for 'Black Metal' these days. Screeches like owls hunting prey…music played like cruel trick on the senses by an unforgiving mistress. The vile venom spit from the mouth of Alraune poisons the listeners thoughts and inflicts a sense of discomfort before the attack that ultimately leads to its victims quietus."

~Mike Meacham
