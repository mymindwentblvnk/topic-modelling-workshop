The band started working that is playing last year 2008 in December. Created just for fun at the time, but it soon grew to a serious band who are now searching for gigs and a label perhaps.

The bands first gig was in a club called Rockhouse which is positioned in a small town Å ibenik. The band began playing cover songs of Cannibal Corpse, Dying Fetus, Behemoth ... .

After that gig, some ideas began to pop out of their heads and the result is the PROMO/ DEMO named Forged In Hatred. It includes three songs: Slaughter Divine, Precise Annihilation and Bringer Of Cognition.

Now, the band is looking for gigs to promote them selves and to have a fucking good time.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Serpentslain">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
