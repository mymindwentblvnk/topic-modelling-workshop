Erupting viciously forward to kill and maim, from Gamleby, Sweden, Ribspreader is a death metal band started by Roger "Rogga" Johansson. Ribspreader's grasp of death metal is all that is filthy, extreme, gory and hateful to the fullest without the music losing vicious catchiness and outstanding quality.  Their lyrical themes revolve around death, blood, gore and anti-christianity exclusively. The band came to it's existence shortly after Rogga had finished his job with vocals on the Edge of Sanity "Crimson II" album. Rogga asked Dan Swan√∂ to join the band on drums and lead guitar. Andreas Carlsson joined as another lead guitarist, and Ribspreader was started. 

The band then quickly released their debut album "Bolted To The Cross", which payed homage to filthy old school death metal. The band's line-up would then soon change completely, as they would release their second offering, "Congregating the Sick". Rogga gathered his comrades in arms from his other band Paganizer for this second release, but then the band unfortunately split up due to lack of interest. Ribspreader stayed in the mortuary for nearly two years, before Rogga established the band again. Now Ribspreader is coming back in 2007 with a new album and live gigs. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ribspreader">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
