Defrost is a solo project based in Northern Germany.
It evolved from several other, stylistically quite diverse solo & band projects taking place from 1985 to 1998.
In February 1999, Defrost was born during an encounter with frozen bottles of beer in Norway, and has since released two home-made CD-R albums in 2000 and 2003.
