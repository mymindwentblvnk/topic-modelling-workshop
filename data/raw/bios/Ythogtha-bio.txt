Ythogtha is an Arizona black metal project.  The group has one release and is rumored to return to earth to drop their next album sometime in 2009.  Using the forces extracted from the void, the two members create a dark and noisy mix of black metal and down tempo doom.  Their first release, "False Faith", even includes a cover and tribute to California hardcore band "Black Flag." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ythogtha">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
