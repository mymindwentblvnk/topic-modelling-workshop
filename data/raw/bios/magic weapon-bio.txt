Jordan Robson Cramer played in a smattering of bands as a teenager in Victoria, BC, Canada before graduating from high school and shipping out to Montreal. Once in la belle province, Robson Cramer continued making music; joining Sunset Rubdown in 2006.  He has also performed with Miracle Fortress when Graham Van Pelt plays live.

Magic Weapon started as Robson Cramer with Mathieu Malouf, but a recent incarnation has featured the JRC on keys/ vocals with Matt Shane (also of Think About Life) on drums. Rory Seydal of Shapes and Sizes has contributed some guitar here and there. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Magic+Weapon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
