In Fall 2013, Katy Morley stepped into a machine with a box of old instruments and a pair of borrowed headphones. In Spring 2015, Morly came out. Subsisting mostly on native Minnesotan vegetation and a deep wintery sadness, she abandoned academia and a sensible career in neuroscience to follow an irrespressible drive to fuse emotion with sound.

In Defense of My Muse is the first collection of recordings made from this odd union of girl and machine - a curious collision of foreign technology and naive intuition. The four tracks on Morlyâ€™s debut EP are lo-fi explorations into the transient space between joy and melancholy, major and minor, rhythm and flow.
