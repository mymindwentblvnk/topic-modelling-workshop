Àbáse means cooperation in Yoruba. It is both the stage name of Hungarian producer and multi-instrumentalist Szabolcs Bognár and that of his six-piece band. Born in Hungary in 1991, he began studying jazz piano at the Budapest Conservatory. He experiments with Rhodes sounds, works as a DJ and dives deep into the highlife and Yoruba culture of West Africa. After organizing the Fela Kuti festival "Felabration" in Budapest in 2017, Szabolcs, known as Szabi, ended up in South America by accident. His mission: “Showcase the deep beauty of African heritage in Brazil! And combine them with contemporary elements”.

He takes drum lessons, performs during the carnival. And he records local artists in Rio de Janeiro and Salvador for months. Szabi puts the results together in Budapest. Berlin, where he has lived since 2018, also plays a role here. "Laroye" is a light-footed and danceable debut, mellow yet euphoric, a sun-kissed mixtape full of samba, retro hip-hop, afrobeat and even baile funk and R&B at times. Szabi had in mind: "a record that never leaves a DJ's bag" - the eclectic album will be released in November. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/%C3%80b%C3%A1se">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
