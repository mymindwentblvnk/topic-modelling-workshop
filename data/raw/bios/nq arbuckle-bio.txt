"The Last Supper in a Cheap Town totally drop kicks country out the window, putting a delicious spin on it so it travels even further. Guilty of having spied too curiously into a tender heart, NQ sings its secrets. With a rumbling voice that could send off an army and a heart like homemade cherry pie, he feeds the very hungriest of souls. Only an artist like NQ can fly a kite on a windless day and make arson sound romantic. When you’re listening to The Last Supper in a Cheap Town, life’s little details become divine. Suddenly food tastes better, one beer lasts forever and your apartment practically doubles in size. With some of Canada’s finest musicians in tow, NQ wins his fans for the second time with addictive lyrics, wicked arrangements and flawless timing. If you care to turn the globe a different way, you’ll find the sun rises over The Last Supper in a Cheap Town. Blue Rodeo, Chantal Kreviazuk, Ashley MacIsaac, Dodge Fiasco, Veal, Sarah Slean, Richard Buckner, Carolyn Mark, The Sadies, Hawksley Workman, and Rufus Wainright have all endorsed NQ’s artistry by granting him coveted support slots on their huge rock shows. Building an audience through this impressive touring track record, there is much anticipation for the release of The Last Supper in a Cheap Town, NQ Arbuckle’s sophomore album, produced by Luke Doucet."
