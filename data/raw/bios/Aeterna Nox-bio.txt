Aeterna Nox is an Italian heavy-thrash-death metal band formed in Nettuno, a little city near Rome in 2008. In fact, the first core formed in the august of 2008, composed by Fernando (drummer) and Michele (voice), who, after some searches, found the guitarist, Alessandro, and the bassist, Giuseppe. After a short time the bassist Giuseppe decided to go away because of different ideas which caused misunderstanding and disputes. However the band went on practising in a little hall in Nettuno, although the equipment and the locality for their growth were missing. Some time later the empty place left by the bassist was filled up with a new member, Mauro, who suddenly became part of Aeterna Nox. The band changed – hall, and moved in the “circolo arci” in Aprilia. Here was born their first song, Black Rose, and even if the instrumentation is more adequate the song is not so engaging because of the haste. Afterwards the first tuning the band was going to product another one, this time bound to a huge audience. But the disputes marked the awful moment and ended when Mauro left the band. So, at one week time before the recording of the new song, the Aeterna Nox were without bassist. But the will to go on pushed them and in some few hours they welcomed Valerio, called “Satan”. In only two days the new member learned the song, performing it on the bass and on the keyboard, and the band could finally record their second song, For the eternal life, song full of experience and will, characterised by a clear and charming sound. Now the Aeterna Nox have found their balance: the next tune is probably dated quite soon.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Aeterna+Nox">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
