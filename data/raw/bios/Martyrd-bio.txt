Martyrd represents the best aspects of the resurgence of classic thrash metal. Hailing from Queens, New York, the band mixes the head-banging elements of Testament, Megadeth, and Exodus with some of the melodic flavorings of Judas Priest and Iron Maiden. They have recently been seen playing with acts such as Sonata Arctica, the Misfits, Testament, Overkill and Yngwie Malmsteen, wowing the crowds each and every time. They are releasing their debut album "Maniac" in early 2009.

"Maniac is a heavy metal album that will fit as well in 1985 as it will in 2008. Many people describe us as thrash band, really we're a metal band with a lot of influences, you'll hear a lot of Megadeth and Exodus in us, as well as more classic Maiden and Judas Priest. We like to keep things fast and heavy, but at the same time harmony and melody are very important. We haven't forsaken everything that is new, but we've definately tried to hold true to what classic metal really is. Our album can hold its own against any of the metal classics, and will blow any of this new metal stuff right out of the water." 
-Mike, lead guitar and founding member of Martyrd.

MANIAC will unleash a thrash metal attack that captures what MATYRD's growing fan base have loved and admired. The title track can be described as a slightly schizo ride through the head of a madman forced on antipsychotic drugs, the track "Betrayal" displays the band's technical wizardry, for the ladies here is the ballad "Six", and of course fast and heavy neck-breakers like "Blue and Black" and "Soldier of Fortune."
