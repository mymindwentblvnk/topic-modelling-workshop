Pounding drums, blazing guitars and breathtaking vocals. Both clean and pure as well as distorted and perverted. Sin7sinS is a female fronted metal band from the Netherlands that distinguishes itself with its unique sound. 

The band was founded under the banner of a project. A project that at the end of 2007 grew to maturity by finding the musicians it missed. Sin7sinS became a real band and recorded a demo. A demo which brought them immediate attention and led to a number of great live shows, starting off at the famous Paradiso in Amsterdam. In 2008 the band toured Holland as part of the Dutch Jägermeister Tour line-up. In 2010 Sin7sinS recorded their first full-lenght album named "Perversion Ltd.". September of 2010 Sin7sinS signed a record deal with Massacre Records. The album was released worldwide on October 29 of 2010 and was very well received by the international press. 

Over the past few years Sin7sinS has played a number of awesome shows and left their footprint in the female fronted metal scene. Well-known for continuously renewing their sound and stage performance. In the summer of 2011 Sin7sinS decided to take things up a notch and convince fans around the world of their music. They took a six month pause for the writing of new material and to prepare new recordings.

The second album is named “Carnival of No Tomorrow” and was recorded at the end of 2011. The album was mixed and produced by Swedish metal-legend Dan Swanö. Dan Swanö himself and Mark Jansen (Epica/MaYaN) contributed with a guest vocal appearance on the album. The album will be released on May 11 of 2012 and will also be available for download.
