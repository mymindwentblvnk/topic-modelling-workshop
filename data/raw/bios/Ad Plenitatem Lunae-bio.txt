Ad Plenitatem Lunae project was born in Friuli‭ – ‬Italy‭ – ‬in A.D.‭ ‬2005‭ ‬by the will of the founding members Ermes Buttolo,‭ ‬Maria Valentinuzzi,‭ ‬Giorgio Londero and Alberto Revelant to create a band that mixes the powerful sounds of Heavy Metal with the melodies of medieval and folkloristic music, like bands as In Extremo,‭ ‬Subway to Sally,‭ ‬Finntroll and Turisas have done, but with a close eye on language, history and culture from Friuli Venezia Giulia.‭ After a long period in A.D.‭ ‬2009‭ ‬the line up has come to the current formation:‭ ‬Nakia Spizzo,‭ ‬that has replaced Giorgio as the lead singer,‭ ‬Giulio Martinelli and Marco Cargnelutti had joined the band.‭ ‬In the end of‭ ‬2009‭ ‬after the preparation of a good repertory of covers, the band has started to write new original songs with lyrics in the Friuli's language: Friulano.‭ The first demo‭ ‬CD has been produced by the band in May‭ ‬2010‭ ‬containing their first three songs:‭ “‬Sante‭ ‬Agnês‭”‬,‭ “‬La Cjace‭” ‬and‭ “‬Strie‭”‬.‭ Right now t‬he band is continuing to write new songs with lyrics in Friulano and is planning the live activity for the next future. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ad+Plenitatem+Lunae">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
