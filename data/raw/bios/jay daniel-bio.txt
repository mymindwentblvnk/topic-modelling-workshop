Jay Daniel, a Washington DC native was born in 1990 and moved to Detroit at the age of two. He began as a percussionist playing drums at the age of three. Since his youth, Jay has been deep into exploring music, from go-go to hiphop to jazz, and house; in high school he was the drummer for his school’s gospel choir.

Jay formed an interest in DJ’ing when he was 11 years old, after listening to DJ’s on radio stations such as WJLB. Jay’s mother, singer/songwriter Naomi Daniel, is the voice behind Planet-E classics’ “Stars” and “Feel the Fire,” both of which were produced by Carl Craig & released in the early 90′s.

In 2009 Jay met Kyle Hall through mutual friends, the two have been frequent collaborators ever since. Together Jay and Kyle make up “Fundamentals”, a monthly party where the two showcase their skills at MotorCity Wine at home in Detroit. Jay is a young DJ on the rise and will, undoubtedly be a name that will be heard often in the years to come. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jay+Daniel">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
