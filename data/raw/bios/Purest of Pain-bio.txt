2011 has been a good year for this young band that was formed in 2008 by composer and guitarist Merel Bechtold. This year brought them many shows, with national and international acts like Unearth, Torture Squad, Onslaught and Evergreen Terrace. With their blasting live shows they won several band contests and were nominated for 3VOOR12 Award Best Live Act Utrecht. In June they released their debut EP ‘Revelations in Obscurity’, this also received very positive reviews and they are currently working on new material.
They kicked off the promising new year sharing the stage with MaYaN, which was again a great success amongst critics and supporters.
