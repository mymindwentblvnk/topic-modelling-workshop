CHAOSSWORN was formed when the earlier version of the band, Cryptic Death (2004-2009), decided it was time for a change. With a new, more fitting, name Anton Johansson, Janne Posti and the brothers Andreas and Niklas Pelli set out to record their musical vision: death metal with tints of black, strong hooks and total passion.

"Chalice of Black Flames", their three-tack debut EP, was released in June 2010 by Abyss Records, and has received great feedback from all over the world.

In early 2011, Niklas moved to Stockholm, and Joni Salo took over the drumming duties. A full-length is ready and composed, and should see the light of day in later 2011.
