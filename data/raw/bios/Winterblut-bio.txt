From "Promo 2000" on Winterblut completely changed style from traditionaly German Black Metal to a more dissonant, disharmonic form of experimental Black Metal. The lyrical themes at that time also changed from traditional Black Metal themes such as Anti-Christianity, Misanthropy, Black Magic, Nature etc. to much more depressive and suicidal topics.

Winterblut is often mistaken for an NSBM band due to the release of the first album ``Der 6. Danach`` on the infamous ``Darker Than Black``-label of the Mï¿½bus brothers (Absurd (Ger)). Contrary to these rumours L'hiver/Winterblut has openly distanced himself from national socialist ideology.

L'hiver runs a studio in which besides Winterblut Black Metal bands such as Nargaroth, Nyktalgia and Krieg recorded albums.

Two new albums should be released in 2007:
Leichenstandard (recorded in 2000)
Das Aas aller Dinge (recorded in 2006) <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Winterblut">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
