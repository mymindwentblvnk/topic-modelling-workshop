Grindcore / Mince-core band called "Brain Corruption" is a band from Germany formed in September 2009. They play fast Grindcore with a strong emphasis on Blasts and D-Beats, so, they have also little influences of crustcore, d-beat and punk.. The lyrics are focused on social issues, politics and feelings. Their sound is not at all "low fi", in opposite, they have an excellent high technical level and their debut EP was recorded with a very good conditions. More information can be found here:
