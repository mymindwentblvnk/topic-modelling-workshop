Laurie Spiegel (1945), a lute and banjo player by training, is a Chicago-born and New York-based composer of computer music who reacted to the futurism and dadaism of the early pioneers by developing an original aesthetic borrowed from folk music, creating relatively atmospheric and melodic music via arcane mathematical algorithms.
Kepler's Harmony of the Worlds, Spiegel's realization of Johannes Kepler's book "Harmonices Mundi" was chosen for the opening track on the "Sounds of Earth" section of the golden record placed on board the Voyager spacecraft in 1977. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Laurie+Spiegel">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
