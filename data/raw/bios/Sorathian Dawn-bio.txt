For those who wish to stare into the devouring void, to hear the heavens crack asunder and taste the blood of dying angels; Sorathian Dawn’s malevolent aesthetic of darkness incarnate and satanic litanies throw open the gates of perception to delve into the black pallid depths of chaos. In MMXII Sorathian Dawn invoked a sonic manifestation of adversarial paradigms to corrupt creation, extinguish all light and deepen the fall. Behold and tremble before its terrifying glory!

“Existence itself will be eclipsed by my shadow.”
Andrew D. Chumbley, The Prayer of the Design.
