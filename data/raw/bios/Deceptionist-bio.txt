BIO
Deceptionist starts in 2013 by Antonio Poletti on guitars, Claudio Testini on drums and Andrea Di Traglia on vocals. The 'Deceptionist creature' starts a mental journey between the industrial topic and everything that is extreme in the society around us, which are the elements that create a world where reality and imagination merge into something monstrous and absurd. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Deceptionist">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
