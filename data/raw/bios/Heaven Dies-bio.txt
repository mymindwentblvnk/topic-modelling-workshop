Heaven Dies is started in 2004 by Alex (git), Andy (voc), Jan (drums) and Stefan (git) to make own music instead of "just" listening. So the four start jamming at Jan's house for the time being without a bassplayer.
Without a clue they solely cover songs of other bands at first till they decide to write own stuff.
A bassplayer is found a few weeks later as Daniel, an old friend, joins the band.

First live experience is gathered performing at two private parties, a first show is played in december 2006 at the Fabrik Coesfeld when Heaven Dies share the stage with End of Days, Mort, Militia and Fearce.
A few weeks later Jan decides to lay down drumsticks in order to turn more attention to his study.
A cool and competent replacement is found quickly as Dirk Oetjen is recruited in the beginning of 2007.

Sound:
Heaven Dies sound very metal and raw, their music is always straight forward without frills but also contains some midtempo breakdowns and some Gothenburg-style melodies. 
Textually Andy most of the time lets the listener look into the abysses of the human soul but also social critical topics play an important part in his lyrics. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Heaven+Dies">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
