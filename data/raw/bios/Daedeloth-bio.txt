Two bands:
1. Doomsters from Chile who self-assertedly play "abstract Doom-metal". They draw their influences from My Dying Bride, Anathema and other death/doom and gothic/doom bands and can best be described as such. Slow Death/Doom with a lot of keyboards.

1999: 'Live Reh.' (Demo) 
2000: 'Promo tape 2000' (Promo) 
2001: 'Demo 20001' (Demo) 
2003: 'Thy Will Be Done' (Demo)

2. Black metal band from France
