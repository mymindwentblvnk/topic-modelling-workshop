Vokyl is a four-piece progressive metal band from Sofia, Bulgaria. We were formed in 2009 as friends sharing a common interest in thrash, death and melodic death metal music, strongly influenced by bands such as Slayer, Death, Gojira and later Opeth, Katatonia, Anathema etc. Since late 2010 the line-up consists of Yavor Vasilev (bass, vocals and lyrics), Nikola Ognyanov (guitar), Yavor Mechev (guitar) and Zdravko Petrov (drums). In 2011 we recorded our first 4-piece demo. Our debut full-length album, "Аз търся човек" was released in April 2014, followed by the single track "В прохладните вечери" in 2015 and the double single "Пропукване" in 2017. The lyrical themes of the band evolve around philosophical topics such as the nature of the human being, solitude and the relationship of the individual with nature, society and other individuals. Our second full-length record "Вторите седем" was released on November 15 2020.
