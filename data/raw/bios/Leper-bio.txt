There are multiple bands called Leper.

1) Leper is a Canadian anarchist ska-crust band on Creepcore Records who often cover topics such as the vagrant life, the KKK, and homelessness all in a unique style blending oppressively slow reggae grooves with apocalytpic, world's end visions and dark sonic brutality. Their myspace: www.myspace.com/lepercreepcore

Leper are a misanthropic and very radical anarcho-primitivist blackened crust band, featuring some members of Iskra.

2)  Leper is also an alternative/ industrial/goth band from Chicago, Illinois that has an eclectic approach to their song writing. An edgier Cure, a darker Pink Floyd with NIN style drums. No stranger to the goth scene Leper uses driving keys, brooding guitar and hauntingly melodic vocals to orchestrate a compelling sound combining elements of goth, Industrial, dance & rock while generally exuding the shadowy emotional spookiness that defines a goth band, Leperâ€™s influences and inspiration are drawn from many different sources creating a musical tapestry woven with the threads of despair, struggle and redemption.

Formed in 2000 by vocalist/guitarist Skot Shaw - the band has gone through many incarnations and its latest one has bassist ottO Jensen, Cecily Marx on keys and Count Chuckula (http://www.soultonecymbals.com/ArtistDetail.aspx?ArtistID=790) on drums.
