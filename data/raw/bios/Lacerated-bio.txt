LACERATED (formerly Beyond a Lie) are a 5-piece Experimental Hardcore/Death Metal group that formed in July 2009 in the heart of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. 

Drawing influences from diverse musical backgrounds, Lacerated bridge the ever-present gap between rhythm and melody that leave a style not easily compared.

On April 2nd, 2010, Lacerated entered Complex Studiosâ„¢ to record their debut demo "...On a Pale Horse" which was produced by Roman Koester (The Red Shore). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lacerated">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
