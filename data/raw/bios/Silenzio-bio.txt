After they splitted at the end of the last century, which was dedicated to eardrums pummeling in many indie-pop-noise-core-post-electro bands from Niort, our 4 musicians (Freddy T, Thomas P, Julien C, Yohann B) meet again during a soaked week-end of summer 2003 with their old and dusty instruments. Their desire to return to primary noise and feel acoustic vibrations live through their bodies is too strong... Since their last experiences, they have extended their musical sphere and have had hindsight with their influences. Their music shall be resolutely rock but modern, punchy but melodic ; a heavy rythm, the guitars in the stars. Yet they need a voice to slide on this high-sounding carpet. Cedric N fulfils this job a few months later and completes the band : SILENZIO is born. Ten or so gigs and an E.P. later, they are ready to enlarge their prospects and open themselves to the world, or in other terms : how to express a tribute to silence by making as much noise as possible... <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Silenzio">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
