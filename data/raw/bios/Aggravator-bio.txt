Aggravator formed in 2008 by Vocalist/Guitarist Derek Jones and Drummer Mike Cortes. Their songwriting skill and knack for speed turned many heads and had promoters booking them even as a two piece band. As time went on they caught the attention of bass playing Steve Gonsalves who was watching them from the crowd. After a talk with Derek and Mike, the two recruited Steve to play bass for them. In September of 2010 Aggravator acquired Jesse Lopez who took Aggravator to the next level with his lead guitar skills. That same month Steve left the band, however Aggravator wasn't without a bassist for long. Within a few days of Steve's departure Tristan Hernandez joined them on bass and the lineup was complete again. With this line up Aggravator has climbed the metal ranks very rapidly, getting many fans, press releases, and radio play. They recorded the Seven Swords demo in October of 2010 and hope to hit the studio to record their full length debut in mid to late 2011. Influenced by Slayer, Kreator, Metallica, Megadeth etc. Aggravator is capable and more than willing to be a metal force for the next generation of thrash fans.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Aggravator">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
