Emerging from the exotic Madeira Island in Portugal, Karnak Seti present themselves as a solid, modern and persevering metal act. Blistering, catchy and downright intense is what comes to mind when listening to Karnak Seti. With 10 years existence, several works edited, including the thriving debut album "Scars of your decay" of 2009, distributed worldwide by the British “Casket Music”. They released early 2012 their sophomore effort “In Harmonic Entropy” – “a tremendous release bulging with stunning musicianship, impressive song writing and intelligent creativity.”

The name, Karnak Seti, relates to the combination of two subjects: Ancient Egyptian History and Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence, topics that were a feature in the early days of the band. The band has been around since 2001 and has been regularly releasing music since then. The fan base has increased greatly ever since their debut album “Scars of your Decay”, recorded in 2008 and produced by Daniel Cardoso, giving the band the opportunity to be the opening act for Dark Tranquillity and Insomnium on their 2010 European Tour dates in Portugal, as well as SWR Metal Fest, sharing stage with bands like Kreator, Immolation, Aura Noir and many others.

Recorded in April 2011, “In Harmonic Entropy” took Karnak Seti standards to another level and no one can deny the bands ability to compose and deliver above average metal songs.  Leaping into a denser atmosphere filled with dark and chaotic scenarios but still with the innate melodies that Karnak Seti has always produced. Lyrics reaching deep into the complex aspects of human behaviour and psychosis, the concept is perfectly represented by the intricate artwork, courtesy of Ana Gomes, where the reality becomes highly distorted. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Karnak+Seti">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
