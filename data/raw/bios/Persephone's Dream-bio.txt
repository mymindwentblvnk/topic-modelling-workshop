Persephone’s Dream began as an idea late in the 1980’s; an idea for a prog-rock band fronted by a dynamic female singer. While not an entirely original concept, it was clearly something that was rare and was definitely something that was not to be found anywhere on the music radar of time. By late 1993 this idea had begun to actually take form as Rowen Poole and Chris Siegle began writing and recording music for what would become the first release from Persephone’s Dream, Evening Mirage, in 1997. It was not until the 1999 release, MoonSpell, that people from around the world began hearing of the band and its music. By 2001’s release, Opposition, the band had become well known in the prog, metal and goth communities and was appearing at a number of the well known musical festivals around at that time. The band and its intense stage and light show won fans over at every live performance. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Persephone%27s+Dream">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
