Hess Is More started out in 2003 as an electronic solo project by Danish musician Mikkel Hess. Through 5 albums, various tours and collaborations the project has developed into it's current form: A Transatlantic Music Ensemble. 
Earlier albums were crafted by fewer hands, where as the 2014 release "Myheadisaballroom / Whoneedsapalaceanyway" presents the full 7 piece ensemble recorded "live to tape".
