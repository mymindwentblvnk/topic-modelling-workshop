LEGION OF GOMORRA is a four-headed Death Metal Band located in the Ruhr-Area, Germany. Founded in 2006, they quickly started to write their own, sick material, obtaining massive attention by the local media. After several shows, they finally won a newcomer contest. The basis for forthcoming gigs was laid and so the band played lots of very successful concerts.

In the late 2007 the Band decided to record their first five track Demo CD called “Silence”. 2008 the release of their second demo CD was not possible due a lack of money. Despite these rejections the Band established itself a name, playing over 30 successful gigs within their region.

Entering stages with their heads up high, they are still able to face the problems of modern society: their lyrics deal with war, genocide and all their accompaniments, underlined by a mixture of hard guitar riffs, forcing bass drum parts and occational catchy melodies.

Today, LEGION OF GOMORRA are more powerful and aggressive than ever - Starting the year 2010 with more gigs, a tour in Poland and the release of their first full-length album! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Legion+of+Gomorra">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
