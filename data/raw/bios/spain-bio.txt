Spain was formed in Los Angeles in 1993 by Josh Haden (son to jazz legend Charlie Haden). The group released three albums: The Blue Moods of Spain, She Haunts My Dreams and I Believe. Spirituals – The Best of Spain is a collection of some of their most poignant songs (+ two never before released and three live versions). Their song "Spiritual" was covered by Johnny Cash on his 1996 Unchained album, and by Soulsavers on their 2007 release It's Not How Far You Fall, It's the Way You Land. 

In 2007, Haden released a solo album, but also reformed the band with new members Tom Gladders (guitar), Randy Kirk (keyboards, guitar), and Matt Mahal (drums). To commemorate Spain's first shows in over six years, the band performed The Blue Moods Of Spain live in its entirety at the 2007 Tanned Tin festival in Castellón, Spain. This was followed by several shows in the U.S. A new studio album, produced by Soulsavers' Rich Machin, is scheduled for release in 2009.

Josh Haden's triplet sisters were in the  90's violin power pop outfit That Dog. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Spain">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
