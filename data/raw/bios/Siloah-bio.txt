Siloah were a German progressive psych / folk band in the vein of Kalacakra, Langsyne and others “curiosities”. A collective hippie musical tribe largely inspired by mysticism, LSD and sexadelism. Their music features a heavy use of stoned vocals (in English), mantra like guitar parts, flute, “ethnic” percussions. Their first drugged item released in 1970 offers a dangerous and imaginative ocean of trippy, perpetual jammings. A bombastic psychedelic explosion in the mood of the best german prog folk releases. The atmospheres are beautifully “acoustic”, sometimes dreamy and ethereal but never away from krautrock “primitive” sound. One year later they release an other highly psychedelic item with now more emphasis on keyboards parts. Both records have been re-issued in CD in 1993 on the Lost pipedream label. Today their discography is available at “Garden of delight”. An achieved musical experience and a beautiful “acid” folk trip that can ravish fans of krautrock.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Siloah">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
