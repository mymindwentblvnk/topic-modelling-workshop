The gothic metal band Sin Deadly Sin rise from the ashes of the band Evenfall in 2009.

Roberta Staccuneddu (vocals) and Max Boi (keys) decided to form Sin Deadly Sin with the aim of raising their gothic and electronic wealth of experience to a new step and mix it up with new influences, creating their own musical style.

2010 Alessio Bergamo (bass), Zeljko Marinkovic (drums) and Mattia Mariotti (guitarist and arranger) join the band by bringing their musical influences and experiences.

Sin Deadly Sin’s defined but varied musical style is the result of different peculiarities of its members, which are mixed and enhanced in their songs.

On October 31st, 2011 the official videoclip of the single “Your Heaven” anticipates the release of the full length album “Fall from Heaven”, out on March the 12th, 2012 through Revalve Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sin+Deadly+Sin">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
