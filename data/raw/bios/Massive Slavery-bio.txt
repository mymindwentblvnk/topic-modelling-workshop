Born from a concept elaborated by Marc-André Barrette (ex-Paroxysm) and Joël St-Amant (Descend into Nothingness), Massive Slavery has officially started in the winter of 2009.

Having previously worked with Joel in Descend into Nothingness, Pierre-Alexandre Mercier (Decrepity) didn’t hesitate before joining the guys in Massive Slavery. Even if the band was still looking for a frontman, they begun to write and work on some material.

After a couple of months of research, they finally put the hand on Jonathan St-Pierre, who filled the frontman place in the newly formed quartet.

His addition to the band gives a new dynamic, and a boost of energy to push them to finalize the writing of their first album. Called "Global Enslavement", the musical assault was produced and realized by Yannick St-Amand (Despised Icon, Beneath the Massacre, Neuraxis) and the release date was set for the first quarter of 2010. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Massive+Slavery">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
