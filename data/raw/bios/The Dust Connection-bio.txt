The Dust Connection is a symphonic/progressive metal band from the Netherlands.

The Dust Connection was formed in 2003 by five enthusiastic experienced music lovers.

They recorded their self-produced demo-CD at their drummer Robert's recording studio in 2003.

The Dust Connection received positive international press reviews for this demo, resulting in invitations to play on the prestigious ProgPower Europe festival and to support top bands such as Evergrey and Mercenary on tour. The band even managed to get a full interview in Hollandâ€™s leading metal magazine Aardschok, a rare thing for an unsigned band with no album out yet.

The Dust Connection is busy recording its debut album at the moment. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Dust+Connection">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
