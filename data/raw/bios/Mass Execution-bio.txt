Two bands named so:

1. Band was founded in august of 2007 by Vova (lead guitarist) (Delvin, Crimson Spell) and Denis (drums) (Delvin, Crimson Spell, Silence Of Death) in Naberezhnye Chelny. Their style was something between grindcore and brutal death metal. Then on the place of bassist came Vova and quickly learned all musical stuff. But member desided to play without bass and Vova becomes second guitarist playing in downtune. Last member joined ti band was a vocalist Ilmir (Delvin, Crimson Spell) with interesting growl voice.
