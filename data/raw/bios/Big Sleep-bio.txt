Singer / Songwriter Stefan Schwerdtfeger spent his childhood in the U.S.A., and later moved to Germany, from where he began his lifetime project "BIG SLEEP".

"BIG SLEEP"'s debut album "Everything Falls Into Place" immediately became a surprising and great success in Greece, the single "Looking For A Girl With A Washing-Machine" is still played in rock radio and rock bars alike; the following cd "Moonlit Days" - recorded 1994 in the South-West of France - opened possibilities for concert tours in Ireland, Holland, Italy and France. Soon he was also performing and recording with songwriting colleagues such as Nikki Sudden, Phil Shoenfelt and Terry Lee Hale. In 1995 he moved to Greece, where he still enjoys a huge popularity.

Since then he has recorded two more albums there, "Thermaikos" (1999), and "With God And Her Sisters" (2003), both produced by Chris Eckman of the Walkabouts. Accompanied by his new Greek band "BIG SLEEP electric", he regularily plays the big stages of the country.

In 1988 he delivered 8 concerts as the "Official German Cultural Contribution to the Olympic Games" in Seoul, Korea.

Since four years he is also a member of the Greek top band "MPLE" ("Blue"), who constantly have hits in the charts, and attract large audiences wherever they play.

In 2010, as "BIG SLEEP acoustic", Stefan presented his new album "White Room". It contains 16 songs that are performed with acoustic guitar and voice exclusively. His style ranges from fragile etheric to wild and emotional.

The Welsh band Big Sleep released a single album called Bluebell Wood in 1971. The band had previously used the name Eyes of Blue. They broke up shortly after the album's release, with members going on to other bands such as Gentle Giant and Man. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Big+Sleep">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
