Stump could refer to an Anglo-Irish indie/experimental/rock group from London, or it could refer to a one-man Porno Goregrind project from Gravesend, Kent.

Stump were an Anglo-Irish indie/experimental/rock group featuring Mick Lynch (vocals), Kev Hopper (bass), Rob McKahey (drums) and Chris Salmon (guitar) formed in London in 1983.

Their first release was a four track EP Mud on a Colon,released in 1986 through the Ron Johnson record label. This was followed by a self-released mini album,Quirk Out,produced by Hugh Jones which included their cult hit Buffalo. Continuous UK touring, regular coverage in the UK music press - including cover features in both the NME and Melody Maker-and a memorable performance of Buffalo on Channel 4's The Tube ensured Quirk Out stayed in the UK Indie Charts for 26 weeks,peaking at number 2[1]. Sessions for the John Peel radio show recorded during this time were released as a Peel Sessions album on Strange Fruit Records in 1987. Following these successes the band were signed to Ensign Records.

An album A Fierce Pancake,released in 1988,was recorded in Berlin and London produced by Holger Hiller with assistance from Stephen Street. Three singles were released from this album:Chaos, Charlton Heston and a re-released Buffalo. The album did not bring the crossover success the label had hoped for and the band split before any new material was released. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Stump">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
