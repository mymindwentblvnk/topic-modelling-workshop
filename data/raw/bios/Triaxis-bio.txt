Triaxis are a British Heavy Metal band from Cardiff, Wales. 

"A genuinely creative spark and passion... bringing to mind classic Priest, mid-era Megadeth and Testament, intricately woven together with a taught melodic thread" 
ZERO TOLERANCE 

"A big hit at this years Bloodstock Festival... far too good to languish in self-sufficient obscurity. A confident and charismatic debut. Vocalist Krissie has the range and melodic intelligence of Heart's Ann Wilson, but with more than a dash of Dio's dramatic power"
