The long and arduous journey known today as Fusnota began at the turn of the century, with an idea, a few songs, and a group of people that never managed to be at the same place at the same time. Note that an idea, a few songs, and a line-up with conflicting schedules are pretty much what Fusnota is made of today. But I digress. The original line-up never made it to the stage, and Fusnota ended up taking a break for a while. Even though the band’s creator, Zlatko, had committed to another band (Under Darkened Skies), the idea of bringing Fusnota back again never really left his mind. So, upon leaving Under Darkened Skies and meeting Erina, who would become, and remain, the band’s lead vocalist, he took it upon himself to finish the demo recordings, find a new line-up, and give Fusnota its first live show.
Despite all expectations, all of the above happened. On the 28th of April, 2004, the band has its first gig, competing at that year’s Rock-fest (Skopje), followed by it’s second at the finals. Despite the widespread acceptance of the fact that Fusnota wasn't the best band that had, has, or will have ever played Rock-fest since its beginning almost 30 years ago, the band’s then-new drummer, Baltik (who also remains at this position to this very day), managed to persuade the organizers to let Fusnota guest star on the first evening of the following year’s festival.

Things haven’t changed much since then, actually. We still change line-ups frequently. We still play the old songs from the first days (including that Misfits song). And most importantly, we're still active :).
