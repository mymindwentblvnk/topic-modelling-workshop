Band Empyros was founded in Estonia at 2002. Band was guided by kinds of heavy music, which could combine not just speed and melodic at merging, but power and some agressive drive also. One of both guitarists, Roman has gravitated a Speed-Power direction, Alekso has prefered more rigid Thrash at the same time, and the Speed-Heavy-Thrash sound was obtained in result. It is why the songs don't contain one certain style in their contents. In 2007 year, a new bass player and drummer have joined the band, changing left in 2005 members, then band has started recording a first album "The Spectre of Ballantre". Frequent members changing hasn't allowed to make it earlier. Album was recorded at S.F.E.Records. It's a 8 tracks with a social theme lyrics. Now band is preparing and recording a stuff of following album, that'll contain about 9-10 songs, with ballade probably. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Empyros">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
