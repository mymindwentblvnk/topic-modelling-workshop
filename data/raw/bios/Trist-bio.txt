There are two artists named Trist: 1) A Czech black metal musician. 2) A German ambient black metal musician.

1) Trist is a depressive black metal solo project from the Czech Republic, which began in 2003. Trist originally started playing raw black metal, a similar style to bands such as Korium or Holomráz, which formed around the same time. However, after a few demo recordings the style shifted towards his own extremely depressive and suicidal-esque brand of black metal which released his true feelings about life to the world. Sparse vocals, monotonous and melancholic guitars with blazing distortion and simple, yet effective drum patterns. While being quite prolific in 2007 and 2008, thoughts followed to end the project. A short lived additional project called Zahrady Ticha was founded, but ended when Trist would continue, first noted with an instrumental demo in 2009. Trist has ended the activity silently after some time then.

2) Trist is an ambient black metal solo project from Germany, formed by Tristan, or Aran, from Lunar Aurora in the year 2000. The band's first album "Tiefenrausch" consisted purely of soothing ambient music, with the lyrics being poems written by Timo Kölling, who also reads these himself on the recording. In 2007 a double album titled "Hin-Fort" was released, with the first CD being a momumental ambient black metal track with the length of exactly one hour. In 2009 Trist released a third album titled "Willenskraft". Trist also contributed the exclusive song "Der Froschkönig" to the "Maere Compilation", released in 2010. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Trist">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
