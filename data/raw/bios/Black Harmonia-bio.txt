Founded in 2007, Black Harmonia suffers from Line-up's instabilities in the beginning but their music quickly evolves to a progressive approach of Thrash Metal with Heavy and Power Metal parts. They play a lot of gigs throughout Belgium and record a first EP in 2009 with 4 tracks. Months go by, as well as shows in different corners of Belgium and a second EP of 2 tracks is recorded in the beginning of 2010. Then in the end of 2011, the band plans to record the first album with a new, talented and stable line-up. Death Road, the first LP of Black Harmonia is released on 2013.
