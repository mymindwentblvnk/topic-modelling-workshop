Shadow Lawâ€™s Music creates an explosive dichotomy between the melodic elements of Power-Metal and the all out aggression of thrash, with a strong neo-classical edge underpinning much of the lead guitar work. 

The tracks feature a plethora of overindulgent guitar fret board wizardry, assaulting the auditory senses at adrenaline charged, break-neck speeds. However, a further element, in the form of epic and searing lead guitar breaks within the songs balance the testosterone charged sections with a battle winning flaunting of valiance that the majority of todays metal bands simply cannot match.
