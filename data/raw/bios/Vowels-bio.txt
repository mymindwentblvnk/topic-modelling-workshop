There are 3 musical artists known as VOWELS:

1) Vowels started as an Italian atmospheric post-black metal/ambient band, founded in 2008.
Nowadays they play slow, almost ritualistic ambient/neo-folk, not far from the style of groups like BOHREN UND DER CLUB OF GORE, TENHI, DEATH IN JUNE, ANGELO BADALAMENTI.
THey play a crossover of neo-folk, ambient and joir jazz.
They include also piano, cello, trumpets, bells, jew's harp, goathorns, synthethisers, and different haunting chants in their music.

2) vowels is the noise project of Bobby Griffiths, who runs Bad Drone Records and is one third of Golden Dawn Trio.

3) Vowels is a band comprising James Rutledge and drummer Chris Walmsley.
Like all Rutledge’s other work, it’s deep on the sonics, meticulously crafted and truly
mesmerising. Krautrock at heart, it’s a brutal and cosmic melange of sound and rhythm,
where Terry Riley like keyboard motifs entwine with Battles intensity drumming and
clouds of audio detritus, gamelan gongs, rewired synthesisers and clashing feedback guitars.
Oscillating between pools of crystal clear ambience and miasmic clouds of dense noise,
it somehow manages to span whole decades of musical exploration: the fractured psych
dreams of The United States of America, the dense weave of Stockhausen’s Hymnen,
the intensity of Conrad Schnitzler era Tangerine Dream, the mind altering drones of
Growing and the ferocious sonic assault of Boredoms.
Epic in scope and faultless in its execution The Pattern Prism is surely a contender for
one of the most inspirational and intense rock albums of the year.
