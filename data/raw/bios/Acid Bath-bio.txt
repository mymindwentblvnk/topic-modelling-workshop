Acid Bath was an American metal band from Houma, Louisiana that lasted from 1991 to 1997. They released their breakout debut When the Kite String Pops in 1994, which was then followed by their sophomore and final album, Paegan Terrorism Tactics, in 1996. The band later broke up in 1997 after the passing of bassist Audie Pitre in a traffic collision. 

Their music is often regarded as hard to label under one certain genre. While sweeping across many sounds, Acid Bath put out two records of considerable influence, which opened a gateway for heavy metal music to be versatile and emotional without sacrificing its creative character or brute force. Their music incorporates influences ranging from sludge, doom metal, death metal, hardcore punk, stoner rock, thrash metal and grunge.

The variation in their music has reached far from the underground music into many hardcore, doom metal and stoner rock bands. Frontman Dax Riggs currently performs a solo artist, although he was the singer and guitarist for Agents of Oblivion. He then played for Deadboy & the Elephantmen. Guitarist Sammy Duet played in Crowbar for some time. He now plays for Goatwhore. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Acid+Bath">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
