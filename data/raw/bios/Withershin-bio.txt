From the howling abyss, The Beast shall rise

The vile entity known as Withershin was spawned in 2006. Its inevitable conception was the result of the founding members’ desire to take previous musical efforts and ambitions to a higher level.
Withershin creates potent and devastating black metal,
exploring the darkness without limitations.

The first offering, “Chaos Discipline“, was recorded and released roughly a year after the bands cursed birth. A few months later, having recruited the powerful vocalist Nine, Withershin sealed a pact with the American label Canonical Hours for the release of the debut album.

“Ashen Banners“, a work of pure wrath and terror, was recorded in studio Endarker during february 2008 and unchained on may 30th. Following the release, Withershins first live performances took place during the fall.

The seals have been broken, the point of no return passed. Withershin is now working with piercing ferocity on what is to be the second release. During 2009 the band will also further its destructive mission on stage.

Under banners of war, Withershin marches with zeal and dedication. The profoundly violent and uncontrollable force that fuels the band never rests.

While some are illuminated by the black light, most will perish in its flames. And as this world is nullified, the foundations of a new Era will be cast from the ashes and ruins. Passion, ruthlessness and the unwavering devotion to walk against all currents brings sight beyond the veil.
