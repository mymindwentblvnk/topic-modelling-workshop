With reason in mind and sledge hammers in hand; Apeiron Restraint is a band you need to hear. A militant atheist, a christian, a libertarian, a hardcore gamer and an overdressed chemist have converged into a unique metal experience. With backgrounds spanning from jazz fusion, church music, prog and extreme death metal, the resulting product is a strict and icy composite metal that’ll rock you like Newton’s cradle. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Apeiron+Restraint">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
