By Self-efforts Only, Excimer Was Formed in Alexandria, Egypt in June, 2013 Established to form the Alexandrian Thrash Metal Scene. Mainly Influenced by the NWOBHM Like Iron Maiden, Judas Priest and Mot√∂rhead and by the Early Thrash Metal Bands Like Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth, Exodus, Overkill, Testament, Vio-Lence, Kreator, Sodom and Artillery. Being the First of Its Kind, in Egypt, Throws a Heavy Responsibility on the Band's Chest to Give a Thrashing, Heavy, and Harsh Sounds. The Band Faced Problems Since Thrash Metal Isn't Popular in the Egyptian Metal Scene, and The Unstable Political Issues Are from Those Problems, Also the 25th January Revolution and the 30th June Revolution Are from the Main Influences of the Band. The Idea Was Created Around 2010 When Ramii and Amr Started Poor Jams, and Weak Performance, But the Band Became Real Around the End of 2012 by Constructing a Stable Line Up, and by Composing Music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Excimer">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
