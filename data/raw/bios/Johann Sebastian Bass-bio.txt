Johann Davidus Bass, Johann Martinus Bass and Johann Domenicus Bass were born in the slums of Vienna and Munich between 1725 and 1732. Maternally unrelated, they are said to share the same father. Rumour has it that they are the product of love affairs of a famous composer, which were to this day kept secret by various biographers. Three young men brought together by poverty and artistic necessity, the as-yet unacquainted half-siblings formed an engineering and art collective that was the envy of the international community. This led them to Paris, upon the orders of the King of France. Tasked with building a machine of epic proportions and importance, they moved to the Royal Court of Versailles to complete their masterwork. But lo, disaster strikes! The machine, upon being presented to King Louis XV himself, toppled and fell upon the dashing monarch, badly wounding the king between the fourth and fifth rib.rnDue to political unrest at the time, the royal consultants advised that the King should cover up this embarrassing incident as an assassination attempt. A mentally unstable servant named Robert François Damiens was to be the scapegoat, and was executed in a horrific manner. Our three heroes were to be punished by being sent back in time.rnInstead of landing in the past, the time machine sent the brothers spiralling, freefalling into the future - and they landed face down in the year 2011. Since Johann Davidus Bass, Johann Martinus Bass and Johann Domenicus Bass have embraced their mutual heritage, and are working as a dance band known only as “Johann Sebastian Bass”. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Johann+Sebastian+Bass">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
