Future Clouds and Radar is Robert Harrisonâ€™s follow-up to his band Cotton Mather. The first album, an eponymous double CD, was released in 2007. Their second release, entitled "Peoria" was released on the 4th of November, 2008 on the Star Apple Kingdom label.
Like Cotton Mather, Future Clouds and Radar has been described as being of the powerpop genre. Austinist called Future Clouds and Radar "Beatles-esque psychedelia" while the New Yorker described it as "sprawling orchestral art rock."

Upon release of the debut CD, NPR wrote:

It's up for debate whether Austin-based Robert Harrison's double-disc debut is pure genius with blind ambition, or the product of an excess of ideas. In any case, his band Future Clouds and Radar certainly knows how to entertain. The self-titled album crosses a dozen different styles and gets handed numerous genre-definers, all of which include the word "art" as a prefix. Future Clouds and Radar would seem to be inspired by The Flaming Lips or Guided By Voices, whose prolificacy Harrison emulates.
