Stone Magnum from Michigan City, Indiana is an entity of sorrow, misery and woe. With a style rooted in hook laden doom metal, Stone Magnum explores the dark forces controlling man’s submissive existence. With a wide list of influences, Stone Magnum presents a broad offering of traditional, epic, depressive, and darkened doom metal with hints of traditional heavy metal stylings.

Formed in August 2010, Stone Magnun began merely as  an outlet of personal misery and soon evolved into the next powerful Midwest Doom Metal entity.   As scene insiders began to take notice, it was only a matter of months before Stone Magnum was sharing the stage in support of notable bands such as Earthen Grave, The Gates Of Slumber, Slough Feg, and NWOBHM legends, Raven, among others.
 
Tavernier (guitarist/vocals) along with original drummer, “Mad” Brad Toth, saw a number of lineup changes before the four stones of “Magnum” became solidified when guitarist Jim Brucks (Black Rhoades/Quadra) and bassist Marty Buchaus (Black Rhoades/Latent Fury) joined the fold. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Stone+Magnum">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
