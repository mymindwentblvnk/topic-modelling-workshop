Houston producer and vocalist keshi has beautifully progressed since first releasing music in 2017. Initially crafting lofi beats and using his voice as an added layer of the instrumental, Keshi has since evolved into a genuine singer/songwriter.

Blending hypnotic bumps with flower petal lullabies, his sorrowful and emotional tracks feel like dancing with the lights off. Like crying and smiling at the same time. Perhaps a fitting manifesto of his music can be heard on the track “onoffonoff,” when Keshi sings “kiss me when you hurt me.” Emotional, heartfelt, and sincere, his bedroom blues will remain in your head for days/weeks to come.
