There are several bands called as DISLIKE:

1. Dislike is a grindcore band from Pozega, Croatia. Dislike was formed in 1997. by Dena & Kukatz with the aim of playing classic dis crust beats in the vein of Doom, Discharge, Hiatus... Soon, Smole and Gera joined the band, and they recorded their first demo in 1998. that was released as a split tape with Czech grind/crust band Mrtva Buducnost. It was called "Hell Is Here". A few years later another demo is realeased called "Crust Is Dead" featuring 3 more bands from their area(Starvation, Fight Back and Apatridi). In the following years Kukatz left and the band changed their sound a bit. In early 2006. Dislike released "Ctrl". On "Ctrl" more influences from metal and grindcore can be heard.
