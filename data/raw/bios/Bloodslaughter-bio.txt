German death metal band formed in 1985. They were originally from Itzehoe, Schleswig-Holstein, but in 1986 the twin brothers Rotten (guitarist and vocalist) and Torment (guitarist) had to move with their parents to MÃ¼nster, North Rhine-Westphalia. The brothers wanted to keep the band going on, so they formed a new band called Slaughterhammer as a duo, but whenever they had the chance to play with Wange (drummer), they would do so under the name Bloodslaughter. They never had a bass player. They released four demos:
1986 - Rehearsal 06-1986
1987 - Cannibalistic Massacre
1987 - Rehearsal 01-1987
