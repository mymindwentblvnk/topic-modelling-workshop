[PT] Neuropsy was formed in the beginning of 2016. We started (or rather continued) as an inception of two previous band formations and musical directions within extreme music. Starting in late 2012 as a Deathcore/Death Metal band called Over My Dead Body with 3 of the original members present today. After a change in the line up, a new vocalist and a second guitarist, we decided to close that band and start a new one, Vitae. Leaving the Deathcore influences behind from the previous band, Vitae was based on the Death Metal style, while bringing influences from other kinds of Metal. The band eventually went on hiatus in 2014 due to lack of money and other issues. After 2 years of getting some financial stability and gathering resources and connects, working on our personal musical techniques, we decided to re-launch our band with a new name and a new style of music.
