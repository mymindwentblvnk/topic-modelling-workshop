There are two bands named Lonewolf:


1) Lonewolf is a French speed / heavy metal band formed in 1991 in Claix.
2) Lonewolf is Oi! band from USA.

1) LONEWOLF was born near GRENOBLE (France). 
A first demo tape is recorded : "The Calling", with Félix (lead guitar), Jens (guitare and lead vocals), Roland (bass) and Renaud (drums), wich got very good feedbacks in the heavy-metal underground and was sold more than 450 copies. It will be re-released in 2002 under the name of  Walpurgis Night.

The line-up has changed : Félix on drums, Stéphan on lead guitar, Jens on guitar and lead-vocals et Roland on bass. The 7" vinyl single "Holy Evil" was born the same year. Again, this record know very great reviews and feedbacks around the world (Japan, Grece, Germany, Belgium, USA, Portugal, Spain, etc...). More than 2000 copies were sold today.
In 1996, The band splited up because a bad contract. LONEWOLF will stay dead 4 years.

But in 2000, a "test line-up" was formed, and, less than a year, "March Into The Arena" see the light, released and produced by  LONEWOLF with FELIX (drums), DRYSS (bass), MARK (lead guitar) and JENS (guitar and lead vocals). Cover and logo was made by the talented Jean-Pascal FOURNIER (Immortal, Edguy, Avantasia, Impaled Nazarene, Nightmare...). This album know good reviews in magazines fanzines, webzines, of many countries (Germany, Spain, Grece, Italy, Switzerland, USA,...)

With spring 2001 came the contract with GOI MUSIC, a spanish label. "March Into The Arena" was re-released and markted in a bigger way, via promotions, distributions, etc... including a bonus track  "Children of the Unlight". In the year, Mark must leave the band .  Few weeks later, Dams integrated Lonewolf on lead guitar. His first gig was with Grave Digger for their first show in France.

LONEWOLF give a lot of gigs around France and  beyond its borders, as the SwordBrother Festival et le Metal Bash in Germany, the Heavy Metal Holocaust in Grece... Lonewolf was on the same stage with GRAVE DIGGER, NIGHTMARE, MISANTHROPE, WIZARD, PAUL DiANNO, SABATON, PARAGON, DARK AGE, TORMENT and more...

In 2003, the 7" vinyl single "HELLENIC WARRIORS" is out, specialy dedicated to greek fans and friends who made LONEWOLF the first french Heavy Metal band to play in Grece.
2006, a third album est recorded, but in waiting for a new label and see the light. As Lonewolf is now without GOI MUSIC, the band is seeking a new label.

As Dryss left France and LONEWOLF in September 2006 (now living in Québec and play bass in the Canadian Power Metal band ICEWIND), Alex HILBERT from (and still in) NIGHTMARE now play bass in LONEWOLF only for concerts, by friendship.
