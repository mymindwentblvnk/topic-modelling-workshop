Music Hates You are a loud, uncompromising assault on the senses.  Bring sunglasses for their blinding stage lights, always aimed at the audience.  Bring earplugs for the volume.  Bring as many drugs and beers as you can consume, or come stone cold sober.  Just don't expect MHY to give a fuck about you or give you anything but a middle finger and their complete devotion to the music.  This is dirt metal at its finest. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Music+Hates+You">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
