Zwartketterij make a statement with being primitive, non-compromising and hard as fuck. Dressed in denim, leather, bullets and spikes and their faces painted as necrotized demons they go back to the early eighties when bands like Celtic Frost, Bathory, Venom and Slayer started to play heavy-metal with a more dark and occult character. Building forth on this principle Zwartketterij brings you a mixture of dirty, palm-muting based. primitive thrash-metal with both clean vocals and devastating demon shrieks. This in combination with lyrics about metal, demons, spanking the bitches, alcohol and blasphemy they create their typical "Necro-sound", which covers all the main metal-genres of the eighties, only dirtier, much dirtier! From their start in 1999 till now, Zwartketterij have 3 official soundspankers on their name, namely: - The Black Heresy (demo) - Sodomizer Dirty Sodomizer (full-length album) and "Cult Of The Necro-Thrasher" (full-length album).

In 2008 the band split up, but in 2012 Zwartketterij was brought to life again by Jack Hellfire, who currently is working on new songs.
