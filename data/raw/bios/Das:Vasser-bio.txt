"DAS:VASSER" means "the water" in German (though slightly misspelled, as it should be "Wasser"), a name that wasn't chosen unintentionally, as Kyouhei explained once. Just like water -always changing its shape, always in motion- the band has been developing both visually and musically further and further, thus creating their very own style.

DAS:VASSER started as your average visual kei indies band, with lots of make-up and clothes typical for Matina bands.

Their music has been pretty original from the very beginning, though. With their dark, melancholic and (at times) hard but melodious sound they quickly gained popularity among visual kei fans resulting in their live shows and demotapes selling out quickly.

Through the years they've kept changing their look (from vinyl outfits, long velvet skirts and heavy make-up to suits and much lighter make-up), toning down gradually. Their sound became lighter, too. However, that doesn't mean the band forgot their roots as they managed to put out albums containing both hard ("Matina-style") songs and straight rock songs.

Ichirou and Tarou leaving DAS:VASSER marked a great turn in the band's history, how this is going to affect the music is still to be seen...  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/DAS:VASSER">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
