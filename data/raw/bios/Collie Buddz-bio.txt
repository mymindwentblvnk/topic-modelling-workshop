Collie Buddz (born Colin Patrick Harper, August 21, 1984) is a reggae artist best known for his single "Come Around".[1] Although born in New Orleans, Louisiana, he was raised in Bermuda. He studied audio engineering at Full Sail University in Orlando, FL.[2] He performed on Shaggy's 2007 album Intoxication on the track "Mad Mad World". In 2008, he performed the song "SOS" on WWE The Music, Vol. 8 as the entrance theme for wrestler Kofi Kingston. He also appeared in a 2009 remix of Kid Cudi's single "Day 'n' Nite". His name is based on slang for cannabis, and he has been photographed[3] flaunting a device commonly used for its consumption.[4] He launched his own record label 'Harper Digital.' Buddz has built an extensive touring machine, selling out venues across the US and worldwide. He is currently on tour in Amphitheaters with Rebelution, Matisyahu and Zion I on the Good Vibes tour. Buddz' festival appearances include Lollapalooza, Outside Lands, Summer Jam, Reggae on the Rocks, California Roots Festival, UCLA JazzReggae, Seattle City Arts festival, and the Marley Family's 9 Mile Music Festival, among others.

Collie Buddz employs a style that is strongly rooted in 1990's era conscious and dancehall style reggae, using beats and vocal techniques reminiscent of the iconic stars of that day - including Sizzla, Buju Banton, Bounty Killer and Beenie Man. The singer has attributed  the defining influences on his music to lyrical clashes (such as those between Beenie Man and Bounty Killer) and dubplates, particularly those of Kilimanjaro, that were core to the sound clash culture of the 90's. 

Buddz is an avid fan of Buju Banton and cites that artist's "Mr. Mention" has one of his favorite albums. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Collie+Buddz">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
