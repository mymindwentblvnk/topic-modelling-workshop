There are two bands named 9MM.

1) Band from Italy
2) Band from Germany


1) Mix up the purity of punk,the melodiousness of pop and a bit of hardcore fury and you'll have 9mm. This five pieces combo formed in Rome, Italy, in the first months of year 2000. Passing through various line up changes during the early years, the band has grown a unique strength and a deep convinction that everyone's effort brings results. Former drummers Bastiano and Luketto, now respectively playing in other bands such as POAH and Vanilla sky, helped growing 9mm lending their sweat to the recordings of the band first and second demos (2000-2001) and the 9mm's very first full lenght "lo giuro" (2001-2002). Third former drummer Lucio played drums in the promotional 2003 ep. In spite of all misfortunes and changes, Lead singer Francesco and bass player Dado, in the band since the beginning, always kept 9mm alive with new motivations and always found the strength to rebuild their creature from ashes. In january 2004,in fact,the arrival of new drummer Leo, with his unique sound and style, gives to the band the so long waited fuel. All the things the guys learned during these past years now see the light in 9mm's new work coming out in 2005, recorded by producer Daniele Autore (also singer for vanilla sky band). However the misfortunes seem not finished yet as Leo,in december 2005 leave the band to give more time to other things.From december to february Luketto partially "re-join" the band helping out his old friends to get out of troubles, till the half of february 2006 when the new 9MM Drummer Andrea Papero is ready to rock as hell. 9MM get back on the road with more passion than ever.On the edge is 6000 copies far.
