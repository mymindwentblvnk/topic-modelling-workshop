ATENTADO from Barcelona, Spain:
Band comes from Barcelona. This four piece plays amaizing raw punk with d-beat simple but perfect drums, totally distorted guitar, strong bass lines and incredible female punk voice in the top of everything. Has members of Über, Horrör, Siberiä to name a few. Broke up at the end of 2012 shortly after the release of their Dias De Rabia 12" mini-album on La Vida Es Un Mus.

ATENTADO from Lisbon, Portugal:
ATENTADO from lisbon was created already in 1992, but it has been after a hiatus of 20 years when the bassist Pedro Vale decided to re-activate the project with a new line-up. the band can be a name to add to the list of acts like BLACK BREATH or TRAP THEM or the latest ROTTEN SOUND, bands with a high influence by crust metal and also the sound create in early 90's by ENTOMBED: swedish old school death metal guitar sound, and basic influences from bands like ANTI CIMEX, DISCHARGE, DOOM o CELTIC FROST, makes them to be and act at the same level like other crust-souding bands like the swedish SKITSYSTEM, VICTIMS or DISFEAR.

ATENTADO are not new in the musical scene, some of their members has been playing or play in bands like TWENTY INCH BURIAL, or WE ARE THE DAMNED, the other project of half all their members.

ATENTADO's first album "paradox" will come out next september, released by the portuguese label Ragingplanet Records and it will be a blasting and raw crust metal punk atttack just comparable to bands like the americans BLACK BREATH.
