Asunder was a funeral doom metal band from Oakland, California that formed in 1998; they called it quits in November 2009. Their most recent release before the split was Works Will Come Undone on Profound Lore Records. Their songs had become longer and more sorrowful as the band progressed. The band collaborated with Corrupted, and the recording of that live collaboration, though never formally released, can be found on many internet sources. In the wake of Asunder's break-up, John Gossard has formed a new band, Dispirit. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Asunder">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
