Antipop Consortium veteran High Priest. Harnessing his well-publicized and passionate obsession for experimental electronics, classic hip-hop, and modern commercial techniques, what we end up with is funky doom-ridden recordings of skewed analogue beat-mangling and low-light beat poems. High Priest's work is vast and far-reaching. He can also be found in the dynamic duo called Airborn Audio with M. Sayyid (also formerly of Antipop Consortium). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/High+Priest">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
