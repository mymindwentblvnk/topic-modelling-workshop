Head:Stoned is a band formed in 2006 in Porto (Portugal), by Augusto Peixoto, drums (Cycles | ex.Dove | ex.In Solitude | ex.Paradigma) after Pedro Gouveia, vocals (ex.Dove | ex.Fears Tomb | ex.Pitch Black) convince him to create a new band. Meanwhile Carlos Barbosa, guitar (ex.Cycles | ex.Fears Tomb/Karnak), Pedro Vieira, guitar (ex.Withering) and Henrique Loureiro, bass (ex.Cycles) joined the band. HEADSTONE played the first show @ Porto Rio Bar in 04 November 2006. After this great event, both Pedro Gouveia and Henrique Loureiro, left the band but they were quickly replaced by the vocalist Vítor Franco (ex.Stillness In Chaos/Outshine) and the bassist Vera Sá  (Cycles). The band has been playing in various events from north to south of Portugal and opened concerts for major bands such as the well known British band, Onslaught. HEADSTONE recorded in the SOUNDVISION's Studios the "Within The Dark" E.P. and few months after its release the success was amazing. Carlos Barbosa left HEADSTONE on September 2009 and was replaced by Nuno Silva (Cycles). HEADSTONE has composed new songs and entered again in the SOUNDVION'S Studios to record the first album "I Am All" which is now finished. After being contacted by another band who claims the right for the band's name, decided to change it's name for HEAD:STONED. "I Am All" will be released in October by the portuguese Label MAJOR LABEL INDUSTRIES.
