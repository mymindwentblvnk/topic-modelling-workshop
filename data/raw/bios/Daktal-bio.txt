Daktal stands out from the crowd and defy catagorization with their unique songwriting abilities. Bassist Vrate Gill and drummer Shawn Parker lay down the tight grooves over which Greg Santora (guitar) and Ted Parks (vocals) magically ride on top of; to create as a whole, a very interesting musical landscape full of twists and turns. With just one listen most people have been impressed by the many riffs and hooks that make up their songs. 

Daktal delivers the goods with a solid performance and stage presence. There is nothing these guys like to do better than rocking your ass off. They look at it like a personal challenge to do better and better each time. Most believe its ingrained in their psychological make up, seems its all they care about (you will have to see them in their element to understand).  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Daktal">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
