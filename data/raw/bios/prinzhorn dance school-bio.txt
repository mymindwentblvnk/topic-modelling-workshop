Prinzhorn Dance School are Tobin Prinz and Suzi Horn. Their music is sparse, uncompromising and idiosyncratic.

They are signed to the New York record label DFA. Their debut release for the label was a self recorded and self produced 7-inch single featuring the tracks "You Are The Space Invader" and "Eat, Sleep" which was limited to 500 copies only (but is still readily available on the second hand market).

Prinz and Horn recorded their debut album in isolation, in a rented barn in Sussex, having already written the songs in the disused chapel building they call home, also entirely on their own. The album was sebsequently mixed in New York with The DFA and was released on August 13, 2007 in the UK and on August 27, 2007 in North America.

The band are known to be reclusive, with very few interviews given, and their own official website rarely features any images of their faces. Media-shy - in that they find photo-shoots vain, press releases dishonest and superlatives embarrassing â€“ they prefer the isolation of their working space, writing and recording privately in their own austere and peculiar way.

The band are building a dedicated following with impressive live shows and have completed several UK and European tours, although their American tour was famously cancelled due to visa problems.

It is believed they have taken their name from Dr Hans Prinzhorn, who collected art by mentally ill patients under his care.
