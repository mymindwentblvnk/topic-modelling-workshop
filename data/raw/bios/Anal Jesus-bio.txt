1. Anal Jesus was a Morningstar side project that released three rehearsal/demo tapes in 1993 before supposedly changing name to Warmaul. The project appears to have been abandoned shortly after the name change.

Petrified #3 had reviews of the first two demos, describing Sado-Ritual "...decent "Sado-Metal" band with all the lyrics blasted in Finnish... The production/recording is extremely bad on some tracks, but quite clear on the others... The music is mostly mid-paced with the vocals presented in Death Metal fashion" 
On Noise-Ritual he wrote "...more in the vein of Impaled Nazarene... The music is a sick/demented form of Sado/Masochistic metal with self-torture recorded live on tape. ...Tracks range from seconds long to minutes - maybe a grindcore style... This putrid blood bathing is only recommended for warped individuals..."
