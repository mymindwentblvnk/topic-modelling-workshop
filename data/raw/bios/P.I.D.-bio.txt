This artist is (or was) also known as: Preachas.

P.I.D. or Preachers in Disguise made their debut nationally in 1988 with the album Here We Are on Graceland, before releasing the record independently as a music cassette.

The crew consisted of Barry Hogan also known as Barry G., Fred Lynch and DJ Selecta. Barry G. departed after three albums. The Chosen Ones in 1991 was his last record for PID. This album was also the introduction of Fred lynch's brother K-mack the Knife.

P.I.D. are one of the founders of the Holy Hip Hop scene in the United States. Stephen Wiley was the first HHH artist, then Michael Peace and just after DC Talk, came P.I.D.'s breakthrough.

P.I.D. changed their name into Preacha's after four albums and released their last record Violent playgrounds in 1993. This album was the fruit of their labour of love they finally got the production process under control and the album is considered one of the best Holy Hip Hop albums of the time.
The final line up was Ace MC, Fred Lynch and K-mack the Knife. K-mack is the brother of Fred Lynch.
But just after the release of Violent Playgrounds Fred's brother K-mack became a member of the Nation of Islam. Since Fred could only rap about his christian faith this was the end of P.I.D./Preachas. The brothers are still close and Fred Lynch is still active with the gospel and rap activities.

On January 2008 Ace MC announced Preachas are working on a new project and they will return as Fred Lynch and Ace One. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/P.I.D.">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
