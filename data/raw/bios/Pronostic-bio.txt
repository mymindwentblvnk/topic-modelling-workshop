"It all started with a lady on scooter who was so hungry for chocolate cake...

And then, from a piece of cake and a lot of substance abuse, Pronostic emerged. Charles and Alex joined forces to elaborate their evil plan to conquer the music scene. So, as a newborn team, they picked up their state-of-the-art tape cassette recorder and laid out their conception of crazy creativity and violent music.

One night, Nicholas, aka Le Fou, sneaked in the other’s lair. As soon as he heard the duo’s melodies and beats, he knew this could lead to so much power and prestige.

Then, meeting for months in a cabin deep in the wood, jamming there and living burlesque adventures it would be so inappropriate to tell here, the band released their first album, Deviated Inner Spectrum. And it was pretty deviated. A little gnomish slave took the bass spot for the album, followed by another metal head, followed by Mathieu, who was happily found in a garbage bag at the back of the cabin.

Pronostic's plan is now launched and it will blow your f&#%@ mind!" <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/pronostic">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
