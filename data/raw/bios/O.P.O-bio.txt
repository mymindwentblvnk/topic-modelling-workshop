Brazilian Drone Doom project created by Frater Danoch.
O.P.O is a solo project created by Frater Danoch (all guitars, effects and screams of agony). This project tries to rescue the subconscious perceptions, to create a contemplative sensation in the listener. The sound is full dissonant guitars, industrial effects, noise and screams. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/O.P.O">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
