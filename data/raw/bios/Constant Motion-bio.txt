The band changed it's name into Reflections of Reality due to obvious reasons.

Progressive-metal band Constant Motion was formed in Iasi, Romania, in December 2006 by Iustin and Costel (Q). In the same year they had a meeting with Alex and collaborated on writing the music for this progressive-metal project. Soon after that George and Ilinca joined the band. Between 2007 and 2008, Constant Motion worked with Paul (keyboards), but he decided join OpIS Band, because of his passion for jazz. In 2008 Constant Motion released a self â€“ produced Demo, containing 3 tracks:
1. Nothing
2. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder part I
