Incarnia are a melodic death metal band hailing from Montreal, Canada. The band was conceived under the name Destroy the Source, back in August 2006, with members Todd Douglas (bass), Matthew Gosselin (drums) and Jeremy Vocino (guitar). In the months to come, members Vincent Grenier (keyboard), Thomas Szwedska (guitar) and Marc Alexandre (vocals) were added to the group, forming the current line-up. 

With the release of their newest 7 track effort, entitled "Proclamation," Incarnia are poised to take their rightful place in the metal community.
The dawn of a new era approaches 

Yet sadly enough, as of July 7, 2011 Incarnia has disbanded. The statement from the band's Facebook page is as follows;

"Ladies and gentlemen, I have very sad news for you;



Incarnia have decided to disband after sharing 6 awesome years together. Over the past two years, it became apparent that some were losing the passion we once shared as when we were rocking out to "The Plague" and "Black Brimstone Horrors." There was a strong lack of commitment by some, which in turn brought everyone else's drive down."
