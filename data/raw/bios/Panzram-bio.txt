PANZRAM is made up of John and Joe who both play in MERKIT. When MERKIT became a less active, the two of us decided to start something new. This band, unlike MERKIT, was formed out of the ugliness both of us were feeling and is a bit darker and more unhappy than MERKIT, or any of our previous bands. John and I both play different instruments that neither of us completely feel at home with and I think that lends itself well to the noisy, slightly off kilter brand of hardcore that we play. PANZRAM have a demo out as well as a song on the comp, "The World Itself Is A Bad Dream" on Drugged Conscience Records, and went on a 10 day tour in the summer of '09.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Panzram">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
