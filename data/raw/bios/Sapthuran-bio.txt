Sapthuran is a one-man black metal project from Covington, Kentucky in the United States. It is a solo project of Patrick Hall. Sapthuran was once named Enthralled, and the music is a mix between mournful acoustic interludes, Nokturnal Mortum folk-stylings, and Burzum-esque misanthropic naturistic black metal. Sapthuran recently did a split with Wrest's project Leviathan. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sapthuran">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
