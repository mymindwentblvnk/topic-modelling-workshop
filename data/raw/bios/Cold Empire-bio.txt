July 2006: Cold Empire was created from a concept of Misanthrone (also from the band: Mutilated Soul).
"Cold Empire is the emotionlessness of humanity but it's also a representation of an enchanted forest in the depths of winter"
The founding members are Misanthrone (vocals), Valker (guitars,also in Streben), Dark Shadow (drums, also in Streben) and Necrocultus (bass). Our desire is to create dark and obscure black metal similar to the style of the Scandinavian scene from the early 90's.

September 2006: The Official Cold Empire logo was finalized, the design was done by Vandenis, a personal friend from Lithuania.

October 2006: The band entered the V-Studio of Villy Cocco to record the first two songs in a raw live version.

Early 2007: "Work in progress" Cold Empire worked on two new songs that will appear in the debut cd.

Spring 2007: The band starts recording sessions for "...And The Cold Arrived". Drums, guitars and bass tracks are recorded in our home studio while vocals are done at V-Studio (also where the final mixing is completed). At the same time Necrocultus decides to leave the band for personal reasons.

June 2007: Our first release is ready! Tracklist: 1) Cold Empire, 2) Storms Will Rise, 3) Nocturnal Sea, 4) Forest Of Hate. Artwork by Vandenis.

July 2007: Cold Empire was discovered by Bleak Art Records and offered a contract to release a debut full length album in late 2008.
