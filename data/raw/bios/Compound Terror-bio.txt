Compound Terror is a grindcore/death metal band from Victoria, Canada that was formed in late 2007 by (ex-)members of Iskra, and Acting Ensign. They notably use elements of noise (such as samplers and feedback/vocal loops) alongside eight-stringed guitar and drum triggers. Their lyrical themes include, but are not limited to: politics, scientific literature, and videogaming culture.

Compound Terror released their demo free on the internet and limited run CD-R in late 2008 to positive reviews from local zines and websites.  Compound Terror's second release was a 7" split with The Communion from New York, released by Midnight Sea and Just Say No! in early 2009. Currently they are working on their sixteen track full-length. They have performed with acts such as Poser Disposer, Defenestrate, Iskra, and Massgrave.
