It's been called rock... metal... hardcore...hard rock... no one has ever really been able to put a specific label on it... and with good reason.

In this day and age of "cookie cutter" and "built-to-specs" music acts, there are a million different bands doing the same thing... carrying the "clone-rock" torch. In a media manipulated world of fitting-in and playing for money, being original or standing out has become a taboo subject... and rarely does anyone break any rules and make something their own.

Enter Adrenaphine... by mixing the styles and sounds of the early pioneers all the way up to modern day heavyweights, Adrenaphine have come up with a formula. Without fearing the mainstream rejection process and the volatile world of talentless bar bands, they have become a concrete fixture in local heavy music. Joining hard rock, metal, stoner, southern, and alternative influences in the same song has produced a monster of a new breed. Pure and clear... heavy and melodic... angry yet sympathetic... The emotions and textures of Phine's output can be called eclectic yet well formed and solid.

The music is what matters... not the look... not the attitude... not the money... and surely not fitting in.
