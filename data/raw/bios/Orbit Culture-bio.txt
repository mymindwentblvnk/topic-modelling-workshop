Orbit Culture is a melodic death metal/groove metal band from Eksjö, Sweden. The idea of the band grew strong within singer & rhythm guitarist Niklas and lead guitarist Maximilian after messing around with some unpolished demos at home. At that time, Maximilian was currently playing with another local band called Abstract Noise, together with Orbit Culture’s fellow drummer Markus Bladh. Maximilian recruited Markus to join his new band, followed by the arrival of Christoffer Olsson on bass guitar. The band formed in March 2013. Shortly after Orbit Culture's inception, the band started to work on their debut EP. The production ended on August 17th, 2013 and Orbit Culture's very first piece of music was released shortly after. All the songs were recorded in what used to be an old power plant in the bands hometown. The EP was mixed and mastered by Niklas himself. Later that year, the band re-released their debut EP.

After some positive feedback and reviews both nationally and internationally the band quickly started working on their first full-length album. Through an intense process of songwriting, recording, mixing and mastering the band finally finished and released their first full-length album called “In Medias Res” on the 23rd of July, 2014. The album concept builds on a war between the race of men and machines.

Later lead guitarist Maximilian decided to leave the band to pursue other interests. Even though a close friend and important musician in the band had left, the band felt that the new album was not enough. After almost two and half years of writing and recording new and more powerful songs, the finished album came to be known as “Rasen”. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Orbit+Culture">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
