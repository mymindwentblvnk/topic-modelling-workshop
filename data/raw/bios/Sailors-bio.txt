Alan & Diego, two brothers residing out of Monterrey,MX, decided after years of producing, it was time to make a name for themselves. Since then, Sailors was born. After producing for 7 consecutive years as simply a hobby, the duo dropped their studies and decided to pursue their passion and love for music. Together they planned to make music that would take listeners to an imaginary and soothing place.
 
After just a few months of releasing free tracks via their soundcloud, they gained over 2 million plays, further proving their talents. With several official releases in the works as well as exciting remixes, 2015 is looking up to be the break the Sailors have been waiting for! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sailors">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
