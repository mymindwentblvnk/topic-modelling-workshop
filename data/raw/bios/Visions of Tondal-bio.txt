In the first cantiche of La Divina Commedia Dante describes the Inferno as a place shrouded with endless darkness filled with diabolic whines. Visions of Tondal are that darkness, those whines; they understand the music as a type of madness - the sickness of the soul, that is why they are able to merge genres that seem so apart, so different and the result is a music filled with the whole spectrum of emotions, energy and climaxes.
