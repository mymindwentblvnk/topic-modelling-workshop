In a genre viewed by some as being stuffed to the gills with clones of clones, Mountains Became Machines stand apart. Their unique sound is influenced by contemporary and classic artists from many genres, without falling into incoherency and maintains a solid originality throughout. Conceptual themes are carried throughout each recording, and delicate dynamics sit side by side with walls of sound. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mountains+Became+Machines">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
