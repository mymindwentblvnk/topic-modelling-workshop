True Story. When those words are used in telling a story it invokes curiosity. We want to know more details. It’s not a figment of someone’s infinite imagination, it’s actual reality, and we want to know more. Time was ticking as the events unfolded. The characters lived and breathed. This is True Story’s foundation. This is their amazing call. They are the bearers of more than rhythms and lyrics. They have the greatest love story of all to tell in their songs, and it is absolutely true. Bringing word and lyric together to paint the picture of Jesus is True Story’s greatest charge in life. Their passion for this task is evident and there is no timidity to their music. The words to their songs are not poetry, they are a heart wrenching suicide note, telling of spiritual life coming from death. Music and words combust, exploding in their performances. There is simply no way they could stand politely and tell that story . . . the story of the cross . . . the story of love.
