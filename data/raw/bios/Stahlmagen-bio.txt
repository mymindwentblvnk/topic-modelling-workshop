"Stahlmagen" (which is German and means "Steel Stomach") is a six-piece-band from GÃ¶ppingen (South-Germany in the region of Stuttgart) that exists since 2002.
The band is a quite popular underground-act in South-Germany because of their energetic live-performances that include also a lot of funny elements and even more beer. They have already played with bands like "Nocte Obducta". 

The band describes their music as "Metal with a lot of melodies". They use very different elements for their mixture: a lot of melody, midtempo black metal riffing and black metal screams what sometimes remind of bands like "Eisregen", death metal grooves and growls, folkloristic harmonies and also transverse flute and female vocals. But even grindcore-madness, ballads and sing-along refrains can be found.
 
The lyrics are mostly very dark, depressive and melancholic. Some like "A Song About Pieces" are written in English, others like "Schmerz in mir" in German.
But there are also fun-songs like the legendary "Loscher Bier Song", a hymn to the bands favourite brewery.

"Stahlmagen" released their first Demo "Schreie in der Nacht" in 2006.
