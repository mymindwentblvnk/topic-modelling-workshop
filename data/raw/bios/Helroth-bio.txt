The band was formed in December 2012 by three friends - Martha, Zapor and Ernest. Their similar approach towards making music happened to be crucial for the bands unique pagan feel, powerful male vocals, folky melodies, tuneful flute and violin parts, together with complex harmonic guitarwork, and a powerful rhythm section. It's hard to define what genre the band is. It is a particular mixture of ethno/folk, with a shamanic feeling, full of atmospheric melodies and riffs rooted in death- and sometimes even black metal.
