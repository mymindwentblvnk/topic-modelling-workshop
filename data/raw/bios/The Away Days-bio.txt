“The sublime shoegaze riffage of ‘Your Colour’ yearns for the days of Ride and Slowdive, but still sounds like a product of 2014”
-NME Magazine

“Turkish shoegaze might not be a major phenomenon, but given the breadth of their talent, it soon could be.”
-Guardian

“New cut 'Your Colour' matches a blissful, soaring sonic sweep to songwriting with a real dynamism. It's this dichotomy of the physical with the cerebral, the chilled out with the searingly intense which powers The Away Days, taking them away from that well-worn shoegaze sound and into an area very much their own.”
-Clash

''The Away Days project a shimmering, head-swaying spell with lax energy, punchy drums, and lead singer Oguz Can Ozen's affected, distant vocals.''
-SPIN 

‘’The dream-pop band is bringing back 2006 Brooklyn by way of Istanbul.’‘
-NOISEY
