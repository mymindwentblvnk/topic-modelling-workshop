It all started in the band DAMNATION that was formed in 1989. The members were Andreas Spåls (g) Tor Adolfsson (g) and Micke Ahlin (d). Pelle (v) and Markus (b) later joined, but quit in the autumn of 1990. However later the same year Magnus Blomkvist (v) joined. DAMNATION now changed their name to ENCINED, and in the spring of 1991 they recorded a demo called "Funeral rites" with Tomas Skogsberg at the helm. They played some gigs in Sweden, and later that year they went into "Ross recording studio" (Gävle) to set their second demo "Midian" on tape. In early 1992 Jonas Lund joined the band, they played some gigs and make new songs. In the spring of 1992 Micke and Andreas also recorded a demo called "Nee.." with the band SOLILOQUE. In the summer of 1992 Tor decided to leave the band and Daniel Antilla took over. Later the same year even Jonas leaved the band for his other band. In November 1992 the ex DÖD TV-bassplayer Martin Sveden joined ENCINED. In 1993 they played a few live gigs. The song "Compassion" can be found on the compilationtape "Hagarock..93" who was recorded live at the Hagarock festival in 1993. Late 1993 they recorded a rehearsal demo who contained "In Dreamland", "Dead man tell no tales" & "Nothing is forever" but that demo was never official released. In the spring of 1994 ENCINED played a lot of live gigs with their new material, but in August of 1994 the band split.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Encined">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
