Skara Brae was a traditional Irish music group with origins in Rannafast, County Donegal, Ireland. The group consisted of three siblings, Maighread Ní Dhomhnaill, Tríona Ní Dhomhnaill and Mícheál Ó Domhnaill with Dáithí Sproule.
Though brought up in County Meath, the Uí Dhomhnaill siblings had their roots in Rannafast (Rann na Feirste), where their father's family originated. Mícheál and Tríona came together with Dáithí when they went to University College Dublin in the late 1960s. They played gigs around Dublin and Mícheál and Dáithí spent a summer as the house band at Teach Hiúdaí Bhig in Gaoth Dobhair (Gweedore), Donegal. Around 1970, the three siblings -Mícheál, Tríona and Maighréad - teamed up with Dáithi Sproule to form Skara Brae.
Skara Brae produced one album and broke up in 1972, but re-grouped in 1998 and 2003 for concerts in Gweedore, County Donegal. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Skara+Brae">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
