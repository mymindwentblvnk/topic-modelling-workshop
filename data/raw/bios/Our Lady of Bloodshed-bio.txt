Through years of blood, sweat, and beers. Our Lady of Bloodshed have strived to be their absolute best.

After multiple member changes the band has come upon a winning formula. Dedicated musicians who want nothing more than to make their living doing what they love. Metal music, and the metal community are now a way of life for the guys in Our Lady of Bloodshed. Having made so many great friends along the way, how could it not be? Now, with the release of their first full length studio album "VII", the boys will be playing as much as they possibly can to get the word out with plenty of touring in the near future.
