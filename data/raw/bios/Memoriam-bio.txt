Memoriam were formed in January 2016. The band has a substantial and proud Death Metal heritage comprising of:

Karl Willetts - Bolt Thrower
Frank Healy - Benediction, Sacrilege
Andy Whale - Ex Bolt Thrower
Scott Fairfax - Ex Life Denied, Benediction (live)

Memoriam was primarily developed to fill the void that was left following the tragic death of Martin ‘Kiddie’ Kearns, the drummer from Bolt Thrower back in September 2015. Bolt Thrower subsequently placed all activity on hold for the foreseeable future which gave Karl Willetts an opportunity to develop a new project with friends that had expressed interest in forming a band for some time.

Memoriam are an Old School Death Metal band and maintain the standards set by previous bands that the members have played with, focusing on the themes of death, loss and war.

Initially Memoriam got together to play covers of songs that had influenced them throughout their careers within the Death Metal scene, however it soon became apparent that the new songs that they created were of a superior standard.

Memoriam intend to follow tradition by selecting appropriate festivals to play throughout 2016 and 2017. 
Memoriam will be recording the debut album for Nuclear Blast in October 2016.

2016 is the year of Memoriam, a celebration of life through Death Metal.
