We are Holding Steady The Heartbeat Of Hell. 

Hell is the transition from the age of belief into the age of knowledge, as seen by those who encourage ignorance, dependency and servitude. 

We are anti-religion. 
We are anti-economic slavery. 
We are anti-overpopulation. 

When institutions fail, we will have to rely on ourselves.
