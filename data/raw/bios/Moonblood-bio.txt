Moonblood was a black metal band from Schneeberg, Saxony, Germany, formed in 1994. They were previously known as Demoniac.

Demoniac evolved from the death metal band Purulent Obduction (1990-1993) which had members Occulta Mors, Necromaniac and L.O.N.S. Blacksoul (later Gaamalzagoth, real name: Mirko Schmat) joined in mid 1993. In January 1994 Necromaniac and L.O.N.S. had been kicked out and later formed Andras while the remaining members continued as Moonblood after releasing the only Demoniac-demo that was recorded still together in autumn/late 1993 (second demo comes from VHS rehearsal audio rip.).

The band only released vinyls and cassettes, Any CD pressings are bootlegs. Moonblood have recorded over 13 rehearsal tapes that at no time were any official releases and they're only done for the band members to recall their songs since there was never a usual rehearsal possible with one guy playing all instruments and they've only recorded their songs to remember for future studio sessions. A few tapes/recordings might have been spread to friends and due to massive tape trading activities of one of the members but those were the only copies that were spread among the tape trader scene.

Moonblood has split up; however, it is not known when the band actually broke up. Their last demo "Dusk Woerot" was released in 2003. Recorded in September 2000, the band was officially already dead when this recording has been done. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Moonblood">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
