This name refers to more than one artist.

1. GNOME (Japan) is a quite notorious one man Black Metal endeavour of Masanori. A split cassette, 'Story - Legendary Japanese Wolves' shared with NYARLATHOTEP, was issued in 1999 on the Weird Truth Productions label. The music of Gnome has been described as dark nature metal with hysteric extremely high screams, fantasic and intense drivin' melodies/riffs and running bass. 

Masanori had a nocturnal ambient side-project Human Soul,  and a rawer, less melodic black metal project Hurusoma, both of which are now disbanded along with Gnome. Masanori also appeared to have a project named "Woods" although it is not sure what came of this.
