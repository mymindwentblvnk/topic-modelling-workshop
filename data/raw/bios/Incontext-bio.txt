From the East Midlands, UK, hails the drum & bass producer InContext.

Introduced to the art of music from a young age, InContext first embedded his talent into the pop rock band richlife. Touring all over the UK and performing in venues as large as the Ricoh Arena and Plymouth Hoe, richlife have been quite a success. After the high years of richlife, InContext soon turned his interest to producing electronic music, after experimenting with mainly trance and industrial genres, InContext landed on drum & bass in late 2008.

Currently, in 2009, InContext is working hard towards establishing himself well within the drum and bass community, with his track "as the sun goes down" gaining interest from Tony Colman himself and the remix being aired on Radio 1 and 1xtra, you can be sure that InContext is a name you will soon become familiar with.
