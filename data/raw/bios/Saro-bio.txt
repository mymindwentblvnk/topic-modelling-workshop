Expressing your feelings is hard. Just ask Evan, aka Saro, a rising singer who excels in songs that touch your heart deeply with their undeniably exact truths. Akin to embracing his racial androgyny, he eschews genres and instead pursues the perfect form of a sound he can call his own. The result is a dark and trance-like flavor of pop that cuts to the heart but leaves your ears happy at the same time. His perspective is just as valuable as his natural vocal talent, to which he applies a songwriting skill that leaves little room for mis-interpretations. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Saro">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
