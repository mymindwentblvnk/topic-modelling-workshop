3) Dybbuk (from Fort Worth, Texas) came together in the winter of 2001 and did their best to excrete the depressing sludge styles of "Grief" and "Eyehategod", and combine them with the faster metal stylings of bands like "Carcass", "At the Gates" and "Death". The band played 22 shows over a 3 1/2 year period, and were lucky enough to have shared a stage with great bands such as "Solitude Aeturnus", "Floor", "Graves at Sea", "Disrhythmia", "Rune", "League of Struggle", "Garuda", "Yeti", "Kill the Client", "Magnus", "Dead By Dawn", "Summon", "Thornspawn", and others. Dybbuk played their last show on June 25, 2004 at Rubber Gloves Rehearsal Studios in Denton, TX.
