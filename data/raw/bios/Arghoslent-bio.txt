Arghoslent of United States of America (Oakton, Virginia) is a death metal band formed in the summer of 1990. The band's interviews have been the source of much controversy for advocating racism, and lyrically glorifying cultural domination of Africa and the Caribbean by Anglo-Saxon and Spanish conquistadors and slave traders.  Their political ideals do not always reflect the lyrical glorification as they have admitted in interviews that the Trans-Atlantic slave trade was the worst event in American history and that a multicultural land featuring both blacks and whites will never achieve cultural hegemony.  Despite being criticized for their racist/segregationist ideology, Arghoslent has become a popular underground artist (especially after the release of Incorrigible Bigotry), with their albums gathering mostly positive reviews.
