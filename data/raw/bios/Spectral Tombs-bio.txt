Spectral Tombs was a black metal band hailing from Portland, Oregon. The band consists of guitarist Justin Kay, drummer Mark Nunziata (Mass Exit), guitarist/vocalist John Edwards (Resigned to Fate, Dagon, Forever Mourne), and bassist/vocalist Chris Carter (Tsepesch). While primarily described as black metal, their music takes heavily from genres such as crust punk, doom metal, and depressive as well as traditional black metal, culminating in a primal display of anger, hopelessness and crushing despair. The lyrics focus on the madness and pure stupidity of the human race as they stumble on toward an obvious and inevitable self-imposed extinction, taking the rest of all that exists down with them; and the mental anguish caused by the recognition of such facts and a realization that there is no possible way out. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Spectral+Tombs">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
