Winterpain started in the end of the 90's in Groningen, Netherlands. Influenced by bands like Seam, The Notwist, Sophia, The Cure, Motorpsycho and Pinback they started the create their own music and style. In 2000 they recorded their first demo "18 eyes scream" and played shows at Vera, Noorderzon festival and Poppodium Romein. In July 2009 they released their album "With Love". 











It seems there was another band with the same name in the beginning of the 90's; a Metal band from the south of the Netherlands, see second picture. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/winterpain">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
