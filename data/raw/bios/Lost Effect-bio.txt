Lost Effect are a five piece melodic metal band from York.

Formed around January 2008, Lost Effect play a unique style of goth metal with many varied influences. It's hard to describe their sound with instances of straight up metal riffs, clean melodic passages and the odd progressive element, Lost Effect's style can vary and change giving them songwriting flexibility.

At the front they combine the melodic vocals of Emily Burt with the harsh vocal style of keyboardist Dave Wells to switch from melodic to heavy and to intertwine the two. The rest of the band include former Equinox and current Pig Iron drummer Pete Rutherford and Steve Wells and Shaun Wainman.

Lost Effect are currently working on an E.P where they are a fair way into the recording process as well as new material for their live shows. Videos of previous gigs are on their MySpace profile for your enjoyment and there are the rough recordings taken from a band practice session to listen to. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lost+Effect">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
