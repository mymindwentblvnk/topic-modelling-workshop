We are brothers and that's why we know each other well

Hailing from Halle, the two Monkey Safari gents are real Nightlife addicts and indeed lovers of club culture. As owners of the legendary Charles Bronson club and purveyors of labels like What!What! Records (since 2008) & Mambo (since 2011), they truly are ambassadors of house and techno in their hometown.

Happy, silly and fun sounds are the result of their creativity. Their music is tropically flavoured, crossed with an electric spark, ideal for drunken nights out, falling off heels and losing half of your drink to the dance floor. As a DJ team they merrily merge different music genres and styles from all over the globe: sometimes soft and melodic, sometimes deep and conscious, at others down and dirty, but one thing is sure, the mood is always happy. Warning: The wave they're riding is high grade and infectious, this is some serious monkey business! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Monkey+Safari">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
