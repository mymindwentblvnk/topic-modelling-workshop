Inspired by one-man Black Metal bands, Unendlich is the sole creation of multi-instrumentalist Michael Connors. Unendlich’s style retains the chaotic aggression and brutality of black metal tempered with Connors’ signature melodic edge, recalling the halcyon days of extreme metal. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Unendlich">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
