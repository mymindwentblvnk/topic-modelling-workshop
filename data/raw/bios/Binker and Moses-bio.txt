Binker Golding  and Moses Boyd are a semi-free jazz saxophone and drums duo. They are 
among the frontrunners of a loose yet interconnected group of London-based jazz musicians that are influenced by the music that surrounds them, including grime, hip-hop and electronica as well as jazz. Like their US counterparts, they’re connecting with a new, younger audience.

Born either side of the Thames - Binker north in Edmonton, Moses south in Catford – the pair met eight years ago and toured extensively as members of Zara McFarlane’s band, recording three albums for Giles Peterson’s Brownswood Recordings. It was during the onstage sound checks with McFarlane that Binker and Moses started developing their duo improvisations, eventually bringing the idea of recording them to the attention of Gearbox Records, the vinyl-led record label and vinyl mastering studio. 

Their debut album, Dem Ones, kickstarted a sensational period for the duo, earning them a string of awards including Best Jazz Act at the 2015 MOBO Awards and two wins at the Jazz FM Awards 2016: UK Jazz Act of the Year and Breakthrough Act of the Year. They were also voted Jazz Newcomer of the Year at the 2016 Parliamentary Jazz Awards.

From the beginning Binker and Moses have been building a strong young audience base performing in the more intimate rooms away from the traditional jazz venues, such as Brilliant Corners in Dalston and Deptford’s Job Centre as well in bookshops, cafes and record stores. In these situations they can play without amplification, often ‘in the round’ and facing each other, drawing the audience in to their uninterrupted sets that continually ebb and flow, building to tremendously powerful crescendos.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Binker+and+Moses">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
