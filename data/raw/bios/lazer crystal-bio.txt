"Writing about Lazer Crystal's deconstructed electro-pop is like interpreting Rorschach cards while blindfolded. Indeed, the outfit's exhilarating jams are difficult to describe. Spazzy synth chords transmogrify and rhythmic non sequiturs stop, drop, and roll, while deadpan, Ian Curtis-esque vocals modulate over swirling beats and sick drum wizardry. It's a bedazzling mélange of meta dance freak-outs and brainy math-rock technique. With members of local faves Mahjongg, Waterbabies, and Cave, the outfit enjoys a built-in fan base, but their unique sound gets kudos all on its own merits.
