Black/Death Metal band from Singapore City. The band was first known as Rectum. They then changed their name to Leviathan and in 1989 were known as Mumbra. The four members, Supaat (bass), Lukman (drums) and Ashaari (guitars) and Zul (guitars and vocals), recorded and released a rehearsal demo in 1990 named "Mysticism" which had 4 songs. When drummer Lukman left the band they became known as Libation. Rashid joined as the bassist, Supaat shifted to vocals while Zul played drums. In 1990 they finally used the moniker Libation. Some of the members were from a death/thrash metal band called Infidel (released a tape called Flames of Redemption in 1989). In 1992 the band once again changed their name, this time to Itnos and in 1999 they were briefly known as Doxomedon.
