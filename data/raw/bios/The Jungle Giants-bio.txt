The Jungle Giants is an Australian four-piece band that formed in 2011 in Brisbane, Queensland. The band consists of Sam Hales on Vocals/Guitar, Cesira Aitken on Lead Guitar, Andrew Dooris on Bass Guitar/Backing Vocals and Keelan Bijker - Drums/Trombone. 

Their live show makes a bit more sense of their name. With their rhythmic layering and huge indie pop riffs, it’s hard to imagine them performing under any other name.

‘The Jungle Giants’ is the brain child of lead singer Sam Hales who originally arranged the band as a solo project, but soon found that there was more to the group. Landing their debut gig at the Brisbane Powerhouse as part of ‘Livespark’ in late 2010, they impressed crowds with their head bopping and exciting live show. The band spent the summer of 2010 writing and recording their self-titled debut EP that was released in 2011.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Jungle+Giants">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
