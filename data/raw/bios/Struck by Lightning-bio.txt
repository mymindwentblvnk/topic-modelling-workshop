Hailing from Columbus, Ohio, Struck By Lightning formed in 2009, features Gregory Lahm (previously of Mouth Of The Architect) on vocals and guitars, accompanying by Travis Kline, Mike Leach and Thomas Owens (previously of Menorrhagia). Encompassing the aggression and punk slathering of His Hero Is Gone and Disfear with the progressive rock acrobatics of Mastodon and Big Business, Struck By Lightning create ferocious and hairsplitting aggression that will undoubtedly take the world by storm.
