Dyeth; a death/grind outfit from the unknowns of Lion City, Singapore. Bent on fusing sounds of technicality, speed, melody and brutality that lies within each of its members of different music backgrounds. Embracing influence from The Black Dahlia Murder, Cannibal Corpse, Nile and Behemoth, Dyeth has challenged their area of comfort to intensify their style of death/grind. Giving off high levels of energy on stage which borders between feeling high and insanity, they make it look all too natural. Having already played outside of their home country, such as Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia and Batam, Indonesia, Dyeth has already released a self-titled five track EP which songs have been played on live internet radio shows like Full Metal Racket by DJ Stoodge and The Black Rose Indie Metal Hour by DJ DyingSuperNova. Dyeth took the stage as one out of seven audition bands for Baybeats 2013, showcasing their brand of music. The band is currently working on their first full-length LP.
