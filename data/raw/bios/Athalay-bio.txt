The story of Athalaiis (ex-Athalay) started in 1999 with Elvira who established the band that time under the name of Athalay. We started to play symphonic black metal. After some time about 2004 we bacame a strong and well know formation and we started to planning a full lenght studio album after our three earlier records.

 In 2006 we recorded With Hunger for the Forbidden Fruit which kept very good reviews nevertheless the not so good sound quality.

 In 2008 the record session for ...And the Night Comes Again has started. This EP contains 6 track including Summum Ens which got onto the first best of CD of Rockinform, a famous Hungarian rock magazine. We made our first video for the track Prison of a Fey Body which is also included in this EP.

 From 2010 we have to get a two years long break but in 2012 we get back to the life. We changed the name of the band in December 2012 to ATHALAIIS from Athalay and now we are working with three members.
