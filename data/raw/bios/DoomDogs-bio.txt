DOOMDOGS is a stoner/doom/sludge metal band from GÃ¶teborg, Sweden. They play a mid-paced version of slightly uglified stoner doom with crust and doomcore elements. Sort of like mixing Crowbar and a slowed down Kyuss with Neurosis and Cult Of Luna. Due to their tendencies to go all out of stoner, or to simply make experimental twists from time to time, the band doesn't always stay on the "pure" doom metal track.

Members: GG - vocals, Christer - guitars, Patrik - bass, Emil - drums.

Infulences: Black Sabbath, Place Of Skulls, Spirit Caravan, Orange Goblin, Black Label Society, Trouble, Soundgarden, Budgie, Down, Jethro Tull,  Abramis Brama, Metallica. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/DoomDogs">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
