UZUAZO is a rapper based in Montreal, Canada. He dropped his debut album King of Distractions in February 2019. Pulling from themes out of the classic children's tale, The Princess and the Pea, UZUAZO delivers a focused tape full of introspective bangers and dizzying flows. Fully produced, recorded, and written by the 22-year-old talent the full-length comes packed with a standout feature from Chicago lyricist Mick Jenkins.

Speaking to Complex CA via email, UZUAZO spoke candidly about the meaning behind his new effort. "King of Distractions is a personal contemplation about using distractions as a coping mechanism for underlying problems and eventually striving to face the roots of these problems instead of relying on distractions." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Uzuazo">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
