Adfail is a metal band formed in Kaliningrad, Russia in 2007.

The band was founded at one of the regular gothic-parties in Kaliningrad (Koenigsberg) in 2007 and 14/02/2007 is considered to be the band's official "birthday". The first band membership named ASPHODEL came from the pieces of a dark metal project where some of the musicians had been working for about a year before that moment. The prevailing genre of the music is doom-metal though the elements of different genres from gothic to death metal are presented.

"Then we were experimenting with gothic and dark metal, gave some concerts and the staff was shifting dreadfully" (Thorshammer). In a year and a half the band changes its name to ADFAIL ("ruin"), the music becomes harder based on an old school doom metal. "There's no Asphodel, but there's something more now" (Irene). On this impulse the band works till 2011 recording the first album named Unkindness and composing innumerable tracks of genres from gothic rock and sympho to funeral and doom-death metal. "Those who was eager to work held on the band." (Thorshammer) In 2011 a new person is invited to join the staff â€“ a viola player, and he is expected to introduce some variety to the music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Adfail">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
