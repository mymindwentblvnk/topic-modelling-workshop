Naked On The Vague (NOTV)  were born out of discontent with the malady of nothingness. This nothing fuels their stabbing assault of doom laden experimental punk.  

Originally a keys, guitar and drum machine duo (Lucy Cliche - keys/vox/drum box, Nightmare Hopkins - guitar/electronics), NOTV was born out of Sydney, Australia in 2006, with a found organ, a broken bass guitar, a borrowed drum and some old doom poetry. The band recently expanded to include a ‘proper’ rhythm section, with Nic -bass guitar and Lachie - drums. 

Naked On The Vague’s first self titled 7” record was released by Dual Plover. The three song release captures the spectrum of sound NOTV create. Side A features the single ‘All Aboard’, plus the short and sharp ‘God Nor Devil’. These tracks were recorded by the band to four track cassette machine. The B side features a slow doomy track titled ‘A Sunken Piece of Rubbish’, which was recorded while the band was in Los Angeles by Greg Gomberg using a reel to reel tape, with additional recording by the band after the event.

Later NOTV releases include: Chitty Chat (Sacred Bones 2009) 7", The Blood Pressure Sessions (DualPlover 2007/ Siltbreeze 2008) CD/ LP, Mickey Mouse Headache Tapes (Near Tapes 2009) C30 cassette/ CDR, Poltergeist Palm (Skulltones 2008) 7” vinyl, Sad Sun (Sabbatical 2007) CD, Naked On The Vague (Dual Plover 2006) 7” vinyl, and "Heaps of Nothing" (Siltbreeze 2010) - their first album as a band. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Naked+On+The+Vague">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
