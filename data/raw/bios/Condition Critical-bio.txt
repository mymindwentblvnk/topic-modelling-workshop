Condition Critical is a 4 piece thrash band based off members from South, Central, and North Jersey. 

The band was established late 2010 by Alonso, Ryan, and Dave. After a couple of adjustments in the line up with bass players; Mike Dreher joined us forming what the current set line up is today.

"Bred to Kill" 2011 Demo is out now!

More shows, pics, vids, and recordings will be coming very soon!
