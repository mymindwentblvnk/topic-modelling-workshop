History of a one man band called Kanto Arboretum began in year 2010 in Helsinki, Finland. The music of Kanto Arboretum carries a strong black metal influence as it is simplistic, atmospheric and rawish by the sound. Lyrical themes consists of dystopic, misantrophic images as well as nature and environmental views. Even hints of criticism towards capitalism and consumerism can be found from the texts.

The name Kanto Arboretum is derived from an absurd thought: what if there was an arboretum (i.e. botanical collection of trees) where all the wood were cut down, thus allowing to study only tree stumps (Finnish word "kanto" meaning tree stump in English). All in all, Kanto Arboretum makes a perfect name for a band with dystopic music and philosophy.

The first demoalbum "Kevyt on murhe kantaa" was finished at the end of October 2011. Second demoalbum "City of Grass" was finished in November 2012.
