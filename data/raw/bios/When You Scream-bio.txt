Bio
Founded in spring 2010, When You Scream is a relatively young band. Though, they are not exactly trying to move with the rising tide of trends occuring in the modern metal scene. Rather they are playing their own mix of Gothenburg-death metal, combined with toxic black metal-riffs, blast beats and also some grooves and thrash-parts. All that reflects the many different influences of the members.

Originally intended as a solo-project of Chris(guitar), When You Scream grew up in shortest time to a five-piece melodic-death machinery.
In October 2010, the band went to the studio to record a small selection of their songs, and on January the 7th, 2011, the first EP, "Grotesque Fragments Of A Nightmare Scenery" was released and is now ready for you to listen! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/When+You+Scream">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
