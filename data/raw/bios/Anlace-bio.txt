Technical Death Metal band from S.L.P., Mexico from 2003 to 2010.

The band recorded a 4 track demo which was given away in presentations. It is currently unavailable.

In December 2004, Anlace entered the studio of Pablo Rodriguez to record "Anthology of Death (Anthology Part I)" because Anlace was invited to participate in the mexican bands CD "Through the Nation II", which was distributed nation wide from Merida, Yucatan.

After the debut, the band began to play in local venues along with international bands like Gorgoroth, Vader, Hate and Cryptopsy, also touring other cities such as Tampico-Madero, Ciudad Victoria, Tlaxcala, Queretaro, Zacatecas, Rio Verde, among others.

In 2007 Anlace decided to produce a quality CD independently. After acquiring some equipment and doing many tests the band finally achieved the sound it was looking for. In December of the same year the CD "Bleeding Your Hate ", which contains a mixture of old and new tracks, was launched. An important decision was to distribute the album unaffiliated with any record label so the music could be downloaded free from the official band's website.

In January 2009 the recording of the new album "Transmutacion" began. Which was released on May the 15th. Independently as the previous one, . This album consolidates the band's style being more technical than progressive.

Band members: Pepe (drums), Eddie (guitar), Odin (voice), Benom (bass), Vorph (guitar).
