In 2005 after being friends and associated production whores with Mikah Freeman, Vance Musgrove & Ross McGrath started their digital label project, dubbed The Aston Shuffle. What started off as a group effort to get their previously unreleased tunes to the masses has skyrocketed into 2007 with the group heavily in demand for their white hot remixes – a little electro, a little techno, but all house. When the swing on their tunes hits the dance floor you’ll be more than pleasantly surprised how hard it is keep your body from going retarded.

In 2008, Ross McGrath left the group to focus on other projects. Vance and Mikah have continued the group and since released a new single, "Stomp Yo Shoes". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Aston+Shuffle">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
