Last Seen Wearing are a genre-defiant act comprised of four freaks from faraway lands, brought together by a mutual interest in cannibalism & stamp-collecting, they pioneered the world's first postage stamp made entirely of human foreskins...then ate it. They sound like a rhinocerous being bludgeoned to death with a jet engine (whatever the fuck that means), and they taste, smell & feel like a well matured stilton. When not participating in clinical trials they're out there, infecting minds with their fetid brew of aural filth. Find them...watch them...give them money!! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/last+seen+wearing">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
