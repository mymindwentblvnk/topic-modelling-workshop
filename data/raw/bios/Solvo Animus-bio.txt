On December 2008 Raly Vega contacted Dennis Torres to form a new band - with Luis Vila from Sacrilegio - merging sounds of classic, speed and progressive metal. In one month and a half, 10 tracks (including a version of famous Johann Pachelbel's "Canon In D") were created and recorded. The whole album is available for purchase as an MP3 download on Amazon, ITunes and other well known MP3 sellers throughout the Internet.
The band objective is to continue creating music for years to come.
Currently, the band is searching for a drummer for live performances. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Solvo+Animus">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
