Vapnet is an indie band from Östersund, Sweden. 
The band started when the lyricist, Martin Abrahamsson, wrote the song "Ge dom våld". The song didn't fit in with Sibiria, the band where Martin Abrahamsson used to play. So, together with the singer from Sibiria, Martin Hanberg,  he started the band Vapnet.

Other members are Anna Modin, Per-Olof Stjernered, Jesper Hedin and David Nygård. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vapnet">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
