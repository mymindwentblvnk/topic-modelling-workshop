Hello there! 
We may have met before... We are Nosoyo, a group of young musicians from Amsterdam.
The past two years we’ve been strolling through the Netherlands and Germany, writing, performing and recording our music. During that time we found ourselves playing at chique factories, classy theatres, shabby night clubs, fiery festivals and somehow ended up recording our album in a German bunker with some amazingly talented people.
You can listen to our firstborn „Just before the faint“ on www.soundcloud.com/nosoyo or buy an actual copy by sending an e-mail to info@nosoyo.net. The artwork was made by Joost Stokhof (The Things We Are). Enjoy the record! 

Love, Nosoyo
