MINCE GRINDCORE band started in 2002 in the south of Austria. They first idea was to play an old-school grindcore like early Napalm Death, Fear Of God or Agathocles with Discharge influences too. But nowadays their high technical level and good sound quality, become "Bastard Peels" as a grindcore band with thrash and metal influences too. They have recorded with different labels but have an special friendship with the anarchist label "Ecocentric Records".
