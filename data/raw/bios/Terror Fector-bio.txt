Terror Fector were a thrash metal band from the cities of Nagasaki and Tokyo, Japan. They formed in 1988 and released their first demo tape in 1990, entitled 'Curse Of Eternity'. A year later, 'Slaughter to Survive' followed. In 1993, they appeared on two compilation CD's: 'To The Marrow ~Japanese Deathnology' (released on Toy's Factory Records, w/ Hellchild, Eroded, Transgressor, The Equinox, Maggoty Corpse, Voidd, Multiplex and Satanic Hell Slaughter) and on 'Deadly Sins' (released on MCR Records, w/ Eroded, Maggoty Corpse, Beyond Description, Voidd, Incrimination and Gabish). In 1994, the band released their first full-length album, 'Everlasting Hell Damnation', on Howling Bull Records. In 1995, they released another, untitled, demo tape and eventually they split up.
