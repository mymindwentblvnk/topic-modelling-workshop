The Polish band (Krakow) Sothoth was established early in 2002. Nowadays the band consist of : Adam Pieczarkowski - drums, Grzegorz Piszczek – all vocals, Mateusz Niedzwiecki – guitar, Daniel Kesler – guitar and Damian Gorczyca – bass.

First demo recorded back in September 2003 was received very well in metal underground reviews. Second contact with a studio took place in July 2004 when Sothoth recorded their second demo – but due to the low quality of recorded material it simply wasn’t promoted. In a meantime the band was playing a lot of concerts in Poland and was making material for their first long play. In march 2006 Sothoth started recording tracks on their first album”From deformity till Homicide” in Olkusz’s ZED Studio with Tom Zalewski as a producer.During 2006 holidays the major guitarist Leszek Gularek who played with Sothoth from his beginning left the band, but very soon after that we found Daniel Kesler from death metal band Redemptor who changed Leszek.
