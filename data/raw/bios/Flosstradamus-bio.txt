Flosstradamus is Chicago DJ and musician Curt Cameruci (aka Dj Autobot). From 2007 until 2016, Flosstradamus consisted of Cameruci and Josh Young (aka J2K and YehMe2), also from Chicago. The duo announced they would both be pursuing solo careers, with Cameruci to continue using Flosstradamus as a stage name. Flosstradamus is known for being one of the early pioneers of the trap genre, made popular by their remix of Major Lazer's hit single "Original Don".

They gained popularity building mashups out of well known songs, while maintaining a consistent dance flow, making them dance hall masters and quick local favorites.  

As a duo they have worked alongside artists including Kid Sister (Young's sister), Diplo, Three 6 Mafia's Juicy J, The Cool Kids, and A-Trak.

On July 29, 2016, they released their single 'Came Up' with FKi 1st, graves and featuring Post Malone and Key!. In December 2016, Young announced Flosstradamus were splitting and he will pursue a solo career. Young's solo project soon adopted the name YehMe2. Cameruci will continue with the name Flosstradamus as a solo act. In March 2017 he released the single "Back Again", which featured Waka Flocka Flame and Mayhem through Ultra Music. They have also partnered with Dillon Francis to form the touring and live performance group Dillstradamus. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Flosstradamus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
