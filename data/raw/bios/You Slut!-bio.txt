You Slut! was a Derby/Nottingham (UK) instrumental math-rock experimental 4-piece, formed in 2004.

On September 23rd 2014 the band's 10th anniversary, You Slut! announced that they would no longer continue the project.

Initially a tongue-in-cheek reaction to their indie-schmindie roots, You Slut! have found favour with those who concern themselves with the more interesting side of rock music. Drawing comparisons to contemporaries And So I Watch You From Afar & Adebisi Shank as well as more established artists in the order of Don Caballero, The Fucking Champs and Hella, You Slut! deal in instrumental music that rarely finds itself drifting into the cliche-ridden Post-Rock world of meandering soundscapes and long build ups, instead aiming arrows of riff-driven, tempo-twisting, rhythm-riding adrenaline into the heart of their sound.
 
A 2005 6-track EP 'Grit Eyed & Greasy Tailed' was followed with the release of 8-track album 'Critical Meat' in Japan (Xtal Records) in 2007 and the UK (StressedSumo Records) in 2008.
