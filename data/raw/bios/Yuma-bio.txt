Yuma, one of the IRMAâ€™s brightest hopes in 2008. Having learned his piano skill since his early childhood, this twenty three year old Japanese producer based in the U.S. specializes producing tracks with his extraordinary musical sense and dynamic sound production that comes from his youthful ebullience. While working for IRMA, he is still a student of musical college in Wisconsin, USA and is 23 years old, the true next generation. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Yuma">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
