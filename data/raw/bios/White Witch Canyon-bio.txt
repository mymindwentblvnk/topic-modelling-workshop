Ex-Greenhouse Effect singer/guitarist Eric “Lando” Hagen formed White Witch Canyon in ’07 and released their self-titled debut in ’08. From the way the stun-guitar of “The Witch” kicks in, it doesn't leave much doubt that White Witch Canyon are anything but unexpurgated Stoner Rock. There’s no “Post” anything here – it’s overloaded low-end, pedal-powered distortion in both riff and solo and Lando waxing prolific on getting high with witches, androids and broke-down starships. It’s no-think heavy rock n’ roll that doesn’t pretend to be anything else.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/White+Witch+Canyon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
