Tupper Ware Remix Party (often abbreviated as TWRP; pronounced "twerp") is a Canadian rock band originally from Halifax, Nova Scotia. Their lineup consists of keyboardist and vocalist Doctor Sung, guitarist Lord Phobos, bassist Commander Meouch, and drummer Havve Hogan.

The band always performs in full costume, with their faces and real names unknown; they also have a unique band history, involving Doctor Sung finding his bandmates through space and time.[1][2] As of February 2022, TWRP have released four full-length albums and seven EPs.

They are also known for their collaborations with Ninja Sex Party, having become their opening act and backing band in 2015 on both live performances and studio releases, starting with the album Under the Covers.[3] They are also the backing band on The TryForce, the third album of Starbomb, another band featuring the members of Ninja Sex Party.[4]

Initially founded in 2007 in Halifax, Nova Scotia,[1] the band moved to Toronto in 2014 with a change in members and musical direction. In November 2018, the band announced plans to relocate to Los Angeles, California to focus on US tours, though they would remain based in Canada as Canadian citizens.[5][6] <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/TWRP">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
