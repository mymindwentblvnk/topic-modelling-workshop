New York bred, Los Angeles based house and techno DJ. NYCPARTYINFO and vocalist/collaborator with releases on Bromance, Hot Creations, Suruba, Throne of Blood and Lo:Rise/Defected.

Raised in an atmosphere bursting with passion for music, LOUISAHHH!!! (born Louisa Pillot) started singing and playing instruments at an early age before discovering a passion for DJing. Starting at age 17, sneaking into New York City clubs with fake IDs, LOUISAHHH!!! (a name chosen 'as a war cry or a shriek of delight') has since honed a style that is hard but deep, tough but tender. 

After moving to Los Angeles in 2006, LOUISAHHH!!! became half of house-centric production duo NYCPARTYINFO, releasing records with Throne of Blood, Nurvous and Young Adults. However, it wasn't until friend Danny Daze requested some vocals for his group Senor Stereo that LOUISAHHH!!!'s talents as a singer began to shine, gaining more notoriety as modern classic 'Your Everything' climbed the deep house charts. 

Amidst this whirlwind of excitement, a fateful meeting of French techno wonderkind, Brodinski spiraled into a fast friendship and eventual collaboration for Brodinski's young label, Bromance Records. With 'Let the Beat Control Your Body' and 'Nobody Rules the Streets' becoming peak-time anthems, and explosive vocal collaborations in the realms of both deep house and new techno, LOUISAHHH!!! was getting ready to release her own productions into the world. 

2013 brings about LOUISAHHH!!!'s first serious solo EP on Bromance records. Supported by dynamic, emotional, ferocious DJ sets rife with technical finesse, LOUISAHHH!!! maintains that 'she is thrilled to be alive', and that her music is an active expression of this. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Louisahhh%21%21%21">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
