Arete was an alternative rock band that existed from 1988 through 1990, based in Connecticut, USA.  The band consisted of Tom Stepkoski (vocals, guitar, bass), Jeff Steblea (vocals, bass, guitar), Brian Ayles (guitar, vocals), and Dave Hamilton (drums).  Stylistically, the band borrowed from a diverse array of alternative and new wave bands, including The Cure, The Police, R.E.M., The Smiths, New Order, U2, The Replacements, the Ramones, and the Pixies, as well as fellow Connecticut rockers like Those Melvins, The Gravel Pit, and Miracle Legion.  Arete released two cassette-only EPs -- 1989's Carpe Diem and 1990's For Unlawful Common Knowledge -- before disbanding in 1990.   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Arete">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
