"Chrome Children" is a joint project between [adult swim] and Stones Throw records. After years of using the music of Stones Throw artists like Madlib, Oh No and J Dilla in our bumps and packaging, we decided to take our partnership a bit further. The result? "Chrome Children"- 19 songs deep, a year in the making, it features all new music from each member of the Stones Throw roster.

Also packaged with the album is a DVD with an hour long documentary featuring live performances by Egon, M.E.D., Peanut Butter Wolf, J Rocc, Oh No and Roc C, Percee P, Madlib, and Madvillain. The documentary was shot by us, your favorite [adult swim] crew, at this year's South By Southwest music festival. We also threw a few of our "cards" in there to make it feel like home.

First we brought you Dangerdoom,
then Chocolate Swim,
and now, "Chrome Children."
