Panopticum is a progressive rock/metal band from Ypres, in Belgium. It was founded in 1997 as a highschool-trio, each one of them determined to become a better musician.

They have released one demo and two full cd's "Reflection" and "rights of the firstborn", available on their website http://panopticum.org 

The challenging aspect of playing and composing progressive music, typically attracts skilled musicians. However, the thing that really brought Panopticum to it's current line-up, is a combination of coincidence, though decisions, and friendship.

All band members started off playing classical music at 10 years old. Most of them continued studying their instruments, and graduated. In their professional lives, they're musicians, studying, teaching, mixing and playing music during most of the time. Besides Panopticum, everyone has other musical environments, bands, and activities.

What actually is progressive rock? Much discussion is going on, but for sure, it is defenitively not copying Genesis from the 70's.

Typical elements in progressive are: extended songs with rich harmony, shifting time signatures, evolving musical themes, virtuosity and improvisation.

Just a few examples of superb bands that have made a massive impact on the 'Prog' scene: Dream Theater, Genesis, Rush, Toto, Spock's Beard, Transatlantic, ... 

The band doesn't exist anymore.
