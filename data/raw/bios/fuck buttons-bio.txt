Fuck Buttons are Andrew Hung and Benjamin John Power, a two-piece experimental group based in London, England, UK.

Formed in late 2004 and signed to ATP Recordings, releasing the Bright Tomorrow b/w "Little Bloody Shoulder" 7" single during the fall of 2007. They released their first album Street Horrrsing in 2008 and received widespread acclaim. 

Their second album Tarot Sport was released in 2009. "The album Tarot Sport is one of unbound possibility and lucid cohesion; a cerebral pilgrimage that refines, crafts, explores and develops the experimental aesthetic of last year’s critically acclaimed debut Street Horrrsing." ATP

The duo’s pioneering sound drew legendary DJ, producer and remixer Andrew Weatherall into the story - his own unique ethos inspired him to return behind the desk at the Rotters Golf Club Studio in London to capture a snapshot of two artists pushing forward into uncharted territories. As the band says, “There are so many more layers of sound that we needed somebody with the ability to spread these out over a wide plane… The ambition of sound in this record required him to realise it.” 

All of Fuck Buttons' design work is created by the band themselves, Andrew makes the videos whilst Benjamin designs the record sleeves – embellishing one cohesive identity throughout their output.

The band's third album Slow Focus was released in 2013.
