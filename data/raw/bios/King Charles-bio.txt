King Charles is a singer-songwriter whose sound has been described as everything from psychedelic rock to folk-pop. Born and raised in London, Charles fell in love with country music, took up the guitar, and was writing his own music by the age of 17.

Following a year at Durham University, Charles returned to London in 2007 without a degree but with the new moniker 'King Charles'. He formed a band, Adventure Playground, who along with other like-minded souls, made West London's Bosunâ€™s Locker their base. Adventure Playground went on to tour with Laura Marling and Noah and The Whale, but disbanded in 2008.

Since launching his solo debut single, Time of Eternity in 2010, King Charles has garnered much press and online support along with radio play from UK radio djs Tom Robinson, Rob Da Bank, Zane Lowe, Lauren Laverne and Huw Stephens. 

In early 2010, King Charles won the prestigious International Songwriting Competition by a unanimous vote by a panel of industry heavyweights including Tom Waits, Kings of Leon, Timbaland,Black Francis and Jerry Lee Lewis. Since then, he has been performing to critical acclaim throughout the UK and Europe, gathering an ever-swelling and devout audience. He most recently supported Mumford & Sons on their sold-out US tour in late 2010.  

Having just signed a global deal in the US with Universal Republic in partnership with his UK independent label, Mi7 Records, King Charles is currently recording his debut album to be released in the 7th May 2012.

The album was released to critical acclaim, but with little buzz in the public eye. He has been writing new material, and previewed this supporting Panic! At The Disco on their European tour. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/King+Charles">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
