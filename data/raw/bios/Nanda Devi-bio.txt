Nanda Devi is:
Aaron Schomaker
Ryan Whyte
Tony Komforty
Brandon Gordon

Made up of ex and current members of Hellas Mounds, Marmora, Cadenza, Altar of Earth, Withering, Apparitia, ETC. Nanda Devi is taking "post" music to new heights by creating their own crushing, yet emotion-soaked blend of multiple genres that is sure grip it's listeners. Not even two years after forming (started in September, 2007) the band has months of North American touring under their belt, three released albums, and plans for more touring of the US and Europe in 2010.

Look out for an upcoming split with Across Tundras followed by a yet unnamed full length.
