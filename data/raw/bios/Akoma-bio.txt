AKOMA is a female fronted, symphonic metal band from Denmark, formed in the late autumn of 2004 by vocalist, Tanya Bell and guitarist, Morten Harboe.

AKOMA released their first EP, Angels of Revenge in February 2006, which were recorded, mixed and produced by the band themselves.

The next period of time was marked by several changes in the line-up. February 2006, Daniel Nielsen joined the band, and soon after Peter Buur.

After a couple of concerts and a lot of rehearsal, AKOMA went to the studio to record their new promo, Lost Forest.

The 3 tracked promo was, recorded and produced, once again by the band themselves at a small studio in their hometown Silkeborg, but the mix was this time, done by Jacob Hansen at Jacob Hansens Studios (DK).

In 2007, AKOMA is going to contribute with 2 songs for a new Danish horror movie, Rovdrift (www.rovdrift.dk). Here will the songs, Lost Forest and Guardian Angel (previous released on, Angels of Revenge) be used.

In late 2011, AKOMA announced that they were enetering the studio to record a new EP entitled The Other Side. The new EP is expected to be released in early 2012.
