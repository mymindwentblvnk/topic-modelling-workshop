5 piece brutal thrash metal band from Brisbane, Australia. Having recently released "The Last Testament" EP and returning from a successful promotional tour the band is in the studio again nearing completion on their upcoming album, scheduled for an early 2012 release.
Inspired by the greats of the thrash and metal realm, and also from much more varied musical tastes outside the metal genre, the band is constantly striving to better their songwriting abilites, both individually and as a unit.
Incorporating blistering speed riffage, devil-dance grooves, unpredictable tempo changes and lightning fret work, Bane Of Bedlam have been rehearsing 5 nights a week for the past 2 years to create a massive sound that is truly their own. They write the music they want to hear, and deliver it with machine like crushing precision in the live field.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bane+of+Bedlam">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
