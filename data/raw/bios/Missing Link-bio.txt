Three bands with this name:

1. This early 70’s jazz-rock band from Munich has had a rather short career; in fact, it lasted the space of an album called “Nevergreen”, released in 1972. Then the band broke up, most of their members scatttering about in various directions. They consisted of guitarist Markus Sing, soprano and alto sax player Gunther Latuschik, bassist Dave Schratzenstaller, vocalist Gabriel Dominik Mueller, future SAHARA drummer Holger Brandt, and keyboard player Dieter Miekautsch who would later join MISSUS BEASTLY and then EMBRYO.

They played typical 70's German progressive jazz rock in the style of THIRSTY MOON, early EMBRYO and KRAAN. Almost each of their album’s seven tracks seems to explore a different genre, at times centering around some jazzy sax riffs, at times surprising the listener with a quiet piano solo; or else venturing into loud, heavy rock outbursts mixed with acoustic guitar. The overall feel is quite jazzy and what stands out most is the interplay between guitar, sax and keyboards.
Should appeal to fans of EMBRYO and THIRSTY MOON as well as to some ARDO DOMBEC and XHOL fans.


2. Missing Link is a Danish Heavy Metal band, formed in 1988.
