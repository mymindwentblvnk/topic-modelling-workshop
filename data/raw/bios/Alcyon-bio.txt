The project´s name is derived from the latin synonym for the kingfisher bird. It hints at what the work of Carsten Büttemeier is about.

The solo project Alcyon was started in the late 90s and its works are almost completely created using computer technology. Since then a set of ambitious ambient tracks were created, which also formed the basis for contacts to several internet communities. Through this means of communication Alcyon´s works could find their way to his enthusiastic audience. The first release Nebelbank EP, released on tonAtom, is a selection of some of the best works from this period.

For the future there are plans for other EP releases on tonAtom and a full length album is currently being worked on. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Alcyon">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
