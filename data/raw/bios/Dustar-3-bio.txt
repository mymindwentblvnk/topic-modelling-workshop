The line-up of Dustar-3 is a mix from two bands. Noisy (bassist) and Himawari (drums) are from the band Sex Machineguns. Yuki is from the band Λucifer and plays the guitar.

The trio takes their turns in singing, everyone gets a chance to show their 'singing talents' at their best, but mainly it’s Noisy on vocals.

The three play a catchy mix between old-school punk and metal, although you might also find some bluesy influences once in a while. Another one of their special features are their lyrics, which are about very ‘interesting’ subjects like the song ‘Toilet Paper’.

To make a long story short, this crazy trio makes some great music and you should definitely check them out! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/DUSTAR-3">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
