Exposé is an American girl group from Miami, Florida formed in 1984 and consists of Jeanette Jurado, Gioia Bruno, and Ann Curless. 
Exposé was initially formed in 1984 when Lewis Martineé, a Miami disc jockey and producer, decided to form a dance-based group. He also wrote and produced all songs on their first two albums, Exposure (1987) and What You Don't Know (1989). He also contributed to the group's third effort, Exposé, in 1992.
During the recording of the group's first studio album Exposure, the personnel of the group changed.
In March 1987, the new lineup of Exposé released its debut album Exposure on Arista Records, led by the pop/dance hit "Come Go with Me" which reached #5 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. During the summer of 1987, a re-recorded version of "Point of No Return" was released, with Jurado now performing lead vocals, and it too topped out at #5 on the US Hot 100.
Their most successful period was from 1986 until 1995 when they were dropped from Arista Records. They were inactive from 1996 until 2003 when they performed a reunion concert and soon after performed full time.
Billboard magazine named the group the 8th most-successful girl group of all-time based on charts.
