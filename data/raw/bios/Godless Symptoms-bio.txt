The frontman is Baruz, after splitting from his early band called Balcony (a hardcore legend from Bandung on late 90's scene), he gathered a few dude including his little brother to form a band called Godless Symptoms. Many guys come and go since the band started, and finally after the sophomore album and today's formation; Baruz on vocal, Diki on guitar, Goestie on drums, Tommy on guitar and Andry 'Joe' Novaliano on bass , the band going stronger, tighter and solid than ever.
