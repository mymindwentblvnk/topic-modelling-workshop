There are three bands called "The Age"

1) The Age (formerly known as Second Age) was a polish hardcore/punk band from Wroclaw. They've relased one 7" EP on dutch hardcore label Commitment Records ( http://www.myspace.com/commitmentrecords ) in 2003 and then split up. 

2) An electric rock n' roll band from Halifax, NS.

2)The AGE from Northumberland, England - a bunch of wild psychedelic space rock punks! Also known as The Ancient Garden of Earth and formerly called The New Age. 

Northumbria's The Age were a frequent live performing group playing in the British underground of free festivals and New Age travelling gigs; maybe as they say in Japan and the USA - a Jam Band. They also played for The Greenhouse (Dan Driscoll) at Glastonbury, for Company Piedo (Christina Sears) and the Golden Moon Stage. They teamed up with cult writer Colin Wilson for the track 'Higher'. Mysticism, paganism, alternative politics, green thinking, and shamanistic motifs appear in many of the songs, alongside a unique sense of humour!

The Long Pigs declared “THE AGE” to be the best live band they’d ever seen and the band’s built a growing reputation for songs with the sort of catches you simply can’t ignore or forget.
The Northumbrian/Nottingham four-piece have a huge stash of quality groove anthems ready to go. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Age">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
