Parabola is a four piece Rock band from Dimitrovgrad, Bulgaria who's influences are drawn from the bands of the nineties with a contemporary twist.

Parabola was created in the nineties and originally was performing covers of the then contemporary bands like Stone Temple Pilots, Alice in Chains, Silverchair, Red Hot Chili Peppers and even Rage Against The Machine (with the help of Anton Anestiev on vocals). Slowly they started developing their own style and wrote some original songs trying to incorporate their influences from the nineties with newer and more "modern" sounding bands like Incubus, 3 Doors Down, Nickelback...
 Eventually at the beginning of the twenty first century the band stopped performing as two of it's members emigrated abroad and Parabola became a studio project. Once every couple years the boys get together to write and record their new ideas.
 All of Parabola's recordings to date were recorded and engineered by Chavdar Dimitvov and his brother Svetozar at their private studio.
