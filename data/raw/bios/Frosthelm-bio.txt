Hailing from the frozen plains of North Dakota, Frosthelm has contrived a vile brew of blackened plague-infused battle thrash. Frosthelm's debut EP "The Northwinds Rend Flesh" is abundant with punishingly memorable riffs, head banging rhythms, and soul-chilling savagery. 

Formed in 2009, Frosthelm has thus far released a demo entitled "Icecrown" (2010) and an EP "The Northwinds Rend Flesh" (2012) with much acclaim. Frosthelm has been steadily gaining momentum in local metal scenes. Frosthelm also made an appearance in TERRORIZER magazine's September 2012 issue and on the "Fear Candy" CD compilation series. They plan to continue writing a full length record, play shows, and infect the masses one by one, until all are under the banner of the mighty Frosthelm.
