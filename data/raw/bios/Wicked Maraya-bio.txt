Founding members and brothers John Iadevaio, Michael Iadevaio, childhood friend FALCO, cousin Dan Malsch along with good friend Mike Nack are the force behind Wicked Maraya's music. Their live performance thrives on dynamics, attitude, and building tension by raising and lowering intensity levels, then climaxing with a unique burst of power.


After signing with Mausoleum Records, November 1993, Wicked Maraya recorded their debut CD 'Cycles' in California, Florida, Schuren and Morfelden (Frankfurt), Germany. Produced by Legendary Metal Producer - Jim Morris, this debut CD is a moody, melodic, precisely crafted album. In April 1994 'Cycles' was released in the European market. Wicked Maraya then embarked on a highly successful tour of Europe opening for METAL CHURCH. The tour netted them a citation for 'Concert Of The Month' in Koln, Germany. 'Cycles' hit 1 on German Album Rock Radio charts, and received major acclaim in such prestigious European magazines as Aardschok and RockHard, where Wicked Maraya was voted 8 Best Newcomer of 1994 in their March 1995 READERS POLL of 298 acts. The video for the single 'Another Day' was released nationally on Warner Bros. Rock Video Monthly, as well as getting major airplay on Europe's VIVA Television. Following the July 1994 U.S. release, Wicked Maraya went on three consecutive cross country tours - As a Co-Headliner with Chicago's Cyclone Temple and as support for Dee Snider's Widowmaker and also Guitar Maestro Yngwie Malmsteen.
