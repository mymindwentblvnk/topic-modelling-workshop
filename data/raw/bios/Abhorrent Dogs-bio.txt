Abhorrent Dogs is a black metal side project created by Kasey Apollo. Each album is a conceptual story about a werewolf, often romantically involved. The music is almost meant to be theatrical, using a mix of symphonic elements along with sound effects to help create a movie-like feeling. Started in St Louis, Missouri in April of 2016, Abhorrent Dogs was originally created for a school project, but Kasey quickly grew attached to it and decided to expand it. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Abhorrent+Dogs">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
