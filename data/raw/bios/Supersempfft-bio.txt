Supersempfft, a.k.a. Roboterwerke, were a German electronic duo active from the late 1970s to early 1980s. The duo consisted of Dieter Kolb and Franz Aumüller. Although they emerged in the era of Neue Deutsche Welle, their sound had more in common with Italo Disco and the Kosmische electronics of mid-1970s Krautrock. As Supersempfft they released the albums "Roboterwerke" (1979) and "Metaluna" (1981), and as Roboterwerke they released the album "Futurist" (1981). Kolb and Aumüller were also half of the group 4D.
