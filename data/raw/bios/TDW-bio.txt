Listening to TDW is the musical equivalent to brain dissective surgery. You (as a listener) are able to look inside the creator’s mind by listening to the music…

…okay, this probably did not give you any insight into what TDW is huh? Let’s start again then:

TDW is the name under which Tom de Wit releases self-written and produced music. He is a composer, singer and multi-instrumentalist whose music can be described as a blend of 70′s Prog, Symphonic Rock and Year ’00 Metal. The lyrics mostly center around the human psyche and emotions. Big themes as life and death are tackled but also themes like politics and social issues are touched upon.

From the very first record First Draft that was released on a small scale in 2004 up until the mammoth two-disc Scrapbook release from 2011, TDW’s music has been an ever-evolving and challenging musical journey. Metallic and Aggressive sounds on one side are combined with Melodic and Sensitive sounds on the other.

TDW is project-based and therefore it does not really start or end anywhere. All sorts of music can be released under the TDW name without boundaries. The shape of it is however evolving and changing with each step. There are no rules to what is and what isn’t suitable. In the end the music will always resonate with one quote:
