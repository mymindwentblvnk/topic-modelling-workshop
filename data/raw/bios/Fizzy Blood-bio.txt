Fizzy Blood are 4 good friends who came together to make music in 2014 through a shared incompetence in the modern workplace. Based out of Leeds they combine retro-inspired rock, blistering riffs and a modern songwriting ethos to create something that stands apart from the current trend of rock music.

Although they first met at school in a small Midlands city, it took years of various musical endeavours before the boys found themselves together in Leeds.

Despite being together for a few months, they've toured the UK twice, earned an invitation to play Download Festival and are premiering their debut single January Sun, recorded live to tape at Greenmount Studios, on BBC Radio One.

Now older and more experienced (but none the wiser) Fizzy Blood are poised to make an impact. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fizzy+Blood">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
