Similar to pregnancy, LachrymAnopsia is a slowly simmering emotional process which by the 9th month usually gives birth to an innovative musical “architexture”.
Aiming musically on authenticity, maturation and emotion; with lyrics smeared with questionings about society, norms, life and man in general; the project explores the musical realm while objecting to position itself, determined to shift constantly and never fix itself inside the limits of a single category. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/LachrymAnopsia">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
