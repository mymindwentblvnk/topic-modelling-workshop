Founded in 2008 by Fjoer, it originally started out as a one-man project. But vocals where needed and Haetspuijerij was found. After that, plans of making black metal were taking shape. With Perkuno on the bass and Deadsangst on the drums they completed the line-up for Dodenrijk. Deadsangst and Haetspuijerij left Dodenrijk a short while ago due to personal reasons, Fjoer and Perkuno are taking over all instruments and new songs will be written soon
