Le Flex first started his music project to attract as many groupies as possible. Instead, all he gets are DJs messaging him to collaborate on their half-finished ideas. His world-conquering remix of Kilo Kish - ‘Curious’ for Maison Kitsuné set him on the road to stardom and he now spends much of his time tinkering with a time machine to get back to the 80’s. In between this he writes and produces sublime synth pop to make you dance, and ballads to tempt your inner lover. With 26 million YouTube streams and counting it seems the suffering will continue. Allow him to assault your ears with a collection of songs that would sour any dinner party. After being lovingly crafted in his spare time away from his main job as a gigolo in the south of France, the Le Flex discography is now available to earn him pence on streaming services. His new album FLEXUALITY is rumoured to cure the Coronavirus when listened to. Still no word on the groupies. Le Flex loves sunshine, Whisky, and looking under his bed.
