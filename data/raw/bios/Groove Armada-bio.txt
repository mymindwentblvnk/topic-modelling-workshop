Groove Armada is an electronic music group from Cambridge, United Kingdom, composed of two members, Andy Cato (real name Andrew Cocup) and Tom Findlay. They first came to fame with a 1997 limited single release, At the River (made famous after being used in various Marks & Spencer advertisements), which sampled "Old Cape Cod" by Patti Page. The song has since made its way onto numerous chill-out compilations.

Their most famous work is the 2000 international hit I See You Baby, remixed by Fatboy Slim in the Big Beat style -- with the repeated chorus line "Shakin' that ass," as heard in Renault MÃ©gane advertisements. Vocals were provided by Ibiza-based DJ Gram'Ma Funk. Incidentally, this track was also recorded with the chorus line "Shakin' that thang" as a radio edit. While this is their most famous work, they have also produced less mainstream songs which are often featured in television adverts.

In the early part-of 2008 after parting company with Sony BMG, Groove Armada signed an "all encompassing deal" with the Bacardi rum brand that allows them to use GA's tracks for adverts.  For more information, read Bands turn to brands in new deals
