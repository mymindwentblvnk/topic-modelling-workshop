Own release

“We are aware of the fact that we are not the most original band around. Our MCD will not change the face of music as we know it.”

This statement feels like a breeze of fresh air in a time where every starting band tries to convince reviewers that they are the hardest working band ever and that they deserve to be the next big thing. All Disnight ask you to do is “listen to our music and keep an eye on us in the future.”

Now that’s what I call a reality check. These guys from Belgium know that they’re nowhere near the big league. However, they released an MCD with four metalcore songs to be heard by anyone who is interested. Like they say, it’s not original at all, but it’s not bad either. Actually, it’s pretty good for a first recording experience. The guitar parts are tight and catchy. These guys know how to play, so maybe the next release will bring us some more original material. The only thing you could argue about is the vocals of singer Maarten. You either like them or you don’t. So if you want to check out this new metalcoreband, go and visit their MySpace page.

And I promise I’ll keep an eye on Disnight in the future.
