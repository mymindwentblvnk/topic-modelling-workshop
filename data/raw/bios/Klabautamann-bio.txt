Klabautamann is a German Atmospheric Metal band, with black and progressive influence. The band themselves have claimed that they will not limit themselves to a certain style of music, but it will always be nature-related in some way.

Klabautamann is a medium for the musical expression of Tim Steffens and Florian Toyka, who formed the band in 1998.

After two demo-recordings the band finished their debut album "Our Journey Through the Woods" in summer 2003. This was archived with the help of Marlon Drescher (session drums) and Armin Rave (mix and mastering). In February 2005 the second album "Der Ort" has been released on Heavy Horses Records. This time the CD was completely produced by the band. There were again some other people involved: Patrick Schr√∂der (session drums), Isabel Jasse + Stefan Horn (guest vocals), Julia Tomaschitz + Christian Kolf (some lyrics). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Klabautamann">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
