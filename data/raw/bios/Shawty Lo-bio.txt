Shawty Lo (1976-2016), was an American rapper, producer, member of the hip hop group D4L and CEO of D4L Records Inc. Hailing from Bankhead in Atlanta, Georgia, Shawty Lo released his debut album, Units in the City, in 2008 which featured the hit single "Dey Know", which was remixed by many major artists. While he never released a followup album, his legacy continued through a string of mixtapes. The infamy of his cancelled reality show and failed beef with T.I. (whom he later reconciled with) may overshadow his music to the public at large, he will be remembered as an Atlanta figurehead, bringing artists together and holding his city down to the end. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Shawty+Lo">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
