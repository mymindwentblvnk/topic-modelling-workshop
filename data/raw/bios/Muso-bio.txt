Muso is the name of a German rapper from Heidelberg, as well as of an L.A. based garage pop band.

L.A.:

Muso weds jangly garage pop with foot-stomping rhythm. Transplanted from Austin and San Diego, the band met in Los Angeles in 2004, and instantly clicked. Sharing a love of the past, but weary of just being kitschy, Josh, Brian, and Parker started writing genre-bending songs, drawing from 60's pop, dirty blues, and punk rock, sometimes all at once. The result was usually under three minutes, and raw. 

As a trio, Muso's music is stripped to the bone. They recorded their debut, "Transmute" live in the studio, to capture the controlled chaos at the core of their sound. The album's drawn comparisons to The Clash, The Stooges, The Minutemen and Fugazi.

The album "Skin Deep" is not by the L.A. based band Muso.
