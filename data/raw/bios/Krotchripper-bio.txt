Krotchripper is a band of two trolls who gnaw on the bones of the underground metal posers. Formed in late 2009, they have crushed all who dared to venture from their caves to witness the devastating aural onslaught. Inspired by bands such as Panzerchrist, Disgorge, and Devourment, Krotchripper has been attempting the fine art of brutality... TROLL STYLE!
