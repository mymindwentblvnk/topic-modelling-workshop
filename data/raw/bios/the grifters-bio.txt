The Grifters was a nationally popular and influential 1990s  rock band based in Memphis who released albums on Doink, Sonic Noise, Shangri-la Records, and Sub Pop Records.

The band originally formed in the late 1980s as A Band Called Bud, with vocalist/guitarist Scott Taylor, bassist Tripp Lamkins, and drummer Dave Shouse. After being renamed the Grifters (after the novel by Jim Thompson) by 1990, Shouse joined Taylor on guitar, with Stanley Gallimore taking over on the drums. Songwriting duties were shared between Shouse, Taylor and Lamkins. For several years in the 1990s they recorded primarily at Easley McCain Recording and were closely affiliated with Memphis' Shangri-La Records label for a time. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Grifters">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
