Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs, AKA Pigs x7, is an English rock band formed in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, United Kingdom in 2012. Their debut album, Feed the Rats, was released on United Kingdom label Rocket Recordings in 2017 to critical acclaim. The Guardian listed the band as one of their "top 40 newcomers" for 2018, and in 2018 their second album King of Cowards was released, described by The Guardian as "pulverizing but accessible metal".

In April 2020, the band released their third album, Viscerals, which gave them their first chart entry, reaching number 67 on the UK Albums Chart. In May 2020, The Guardian listed the album as one of the twenty best albums released so far that year in their mid-year list. An LP of live tracks, Off Cuts, was released in November 2020 exclusively through Rough Trade's record shops.

The band's music has been associated with psychedelic rock and heavy metal, as well as related genres doom metal and noise rock. Earlier releases tended toward longer, drawn-out tracks while the more recent releases from Kings of Cowards and Viscerals are predominantly shorter works.
