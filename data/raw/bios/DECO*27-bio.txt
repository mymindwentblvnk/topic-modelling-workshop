DECO*27 (デコ・ニーナ, Deko Niina, born December 16, 1986) is a Fukuoka-born Vocaloid producer and cover singer ("utaite") notable for his pop rock-style. Debuting in October 2008, his first work "Boku Mitai na Kimi Kimi Mitai na Boku" was an instant hit with over 100,000 views on NicoNicoDouga.

DECO*27 frequently uses virtual singer Hatsune Miku and VOCALOID GUMI (Megpoid) as an alternative to hiring singers.

Name origin
He picked "DECO" (lit. "forehead") because he has a large one and the numbers "2" and "7," because they are his favorite numbers. A glance at his keyboard inspired the asterisk. The numbers "27" are read "nii-na," as per the Japanese pronunciation.
