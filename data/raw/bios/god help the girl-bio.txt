God Help the Girl is a musical project authored by Stuart Murdoch, the leader of the Scottish indie pop group Belle and Sebastian, featuring, besides Belle & Sebastian as the accompanying band, a group of female vocalists, including Catherine Ireton. The records released as part of the project include so far: the singles Come Monday Night, Funny Little Frog (2009) and Baby, You're Blind (2010), the main album of the project, also entitled God Help the Girl, and the EP Stills (both published in 2009). In 2011, Stuart Murdoch plans to start shooting a musical film, which will feature the songs published in the singles and albums.

The songs of the project God Help the Girl belong to the genre of indie pop and resemble the other output of Belle & Sebastian in tone – two songs (Funny Little Frog and Act of the Apostle) were taken directly from the earlier repertory of this group. However, contrary to the earlier work of Belle & Sebastian – a group dominated by male performers, female vocalists (who are not members of the group) play the main role in the project. The songs themselves also tell about the problems of young girls entering adult life. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/God+Help+the+Girl">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
