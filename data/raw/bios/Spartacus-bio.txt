Spartacus can refer to multiple groups.

Spartacus (New Jersey, 2009-2010) consisted of members of Cats In The Grass, Crown, Genie In The Car Bomb, and The Ashes. They formed in early 2009 and broke up in late 2010. They experimented in combining post-hardcore, post-rock, and ambient music with pop sensibilities. They recorded a fair amount of material, but virtually none of it was released when they were active. Finally, in 2013, some of it is seeing the light of day on Loftman Records.
