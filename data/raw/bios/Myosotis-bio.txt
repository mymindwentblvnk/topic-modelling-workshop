Myosotis is an ambient duo from the Netherlands. Amandus and Evert have been making music together for around 3-4 years now, at first solely guitars and piano. As of last year they have started producing ambient music together because of a mutual interest for ambient, which they entitled the Myosotis project. First intentions of a duo were to create "two sides of the same coin", which would include Light as well as Dark ambiences, and to combine the two.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Myosotis">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
