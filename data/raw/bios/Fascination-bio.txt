1) An Indie Rock band out of Victoria BC
2) A Freestyle-Dance act based in New York

Born as Elsie Rodriguez in The Bronx, New York, Fascination, has always dreamed that one day she would be a successful recording artist. With that in her mind, she studied music, drama, and dance. Her love for dancing is what actually gave Fascination her big break in the Freestyle business. She was discovered dancing up a storm at the Copacabana in New York City, where she was introduced to producer Todd Terry.

Fascination's first release, "Why Ya Wanna Go" under Vinylmania Records, was a huge success that it was later followed by another huge hit, "Don't You Think It's Time". After the success of her first two releases, Fascination was signed to Lumar Records. In 1990, "Remember" was released and hit Billboard's Dance charts which then led to a major endorsement deal with Coca-Cola. During the time "Freestyle Lives" was released, Fascination had just released her next single under Cutting Records entitled "Still Miss You", and is/was currently collecting material for her a future album.

Fascination can be seen throughout the New York, Chicago, and Miami Club seen doing all of her hits. With recent performances including Mohegan Sun, Resorts Casino in New York City, and more, Fascination is still making the club seen through North America move.
