One half of On Dead Waves is James Chapman, better known as Maps, whose critically acclaimed debut "We Can Create" was nominated for the Mercury Music Prize, and whose latest album "Vicissitude", came out on Mute. The other is Polly Scattergood, the electrically charged artist who has released two solo albums on Mute.

The seeds of Chapman and Scattergood's creative partnership were sown in 2011, at Mute’s Short Circuit festival, a special event at London's Roundhouse. The night saw different collaborations with Mute artists and Polly and James paired up to perform each other’s songs. 

Their eponymous debut album is due to be released on May 20th 2016. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/On+Dead+Waves">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
