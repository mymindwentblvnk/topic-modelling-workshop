Adalruna is an official supporter of The Pagan Front - www.thepaganfront.com

Adalruna is a Symphonic Pagan/NS Black Metal project from the East Midlands (Chesterfield, Derbyshire) of England created in 2006. The lyrical themes include Nazi Occultism, Ariosophy and Norse Sagas. Wulfhelm is the sole member of Adalruna, playing guitar and bass, recording vocals and programming synth and drums for all releases. Adalruna has never had a real drummer and due to these restrictions has never performed live.

In 2007, Adalruna signed to Darker Than Black to release 2008’s ‘A Wolf in Hallowed Places’ and future releases including the upcoming album ‘The Apple and the Wish-Maiden Crow’. Wulfhelm has released all Adalruna material prior to ‘A Wolf in Hallowed Places’ through his own label Asgard’s Wall Records in a four album series titled ‘Anthology’ from August to November, 2009. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Adalruna">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
