Nails of Imposition was conceived in mid 2007 with Brendan Nock and Valent Macukat. Material quickly surfaced with the idea of creating brutal, technical death metal and the band sought other progressive death heads to join arms.

Over the next year the band experienced numerous member change. By August 2008 the band found a consolidated line-up in Chris Henderson, Jared Thornton and Matt Goodwin. With a shared vision of combining old school influences with modern brutality and technicality, more material was rapidly written and by November 2008 Nails of Imposition began playing live. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nails+of+Imposition">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
