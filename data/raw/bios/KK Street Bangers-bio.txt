KK Street Bangers started in Podgorica, Montenegro, in 2008 as project formed by Miloš Klikovac (guitar) and Marko Komlenac (vocal) for the passion to play fast and destructive thrash metal influenced by street life, alcohol and good old thrash metal cults that are worshiped by these two streetbangers. In this line-up they wrote a couple of songs. By the end of same year this metalized duo was reinforced by new member and old friend, bassist Branko Jugović who also took on the role of band's producer. This is the definite line-up of KK Street Bangers which consists of three maniacs possessed by pure metal might that drives their drunken minds. Through year 2009 band was working on new material, and same year band hit Branko's home studio Rebellion in order to record first EP - "Street, Rotten, Thrash Derby". Whole recording and mixing procedure, together with the effort dealing with cover artwork and layout design of EP, were finished in 2010. In October 2010 "Street, Rotten, Thrash Derby" was finally released, featuring four dirty songs of pure aggression and alcohol intoxication. This four tracks have been chosen among the other written material that should be recorded in the future.
