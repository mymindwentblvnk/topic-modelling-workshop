xian began playing trumpet at the age of 8 but stopped when his lips began to swell...eventually he picked up the guitar - his first “serious” outing was with arrow kleeman (lilienthal) in the band “mobius strip” in the early to mid 90's while they attended the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn.

From there xian went onto join forces w/ simeon of silver apples as sampler & oscillator player for a series of tours & recording that lasted, on & off, for a few years. xian left silver apples in late 98' to concentrate on his solo work as Sybarite. Sybarite incorporates many instruments, both acoustic & synthetic, in a warm hybrid of genres.

In his spare time, xian enjoys listening to the birds, architecture & wheat-free snacks.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sybarite">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
