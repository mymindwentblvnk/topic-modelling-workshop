Columbia Pirates are three music enthusiasts brought together by a common denominator - despite living thousands of miles apart. Flitting between influences as diverse as Mazzy Star, 4Hero, Stereo MCs, Basement Jazz, Air and Bj√∂rk, they write and record deceptively catchy tunes easily on par with their eclectic heroes. While the two boys go back a long way, it took a 'singer wanted' ad to find Rebekka. 'At first, we were a bit apprehensive, but after just a few bars we had made up our minds.' And none of them have ever looked back - 'Once you have made music a part of your life, there is no way back. Due to our current geographic constraints our multi-dimensional brainstorming tends to rely on the amazing possibilities of the Internet.' The result of this musical long-distance relationship: warm, organic sounds with a sprinkling of electronics or broken Latin beats, carried by Rebekka's expressive voice.
