Lucid Fear was formed in Larvik, Norway, in 1999. The line-up then was Cato Jensen (drums), Henrik Bruun (guitar/vocals) and Cathrine Paulsen (vocals). In 2000 Bjørn Erik Næss joined on guitar, and shortly after, Stig York joined on synth. Since Espen Engrønningen (bass) joined in 2002, the band has had a full line-up. 

After a series of self-made recordings the band entered a pro studio for the first time in 2001. The result was a 3-track demo which was never sent anywhere. In 2003 the band entered the studio again, only this time with the band’s own Henrik Bruun in charge of the recording, mixing and mastering. The result this time was a lot better, but the demo Silhouettes of dark remorse was also held back by the band to a certain extent. 

Although Lucid Fear has had a few concerts over the years, the band has primarily been a studio and underground band. Even so, the concert reviews have been great for every show, and some consider Lucid Fear to be far better live than on record.  

Now, in 2005, the band is stronger than ever! The self produced demo Mistro, has gotten Lucid Fear excellent reviews worldwide! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lucid+Fear">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
