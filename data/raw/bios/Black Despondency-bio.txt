Black Despondency were a Melodic Death Metal band from Cardiff. They combined razor sharp riffage, chaotic and punishing drumming, complex basslines and soul shredding demon vocals. They were influenced by bands such as arch enemy, at the gates and zao.
They never had an official recording. The recordings that surfaced and can be found on the bands myspace page remain unmastered. 

3 of the bands members are in the rehersal stages of a new project. They may even throw in the old classic song.
