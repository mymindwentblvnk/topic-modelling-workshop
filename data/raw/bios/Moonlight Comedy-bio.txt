Moonlight Comedy were formed in 1998 in Italy and immediately started to compose their own music together to resent an innovative sound and individual image. The influences of nineties progressive, power metal and hard rock music are specific characteristics of Moonlight Comedy. It is very evident from listening to just a few seconds of their new album "Dorothy" that the passion of the group lies in the fusion between melodic harmonies and innovative instrumental sequences.

The greatest characteristic of Moonlight Comedy is their continuous search for a sound that is able to integrate with completely free and limitless technique in order to spice up the final composition. "Dorothy" marks Moonlight Comedy's second release on Lion Music following the 2004 release "The Life Inside". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Moonlight+Comedy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
