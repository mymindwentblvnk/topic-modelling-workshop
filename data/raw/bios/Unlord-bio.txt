Unlord is a North European band existing since 1989. Unlord started out as a musical expression of some friends. They recorded three demos in a period of 6 years. None of those were ever available for sale. Their third demo got  the band a deal with Displeased records.  Unlord's goal was not big publicity; they only wanted people to enjoy their creations.

In 1997 Unlord released their cult debut album 'Schwarzwald.'  The band entered the studio again in the spring of 2000 to record their second album 'Gladiator', which was released in September 2000.  The band recorded their third and last album in 2001. 'Lord of beneath.'
