1) If the band Nyne was a movie, it would definitely be a sci-fi horror movie.

Creating music from electronic beats and sounds.
Grandeur orchestral themes.
All dressed with violent guitar riffing and chaotic unnatural vocals with a black metal attitude.
Nyne creates the atmosphere of a nightmare you would never want to live in.

The distant future.
The self destruction of mankind.
The reflection of time.
The paranormal...
Things you cannot see...
But you can hear the echoes.

Through Nyne...

The band formed back in 2002.
The idea was the unite the black metal cult with the new industrial sound.
Inspired by Sci-fi and horror movies. Nyne took part in several gigs.
Included Mayhem's concept in Athens in 23 January 2005.
In April 2005 Nyne started working on their new demo.
In co-operation with the producer Dimitri N. (Funeral Revolt. Siva Six). The result (4 track demo) sounds unique. And it could be described as futuristic industrial black metal. Now Nyne are in search of a contact with a record label.
