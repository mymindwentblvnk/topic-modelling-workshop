2. The Horror are also an electroclash outfit from South East London


3. The Horror formed in the fall of 1999 in Portland, Maine and describes their sound as ultra original 'death-lounge'. Rich, heavy, melodic, strange, old school/new school, entrancing rock with insane/evil undertones. Strange stories and theatrics weave in and around the rich tones of the vintage organs and expansive guitars giving one an understanding of fear, madness, joy and power.  They broke up in 2007.
