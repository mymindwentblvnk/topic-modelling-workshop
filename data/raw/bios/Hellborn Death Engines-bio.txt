Genius, mastermind, musically gifted, unbelievable: these are all words that the boys in Hellborn Death Engines definitely know how to spell.

This Calgary-bred crew of ragamuffins unleashed their furious thrash metal sound—heavily influenced by video games and pop culture—at their first show in February, 2013. The band, officially formed in 2011 but with roots harking back to 2009, has since gone on to tear mercilessly through Alberta, leaving empty beer cans and melted faces in their wake.

Now, they are working on releasing their debut album, “Welcome to the Hellmouth”, scheduled for July of 2014. When not recording, they have been diligently refining their craft through click track jam sessions and bouts of Mariokart 64.

The boys at Hellborn Death Engines have left an immediate imprint on t̶h̶e̶i̶r̶ ̶f̶r̶i̶e̶n̶d̶s̶ ̶a̶n̶d̶ ̶f̶a̶m̶i̶l̶y̶ the scene, and the future is undoubtedly bright for this mismatched four-piece. It’s gearing up to be a catastrophic display of disregard for both their bank accounts and well-being; don’t miss out on the fun. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hellborn+Death+Engines">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
