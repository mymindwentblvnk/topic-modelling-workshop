This awesome band started in Victoria Harbour, Ontario in 2005. Right from the start it was clear that this musically-gifted quartet was going places. After the first practice, a loyal fanbase spread to the towns of Midland, Penetanguishene, Balm Beach and Fesserton. 

Circumsion incorporates various musical genres into what they describe as "some seriously fucked up shit". Elements of death metal, grindcore, punk, reggae, and even rap are included on their self-titled full length album. 

Lineup:
Cody   - Drums/Guitar
Jon    - Guitar/Bass
Mike   - Vocals/Screaming Dumbass
Nathan - Bass/Guitar/Backing Vocals
