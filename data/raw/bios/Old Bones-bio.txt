1.) Old Bones is a Black metal band from Landskrona, Sk√•neland Sweden.

2.) Old Bones is a pop-rock project that developed over the fall/winter of 2014/2015 in Sackville, N.B., Canada. The band consists of Steve Haley (Banded Stilts), Jon Mckiel (Weird Lines, his own solo work), James Anderson (Weird Lines) and Scott Brown (Kappa Chow, Jerk Damaged). Klarka Weinwurm has regularly acted as a fifth member on backing vocals in a live setting.

3.) Old Bones is a hard hitting, thick blues duo from Calgary, Alberta. Tyler (guitar) and Riley (drums) started playing music together in 2007 as a means to better themselves at their respective instruments while trying to start other bands. But after being asked to play various venues (at the time with no name to go by, and not expecting the duo to be a permanent endeavour) they decided to keep playing as a two piece and record an EP to hand out at shows. In order to capture the live Old Bones sound, the recording was done on a small 4 track cassette deck, with each song being a single take, straight to tape.

The EP gained some attention and had 3 songs featured on CKXU radio, as well as a music sample/promo for the 2010 IGNITE! festival during an interview with the festival's director. 

The band has also placed in multiple indie band challenges showcasing their music and competing with other local bands. Upon winning a recording studio session, Old Bones made the decision to begin writing a full length album titled "Of A Different Colour" to be released later this year, and have been playing shows to help promote it since. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Old+Bones">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
