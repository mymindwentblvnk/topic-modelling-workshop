There is more than one artist named General Lee:

1)  post-rock, post-metal and hardcore General Lee band from Béthune, France.

Since 2002, General Lee never stopped to look forward their own definition of chaos, melting intensity, blackness and emotion in a shape that belongs to abrasive hardcore music. After some recording try-outs they definitely head out with a mammoth disc in the name of Hannibal ad Portas. This disc plays with feelings and contrasts by creating a tense climate near to the break. Icy and oppressive atmospheres, heavy and melancholic riffing are mixed ton an abrasive hardcore and a blowing off and cathartic screaming. A music that blurs and destroys the usual plans to be reconstructed in pain. One of a kind heavy doom.
