The Old Ceremony is a 'pop-noir' band from Chapel Hill, NC figureheaded by songwriter/raconteur Django Haskins (International Orange, Django & the Regulars). The Old Ceremony includes bassist Matt Brandau (Sankofa, Remix Project), drummer Dan Hall (Countdown Quartet), vibes/organist Mark Simonsen (Jackie O. Pillbox), Violinists Gabriele Pelli and cellist Josh Starmer. They are joined by a rotating cast of musical luminaries which have included pianist James Wallace, Daniel Hart on violin, Jil Christensen on accordion, Vamsi Tadepalli on sax, Will Caviness on trumpet, and Harmony Keeney on vocals.

Inspired by the Great American Songbook (and its finest interpreters such as Frank Sinatra and Chet Baker), as well as the theatricality of Tom Waits, Serge Gainsbourg, Astor Piazzolla and Nick Cave, The Old Ceremony creates their own shoebox panorama of a world of paper palm trees, unsolved mysteries and unopened air mail. It is distinctly American and faintly exotic. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Old+Ceremony">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
