Johnny and the Moon is a Canadian indie rock band, fronted by Dante DeCaro (ex-Hot Hot Heat and currently Wolf Parade). Based in Shawnigan Lake, British Columbia, the band also includes Lindy Gerrard, Mark Devoe, and Jeff "Big Juicy Papa" Phillips. The band's name is a play on Johnny and the Moondogs, the short-lived name of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, and George Harrison's band in 1959 before changing it to the Beatles.

The band released its self-titled debut album in 2006 on British Columbia, Canada-based record company Kill Devil Hills. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Johnny+and+the+Moon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
