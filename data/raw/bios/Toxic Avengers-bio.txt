2)Toxic Avengers were a 1980s punk/hardcore band from New Plymouth, New Zealand. In 1987, Colin Long (former member of Sticky Filth) joined members of Dioxin O.D to form Toxic Avengers (the name meaning Toxic as in Dioxin, a dangerous chemical made in the band's home town, and Avengers being revenge on Sticky Filth for kicking out their original member). They recorded an album called Full Moon Over Mushroom Town in 1989, produced by Bailter Space drummer Brent Maglocklin. In January 1990 Long was killed in a street fight. The band continued with Nigel Toxic, a 16 year old guitarist/vocalist from crossover hardcore/metal band Post-Mortem Depression. Toxic Avengers spent a year in this incarnation; in 1992 the band recorded an E.P. in memory of Long. Although the band split up in 1992, they went on to do many reunion shows. Toxic Avengers members went on to form: Nefarious, Evilis, GoatFucking NunRapers, Hideously Disfigured, Horror Story, and the drummer ended up in Sticky Filth.

Full Moon Over Mushroom Town was later released on CD by Demon Nation. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Toxic+Avengers">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
