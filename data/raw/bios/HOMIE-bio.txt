Homie is a side project of Rivers Cuomo, lead singer of the band Weezer. Homie is considered to be a one-time effort. Homie has released just one song, "American Girls", for the soundtrack of the 1998 film Meet the Deedles. For this recording, Cuomo was joined by Greg Brown member of Cake, Matt Sharp (formerly of Weezer, lead singer of The Rentals), Adam Orth of Shufflepuck and Yuval Gabay of Soul Coughing.

Weezer fans sometimes erroneously apply the Homie moniker to a totally different Cuomo-led group of Boston-area musicians that played several shows while Rivers took time off from Harvard. This group was not Homie, but were played under the guise of "solo" shows, and the material played at these shows were songs Rivers had written for the third Weezer album at the time. The material played at Homie shows were exclusive to the Homie project and are assumed to have been intended for the Homie album which was worked on in 1997 and 1998.

The song "Wanda", although originally written as a Weezer song for the movie Angus, is considered to be a Homie song since it was played during the Homie shows. The song "Wanda" was realeased on Alone - The Home Recordings of Rivers Cuomo, as "Wanda (You're My Only Love)".

According to Cuomo's blog, master tapes of recording sessions made during the Homie-era exist, but are largely unfinished, having only drum tracks laid down. Bootlegs of their live shows have been available online since 1997 and played a role in Weezer's resurgence following their second album, Pinkerton. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Homie">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
