HellArise is a band from São Paulo, Brazil, since 2009. Trying to get all the different influences from each member in their songs, the result is an aggressive and mixed kind of music, that travels between Heavy, Thrash and Death Metal.
After various changes, the current line-up is: Flávia Morniëtári (vocals), Thomas Meyer (guitars),  Kito Vallim (bass) and Daniel Crivello/artist] (guitar).
Their work consists of a demo CD (2010), the EP “Functional Disorder” (2013) and 4 singles, released between 2012 and 2016. 

A videoclip for the single “More Mindless Violence” was recorded at the same time as the EP, and it can be watched on YouTube (www.youtube.com/hellarise), among some lyric videos and live stuff, for the singles.
The band is now working on a full-lenght to come.
