1. Saqqara is a Melodic metal band from Valencia, Spain. Over the years, Saqqara has evolved from making music reminiscent of an amalgam of loved bands like Iron Maiden, Metallica, Helloween, Dream Theater, Bar√≥n Rojo, Dire Straits and Whitesnake into their own personal unbounded style. Two albums are the product of creativity and fun-playing: "Tristeza"(1999) y "El nuevo Mundo"(2003). A new album is on the works and due soon.

2. Saqqara was also a 90s screamo/hardcore band from Sioux Falls, SD who released a split 7" with better-known SD screamo band Spirit of Versailles.
