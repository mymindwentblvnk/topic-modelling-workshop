Few bands can match the ferocity and sheer brutal combination of melodic death and vile symphonic black metal that I Am the Trireme (pronounced "i am the tri' reem") has conjured. Hailing from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, IATT bring forth a relentless, fast paced, crushing wall of blackened brutality and haunting melodies. Listeners can expect to hear a searingly dark, aggressive blend of brutality and purely sinister blackened metal, that is sure to leave them foaming at the mouth.
Conceived in 2008, I Am the Trireme quickly began to heave their mass out of the dark abyss and shape themselves into a great leviathan in the world of extreme metal along side acts such as Rotting Christ, Goatwhore, Suffocation, Exhumed, and literally countless other heavy hitters in the extreme metal community - proving IATT themselves as equals in the genre.
While never claiming to be strictly black metal, IATT hold strong to belief of black metal in its purest form - unencumbered and in direct opposition of ALL religious ties and affiliations. In a time where ideals and strong beliefs have shifted into trends and thoughtless practices, leaving the scene littered with hollow shells in the image of our forefathers, I Am the Trireme sets a course true to their convictions and shines an unapologetic ghostly light through the fog into the beyond. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/I+Am+the+Trireme">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
