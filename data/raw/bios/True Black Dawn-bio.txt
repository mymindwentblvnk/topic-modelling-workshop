TRUE BLACK DAWN Originally called Nocturnal Feast, then Black Dawn, but they had to change their name to True Black Dawn due to the US band Black Dawn who actually own the name.

It all started in 1993 (finland). Cauldron, Wrath, Tero, Marko, Jussi changed the name Nocturnal Feast into Black Dawn. Before the recording of the 2nd demo in May, Black Dawn was in war with the local mob of Jehovah worshippers the police and one particular priest. In the first quarter of the year the Black Dawn fell to pieces once more. Only Wrath and Cauldro, were left. The old way became their goal once more. Before the summer Black Dawn found new members : Anzhaar and Gaunt.
