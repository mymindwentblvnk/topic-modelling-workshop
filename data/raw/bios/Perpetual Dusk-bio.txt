The Brazilian Melodic Black Metal band Perpetual Dusk started out by mid-2000, in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. After one year of hard work, the band released its first work: the demo-CD "Waiting For The Nightfall". A series of concerts in Belo Horizonte and nearby cities, and an intense marketing made with the help of correspondents, zines and magazines, promoted this demo CD. This was the first step for the band, and two years later, with a new line up and a more professional structure, the band released its second and successful work: the demo CD “Incarnated Darkness”.

With this new promo stuff, the band carried out an even greater marketing campaign, getting excellent reviews from all the specialized media. Some good results soon followed, bringing invitations, opportunities and important concerts with great names of the Black Metal world scene, such as Dark Funeral, Averse Sefira, Gorgoroth and Enthroned.

After that, the band signed with the label Cogumelo Records for the release of its first full length, which is called: “Supreme Black Victory”. Produced by Marcos Amorim at DR Studios, during January and March of 2005, and released on July of the same year, Perpetual Dusk’s debut CD presents Black Metal music at its most extreme and hateful essence, making real the results of the band’s unending battle on the Brazilian Underground.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Perpetual+Dusk">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
