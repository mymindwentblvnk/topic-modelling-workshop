Darwin Deez: He plays a 4-string electric guitar of his own invention, which has secret tuning. He was raised by Baba Lovers (followers of Avatar Meher Baba, like Pete Townshend) in Chapel Hill, NC. Five years ago, he left Wesleyan University to start a band in New York City. Their current live set features his original songs, harsh electronic noise, and bouts of synchronized dancing. Darwin has been dubbed the Michael Jackson of indie rock, for his luscious locks, spirited dancing, and catchy songs. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Darwin+Deez">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
