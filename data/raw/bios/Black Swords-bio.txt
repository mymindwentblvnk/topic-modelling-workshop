Orphan Swords Collide With Black Rain on New Black Swords Project “Collaboration in the time humans call the twenty first century. They come and some go. Some stick together due to ease of mode, likemindedness, a certain outlook. Whatever it is, you know it when you feel it working.” SA In late 2013, Brussels based industrial music renegades Orphan Swords invited Ike Yard to do a vocal featuring for their track Vassago (Risk In A New Age EP, Desire Records 2014). It was the beginning of a long term collaboration between NYC-based electronic pioneer Black Rain and the duo. Later on, Orphan Swords was invited by Desire to remix an Ike Yard track for a compilation around the reissue of their 1983 classic album “A Second”. Orphan Swords then invited Black Rain to remix Asmoday from their EP “License To Desire”. BR project with Shinichi Shimokawa - rebooted in 2012 on Blackest Ever Black. The three musicians became close friends over time, not merely sharing interest in music, they kept on exchanging on many topics on a regular basis. In April 2016, after BR performed at Rewire Festival with Pete Swanson and Vessel, they spent a night in Brussels at Orphan Swords’ HQ “New Terminal Studios (NTS)” and recorded hours of music in the most direct fashion. This raw material has then been simmered within the following weeks. The two tracks that figure on “The Future Of The Sun” EP are the pith and marrow of what occurred that night. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Black+Swords">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
