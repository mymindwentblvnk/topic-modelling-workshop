Born from the depths of obscure analog gems, lies Cassadaga Florida’s dream pop/shoegaze offering, Cathedral Bells. Conceived as a solo experiment in the Fall of 2018, Matthew Messore crafted jangly guitar and synthesizer layered demos in his bedroom. He soon released a self-titled EP in 2019, followed by full length ‘Velvet Spirit’ in 2020. Drawing from influences of the 80s, 90s, and early 2010s, Messore (joined by Aaron Gollubier on drums and Kyle Hoffer on bass) blends dreamy soundscapes that draw you in.
