Inanimate is a Swedish death metal band from Stockholm, Sweden. They formed in mid 2009 as guitarist Pontus Rissanen and guitarist (former keyboardist) Andreas Chang started jamming and writing music together at home. Rissanen was friends with bassist Matti Karlsson who was more than willing to join the newly founded band.

As time progressed they started searching for a place to rehearse and, eventually, they ended up at Black Sheep, the rehearsal studio where Karlsson played with his old band, Beyond Confined. At this time, Rissanen had found a drummer, Oscal Fahl, and brought him to their first session at Black Sheep.

The band played together for a couple of months but lacked both a vocalist and a rhythm guitarist. Chang, who had just started to learn guitar at the time, left his post as keyboardist to become the rhythm guitarist instead. But a vocalist was still missing, so the band kept looking for one. Soon enough they came in contact with Casper Bringholm. He was brought to rehearse with the band and immediately joined as a full time member.

In July 2011 Inanimate's first (though unofficial) demo, entitled Demo MMXI, earned attention in Swedish rock/metal magazine Close-Up Magazine, being recognized as a release of Stockholm's trademarked death metal as well as being compared to Hypocrisy's Penetralia.

Shortly after, vocalist Casper Bringholm parted ways with the band due to personal cirumstances.

In march 25, 2012, the band released their first official demo, Fleshfeast. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Inanimate">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
