As a black trans woman, she has faced a lot of adversity, and she expresses that in her music. In an interview with Bitchfork, she says “I had to find myself… and I felt that hip hop was a good place to explore that because it sounds so rebellious and it gives form for you to be able to create all of these vivid stories“.
