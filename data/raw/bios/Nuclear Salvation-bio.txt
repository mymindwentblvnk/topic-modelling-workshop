NUCLEAR SALVATION are a Swedish thrash metal band formed in 2010. With two killer albums out on the market, a powerful stage show from which they have received amazing reactions worldwide and a recently signed worldwide deal with Metal Music Bookings & Management.

The band are influenced by 80's thrash metal, but have developed a personal and partly more melodic sound presenting touches of traditional thrash, with fresh and well produced overtones.

After setting up initially as a studio project, Nuclear Salvation released their first full length album on May 31 2011, ‘The Beginning Of The End’. Since then the band has toured Europe supporting bands such as Ill-Disposed and Raunchy, and their latest (2014) release, ‘Ruins Of Reality’, has also had great reviews in both magazines and webzines worldwide. 

‘Ruins Of Reality’ was mixed by the world famous producer Fredrik Nordström (At The Gates, Arch Enemy, In Flames and many more) and features a furious guest solo from guitarist Steve Smyth (Forbidden, Nevermore, Testament).

Nuclear Salvation are working on new brutal songs and booking future gigs along with their management. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nuclear+Salvation">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
