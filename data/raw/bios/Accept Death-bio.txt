Accept Death is a sludge band from Mentor, Ohio that formed in 2005 from the ashes of previous bands like Fistula, Hemdale and Die Hard (pre-Integrity on Conversion Records). The band was originally to have Steve Makita from Apartment 213 (Retribute Records) on vocals, but it soon became obvious that Steve wouldn't have the time to fulfill vocal duties in 2 bands, so Matt decided to take on the role of lead vocals while playing guitar, and as he was the main vocalist in Hemdale, the job was only fitting. On the strength of rehearsal recordings and word of mouth the band soon came to the attention of Retribute Records, who signed them at the end of 2005 to record their debut self-titled full length.

Line up:
Matt J. Rositano - Vocals, Guitar, Bass
Scott Stearns - Guitar
Corey Bing - Drums
