The idea of Dead March was come up when the band started playing some stuff with their new materials. At the time, Masoud Moghadari handled all guitar instruments and Saeed Mandegar played keyboards. After a few weeks they had started to write some new stuff parallel with covering some of their favorite songs but, mostly they were experiencing the new face of metal music. During the following years the band took on melodic death metal which was their favorite style and the carrier seems to be continued in this genre of music. In the summer of 2011 the band formally started to write some new songs for specified purpose as an EP album. After one year of writing/composing four songs, they started recording and it took about five months. In the beginning of May 2012, Moghtada Gharbavi (Pop/Classical singer) was invited as a guest musician for their clean vocals while Mehrzad Nouri has joined the band as the harsh vocalist. During a month, Chris Lucas Productions studio was targeted and the first EP album was produced by Mr. Chris Lucas. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dead+March">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
