BESTIAL DEATH was an Israeli Death/Thrash Metal band, which was active during the mid-80's and recorded but never released a 5-tracks called "Suicide of the Immortal" in 1986, which was ahead of its time and presented a new for that time level of savagery and brutality, which could be reached only by back then absolutely obscure and unknown in Israel bands from South America.

After being kept in total secret for as long as nearly a quarter of a century, far from the reach of mortals, one of the most evil and uncompromising sounding Death/Thrash demos ever is going to be unleashed by Israhellbanger Records in the classic tape format, exactly as it should have been done back in 1986, when it was recorded! POSSESSED by the will to KREATE total chaos and SODOMy, these 3 young Israeli maniacs forged a demo that makes MORBID VISIONS sound like ARISE! BESTIAL DEATH created the vortex of sonic violence that is SUICIDE OF THE IMMORTAL by practiced the methods of destruction used only in South America back in those days, by such acts as Vulcano, Parabellum and Pentagram. Expect 5 utterly raw and chaotic sounding rituals of blasphemy that spit on all the nowadays technical and sterile sounding so-called “extreme metal”. 

SUICIDE OF THE IMMORTAL is scheduled to be released in June 2010 on pro-tape, featuring a 1” logo pin and an A4 poster. No “special” versions, no efforts to raise the “quality” of the sound and no compromises will be made, a genuinely extreme Metal demo that sounds like a  genuinely extreme Metal demo is what you’ll get!  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bestial+Death">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
