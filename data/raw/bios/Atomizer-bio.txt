There are two acts that are known by the name Atomizer: a blackened thrash metal band and an electro act.

1) Atomizer, a blackened thrash metal band, formed in July 1998 with the intention of playing rock 'n' roll styled black metal. Recording their first demo in December 1998 did not quite go as planned, and that original line up dissolved soon after this. However, the band got a record deal with End All Life productions for a vinyl only release of their debut album The End Of Forever (reissued as The Death Of Forever), the LP sold out surprisingly fast and a CD version followed not long after. 

A 7" was the next official release and Gimme Natural Selection was a 4 track EP released by Nihilist Void Records from Norway in 500 copies. The first 100 on white, the second on red and the last 300 on black. This record featured two covers - Ace Of Spades by Mot√∂rhead, and Wish You Were a Beer by the Cycle Sluts From Hell. 

Death Mutation Disease Annihilation was the second Atomizer album and while it took two goes at recording it, it did eventually happen and it was released on LP again by End All Life Productions in April 2002 and then on CD by Drakkar Productions in September 2002. This was the last recording that would feature guitarist Justin Allen, who was removed from the band in October 2001.

In 2002 the band released another two 7" EPs. The band also put out a split 7" with Root that year via the AJNA Offensive.

In the start of 2003, the band began recording their third album, The Only Weapon Of Choice, which was released five months later.
The album was released on the following formats:
*CD - Australia and New Zealand (Animosity International)
*Gatefold LP - Worldwide (AJNA Offensive)
*Pic Disc LP - Worldwide (Agonia Records)
*CD - Worldwide (Agonia Records)
*Ltd Edition DCD - Worldwide (Agonia Records)

After this release, the band worked on Songs Of Slaughter - Songs Of Sacrifice. This release is a little more experimental than their other releases and also contains an instrumental track.
This release is available in the following formats:
*Double gatefold 7" EP with Poster on Agent Orange Vinyl (Hells Headbangers)
*Double pic disc 7" EP in cloth bag with insert (Hells Headbangers)
*Mini CD with bonus track (Hells Headbangers)
*Double CD (Disc II of Weapon) (Agonia Records)

Live activity was ceased in September 2004, and after the passing of drummer Suds, there will never be another chance for a live performance. A live 10" called Atomic Bloodlust was released during the first half of 2007 by Hells Headbangers and a final studio album was released in 2007 as well.

2) Atomizer is a London-based electro duo Jonny Slut and Fil OK, who in addition to running the popular alternative electro club night 'Nag Nag Nag', have released a number of underground club singles.
