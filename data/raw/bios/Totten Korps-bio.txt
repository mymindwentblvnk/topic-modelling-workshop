Death metal band Totten Korps formed in Santiago, Chile, in 1989. Following a series of demo releases (including 1990's "The King of Hell Reclaims His Throne" and 1993's "Our Almighty Lords", issued by Brazilian Hellion Records) which helped establish them in the extreme metal tape-trading underground, the band was sidelined with personnel problems for a number of years. Eventually re-emerging in 1998 with founding members Fernando Toro (guitar) and Gerardo Valenzuela (vocals) joined by Francisco T. (guitar), Cristian Ort√≠z (bass), and Sergio Aravena (drums), the band signed with Repulse Records, but continued to struggle, eventually shelving an entire album due to poor production and sound. Finally, after losing Valenzuela (bassist Ortiz taking over vocal duties) and guitarist Francisco (replaced by Cristian Soto), Totten Korps made their international debut in 2001 with "Tharnheim: Athi-Land-Nhi, Cyclopean Crypts of Citadels". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Totten+Korps">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
