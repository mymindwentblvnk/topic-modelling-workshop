December Moon was a black metal band founded in 1995 by Robin Eaglestone and William "Was" Sarginson. Both of them involved at one time or another with British black metal band Cradle of Filth. In a very short-lived affair, December Moon recorded a single album in 1996 entitled Source of Origin before apparently losing interest in their mission.
