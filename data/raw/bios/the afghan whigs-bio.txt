American band The Afghan Whigs were a soul-influenced, alternative rock band that was mainly active in the 1990s. While achieving only moderate commercial success, the Afghan Whigs attracted ample critical acclaim and deeply loyal fans, Rolling Stone described the band as spending “the bulk of their career on the brink of stardom”, yet they’ve “never quite broken beyond a substantial legion of devotees enamored of their thinly veiled sleaze.”
