Emerging from the ashes of Newcastle bands "Immortal Existence" & "Hostility", "Ascending Ashes" stand for technically Presque, brutally heavy metal. Creating a unique blend of Metal, Thrash & Hardcore, their debut EP, "Upon Ruins We Stand', more than puts a nail in the coffin of that statement! Not to be underestimated, the band is quickly gaining interest with an intense live performance and songs being aired regularly on “Intensity Metal Radio 2NURFM” & "SWR 99.9FM". This alone has earned them some great support slots with bands including Daysend, Frankenbok, Switchblade, and Inane Eminence. Originally forming in late 2005, Ascending Ashes began after guitarist "Danny Burgess" & ex-guitarist "Lachlan Harrison" agreed on combining members from each band & creating a fresh sound as theirs' was not propelling them in the metal scene. Lachlan & vocalist "Pete Thrift" originally formed half of metal outfit "Hostility", while Danny, drummer "Joe Perry" & bassist " Jordan 'Stooge' Adams" formed three quarters of defunct metalcore act "Immortal Existence". With a then solidified line-up, the members of AA were ready to take on the all too familiar scene once again. Two guitarists later, the newest line-up sees the addition of 2nd guitarist & band member sibling, "Paul Burgess". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ascending+Ashes">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
