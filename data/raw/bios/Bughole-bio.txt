The band exists since 2004. The demo bughole was recorded the same year and showed that the 5 guys wanted more than just playin local shows. 2005 was the year of changes for the band. The founding member MÃ¶ller (drums) left the band was replaced by Max. Two month later the band signed their first record deal @ R.P.M. Records London and recorded their first single fucked up. 2006 the band recorded another demo called fight me. During the 2 years of its existing the band played gigs all over Germany and became well known in the undergound . The music of bughole can be discribed like that: A thunderstrom of brutal riffing, punching basslines and a roaring drumset. Just thrash metal. For the future the band tries to do what they can do best: Play live in front of a freaky, moshing crowd.
