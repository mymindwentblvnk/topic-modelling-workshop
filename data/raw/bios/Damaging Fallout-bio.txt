Damaging Fallout is a death metal metal band which was formed in  the late 2003 by Jussi Laakso and Timo Ruokola, the two guitarists of the band. The drummer, Veikko Kyyrö, became a member of the group at the fall of 2004. 
The band had troubles finding a vocalist and a bass player, since the group was located in a small village. Jussi's little brother Kalle (Laakso) became the vocalist for the band in the winter 2006 as Jussi had encouraged him to start practising growling. 
The bass player slot was open until the late spring of 2008 until Kari Olli, Timo's friend became convinced of the band's potential and joined the group as the long-missing bassist. Due to the fact that the band, Pressure Points, he was mainly focusing on, had an increasing amount of gigs during the year 2008, he decided to leave Damaging Fallout. 
The current bass player, Antti Jylhä, was discovered through internet in October 2008.

The band has released two demos. The first one, Last One Alive, was recorded in June 2007, and the lattest one, Chains Of Rule, during the April 2008. 

The band performs very technical death metal with progressive and melodic flavours.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Damaging+Fallout">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
