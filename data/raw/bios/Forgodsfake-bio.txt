From Almada, Portugal, FORGODSFAKE are born from the shrapnel of what they once were. Former members of some of the most respected bands in the Portuguese musical scene (Painstruck, Twentyinchburial, Judged by greed, Straightshot, Shrapnel), these five rockers joined to create a dominant sound which gathers around the strength, clout and aggressiveness that ultimately defines them as a metal crossover act. Their music embodies the muscle of the hardcore, the raw power of metal and the beauty of memorable melodies, supercharged by their unique sense of urgency and intensity. Now they’ve come to make their stand and show everybody the pleasure they have in creating heavy music. With the debut album coming in 2007, FORGODSFAKE are now ready to prove the world what they’re made of ... So join them... it’s time to ROCK!!!
