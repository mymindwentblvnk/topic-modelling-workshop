From Their Website Bio:

With roots firmly planted in Midwestern soil, The Phoenix Rising is very much a product of their environment. Brought together in early 2002, the small, steel town Indiana boys (and girl) that make up The Phoenix Rising were disenchanted with the pop-punk drones of their near neighbor counterparts from Chicago. Indiana has a history of producing artists who do things their own way. From Axl Rose and Shannon Hoon to the more appropriately comparable Murder by Death and Brazil, The Phoenix Rising continue the tradition of not giving in to the pressures of “what’s in” and more importantly making the music that they want to make without compromise.

After just sixteen shows The Phoenix Rising signed with Action Heights Records and released the Looking Glass War EP. A mere 4 months later the band recorded their debut full length, Lullaby, in New York at Nada Studios with John Naclerio (My Chemical Romance, Senses Fail, Armor for Sleep, Steel Train, etc.) The release of Lullaby garnered the attention of critics, labels, and other artists alike. John Bernstein of The Beautiful Mistake listed The Phoenix Rising in his top 5 bands to look out for in 2004 according to TheScout.net.

With a national tour and countless shows throughout the Midwest under their belt, The Phoenix Rising was most recently invited to play the 2004 Vans Warped Tour. The success of Lullaby and an ever growing audience has pushed The Phoenix Rising to plan a summer tour and continue work on their follow-up full length. Also, they will be appearing on a Smashing Pumpkins Tribute album with the likes of Thursday, From Autumn to Ashes and Atreyu due out in June of 2005.
