Initially Jon Sa Trincha (Ibiza DJ, 

compiler of The Salinas Sessions), 

myself - Luke Lockhart and Alex Maranca 

got together did a track Star Sailor which went on the Salinas Sessions for Sony (5/5 DJ Mag). Then I got offered an album deal by Irma records....collaborated with a few music buddies on a few tracks as well Neil Conti (Bowie/Jagger etc) Andy Kremer (Zohar/Incognito/Gabrielle) Eran Cohen (Jazz Warriors/Zohar) and Leslie Craig who sung on the track which charted No 3 in The Cafe Del Mar dance chart in Ibiza and Spain called Looking across the river.....hopefully we will get some royalties soon. All da best....if you type Lockhart into itunes it brings up the album - you can hear it..
