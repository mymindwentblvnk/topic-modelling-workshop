Lebanon Hanover is a post-punk duo based in Berlin, Germany and Newcastle, UK, founded in 2010 by Larissa Iceglass (guitar, vocals)  and William Maybelline (bass, vocals).
Iceglass met her partner-in-music, William Maybelline, over the internet. Conversing through music recommender website LastFM, they initially sent each other ’80s YouTube videos, establishing their shared love of music. Eventually Iceglass took the trip to Maybelline’s home in Sunderland in North England and the rest, as they say, is history. 
They offer an ice cold post-punk, fascinated by the beauty of art nouveau aesthetics, exploring British seashores and forests at night as well as inspired by the urbanism of Berlin.
