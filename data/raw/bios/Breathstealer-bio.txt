Breathstealer is a Belgian metal band that was formed in the summer of 2002 by FranÃ§ois de Bock, Kevin Nolis and David Collet (former bands: Silicium and Introspection). They knew a good bass player Gilles Major but although he didn't felt ready to join a band, still he did a few moths later.
After auditioning some guitarists for the new band without really good results, Kevin introduced Jelle Maes (former bands: Meagan and Scythslain) to the band. When Jelle came for an audition, everything turned out very well. After rehearsing one year and writing the first songs Breathstealer did its first performance at the Red Devils club in Drogenbos on July 12,2003.
