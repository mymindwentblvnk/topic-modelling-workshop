Band formed in 1994 by bass player Carlos Diaz (Vulcano, Hierarchical Punishment) and  Fernando Nicolini (vocal) (Masakra) in order to make a death metal aggressive and without fanciness, set the name DHUEND. 

Later joined the drummer Wagner Abreu (ex Praelii Dominus) and the guitarist  Evandro Romero (Dominus Praelii). 

With the team complete, they did many shows in Brazil, opening for big bands like Napalm Death, Deeds Of Flash and others. 

They record 2 demo-tapes, the first in 1996 entitled In Coma State with the songs: Alcohol Serial Killer and Epidemic Industry which was widely accepted by the underground scene.

The second demo released for promotional purposes to record labels and fanzines had only one song that gave name The Vengeance Preceedes the Divinity,  recorded in 1998, also in the city of Londrina. 

After the bass player left,  the band finishes its work in 2000.
