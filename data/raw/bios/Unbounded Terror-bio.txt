Mallorca's Unbounded Terror was one of the very first Spanish death metal bands. It was formed from the ashes of band Toxic Waste, and after that they were called Putrefeact Monstruosity until june 1991, when they adopted the name Unbounded Terror. The band was promoted by legendary label Drowned Productions whose owner, Dave Rotten (Avulsed) has been a very good friend of band's leader guitarist Vicente J. Paya since 1990. After releasing Nest of Affliction in 1992 the band was "frozen" for a while by Vicente because of the problems with the line-up.

With the new member, singer Amon Lopez and brothers Garciolo - David (Drums) and Gustavo (Guitars) Vicente founded a new temporary doom project - Golgotha (Esp). After signing a deal with Rotten's Drowned Productions and releasing Caves of Mind EP, the project became permanet and Unbounded Terror was dead forever. The rest is history.
