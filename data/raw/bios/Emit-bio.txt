Emit is a black noise/black ambient band from Somerset, United Kingdom, formed in 1998 by Unknown Ikon (guitar, vocals, field recordings, etc).

The project formed from the remnants of the black metal band Ante Cryst (formed 1997, changed name to AnXpm in 2006â€”this band also now being defunct). While elements of black metal were still present on Emit's first releases, the recordings became increasingly improvisatory and unhinged (see 'The Dark Bleeding Gods' compilation from 2009 for perhaps the most obvious example of this) with various occult practices and references to supernatural themes guiding the thematic approach to albums such as 'The Mysterious Unknown' and 'Unknown Presences Whisper'.

2008 ushered in a new phase for Unknown Ikon's (now Michael Morthwork) music and a name change to Hammemit. This development led to recordings with a more ritualistic/neo-medieval sound, devoid of percussion. In 2012, however, Emit returned with a new release titled "Spectre Music of an Antiquary" which largely eschewed the harsh noise-based approach of previous records in favour of warped, electronic-tinged ambience.
