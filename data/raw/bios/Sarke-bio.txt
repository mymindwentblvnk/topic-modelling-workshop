SARKE consists of Sarke (Khold, Tulus, Old Man's Child and Sensa Anima) and Nocturno Culto of Darkthrone. SARKE is a mesmerizing journey through dark and soothing soundscapes, inspired by legends like Mayhem, Slayer, Darkthrone, Celtic Frost, Black Sabbath, Candlemass, Death, Motorhead and Kreator. Sarke has so far released five full-length albums.

When forming the band in 2008, Sarke wanted to create the kind of music that has inspired him since he got into the extreme metal scene, and enlisted Nocturno Culto from the mighty Darkthrone, making the core of the project complete. All the music and lyrics are written by Sarke, but adding Nocturno's legendary voice to these songs, without a doubt, adds another dimension to the grimness.

The debut album Vorunah was recorded in November 2008, and even though the album was recorded in old-fashioned 70's style to get the true vibe of the music, the sound is brutal, fresh and up to date. This is nothing less than a modern classic â€“ a timeless masterpiece of sinister tonality. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sarke">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
