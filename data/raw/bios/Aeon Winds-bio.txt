Aeon Winds was created in 2007 by Svarthen (ex-Concubia Nocte, ex-Karpathia). From the very beginning, the main goal of the group was to create black metal with unique atmosphere. In 2012 the debut “Those Who Will Remain Silent Forever” was released and after various split albums, for example with Midnight Odyssey and Troll, Aeon Winds released their second album called "Stormveiled". Their sound can be characterized by distinctive melodies and melancholic atmosphere combined with black metal in the vein of Emperor and old Limbonic Art. Aeon Winds lyrically delves into lore about Carpathian mountains and mythology.
