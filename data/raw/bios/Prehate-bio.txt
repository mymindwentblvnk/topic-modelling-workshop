Prehate is a young 4-piece Metalcore Band from Brixen (South Tyrol/Italy) that tries to mix groove with speed.
After months in their rehearsal room and many concerts they finally deceided to release their first full lenght album in 2010.
The release of the album and their second videoclip was a huge success, as they were able to attract more than 500 visitors to the show.
Every member of the band was already active in other bands, also in other genres, before forming Prehate in 2007.
During the last years Prehate had the chance to play several shows with bands like Caliban, Evergreen Terrace, Maroon, Black Bomb A and Exilia.

2011 will be a significant year for the band, so the band will try to conquer european festival stages step by step and spread their music all across the globe.
