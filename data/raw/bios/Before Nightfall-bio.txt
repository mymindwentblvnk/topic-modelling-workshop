Before Nightfall are a rapidly growing Australian melodic death metal quartet from Brisbane, gaining a large following in Australia and worldwide. Their music combines the perfect amount of classical and modern melodies, lightning fast solos, with gut wrenching breakdowns and sadistic growls to create a sound rarely heard on the Australian Metal scene. Constantly outdoing themselves, Before Nightfall have quickly gained a respectable name amongst their hometown for their punishing live performances.
December 2011 saw Before Nightfall's debut release with their self produced full length album 'Smiling At Your Sorrow'. With Australian and European tours in sight, this young energetic band will continue to impress audiences around the world.

Three songs from their debut album 'Smiling at your Sorrow' peaked at #1, #2 and #3 on the Triple J Unearthed Metal Charts (one of the most widely known Australian Radio Stations), as well as #9, #16 and #23 on the Overall charts (the only band classified under the Metal genre to be in the TOP 20). 

Headlining 'Ye Gods Of Metal Festival' two years in a row, Headlining the 'Ye Gods of Metal Christmas Spectacular', receiving a partnership with YouTube, receiving airplay in the UK, America, Finland, Australia and more, as well as being featured on many different national/international interviews validates that Before Nightfall continue to turn heads.

The bands rapidly growing fan base as well as their impressive and overly energetic live performances proves Before Nightfall  are ready to be a worldwide success.
