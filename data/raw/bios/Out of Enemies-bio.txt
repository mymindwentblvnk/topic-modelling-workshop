Formed in late 2005 'Out Of Enemies' are 5 piece metal band from Honiton, Devon. With influences ranging from In Flames to Lamb Of God, and 36 Crazyfists to The Haunted, its hard to describe their own particular brand of metal. 
After a few member changes,and a rough demo CD, they finally found a solid line-up and managed to sign a record deal with independent label Rising Records. They have recorded their Debut album 'Into The Darkness' which is out now!!! 
Soon after the release of the album, they quickly recieved rave reviews accross the board, here is just a few of the kind words said;

Rock Sound : "...England's answer to Lamb Of God and Killswitch Engage...8/10"

Kerrang : "...There isn't a bad song on here, and with a fist in the air anthemic bent is undoubtedly the kind of uproar that should incite denziens of th mosh pit to hurt themselves and each other...3K's"

Big Cheese : "...The songs pretty much slay and are played with a high level of proficiency...Taking their influences from metal heavyweights In Flames and Lamb Of God, the guys create a thoroughly modern brand of metal...3/5"
