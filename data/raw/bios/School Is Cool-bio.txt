School is Cool are an indie band from Belgium, founded in late 2009. Debut album 'Entropology' (2011) introduced Belgium, the Netherlands and France to School is Cool's indiepop in the form of a 16-song chaotic cathedral-like structure of energetic drums, eighties synths, dark, apocalyptic lyrics and grand, baroque choruses, produced by Das Pop's Reinhard Vanbergen. 2012 and '13 saw the band touring Belgium (including Rock Werchter and Pukkelpop), the Netherlands, Switzerland, Austria, Germany and France, and playing at showcase festivals like Eurosonic, The Great Escape and Popkomm. One of School is Cool's strong suits is its extremely intense, energetic live performance, combining complex baroque arrangements with a punk-like desperate rage. On stage and on record, influences of Pixies, the Dodos, Menomena, Kate Bush and Bruce Springsteen go hand in hand with 18th century orchestral music and tribal, ethnic percussion. In 2014 they released 'Nature Fear', their self-produced second album, planned to be released in 2014. The band now consised of Johannes Genard, Matthias Dillen, Toon Van Baelen, Dieter Beerten and Hanne Torfs. Michael Van Ostade, Nele Paelinck, Andrew Van Ostade and Justine Bourgeus left the band between 2012 and 2014 for several different reasons. A third album is on the way with a new single in 2017 as teaser.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/School+Is+Cool">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
