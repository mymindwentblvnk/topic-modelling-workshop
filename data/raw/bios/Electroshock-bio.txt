Electroshock is the brand behind which two Italian musicians and producers are active, in different roles, already since the â€˜90s, with productions published by Sony, Emi and other independent labels. Their work is a fusion of passions for keyboards, mixers, electronic, computer, acid and melodic sounds, madness and reason. You Are A Star is the first juicy fruit of this collaboration. Vocoder, effects, rhythm and melody to never stay still. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Electroshock">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
