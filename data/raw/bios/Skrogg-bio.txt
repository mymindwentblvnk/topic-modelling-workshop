Skrogg is a heavy, doomy, bloozed out beast from the backwoods of NH.

Reverend, Jasper and Felix met in the Fall of 2010 and decided to form a heavy handed 70’s style power trio.
The writing started immediately with songs that would later end up on their EP "Raw Heat," self released in October 2011 on there own label Drug Rug Records. They spent 2012 playing numerous gigs around New
England including that year’s Stoner Hands Of Doom festival in CT. With Anthony Cimino(Mojo Studios) and
Clay Neely(Black Coffee Sound), they started work in early 2013 on their newest album "Blooze" which they
released in September 2013.

With Blooze, Skrogg brings more of their southern/classic/blues rock influences while still keeping it heavy and dirty.

Keep on Skroggin'!!

"It's just great fucking gritty hard rock tinged with doom and blues. It's fuzzy and it's huge"Bill Goodman/The Soda Shop
