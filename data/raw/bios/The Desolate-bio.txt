Formed in 2008 by some of the area’s best and most renowned musicians, The Desolate bring their own version of thrash metal to the masses with their latest release “Trapped in Twilight”. Blazing chainsaw riffs via guitarists Nick Bielser, Craig Snipes and bassist Alex Potter blend perfectly with drummer Clayton McDaniel’s fresh approach to thrash metal drumming. Although young, this band proves that age does not determine talent, setting the bar with songs like “T.K. T.K.” and “Spread the Plague”. An aural assault of squealing guitars, pounding bass, and hammering drums, the Desolate is a four man killing machine set to pave its way into the modern day metal scene.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Desolate">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
