Drawing from the landscape of Southeast Alaska, and the influence of the greatest of corpse-painted Scandinavians, Skaltros has defined Alaskan Black Metal, creating 60 minutes of pure terror and beauty.  Imagine the precision and iciness of Pure Holocaust-era Immortal united with the fearful murkiness of Darkthrone's "Transilvanian Hunger," and the epic song structure and ambient craftsmanship of Wolves in the Throne Room.  Sure to satisfy even the snobbiest of BM purists.
