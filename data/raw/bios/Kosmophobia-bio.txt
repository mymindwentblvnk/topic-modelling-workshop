Kosmophobia was born in the early 2007, after the turning of several musicians around the project , the band is finally formed by a stable lineup, where every member is working hard for a common ambitious objective. Kosmophobia wants to bring fresh air in the extreme metal scene, sometimes adopting unconventional solutions, concerning a massive use of electronic inserts and patterns, psy-trance oriented synth leads, atmospheric pads and ethnic instruments, always without loosing fury,anger and ferocity belonging to death/thrash/black metal genres. Kosmophobia attempts to set the listener in a total condition of imagination and suggestion, just riffing, blasting and narrating about events, phenomenons, misteries and cosmic vicissitudes. Kosmophobia is a state of terror and bewilderment, when someone, just looking to the nocturnal sky, might perceive unknow threats coming from the outer space...
