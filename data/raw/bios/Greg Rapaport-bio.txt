Greg Rapaport is a seven-string guitarist whose musical focus is a combination of progressive-metal and jazz-fusion. His music is dark, atmospheric and heavy. Since he has a keen interest in many different genres of music he has over time integrated jazz and funk into his progressive metal foundation. This in turn creates a mix of music that keeps the listener on their toes. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Greg+Rapaport">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
