There is a new producer on the scene as Shuko's entrance into the United States music and marketing arena has come with resounding early success. Shuko has been very busy of late lending his production talents to projects by underground veterans Army of the Pharaohs (Apathy, Vinnie Paz, Celph Titled, 7L & Esoteric and more), as well as projects featuring Bubba Sparxxx, Scales of Nappy Roots, Big Noyd, Doujah Raze, O.C. and more. Recently, he produced the street anthem "Out There," which he recorded with Atlantic recording artist Saigon (HBO's Entourage). This track has been featured on several prominent Mix-Tapes and has received solid radio play across the globe. Shuko has also recently licensed his work for appearance on the successful AND 1 street basketball DVD series including mixtape Volumes 8 & 9, and the special Asian Pacific video. His production can also be heard on a variety of national TV shows including ESPN's Streetball, MTV's Made, and WB's Veronica Mars. 

Shuko hails from Mainz, Germany, a city outside of the Frankfurt metropolis. He is one of Germany's top urban producers having produced top 10 hits for German, French, Austrian, Swiss, and Polish acts. Shuko is now breaking into the U.S. and other markets as a staff producer for Foundation Productions. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Shuko">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
