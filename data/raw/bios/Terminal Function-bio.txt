Originally formed in 1998, guitarist Stefan Aronsson and drummer David Lindkvist decided to form technical metal band Terminal Function with the vision of creating challenging and extreme music.

With the addition of guitarist Mikael Almgren and vocalist Victor Larsson, the vision expanded to a much larger horizon, and they've since found their own unique approach in creating and executing technical metal.

In late 2007, American label Willowtip signed Terminal Function and will be releasing their debutalbum "MEASURING THE ABSTRACT" in November 2008.
