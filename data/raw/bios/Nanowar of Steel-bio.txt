Previously known simply as Nanowar, this Italian band is dedicated to satirizing and making fun of the true-heavy-power metal scene. The decision to change the name of the band was made after Rhapsody renamed themselves to Rhapsody of Fire; according to Nanowar, the new name “better represents the band’s power of the power of the power of the true metal of steel”. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nanowar+of+Steel">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
