Bustre formerly known as Bustrexx is the alias of Buster Charles, a drum & bass producer from Wakefield, UK.

Inspired by artists such as Netsky, Unknown Error, DJ Marky and London Elektricity, Bustre has been bringing the liquid dnb genre since 2009.

Getting support from TwoThirds and Stan SB/Fox Stevenson, Bustre signed his tracks to several record labels, such as "Dirt, Lies & Audio Black", "Monstercat" and "DNBR".

In July 2016, Charles announced that he would quit "Bustre" with a 10 track album, claiming that he lost enjoyment out of creating, and has became stressful. He also said that his songs failed to sell, and he couldn't spend the majority of his time on it. In June 2017, Charles uploaded the track "I Can't See You" to his Bustre soundcloud account, with a link to his new alias, KONKAI. He released his first track as KONKAI in September 2017, a remix of "Prism" by MYLK. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bustre">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
