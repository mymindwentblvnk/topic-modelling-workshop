There are several artists/group who share the name Hooligan. One of them is a Korean rock band.
Here is what Hooligan (훌리건) have to say about themselves on their official site:

These aren’t the hooligans that go crazy over football.
No, these five guys simply share a common passion for music and their music is listed #1 on their crucial list.

They don’t care what the world thinks of them nor do they give any concerns to how others might see them. 
These people, they’re just a group of perhaps simple-minded and perhaps somewhat odd men who go crazy for music. 

They are THE Hooligans.

As long as they’re making and playing their music, they’ve got nothing in the world to fear. 
What’s more, the second you really listen to their music, you’ll be no different from them. 
They may be rough sometimes but then again, there’s no one who can be softer. 
They may sometimes appear to be a monster, but there’s no doubt that there are none who’s more kind-hearted then these people. 


These five guys who react so passionately under the name of music, no questions asked, they are THE Hooligans.

In May 2008 they released their 4th album: "My Sweety".
