Young Jazz Rebels is a Madlib jazz group from the Yesterdays Universe collective that consists of Melvin Hampson, Juggy Lewis, Lena Hamilton, Mary Jane, Brother Dave L, Tyrone Crumb, Lamont Parker, Monk Hughes, and is produced and arranged by Madlib. 

Their debut album, Slave Riot, is an avant-garde free jazz record, a style Madlib has been developing with Young Jazz Rebels since their debut on 2006's Chrome Children compilation with the track "Nino's Deed".

An alternate take of “Nino's Deed” is included on Slave Riot, with 17 others – sounds ranging from heavy rhythm ("The Legend of Mankind") to electro-jazz fusion ("Forces Unseen" and "Black Freedom") to the sparse and experimental heard in the 2-part album centerpiece, “Slaved Riot”. Slaved Riot is inspired primarily by independent and experimental jazz vinyl from the late 60s, 70s and 80s. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Young+Jazz+Rebels">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
