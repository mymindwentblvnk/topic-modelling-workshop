With roots in both catchy and extreme music plus an unhealthy obsession with errors and variation, Goto80 delivers eclectic music based on 8-bit technology. During 15 years he has released hundreds of songs on vinyl, CD’s, cassettes and floppy disks but also for movies, games and art projects. Starting in the demoscene, he gained recognition outside of geek culture in 2001 with the Papaya EP. He’s on a never ending mission to look beyond the video game romantics and explore genres such as ambient, breakcore, country, schlager and jazz, although Goto80 is often recognized for the melodic pop songs. In 2007 he played 40 shows and made 20 releases including the CD-album  Made On Internet.
