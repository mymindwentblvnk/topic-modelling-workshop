It all took form when Nekrokunt, Nekroblaster and Nekroshredder began to tire the lack of raw, raging and intresting music in Sweden. 3 weeks later they all got together and 2 days later "Nekrokraft" was born out of two songs. Nekrokraft will release a full album in the near future. Open the gates, and grind away!
