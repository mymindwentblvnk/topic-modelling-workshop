Christian Walcott Webster (born October 13, 1988), better known by his stage name Chris Webby, is an American rapper from Norwalk, Connecticut. Chris Webby has released many mixtapes such as the DJ Drama-hosted "Bars On Me" and his EP "There Goes the Neighborhood", which peaked at number 101 on the Billboard 200. He has worked with various artists such as Freeway, Mac Miller, Joell Ortiz, Big K.R.I.T., Method Man, Apathy, Prodigy, Bun B, Tech N9ne, Jarren Benton, and Kid Ink. In 2013 he and his label, Homegrown Music, signed a deal with E1 Music. He then released "Homegrown", another EP, in November 2012. Webster released his debut studio album "Chemically Imbalanced" on October 27, 2014.

Webby's mother was a middle school teacher at Nathan Hale Middle School, his father was a guitarist and he was their only child. He started listening to rap at a young age admiring Eminem, he then started writing his own raps in 2000 at age 11. He attended Greens Farms Academy, a private school in Westport, Connecticut.

Webster has differentiated himself from similar acts in the new hip-hop/frat rap genre through his detailed attention to wordplay.  He is recognizable by the high number of tattoos covering his body, most of which pertain to video games (Mortal Kombat, Mario, Boo the Ghost,  etc.) or to aspects of 90's culture (Transformers).

He told AllHipHop in 2013, that he uses Adderall in the studio, which he is prescribed. He explained that he was diagnosed with ADD at a young age and has been on attention medication throughout his life. He says to this day that he has very bad attention deficit disorder.

Webster's devoted fans are know as "Ninjas." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Chris+Webby">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
