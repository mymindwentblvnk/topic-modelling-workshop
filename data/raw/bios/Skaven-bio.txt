There is more than one artist with this name.

1)  Skaven were a bunch of wild crusty hobo blackmetal punks from "back in the day" (before the new wave of junkies took over â€¦). They were heavily influence by the ol UK stenchcore bands (ala Axegrinder, Amebix, Antisect, and the like) but also had traits of 90's bands like Antischism, Nausea, etc. Anyone who had a chance to see them during their hayday would most likely recall beer, drugs, members of the band on fire, vomit, band members attacking other members of the band, a skinhead getting his ear bitten off, dreadlocks, and other crusty debauchery, sans the "got any change?" routine.

2)  Skaven (otherwise known as Peter Hajba) is a computer music artist and was one of the musicians of the demo group Future Crew. The group produced many acclaimed demos, including the ground breaking "Second Reality". Skaven himself has received several awards for his music and won the Assembly music competition in 1993, 1995 and 2002. He is perhaps best known for his composition of music for the games Unreal Tournament and Uplink - though other works include Bejeweled, Warblade and GLtron.
