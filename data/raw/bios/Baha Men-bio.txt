Baha Men is the name of a pop group that plays both an updated style of native Bahamian music called Junkanoo as well as crossover popular music. The group's debut, 'Junkanoo', was released in 1992, and it was very traditional in its sound. They soon began aiming their music at a more mainstream pop and dance music audience, however, and the Baha Men finally succeeded in breaking through with their 2000 remake of "Who Let the Dogs Out?", originally composed by Anslem Douglas.

That track won a Grammy Award and became an international 40 hit in many countries while also being featured in several films. Later singles with significant airplay include "You All Dat", "Move It Like This", and "Best Years of Our Lives" among others. Yet their commercial fortunes came in fits and starts after the 2002 album 'Move It Like This'. While barely releasing any more material, they toured often during the past decade, finally becoming a dormant project over the past several years as its members pursued other endeavors. This changed in October 2015 when a rejuvenated group released the album 'Ride With Me'.
