The "Possession" began in the early days of death metal and thrash. Inspired by bands such as Celtic Frost, Mercyful Fate, Destruction, Voivod, Bathory, and Slayer, plus earlier metal bands like Black Sabbath and Iron Maiden, founding members Glyn Clark and Steve Jacobs, in 1987, set out to forge a metal sound of their own. In 1993, Diabolic Possession released the "Ripped To Pieces" E.P. It was later released on CD by Ground Zero Entertainment. "Ripped To Pieces" consisted of the songs "Ripped to Pieces", "Reign of Terror", "Cranial Miasis", and "From the Gates of Hell". They later recorded a full-length album "Return to the Grave". The album showed the musical growth of the band. "Return to the Grave" included the songs Sarcophagus, The Other One, Torn Off Fingernails, The Possession, Exhumed, The Second Coming Of Christ, and The Desolate One. Unfortunately, it was never released.

The band will appear on the Sabbat (Japan) tribute album soon.
