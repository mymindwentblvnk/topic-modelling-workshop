The idea of Sakramentum had long existed in Coa`s mind, but finally came to life one winter`s day, when Coa met Truca. Both known as great musicians, they decided to start a mutual project-and so Sakramentum was finally born in the misty Serbian mountains at the beginning of 2011. Soon after, the remaining members joined and started to work as a band. Songs were created, and the story was ready to be told. Our music is very melodic black metal, with heavy riffs, fast drums, both growl and scream vocals, and lots of orchestral and choir keyboard elements in it. The lyrical content is focused mostly about our great ancient past, and ancestors, but also about the many modern problems and struggles we are faced with.
