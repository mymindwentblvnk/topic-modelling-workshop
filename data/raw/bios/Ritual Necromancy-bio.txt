Ritual Necromancy is a Death Metal band from the United States, Portland, Oregon, formed in 2008. They released one demo "Demo 2009", and a full lenght album on November 15th, 2011 "Oath of the Abyss". Like the wicked child of Vorum, Incantation, and Antediluvian, Ritual Necromancy's "Oath of the Abyss" rips through the darkness with a muddy chainsaw guitar/bass tone from the former (or Denial) and oppressive, frighteningly deep and formless vocals of the latter. Lots of dark, creeping and doomy mid-paced tremolo riffs with chunky chords interspersed throughout the record over the annihilating, merciless drums. Oath of the Abyss provides nothing but satisfying, unstoppable old school tomb-defiling death metal. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ritual+Necromancy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
