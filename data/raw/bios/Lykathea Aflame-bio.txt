Lykathea Aflame is a progressive/technical brutal death metal band from Prague, Czech Republic. Through 1995-1999 the band was originally known as Appalling Spawn and released a full-length entitled "Freedom, Hope & Fury (The Second Spawn)" in 1998. A year later, they changed their name to Lykathea Aflame and released their only album, Elvenefris in 2000. In addition they recorded different versions of the tracks "To Give" and "Shine of Consolation" for Obscene Extreme sampler discs, and they were included on a re-release of Elvenefris in 2011.

The main man behind Lykathea Aflame, Petr Tománek (aka Ptoe), brought in drummer Tomás Corn (formerly of Garbage Disposal) and some of Czech Republic's finest musicians to craft Elvenefris. After it was released, the band broke up in 2002.

In autumn 2002 the band changed their name to Lykathé and planned to release new material under that name in late 2006, but this never materialized at least partially due to the fact that Petr "Ptoe" Tománek had forfeited vocal duties and the band were searching for a new vocalist. 

Tomás Corn announced at some point afterward that he was forced to quit playing drums due to neurological problems in his foot, though as of today he is still active as a drummer in several other bands. 

On November 2009 Tomás mentioned: "We just started to work on new album yesterday (after many years of "sleeping")". The current status of the band is officially active, though it is unknown if new material will be released under the name "Lykathé" or "Lykathea Aflame". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lykathea+Aflame">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
