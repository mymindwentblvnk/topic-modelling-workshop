Fenomenon, originally consisting of Kjetil Ingebretsen and Håvard Rosenberg, hails from Stavanger on the west coast of Norway. In 2000, they signed with London label Nuphonic, and released two critically acclaimed EP's, making Fenomenon a household name in the international nujazz/downbeat scene. Their debut album for Beatservice Records, "Hourglass", featured a new side of Fenomenon, with it’s electronica oriented broken beats, while the second album In Stereo leaned more towards the soul/funky side. The tracks from the debut EP’s was then finally compiled into the Pacific Memories album. After three years with three albums on a row, things suddenly turned quiet from the Fenomenon camp.

4 years in the making, the new Fenomenon album is now finally ready to see the light of day. The duo turned trio, with the addition of drummer/producer Ruben Dalen, has spent what seems like a decade in the studio writing and refining the self titled album. The ultimate goal was to create a feel and a mix of the two vibes Fenomenon is; movie inspired scores and pop/electronica.
