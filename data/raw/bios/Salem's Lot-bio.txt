They formed in early 2008 out of the ashes of several local bands, and have continued to impress the youth of Jersey with their high energy blazing rock and roll. July 2008 saw the release of their first EP and their victory in a Battle of the Bands leading to a set at the local music festival “Rock in the Park”. The rest of 2008 saw more gigs from Salem’s Lot and an unprecedented rise in popularity. They were asked to open for Guernsey legends Nemesis and play at the Chaos festival in Guernsey for their first overseas show.  June 2009 led to the release of the very first full length album titled “The Trials of 2009" The summer saw Salem’s Lot reach even greater hieghts when they came 2nd in the local Battle of the Bands. Things have never looked better for Salem's Lot, with gigs planned later in the year in Guernsey and London, plus the release of their next album, 2010 is sure to be one hell of a year for Salem's Lot!
