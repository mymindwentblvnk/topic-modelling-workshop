Indigent originated in Summer 2002 while Richard was on holiday in Spain as a means of entertainment during the intensely hot daytime, when moving around wasn't really a sensible option. Starting as a death/grind band, the music quickly evolved into its current form, mixing a death metal base with elements of doom and black metal, rhythmic experimentation and a strong sense of melody to create a unique atmosphere. It has remained a solo project, though many of the lyrics are contributed by Bleakmage.

Indigent released a 5 track demo CD at the end of February 2004, which received numerous extremely positive reviews. The new Indigent CD, "Simulacrum", was recorded between January 2005 and January 2006. It contains 9 songs and showcases a more mature sound with increased influence from doom and black metal, while retaining the original Indigent atmosphere.

Indigent released a single, "Bestial", at Wacken festival 2006. It was distributed for free for promotional purposes. It features a new song, "Bestial", as well as "Voice From The Head" and "Ages Past Weeping" from the "Simulacrum" album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Indigent">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
