There is more than one artist with this name.

1) Division S is an experimental neofolk and post-industrial band from Italy. Their music can in some cases be compared to that of bands like Nový Svět and Teatro Satanico.

2) Division S was a White Nationalist Viking Rock band active in Sweden during the mid-1990's. They have released at least one single, two albums, and featured on a number of compilations. Their debut single and first album had strong racial and anti-semitic lyrics with an early heavy viking rock sound, but in their 2nd album the band is playing with early dark metal sounds, and the lyrics have suddenly veered away from politics and taken a very reflective stance, undoubtedly loosing them many of their original fans.
