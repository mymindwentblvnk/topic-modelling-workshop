Cruadalach is an Czech - Celtic / Folk / Metal - band which formed in 2008 in Prague, Czech Republic. 
The band style is "Evocation of ancient spirits" and is based on  waters and hills,  pagan gods,  history,  mysteries,  esoterism,  folk music,  fairy-tales.

CRUADALACH was founded by Michal Rak, ex-drummer of Czech most popular doom metal band Silent Stream of Godless Elegy in 2008. He thought about creating mix between metal and medieval music like ten years before this step, but the right impulse came when he met Ales Cipra from Return To Innocence. CRUADALACH’s final line-up for gigs was done on holidays 2009 and soon the band had it’s first tour, side by side with Dissolving of Prodigy, old Czech doom metal cult. Then the band worked on new songs, played some more gigs and on January 2010 it created it’s first promo "V rytmu stare krve" (In Rhythm of Old Blood) which is freely distributed through web. CRUADALACH is now getting ready for it’s debut CD and preparing next, much bigger tour with 12 gigs in Czech republic and Slovakia. Still wandering for chances to play abroad and every kind of promotion which is possible...

Jan "Radalf" Vrobel - vocals
