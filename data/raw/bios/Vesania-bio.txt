Vesania is a Polish Symphonic Black Metal/blackened death metal band featuring Orion (Behemoth) and Daray (ex-Vader, Dimmu Borgir). The word "Vesania" is from Latin, referring to everything that is connected with madness, insanity, dementia and mental disease. 

The band was formed in Legionowo, Poland in 1997. Their first album "Moonastray" was a split with Black Altar and was released in 2002 by Odium Records exclusively in Poland, the release was limited to 666 copies and each album was signed with blood. 2003 saw the release of their second album "Firefrost Arcanum" through Empire Records across all of Europe. Their 2005 album "God the Lux"  also differs quite a lot from their past releases. While "Firefrost Arcanum" is more of the brutal black metal type, the band changed their style with "God The Lux", which is musically heavier and more symphonic.

Their latest release "Distractive Killusions" was released in 2007 by Napalm Records. The album further explores their symphonic yet still heavy blackened death metal sound. The album pushes the boundaries of run of the mill symphonic black metal and creates a fusion of many genres, achieving the band's most mature release to date.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vesania">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
