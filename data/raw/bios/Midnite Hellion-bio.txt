MIDNITE HELLION is a Heavy Metal quintet from Trenton, NJ. Blending a healthy mixture of Heavy Metal and Thrash Metal with a touch of Progressive Metal, vocalist Sonny Zackeo, guitarists Dan Sclavi and Mario DiBartolo, bassist Bill Dripps, and drummer Drew Rizzo create an addictive, crushing sound that's ready to take the world by storm. They released their demo, "The Fever," on Thursday, November 17th as a limited hand-numbered edition of 100 copies, which have nearly sold out within two weeks of the release. They will be releasing their debut EP through Evil Jester Media tentatively in the Spring of 2012.

MIDNITE HELLION has had the honor of sharing the stage with many national acts in the NYC/NJ/PA Tri-State Area, such as Whiplash, Obituary, Deceased, Denial Fiend, Morbid Saint, Warbringer, Mobile Deathcamp, Lazarus A.D., Diamond Plate, Landmine Marathon, and Swashbuckle, just to name a few.
