Stunning industrial rock with a gothic twist from Anglo-German quartet LAHANNYA. For Fans of Lacuna Coil, Marilyn Manson and The Birthday Massacre. 

Frontwoman and gothic icon Lahannya became first known as a solo artist with the release of her debut EP “Drowning”, drawing comparisons to the likes of Throwing Muses and Cocteau Twins. She soon became a sought-after guest vocalist, appearing on releases by Soman, Combichrist, Greenhaus and more recently ASP to name but a few.

In 2005 Lahannya began her collaboration with Lutz Demmler with whom she recorded her debut album “Shotgun Reality”, an unconventional marriage of alternative rock and dark electro. Lutz also became part of the live line-up, which was completed with the addition of Belle on drums and Chris Milden on guitar. The glamorous Anglo-German quartet have been touring extensively ever since with artists such as Emilie Autumn, ASP and Moon Kana.

In spring 2008 Lahannya released their follow-up EP “Welcome To The Underground”, which marked the beginning of a new era for the band: not only had their sound evolved into industrial rock infused with plenty of metal attitude, thematically it introduced the world of the Underground, a haven for misfits and nonconformists ostracised from the surveillance society that rules with an iron fist overground.

This brave new Britain and its opposition from the Underground will continue to be the setting for Lahannya’s second album “Defiance”, which is going to be the band’s darkest and most aggressive sounding release to date. “Defiance” will be released in October 2009 on Kabuki.
