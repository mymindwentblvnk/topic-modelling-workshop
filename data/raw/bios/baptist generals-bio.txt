The Baptist Generals are an American indie band from the music town of Denton, Texas.

The Baptist Generals was formed in 1998 by songwriter/guitarist Chris Flemmons and drummer Steve Hill. Originally the two played together as a street act, but over the years the band has grown to include a rotating cast of Denton and former Denton musicians with Flemmons and Hill figuring central to every new arrangement.

The band has a short list of releases that include a 9-song EP, Dog released in 1998 on now-defunct Quality Park Records, as well as the LP No Silver/No Gold released in 2003 on Subpop Records.
