Chemistry Room was born on september 2008 from an idea of Fabrizio Amilcare (guitar), Dario Battiston (bass) and Gilberto Miglioranza (vocal). As Stefano Gasparotto (drums) and Piercarlo Favro (lead guitar) joined the band, we started making rumors with some gigs.

Live dates we are proud to remember are at New Age Club - Roncade (TV), Tetris (TS), Deposto Giordani (PN) and Festintenda 2009 - Mortegliano (UD) (the same festival where Testament played one years before). Ready to record our first full lenght, we completed the line up with Vittorio Manzan on keyboards in order to create a different sound.

The band offers songs characterized by aggressive guitar riffs, huge harmonies from classical music and powerful and melodic lead vocals. On July 2009 band enters in Remaster Studio (VI) and record his first album named “Butterfly Effect” containing nine tracks.
Travis Smith (Opeth, Nevermore, Iced Earth covers) created the artwork and Max Valerio took pictures for the booklet. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Chemistry+Room">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
