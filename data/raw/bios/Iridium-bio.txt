There seems to be more than one artist using the alias "Iridium"

1) Iridium is a producer based in Albany, New York, mostly favoring various electronic music genres. Clean Vs Dirty, a melodic IDM/DnB track, was one of the demo tracks on FL Studio 7.  Iridium also has a release on FL Studio 8, a trance remix of Blake Reary's Hanging On.
Iridium also has a release on John Galt Entertainment, a remix of rock artist Lennon's track Where Do I Fit In.  This was as a result of being a winner of a remix competition on the online music community SectionZ, and the remix is available on iTunes.
