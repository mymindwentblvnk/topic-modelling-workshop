Being the "artist", here's what NOT to use as "similar" as a description. ANY pathetic political Crust or Grindcore type bands. Warhate NEVER associated with weakling politics Left or Right. Warhate was NOT a Grindcore band. Warhate WAS a Death Metal band, plain and simple. If you're ignorant enough to not listen to the music and lump it in with the plastic, hollow, empty rhetoric spouting Grindcore or Crust scene just because it was released on a split with Nasum, then you're a retard.

What were influences for the Warhate sound? Possessed, Sarcofago & Blasphemy just to name a few. Take that influence, speed it up a notch, and you have Warhate. Inspired by early 80's Thrash Metal and late 80's Death Metal. None too hard to hear.

In total contempt,
