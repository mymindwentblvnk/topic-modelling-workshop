Darkel is one half of the French, electronic music duo Air. Otherwise known as Jean-Benoit Dunckel, his solo album was released on 19th September 2006 in America, and one day earlier in the UK. According to Dunckel (or Darkel) himself, "Most of the tracks contain some piano, and the chords are on the black keys most of the time, because I like the sound of that." Of the 10 tracks (or 11 depending on the version of the album) two are instrumentals. The first single At The End Of The Sky is available on iTunes, and the album also includes the songs TV Destroy and My Own Sun. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Darkel">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
