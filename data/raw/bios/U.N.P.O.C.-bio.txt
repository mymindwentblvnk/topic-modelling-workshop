U.N.P.O.C. is Tom Bauchop, a Scottish singer-songwriter with a lo-fi musical style that has been described as "somewhere between field recording-era Roky Erickson and a stripped down but no less ludicrously gifted Brian Wilson".  The artist’s recording name is an acronym with a variable meaning, one of which is the nautical term "unable to navigate, probably on course".  U.N.P.O.C.’s debut album, Fifth Column, was released in October 2003 by Domino Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/U.N.P.O.C.">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
