Rachel K Collier is a singer / songwriter born in Swansea, Wales. Having spent her early years singing in a choir, writing songs on her piano and layering vocals with her Dad’s old double deck tape player, Rachel grew up surrounded by music. Discovering the joys of programming beats on a Yamaha DJX keyboard, coupled with a taste for Club Culture (starting at a very early age!), Rachel developed a love for dance music which laid the foundations for her current sounds.

Rachel moved to Cardiff in 2006 and spent the next 4 years creating music, beats, sound effects and designing sounds on the Creative Music Technology course at The Royal Welsh College of Music. A self taught pianist, Rachel took her grade 8 piano while at college and funded herself through her studies by teaching others how to play.

Rachel moved to London to further pursue her music career and has since been writing for others as well as developing her own sound. To date her writing credits include tracks for Groove Addix, Defected Records, Netsky, Mutated Forms, Wookie, Lung, Ray Foxx, Mat Zo, Anjuna Beats, Blokhe4d, Hospital Records/Med School Records and Team Saatchi. Off the back of producing 2 demos for Team Saatchi, Rachel’s performance of a Jimmy Cliff classic, “Hard Road To Travel” was featured in a national televised ad campaign.

Rachel can be heard featuring on the track “2 Us” from legendary producer Wookie, which is currently picking up Radio 1 and 1xtra plays from the likes of Annie Mac, Mistajam and Skream and Benga. She also provides vocals on tracks for Drum and Bass producer Lung released on revered drum ‘n’ bass label Hospital Records sister label, Med School. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rachel+K+Collier">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
