The Genevieves are James Poulton, Andrew McTaggart and Stephanie Townsley. Working from their studio on the outskirts of Edinburgh the three began working on their first album 'Cliches Are Such a Bore' in 2007 (Stephanie was still at school at this point and therefore had to take breaks from recording to complete exams and stuff). Drawing from many influences and with Stephanies ear for melody and stunning voice, the three work together to create songs that, like most songwriters, they simply enjoy listening too. Thanks for taking the time to  listen to the songs, it's very much appreciated. The album 'Cliches Are Such a Bore' should be available in shops and stuff in the next wee while (at long last). Thanks Again for popping by. XXXX 

"Another great song and wonderfully arranged. I love the chord structure behind the melody and the sections to the song work very creatively whilst still maintaining the hook. Great stuff!" - (Review of 'Genevieve')-Imorrorshow

"This is really good. I mean REALLY good....Push ahead. You deserve it." -RAGPICKER


"I like this a lot, The overall sound is great, and I like the vocal a great deal....this is brilliant, and has hit potential!" - KEN MORRISON - Meermusic
