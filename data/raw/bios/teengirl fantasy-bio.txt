Following up their sophomore LP Tracer from August 2012, Teengirl Fantasy put out their newest EP "Nun" in November 2013 as a teaser to their 3rd album set to drop later in 2014. The EP did not feature any vocalists as some of their past works have. Consisting of four tracks, Nun showcased their ability to mix different genres while staying true to their original free-form sound. The EP is reminiscent of Teengirl Fantasy's earlier works while stepping into new territory and giving insight into where their sound is heading for their forthcoming third full-length.  
While students at Oberlin College, Nick Weiss and Logan Takahashi connected over a shared love of classic house and techno records that prompted them to make, "some kind of dance music that wasn't just emulating what we were hearing." The duo formed their music organically, improvising over loops that eventually materialized into full-fledged compositions. Rather than relying on triggering loops, or quantization, Teengirl Fantasy's music has always been performed and composed live, resulting in a form of discourse between the band and their instruments. The result is a-typical for electronic dance music- colorful, maximalist textures and tones that move along with a driving rhythm yet still retain a distinctly human and emotional core. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Teengirl+Fantasy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
