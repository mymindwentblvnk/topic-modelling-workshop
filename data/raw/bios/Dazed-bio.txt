There is more than one artist with this name:

1) Dazed is one half of Canberra/Sydney/Melbourne based Hip-Hop duo, Dazed & Flawlezz.

As if taking things just a little too literally, the concept think global, act local has been somewhat hyperbolised by Dazed & Flawlezz. The Sydney based MC duo extend their dogma to think cosmic, and act everywhere. Dazed & Flawlezz aren't just rappers - together are producers, players, poets and presenters. Beats are created, manipulated, sampled and looped in their house daily; experiences, concerns and hopes are translated to harmonically overlayed rhythmic devices, and laid on top to create fresh, sublimely produced hip hop bangers, complete with a seasoned sentiment and respect all too often lacking in groups still this young. An undeniable force for the positive, and one not too proud to collaborate with those in their circle, from hip hop and crunk, to drum and bass and punk, Dazed and Flawlezz have been getting noticed about the place. 

From getting coveted support slots on the Def Jux tour that featured underground legends Cage and Mr Lif, they have also supported a wide range of acts fitting in seamlessly with DJs, Bands and live acts at the legendry Green Beats parties in the Sydney summer, as well a famously barnstorming opening for alterna-folk heroes Conrad Lens and the Spirits of the Dead, their malleability, attitude and quality of songs make them welcome everywhere, all the time.
