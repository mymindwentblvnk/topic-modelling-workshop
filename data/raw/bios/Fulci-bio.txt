Formed in: 2013, Italy, Caserta, Campania. We were born in 2014 publishing our first demo tape. Since the beginning, Fulci was intended to be a death metal tribute to the master of gore Lucio Fulci. 

In 2015 we released our first album “Opening The Hell Gates”, based on the movie “City of the Living Dead”.
Our live show includes visual, film audio samples, synth and when possible also lights to create a theatrical scenario. We use a drum machine (for choice), audio samples from the movies and synth. In 2019 we had a tour in Western U.S to promote the new album: “Tropical Sun”, dedicated to the cult movie “Zombi 2”. We also also played at the Las Vegas Death Fest 2019.

We combined the two things we love: death metal and Lucio Fulci horror movies. Each album we release is a death metal tribute to one of his movies.

Our musical influences are: New York / Tampa Bay death metal (Immolation, Incantation, Cannibal Corpse,  Gore metal (Mortician, Necrophagia) Slam (Internal Bleeding, Devourment) and composers (F. Frizzi, F. Micalizzi, S. Cipriani, J. Carpenter). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fulci">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
