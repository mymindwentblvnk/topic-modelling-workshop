Idea of a band was born in somewhere around the year 1996, when few metalheads were only 16 years old. In year 2003 band started to develope a little bit more seriously, when these three metalheads (Niilola, Kousa and Parviainen) finally started to play together songs, which had been made during these past years. Kousa had done few thrashmetal songs and they decided start to play in this genre, which also was in favour of all band members. These guys played this way until the year 2005 bass player Ukkonen joined the band. In this same year these four metalheads started to practice more seriously and Parviainen started to bring forward his composition ideas too.

In the beginning of the year 2006 MADNESS Co. finally got their other lead guitarist (Vesa Kääpä) and they finally were whole as a band. Two weeks after Kääpä joined in to the band MADNESS Co. went to the studio and spend time there for couple of weekends. Big credits to Vesa that he learned all MADNESS Co. songs and brought his new ideas to the band in so little time. 2006 we finally found our singer ( Sami Kujala) who also went straight in to a studio and did the final touch to our very first demo which is now ready and we are ready to share it to your ears. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Madness+CO.">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
