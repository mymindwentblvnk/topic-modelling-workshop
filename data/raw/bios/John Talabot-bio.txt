John Talabot is a youngster from Barcelona, Spain with a rather special way of approaching music. His influences range from flamenco to northern soul, from African music to traditional Asian songs.

His first commercial effort on German label Permanent Vacation included the A side "Afrika" plus another two tracks,"Naomi” and “Korlee” . Shortly after (June 2009), "Sunshine" debuted via Talabot's own label Hivern. 

"Sunshine" resurfaced on a limited blue vinyl with mixes by Delorean and Blondes (May 2010) after the original made it to Pitchfork's best new music of their 2009 list. At the same time Permanent Vacation launched his second release for the label: “Matilda’s Dream” 

2011 saw the release of a four track EP, "Families", via Young Turks. The title track features vocals by Glasser.

His first artist album, "ƒin", was released in 2012 and it contained eleven new tracks, featuring Pional and Ekhi.

In 2013 a DJ Kicks album compiled by Talabot was released. It contained two new Talabot tracks, "Without You" and "Sideral", a collaboration with Axel Boman.
