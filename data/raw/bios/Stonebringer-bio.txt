Stonebringer is a four-piece heavy rock band from Piraeus, Greece. 
Being lovers of heavy sound and influenced by bands like Clutch, Down, Pink Floyd and Black Sabbath, their music features stoner metal and progressive rock instrumentations, creating a unique sonic identity.

Despite their young age, Stonebringer’s strong songwriting and their explosive gigs have made them stand out as a very promising group. From the very start, they shared the stage with highly acclaimed Greek bands, while they got to play twice on Schoolwave Festival. 

Following their independent promo release “Born To Jam On The Streets" (2011), Stonebringer are currently working on a new EP, entitled “Ocean Of The Brave”, along with the legendary music producer Chris Tsangarides (Judas Priest, Black Sabbath, Thin Lizzy etc.). “Ocean Of The Brave” is a four track concept EP, expected to be released by the end of 2012. 
When Chris Tsangarides was asked to describe Stonebringer in three words his answer was overwhelming…: “Fuckin' Heavy Metal“! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Stonebringer">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
