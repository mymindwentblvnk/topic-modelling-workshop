Emmersed in a black metal band originally formed in 2007 under the name "Immersed." A Canadian band by the same name existed so the 'E' was changed to make the two bands more distinct. The original band members included Taylor Nordberg, William Scott, Andrew Lentz, and Lucien Ryan, though because of schedule conflicts, Andrew Lentz, and Lucien Ryan haven't been active in the band. Calvin Morooney and Andrew Huffard play live music with the band, and may appear on the next EP. Emmersed's music draws a lot of influence from oldschool and newer black metal. It's a very good mix of classic and contemporary. The album "Howl of the Northern Winds," was released in 2008, and the follow up double album (Dawn of Kaos/Enthralled by the Black Forest) was released on Oct. 29, 2011.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Emmersed">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
