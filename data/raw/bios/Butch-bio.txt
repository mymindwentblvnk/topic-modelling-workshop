There are more artists using this name:

1) Butch is a DJ, producer and remixer. As soon as he steps behind the decks or into his studio his only ambition is to find the perfect sound which transforms the dancefloor into an ecstatic crowd. His unique productions and remixes transcends between Neo-Trance, Techno and Minimal and are defined through their high quality sound productions and the trademark sounds, which have enabled him to release productions on renowned labels such as Great Stuff, Craft Music, BluFin and Stil vor Talent (Oliver Koletzki’s label).

His first production for Craft Music, an impulsive remix for Whebba’s production “Mary’s Army” found world-wide recognition with Key-DJs and fans of electronic music. Shortly afterwards his first own single followed for Tomcraft’s label entitled “Life is Deadly”. This production found support with DJ greats such as Deep Dish, John Acquaviva, Benny Benassi and Oliver Koletzki.

Already mastered is his follow-up for Great Stuff called “On the Line” which boasts remixes by Oxia, Pig & Dan and Swen Weber, which presumably will be released in September 2007. His newest project is a remix for probably one of the most wanted producers of minimal-techno at the moment. Stay tuned…
