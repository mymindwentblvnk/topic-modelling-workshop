Mattiel Brown is a singer and songwriter based in Atlanta, GA., United States.

After moving to Atlanta, Mattiel developed a palette for more diverse musical interests. She developed her vocal style over the course of several years, often alone in her car on long drives to work. She ventured into songwriting after meeting Randy Michael and Jonah Swilley in 2014. 

As the group began producing more material, a full length album was written and recorded in a span of nine months (not unlike the gestation period of a human baby). Their process was simple: Michael and Swilley supplied instrumental compositions and handed them over to Mattiel for lyrical content and melodies. The Mattiel LP was released in September 2017 on Burger Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mattiel">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
