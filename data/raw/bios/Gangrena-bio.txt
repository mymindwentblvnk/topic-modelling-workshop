There are a few bands named "Gangrena". 

One of them is Polish HC/punk band. They released albums: "Oczy mrówki", "Gangrena", "Ślad człowieka".

Another band with this name started when two other bands merged in 1992.
In 1993 the band recorded their first demo tape with a new vocalist; the '93 promo tape had 3 tracks which were later included in their debut album "Infected Ideologies".
The band then toured playing with big acts such as Carcass, Pungent Stench, Brutal Truth, Macabre, etc.
Meanwhile, drummer Alexandre Oliveira had left the band and was replaced by Ricardo Jorge.
The track "Beguiled" was about to be recorded for a compilation (From Here to Nowhere).
Guitarrist Valter Mateus left the band and the other four continued playing as a quartet.
Soon this changed when Nuno Santos joined in as lead guitarrist.
A change of cenary was to anticipate the end of the band.
After playing in the Netherlands Gangrena called it quits when the return to Portugal seemed like the wrong thing to do.
João Santos and João Ricardo still play together in Boiar. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gangrena">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
