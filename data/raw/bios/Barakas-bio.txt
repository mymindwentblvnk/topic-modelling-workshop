Barakas is Simon “Bonobo” Green’s Mr.-Hyde-like pseudonym, allowing him to delve further into deep jazz, hip-hop, drum n bass, break beat, funk and soul to move dancefloors worldwide. 

Whilst his live band have been wowing crowds with their performances of Bonobo’s beautiful melodic songs and soundscapes, Simon Green’s DJ sets have developed into an impressive, eclectic mix of the deep jazz, hip-hop, drum n bass, break beat, funk and soul.

This development helped lead to the birth of Barakas, when Simon teamed up with Tru Thoughts A&R Robert Luis to create their dancefloor side-project under the aliases Nirobi & Barakas. 
After producing a few tracks to be played in their DJ sets, the pair were inundated with requests and decided to release the Bungee Jump Against Racism 12” on Tru-Thoughts. 

Following on from this success, Barakas is continuing to knock out some, as he describes it, ‘dance floor wobbly goodness’ whilst retaining elements of the mellow, organic melodies and rhythmic intricacies of his unique Bonobo sound. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Barakas">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
