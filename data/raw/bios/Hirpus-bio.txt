Hirpus is a black metal band from Rome, Italy formed in 2001. Their lyrics are focused on roman and pagan themes. After two demos in 2002 and 2004 they released one album titled "Ianuaria" in 2005. Hirpus was the name used by a group of warrior priests living on the Soratte mountain in the ancient times, devoted to mystical practices. The word is Oscan for "wolf", an animal closely related to Mars in ancient Italic religions.
