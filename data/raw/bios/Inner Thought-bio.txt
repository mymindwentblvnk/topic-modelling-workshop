Inner Thought was a death metal band formed in Canada in 1989 by Bobby Sadzak . Their style was mostly typical mid-tempo death metal but incorporated the use of a drum machine as well as some sampling, lending a bit of an industrial sound at times. Female vocal passages were also present on some songs, contributed by a studio singer.

They released two albums, Worldly Separation (1994) and Perspectives (1996), both on Dwell Records. The band was also featured on Dwell's In Memory of Celtic Frost compilation, performing a cover of Morbid Tales.
