Thy Withering Orchard were an atmospheric blackened Death/Doom band from The Netherlands.  They released one demo, entitled "Promo 1997", and one full length, entitled "Soft Glow of Perishing Cold", via Amenta/Hammerheart Records in 1999.  

Their music is mostly slow/mid paced, similar to older Paradise Lost.  They utilize both clean and grim vocals.  After releasing their full length they split up.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Thy+Withering+Orchard">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
