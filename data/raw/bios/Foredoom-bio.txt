Foredoom is coming from Medan, Indonesia. Formed in the year 02...between now and then,several member changes occured in the band...the concept is to pull together the essential melody and beat from progressive music with everything that is related to grinding the fuck out from death,math,and technical metal-hardcore. the post-production sessions of the ep "re-constructed" were still in progress and will be launch hopefully sometimes between the end of year 07. meanwhile,the band is still in process of writing materials for the full album <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Foredoom">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
