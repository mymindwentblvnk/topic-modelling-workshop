there are many bands under the name "Tortured"

1)Tortured are a 5 piece canberra based death metal band that has grown in canberra from late 2006. With the first live performance not untill 2008, gave them 2yrs to write the songs that would make a dramatic impact on the australian metal scene. Since then Tortured have decimated the stage along side some of Australia's finest metal acts. Tortured released copies of their demo early 2009 and only made 500 copies which were sold out very quickly. Tortured are currently in the studio recording the debut full length album. Titled A LESSON IN HOLOCAUST. None of the songs featured on the demo of 2009 will appear on the debut full length album. With a new stage show and more brutal songs on the way tortured are definatley a death metal band to watch out for.
