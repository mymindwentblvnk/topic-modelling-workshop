Built on the ruins of a rotten society, INFERNOTION is the embodiment of resignation and frustration. However, the songs are more than just pure raging grimness combined with decadent stupidity. What you hear is intense emotion, which is generated by having a close look at this sick place where we are living a.k.a. planet earth. But even the music of INFERNOTION is exposed to human abyss. No one can escape. The madness is uncontrollable and all around us. You have to abandon. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Infernotion">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
