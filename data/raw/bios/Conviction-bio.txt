There are multiple bands with the name Conviction:

1) A band that bridged the gap between hardcore's urgency/ideals and metal's precision/brutality, Pennsylvania's Conviction goes down as one of the most influential underground straight edge metalcore bands of the early 90's.

Featuring ex and current members of: Earth Crisis, Turmoil, Starkweather, Believer, and The Promise

2) Conviction, hardcore from High Wycombe

3) Conviction as a band emerged in autumn 2006. The band was formed by a drummer Nikola and a bass player Karchi with an desire to play energetic metalcore. Soon enough evil Milosh joins the band as a vocal and Silvester as the guitar. The band does some serious work and after a period of couple of months records its first song. Afterwards, Karchi leaves the band and a longer pause takes place due to the search for a bass player replacement. After some time, new bass player, Bojan, and second guitar player Borko join the band and things start working out. We create about 30 minutes of repertoire and play our first gig in Sombor. More gigs start happening all over Novi Sad and Vojvodina. After a year, the band changes its bass player again and Milosh's evil brother Dushan takes Bojan's place. His entrance into the band results in more active and productive work of the band as a whole. New gigs are being scheduled and our first EP IS OUT NOW. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Conviction">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
