The Lemon Twigs are an American pop/rock band from Long Island, New York, United States, fronted by brothers Brian D’Addario and Michael D’Addario. They both write and perform, they are joined for live performance by Megan Zeankowski on bass and Danny Ayala on keyboards and backing vocals.

The Times characterized The Lemon Twigs as "a modern-day band combining the melodic, harmony-rich soft rock of Wings and Supertramp, the underground cool of Big Star and the Ramones, and the theatricality of Broadway musicals." The Guardian cited the "humbling beauty of their songs" and their "sumptuous harmonies."

The band was signed to legendary British alternative music label 4AD in 2015. Their debut album, Do Hollywood, was released in October of 2016 to widespread critical acclaim. A number of iconic pop music figures have publicly expressed admiration for the Twigs, among them Elton John, The Zombies, Boy George, Laura Marling, Gilbert O'Sullivan, and Gary Brooker of Procol Harum. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Lemon+Twigs">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
