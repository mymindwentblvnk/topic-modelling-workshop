Originally formed in 1997, Numen is an extreme music band coming from the Basque Country. They play black metal with some influences of the folk and traditional music of their land. All lyrics are written in Euskera (Basque), their mother tongue, and they tell about old traditions, legends and mythology, always with a strong feeling against Christianity.
By late 1999 they record the first studio MCD "Haize sorginduen intziriak" with 5 black metal tracks. In 2001 Numen release their first full lenght CD "Galdutako itxaropenaren eresia", a more extreme recording based on Basque legends and history, as well as its dark and magic mythology. At the beginning of 2003 "...jarrai beza kondairak" sees the light, a MCD which compiles 4 new tracks , and the previously sold out MCD "Haize sorginduen intziriak" as bonus.

May 2004, the band returns once again with "Basoaren semeak" , an extreme piece of basque black metal. Already in 2007, celebrating its 10 th anniversary, Numen returns with the release of its third full-length called "Numen‚Äù. Fast old school BM from the basque woods, following the path of the ancient cult without compromise.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Numen">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
