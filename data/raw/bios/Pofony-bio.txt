Pofony has quit.

Unfortunately all good things come to an end. There's no conflicts between the members, no musical indifferences or any of that sort of stuff. Other projects have taken most of our time (Jani in Callisto, Janne & Pekko in Medeia) and also personal lives have taken their toll, so there hasn't been that much time for this band any more.

We hope that you enjoy the music which will never seize to exist. To ensure this we also made the new record available in MP3 for free.

Pofony did 61 shows, two full-lenght albums, three EPs and one music video during it's existence.

We thank everyone who came to see our shows and supported our musical endeavours in any other forms!

Yours truly,
Jani, Janne, Pekko, Kari, Teemu & Konsta
