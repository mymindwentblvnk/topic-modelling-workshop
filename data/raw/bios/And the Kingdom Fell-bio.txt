BIO
While still holding onto the infamously harsh sound of traditional Death Metal, South Florida's melodic underdogs - And The Kingdom Fell, excels in taking a sidestep from the regular status quo by taking on a more 'Progressive-Rock' aesthetic. With the extreme meshing of such polar opposite genres, the listener can take in a gut-wrenching, yet atmospheric amalgam of both melodic and punishing metal. Our ultimate goal is to not only craft an engineered, signature sound but to capture the listener's appeal by delivering it live with a brutal and relentless force. Witness it, come to a show or even buy our latest release "The Seven Sounds" available on our band's Bandcamp. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/And+The+Kingdom+Fell">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
