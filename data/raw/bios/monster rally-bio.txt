Monster Rally is the brainchild of Columbus (Ohio) resident and Cleveland native (born in 1987) Ted Feighan. Producing music that is sampled-based tropical pop, Monster Rally began with the goal of assembling a bunch of old records into a completely different beast. Feighan began crafting tracks from his collection of records, combining his interests in Hip-hop, Exotica, Tropicalia, and Soul. Monster Rally creates tracks that manage to maintain a surprisingly organic sound, as if they were recorded by a full band on analog tape. There is something inherently nostalgic about the sound. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Monster+Rally">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
