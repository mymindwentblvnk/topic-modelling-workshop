WARHAG is the Canadian Metal Band that grew out of the departure of Kurt Phillips from Witchkiller. After leaving the band in the mid-80's, Kurt travelled to L.A. for a brief stint in Savage Grace, after which he relocated Vancouver Island. At this point he formed a band called Ace Koden, with drummer Tony Melizza and guitarist-turned-bassist Duane Nickull. They continued to write NWOBHM styled Metal and recruited Tom Vermuelen as a vocalist.
They relocated to Vancouver a year later, adding shredator 2nd guitarist Greg Lowe. Unable to keep the band together, they went their separate ways.
After a hiatus from playing music in the mid 90's Kurt resumed penning more metal and eventually recruited a band, calling it WARHAG after the name of the fan club he started for Witchkiller.
WARHAG released a mini-c.d. in 2002 title 'Sinister Grip', and have been going steadily since. In 2007 Kurt moved back to Vancouver Island and is continuing the WARHAG 'Imperial Quality Metal' chapters there. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Warhag">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
