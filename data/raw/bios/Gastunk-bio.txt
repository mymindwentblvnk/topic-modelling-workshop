Japanese hardcore punk/metal band formed in the mid 80's. There were some members of legendary The Execute, The Comes and also Dead Cops. They released some singles and pretty successful LP's "Dead Song" and "Under The Sun", which showed band's own vision of blending obscure Japanese hardcore with rock and metal. Later they've got some notice in U.S. but by the time of the "Mother" album, the band's popularity waned. Today there are limited reunion shows and commemorative albums. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gastunk">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
