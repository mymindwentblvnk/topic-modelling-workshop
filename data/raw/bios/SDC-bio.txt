SDC is an electronic music artist from New Hampshire, USA. His real name is Samuel Colburn and he has developed music since high school.

He recently created an official web site where samples and a couple of free tracks are available. The rest of the content of the site (all of his music so far) is available to VIP account holders, acquired by donating a small (and negotiable) amount. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/SDC">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
