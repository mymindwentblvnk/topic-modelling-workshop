Sakanaction (サカナクション) are a Japanese rock band from Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan, formed in 2005. Their music is a mix of alternative rock, electronic, pop, and New Wave styles; thus, it is difficult to classify this band under one category. 

The band consists of five members: Yamaguchi Ichiro (vocals & guitar), Iwadera Motoharu (guitar), Kusakari Ami (bass), Okazaki Emi (keyboard), and Ejima Keiichi (drums).

To them the fish symbolism reflects their wish to act quickly and lightly, like fish in the sea, without fearing changes in the music scene. Sakanaction = Sakana (fish) + Action. 

They are slowly but surely rising into popularity, having achieved some mainstream success. They have won music video awards, appeared on popular music show Music Station, and their latest album DocumentaLy captured 2nd spot on the Weekly Oricon Charts.
 
Their music is a light, nice to ears and soothing alternative rock, mixed with some electronic effects, creating an almost surreal image in listeners' minds. This surreal feeling can be seen at the band's PVs, lyrics and images.
