KARNIVORA was formed in the late of November 2009 in Jember. Started with Fahmi (Laboratory Sickness) that asked Rendy (Ex - Hidden Hatred, Ex - Immoral Incest) to form a new band. They both agree and look for any other members. Andre (Born With Tragedy) and Luqman (OUTNOBLOOD) chose to take out a place for vocal and bass. At last, this band formed with Brutal Death as the goal, or specifically called Guttural Brutal Death. The band inspired by many metal bands such as Disgorge, Deeds of Flesh, Devourment, Condemned, Slayer, Gorgasm, until the bands like Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath and Skid Row. For the name "KARNIVORA" itself was inspired much by many sadistic events in our world like cannibalism, war, massacre, butchery and inhumanity. We are now joined in a Jember Metal Sindicate called JEMBER DEATHGRIND (J.B.D.G) together with other Deathmetal and Grindcore bands.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Karnivora">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
