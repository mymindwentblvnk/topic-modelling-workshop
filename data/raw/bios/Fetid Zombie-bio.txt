Born in January 2007, FETID ZOMBIE is the gore-laden solo effort of Mark Riddick. Having his roots in the underground death/black metal scene since 1991, Mark is no stranger to the genre he explores. Mark’s earliest death metal effort was with EXCRESCENT, circa 1992; featuring himself alongside twin brother, Michael; EXCRESCENT published two successful demo tapes in ’92 and ’94. Mark has also been performing as a session member for UNBURIED since 1994, with which he has published two demo tapes and one CD. Music aside, Mark is best known for the familiar illustrations that embellish the aesthetic of FETID ZOMBIE. His art has been solicited by several others in the genre, for example THE BLACK DAHLIA MURDER, HYPOCRISY, ARSIS, DYING FETUS, THROUGH THE EYES OF THE DEAD and countless others. FETID ZOMBIE is essentially the auditory expression of Mark’s horrifying creativity, laced with sanguinary farce. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fetid+Zombie">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
