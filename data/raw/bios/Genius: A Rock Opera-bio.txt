Storyconcept introduction by the author Daniele Liverani (A lot more information is on the official site):

Genius is a rock opera trilogy that will include a total of 33 songs (11 for each episode).  Even if the total duration of the Opera is about 4 hours of music for 3 cd, the whole storyconcept refers to a dream experienced by the main character 'Genius' that lasts only 10 minutes!  

It's known that dreams are often creating a time-stretch effect in our minds, so that a 10 minutes long dream can be remembered as a day long story...
Infact, these 10 minutes of Genius' dream has been described in 4 hour of music!

But we are not talking about a regular dream like all humans have always  experienced...

In this 10 minutes Genius goes too far and discovers for the first time all the secrets of human's dream creation... <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Genius:+A+Rock+Opera">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
