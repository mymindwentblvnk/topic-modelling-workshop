Kendall Miles is an instrumentalist and producer from Raleigh, NC.


MilesI started playing guitar when he was 14. Seing his father produce and play a lot of music when he was young, inspired him to pursue his own career in music. Early on, he showed interest in learning every aspect of music, from the writing process, to recording and mix/mastering. At the age of 18 he started recording his own music while in college.

The instrument Miles is most skilled at is guitar. He had always wanted to be in a fusion or mathrock band, but never found enough band mates. He was however fortunate enough to be able to learn and record piano songs without much prior piano experience. Another instrument he plays includes synthesizer, and midi sounds. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kendall+Miles">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
