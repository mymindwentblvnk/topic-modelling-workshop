The Cairo Gang is a musical declaration uniting the romanticists with the doomsayers for a round of high fives and hand shakes. The ballad _Mother Earth_ is acoustically organic, delivering the listener an early Neil Young feel with bewitching flutes and bongos. Over the course of recent years, The Cairo Gang has been a lingering passion for Emmett Kelly, a stimulated singer/songwriter with an impressive list of musicians in his rolodex. Performing with a back up band or solo, Kelly always brings a freshened thrill to the world of quiet rock music. After mastering countless instruments, Kelly decided to put his skills to work and record some tunes that have been afloat in his headspace. And thank the heavens he did, because this album perfectly tweaks the butterflies in all of our stomachs. Deep, soft rock for tobacco tinged hearts, that’s The Cairo Gang in a nutshell.

The Cairo Gang has toured w/ Beth Orton & was a guest on the Will Oldhem album "The Letting Go" recorded in Reykjavík, Iceland

While there's nothing new about the Cairo Gang's debut full-length, none of it sounds canned or dated either. How do they make oft-cited influences sound fresh? Long answer: The Cairo Gang take the instrumentation of gentle British 70's folk with the free-form composition and detached, beard-stroking vibe of post-rock, all executed with the fidelity and humility of homespun indie rock. Short answer: The Cairo Gang cuts across musical movements of several years' span to create music sounding distinctly out of time. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Cairo+Gang">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
