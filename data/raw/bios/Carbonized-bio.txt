1) Carbonized used to be a Swedish death metal band. They later developed into psychedelic grind and gradually became more and more avant garde. Their final album Screaming Machines was a psychedelic and disonant sounding metal album and was at least at the time of the release one of the weirdest records ever released. They never formally split up the band, but have made no sound since 1996 and the members have no contact with each other anymore. All of the members have played or still play in Therion.

2) Death Metal band from Brazil. Formed in 1998, they released a demo album 'The Evil Dead' in 2002. The band is currently inactive. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Carbonized">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
