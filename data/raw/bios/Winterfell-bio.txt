Originally formed in 2000 by vocalist Robb Graves, and Ex Guitarists Andy Craven and Jason Nadeau, Winterfell pounded away at the foundation of the Central PA music scene fighting for a chance to be heard in a region that shuns originality. Releasing an EP in November, 2002 entitled Winter is Coming with Ex Drummer James Irvine, Winterfell received praise and worldwide support from a growing fan base. This prompted a lineup change soon after, adding Bassist Greg Weitknecht and replacing James with Ex Drummer Ed Silva. The new lineup toured lightly in the PA, NJ, MD area and even hit the Milwaukee Metal fest before finally completing and releasing thier first full length album independently in August of 2005 entitled The Veil of Summer. This 9 track disc would go on to receive great praise worldwide earning positive reviews form countless webzines, and print publications (including Hard Rock and Metal Maniacs) eventually selling out of it's initial 1000 disk pressing in early 2006.

Sadly, shortly after the release of Veil, Drummer Ed Silva and Andy Craven left the band to pursue lives outside of the music industry.

Winterfell played it's last official show November 3rd 2005 at Jaxx nightclub in Springfield Va. opening for Seven Witches and Kamelot with new drummer Brady Sadler. It was a legendary night and an unforgettable show.

Vocalist Robb Graves has vowed to continue Winterfell with a new lineup sometime in the future but for now the band remains on an indefinite hiatus. Enjoy the music, and always remember...
