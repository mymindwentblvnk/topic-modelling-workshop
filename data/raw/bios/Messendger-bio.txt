Sole privately pressed album from Atlanta power trio Messendger.
Veterans of the Southern bar band scene, they recorded their only album in 1982 and released it on their own Jab records label (JAB III).
Some initial copies also came with an exclusive 7" included, the tracks on this are unknown, such is the items scarcity.
This is one of the hardest indie Southern Hard Rock LPs to find anywhere.
After it began to generate rave reviews in the European Metal press, French label Bernett Records released the album in Europe in 1983 (SBR18001).
There is also a French 45 of "Strangers", with "No One Will Stand In The Way", on the flip. Whilst the USA got a 7" release of "Be Bop A Lula" coupled with "Strangers".
They played pretty hard stuff for the time, sounding at times like early Triumph while the guitarwork is comparable to Gary Moore's on the G-Force album but much harder. 
Increasingly expensive and hard to find nowadays, but if you see a reasonably priced copy don't hesitate to buy it.
If you love heavy hard rock with melody, you'll be in heaven with this fantastic little record from this amazing trio. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Messendger">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
