4)”Blend” is an Alternative-Nu Metal Band hailing from New Delhi, India. Early 2007 was the time when the nascent band assembled, drawing it’s inspiration from various genres ranging from classic, metal, progressive rock on to alternative and nu-metal bands to find that flawless blend of creativity, which have inspired them on to create the unique band’s sound. It was at the IIT-Delhi’s ‘BLITZKRIEG’ in September 2007 where we realized that we had it in us to make it big, after being selected for the finals.The focus and belief right from the band’s inception has been on Original Compositions and it was in April 2007 when the band started the recording sessions of “Suffocate” and “Wait For Me Time”, their first musical brainchild…songs that have gone on to become crowd favorites right after their Live Debut.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Blend">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
