"The recordings present a unique musical vision, with Xander Singh and Luc Laurent displaying an impressive mastery of their twisted but tasty pop...A treat-filled introduction to a duo unafraid to pound around on a variety of instruments such as trumpet, banjo, and piano...Singh and Laurent seamlessly blend their influences into a unified sound."
