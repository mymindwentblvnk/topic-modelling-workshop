Out of Siberian urban cold, slush, dark nights, streetlights and late underground trains comes a funeral doom band inspired and fueled by the urban man’s dystopia and perpetual solitude. Station Dysthymia is currently embarked on the angst-ridden, alcohol-fueled solemn path of torturingly slow and painfully heavy music.

Formed in 2007 by S. and O. without any serious intentions, the outfit was soon joined by A. and B., to fill a complete lineup. No serious intentions have shown up so far.

The band’s debut “Only Gray Days”, was recorded and mixed in July-August ‘09 on The Lair Of Evil and Eltsovian Forest studios in true DIY fashion, and released to a torrent tracker near you by Inner Warmth.

The band had a fruitful stay in Mocow during August '12, where they played at Moscow Funeral League vol. 2 (together with Abstract Spirit and Decay of Reality) and recorded their 2nd full-length at Primordial Studio. The new album was mixed and mastered by Greg Chandler of Esoteric at Priory Recording and is to be released on July 1st '13 by Solitude Productions.

The funeral brigade is:

B. – bass, vocals
S. – guitars
A. – guitars
O. – synth programming, artwork
