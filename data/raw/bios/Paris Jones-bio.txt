Dressed in whatever fits his feelings instead of what’s in, eclectic and new-age, hip hop rapper, Paris Jones, takes the overlooked, often chaotic and instability of young black America into sound frequencies he’s generated from years of experiencing what Tupac rapped about. Artist, songwriter, and producer, Jones, as a creative, considers himself a child of the spark Pac’ created within society. The innovation behind Paris’ vision and lyrics, “pure feeling and pure emotion.”

From Palmdale, California, Patrick Campbell, began dabbling in music before he was even a teen. After going to Liberty University in Virginia, Campbell, simply known as P.J. back then, met his current management team and began solidifying his career through music instead of sports. Whether playing the drums or discovering his next song singing in the shower, Jones’ method to his lyrical madness is, simply put, staying clean. Writing nearly all songs in the shower to the extent of creating show ideas and video concepts, here Jones finds his inspiration flows like water. However, Jones’ musing of staying clean goes deeper than just the surface area of things, in which most are used to.

With a refreshingly different way of thinking, Jones likes to disrupt the mediocre and common. His purpose: “Facilitate change, create a new group of leaders, and take them into a new realm of thinking through his artistry.“ Pulling off his headphones clamoring Mad Mix Mustang Mash-ups long enough to explain his name, Jones’ sometimes oxymoron of a quiet demeanor speaks elevation, which his music also represents. “Paris is for the finer things. People have joneses for shoes, etc. I have a Jones for living above the mediocre lives most are expected to just accept and live.” <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Paris+Jones">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
