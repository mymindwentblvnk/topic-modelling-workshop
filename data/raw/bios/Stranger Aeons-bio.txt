Until 28 April, 2009 Stranger Aeons were known under the name of Bestija.
The band started in 2002, in Å iauliai, Lithuania and their basic purpose was to have as much fun as possible.
As time passed by, band members came and went, musicianship and compositional skills improved and the band realized it was impossible to evolve more within the premises of Bestija. Therefore, after long hours of discussion and contemplation the word became flesh and the band is now known under the name of STRANGER AEONS.

The following human beings are dedicated to spreading the sound of progressive metal upon the land of Lithuania:
Edita Burbulyte : vocals
Rokas Gircius: electric and acoustic guitars, backing vocals
Domas Gircius: keys, guitars, backing vocals
Kostas Balciunas: guitars
Laimonas Tamosiunas: bass
Justinas Jakubauskas: drums, percussion, harsh vocals
