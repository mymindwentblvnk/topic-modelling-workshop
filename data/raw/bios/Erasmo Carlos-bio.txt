Erasmo Carlos (born Erasmo Esteves on June 5, 1941, in the Tijuca area of Rio de Janeiro) is a Brazilian singer and songwriter, most closely associated with his friend and longtime collaborator Roberto Carlos (no relation). Together, they have created many chart hits including "É Proibido Fumar".

A core member of the Jovem Guarda ("Young Guard") scene of 1960's Brazilian pop-rock, Erasmo often appeared on television, in magazines and feature films with fellow teen idols Roberto Carlos and Wanderléa.

In contrast to his simpler pop-rock early sound, Erasmo went on to produce several of the more moody and introspective MPB records of the 1970's, including "Sonhos e Memórias" and "Carlos, Erasmo". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Erasmo+Carlos">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
