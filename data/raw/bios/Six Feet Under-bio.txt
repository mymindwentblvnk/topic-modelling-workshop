A side project band started by Chris Barnes and Allen West of Obituary. Originally, the band was intended to just remain a side project, but after Chris was ejected from his original band Cannibal Corpse, Six Feet Under became his priority, subsequently moving the band from a side project to the long running act they are today. 

Guest appearances through various Six Feet Under albums include Ice-T on True Carnage's "One Bullet Left" and Karyn Crisis of Crisis fame on the True Carnage song "Sick and Twisted." Many consider this the first death metal duet between a male and female.

World-renowned tattoo artist Paul Booth is known to do most of Six Feet Under's album art. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Six+Feet+Under">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
