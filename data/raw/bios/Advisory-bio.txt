1) Advisory is a metalcore band from Frankfurt, Germany. Founded in 2000, the band played some gigs and also recorded songs, but after a while this project has taken a back seat. In 2007, the founder members reactivated the band with new musicians, who fit perfectly in the style of music Advisory is producing. They are mixing elements of metal and hardcore, while setting a high value on creating atmosphere with melodies. Also the "groove" and moshparts play an important role in Advisory's songs. Influenced by bands like Caliban, Neaera, Heaven Shall Burn and Maroon they are developing their own style of music.

In January 2008 they recorded the demo of one of their new songs called "Liberation" and in April they will have their first concert after their "come-back". Many more songs are already written and will be recorded very soon and other gigs are also planned...

Line-Up:

Georg Thomassen - Vocals
Tim Rosswinkel - Guitar
Moritz Spahn - Guitar
Ryan Leverenz-Mompellio - Bass Guitar
Stefan Schulz-Anker - Drums

2) Advisory is a ruthless grindcore band from Budapest, Hungary. The studio project is the brainchild of reowned Budapest underground drummer Adam 'Dösi' Dechatel of Fregath, Mi Voltunk Azok, Terraformer Deluxe (formerly Harvester, Mindless Creation, etc). After the demise of cult grindcore-stoner rock band Harvester, he continued in hard rock band Fregath but had an urge to play devastating grindcore, so Advisory was born with the help of Dávid Komlósi (of Fregath, Heroic fame) on guitars and bass, and Bertalan 'Srég' Csala  (ex-Bornholm, former Harvester singer) on vocals. They have 3 albums so far, the latest entitled 'True Grindcore'.
