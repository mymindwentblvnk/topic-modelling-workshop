STRANGLER was conceived in 2003 by vocalist/ guitar player Mads Hårløv shortly after the INIQUITY split-up. His aim was to create a more straight on approach to the death metal genre.
He was soon accompanied by Reno Killerich (DIMMU BORGIR, HATE ETERNAL, PANZERCHRIST etc.) on drums and in late 2003 bass player Martin Rosendahl (CORPUS MORTALE, INIQUITY, EXMORTEM etc.) followed to complete the line-up.
The "Infinite Blood Abundance" demo was recorded in 2004. Shortly thereafter Reno left the band. Morten Løwe (THE CLEANSING, SUBMISSION, AMARANTHE etc.) and Kræn Meier (SACRIFICIAL, INIQUITY etc.) joined and material for the debut album was written and rehearsed intensively.
Due to various issues this album was never recorded and the band split up some time in 2005...  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/STRANGLER">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
