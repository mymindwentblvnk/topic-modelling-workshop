What we can expect, if members and ex-members from bands like GRAVE, COERCION, THIRDMOON, IN SLUMBER, EISBLUT, AVULSED and DISTASTE work together is: ENORMOUS! Founded in 2007 GodHateCode will celebrate old school death metal, paired with modern and straight in the face brutality. The swedish/austrian/spanish based four-piece will show no mercy, so be prepared for the "Aeons" titled album coming in spring 2008. Since the band has a complete line up with bassplayer Tana from Avulsed, they will also hit the stages soon! GodHateCode will not be an allstars studio project only, they will celebrate an death metal Inferno and stay 100% behind the brutality of their intense sound.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/GodHateCode">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
