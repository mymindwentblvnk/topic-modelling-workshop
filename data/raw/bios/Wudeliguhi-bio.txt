Wudeliguhi is the depressive slanted black metal project of the creative force behind Unhuman Disease. Reaching beyond the ubiquitous anguish, the eight hymns found on "Diyosvhi Ganodu" beget an overwhelming atmosphere of distant isolation. The music is not comforting as icy tendrils of hopelessness wrap around the listener's throat tightening slowly until all that remains is a lifeless vessel. In the end, Wudeliguhi spare no one from a lugubrious lonely demise. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wudeliguhi">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
