Timbaland & Magoo left Swing Mob after 1995 and became a performing duo in their own right. Signing with Blackground Records (home of Aaliyah, one of Timbaland's main collaborators), Timbaland & Magoo went on to release a number of albums, which were not as successful as the singles that anchored them. Singles such as "Up Jumps the Boogie [Remix]", "Clock Strikes [Remix]" (which samples the Knight Rider theme), "Here We Come" (which samples the 1960s Spider-Man theme), "Drop", "All Y'all", and "Cop That Disc" have all proved successful, while the albums that they appeared on have generally underperformed. Their first LP "Welcome To Our World" sold over 1 Million copies <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Timbaland+&+Magoo">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
