This eclectic blend of 20's big band, swing, jazz, punk and metal would have been goth if it had been 10 years earlier, and would have been deathrock 10 years later. If features Michelle Amar (a classically trained french opera singer who did alot of backing vocals for the Swedish metal band Celtic Frost) as a vocallist and was produced by Roli Mosimann of Foetus fame.

Sadly it showed up at entirely the wrong time for marketabillity and never acheived the fame it deserved. However even 10 years later it still sounds fresh and unique! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sulfur">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
