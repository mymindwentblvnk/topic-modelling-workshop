BIO

"Adveniat Hiems" formed in 2006, based in Milan, Italy. 

The band is dedicated to the production of short concept albums (about 20 minutes each) about northern mythology and themes from the Nordic-European folklore.

The basic lineup consists of three people and is integrated with session singers/musicians when needed.

SOUND

The band sound is simple and cold, linear.
The band aims to have a direct and strong impact on the listener, not impressing him with complexity but charming the audience with atmosphere and evocative sounds. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Adveniat+Hiems">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
