Jon McMillion (aka Wig Water Magic) has been making electronic music for over 15 years, always calling on a vast cache of sounds, styles, and techniques to flesh out his tripped-out aural sensibilities. A Seattle native, and a classically trained musician, he uses live bass, drums, guitar, and piano in his productions. With the launch of the Jon McMillion LP on Nuearth Kitchen - along with a string of other featured treats - McMillion has proven to be an incredibly impressive and unique talent. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jon+McMillion">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
