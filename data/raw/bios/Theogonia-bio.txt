"Theogonia" appeared in 2002 when four old friends decided to gather and play doom-death and heavy metal, so loved by many people. At that time the frontman of the band was Roman Pan’ko. As to the style, the band would play doom and death metal. Some time later Artem Prepelytsia started to perform duties of the frontman. With these members "Theogonia" existed till 2008. In 2008 Roman Pan’ko left the band and his place was taken by Aleksandr Bableniuk. From the very beginning the name of the band was "The Shadow", then it was changed on “Тінь” (Tin’), and this name was in use also till 2008. As the cast of the band changed, and because of some other factors, the name was changed again. Now it was "Theogonia". The name was suggested by Victor Greenxxx whom we met during one of the concerts in Kyiv, and who contributes much to the development of the band (for what we are very grateful to him). In the summer of 2003 the band was ready for its first concert. It took place in the band’s native town Sokyriany (Ukraine) and made a good impression on the listeners. Later the former “Shadow” gave another performance in this town. The next performance, after a rather long break, was given in 2005 at the “Відродження” (Vidrodzhennia) rock-festival that took place in Chernivtsi, Ukraine. The band won the third place.
