A Death Metal band from Edmonton, Canada.
A veteran band of many years, Death Toll Rising play old school death metal with a modern twist, with technical drum work, crushing and ear catching riffs, and gritty vocals featuring throughout their careers.
2010 brought us the now Edmonton classic 'Defecation Suffocation', and the band has since released the epic 'Infection Legacy' in 2013, further solidifying themselves as Alberta's pre-eminent death metal band. 
The experience and quality of muscianship and writing within the band ensures they are a band to keep one's eye on for years to come. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Death+Toll+Rising">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
