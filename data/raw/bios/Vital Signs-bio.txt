There are more bands with this name:

1) Maybe apart from Nazia Hassan, the only other Pakistani pop act that has retained such intense interest and popularity after its demise has been the Vital Signs. But whereas Nazia's classic status and popularity were duly propelled by her working relationship with famous British disco producer, Biddu, the Signs had more of a struggle to face, trying to play and sell the kind of pop that was still a risky anomaly in the Pakistan of the mid and late '80s.

2) An AOR rock band from the US: http://www.stagedude.com/vitalsigns/
