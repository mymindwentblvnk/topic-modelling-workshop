Nox Aurea was born in early autumn 2005 in Gothenburg, Sweden when the friends Peter (Rimfrost, Urginnthul, The Cold Existence) and Vindkall (Domg√•rd, Urginnthul, Gand Marder, V) after some rehearsals without any directions or plans, decided to start a musical project and make a few songs together. The result was very different from both of the member's earlier experiences, but it was one of the purposes with this project; to create something different than their other creations. The dark seed of Nox Aurea was sown and the flower of death has grown fast.

In the beginning of 2007 Peter and Vindkall decided to recruit two new members, Peters friends Jan Sallander and Robert Persson. The following year the singer Alice Persell and drummer Joakim Antonsson joined Nox Aurea.

The abstract concept of Nox Aurea is based upon dark emotions, the deep search beyond the physical world and the chaos-gnostic philosophy; life is not a gift of truth but a curse of illusions and an offending imprisonment of the higher spirit. The name Nox Aurea is latin and means "golden night" which symbolizes the dark eternity of freedom and chaos. Their debut album, "Via Gnosis", was released in the end of August 2008 via Solitude Productions.

The band currently consists of:

Peter Laustsen - guitar, bass, synth
