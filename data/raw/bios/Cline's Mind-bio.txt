Cline's Mind is a one man arsenal of pure, aggressive metal. Just a guy with his guitar for which he will play till the end of existence. With no exact path or current trend to follow, the music written & produced by Cline's Mind will always be genuine & real. Powerful, melodic and in-your-face metal will always be the main goal when it comes to composing.

Influences over the years have been Iron Maiden, Exodus, Testament, Slayer, Metallica (old school), Vio-Lence and many new modern bands of the 2K era. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cline%27s+Mind">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
