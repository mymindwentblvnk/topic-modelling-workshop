Quilt is an American four-piece psychedelic indie rock band from Boston.  
"QUILT have forged a captivating universe of psychedelica, dream-pop, and folk-- full of warmth, sure, but also a calmness and a peacefulness that leaves us longing for New England green." - Daniel Gottlieb (Altered Zones)
"Listening to these Brooklyn-via-Boston psych-folkers is enigmatic. First, they sound as though they write and record their music on some far-out teepee commune in New Mexico in 1971 while wearing navajo print drug rugs and smudging sage around the campfire." - YVYNYL
"Bearers of God's personal shamble-pop dripped all the way from heaven..."-Bodies of Water
"Luminous, unfiltered, haunting psych-folk that teeters among three dangerously creative minds" - Boston Phoenix
