Contrary to their official bio, which claims theyâ€™re a duo from Denmark, Reptile Youth are actually the relocated souls of a thousand long-lost Brooklyn post-punk bands, cousins of the Rapture and Radio 4 who have been summoned back to this cold, dead earth for one last dance. Luckily, the funky, hook-laden Gang of Four worship, with some production from a guy who's worked with the Human League, Lady Gaga, and Hot Chip, sounds sincere enough to make these Danes pretty great.
