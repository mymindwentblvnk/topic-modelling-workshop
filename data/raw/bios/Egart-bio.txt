Egart are a metal band born in Italy in 1997. Since the
beginning they have always focused on the production of original songs without trying to follow
any style or sub-genre in particular. Along the years the line up went through several changes, and
so did the sound, but the spirit remained the same: to produce original songs and to give particular
attention to the band’s background and live performance. The proposed genre is defined as
“Chaosmetal”, for background reasons and because of the great variety of subgenres which are
mixed in the songs.
