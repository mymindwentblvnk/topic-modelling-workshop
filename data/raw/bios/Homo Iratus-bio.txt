Homo Iratus were formed in july 1998 and released their first demo tape named "ABSENCE OF PROGRESS" on that very month. Their progress through music led to their first full length album entitled "HUMAN CONSUMES HUMAN" in 2001 which granted them a contract with "ARCTIC MUSIC GROUP (USA)" with which the "KNOWLEDGE...THEIR ENEMY"Mini CD was released in 2002. The second full length album entitled "APOCALYPSE" was released in 2004 by "CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY" Records (USA).

After a lot of line up changes and a long lasting hiatus, homoiratus reached an abrupt end on May 2007. The band reformed in 2009 and released a four track EP “Truth Conquers All” shortly after. 
2012, Homo Iratus are currently preparing for the next full length album and shows to support the upcoming release. (Check out contact information for booking)
