Fallen Grace is a melodic death metal band based in Colombo, Sri Lanka.

In a country where heavy & extreme forms of metal are shunned down upon & considered unseemly, Fallen Grace rose in late 2003, with it's to the hundreds of Metal's detractors & posers to attest that a revolution was brewing in an island of 20 million, similar to all of South Asia.

The bands music is highly reminiscent of bands which evolved in the Gothenburg era in Sweden such as Dark Tranquility, At the Gates, Arch Enemy, (early) Inflames & Opeth. The bands also draw influence from bands from the 1st wave of Black Metal; Venom & Bathory & are also ardent followers of early heavy metal gods, Iron Maiden, Motorhead & Black Sabbath.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fallen+grace">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
