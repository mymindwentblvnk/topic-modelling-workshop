Ringo Deathstarr is a shoegaze band from Austin, TX.  Channelling influences such as My Bloody Valentine, Fugazi, The Cure, The Smiths and The Velvet Underground into their own unique sonic fingerprint, the band released their eponymous EP in 2007. This was followed by a string of singles and a series of international tours hitting both coasts and the streets of the UK and Japan. The band's debut full-length album, Colour Trip, was released in February 2011 by Club AC30, followed by EPs collection Sparkler, and second album Mauve. They began 2014 with the God's Dream EP, released in North America on Neon Sigh and Noyes, and have built a reputation for touring the US and Japan annually.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ringo+Deathstarr">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
