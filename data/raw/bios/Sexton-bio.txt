SexTon is an American alternative rock/punk band formed in 2008 in Youngstown, Ohio. They currently have one full-length album, "A Better Forever (2010)," which is available as downloadable content for the hit music/video game Rock Band® 2 (and later for Rock Band® 3).

"Rather than focus on traditional methods of being heard, we want to bring our music to the forefront of entertainment in the video gaming industry," lead singer John Cutlip said. "We're all gamers and I think it's important that we cater to people like us, who would really dig our sound."

SexTon has been featured in local news media and is looking to expand "sometime in the next few years."

"Right now, we just want to develop our sound and make enough material to support a tour or a long-term commitment to our careers."

"We're headed for something big, definitely."

SexTon is currently seeking contracts and sponsorships. Interested parties can contact John Cutlip at sextonband@live.com.
