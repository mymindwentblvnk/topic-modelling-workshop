There are two artists with the name of Marsh. For the black metal one, go here: Mἄrsh. 

Marsh - British Progressive House Producer. Tom Marshall

Following his debut ‘You’ll Be Fine’ released on Silk Music’s Arrival imprint in June 2012, half a year was all it took for the UK’s Tom Marshall, aka. Marsh to gain the spotlight amongst many electronic dance music stars.

Recognised for his high energy grooves, pulsating beats and endorphin inducing melodies, it comes as no surprise that the Brit has already gained support by leading talents Dinka, Solarstone, Max Graham, Myon & Shane 54. Yet it is his widely acclaimed ‘Sleeping Now’ taken from his ‘Ethereal EP’ which has gained the most attention to date. Supported by Above & Beyond as both their ‘Trance Around The World, Record Of The Week’ and ‘Web Vote Winner’, the track has later become the record company Arrival’s best seller and continues to stir the hearts of many progressive fans worldwide.

With fresh EPs, remixes, collaborations all in the pipeline, 2013 looks to be Marsh’s biggest year yet. Expect music that will speak directly to the soul. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/marsh">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
