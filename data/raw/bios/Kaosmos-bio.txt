KAOSMOS is the solo ambient project of Filiz Sert from Istanbul, started in 2013.
She creates a fusion of atmospheric themes and humming cold layers of synthesizers, bringing KAOSMOS to life. She aims to emancipate her listeners from the reality we live in this planet, during she performs her music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kaosmos">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
