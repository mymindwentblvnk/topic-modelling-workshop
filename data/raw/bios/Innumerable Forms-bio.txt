Innumerable Forms take on the ancient Death Metal stylings of bands like Incantation, Disgrace, Abhorrence, Convulse, Grave etc at their primitive and brutal best. Each song celebrates the traditions of old with a bleak presentation of total darkness and despair, no triggering or pitch shifting, only death.
