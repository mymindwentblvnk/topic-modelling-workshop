WILDES, real name Ella Walker, is a British multi-instrumentalist & singer-songwriter from London. Born to an Irish mother and British father her music lends itself to her mixed heritage upbringing. An undeniable passion for creating vast soundscapes, Ella's music is both dramatic and beautiful, reflective of her childhood summers spent running wild in the Irish countryside and echoes the expansive sound like that of Florence and The Machine or The XX.  After putting up her first song 'Bare', WILDES garnered overwhelming support online, shooting to #6 in the Spotify global viral chart and subsequently grabbing the attention of BBC Radio 1 DJ Phil Taggart and Grammy Award-winning producer Brian Burton (Danger Mouse), landing her a publishing deal. The song has since featured on multiple soundtracks and generated millions of streams worldwide. Since then WILDES has been refining her sound, working closely with award-winning producer Catherine Marks (Foals, Wolf Alice, Manchester Orchestra, The Killers), fusing her indie-folk songwriting with bold cinematic soundscapes. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/wildes">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
