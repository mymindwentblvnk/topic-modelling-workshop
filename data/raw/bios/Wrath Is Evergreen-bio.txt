Wrath Is Evergreen was founded by IngWar

In spring 2006 rush about the world was stopped by illness. Illness that gave me inspiration. After composing two songs I found that there will be more. That was a birth of Wrath Is Evergreen.

Wrath Is Evergreen exspresses experimental doom metal with some influences of black metal. Newer also includes something from funeral doom. Music is quite monotonous, depressive, dismal and dreary.

In spring 2008 Kädi and Suva joined the legion to give one live. Kädi helped with her evil vocals and Suva with his down-tuned guitar. The band had a new future with more members and more active life. In autumn drummer Tambet joined and filled the empty place of live percussion. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wrath+Is+Evergreen">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
