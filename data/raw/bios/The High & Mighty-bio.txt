The High & Mighty are an underground rap duo from Philadelphia consisting of rapper Mr. Eon ("The High", b. Eric Meltzer) and DJ Mighty Mi ("The Mighty", b. Milo Berger). Their commercial debut was in 1999 on the underground rap label Rawkus with their album, "Home Field Advantage", featuring rappers such as Mos Def, Kool Keith, What? What? (aka Jean Grae), Pharoahe Monch, Evidence of Dilated Peoples, Defari and Eminem. They later left Rawkus, distributing the records issued by their own record company Eastern Conference Records via Landspeed Records. They also established a group called Smut Peddlers with Cage and published an album called "Porn Again".

The High and Mighty have a penchant for subjects that break the usual hip hop stereotypes. The titles of their albums and the name of their record label are both references to one of their favourite musical subjects, American professional team sports. Home Field Advantage, for example, features numerous sporting references, including the track Friendly Game of Football and mentions of the '69 New York Mets, Cris Carter and Jason Sehorn, among others. Another recurring source of lyrical fodder is the Star Wars film series, with Home Field Advantage including lines about Jedi Master Mace Windu, the bounty hunter Greedo, Anakin Skywalker and the shiny droid C-3PO. Also, one of the main background substances throughout album lyrics was THC and consumption of marijuana in various forms. The group sometimes touched on more or less political issues such as economy and music industry. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+High+&+Mighty">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
