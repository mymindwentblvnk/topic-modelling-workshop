Demented Ted was a death metal band from Villa Park (IL), USA.
The band was formed in 1991, and in 1993 they Signed with Pavement Records and recorded their only full length album, Promises Impure. During this time Mark Kohler briefly replaced Eric Alverez on the bass, this however did not last long. Touted as prog-death metal and likely influenced by the likes of Carcass in the days of the album Necroticism: Descanting the Insalubrious . Demented Ted were unsuccesful and soon after they renamed the band Beyond and released one album still with the Pavement Label.  Having no success due to poor promotion and literally no support from Pavement. The members hung up their Death Metal hats and formed the industrial band Drag Star, without Ken Cutler. After recording a 3 song demo, they parted ways. Recently all the members (Except Ken Cutler) have reformed to form the rock band Honey.
