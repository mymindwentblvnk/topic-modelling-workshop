Friends of Dean Martinez is an American instrumental rock/post-rock band from Tucson, Arizona, featuring members of Giant Sand, Calexico, and Naked Prey. 

They play sad, sweet, instrumental desert music, with Bill Elm's steel guitar acting as both lead guitar and voice. Though the mood is rather laid-back, they're not to be mistaken for lounge lizards--people just have a hard time categorizing non-rock music. Far from being a "novelty" act, Friends Of Dean Martinez are just one of many contemporary bands rediscovering the emotional power of music beyond rock 'n' roll. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Friends+of+Dean+Martinez">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
