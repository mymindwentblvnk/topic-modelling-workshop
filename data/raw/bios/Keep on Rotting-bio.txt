Keep on Rotting is a technical death metal band from Litoměřice, Czech Republic.
They were formed in 2003 and spent a long period of time without drummer. During the formative years they've played with programmed drums and recorded several D.I.Y. demo songs in rather low sound quality.
In January 2010 they've found a talented, young and technically proficient drummer Jan (Hanzz). Since then the band moved forward really quick. They've recorded their debut EP The Beginning released in December 2011. Keep on Rotting won a MetalGate Massacre competition and got the opportunity to record and release their first full-lenght album Unforeseen Consequences in the end of October 2013 through MetalGate Records label. They've performed two times at Brutal Assault Festival in 2012 and 2014.
