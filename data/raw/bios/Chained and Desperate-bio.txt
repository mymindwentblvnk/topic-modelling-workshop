About Chained and Desperate 



   Chained and Desperate were formed at the early 90’s by Panos and C. M. Ain in order to play extreme music. 
  The band passed through different kinds of metal such as Melodic Doom Death Metal and Black Metal influenced by the local style with a majestic epic feeling. 
   During the 90’s the band released 4 demos and 1 full length album and received very good reviews especially for the album and the live concerts. Unfortunately, the opportunities that the band had for contract with a couple of labels didn’t give the expecting results. 
  The band is back in action since 2004 with new blood injected into it’s chain. It’s members are currently recording the new material for the release of  their 2nd full length album. 
   The music of the band is difficult to be characterized with the known typical standards. The attempt to describe their music as War Metal with epic elements following the path of Blood Fire Death is the most suitable. The band’s music is influenced greatly by the talented spirit of Chuck Schuldiner and Death, Emperor, Rotting Christ and haunted by Manilla Road and Bathory.
