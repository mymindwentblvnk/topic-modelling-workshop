Soldier's Heart is a young Belgian band wich was formed in 2012. Within a year a lot of things happened. Benjamin Cools (octapad), Sylvie Kreusch (vocals) and Laurens Marien (synths) started the band with the idea to create a specific, personal sound. Before they knew it, a new band member had arrived: Jasper Segers (guitar). Because the band wanted more layers in their sound, but still stick to the concept of no-computer nor acoustic drum on stage, they decided to add another bandmember, the youngest one, Ferre Marnef (Bass).
The band was selected for Humo's Rock Rally and received the Cutting Edge Awards 2013 for ‘Talent of the Year’. In April 2013 they won ‘De Nieuwe Lichting’, a competition where the Belgian radio station Studio Brussel was looking for new, talented bands. The reason for the success in this competition was their first single ‘African Fire’ and their dynamic cover of the song ‘Broad Daylight’ (Gabriel Rios). ‘African Fire’ is a song that balances between dreams and reality. Sylvie Kreusch takes you away with her thin fragile voice on a journey that feels like coming home. 
This year they performed at several clubs such as 4AD(Diksmuide), Trix (Antwerp) and one of Europe’s finest Ancienne Belgique (Brussels),.
On stage the guys show dynamics and energy. In combination with the mysterious front singer makes Soldier’s Heart a band worth to watch live. 
Soldier's Heart makes exotic dreampop with a twist. This summer they play on several festivals (Pukkelpop) and they are working on their debut album .
