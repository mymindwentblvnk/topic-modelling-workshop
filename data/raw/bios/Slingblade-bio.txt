There are a couple of bands named Slingblade.

1. A heavy metal band from Stockholm, Sweden influenced by Accept, Judas Priest, Saxon and Warlock. Released the debut album "The Unpredicted Deeds of Molly Black" on High Roller Records in 2011.

2. A "Roadhouse Music" band based in Rockbridge County, Virginia, available with an Electric or Acoustic configuration. SlingBlade's "Roadhouse Music" can be described as "Roots Rock fused with Americana on steroids" and brings to Virginia a sound that has its roots in the roadhouses of Austin, Texas and the smoky barrooms of Nashville, Tennessee. A SlingBlade evening runs the musical gamut from acoustic story-songs to honky-tonk bar-boogie to raucous rock. SlingBlade evolved from two successful musical groups and is composed of: Lance Foster (Master of Percussion, Vocals)) and Jeremy Leadbetter (Guitar, Mandolin, Vocals) both from The Convertibles (Psychedelic Frat-Rock); and Dave Eakin (Guitars, Harmonica, Vocals) and Wayne "Rexx" Rexrode (SlingBass, Vocals) both from Showdown (Classic Rock/Country. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/SlingBlade">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
