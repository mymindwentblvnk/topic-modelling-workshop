Dead To A Dying World is band from Dallas, Texas with 7 members; they add cello and upright bass to these epic tunes... songs that have the epicness of crust like bands such as Martyrd√∂d, Tragedy, Fall of Efrafa, Ekkaia or Remains of the day; but at the same time they incorporate slow and dark melodies that sound more like atmospheric sludge, plus some black metal here and there with female vocals.
