Guy Mann-Dude is an American-born musician who was best known in the late 1980s and early 1990s after his self named band formed in Los Angeles, California in 1988. He was also guitar player for the Michael Angelo Band before going solo.

Born Guy Shiffman,  he was a professional drummer for ten years before getting into heavy metal. He toured with the lead singer of Yes, Jon Anderson, for his 1982 Animation Tour. Although an accomplished drummer doing studio work and leading his own bands, Shiffman turned to his first love — the guitar — and re-invented himself to land a record deal with MCA. He subbed for Vinnie Colaiuta on drums and years later played guitar with him for a jingle

He also was part of the heavy metal supergroup "The Dudes Of Wrath" along with Paul Stanley of Kiss and Tommy Lee of Motley Crue, who were specially assembled to record a song called Shocker from the movie of the same name.
