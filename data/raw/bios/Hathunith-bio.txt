Hathunith was formed in early 2010. The band started out playing covers of folk/pagan metal bands, but quickly moved on to writing own material.

The band's sound is influenced by bands such as Svartsot, Nomans Land, Windir, Kampfar and Moonsorrow.

In late 2010, recordings started for a first demo titled 'Þiudaspill', with lyrical themes about Germanic history and mythology.

A few languages are used in the band's lyrics, often corresponding with the subject. Those are Gothic (Þiudareiks & Austragutans), Swedish (Faran Från Havet), Old Norse (Eiríkr hinn Rauði) and English (Arminius & Glory of the Dead).  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hathunith">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
