Fight was formed in the summer of 1993 by vocalist Rob Halford (Judas Priest). Inspired by the brutal sound of Pantera during their 1991 tour, Rob steered the group in an aggressive, more American-styled direction of heavy metal.

Bad blood between Halford and the other members of Judas Priest caused the band to take a long break in 1992. At the time, Rob would produce the solo album on the side, and return to the band afterwards - that was the plan. However the relationship between Rob and Priest became steadily worse in 1992, and in September he was legally no longer part of the band.

In 1993 with his group assembled and material ready and written entirely by Halford, War of Words was released, and represented a much tougher type of metal with strong traces of Pantera's sound in effect. The Mutations EP was released in 1994 and contained some strong remixes of WoW tracks, plus 4 live tracks from a radio broadcast. 1995 saw Fight release their 3rd and final album, A Small Deadly Space which was far removed from their 1st effort and it was arguably when Fight became Fight. This time around the rest of the band contributed to the songwriting. Unfortunately the band broke up in the fall of 1995, despite having material prepared for a future CD.

Rob went on to be a part of 2 more solo-projects, Two and Halford before returning to Priest in 2003. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fight">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
