Death and Vanilla is a Swedish trio formed in Malmö, Sweden in 2007 by vocalist Marleen Nilsson and Anders Hansson, subsequently augmented with Magnus Bodin. Anders Hansson is a veteran of the Swedish music scene, having been in various bands since the 1980s and pursued as solo career as Love C.A. in the 1990s. He has produced a number of songs for the Eurovision Song Contest.

The trio has released five albums so far, starting with their eponymous debut in 2012. The critically acclaimed album "To Where the Wild Things Are...", released on Fire Records in 2015, provided the band with a wider audience. Their latest album "Are You A Dreamer?" was released in 2019.

Crackling recordings of old seances, inexplicably exploding tea cups... The supernatural is an important factor for Death And Vanilla as inspiration and methodological starting-point.  The band uses vintage musical equipment such as vibraphone, organ, mellotron, tremolo guitar and Moog, to emulate the sounds of 60s/70s soundtracks, library music, Krautrock, French Ye-ye pop, 60s psych and electronic pioneers from the golden age of analog synths. They play their music on instruments and amps from the Fifties, Sixties and Seventies, not only in order to recreate the sound and the atmosphere they love, but also to channel the ghostlike qualities in old spring reverbs and loose contacts. A kind of analog glitch, you might label their prac­tice. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Death+and+Vanilla">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
