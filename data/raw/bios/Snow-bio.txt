1) Snow (born Darrin O'Brien on October 30, 1968 in North York, Ontario) is an award-winning Canadian reggae musician. His music is an interplay between reggae, dancehall with toasting and singjaying.

One of his neighboring Jamaican families introduced him as a teenager to reggae and began calling him "Snow" and "Snow White". In 1988, Jamaican-born DJ Marvin Prince witnessed O'Brien deejaying at a party in Toronto and the two quickly became friends. His 1992 debut album was 12 Inches of Snow. MC Shan and Edmond Leary (Keyboards and writer) produced the entire album, apart from one track which was produced by John Ficarrotta. The album was produced shortly before Snow was imprisoned. Upon his release from prison, his first single "Informer", featuring MC Shan, was a #1 hit in the United States, Australia, and much of Europe. His follow-up single, "Girl I've Been Hurt", was a top 20 hit in the USA. He has just released songs sporadically after his wife passed away from cancer 2009.
