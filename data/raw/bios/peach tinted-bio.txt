peach tinted are a promising new band from Austria providing much appreciated sonic originality. Coming from a background of producing lofi hip hop beats, their approach to making indie rock music lets out sounds of synth-pop and dance inducing rhythms – as if 90’s grunge songs were sent to the future to be produced. For the duo of Emil Paiker and Louis Springer, last year’s pandemic allowed the opportunity to look inward and time to record and release their first EP, Cinematic Youth. From the wealth of singles released the year before to their current vibrational state, a number of different genres and profound emotional depth can be heard. Cinematic Youth was their lyrical debut, and while it was a short, four song project which leaned on their prowess as producers, Paiker’s vocals and Springer’s guitars tapped into an area of their artistry the world hadn’t seen yet and set the stage for what would come next. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/peach+tinted">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
