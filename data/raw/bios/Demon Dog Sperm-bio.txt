What can be said about a band called Demon Dog Sperm? Formed in 2005 with the line up of Sid (Vocals), Deron Christman (Guitar), Steve Lelong (Bass) and Dennis Christman (Drums) and later adding Chris Reinhart (Guitar) Demon Dog Sperm have been conquering the Pennsylvania metal scene. Having shared the stage with acts such as Clutch, Saliva, Exodus, Crisis, 3 Inches of Blood along with competing and winning the Van's Warped Tour Battle of the Bands in 2005, and securing themselves a spot on The Warped tour, they have grown their number of fans to huge proportions.

Demon Dog Sperm take heavy influences from the stoner metal and death metal scene, the most prominent being the oozing down tuned distortion of Acid Bath, Mortician and Six Feet Under and the song flow of Clutch, Hatebreed, and Nothingface. These influences give Demon Dog Sperm a solid music foundation and direction. Their triple vocalist attack, distinctive guitar sound, sonic bass and percussive assault combined with a even more powerful live show contribute to the bands originality. Demon Dog Sperm fills the missing piece you've always been looking for in metal but couldn't put your finger on it.

Demon Dog Sperm entered the studio in late 2006 to begin recording for their debut album on Open Grave Records which was released in November of 2007. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Demon+Dog+Sperm">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
