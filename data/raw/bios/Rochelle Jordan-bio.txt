Born in London, but raised on the Eastside of Toronto, singer/songwriter Rochelle Jordan is a pivotal figure in the future sound of R&B/pop.  A glorious anomaly in an era of brooding, gritty R&B, producing brash and buoyant feminist anthems,  Rochelle is known for her innovative yet throwback inspired, uncommon melody, lyrics, production and vocals.

Rochelle built a cult following with past releases including ROJO, the Origins EP (2011), PRESSURE (2012) and 1021 (2014). The results included critical acclaim from Billboard to Fader Magazine, countless blogs and award nominations including Sirius XM, MOBO, and BBC airplay. The PRESSURE track "Losing" would also go on to be sampled by rapper IamSu! on the song of the same name. After relocating to Los Angeles, Rochelle wrote & performed on Childish Gambino’s Grammy-nominated Because the Internet with the single "Telegraph Ave". Soon after, Rochelle charted number 1 on Billboard’s Next Big Sound in early 2014 with the single “Follow Me”. After teasing fans with a snippet of new music produced by Illangelo (Drake, The Weeknd,)  Rochelle released the KLSH produced single “Lowkey”.  A multi-talent, she has also lent her voice to Adult Swim's Black Dynamite as Cindy in "How Honeybee Got Her Groove Back".

After seven years of dealing with health complications as well as a stagnating record deal, her fourth album Play with the Changes was eventually released in April 2021, including the single "Next 2 You". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rochelle+Jordan">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
