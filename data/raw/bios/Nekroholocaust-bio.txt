The deathmachine Nekroholocaust was formed in 1987. At the last band meeting in 1989, it was decided to stop activities with the group before the next wave of trendy 90â€™s was to hit. Nearly 20 years later, all previously unreleased material was unearthed from the vaults and released, uncovering a dark jewel of Ancient Necro Nihilist History. Rituals of cold brutality & inhuman terror achievement. An Abomination of Destructive Death Kaos and Cold exploitation of Historic Human Atrocities. Total Death and Destruction to the worthless plague called the human race is what nekroholocaust desire.
