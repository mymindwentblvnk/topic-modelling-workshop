Carpe Tenebrum is the Black/Death Metal soloproject of the former Dimmu Borgir and Covenant guitarist Jamie Stinson, better known as Astennu. The first two Carpe Tenebrum albums got great reviews and response all over the world. This time, for his third outburst, Astennu returned to his Death Metal roots, and the result is a dark, brutal album, that rips everything on it's path to shreds. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Carpe+Tenebrum">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
