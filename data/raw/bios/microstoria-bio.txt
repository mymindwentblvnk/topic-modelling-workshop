Microstoria is a collaboration between Markus Popp (Oval) and Jan St. Werner (Mouse On Mars).
The resulting music is an electronic soundtrack, not without structure, not without melody. The "instruments " used are what could be seen as their successors- machines and digital technology. Where Oval eschews authorship of music, Microstoria explores authorship, especially in relation to improvisation. The tones used in composition are mechanized but paradoxically rich. The resulting pieces are organic in feel; a striking result when viewed in context with their origins. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Microstoria">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
