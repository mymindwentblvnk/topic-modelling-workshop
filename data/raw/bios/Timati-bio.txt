Timati (Timur Yunusov, born on August 15, 1983) is a Russian rapper, contemporary R&B music producer, and businessman from Moscow, Russia. Having been commercially successful in Russia and abroad, he collaborated with muliple popular artists from Western Europe and North America, including Snoop Dogg, P. Diddy, Xzibit, Busta Rhymes, Xzibit, Mario Winans, Craig David, Eve, Fat Joe, and DJ Antoine.

Timati started in 1998 as a member of hip-hop group VIP77, then worked as a backing MC for then famous Russian teenage rapper Децл around 1999, and finally became relatively popular with an R&B quartet Банда ("band" in Russian). His true success began in 2006 with the release of the debut solo album Black Star. The sophomore studio work The Boss featured many above-mentioned Western artists, thereby expanding his audience in Russia and beyond. His first international studio album SWAGG came out in 2012 and occupied Austrian, German, and Swiss charts.

Despite the commerical success, Timur Yunusov has been criticized for mediocrity and plagiarism. In particular, his track Наедине from the second album is essentially a translated version of Kanye West's Welcome to Heartbreak. Many critics consider Timati's success to be the result of massive infusion and manipulative advertisement.
