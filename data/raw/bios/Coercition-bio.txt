The band was born in Brive, France, in january 2006, with Antoine ( Drums ), Pedro ( Bass guitar), Clement ( Guitar and vocals ), and Noel ( Guitar ). After many repetitions, and three concerts in June, Pedro decide to leave the band ( but in very good terms ). So, in september, the band is pleased to welcome Paul in the band, as new bass player. The band write then new songs. In february 2007, we  record four songs, in order to share our music by Internet. In may 2007, we sign with the label Chabane's Records, and record our first real demo: "Pandemonium", available on our page. The returns are quiet good, and, after a few shows, the band decide to get back to work in order to write some new songs.

Coercition enters in studio in February 2008 in order to record their new MCD "Dysfunctional Oppression", avaible now since September 2008 on the label Chabane's Records. This time again, the CD is available in free download (check out our page!). 


The band is currently working on new songs, in order to record its debut album!
