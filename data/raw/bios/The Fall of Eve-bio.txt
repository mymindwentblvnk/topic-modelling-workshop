The Fall of Eve is an alternative music project formed by Laura Tracey (Evangeline) and Michael Moffat based in central Scotland. We use a fusion of weighty guitars, inspiring orchestration and celestial choral along with a female lead vocal to create beguiling melodies and rhythms that stay with you long after the music has stopped. All music and lyrics are written by Laura Tracey and Michael Moffat.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Fall+Of+Eve">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
