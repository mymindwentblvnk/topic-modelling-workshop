Dutch/Spanish (Dutch born) producer, party organizer & DJ/live.
He’s the bad boy of the Amsterdam techno underground: Daniel Sanchez, 24 year old son of a Spanish father and a Dutch mother, who scored one of the biggest hits of the summer of 2007 with the infectious ‘Mumbling yeah’. Daniel’s ‘mumbling’ vocals give the track that special edge.
When Dylan Hermelyn (2000 and One), head of the 100% Pure and Remote Area-labels heard ‘Mumbling yeah’ for the first time, he immediately signed Daniel for his brand new Area Remote label.

Although ‘Mumbling yeah’ is Sanchez’ first record, he’s been around for quite some time and made his name as a dj, party organiser and as one of the key figures of the burgeoning Amsterdam minimal and techno scene. His successful Rotzooii and Blabla parties – held amongst others in Studio 80, Stubnitz, Bunker and Westerunie - are among the best underground-events Amsterdam has to offer.

But with ‘Mumbling yeah’ one of the best selling singles of 2007, Sanchez now focuses more time on his production and dj career. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Daniel+Sanchez">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
