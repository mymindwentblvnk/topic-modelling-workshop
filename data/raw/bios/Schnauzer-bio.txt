Schnauzer  is a Thrash/Grind/Scrapmetal band out of Cleveland, Ohio - PARMA, to  be exact. These idiots have been playing the raw energy of punk, the ferocity of grind-core and the heaviness of death metal since 1988-89 and mix it all together to make what they call SCRAPMETAL. 

RIDICULOUS subject matter, vocals and lyrics make this listening experience quite enjoyable, and at live show, vocalist, drummer and founding member  Jim Konya (Jim Sadist) likes to antagonize the audience with his chatter.
