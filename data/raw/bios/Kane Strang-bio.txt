Kane Strang is an artist from Dunedin, New Zealand. He co-founded the band Dinasour Sanctuary with his friends with whom he released A Public Toilet Told Me Nothing Gets Better. Strang transferred to Germany and released his first solo recording. This demo reel: A Pebble and A Paper Crane was recorded in a German WW2 bunker by teenage Strang for inspiration. He recorded it in a German language program (which he doesn't speak) and the bomb shelter's lights turned off on a timer, frequently leaving Strang sitting in the dark. "Winded" a song on the demo reel, was ranked #3 on Pop Lib's top 10 songs of 2013.

His first album, Blue Cheese, was recorded while house-sitting. Because Strang recorded it there, the sound comes across as a "restless soul taking full advantage of the empty environs by making an inspired racket and broadcasting his innermost musings to no one in particular" according to a review in Pitchfork. Strang's unique musical styles drew the eye of indie super-label Dead Oceans, with whom he would release his second album. Two Hearts No Brain, his second album, was recorded in the notoriously haunted Chick's Hotel Studio, it was his first studio recording. His first single "Oh, So You're Off I see" was released alongside his first album.Strang has since toured the United States and Europe, the United States was his first tour outside of New Zealand. Strang says that he wants to keep things fresh, and doesn't want to continue making the same thing: "I didn't want to make Blue Cheese 2." 

Along with international recognition, Strang's song "My Smile is Extinct" has 6.5 million views on youtube. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kane+Strang">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
