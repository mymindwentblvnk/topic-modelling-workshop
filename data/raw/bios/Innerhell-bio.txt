INNERHELL is a bulgarian Dark Ambient/Pagan Black Metal project which plays in the traditions of BATHORY's music, but it has its own emotion in it. The whole music process is made by Valsidalf Innerhell. INNERHELL has two demos: "Lost Memories" (2003) and "...like the beasts...themselves..." (2004) and a full-length release - "Eney Of The World"(2006). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Innerhell">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
