Колесо Дхармы

Dharma Wheel is one of the first straight edge hardcore bands in Russia. The leader and vocalist of the band for many years is Punch, who rallied the punk community of Volzhsky in the mid-90s. Since the 2000s the band has been based in Finland and performs under the name Wheel of Dharma. The legacy of the band, whose performances and first recordings date back to the early 90s, is hard to overestimate, it became a cornerstone of the DIY scene formation in Russia. The band has always taken a clear anti-fascist stance, never separating politics from music, and music from action.

The band's performance at the Yebi Systema Fest, announced in 2013, did not take place. The band hasn't performed in Russia for quite a long time. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wheel+of+Dharma">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
