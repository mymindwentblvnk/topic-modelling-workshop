Human existence's instability, everyday's life's repetiveness which lead to madness, addiction to a system made of useless human values. After years of slavery, mind wakes up and flies, and its gateway is in Dodskammer, in simplicity, in misanthropy and most of all in consciousness of the existence of a way of flight.
Music of "Room of death" pays always attention to melody and simplicity, for example voice which sets growls against pure and simply spoken words, never looking for unnatural or complex solutions.
Everything was born as a chapter of a diary, was born to live only one day, but to be reminded forever. Dodskammer was born to bestow great honours upon bands playing real Music, without posing as masters or heroes.
Band consists of one member, TrOn, who recorded and mixed in Some Studios his first promo called "Innocence", licensed by Sinque Prod.
Then in 2004 TrOn released his second work called "Serenity". 5 songs of doom black metal plus a Darktrhone cover. His black metal has become more sad and cold, with no baroques or music complications.
Slow black metal in Filosofem's Burzum style. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dodskammer">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
