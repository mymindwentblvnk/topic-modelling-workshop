In a world where no god watches or guides, humankind is left to itself like orphaned children. And in this world, horror and cruelty of every unspeakable kind lives and breathes. These horrors are echoed in the music of Deus Otiosus.

 

Musically the band can be described as classic death metal. Not that Deus Otiosus reproduce any overdone old school sound, but they strive for the same values that the made death metal pioneers great: Unique identity, well-roundedness and songwriting prowess.
