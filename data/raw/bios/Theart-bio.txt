formerly The Follow, members of Australiaâ€™s popular rock band recently moved to Los Angeles only to reincarnate themselves, and reemerge as THE ART. In doing so, the band has recently released their debut self titled EP, and are currently in the studio recording their first full length album.

Producer Nick Launay (Nick Cave, Supergrass, Yeah Yeah Yeahs) has teamed up with the band, releasing the EP on his own label, Stick It To The Man. Fusing art rock with harmonies to awaken your spirit, THE ART dominate any stage they take with their unconventionally defiant independence and raw power.
