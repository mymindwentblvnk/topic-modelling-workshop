Darkness looms deep over the frozen wasteland of the far North; a savage land eternally covered in ever-deepening layers of ice and snow.

The sun has set, though today, it scarcely rose above the horizon; its feeble rays granting small comfort to the gaunt and wretched creatures scraping out an existence in the tundra. Below the mountains, a threatening mist begins to crawl through damp, black forests.

Tonight, one has journeyed far into the heart of the wilderness. He is one who seeks vengeance and death. By the fire he waits, shrouded in shadow, his thoughts darkened by the poison of memory… the flash of teeth, hair and blood. The screams of death and suffering. For the dead it is too late, much too late.

Padded footprints in the snow. Their trail has led him here.

Tonight your doom is upon you, tonight your debt is paid.

Tonight you meet Wolf Hunter.
