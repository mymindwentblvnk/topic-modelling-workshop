Bald-headed Da Hool (real name Frank Tomiczek) was a child of the exploding German club scene of the late '80s. Born and raised in the largely working-class town of Bottrop, it was here where he first wowed the crowds with his skills behind the turntables. By 1990, he was already being touted as one of the nation's finest men on the decks and, that same year, moved into production. His early works, released under the moniker DJ Hooligan, included the popular club numbers "B.O.T.T.R.O.P." and "It's a Dream Song," and the dance charts winner "Rave Nation." In 1996, he launched his own label, B-sides, and changed his name to Da Hool. That same year, he released the infectious rave single "Meet Her at the Love Parade." However, it was not until a year later, when the tune was re-released on Germany's legendary Kosmo Records label (responsible for such acts as Novy vs Eniac), that it became a chart topper. It sold more than 6,000,000 copies around the globe. Soon after came Da Hool's next offering, another rave single titled "Bora Bora"; named after a beach on the Spanish party island of Ibiza, the track was a popular club tune in many countries and a hit on the German charts. In 1999, he released his first LP, the aptly titled Here Comes Da Hool.
