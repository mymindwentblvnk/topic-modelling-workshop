There is more than one artist with this name: (1) a mid-'90s emo band, (2) 90's metal band

(1) The Emo band Floodgate formed in Santa Cruz, California. The lineup consisted of Andrew Gilbert [Guitar, Vocals], Michael Baker [Bass] and Thomas Brayton [Drums]. They released an LP on Ebullition in 1995 called 'Troubles A' Brewin' and a Double 7" called 'I choose danger' with No Idea Records the same year. "At rest" was also released on the "Blindspot" compilation CD on No Idea/ Toybox Records in 1997. Driven and heartfelt punk with catchy songwriting, the band features members of Campaign, the Fisticuffs Bluff and The Notorious Love Affair. 

(2) Kyle Thomas was the man behind Exhorder, an early-90's metal band that has been widely acclaimed as the originator of the modern Pantera sound. With his later band Floodgate, Thomas opted for a different sound, as Penalty featured a modern Sabbath sound with a slight Southern flavor, similar to fellow southerners such as Corrosion Of Conformity or Down. Though a shade short on songwriting variety, the album was a pretty good first effort, but the band never recorded again. Thomas was later to put efforts into reforming Exhorder, but now (as of April 2005) has a new band called Pitts vs Preps. In 2006 Kyle Thomas became the new Alabama Thunderpussy singer  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Floodgate">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
