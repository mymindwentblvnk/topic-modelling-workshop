To announce the upcoming release of their sophomore EP, “A Million Years Under the Sun” on June 30, Winchester are releasing their first single, “Midnight Oil” for free download. The genre-bending sounds of “Midnight Oil” articulate an indefinable palette of electronic, cinematic and symphonic sounds, equally worthy of basement rock stages or the dance floor. From wailing guitars to delicious dance beats, Winchester brings home their unique vision of carefully calculated chaos.

After releasing their first EP, dubbed “Disassembling Rainbows” by Stars’ Amy Milan, Winchester closed off 2011 with airplay on 88.3 CJIQ FM and their appearance on Care Humphries’ Indie Rock Invasion Show, where she described their sound as “so different”. Winchester then brought in the New Year, making track #39 on Indie Rock Playlist’s January 2012 collection, picking up an internet following overnight. After a brief hiatus in 2012 as Lauren relocated to Peru and Monty moved to Rotterdam, the duo are now back together in Toronto to release “A Million Years Under the Sun”.

The duo came together in Toronto in 2010 after years of working together, self-producing their first EP—Disassembling Rainbows.  Together, Lauren and Monty blend their love of rock and electronic music with the meticulousness of classical music and the accessibility of pop music. Between them they utilize their experience in classical piano, classical guitar, vocals, rock guitar, fiddle, music theory, DJing, and synthesizer programming to craft their unique sound from an immense range of influences. 

Now, after two years of labor they have once again self recorded, produced, and mastered what will be their second EP—“A Million Years Under the Sun”. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Winchester">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
