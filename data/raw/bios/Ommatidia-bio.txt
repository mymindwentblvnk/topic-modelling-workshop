French metallers OMMATIDIA are presenting a refreshing blend of Gothic, Doom and Atmospheric Metal on their debut album. Although the band's name might not ring a bell, OMMATIDIA is no newcomer since it is the offspring of former THE OLD DEAD TREE members Nicolas Chevrollier (guitar) and Vincent Danhier (bass). No wonder, then, that "In This Life, Or The Next" often reminds the listener of the much regretted Parisian act, disbanded late 2009. To achieve such a masterful debut, Vincent and Nicolas joined forces with vocalist Guillaume Richard (Dustbowl), guitarist Gilles Vardon (Jarell) and drummer Olivier Rouget (Sinn). Ranging from Paradise Lost through heavenwood and Katatonia to My Dying Bride, the basic influences of this young band bring a solid, traditional mid-nineties Gothic Metal flavor, enriched with their very own French touch! Founded in Paris in 2009, OMMATIDIA will surprise all Melodic Dark Metal fans with "In This Life, Or The Next", a first album filled with catchy crushing riffs and pure, genuine melancholy. A splendid dark gem not to be missed!
