2) Forerunners of a unique subgenre of punk rock known as 'murder-mystery punk', Skint Little Knuckles were a 4 piece  collective based in Central scotland ( members living in Alloa, Stirling and Bo'ness ) that existed from 2001 - 2004.

The band consisted of Ali Stalker on vocals and telecaster, Gordon Stalkeer on bass, Brandon (casper) Walker on Les Paul and Macduff on Drums and vocals.

The band self-released two discs. The first being a primitive, lo-fi affair ( recorded early in their career when still a three piece ) recorded mostly live with minimal fuss, and plenty of fuzz. This disc was called 'Reality Bites'. Hailed by rock critics near and far for it's 'less is more' DIY ethic.

The second release ( on the central scotland based-indie DIY label 'WhoDunnit records' ) was a mix of live ( recorded at the now under new management Strawberry fields, in Glasgow) tracks and new studio tracks. This, as far as i am aware at this moment in time was called 'Looking at me sideways' and featured a confused store dug on the front cover.

Tracks 'reflections'(live) and 'City Life' made it onto the now lengendry Centralscene.co.uk Compilation Vol.1, released March 2005.
