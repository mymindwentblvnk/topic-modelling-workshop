Pro-Pain is a New York City-based hardcore band formed in 1991 by vocalist and bassist Gary Meskil and drummer Dan Richardson, both former members of Crumbsuckers. Their debut album 'Foul Taste of Freedom' was released in 1992, displaying hardcore punk and rap metal influences, after which the band was signed to Roadrunner Records, who reissued the album the following year. Their second album 'The Truth Hurts' was initially banned due to the sleeve artwork, featuring a picture of a stitched-up woman after an autopsy. The band has released several more albums with a varying line-up over the years. They have released albums on Roadrunner, Nuclear Blast, Candlelight, Spitfire, and SPV Steamhammer.
