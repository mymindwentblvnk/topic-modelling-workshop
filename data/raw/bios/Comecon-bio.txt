Comecon were a Swedish death metal band active in the early 1990s. Rasmus Ekman and Pelle Ström, who shared guitars & bass duties, were the only members to play on the 3 albums the band released. They never had a real drummer (utilizing programmed drums instead), and every album featured a different singer, each time a well-known name from the death metal scene. On their first effort, 1992's "Megatrends in Brutality", vocals were handled by Lars-Göran Petrov, who had just left Entombed (only to rejoin Entombed a bit later). On 1993's "Converging Conspiracies", the singer is Martin van Drunen, formerly of Pestilence, who also sung in Asphyx and had a brief stint in Bolt Thrower. Finally, on 1995's "Fable Frolic", van Drunen's successor is Marc Grewe, member of the German death metal outfit Morgoth. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Comecon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
