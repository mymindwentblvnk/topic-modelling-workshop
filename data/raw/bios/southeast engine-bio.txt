Southeast Engine was formed in 2000 by Adam "Rem" Remnant (lead vocals, guitar) and Leo DeLuca (drum kit, percussion). Both attended the same high school in Dayton, Ohio and grew up in "The Gem City" during its musical heyday of the 1990s. Underground bands like Guided By Voices, Brainiac, and Swearing At Motorists made significant and long-standing impressions upon the two youngsters.

Around 2000, the pair moved to Athens, Ohio and were equally inspired by the Appalachian old-timey and folk music of the area. Thus, Southeast Engine is a unique hybrid of the Dayton, Ohio musical underground and the Athens, Ohio folk scene.

Longstanding member, Michael Lachman (keyboards, Wandering Genie) began playing with the band soon after its formation. The three are now joined by Jesse Remnant (Adam's younger brother) on bass guitar and harmony vocals. Josh Antonuccio played on, engineered, and helped produce the group's last two records at 3 Elliott Studio in Athens, Ohio. Conrad Dillon played on, engineered, and helped produce the group's first 2 records at 178 N. Congress St. in Athens, Ohio.

The Wrens (Absolutely Kosher Records) have been pivotal to Southeast Engine's progression. The two bands played together for the first time in 2005. Charles Bissell, one of the songwriters for The Wrens, really took to Southeast Engine's music and lead the band to Cory Brown of Absolutely Kosher / Misra Records. The band signed to Misra in February of 2007 and released A Wheel Within A Wheel later that year.

From the Forest to the Sea is the title of the group's next album. Recording will commence in an abandoned 1800s high school auditorium in the heart of Appalachian Ohio. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Southeast+Engine">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
