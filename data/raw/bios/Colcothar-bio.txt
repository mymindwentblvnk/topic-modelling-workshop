The history of Colcothar starts when guitar players Matthias Stocke and Thomas Vanhaesebroeck met and discovered their mutual intrest in death metal. After recruiting several people from other bands Thomas had played in (Xavier Verleye on drums, Xavier Deschuyter on vocals and Kevin on bass), a first line-up was formed in 2001.

In the following years, numerous line-up changes came, that eventually led to Colcothar as it is now. A death metal band that wants to please to the ears while crushing the guts, a mix of different flavours and emotions, served on a death metal dish.
The line-up:

Gratien Versypt: vocals
Thomas Vanhaesebroeck: guitar
Thomas 'Krul' Hauttekeete: guitar
Peter Van Daele: bass
Maarten Nachtergaele: drums <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Colcothar">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
