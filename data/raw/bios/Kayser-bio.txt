There are currently two bands named Kayser.

1. Kayser saw the first ray of light in early June 2004 when Spice (ex Spiritual Beggars), Mattias Svensson (also The Defaced), Bob Ruben (ex The Mushroom River Band) and Fredrik Finnander decided to join forces.

Originating from the pens of Spice and Svensson, Kayser enforces the pillars of metal with absolute authority. Focus always lies on the song, easily identifiable through the supreme vocals by Spice, though the emotional and musical expressions stretch from heavy introvert pounding to pure hate driven ferocity.

Kayser is under the wings of the Scarlet family and recorded their debut album KaiserhofJanuary 18th 2005. The recordings took place in Caesar studios (Soilwork, The Defaced and more). The release was in June 2005.

In the fall of 2005 Fredrik Finnander left Kayser and Helsingborg guitarist Jokke Pettersson joined in. Jokke really loved the music and found his place right away.

In February 2006 Kayser went in the studio to record their most recent album "Frame the world...Hang it on the wall" again with Richard Larsson in his Caesar Studios. The release was on October 16th 2006.

In August 2006 Helsingborg bassplayer Ewil Sandin joined Kayser.
