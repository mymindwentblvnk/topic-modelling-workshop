Three artists with this name: 
1) Canadian rock/pop band
2) American emo band
3) UK Post-black metal/hardcore

1) Formed in Edmonton, AB in 2010, Rend is a 5 piece, electrifying Rock/Pop band. Picture a dash of Metric, a scoop of Coldplay, a layer of Paramore topped off with The Cranberries. When you listen to Rend you get a new experience with every song. They are a Canadian band inspired to inspire. You will hear driving rhythms, Zeppelin worthy guitar solos, synth pop hook lines, and dynamic, Soulful vocals. Backed by Rawlco Radio through the 10K20 project, Rend released their debut album "No Lines" on February 25th, 2012.
