Intergalactic lovers is brought to you by a collective of four good crazy individuals from all over this globe. We met in the suburbs, all part of the same scouts; hoarsing and fooling around until one of us had the great idea to start playing music somewhere else than in a field. Lara Chedraoui (vocals, guitar), Brendan Corbey (drums), Maarten Huygens (guitar, bass) and Raf De Mey (guitar bass) are Intergalactic Lovers. Our goal is to uplift the monotony of the hum drum life we so easily get sucked into. Hope that our sound will help you kill the time on whatever it is you might or might not be waiting for! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Intergalactic+Lovers">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
