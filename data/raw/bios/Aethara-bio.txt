Virtue is available on the free compilation city of screaming spires: vol 1

Aethara are a band from Oxford, UK. They are Ben Gross (Vocals, Bass), Ted Hewett (Vocals, Drums), Shawn Reiszner (Guitar, Vocals) and James Whitmarsh (Guitar, Vocals), and formed in June 2009. Their new EP, Disconnected, is set to be released in Summer 2011. 

They base their sound around Gothenburg-style melodeath, and straight metal. The guitars focus on the melodeath side of the genre, taking influence from bands like In Flames and Soilwork, the drums take strong influence from the more technical styles of Chris Adler (Lamb of God) and progmetal work of Protest The Hero, and the vocals take inspiration from bands including Scar Symmetry, Across the Sun and As I Lay Dying

Currently the band are gigging extensively, awaiting the release of the Disconnected EP, with a view to breaking into the genre nationwide over the coming months.
