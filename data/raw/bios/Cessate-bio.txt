Cessate (sess-ATE). Five people who have dedicated everything about themselves to support the underground metal scene and their own music - often asked what the band's name means - would likely say that you must witness the passion they convey, to truely understand. Formed in March of 2003 - by members Justin, Cheech, Chad, Harley and Peter - Cessate has come a long way from their humble roots in small town Saskatchewan. From sharing the stage with some of the worlds top metal bands - such as Cryptopsy, Vader, Neuraxis, Decapitated, Into Eternity, Dew Scented - to headlining nearby festivals, they have managed to become a leader of their provinces fast-growing metal community.

In July of 2004 Cessate recorded their debut E.P. entitled "Our Ungodly Descent" and released it that summer at the Georgestock festival. The recording showed the intent and potential of the band, and paved the way for making of the full length album less than a year later. This self produced, self financed album, "Shattered Hopes" is a milestone for Cessate, and shows immense musical growth - having honed their playing, and tightened every aspect of their writing. The signature sound of Cessate is that of death metal - but done unlike anyone else - mixing in guitar driven elements of everything from power/prog metal to thrash to classic rock.
