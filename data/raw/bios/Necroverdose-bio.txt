Necroverdose is a French brutal death metal band that released their first full effort called 'Off' in 2012. With their sound they try and capture the sound of brutal sounding 90s death metal like Suffocation, Cannibal Corpse and Malevolent Creation. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Necroverdose">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
