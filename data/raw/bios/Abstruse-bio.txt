There is more than one musical act that goes by Abstruse.(http://www.last.fm/music/Abstruse).  One of them is an experimental group comprised of Doug & Laurel, a husband and wife team originally from Minnesota who relocated to Texas.  They use experimental loops, sounds, and noise that can be likened to Muslimgauze and Vedisni (of which Doug is a former founding member).  Their only known release happens to be "Duck & Cover", on "I-Celestial-Insect" a Doctsect compilation.

The photo that appears though is from the metal bands' 2007 Transgression release.


for the band that plays extreme/avant-garde metal :
