Ayodele Ajayi Eriksson (born September 29, 1974), also known as Ayo, is a former Swedish hip hop artist and pioneer of the Swedish hip hop scene. Ayodele was born in Nigeria to a Swedish mother and Nigerian father, but moved to Sweden with his mother at a young age. Ayodele started rapping in 1989. His first record was released in 1992, which was made under the group name One Eye-Q=Young Wizdom, a group he had with Andreas Melin, also known as Broadcaster D. The group was disbanded in the same year, due to record label complications leading to their debut album never being released.

Ayodele reemerged in 1999 with his solo debut album "Föder Nåt Nytt", under the name Ayo. The album was a success with hit singles such as "Betongdjungelboken" and "Många som väntar". His sophomore album was titled "Del 2: Uppföljaren" and was meant to be released in 2001, but due to further label issues it was never released. It includes singles "Det spökar" and "Ayooo". Ayo eventually decided to quit the music scene and converted to Islam. Today he lives in Dubai and works as an instructor for Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. He released one last song in 2011, on Swedish hip hop producer  Stress's album "Playlist". On the song "Mitt beslut" ("My decision"), Ayo explains his decision to quit music.
