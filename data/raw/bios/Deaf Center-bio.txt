Deaf Center are collaborators Erik K Skodvin (AKA Svarte Greiner, xhale, Solitaire albread) and Otto A Totland (AKA supine, nest), operating out of Norway since 2003. Old classmates, they finally decided to write music together and ended up creating the Neon City EP, soon followed by the full length album, Pale Ravine.
