OSIRION is an old school Black metal band from Savoie (France), born in November 2001 by the will of Turannos (6 strings) to spread the True Black Metal spirit, in opposition to the present and commercial B.M.. Before having set up Osirion, Turannos has created or integrated several extreme metal bands (Among whom Animus Herilis). He was first helped by Nieluge (Voices & 6 strings), Maldoror (Bass) and Barbituric (Drums), who allowed the band to play live until 2006. 
Ever since, the line-up has changed : Nieluge was replaced by Valharik (Voices & 6 strings) in 2003, Barbituric by Sm√∂g, and Maldoror helped by Syllath (Bass session).
