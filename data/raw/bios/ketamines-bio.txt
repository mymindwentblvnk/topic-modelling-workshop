Being reincarnated as the evil union between seminal Lethbridge garage bands Endangered Ape and Myelin Sheaths is not a bad thing. If anything, Paul Lawton and James Leroy’s newest and most accessible collaboration to date is a welcome break from the usual too-serious landscape of the current southern Alberta punk scene. Instead of struggling to the top of the heap imitating any number of buzz worthy garage or hardcore bands, Lawton and Leroy have put a unique spin on surf-music and claimed it for their own.

Getting early support from Chicago label HoZac records, with their smash single “Line by Line” (available now on 7” & soon to be featured in a nation television ad), the Ketamines are now anticipating the Febraury 2012 release of their full length LP on Oakland, California’s Southpaw records. Currently delighting audiences with drunken antics and spaced out jams across North America as a three-piece band, the Ketamines are heading in to the final year on the Mayan calendar with confidence it is just the beginning.
