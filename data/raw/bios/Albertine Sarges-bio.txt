Albertine Sarges is a singer songwriter from Berlin. After numerous collaborative projects, including Holly Herndon and Itaca, Albertine brings together a new band, the titular Sticky Fingers for their debut LP. Albertine grew up in Kreuzberg during the fall of the Berlin Wall and records in nearby Neuk√∂lln - but from there its branches shoot out to take in feminist theory, musings on bisexuality, gender stereotypes, depression and mental health.
