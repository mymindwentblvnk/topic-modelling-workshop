Stereo Virgins are a grunge band from Merseyside, England. The group consists of Stuart Sinclair (vocals/guitar), Rachel Alveston (vocals/guitar), Beck Alveston (bass) and Lyam Kirkham (drums).

Stereo Virgins are part of a new generation of bands that are breathing new life into the Liverpool rock scene. Their sound firmly based within the heart of grunge, they deliver a unique brand of catchy melodies and fuzz-laden riffs.

The band first surfaced in 2007, existing as outsiders, in a scene that had long been dominated by the ‘scouse-rock’ sound. Tired of having the same old thing imposed upon them, SV refused to conform and now, through their tireless efforts, the city is beginning to take notice.

Promotion of the band has solely relied on the band themselves, pursuing a campaign of their own shows and more recently, securing slots supporting artists such as Dave MacPherson (INME), Japanese Voyeurs and Die So Fluid.

The band are hoping to spread their wings in the near future, playing shows in other cities. They already have a few prospects lined up… so stay tuned!
