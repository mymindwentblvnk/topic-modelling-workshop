Belbury Poly is Jim Jupp, who co-runs the Ghost Box (UK) record label with Julian House (The Focus Group).  Belbury Poly's music recalls the churning synth sounds and dreamy analog forays of the 60s vanguard.  Similar in tone and texture to Raymond Scott and the whole of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop's 60s-70s output, Belbury Poly offers off-key melodies, muted rhythms and sounds both hopeful and spooky.
