About
“Scorched By The Flaming Goat” is a Blackened Death Metal / Symphonic Deathcore band from Santiago Chile, is a new band that shows us their talent, giving us their new song “Colossal Decadence”
This band is influenced by bands like:
Hematidrosis, Make Them Suffer, Winds Of Plagues, Abigail Williams, The Black Dahlia Murder, Fleshgod Apocalypse
The new song is similar to these bands. I recognize that they have a good keyboard and excellent voice.
