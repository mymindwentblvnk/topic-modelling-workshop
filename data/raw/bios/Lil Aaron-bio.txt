Dubbed ‘one of the music industry best kept (and weirdest) secrets’ by Pigeons and Planes, lil aaron built an intitial enigmatic reputation after he dropped out of high school to tour with scene bands and left Indiana to pen hits for artists including  Liam Payne, Blackbear, Big Boi, KIIARA, Kim Petras  and Jeremih. 2016 saw the birth of lil aaron as an artist in the eyes of the public with his Y2K collaboration ‘DAMN’ which was met with praise by peers and new fans alike, leading into his debut project ‘GLOING PAIN$’ released on Halloween 2016 before heading out on the road to tour North America with acts including Blackbear, 24hrs and KIIARA. Reflecting on the success of his first release and the stand out record ‘DRUGS’, he wanted to focus on paying homage to the scene he grew up in. The next few months were a process of writing over 100 new records and ultimately cutting them down to a handful of his best for the next release ‘ROCK$TAR FAMOU$’ which he released on his birthday May 31, 2018 on his newly formed label ‘HAZHEART RECORDS’. “ROCK$TAR FAMOU$ saw features from Kim Petras, KIIARA,  Rico Nasty and pop-punk legend, Travis Barker  of Blink 182 and was met with huge support from old fans as well as newly adopted support from the punk/emo scene, with print interview in AP magazine, a spot on Warped Tour’s Farewell run and heading out with 3OH3! on their run with EMONITE. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lil+Aaron">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
