X-Pulssion consists of four Finnish musicians: Rayburn Thrashfield, Ace Wilder, Animal Rocket and Jake Oldman. Together they form a powerful and heavy sound mix where rhythm sections are dominated by heavy riffs that rolls forward like a wrecking ball. After all itâ€™s all about just having fun. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/x-pulssion">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
