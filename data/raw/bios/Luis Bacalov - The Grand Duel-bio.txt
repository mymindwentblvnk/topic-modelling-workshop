Luis Enrique Bacalov is an Argentine composer of film scores. Early on in his career, he composed scores for Spaghetti Western films, including Django, Storm Rider and The Price of Power.

Bacalov has been nominated twice for Academy Awards: for Scoring of Music--adaptation or treatment for The Gospel According to St. Matthew in 1967 and winning the award for Original Music Score for Il Postino in 1996.

In more recent years, Bacalov has composed works for chorus and orchestra, including his Misa Tango , a work setting a Spanish-language adaptation of the classic liturgical Mass to the tango rhythms of his native Argentina. 
Two of his songs were used in Quentin Tarantino's film Kill Bill.
