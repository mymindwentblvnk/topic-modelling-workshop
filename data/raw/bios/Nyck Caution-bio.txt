Born and raised in Brooklyn, Nyck Caution made a name for himself as a member of the Pro Era collective. Impressing with his crystal-clear bars and malleable flows, the 26-year-old rapper became a fixture of the NYC rap scene in the 2010s, appearing on projects by Joey Bada$$ (including the popular 1999), as well as Beast Coast's Escape From New York and A$AP Mob's Cozy Tapes Vol. 2. He connected with Pro Era producer/rapper Kirk Knight for Nyck @ Knight, generating tens of millions of streams on Spotify alone. This summer, Nyck showed a new side of himself with the Open Flame EP, which earned coverage in Complex, NME, HotNewHipHop, and more. The proper follow-up to his solo 2016 debut Disguise The Limit, Nyck is ready to establish himself as an artistic force with Anywhere But Here.

Delivering evocative lyrics with an ice-cold demeanor, Caution is preparing to make the leap. Steeped in the culture of his home borough, Anywhere But Here reverberates with booming bass notes and crisp percussion, delivering a spin on classic NY rap sounds seasoned with Nyck's wry sense of humor and incisive storytelling. The project is home to "How You Live It," a hard-hitting new single with an appearance from Nyck's Pro Era cohort Joey Bada$$. Featuring further guest spots from Denzel Curry, Kota The Friend, GASHI, TheMind, CJ Fly, Elbee Thrie of Phony Ppl, and more, Anywhere But Here arrives on January 15th via Pro Era Records/ADA Worldwide. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nyck+Caution">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
