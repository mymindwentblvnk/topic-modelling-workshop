Tazer is a boring band located in Blacksburg, Virginia. Their original songs are dull and clunky, the type of sound you'd expect to hear if you threw a laundry machine off a cliff. Their originals follow fairly closely on the instrumentals, but sadly the singing is tainted with the creaks and whines that affect their lead singer, a disease most believe is called "puberty". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tazer">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
