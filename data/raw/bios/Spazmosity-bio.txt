Spazmosity was founded in the fall of 1994 by the two guitarists Thelberg and Lamming. The band quickly evolved from playing covers to writing their own music in the death and black metal genré. After a few concerts Emanuelsson joined as a singer, and 1998 saw the addition of bass player Mordström. In 2003 their third and highly critically acclaimed demo Storm Metal was released. During all this time they gigged whenever possible and shared stage with, among others, Amon Amarth, Lobotomy, Vinterland, Watain, Throneaeon and Entombed.

After a period of line up problems, the summer of 2006 saw the addition of drummer Dimman, who brought energy and motivation to the band. Risen from the ashes, they started to write new songs and plan for the future. The following year was filled with gigs together with bands like Carnal Forge, Insision, Grave and Necrophobic. In March 2008 it was time to record what had been accomplished so far. Spazmosity entered Studio Soulless and recorded a promo CD containing three songs sharing the common lyrical theme of tremendous terror and death!

A year later Spazmosity entered Necromorbus studio to record their first full length album.
Welcome Death.
The album is to be released on Khaosmaster Productions in 2010.

After the album recording Spazmosity and Emanuelsson parted ways. It was a hard process for the band after so many good years together. An old friend of the band, Ola Lindgren (Grave), took over the microphone in 2009. Ola of course brings new dimensions to the vocals in Spazmosity. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Spazmosity">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
