There are more than one artist that go by the name of Break.

1.) Acquiring a love for the breakbeat through jazz and funk records, Break took to the drums at a young age, learning piano along the way and taking to the turntables at the age of fourteen.

A talented musician with a wide range of influences, Break looks to push the barriers in whatever he’s doing. Crisp breaks, heavy bass and strong melody are stable marks of his productions making him a firm favourite with a variety of the scenes top DJs.

Break hooked up with the DNAudio crew back in 2001 after meeting Squire through mutual friends. Since then he has played an important role in the label’s expansion, working closely with Silent Witness in developing a fresh & devastating new sound.
DJ A-Sides was quick to sign Break’s debut, Cocktail for the ‘East Side Jamz 2’ LP and wasted no time releasing his first solo twelve, ‘Sticky Situation’, the ‘Breakout EP’ and a string of other singles.
