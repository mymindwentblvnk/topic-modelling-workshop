Artist 1:
Athens, Ohio and later Cincinnati-based power pop trio (active 1991 - 1995).  
Pat O'Callaghan (vocals, guitar), Greg Tudor (vocals, bass), and Mike Tittel (vocals, drums) were childhood friends from the East Side of Cincinnati, Ohio and formed the band at  Ohio University in Athens, Ohio.

Often reminiscent of Pet Sounds-era Beach Boys, the dBs, King Crimson, The Raisins, and even occasional hints of British pub rock, BEER was a virtual Waring blender of pop influences.  After the breakup of BEER, O'Callaghan and Tittel went on to form Pidgin.  Tittel also served as the tour drummer for the Loud Family in 1996.  Tudor went on to perform a variety of roles, both live and in the studio, with bands such as Cari Clara, Turnbull ACs, and Roger Klug.  Currently, Tittel and Tudor have been reunited as a rhythm section supporting pop-virtuoso Roger Klug.
