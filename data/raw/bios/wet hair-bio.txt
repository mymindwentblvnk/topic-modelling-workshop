Wet Hair is Shawn Reed, Justin Thye, and Ryan Garbes, the two remaining members of Raccoo-oo-oon that stayed in Iowa City after the band's end. Reed also runs Night-People Records, which Garbes often contributes to. Wet Hair began as a solo outing for Reed in late 2007 during the final months of Raccoo-oo-oon, and after the release of a 12" EP and the Irifi Cassette Garbes was added on organ and live drums. Wet Hair has evolved over time shifting the bands sound steadily towards  a more refined  pop sensibility. An experimental attitude and psychedelic atmosphere still prevails in Wet Hair's music and the core instrumentation of the band has largey stayed consitent throughout with Reed on vocals, synth, drum machine, + tapes and Garbes on live drums, + synth/organ. 

To date Wet Hair has released a 12" EP on Night-People, three cassettes on Night-People, the LP's Dream and Glass Fountain on Not Not Fun, a split 7" with Peaking Lights on Not Not Fun, a split 7" with Rene Hell on Bathetic, and a split LP with Naked on the Vague on  Night-People. In late 2010 Wet Hair added third member Matt Fenner to the group on bass and synth. Their third full length album, In Vogue Spirit, came out on De Stijl Records in May 2011. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wet+Hair">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
