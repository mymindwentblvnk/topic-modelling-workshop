Stalinorgel seems to be the name of at least two musicgroups.

One came from Augsburg/Germany and was founded in the mid-80s. There Songs appeared only on tape and later on the Augsburg-sampler "Musik aus einer toten Stadt" (music from a dead city) in 2003. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Stalinorgel">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
