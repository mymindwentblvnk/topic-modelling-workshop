Fed-up with the entire trend flooding the scene, NERVOCHAOS was born on the spring of 96, with the idea of creating an aggressive and chaotic music shredding the barriers of Death Metal and Hard Core. NERVOCHAOS gained cult status in the extreme music scene due to their hard work over the past years, offering a sonic extravaganza in their unique way. Their demo-tapes have become collector’s items in the underground, supporting their regular releases.

Their first, four track demo-tape, “Nervo Chaos” was released in late 96. “Pay Back Time” is the band’s debut full length CD and it was released, by Tumba Records, in early 98. “Disfigured Christ” is the band’s 2nd four track demo-tape and came out in early 2000, by Tumba Records. NERVOCHAOS released in 2002, via Destroyer Records, their 2nd full length CD “Legion of Spirits Infernal”. The 3rd four track demo-tape “Necro Satanic Cult” was released once again by Tumba Records, in 2004. “Quarrel in Hell” is their 3rd album released in Brazil by Tumba Records and in the USA by Ibex Moon Records.

The band manages to deliver the most brutal and yet sophisticated output of their career. The furious Brazilian metallers combine the best elements of all extreme music schools, mixing sheer brutality, amazing technical skills, speed with thrashing vibes and the feeling for their needed virtuosity. Their new album features special guest appearance by Alex Camargo (KRISIUN) on “Horde of Demons”, John McEntee (INCANTATION) on “Cursed Soul”, Emperor Magnus Caligula (DARK FUNERAL) on “Televangelism”, Sanguine & Wrath (AVERSE SEFIRA) on “Evocations” and Mark ‘Barney’ Greenway (NAPALM DEATH) on “Nailed to the Bed of Worms”.

The band is not afraid of performing live or touring, sharing stage with acts such as CANNIBAL CORPSE, KRISIUN, NAPALM DEATH, KREATOR, BIOHAZARD, DISMEMBER, AGNOSTIC FRONT, DISGORGE, DRI, MONSTROSITY, VULCANO, DEEDS OF FLESH, PANDEMIA, TOTAL FUCKIN DESTRUCTION, BELPHEGOR, ICONOCLASM, POSSESSED, SADISTIC INTENT and many more to list. NERVOCHAOS is now on the road promoting their newest release.
