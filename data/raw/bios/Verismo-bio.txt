While throes of indie bands, experimental rock outfits, and techno-infused acts continue to battle it out for recognition in the highly-competitive New York City music scene, a trio of professionally trained musicians in a Brooklyn-based studio churn out thrash metal that has turned heads throughout the area over the last six years, gaining a devoted crowd of fans and earning the respect of music critics representing many of the most prestigious music publications in circulation and web sources in operation. As Tamas Vajda maintains the momentum with thunderous mastery behind the drum kit, Vincent Cruz lays down unique, pulsating rhythms on bass, and Stephan Laboccetta keeps the pulse soaring with both guitar brilliance and captivating vocals, the group Verismo has made a name for itself as one of the most talked about metal music makers at work today.

Verismo’s debut release “City of Kings” took the scene by storm, and their live sets at major music venues throughout the greater New York City area that preceded earned a following of avid music fans that most bands would die for. Now, their highly-anticipated new four track EP “Greed” has Verismo enthusiasts on their toes. What is keeping music lovers even more anxious is the band’s upcoming full-length album, which is expected in Winter 2009. With a melting pot of punk, heavy metal, rock, odd time signatures and dark grooves, Verismo creates intense and highly original work that will surely stand the test of time and maintain the group’s presence on the map for years to come.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Verismo">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
