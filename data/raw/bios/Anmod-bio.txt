Anmod (Brazil) became active in 2005 and was formed by ex-members of Fornication (brutal death metal band from Brazil), Flesh Grinder (goregrind - Brazil) and Hecatomb (brutal death metal - Brazil). The initial line-up was Gerson Watanabe (guitars), Hernan Oliveira (bass/vocals) and Johnny Roberto Rosa (drums).
Anmod's style is a brutal Deathgrind one, sometimes more death, sometimes more grind, but always brutal.
The band's debut album "Monstrosity Per Defectum" was released on 2008 by the label Deity Down Records and its artwork was created by Anderson L.A., who also was responsible for the looks of Fornication's "Unleashed Wrath" (2004) and who already has worked for well known names such as Possessed, Paganizer and Ribspreader.

After some years of inactivity, Gerson Watanabe decided to leave the band and Alex Walter Antunes (guitarist and member of bands like Deformed Slut, Lachrimatory, Eternal Sorrow) joined the band in 2015.
On 2016, the band produced and released their second album "Inner Upheavals" with Gerson Watanabe helping on composition parts. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/ANMOD">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
