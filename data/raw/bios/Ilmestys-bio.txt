Raw black metal featuring Eric King (The Endless Blockade, Slaughter Strike, Column of Heaven, Urine Cop, etc.) and another guy (Chlorine, Spearhead, Who Killed Spanky Jacket, Home Invasion, Love Canal). Sounds a bit like Bone Awl and Slaughter Strike mixed. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ilmestys">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
