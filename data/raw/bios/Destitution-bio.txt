In 2007 Destitution was formed out of the remains of Torched and Xi-Void. The band shared these following interests: beer, pizza and Thrash Metal. The purpose of the band is to have fun and play old-school Thrash Metal and make your beer taste even better!

 The first promo was recorded in 2009 and 2011 marks the year of 'The Human Error', a three-piece concept EP recorded by JÃ¶rg Uken at the Soundlodge Studios in Germany and featuring artwork by the American artist Lee Gaskins. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Destitution">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
