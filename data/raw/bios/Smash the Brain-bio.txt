Originally formed in 1996 as a two-man unit of Shimada (g/vo) and Yamaguchi (vo/ds) in Osaka, Japan, the band had participated several compilations originating in Europe/America, as well as releasing split EPs before releasing the 1st album "Keep Our Way!" in 2000. After adding another guitar player and a bass player, they released the 2nd album "Forever Lasting Twilight" in 2003. With the departure of the original drummer/shouter, they recruited Kamomiya, an ex-member of fellow thrashers GRIM FORCE, and also added the well-respected screamer Shuji, a Japanese answer to Johan Liiva. With the strongest-ever-lineup, they recorded the 3rd "Construction of Despair" album, which will be released in 2006.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Smash+The+Brain">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
