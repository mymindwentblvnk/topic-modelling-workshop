Ssion (pronounced "shun") is a multifaceted creative project spearheaded by Cody Critcheloe, consisting of music, videos, art and live performance. It began as a punk band in Kentucky where Critcheloe is from, spent formative years in Kansas City, where it grew into the New York and Los Angeles based project it is today. Working with a rotating list of collaborators, Ssion has been sporadically releasing records for over 10 years while directing music videos for other notable artists. Ssion has also created artwork for Yeah Yeah Yeahs Fever To Tell and more recently art direction for Charli XCX's Doing It video.
Ssion's 2012 release "Bent" garnered huge amounts of international attention and was accompanied by critically acclaimed music videos for "My Love Grows in The Dark", "Earthquake", "Luvvbazaar", and "High" â€“ all produced and directed by Critcheloe. Critcheloe currently lives in New York City. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ssion">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
