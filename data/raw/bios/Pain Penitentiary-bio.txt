Pain Penitentiary formed in 2004. They spent a year practising and preparing for gigs. Their sound can be described as a raw brutal mix between Death Metal and classic Black Metal.

Initially they started as a four piece with Luvett, Jimi Redshaw, Joe Tong and Darren Von Cohan. However due to conflict of interest Joe and Darren later left. So during a brief period in 2005 Jamie from Mindbleed filled in on bass guitar.

Their first CD was recorded on January the 3rd 2006 at the Brick Makers.
Currently Pain Penitentiary are gigging with bands such as Bloody Embrace, Psychosism, Kill By Numbers and Organ Grinder.

Current lineup:
James Luvett -Vocals & Guitar
Jimi Redshaw -Drums
Sam Voisey-Tong -Bass
