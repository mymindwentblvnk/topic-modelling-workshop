"AVSOLUTIZED. . . was formed in MCMXCVI anno bastardi, and at that time it was a solo, mostly instrumental black metal by MiZANE (All Strings). Ur Èmdr ŒRVN(All Words) joined in some years later.
The guitarist MiZANE has provided quite many materials to other groups around him in his career, and the only official release of AVSOLUTIZED. . . so far, other than “Den Svarta Våndans Genealogi” CD, is “Towards. . . You There” demo in MMVI, that was only spread among labels and related magicians and musicians."
