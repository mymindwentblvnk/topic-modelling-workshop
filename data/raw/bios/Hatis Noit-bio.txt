Hatis Noit (ハチスノイト) is a female vocalist from Shiretoko, Hokkaido, Japan. After studying classical ballet, theater, gagaku (traditional court music), Japanese folk songs and other performing arts, she is now based out of Tokyo. In addition to performing as a solo artist, she is also the vocalist for “funeral classical” Japanese band Mutyumu (夢中夢 (signed to world's end girlfriend’s Virgin Babylon Records).

Solo releases to date include her voice-only debut album “Universal Quiet” (2014), and “Illogical Dance” (2015), a work on which she collaborated with long-time Björk collaborators Matmos. Her unique song-world offers transcendent vocal interpretations that at once deconstruct and recombine the DNA of Western classical, Japanese folk, whispering, and poetry reading, creating a soundscape so astounding that tickets were sold out within just three days of her latest release event at Tokyo’s Lutheran Koishikawa Church.

Highly acclaimed for her versatile collaborations in art, fashion and theater, hatis noit has performed at large-scale art and music events, including Setouchi Triennale 2013, the MOT 20th anniversary event “FLUXUS in JAPAN” (2014), Odate & Kitaakita Arts Festival 2014, the LIQUID ROOM NYE annual countdown “HOUSE OF LIQUIDOMMUNE2015,” and the “Christian Dada S/S 2016 Collection” event.

At the MOT exhibition “Sayoko Yamaguchi: The Wearist, Clothed in the Future,” hatis noit also collaborated with Ukawa Naohiro (DOMMUNE) to create a literal overnight sensation that, once the clip was released, attracted over 80,000 views within the space of a single night. More recent collaborations or co-starring have also seen hatis team up with the likes of Matmos (U.S.), Yagya (Iceland), Keiji Haino (灰野敬二) (Japan), and Tujiko Noriko (Japan). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hatis+Noit">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
