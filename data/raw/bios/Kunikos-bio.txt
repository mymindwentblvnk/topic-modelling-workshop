Kunikos originally started when Kyle Stanfield and his ex Rachel decided to start a melodic death metal band. Lots of people came and went and ultimately the band broke up due to differences between Kyle and the other two founding members (Rachel and her boyfriend).  Kyle then decided to reform the band as a solo project.  One day other members may be found.

The first sounds of this band were for the demo/split album "Kyle Stanfield Showcase Split" and featured a somewhat progressive sound mixed in with melodic death metal.  After this split though the band changed styles drastically, becoming some what of a brutal melodic death metal. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kunikos">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
