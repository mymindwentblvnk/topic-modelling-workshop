There are multiple artists using the name "Solipsist". One of them is described below.

There aren't many words to describe the live show that Solipsist puts on for their fans. Some call it scary, intense, or even terrifying. This is because the guys in Solipsist are out to prove one thing...that real metal is alive and well in NE Ohio. Formed from the remnants of bands Belligerent and Amentia, Solipsist is out to bring the pain back to Cleveland metal.
Noah Buchanan's (ex-AMENTIA) vocals bring a death metal-esque darkness to the already gloomy sounds that Dave Vezdos (ex-AMENTIA), Steve Sinko, Dave Chojnacki (ex-Belligerent), and Mark Witherspoon (ex-Seven Year Dungeon Beard) bring to the table. With their debut EP "Medicate the Masses" released in early 2007, Solipsist has gained noticeable hype throughout the Cleveland music scene.
Solipsist is here to destroy everything you ever knew about metal, and make your ears bleed with satisfaction. SOLIPSIST is here to stay.


"Cleveland-based metal band Solipsist cops a sinister vibe on its debut EP, Medicate the Masses. And even if we can't understand a single word Noah Buchanan growls on songs like "Dead Derelict" and "Paralyze You," the battering rhythms and piercing guitar licks come through loud and clear. The group is made up of guys who used to play in the local bands Belligerent and Amentia. But this tough team-up turns out to be more than just the sum of its parts. There's an authentic crunch to the music that stems from a shared love of all things fast and loud. On its MySpace page, Solipsist filled in the "Sounds Like" tab with "an epic battle between a legion of vikings and a horde of ninjas." We couldn't have put it any better"
