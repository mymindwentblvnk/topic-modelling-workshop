Seducerâ€™s Embrace have started their career in 1998.

The first album "Sinnocence" was released in 2002 through Russian label FONO ltd. and gained good reviews in Russian and Foreign metal press and webzines.

The band has a solid live experience and played lots of shows both in small clubs and in large concert halls around Russian towns. S.E. played together with almost all noticeable Russian bands and also used to support such acts as Nightwish, Dismember and Impaled Nazarene.

Currently the band just finished the recording and mixing of the second album which is called Self-Mythology, is finishing the CD artwork and looking for a label.

Three tracks from the new recording are available for streaming and downloading on band's MySpace page. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Seducer%27s+Embrace">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
