Yuzo Koshiro: 古代祐三 (born December 12, 1967, in Tokyo, Japan) is one of the well-known faces of Japanese video game music. In the 1980s and 1990s, he created the melodies for productions such as the popular Sega: Mega Drive / Genesis titles The Revenge of Shinobi (with his name appearing on the title screen), Bare Knuckle (Streets of Rage) and The Story of Thor, following up with the score for the Super Nintendo game ActRaiser. His latest work includes compositions for the highly acclaimed games Shenmue and Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune 2. Koshiro is also partially responsible for composing the original Ys soundtrack for the popular series of roleplaying games. Unfortunately, Koshiro does not own the rights to any of his famous Ys compositions, and has indicated in interviews that he is bitter about that fact and finds their resulting international acclaim ironic.
