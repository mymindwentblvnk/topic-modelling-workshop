All Girl Summer Fun Band's members include Kathy Foster (drums, bass, vocals), Jen Sbragia (guitar, vocals), New Mexico transplants Kim Baxter (guitar, keyboards, drums, vocals). Ari Douangpanya who played bass and drums and contributed vocals left in late 2004, deciding instead to focus her time on being a full-time mom.

Baxter played in The Young Astronauts, Cherry Ice Cream Smile and One Two; Sbragia with Pretty Face, Kissing Book and The Softies, a duo with Tiger Trap's vocalist Rose Melberg; and Foster with Haelah, Hutch and Kathy, Sub Pop's The Thermals, and one-woman band, Butterfly Transformation Service.

The foursome came into being after a Softies show in Portland, Oregon in 1998, when Baxter approached Sbragia with a tape of her music. She liked what she heard, and Baxter introduced her to a couple of like-minded souls: Foster and Douangpanya. That summer, Baxter asked if they would like to play music together. The answer was an enthusiastic, unequivocal yes. She described the potential results as being that of an "all girl summer fun band" and the name stuck.

After releasing an EP and several singles, they joined K Records. K released two albums for the band, an eponymous debut and the follow-up 2, before Douangpanya left the band in 2005 to raise her son. The remaining members continued as a three-piece. On September 23, 2008, the band released their third full-length album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/All+Girl+Summer+Fun+Band">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
