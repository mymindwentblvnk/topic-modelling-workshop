Glasgowâ€™s Misplaced  are band that blur the line between pop punk and Midwest emo. Singer Kyle Beaton and lead guitarist Kenny Hilling formed the group alongside Richard Smith (bass) from the remnants of a previous project. After recruiting Nicholas Woods (rhythm guitar), the band recorded with Ian Sadler and later released debut single " ffs" under L.A based label We Are Triumphant. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Misplaced">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
