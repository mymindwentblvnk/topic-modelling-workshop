Born in 2002, Sally Sossa learned to rhyme -- and developed a competitive spirit -- during the many family rap battles that permeated her youth.
By age 17, she had uploaded numerous tracks and mixtapes online, transforming from an artist with local support to one with the backing of established names in the industry. Early on, Lil Durk become a key mentor. He almost signed Sossa independently, but eventually she chose a deal with Listen to the Kids, an imprint patronized by the major label Interscope.
In 2020, "Who You Are," the first track released as part of the contract, achieved 500,000 streams within a matter of months. This was swiftly followed by "A Letter to the Streets," "GMFU," and "100 Flows," pieces that all ultimately appeared on December 2020's Life of Sossa. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sally+Sossa">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
