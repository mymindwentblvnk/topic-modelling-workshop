Connecticut, USA (2008 - present)

Formed in 2008 by Michael J. Amari (all instruments and songwriting) in Redding, CT, ThunderWorks is a driven, versatile and charismatic metal band with a unique approach to their melodic blend of thrash, progressive, and death metal. 

Inspired at the age of 14 by James Hetfield, Michael Jonathan Amari began covering Metallica songs on his guitar. Michael grew up hiking in the woods of southwestern Connecticut, taking in the sounds of his favorite metal bands while finding himself awestruck at nature’s beauty. He found that often times returning home from the hikes, he felt a longing to write compositions of his own. He wrote what would become the first ThunderWorks song, the instrumental “Beyond The Seventh Sea” in April 2008, he formed his band ThunderWorks officially in November 2008, from then on he found he could not stop writing and felt very inspired until the first album Thoughts & Thunder was written and arranged by Michael by May 2009.
 
After years of difficulties with finding suitable band members to help him record, Michael settled on recording the entire album himself with the help of a talented vocalist from Belgium. The album was mixed & mastered by J-F Dagenais from Kataklysm and released in 2014!

Influenced by the likes of Metallica, Dream Theater, Opeth and Kataklysm, the band is all about granitic guitar walls, clever song arrangements and an in-your-face vibe.
