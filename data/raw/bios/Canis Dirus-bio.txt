CANIS DIRUS "A Somber Wind from a Distant Shore" debut is a black metal bouquet of Midwestern melancholy forged in the desolate hinterlands of Minnesota. Named after the "dire wolf" indigenous to North America over 100,000 years ago, CANIS DIRUS base their epic songs around their disdain for humanity who have been perpetually encroaching on nature and the natural beauty of our land. The last burning embers of dying autumnal twilight, the beckoning shrieks of oncoming night, the blanket of everlasting darkness: All encapsulated in the foreboding atmosphere of "A Somber Wind from a Distant Shore".

A duo comprising multi-instrumentalist TMP and vocalist RH, CANIS DIRUS' origins are shrouded in mystery and yet most irrelavent as what matters most is The Work. Subtly suggesting their influences of classic Burzum, Shining and Craft, CANIS DIRUS nevertheless process these infuences into a profoundly personal experience wholly reflective of their inner visions. Thus, "A Somber Wind from a Distant Shore" invites introspection and seclusion in equal measures: transcendance of the earthly plane is guarenteed.

"We stand above and against the sick animal, man - the herd animal. Through loathing and indifference our art is an expression of contempt and hatred for the ill-constituted and weak. Our will is our own. We are Canis Dirus."
