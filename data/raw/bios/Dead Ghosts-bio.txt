Dead Ghosts are a four-piece garage rock and/or roll band from Vancouver, British Columbia. Rauchy lo-fi recording style, country-esque vibes, "sweet guitar pluck-and-jangle," driving rhythms, and the occasional Back From The Grave feel is the basic make up of their songs. To get another idea of their sound, they've gotten comparisons to namely the bands the Black Lips and King Khan & BBQ Show. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dead+Ghosts">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
