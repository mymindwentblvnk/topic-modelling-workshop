From Beneath Billows is a Oslo, Norway-based band, founded in Oslo in 2005 by Øyvind Daaland Lesjø, Lars Kristian Jagtøyen, Lars Petter Strand and Lars Sundsbø. Bjørnar Børja later joined to replace Kristian Malterud Moen who left the band in 2006 in pursuit of a different kind of leisure. The founders, with exception of Lars Sundsbø,  started out as a stoner band named The Goon Killing, back in 2003. Lots of songs were written, but without a vocalist and clear vision of what they tried to achieve, the project became stale and got shelved.

From Beneath Billows was born out of a desire to create something grittier and darker, with a richer ambience and more detailed atmosphere. A handful of songs were written in 2005-2006, whereof 4 made it onto the debut album "Evolve". 

The 29th of April 2006 they went into Subsonic Studios to record their first release. Subsonic Studios is helmed by Lars Klokkerhaug. Having worked on releases by Khold, Red Harvest, Enslaved, Jesu and Darkthrone and on the road as Motorpsychos live technician he proved to be the man they were looking for. He knows how to make one feel inspired and focused - despite the occasional börek and coffee sessions. His experience, together with his ability to create calm and relaxing recording sessions, was just what the band was looking for.
