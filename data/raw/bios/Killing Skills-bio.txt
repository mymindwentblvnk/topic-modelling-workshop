RECORDING
With our broad experience in this field, we can offer you the best quality in (vocal) recording. We work with high-end studio-equipment and renowned brands like Neumann, Avalon, Focusrite, RÃ¸de, AKG and RME.
COMPOSITION / PRODUCTION
We operate in a great variety of musical styles with a special focus on hiphop, r&b, pop, house and electronic beats. We also do composition and production for media purposes (tv, radio, internet, game industry).
We often use a lot of analog sources (live instrumentation, analog synths, analog effects) blended with digital, electronic beats to create an unique warm and sparkling sound. We work with classic synths such as the Moog Prodigy, Korg MS-2000 and Roland Juno 60. This collection is complemented by a couple of rare and unique synths like the Polivoks (Russian analog synth), Jen SX 1000 and the Sequential Circuits Pro-one.

When it comes to mixing & mastering, we provide a clear, open and stable sound for each musical genre. We focus on all the details and treat every musical layer with respect to result in a professional, outstanding sound.
Because Killing Skills has a professionally educated engineering background, you will obviously be satisfied and stunned by our mixing & mastering results.
