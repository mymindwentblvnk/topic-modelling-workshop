What Mad Universe is a project created in November 2008 by "RK" in Albi, France.
WMU's music evolves in a Post-Rock / Metal register. 
Influenced by astronomy and mythology, the journey between space and time can begin.
 Welcome to a world where reality alongside the imagination, where emotion melodies confronts high winds. 

A demo and two EP are now available for free download.

 "PEP" WMU joined with the aim of replacing "the battery computer parts, by the sound of his real drums. 

The band released its first album, A Cosmic Chapter With Gaia, in 2010, under Apathia Records.

The goal today is to complete the training to be ready to play on stage in 2010. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/What+Mad+Universe">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
