Based out of South Jersey with the sole purpose of creating neck-breaking metal, Burial Mound is set to release their debut album 'Relics of a New Age'. The record was recorded at Conclave Studios and produced by Corey Pierce of Jersey's own God Forbid. Burial Mound was formed in 2012 and released their first EP 'With Honor' in 2013 and began to make a name for themselves along the east coast. They solidified their lineup a year later and started to establish a more unique and developed sound that is just as vigorous as it is melodic. With a new album on the horizon and a determined mindset, Burial Mound has undeniably become a band worth watching. Burial Mound currently consists of vocalist Mike Germano, guitarists Joe Germano and Nick Ursomarso, Dan Gunning on bass, and Rob Gladden on drums.
