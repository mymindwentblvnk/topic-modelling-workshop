Theater of the Absurd are a progressive rock/metal band from New York City. 

Formed in 2006 by drummer Patrick Curley and guitarist Mike Neumeister, the
 bandâ€™s initial intent was to play unique extreme metal, equal parts progressive and ferocious. The vision of the band, however, expanded greatly in a matter of a few short years; the focus became on delivering songs which were vast in scope and influence, a unique, emotional listening experience. Now with a heightened maturity from years of honing their musical craft, Theater of the Absurd are ready to release their second album, "The Myth of Sisyphus," an opus which features the rich talents of musicians such as Chandler Mogel (Outloud) on vocals, and the expertise of such legendary individuals as Jim Morris of Morrisound Studio (Death, Iced Earth, Trans-Siberian Orchestra, Warrant) handling the mixing duties and Maor Appelbaum (Cynic, Halford, Therion, Amored Saint, Dokken, Sepultura) providing the mastering duties.
