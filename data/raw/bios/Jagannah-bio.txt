Jagannah is a sludge / drone doom metal band from Modena, Italy. The project started taking its shape in April 2006 from the remaining members of MyClit, crossover band with a discreet live activity in Modena local area and tracks on the SUB compilations.

Peter Pitone (drums) and Scott Mary (guitar, vocals) abandon the played roads up to new complex timings and melodies, decomposing the structure of tracks and opening their jams to a wider influences' diameter.
The search for a low frequencies' pusher ended with the arrival of Friederich Katzenjammer, who found in the twisted distorted rabid sludgy and slow sounds of the other two’s the perfect territory where to vent his four strings.

The influences range gets wider, atmospheres are dilated in mazes of complicated fury. Just a few names can remain in the brain of a Jagannah listener: Melvins, psichedelia, stoner doom, noise, Yob.
It took months and months to find a name for the band but the gender they play is still uncertain and they have no will to find it: “Jagannah” feels fine just when outside, “Jagannah” it’s invented without any meaning pretensions, “Jagannah” it’s played without pretensions of fidelity to a style, “Jagannah” it’s screamed without sense pretensions.

In February 2007 enough music was written and everything was recorded for the 40 minutes of “Thedious”, a misterious and (excessive) long demo. Everything was recorded in their small rehearsal room with cheap machineries. Self-produced, self-played, self-composed in Modena, Italy. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jagannah">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
