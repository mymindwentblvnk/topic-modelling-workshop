Comprised of Raisa K, Marc Withasee & Micachu (Mica Levi), the band began in 2009 halfway through the making of Micachu’s debut release ‘Jewellery’ (Rough Trade) which she worked on with Matthew Herbert, resulting in half that album being recorded with The Shapes and half her own electronic solo work. Since then the band have toured extensively in the U.S., Europe & Australia.

Micachu & Raisa remix under the guise ‘M.A.T.H.E.S’ for artists including The XX, Metronomy, Roots Manuva, Konono No.1 and Jamie Liddell. Micachu has also released four mixtapes available for free download: ‘Filthy Friends’, ‘Kwesachu vol.1 w/ Kwes.’, ‘Kwake Bass VS Micachu - Meat Batch’ and ‘Chopped&Screwed’ mixtape, hosted by Brother May which samples from the London Sinfonetta & Micachu & The Shapes ‘Chopped & Screwed’ album.

So, a quick introduction, Björk is said to be a fan of Micachu and can probably identify with another artist brave enough to take pop music into entirely uncharted territory. Micachu is largely inspired by Harry Partch who famously used an array of customized and home made instruments. These included a xylophone made of light bulbs, a ‘Cloud Chamber’ made out of pyrex dishes that could not only be played musically but detect particles of ionizing radiation and a series of highly complicated 44 stringed instruments.

Similarly Micachu uses a modified guitar played with a hammer action called a ‘chu’ and a bowed instrument fashioned from a CD rack. She also uses improvised instruments, such as glass bottles or a vacuum cleaner. They describe their music as pop, but the term may be misleading, as their music veers away from much of pop's defining characteristics, including obvious choruses and accessible lyrics, and often makes use of unconventional playing styles. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Micachu+And+The+Shapes">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
