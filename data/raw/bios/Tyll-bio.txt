"Truly wonderful and extremely little known krautrock released on the Kerston label (same imprint as the Gaa LP) and with something of their widely variable and fascinating approach. With it's seamless fusions of acid rock fury and amiable folksiness, this project of Eulenspygel's drummer (using the first name of the notable German roguish literary character that Eulenspygel would take their name from) has a definite stylistic carry-over from it's parent project, albeit lacking the wildly over-the-top vocals that make Eulenspygel a no-go proposition for some."
