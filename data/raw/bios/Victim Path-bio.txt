Dark way of metal formation VICTIM PATH started in 2009. The lyrics of the team are based on the theme of misanthropy, pain, loneliness of a human being who is deprived of a right to be god's creation. The denial of religious postulates, rules and dogmas of everyday life is the main idea of the hard music of the group.
