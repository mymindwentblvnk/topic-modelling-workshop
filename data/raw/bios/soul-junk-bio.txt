The core of the band is Glen Galaxy (former Trumans Water member, Glen Galloway). Other members include Slo-Ro, Brian Cantrell, Micah Ortega, Ron Easterbrooks, Jon Galaxy and Nathan Poage. Many others are credited per album or track.

The first Soul-Junk release was called ''1950''. Its name was derived from the musical style of the era, a fusion of rock and free jazz. Subsequent albums have been numbered up from 1950; Extended Play releases have been numbered down. Soul-Junk songs have also been released on innumerable compilations.

Early Soul-Junk albums (such as ''1950'') almost exclusively feature low-fi, Indie rock style tracks of Glen singing bible verses interlaced with instrumental noise tracks. As Soul-Junk gained members its sound advanced toward rock and pop. ''1953'' and ''1954'' show signs of this continual change.

''1955'' shows a transition in Soul-Junk's sound. The double-disk set consists of pop / Indie rock / hip hop influenced sounds. It is also the last disk to make extensive use of biblical quotes, though Soul-Junk's lyrics still clearly reflect their Christian worldview.

Later albums are based in experimental, abstract hip-hop. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Soul-Junk">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
