Monika Kruse is one of Berlin's most recognised DJs. Voted 4th Best National DJ in a poll by Germany's leading music magazine, Raveline, she came just behind Sven VÃ¤th. She has achieved great success in the industry for over a decade during which she has turned her hand to many genres and conquered each with a unique slant. Changes of Perception unveils a new side to Monika Kruse, the sound of a musician upping her game.

September 08 sees the release of her debut solo artist album, Changes in Perception that she produced with Gregor Tresher on her own label, Terminal Music. 

Monika's supple sound is admired by many, she was a guest on earlier this year on John Digweed's Transitions radio show, written about in the UK's Guardian Guide and will be profiled in Germany's 'The Face' magazine next month. Here is a female not afraid to take risks and at the forefront of a new movement. Previously she has seen success in deep house in the early nineties and later to the darker side of techno. 

Monika Kruse will start her Changes of Perception Tour in September 2008 beginning at Berlin's massive Panorama Bar / Berghain club. Previously she will be playing at the Berlin Love Parade, Streetparade, Circle of Love festival alongside Richie Hawtin, Luciano, Dubfire, Ricardo Villalobos & Tiefschwarz and Nature One, Germany's biggest outdoor festival as well as dates at Sonar and throughout Europe.
