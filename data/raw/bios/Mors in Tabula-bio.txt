Mors In Tabula was formed in December 2003 by George Julius, wanting to create something new and original, including all forms of extreme music using the eerie atmosphere of a horror movie soundtrack. Heavy guitars, chilling industrial sounds, raw and demonic vocals and of course totally eerie feeling.

After two months he proposed his ex-bandmate from Regent Harry Noctifer to join the band. They soon got at Iambic studio and recorded 10 tracks from which they've chosen 4 tracks to make a promo for the press. The reviews were outstanding and many reviewers said that "This is the sound of things to come".

The bands reputation was growing fast in the circles of the underground scene worldwide, and they were offered proposals to take part in many compilations. They chose to participate in Spent Decibels (USA) comp cd, among other industrial bands, and a compilation made by the producers of Headcase Radio (Seattle USA). All the money of the sales of this comp. cd is offered to organizations that are dedicated to research into curing and care of people afflicted with Multiple Sclerosis.

Mors In Tabulas music got the interest of one of the biggest selling car tuning magazines in Greece, Power Techniques, and used their song "Noctifer" as a soundtrack in their "The Special Collectors" edition vol.1 DVD, and on their TV commercial which was broadcasted on national network by Greek TV channels.

In January 2006 the band signs to Sleaszy Rider records and their debut album "Blemish" is going to be released in 31 of July 2006 and it will be distributed worldwide <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mors+In+Tabula">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
