Drohtnung has been noted for being the first Depressive Suicidal Black Metal band to come out of Western Australia. Originally called GrafƒÅsfolc, Drohtnung begun in 2004 as the solo project of Old (also credited in various bands/projects as Gamol, Thrydwulf and/or Gaap). Drohtnung existed as a live entity between 2013 -2015, before returning to a solo recording project. Since 2006, Drohtnung has released 2 albums, 4 demos and 2 split releases (with Woods of Desolation and Broken Spirit). Other projects of Old include The Ninth Departure, Mors de Corpus, Old Burial Temple and Pestis Cultus (ex-Snorri), with guest appearances on releases with Drowning The Light, Broken Spirit, Yhdarl,  Forest Mysticism and Woods Of Desolation. Old also previously played session bass (live) with Pestilential Shadows and was the original vocalist of Wardaemonic. Drohtnung coined the genre Depressive Black Noise as a revolt against the trending fashion of DSBM.
