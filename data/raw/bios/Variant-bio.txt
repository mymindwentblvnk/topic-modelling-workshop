Variant refers to multiple artists:

1) USA-based electronic music producer and Echospace [Detroit] record label head honcho, Stephen Hitchell, uses the Variant moniker to release his more long-form ambient dub and ambient techno recordings. Variant's albums invoke various celestial phenomena ranging from comets, to stars, to the aurora borealis. The cosmic preoccupation plays out in the music too, which ranges from warm analog space ambient infused with field recordings to more rhythmically active synthesizer loops and drones. Indeed, Variant's recordings are frequently intended to "score the constellation of mystical events occurring in the depths of space." Later works concern themselves with dream states and oneirology. 

2) Variant is a metalcore band from Florida, consisting of Devin Ingelido, formerly the bassist of emo-pop act VersaEmerge, Javi Melo of JMelo Recordings, and drummer Wyatt Wood. With a stream of steady singles, each evolving from the previous one, Variant is a force to be reckoned with in the world of modern metal, with a combination of technical but catchy riffs and poignant song-writing. They have recently released A Much Needed Death. featuring Courtney LaPlante of Spiritbox <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Variant">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
