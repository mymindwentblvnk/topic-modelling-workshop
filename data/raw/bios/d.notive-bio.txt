d.notive (real name Matt Larson) is an electronic music producer from Minneapolis, Minnesota.

d.notive has been at the forefront innovative sound design for well over a decade. Entranced by the lush and dynamic soundscapes of the 1980's, his aesthetic borrows heavily from the cinematic imagery of Neo-noir, classic alternative music, and of course synthpop.

Leveraging a rich, illustrious backdrop of classic synthesizers, his work includes countless pop songs and dance tracks, video game soundtracks, cartoon fan music, and film scores, drawing comparisons to artists like Depeche Mode, New Order, and Duran Duran.

His critically acclaimed album Sentinel has enjoyed consistent rotation thanks to synthwave outlets like NewRetroWave, with the first single "Red Light Syndrome" debuting at the #7 spot on their weekly charts. He has also been a regular collaborator with FiXT records, appearing alongside artists Cassetter, Fury Weekend, and Scandroid. Additionally, he maintains a close relationship with Funky Way Records (the official label of Funky Panda,) and Laserdiscs Records as a noted contributor to the original soundtrack for UK-based independent film "The Summoner."

His signature vocal style even earned him a leading role in a short animation by Hazbin Hotel and Helluva Boss animator Vivienne "Vivziepop" Medrano. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/d.notive">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
