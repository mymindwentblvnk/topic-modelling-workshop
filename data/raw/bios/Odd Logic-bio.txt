Odd Logic was formed in 2003 after Sean Thompson's local Seattle touring band MINE! disbanded in 2002. MINE! had one independent album “Powerlines”. They toured WA which included some opening stage gigs for Sting, Journey, and John Waite. Odd Logic was formed as an outlet for Sean's true passion of more progressive, hard-edged rock. The demo “Parallax Panorama (2004)” featured a guest percussionist and bassist who are in reality Sean's alter egos. Sean Thompson played and recorded all instruments and vocals. Later releases include Legends Of Monta: Part I (2006), Part II (2009), the Sync-To-Movie adventure Over The Underworld (2011), and the fantasy live record featuring a full production of cast members and brand new music called If We Were Live (2013). Recent albums have included guest appearances from local NW musicians including Kevin Hunter who contributed all keyboard & piano on If We Were Live.

A full group version of the band has formed in preparation for live shows and a brand new album. They are listed in the "members" section.
