There are several Sungods out there:

1. Rhythms, vibrations, star clusters of noise and dark energy drones. 2008 in Austin, TX sees the use of soundrugs and space travel by two wandering souls of the universal void. Materializing from the mental energy field of sunship Odhinn (who's maiden voyage was preserved in cassette form in a Next Level dimension) and riffining the unconscious flow of celestial free sound, souls Mike and Braden converse through the exchange of six string electro-dynamics and hammering of the metafabric. Parallel explorations of Eastern spiritual waves and kosmische organ synthesis soaring on psychedelic fuel in search of the inner vision.

2. SunGod is a project by Marcus Giltjes (Girls Under Glass; Pink Turns Blue), Rodney Orpheus (Cassandra Complex) and Patricia Nigiani [ex Project Pitchfork; Aurora(Sutra)]. It deals with the culture and religion of the carribean Voodoo (Vodou) f.e. the initial track of their first CD SunGod is called Legba who is the sun god.
