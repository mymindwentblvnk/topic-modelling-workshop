There are two different bands with the name *Keziah*: 1)The younger sister of hip-hop artist Hezekiah ; 2) The Sludge/Post Metal/Doom metal band from the Basque Country

1) Keziah is the younger sister of hip-hop artist Hezekiah and it runs in the family. You will find her on all of Hezekiah's projects and now she is taking a leap out on her own venture. And just in time to fill the void of seasoned female MC's. She has released her new self-titled EP.

2) Looking for dense dark and heavy music, full of ambient  details, Keziah is born,  a Sludge/Post-Metal band from the Basque country formed in 2015 with  members: Gorka (former Akhvan guitars), Aitor (former Akhvan / Desert  Tracks bass) and  Jonan (Melmak vocals & guitars). Then Alvaro (former Chivo / Cheel  ghar drums) join drums in early 2016.  Keziah sound is influenced by different bands like Black  Sabbath/Neurosis /Crowbar/Amenra/Breach/Cult of Luna/Entombed/Horn of the Rhino and so  on.
On August 2017 is released the  first E.P. titled "The Ocean is not Silent", recorded at Grabasonic  Studios at the basque country, and mixed at Redmont Studios in Sweden,  by the great Magnus Lindberg (Producer and also Cult of Luna drummer).  The E.P. is then phisically co-edited by Cosmic Tentacles, Muerte Matar  Records, Barraks Promotions and Violence in the Veins Records
