There are a number of bands with the name Alliance. 

1. The AOR/Melodic Rock supergroup Alliance formed in 1997 features Robert Berry ( Guitarist, Vocalist & Producer - Robert Berry, Hush, 3 ), David Lauser ( Drummer - Sammy Hagar, Sammy Hagar And The Waboritas, Justice Brothers ), Gary Pihl ( Guitarist - Sammy Hagar, Boston ), & Alan Fitzgerald ( Bassist & Keyboardist - Night Ranger, Sammy Hagar ).

2. The rock/postrock band Alliance has existed in different constellations since late 2003 and with the current lineup since january 2005. When david and viktor joined the band they found the sound that the band had always looked for. Erik moved back to karlstad for the summer and the band started to write new material inspired by the hardcorestylings of contemporary swedish hardcorebands, but keeping a sort of minimalistic approach to the songs. Now the band sets out to do as many gigs as possible throughout sweden and spread the sound of alliance.

3. An American hip hop group from Brooklyn, NY, the Alliance released their debut album "We Could Get Used To This" on First Priority Music in 1988. The line-up includes The King of Chill (producer/lyricist), DJ Skill (producer/cuts) and K-Swift (producer/lyricist). They're also known as The Alliance of Emcees and/or Brooklyn Alliance. Their first release issued in 1985 as 'The King Of Chill & The Alliance of Emcees', with the single 'The Beast Within'. Other production credits for King of Chill are: Barsha, Audio Two, MC Lyte, Kings of Swing, and MC Peaches. 

4. A hardcore/metal band from Colorado who recorded at least 2 albums since 2001 (Alliance (Self Titled), & Promo EP).  The last I heard, they were relocating to Los Angeles (2003).
