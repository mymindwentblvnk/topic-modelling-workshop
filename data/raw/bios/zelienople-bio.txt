Zelienople is an American psychedelic drone band formed in Chicago, Il in 1998 out of the ashes of several failed rock bands. Keyboardist / clarinetist Brian Harding, bassist / synth player Matt Christensen, and drummer Mike Weis came together out of a similar dislike for their previous experiences and a love for drone-based jazz. 

Combining their many strange and psychedelic influences into a lean sound, the group gigged around Chicago until a chance to record for Loose Thread gave them the chance to release Pajama Avenue, their debut, in the spring of 2002. A series of albums followed. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Zelienople">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
