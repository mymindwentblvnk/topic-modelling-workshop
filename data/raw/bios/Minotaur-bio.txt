There are 4 bands called MINOTAUR:

1) MINOTAUR was formed in the summer of 1983 by 3 young musicians from Hamburg / Germany. The band decided to play really fast and aggressive thrash metal like bands Slayer, Dark Angel, Possessed and so on. After a couple of line-up changes MINOTAUR entered the studio in 1986 to record their first Demo "The Oath of Blood" which got pretty good reviews among european metal critics and fans alike  and was also voted the 7th best demo of 1986 by the German "Rock Hard" fanzine.

MINOTAUR became more professional and they were asked to record a song for the "Teutonic Invasion Part I" sampler which was released by Roadrunner Records. After getting good reviews again, MINOTAUR decided to release a self financed and produced full-length album in 1988. This LP was limited to 2.500 copies. The whole pressing was sold in a few months (album was re-released on CD in the 90's).

Encouraged by the success of the shows MINOTAUR decided to record a few new songs. Soon they got in touch with the Hamburg independent label "Remedy Records" and a new 7" inch single was released in October 1990 with the two tracks "Towards My Eternity" and a classic "Total Decay".

This was followed by very successfully gigs and tours with other bands like Torment, Drifter (CH), Melissa, Procyon, Helstar, Hades, Viper (Ger), Rage, Invocator, Vendetta,Onkel Tom, Samael, Sabbat (UK), Betrayer (Ger), Gorefest, Risk, Riff Raff, Holy Moses and so on.

The band has reformed recently and released a new album "God May Show You Mercy...We Will Not" through the "I Hate Records". The album received generally positive reviews.
