ELIS NOA from Vienna push the boundaries of electronic pop. Their musical framework ranges from pop to contemporary R&B, all the way to future soul. With their second single release “Still Nothing (Goddamn)” ELIS NOA (Elisa Godino and Aaron Hader) once again create a distinct sound woven together by Godino’s extraordinary voice — relinquishing pop music from it’s conventional structures without losing it’s accessibility. ELIS NOA’s songs give a sense of longevity while still moving with the frontiers of contemporary pop. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Elis+Noa">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
