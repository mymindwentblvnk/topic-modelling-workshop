The Parallax Corporation consists of I-F and his partner Intergalactic Gary. And even though I-f and The Parallax Corporation were called "one of the 10 essential players of Electroclash" by the english NME, this is completly different from other Electro Pop. The Parallax Corporation is discribed as "brutal italo disco" and "noir". The movie "The Parallax View" (R: Alan J. Pakula, 1974) served The Parallax Corporation as visual pattern for their album C.O.C.A.D.I.S.C.O. The affinity for the metaphorical story of the film is getting together with I-f's humoristic pessimism and his scepticism about media, fashion and politics. For this reason the exception artist decided early to work in independent networks. The sound of the two last Disko B releases "Fucking Consumer" and "Man from P.A.C.K" sited somewhere between Techno, Acid melodies, analogue synthesizer soundscapes and electro has been expanded by the component "COCADISCO": a mixture that quotes (Italo) Disco and Funk in a bastardy way and is gorgeously put in scene by the Soul of Nancy Fortune's, Fred Ventura's and Mr. Melvin White's vocals. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Parallax+Corporation">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
