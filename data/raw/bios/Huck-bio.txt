Paul Dagnello and Roger Lavallee both speak the language of people who are obsessed with music and the gear used to make it.  I try to listen and learn, but their references are often so esoteric that it's obvious that I'm only pretending to know what they're talking about.  My contributions are little more than echolalic gibberish, and I usually have to wait until they return to speaking English before I can really join the conversation.
 
Paul also showed us his talent for songwriting when he took a song that Scott had written that wasn't working out very well at all and turned it into one of the better songs on the album.  If the song Scott wrote was an article of clothing, it would be a pair of footy pajamas with three legs and a three-button poo-hatch in the back.  Scott discarded it, Paul fished it out of the trash, and with some alteration, a nip here, a tuck there, and a few sequins, voila:
 
Hammer pants!
 
It's not quite like making a silk purse out of a sow's ear, but he did manage to make the musical equivalent Hammer pants out of footy pajamas, which was a pretty impressive thing to witness.  We're all very excited about the song now, and when Roger finishes mixing it I think it will be another pop gem from Huck.
 
Scott is digging the Hammer pants.  He's dancing from side to side around the studio, his fists on his hips, shouting "Don't touch me!"  Paul corrected him a couple of times, saying "It's can't touch this," but Scott won't listen.
 
Wait until he realizes that Paul sewed the poo-hatch shut.
