Formerly called Prime Evil and PrimeEvil. They took the name from the celebrated Venom album of the same name that Jeff "Mantas" Dunn and Tony Dolan played on. They changed their name to "M-Pire of Evil" after another band in the United Kingdom was discovered having the same name.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/M-Pire+of+Evil">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
