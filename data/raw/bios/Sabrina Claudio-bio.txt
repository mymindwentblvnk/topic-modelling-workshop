Sabrina Claudio is an R&B-rooted singer/songwriter who favors ballads that are low-key and aching in nature. As a youngster, she first soaked up the dance music she heard in her native  Miami, Florida  and was eventually drawn to pop-oriented contemporary R&B like Mariah Carey and Destiny's Child. Her 1st major steps as a recording artist were made in  2016, when she appeared on the songs by Duckwrth and The Classmatez, and uploading a 7-track EP called "Confidently Lost". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sabrina+Claudio">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
