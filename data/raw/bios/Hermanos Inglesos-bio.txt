Hermanos Inglesos are real life brothers Cedric and Didier Engels, resident DJs at the infamous Culture Club in Ghent (Soulwax, The Glimmers) and winner of the 2004 Belgian edition of Diesel-U-Music Awards.

They mixed and compiled the five years CultureClub-Compilation and the Culture Club Volume 6 compilation. In 2008 they remixed Plastic Operator's 'Home 0207'. The two-part remix was so hot that it charted on DJ charts and played on radio even before any promos were sent out. 

Hermanos Inglesos are now signed to Fine Day Records and are releasing their first single Komodo. The release comes  with remixes provided by French producer The Toxic Avenger, label mates Plastic Operator and German producers Acidkids.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hermanos+Inglesos">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
