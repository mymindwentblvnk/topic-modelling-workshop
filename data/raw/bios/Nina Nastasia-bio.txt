Nina Nastasia is a New York City-based singer-songwriter born in Hollywood, California. Her music is noted for an eclectic mix of folk delicacy and intricate chamber music arrangements worked out with her band and partner Kennan Gudjonsson.

Nastasia has released six albums so far, the first of which, Dogs, was initially released in 2000 in a miniscule edition of 1000 copies on Socialist Records. The album sold out quickly and her subsequent albums,  The Blackened Air (2001) and  Run to Ruin (2003) were released on indie label Touch and Go Records. The label also re-released Dogs in 2004. All three albums were recorded by Steve Albini, as were later albums released on Fat Cat Records. These include On Leaving in 2006 and You Follow Me (produced in collaboration with Jim White) in 2007. Her sixth and most recent album, Outlaster, was also recorded by Steve Albini and was released in June 2010, preceded by the single Cry, Cry, Baby in May.

Nastasia was a favorite of late BBC disc jockey John Peel and recorded six sessions for his shows. The last one was recorded with the help of Tuvan throat singing group Huun-Huur-Tu. Nastasia also contributed a song to the tribute compilation for Peel named "Bird of Cuzco". Two of Nastasia's songs made Peel's annual Festive Fifty: "Ugly Face" (ranked 4th in 2002) and "You, Her & Me" (13th in 2003).
