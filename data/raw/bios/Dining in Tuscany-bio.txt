Dining In Tuscany formed in late 2005 and after an extensive writing period hit the studio to create a sonic representation of the bands intentions. A no nonsense approach to recording and an appreciation of frostbitten atmospherics as dictated by their contemporaries, laid way for the creation of the "post cards from coco lezzone". The EP is cacophonous and raw, it's production values lend themselves to that of old school "necro" black metal and would not disappoint fans of both modern heavy music and their forefathers. From its dark ethereal sound to it's rustic artwork, this self funded and self produced release has been met with rousing response in 2007

2011 - 1556

Dining In Tuscany are merchants of the noise image. Their 5 piece sound is a tapestry of light and dark, slow spun and tightly woven. Blasts are knitted with delicate melodies and cavernous howls, a product of eclectic tastes. Intense and intricate, Dining in Tuscany is an acquired taste for the distinguished palette.

Dining In Tuscany’s first full length ‘1556’ is a sonic portrait of Rene Magritte’s Empire of Light. Its 6 tracks blend day and night ‘Postcards from Coco Lezzone’ was the starter, ‘1556’ is the main course. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dining+In+Tuscany">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
