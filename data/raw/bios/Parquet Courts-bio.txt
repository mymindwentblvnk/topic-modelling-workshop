Parquet Courts is a band from New York City.  The band is fronted by Andrew Savage, who is known for his collaborations with projects like Fergus & Geronimo, Teenage Cool Kids and Wiccans. Savage is joined by  Austin Brown (Guitar), Sean Yeaton (Bass) and Max Savage (Drums). 

The bands’ debut release is described as The Fall meets Neil Young- which all makes sense on the band’s debut release, “American Specialties”. The quartet wanders through the American and British underground, picking away their favorite parts with confidence. The lyrics, when intelligible, are bizarre and dramatic. “She looked at me like a fry pan reducing,” moans Savage, from the same lustful subconscious built by the darker moments of psychedelia. Then at times, such as on the 70’s folkish “Square States”, thoughts are more sentimental and transparent. The setting for “American Specialties” ranges from a crusty Brooklyn bodega, to an endless Texas desert. If these sorts of soundscapes appeal to your mind, then you're sure to stumble upon Parquet Courts sooner or later. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Parquet+Courts">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
