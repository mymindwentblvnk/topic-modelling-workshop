Italians Andrea Dulbecco and Luca Gusella form the eclectic marimba and vibraphone duo known as Aisha Duo (meaning "life" in Arabic). The duo project features a distinctive and intimate sound. Their debut album "Quiet Songs" (OS 502) features a transcription of eight of the "Children Songs" by Chick Corea, a selection of their own works, and other compositions. The project was recorded in a 17th Century Church in Italy and features frame drums master Glen Velez and extraordinary Italian cellist Marco Decimo.

The music of Aisha Duo is inspired by a diverse array of artists including David Friedman, and the Gary Burton/Chick Corea duo.
