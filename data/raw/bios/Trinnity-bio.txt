Gothic-metal-all-female-band Trinnity started its activities in March 2002, when some girls decided to join forces and shape their influences into music of their own. The bands they listened to included The 3rd and The Mortal, Sisters of Mercy, Lacuna Coil, Paradise Lost, among many others. Trinnity split up in the beginning of 2007.
