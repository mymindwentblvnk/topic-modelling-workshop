Marga’s music history starts from the very young age of 5, after she received, what she called “the greatest present in the world – The little Yamaha synthesizer”. At 13, she began taking private music lessons for piano. Marga soon discovered that her main interest was the technology of making music, so she started investing in her own music studio and in gathering as much knowledge as she could about composition and production. She received a diploma in music production, mastering engineering and recording from “Enterprise”, one of the biggest music studios in Macedonia. Over the next two years she became the assistant to Valentino Skenderovski – the owner of the “Enterprise” music school and studio. There she worked on many different projects: composing, arranging, recording and mixing music for singers, bands, commercials and as well as music for television. Marga Sol now has her own studio, where everyday her music ideas and feelings create something that she calls “Marga Sol’s Music”! Her unique sound, her unique production, recognizable, but variable..Anyhow, deeply sincere and emotional!

Marga Sol is performing (and producing) except as Lounge DJ, also as HOUSE DJ, in the country and abroad, through CLUBS & Coffee BARS…Marga presents her unique house (tech/deep/vocal/latin…) sets, life performances in front of more than 10 000 people, creating high voltage atmosphere, performing with high level of love energy toward the crowd and music she plays… <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Marga+Sol">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
