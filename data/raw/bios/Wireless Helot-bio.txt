A death metal/grindcore band from Florian√≥polis, Santa Catarina, as a sarcastic, short-lived project created by Cristiano Passos and Helder Martinovsky (members of Necrobutcher) to protest against the narrow-mindedness of the metal scene at the time. Their only release was the "Helot... of Yourself" demo-tape, in 1990 (recorded November 3rd that year), which is also available in the 3-way split with Madre Coca & Paresthesic Neurodeformities. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wireless+Helot">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
