Nosferion formed in 2001 as a side project for members of Neuro Axis and Vex, both of San Angelo Texas. A Burning Lifeless Eternity (Demo 2002) was recorded in May of 2002. Shortly after the demo was recorded Asphyxus was no longer able to serve as an active member of the band and Odin left due to college. Synox and Astriloth being the only remaining members put the project on ice for the next 5 years. In early 2007 Lord Pryx was recruited on drums followed by Lord Set during the Summer. The first Nosferion practice session in over 5 years was held in July '07, in preparation for live performances in the fall, as well as a possible full length album. Following many shows and an EP, in 2012 Nosferion are planning to release their first LP. TBA
