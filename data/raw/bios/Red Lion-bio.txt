Red Lion, aka Redda Fella, is a ragga mc, song writer, producer and sound engineer based in Melbourne. Red Lion's hard-hitting melodies and socially conscience lyrics reveals a talent with a style truly his own. 
Raised in Cape Town, South Africa, in 1995 he co-founded the band Lions of Zion and released "Iternal Fire" before going solo and recorded "Rise Up", "Lock Down" & "Black Repatriation" with African Dope Records. Trained as a sound engineer, he has produced and collaborated with artists such as JJ, Crosby, Ginga Cobra, Silver Shaka, Koriandah and Melbourne's own Dizzy Dee. In 2005, he had the opportunity to perform at the Africa Festival in Germany, alongside artists such as Gentleman & Queen Omega.
After featuring on several compilations with African Dope Records and performing with artists such as Teba, JJ, Black Dillinger, Zoro, Crosby, Chronic Clan & Jesse Dan, he is preparing to start a new chapter. Drawing inspiration from dancehall, R 'n B and hip-hop genres, he's currently  recording his debut full length album, Red-volution, which will be released under his own record label, Redda Fella Productions. Also on the cards, collaborations with artists Aslan, Dizzy Dee, Zoro and Damajah.
