Thick Pigeon was essentially a vehicle for songwriter Stanton Miranda and arranger Carter Burwell. Based in New York, the duo recorded a brace of oblique, minimalist singles for Crepuscule in 1981-82 before moving sideways to Factory for their first album.

Recorded in Manchester in late 1983, Too Crazy Cowboys saw the duo initially joined by Steven Morris and Gillian Gilbert of New Order, as well as Gillian's sister Kim. In true Factory fashion the album was released a year late. 

Housed in a cover designed by noted American artist Lawrence Weiner, Too Crazy Cowboys was released both by Factory (Fact 85) and Factory US (Factus 16) in September 1984. It proved to be the last Thick Pigeon record released under that moniker, as Carter Burwell then elected to concentrate on film scores.

Stanton Miranda went on to act in movies and off-broadway and to contribute songs for Joy Division tribute album, A Means To An End. Carter Burwell has scored approximately 50 major motion pictures, including Gods and Monsters, Adaptation, Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Being John Malkovich, as well as almost every feature made by Joel and Ethan Coen. On his soundtrack for Psycho III, Stanton Miranda was a featured singer.
