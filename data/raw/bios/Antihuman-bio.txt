I took off in 1982, I always liked things which were strange, which beauty seemed to be quite controversial for many people - hype of kettle, sound of rushing train, control signal after end of a TV programme, statics and feedbacks when trying to catch a radio channel on the LW strip. Despite the fascination of classical music (from Wagner and techno to metal) my "artistic start" went in the direction of antimusic (music/sounds breaking away from standards like rhytm, harmony or melody). Nowadays, I satisfy my thirst of creation by making techno music; riding sinusoids and saws with my beloved 8-bit effect; I riot with digital grindcore and of course I experiment as much as I can. However, I am sure about one thing - I have nothing and I will never have anything to do with showbusiness.
