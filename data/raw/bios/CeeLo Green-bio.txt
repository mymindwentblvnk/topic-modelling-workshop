Thomas DeCarlo Callaway (born May 30, 1975), best known as Cee-Lo Green (sometimes rendered as Cee Lo Green), is an American singer-songwriter, rapper, record producer, actor and talent show TV series judge. CeeLo came to initial prominence as a member of the southern hip hop group Goodie Mob, and as part of the soul duo Gnarls Barkley with Danger Mouse. Subsequently he embarked on a solo career, partially spurred by YouTube popularity. His work has earned numerous awards and accolades, including five Grammy Awards.

Internationally, Green is best known for his soul work: his most popular was Gnarls Barkley's 2006 worldwide hit "Crazy", which reached number one in various singles charts worldwide, including the UK. In the United States, "Crazy" reached number two on the Billboard Hot 100. Its parent album St. Elsewhere, was also a hit, reaching number one on the UK Albums Chart and number four on the US Billboard 200 albums chart. Gnarls Barkley's second album, The Odd Couple (2008), charted at number 12 on the Billboard 200.

In 2010, Green took a break from working with Gnarls Barkley and released the single "Fuck You!" on August 19 as a solo artist. The song was a hit, with the radio-edit version "Forget You" reaching the top spot in the UK and the Netherlands and charting at number two on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. Its parent album, The Lady Killer (2010), saw similar success, peaking within the top five of the UK Albums Chart and debuting within the top 10 on the Billboard 200 albums chart, and receiving a Gold certification from the BPI in the UK. His next two single, "It's OK" and "Bright Lights Bigger City" were also hits in Europe. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/CeeLo+Green">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
