Wälder-Core from Vorarlberg / Austria.


Spring 2010: Five guys and one dream: creating a band, producing own songs, making music where you can´t stand still, touching people and having fun within all. The result after a year: the dream got wings and is flying steeply up.

At the 6th of June 2011 no.sar was playing their first gig which was also their presentation of the debut album in a crowed ambience. With almost 300 CDs given away there is no more description needed if the night was successful.
The feedback of the media and the surprised fans didn´t take long and was accordingly positive and for no.sar motivation pure.

They were continuing in the same tonality: at the second performance no.sar was showing already their music video for the song “envy”, at Christmas they were surprising with four acoustic songs and were proofing with them that they are also able to be contemplate, in may 2012 they presented their second album and played in august next to “Heaven Shall Burn” at the Szene Openair in Lustenau.

The name no.sar comes from the dialect of the region where they´re coming from (Bregenzerwald) and the meaning is someone, somewhere and something. The sound of them is classified between Metal-Core and Melodic-Death. However no.sar is calling their style Wälder-Core, because they´re making no bones about where they´re coming from – even though many people are calling the Bregenzerwald as a anywhere in nowhere. no.sar are even singing some of their songs in their dialect or making their videos literally between browsing cows.
