There is more than one artist with the name 'No Respect':

1)No Respect was a german skapunk-band with mostly political lyrics. The main topics are antifascism, anarchy and freedom.

2)Some nasty and ripping metal that smacks of the bad boy L.A. scene of old, conjuring images of GNR, L.A. Guns, and early Skid Row, as well as some of the early carefree work of both Saigon Kick and Ugly Kid Joe.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/No+Respect">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
