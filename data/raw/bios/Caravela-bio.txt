Caravela is an indie rock band currently residing in Westchester and Brooklyn, NY. The band consists of brothers Frank and Stephen Graniero, both of whom share instrumentation duties. They released an EP entitled "Belvedere" in 2010 and a full length named "Coat of Arms" in the winter of 2011. They are now writing for the next record, playing shows around the northeast, and perfecting the art of drinking and dancing at the same time. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Caravela">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
