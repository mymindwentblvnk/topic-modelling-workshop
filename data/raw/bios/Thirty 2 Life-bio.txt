Since forming in early 2003 Thirty 2 Life have been blending melody and metal, with the intent of putting their own unique stamp on the genre. The band has survived things that would tear most bands apart, a battle with cancer for one member and the unexpected death of another founding member. But through it all Thirty 2 Life has survived and continues to create music that has gained them fans around the world. 
After recording several E.P.'s Thirty 2 Life released the cd "Powered By Pain" in 2006 on their own label Gutter Grunge Records. The second Thirty 2 Life cd "Got One In The Chamber" was released in 2009 also on Gutter Grunge Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Thirty+2+Life">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
