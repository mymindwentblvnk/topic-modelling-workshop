During their recording period they released only two demos under their name; the first, called Tumultuous Travelings, was released in 1992, and the second, called Panaramic Twilight, was released in 1994. Both demos have been remastered and released as 1992-1994 Discography on Dark Descent Records. It was also given a (now sold out) vinyl pressing featuring some of the same bonus material.
