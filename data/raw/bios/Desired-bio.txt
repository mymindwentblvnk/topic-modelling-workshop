Desired is a "sailor senshi" producer from Yekaterinburg, Russia. He was heavily inspired by Japanese music culture, the French House movement, and 90s anime such as Sailor Moon. He is a member of Sailor Team with artists such as Macross 82-99, Night Tempo, Nanidato, android52, and VANTAGE.

Desired usually creates future funk, French house, and vaporwave music but also creates lo-fi hip hop music under the Saturn Genesis alias.
