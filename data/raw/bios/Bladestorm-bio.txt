BladestorM  is a London based Hardcore/Metal band that combine a variety of styles from old-school Hardcore to modern brutal Death Metal influenced by the many different tastes of the members of the band they deliver the kind of metal that they believe to be pure and heavy! The band came into existence in the autumn of 2006 founded by current member Tom"Labadz" Labedzki (drums) and former member Mark ‘maro’ Nieweglowski (guitars) Who would go on to expand the line up to include Kamil "Mocet"Terczynski (vocals) and David O'sullivan (bass&vocals) Which completed the band for the recording of their 2008 debut e.p Obliteration. Shortly after the recording of their e.p and some extensive gigging the band enlisted the services of 2nd guitarist Wojtek "Voytas" Lotz. Then in the summer of 2008 the band parted ways with guitarist Maro and finaly completed their line up. Currently working on new material BladestorM are bringing the Obliteration to venues in and around London.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bladestorm">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
