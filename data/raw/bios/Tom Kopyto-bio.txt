Young seven string guitar virtuoso Tom Kopyto released his 1st solo instrumental CD in 1999. Tom is the next generation of guitar greats with influences ranging from Dream Theater to Pantera and Fear Factory. He can play very "outside" and has great technique. His legato playing is excellent and he is really fast and fluid when he is using the "alternate picking technique" on the guitar. Tom is an excellent rhythm guitarist and the heavy seven string rhythms are an important part of his compositional style and sound. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tom+Kopyto">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
