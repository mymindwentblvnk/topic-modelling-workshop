Deathbeds is a five-piece band from Philadelphia, PA. One part Entombed, one part Integrity, they combine sludge-fueled metal and riff-oriented hardcore in a way that's appalling, yet reassuring. Taking cues from doom and sludge but lacing it with the sensibility of the most visceral hardcore they know that to be the man youâ€™ve gotta beat the man.

Their newest 7inch,  'No Funeral' is out now courtesy of Young Lungs Ltd.
