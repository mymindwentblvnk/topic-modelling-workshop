Melankoli is a depressive metal one-man band from Moscow, Russia, formed in 2009.
They combine the sound of atmospheric black metal and ambient music with a special focus on keyboards to create huge, wintery and depressive soundscapes. Melankoli's style can best be compared to the works of ColdWorld, Lustre, and Death Aura. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Melankoli">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
