THERE IS MORE THAN ONE ARTIST USING THIS NAME

1) Burning Black - heavy metal from northern Italy

In a musical scene where contaminations and compromises follow the current trends, the “Burning Black” have chosen their path without any hesitation. An eighties-style Heavy Metal, as pure as possible, showing that it is still possible to play good music following in the footsteps of great musicians from the past: not imitating them, but looking at the future with the sound of the present. Formed in 2004 by Giovanni Moretto (guitar) and Massimo De Nardi (vocals) with the aim of playing a classic and straight Heavy Metal, the “Burning Black” recorded the promo CDs “Smell the Fire” in 2005 and “Fight to Dream” in 2006 obtaining outstanding reviews from the mainstream and underground press all over Italy and Europe. After fixing the line-up, with Alessandro Jacobi (bass), Marco Maffeis (guitar) and Luca Scomparin (drums), the band began touring with many important Italian and European bands such as Primal Fear, UDO, White Skull, Fire Trails, Bonfire, Soul Doctor, Pink Cream 69, Rage and others without an album to their name out and with no label or promoter support. Between July and August 2007, the band recorded its first full length album entitled “Prisoners Of Steel”, at the Remaster Studios in Vicenza, produced by Tony Fontò (White Skull) and Nick Savio (Hollow Haze), the latter also appearing as a special guest on the album. This album is a perfect representation of how the band has evolved from its formation in 2004 up to the present day, with great attention to sounds and arrangements, but never overlooking the elements that have distinguished its character from the outset: a total and faithful commitment to the rules of uncompromising Heavy Metal, from the 80s NWOBHM to the modern German scene, with American and European Hard Rock influences. The “Burning Black” have never drawn their inspiration from one particularband. They have always preferred to bring together in one sound the best that classic Heavy Metal has produced in the last 30 years. The result is a powerful and compact album, well-produced and with no frills, whose tunes are connected by a passion for music and life on the road!
