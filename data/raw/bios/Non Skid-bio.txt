Non Skid were a punk band from Latvia. They've recorded an album entitled "Ceļš, Kuru Ejam" (The Path We're On). Songs were both in English and Latvian, topics ranging from anti-racism and media-brainwashing and social topics to fun songs about roaming freely, beer and weed. Afterwards the band reformed to Hope Dies Last, a more serious and heavy hardcore band, which has broken up as well. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Non+Skid">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
