At the end of 2005, ex-members of GYOB (Carlos and Rafa) form a new project, still without name. They contact with R. Herrero (TERRORISTARS' ex-guitar) in search of a singer, and he  puts them in touch with Mero-Mero. After entering Mero-Mero to the voices, Herrero adds to the formation as the second guitarist.

After several months of essays, they enter the Sadman Studies at Madrid, August 2006, to record their first album, titled "Ultra-violencia". 12 tracks included, produced by Carlos Santos (also TERRORISTARS' ex-guitar and current guitar of CLAN INFECTO) that also has produced the works of RHESUS, ANOTHER KIND OF DEATH, CLAN INFECTO, MAGO DE OZ, VERSUS and KNIFE, among others. Finally, the masterizing will run at the expense of Tue Madsen (THE HAUNTED, SICK OF IT ALL, HIMSA, DAGOBA) the first week of October.

Now, the band is playing live around Spain. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cuernos+de+chivo">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
