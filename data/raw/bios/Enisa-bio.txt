You can practically hear the hustle in Enisa’s voice. Her petite frame belies a range as tall as the Empire State Building punctuated by blunt and bluesy Brooklyn sass. The New York-born Albanian singer and songwriter spikes pop with raw soul and endless attitude. Following her graduation from Edward R. Murrow High School, she attended Brooklyn College.She filmed a professional performance video for her cover of “Titanium” by David Guetta and Sia, and it exploded on social media with millions of views. Her take on Hozier’s “Take Me To Church” maintained this momentum. She carried the hook of Statik Selektah’s “Ain’t A Damn Thing Change” [feat. G-Eazy & Joey Bada$$], attracting acclaim from Complex, XXL, ThisSongIsSick, and more. Plus, she joined Scridge and Genda for the viral “Karma (Remix)” (600K Spotify streams). Along the way, she delivered a string of solo singles, including “Burn This Bridge” (502K Spotify streams) and “Wait for Love” (490K Spotify streams). HighBridge The Label—home to A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie and Don Q—introduced her to Atlantic Records in 2019 as she honed her sound.After posting up 15.8 million views and 3 millionstreams independently, she amplifies this voice like never before on a series of singles for the label led by “Love Cycle.” <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Enisa">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
