Hungarian heavy metal band "Fekete Sereg" was founded in 1995 by former members of "Will o' the Wisp".They combine the fast and heavy metal riffs with renaissance and baroque melodies.Their lyrical theme is Hungary in the medieval times.Their concerts are often very spectacular since knights and archers fight among medieval sets on the stage. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fekete+Sereg">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
