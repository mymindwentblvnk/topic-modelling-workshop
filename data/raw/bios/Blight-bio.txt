There are multiple bands that use the name Blight.

1. Sheets of wailing feedback wash over the proceedings unexpectedly mid-song. With the incessant, clanging industrial thud of Lansing as a soundtrack to their existence, the group was bound to sound  industrial. Literally. Blight sounds like machinery set in motion. And appropriately, all the parts worked together in unison, a single unit moving forward. Punctuated only by the aforementioned wash of pure noise, or the electrified tones of Tesco's trumpet, the band was propelled by a single-minded purpose. Blight's existence was short, fleeting even, but the energy expounded within that time period was visceral, intimidating, artful, and completely essential. Blight was important, and the din they created was a brilliant one.


2. Deranged and demented hardcore punk/noise from ex-members of Michigan legends The Fix & The Meatmen. Tesco Vee(vocals, electric trumpet) backed by Steve Miller(guitar), Mike Achtenberg(bass) and Pat Clark(drums). Blight released just this one EP and played only 5 shows in their four month existence before slipping into the afterthoughts of America's middle aged youth. For fans of gritty love and anyone liking their hardcore on the weirder side of things. Released by the mighty Touch & Go and seemingly impossible to find.

3. Instrumental Ambient/Experimental Black Metal from Pensacola, FL featuring ex members of Creator Destroyer and Ambush! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Blight">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
