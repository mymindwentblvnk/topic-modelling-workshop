Regressive was formed by Justas (bass, vocals) and Vytis (guitar) in 2008. Soon Vytenis (guitar) joined the band. The bandâ€™s main influences are Venom, Bathory, Celtic Frost, Darkthrone, Motorhead and other familiar bands. The idea of this band is to play familiar old school metal as the bands mentioned before did. This band says FUCK OFF!!! to all the progressive/technical metal bullshit. In autumn of 2009 drummer Vovan joined the band and in 2010 they have recorded a few demo tracks, which will be released as a split album with a Canadian band Gatekrashor <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Regressive">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
