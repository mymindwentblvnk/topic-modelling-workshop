Danish thrash/speed metal band created by drummer Anders Edal in 2006. Going through vast quantities of member changing, bassist Erik Arenfalk (who already played with Anders in the crossover band Under Al Kritik) joined in 2007 after the original lineup fell apart. The aim was playing old-school thrash/speed metal, a genre screaming for revival.

Continuing the bloodline through 2007 with various members in and out, and stable lead guitarist Thomas Buris filling the guitar space.
2008 was the year of finalizing the lineup. Vocalist Jonas Juul leaves the band in April, and the band is soon joined by shredding second guitarist Anders Sultan in July, closely followed by Austrian vocalist David Walcher who had just settled in the country. The band was immediately convinced by the Austrian's ripping vocals. Thomas left the band in the autumn, so a second guitarist was now the only thing needed. Enter Stefan Rose, close friend of Sultan and completer of the lineup.

In december 2008, the band released the three song demo SEXTASY. Now, in 2009, a compilation appearance, Hell Comes Around - The Second Coming, and a 2nd demo will be released around summer.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Phantomizer">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
