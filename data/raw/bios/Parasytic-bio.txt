Parasytic: Richmond, VA punx playing crust-metal with a backbone of peace-punk and homebrew. Includes members of Alabama Thunderpussy, Avail, Cannabis Corpse and Aghast. Church Hill crusties shredding like motherfuckers, ripping like Amebix and Carcass at the same time. Debut full length 'Hymn' came out in 2008. Its follow up, 'Poison Minds', was released in 2011. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Parasytic">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
