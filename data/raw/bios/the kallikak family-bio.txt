Andrew Peterson is the reclusive mastermind behind The Kallikak Family, a folk-grounded experimental group based in Chicago, IL. The Kallikak Family was founded in order to musically explore the writings of now discredited psychologist H.H. Goddard, famous for his purported coinage of the term "moron." Using the concept of "feeble-mindedness" as a starting point, the Kallikaks wrote catchy, overdriven songs about subjectivity, underestimation and the large, oppressive sun.

After a short stint as "tour bassist" for The Microphones (K Records), May 23rd 2007 discovered the Chicago underground noise movement, and embarked on a series of solo performances that combined an appreciation for ambient textures with a flair for performance art. May 23rd 2007's unsettlingly hilarious shows involved such bizaare elements as tape-delayed audience interaction, camping, and countless jokes dropped purposefully as lame ducks to universal discomfort. Peterson then spent a year in Portland, OR making contact micorphones with Adam Forkner (Yume Bitsu, [[[VVRSSNN]]]), Liam Singer (Tell All Records) and M. Ritchey (The Badger King, Dear Nora).

After the release of May 23rd 2007 and a summer tour with MANTA, Peterson settled in Berkeley, CA to explore what he calls "PURITY music," or "the sound a computer makes." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Kallikak+Family">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
