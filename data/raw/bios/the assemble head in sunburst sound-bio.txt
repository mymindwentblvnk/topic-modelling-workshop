Assemble Head in Sunburst Sound is a psychedelic rock band formed in San Francisco, California in the early 2000s.

Like a lost Fillmore broadcast scrambled in the ionosphere before crashing meteor-like into the Mojave sand—the Assemble Head in Sunburst Sound funnels a Technicolor panorama of California rock and roll history into soulful, high-energy nuggets of contemporary, bluesy choogle n’ fuzz and wistful moonbase laments.

Born in San Francisco in the dim dawn light of the new millennium, The Assemble Head In Sunburst Sound is built around a core of three musicians, Jefferson Marshall, Sunburst 3 (M.I.K.E. Lardas) and Charlie Saufley, who stumbled upon each other from divergent experiences in funk platter dealing, heavy space pop brewing, noise punk scrambling and a shared love of raga, Mudhoney and Pink Floyd.

A revolving auxiliary of players, including cartoonist and theremin poet extraordinaire Anderson Lanbridge, and keyboard ace Ray Castro often spices up the Assemble Head’s live destructo-happenings and recorded events. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Assemble+Head+In+Sunburst+Sound">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
