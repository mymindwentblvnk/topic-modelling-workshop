Hailing from the Hudson Valley region of Upstate NY, COLD WAR SURVIVOR delivers a brutal, in-your-face metal punch. Uniquely mixing elements of thrash, death, 80's metal and even hardcore, COLD WAR SURVIVOR is both mean and melodic, frantic and listenable, with a focus on delivering songs rather than collections of riffs. Gauranteed to melt your face off! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cold+War+Survivor">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
