WALDEINSAMKEIT is the name of the new artistic chapter in the music career of the catalonian songwriter Sathorys Elenorth ( Der Blaue Reiter, Narsilion, Endless Asylum, Fragile, Lugburz, Ordo Funebris, Sonata Aurea, Heura ). 
A fresh mixture between neofolk sonorities and poetry recited exclusively in german language, evoking deep passages about the philosophical human views about the introspective side of the life and our heritage with the nature, as an intrinsic part of ourself. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Waldeinsamkeit">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
