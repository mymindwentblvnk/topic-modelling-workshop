London five-piece, Pumarosa are a band who assembled from unexpected and varied quarters. Isabel met drummer Nick at a rehearsal for a new band in a rundown pub forming a guitar-and-drums Punk duo and began writing and rehearsing in the basement. After moving to a warehouse they met Henry, Tomoya and Neville and began a period of intensely hot rehearsals.
In the summer of 2015, the band was offered a residency in the cavernous disused cinema of an Italian surrealist, situated within the cliffs of Calabria. Scraping together a van and driving non-stop to Italy, the band worked on new material in beguiling forty degree heat, developing further their expansive sound. It was also in Italy that they settled on the name PUMAROSA: in part reflecting Isabel’s Chilean roots, but also the lurid-looking jungle fruit of the same name.
In September 2015 Pumarosa released debut single “Priestess’, produced by Mercury-nominated Dan Carey (Kate Tempest, Bat For Lashes, Toy) via Chess Club / Mom + Pop (US). Zane Lowe on Beats 1 had the world’s first play and within three days Preiestress was the second most blogged about song worldwide. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pumarosa">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
