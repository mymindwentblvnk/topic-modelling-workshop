Hollow Haze formed in 2003 by Nick Savio with the idea to put together a new original “Hard & Heavy” sound. After some sessions at Remaster Studio, the soul of the band was strongly outlined and just a fews months later the first outset album “Hollow Haze” (My Graveyard Productions – 2006) was released. At the end of 2008 the band signed for Crash & Burn records…The second album “The Hanged Man” got a great response from magazine and hard and heavy web sites…A great step ahead for the band!!!! With a great production Hollow Haze outlined once and for all their “big heavy dark” sound. The official videoclip of "Coming from Hell" was released on December. On January 2011 the new album “End of a dark Era” got great feedback from the music business and several shows followed the album release. Thanks to a new management deal with Alpha Omega management on 2012, the band has been on tour with TARJA around Europe. On march 2012 an headliner Israel mini tour get a great response from magazine and web site. On June another great opportunity: A deal with Bakertem records for the new album Poison in Black recorded at Remaster Studio. On September the band released the new videoclip "Haunting the Sinner". HOLLOW HAZE offers an Hard & Heavy Metal mixed with a screaming, warm melodic voice and deep intensive chorus where the listeners can find many different music backgrounds taken from the past metal glories and from the modern rock compositions. Thanks to their passion and hard work the group face every music style and innovations, trying to be competitive in the world-wide stage with their new 4th album "Poison in Black"!!!!.
