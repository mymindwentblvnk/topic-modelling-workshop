Goetic Circle is a one man drone/doom project.  Very minimalist when it comes to the use of instruments, there are very little to no drums, heavily fuzzed guitars drench in reverb and delay, and tons of ominous sound clips.  His riffs are faster and more interesting that fellow droners such as Ox or Sunn 0))).   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Goetic+Circle">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
