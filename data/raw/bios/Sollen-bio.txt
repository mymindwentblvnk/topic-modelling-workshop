Sollen was founded in 2001 in Hungary by Norbert Csörgő (drums), Krisztián Czipó (bass) and Viktor Kovács (guitar). The band's musical style, which can best be described as the mixture of traditional trash and melodic Scandinavian metal, slowly developed throughout continuous member recruitments and member changes. The present setup was established, after in 2004 Ádám Nagy (guitar), and almost a year after, in 2005 András Földesi (lead vocals) joined the band. The band has regularly performed on concerts since the end of 2005. They recorded a 3 song demo in 2006, under domestic circumstances. Now they are working on their second demo, but meanwhile they regularly have concerts in small as well as in large clubs.
