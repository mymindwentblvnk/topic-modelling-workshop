Formed back in 1992 by Niklas Axelsson, Joakim Bergenvall and André Teilmann as a doom-death act under the name "Tears of Luna". Joined in 1993 by singer Dennis Liljedahl they started to write their own material and soon their first demo "The Journey" (1994) saw the light of day. Even though the line-up wasn't very consistent they managed to record a second demo, "Sky dancer" (1995). 

"Time Circles" (1996) was the first release under the name In Grey. The band was then more or less on hold while Niklas studied. Returning again with "Seasons Change" (1999), Dennis Starkenberg had replaced André Teilmann behind the drums. "Mask" (2000) saw the band turn more to the Paradise Lost/Anathema kind of metal which they refined on "Above"(2001). The struggle with members dropping off continued but in 2002 they found a permanent bass player in Per Lindström who also brought in Daniel Cannerfelt on guitar. This allowed In Grey to perform more live shows and even gained them a mini-tour in Latvia. With new aims in their work they made the self produced debut "Sulphur Tears" (2003).

However that line-up was not to last. Joakim Croneström replaced vocalist Dennis Liljedahl, leaving Niklas the only remaining original member. Also Guitarist Igor Jevtic and keyboardist Fredrik Klingwall joined the ranks of In Grey. The recordings of this setting can be heard on the release MMIV (2004) and XII (2004). Later that year Igor left and In Grey went in to record their second album "Liyah". 

In Grey have just released their second full length album - Liyah... 

Per and Fredrik left the band after the recording of Liyah, and a new member Christian Edström joined and now that Liyah is released In Grey are planning their 3rd album with the working title "On Our Last Day".  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/In+Grey">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
