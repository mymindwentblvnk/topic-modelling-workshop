"Magni Animi Viri" has a long range of musical experience; its Maestros Giancarlo Trotta and Luca Contegiacomo have both a musical background. The first has a classical formation, while the latter a progressive-rock one. Magni Animi Viri began as a project with a precise objective: create and realize an important "Rock Opera".


The difficulty was to combine everything in a uniform and well-balanced manner, two different "worlds" while trying to obtain contemporarily a warm and harmonious sound from a symphonic orchestra. Simple melodies at times sung by a strong and proud classical voice, like the one from a tenor, others by a sweet but raw feminine voice.
Even from a literary point of view, the fusion of sentiment and contrasting emotions reflect the hybrid musical soul of the work, giving it the right lyrical atmosphere through a marvellous modulation of emotions.
