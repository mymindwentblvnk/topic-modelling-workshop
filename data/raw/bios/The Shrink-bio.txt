There have been two The Shrinks. One was an indie rock band from North Carolina that disbanded in 2007, the other is a Chilean metal band. 

THE SHRINK (Chilean Metal Band)

Four musicians with different experiences got together to satisfy their musical necessities and formed “The Shrink”. The main idea was to look inside and develop a style of their own, instead of going with the trend of the moment or simply copying a particular band. The style is imminently METAL, mixing a heavy rhythmic foundation with vocals that are way more melodic than what most people would expect. Out of that mix you get songs with lots of power and energy with interesting vocal lines and lyrics. Releasing a demo tape in January 1995, the band started to develop a following. Later releases were “MIND SABOTAGE” (1998), followed by “CYCLE OF DOOM” (2002) and “POST HUMAN” (2004), the band starting evolving in a more extreme sound, mixing heavier riffs with melodic vocal lines. The current line up is conformed by Christian Solari on lead vocals, Franco Lama on guitar and backing vocals, Andres Torres on drums and Sandro Trabucco on bass. Now with their new album “Break New Ground” (2008), they have taken their musicianship to a higher level, aimed to international audience. International shows: Hellish Tour '08 Helloween - GammaRay April 13 Santiago Chile.
