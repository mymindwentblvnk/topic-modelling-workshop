Forming in the later months of 2004, Baptized In Blood have been blazing a trail ever since. Influenced by everything from Gothenburg to glam—as long as it's distorted—this London, Ontario-based five-piece runs the metallic gamut, creating a sound that is technically-inspired yet groove oriented and anthemnic in the same throw. Baptized In Blood are keepers of a sonic singularity that has established them as one of modern metal's most forthright, furious and frenetic heavy music bands to date, an aural prowess and thunderous dominance perfectly encapsulated on the band's sophomore effort/Roadrunner Records debut Baptized In Blood.
