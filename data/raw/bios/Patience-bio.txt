There are multiple artists with the name "Patience":

1) Patience is an alias of Roxanne Clifford from Veronica Falls. The Church / My Own Invention were released on Night School Records in May 2016.

2)  Patience began tentatively in the basement of a small-town home in Culleoka, Tennessee. Bassist Charlie Dungy had the beginnings of a band formed and needed a vocalist. Lakota Gordon was more than happy to answer the ad and began practicing with the then 3-piece band. After searching, Mason Dickerson was found through a friend as a drummer. Newly named Patience, the band moved into a practice space in Nashville and began writing.  After more than a few guitar players, the slots were finally filled with Mark McClanahan and Miles Stelzig.

The band played their first show with the curren line-up in February of 2007.  They were offered studio time to track an EP with local producer/engineer Kyle Mann.

After  work at Tombstone Studios in Nashville with Mann, the band released their 5 track EP, Just Wait, in August 2007. With barely six months under their belt, Patience played their CD release show on August 3rd to a sold-out crowd at The Rutledge.
