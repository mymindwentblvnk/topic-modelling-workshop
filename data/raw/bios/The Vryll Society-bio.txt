According to their facebook page

 Locked away in their subterranean rehearsal space for more than a year, The Vryll Society have been creating a complex body of work, to stimulate both the soul and mind. Long days of liquid jams and crafted song writing, laced with touches of Funkadelic, Aphrodites Child and Krautrock has seen a rich ocean of sound come to the surface.
