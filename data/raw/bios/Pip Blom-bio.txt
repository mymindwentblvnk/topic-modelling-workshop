Pip Blom (born 1996) is a musician, singer and songwriter based in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Pip Blom is also the name of her four-piece indie rock band.

"Never listen to people who want to change your music." With that advice from a fellow musician Amsterdam based Pip Blom (19, at the time) started writing songs. First with a three string Loog guitar, with the 14-track demo album Short Stories (2013) as a result. 

Three years and an array of singles later, her sound had shifted into Courtney Barnett and The Breeders territory. The 'little girl with a guitar' had formed a fully-fledged indie rock band line-up. But it is still Pip. 

Pip Blom's d√©but full-length, Boat, was released in 2019 on Heavenly. The band performed at many festivals in The Netherlands, United Kingdom and beyond, from Lowlands to 'Glasto', and is now selling out venues as a headline act in the U.K.
