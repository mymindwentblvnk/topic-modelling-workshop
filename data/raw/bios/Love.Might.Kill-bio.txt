LOVE.MIGHT.KILL was founded in 2009 by FIREWIND/ULI JON ROTH/METALIUM-drummer MICHAEL EHRÉ. After touring all around the world with several bands and writing songs for German-metallers METALIUM, Japanese-female-metal-vocalist SAEKO or ex-ZED YAGO-founder JUTTA WEINHOLD, he realised his vision of an own band by writing, recording and producing LOVE.MIGHT.KILLs debut-album BRACE FOR IMPACT.

In addition with the brilliant Italian-singer JAN MANENTI as a co-writer, long-time-friends CHRISTIAN STÖVER and STEFAN ELLERHORST (who were both playing in German-based-metalband CROSSROADS) on guitars and JOGI SWEERS on bass LOVE.MIGHT.KILLs outstanding line-up was completed.

BRACE FOR IMPACT features 13 stunning melodic-metal-tracks in the tradition of the bands longtime favourites like f.e. RAINBOW, JUDAS PRIEST, DIO or BLACK SABBATH. Michaels production and MARKUS TESKEs mix (SAGA, VANDEN PLAS, SPOCKS BEARD) underwrite the fact that LOVE.MIGHT.KILLs debut-album will convince all melodic-metal-maniacs all around the world.
