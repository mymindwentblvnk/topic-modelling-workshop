Serdaroth is a metal band from Skopje, Macedonia founded by guitarist and producer Milan Tasevski. It started as a personal metal project in 2012 when Milan decided that he should embark on a quest to create a solo metal album that reflected his creativity and vision at the moment. After almost a year and a half of composing and recording, the album finally came out in December 2013, with Milan on all instruments and growls, Aleksandar Vujic on the clean vocals, Aleksandar Ilievski as a guest guitarist on one song and Kalin Markovic â€“ Masniot (Furion) also as a guest vocalist on one song. The album was recorded, mixed and mastered at Milan's private home studio - Sobaroom Studios and published under his own label AFX Records.

After the release, Milan set out to find a band that would play the songs. He already had the second guitarist in Alek Ilievski, but Vujic couldn't proceed as the clean vocalist due to private matters, and so the search for the other members started. Kristijan Todorov - Todor on drums, Andrej Kolarovski - Babata on bass, Anastasija Bogdanovska on keyboards and Baze Petrovski as the main vocalist all joined the band at various periods.
Serdaroth has played at local events and festivals, including the Wacken Metal Battle competition held in Skopje in 2014. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Serdaroth">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
