Co La is the new exotica music of Matt Papich (Ecstatic Sunshine). People are calling it “Fresh” and “Evocative”. It’s New Anything Bass Music, kind of, but also part of the new Its Not Everything sound. Do you like Flow Motion by Can? Have you seen “O.C. and Stiggs”? Imagine skimming for a sweet spot and finding cool confusion – Pop Music For Dream Life. Are you too wise to live straight? Whose tears are superior? Post-Honeypot era New Reggae. Also, do you have flying dreams? Do you feel new solidarity with a global potential? Looney Tunes. Be real with a wall of sound, and slip a finger in your ear delicately. Feel successful at night. Playing conceptual footsy with predictive text and the future says “Co La?”.
