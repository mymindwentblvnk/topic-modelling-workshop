The Lumineers is an American folk rock band based in Denver, Colorado formed by Wesley Schultz (lead vocals, guitar) and Jeremiah Fraites (drums, percussion). Schultz and Fraites began writing and performing together in Ramsey, New Jersey in 2005. Cellist and vocalist Neyla Pekarek joined the band in 2010, and was a member until 2018.

The band's debut self-titled album was released on April 3, 2012. The album's first single, "Ho Hey" reached #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #1 on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart.

The Ho Hey Songfacts reports that Schultz and Fraites were originally based in New York and started collaborating in 2002 after Fraites’ brother, Josh, who was also Schultz’s best friend died of an overdose. The pair began writing and performing to cope with their grief and they later relocated to Denver, where they met the classically trained Pekarek after advertising for a cellist. 

Their self-titled debut album The Lumineers was released on April 3, 2012, on Dualtone Records. 

Their second album, Cleopatra, was released in 2016. 

The band's third album, titled III, was released on September 13, 2019 and debuted at No. 2 on the US Billboard 200.
