Mindflair was founded in Kaiserslautern, Germany in 1994. Starting as a fast death metal band, the band evolved with the years towards a hard to describe kind of mixture between crust, grind, groove and power violence. In November 1996 the debut demo was released. Half a year later the second one is released too. In January ‘98 the third and last demo is recorded “The multi-orgasmic-man”.

In the middle of that same year Napalmed records released a split tape with Four Seats For Invalides, at almost the same time a live split tape with Utopie was released. In May ‘98 Mindflair recorded the stuff for their split CD with Belching Beet (Deliria productions).

In May of ‘99, Bones Brigade records released the split MCD with Running Guts. End of July ‘00 PW productions released a split 10″ with Suppository.

The band’s first full-length album, “Green bakery”, came out in November ‘02 through Bones Brigade records. The second full-length, “Stagnation”, came out in June of ‘05 also through Bones Brigade records.

The newest release by Mindflair’s a split MCD / 7″ with Sanity’s Dawn which came out in September ‘08 through Power-It-Up. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mindflair">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
