Caveat is a band to watch, having been recognized as one of the most energetic and promising acts coming out of Western Canada as well as making their mark on the international scene.
   
Having formed in Calgary, Alberta in 2004, Caveat have showcased their steady writing and musical growth, resulting in a multi-layered musical complexity that breaks all rules of conventionality.   A testament to their success is the charting of their latest album "Red" on top 10 metal charts across Canada steadily for nearly 4 months after its release.
  
Caveat has been called "in a league of their own", "both sweet and scalding" and "bends the metal, twists it, heats it up and leaves it on the cold hard ground as a pool of hot bubbling molting thrash metal masterpiece."  Their latest album "Red" is "so fresh and new that its hot!" and "the hybrid emerges as the Canadian prairies' signature sound."
  
They are distributed throughout the UK and Europe via Cargo Records, in Canada and the US through Bullseye/Fusion3 and online through all major retailers (iTunes, Napster, eMusic, etc.).  A tour for the summer of 2008 is currently in the works.

Caveat is Greg Musgrave, Terry Baldwin, Joe Sikorski and Casey Rogers.
