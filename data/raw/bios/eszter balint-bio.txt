Born in Budapest, Hungary in 1966, singer/actress/violinist Eszter Balint first emerged as a member of the avant-garde Squat Theater troupe. In 1984 she made her cinematic debut in director Jim Jarmusch's seminal indie film Stranger Than Paradise. From there she seemed to drop out of sight for the remainder of the decade, not reappearing on-screen until 1990's little-seen Bail Jumper. Small roles in The Linguini Incident and Trees Lounge followed as Balint instead focused more and more of her energies on music, and in 1999 she released her full-length debut Flicker. She also recorded violin on several albums produced by Michael Gira. During 2006 she participated in a documentary Wanderlust with many other well known people.
