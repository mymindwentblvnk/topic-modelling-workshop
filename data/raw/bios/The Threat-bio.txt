There are several bands that go by the name of "The Threat".

1. The Threat were one of the first post-punk bands of Dublin, Ireland, consisting of Maurice Foley (guitar, vocals), Larry Murphy (bass) and Paul 'Mono' Monahan (drums). They only played three gigs and released one single, "Lullaby in C/High Cost of Living". After the band split up, Paul and Larry went on to start Chant! Chant! Chant!.

2. Metal band from South Wales UK. The Threat shared the stage with the likes of All shall perish, Job For A Cowboy, Terror, Shattered Realm, Knuckledust, Six Ft. Ditch, Arkangel, Desecration amongst others... 

3. Four friends wanted to form a punk rock and roll band that embraced the spirit of the bands they idolized: The Stooges, Rocket From the Crypt, The Misfits, X, and Motorhead, among many others. Combine those influences with intense, high-energy live shows and youve got yerself a crew called The Threat.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Threat">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
