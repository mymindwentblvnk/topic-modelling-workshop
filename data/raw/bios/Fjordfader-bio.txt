During a warm, boring day mid-june 2010, a group of kids in the surroundings of Bergen, Norway came together for the sake of making some fierce, viking-spirit music. Fjordfader was the product, and the product was good. So good, in fact, that the group of kids could not bear the thought of not letting the rest of the world hear it.

By blending blackened thrash and epic melodies of the past, Fjordfader is a force to be reckoned with. The band is currently recording their debut, which is yet to be named. The band is also looking for partners in distribution.
