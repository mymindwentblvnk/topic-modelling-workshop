Buried deep within one of the most god-fearing parts of the USA, the Iowa heartland, Nethervoid formed in 2006 through a need to artistically combat the religious majority. The demo "Templar of the Judas Goat" was bore and the live demonstrations started, supported by Visigoth, Berith, a drum machine, and the ritualistic bible burning. Mortaeous and Die rounded out the positions of drummer and bassist soon thereafter. "Sirens of the Blistering Light" was released in October of 2008 to acclaim in the USBM underground. Supported by a number of tour dates throughout the end of 2008-2009, Nethervoid gathered a strong cult following through an unrelenting and blasphemous live show. In 2011, Nethervoid storms back into the metal underground with "In Swarms of Godless Wrath", a quick sonic assault of anti-religious buckshot right into the chest of the church. "Cresting like waters of a flood, we end this drought, and it storms Christian blood!" <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nethervoid">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
