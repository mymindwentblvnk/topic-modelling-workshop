My Own Mess was started in 2002 by basplayer Camiel Drent and drummer Len Berner. It first was meant to be a punk/rock coverband, but when guitarplayer Sander Pieters and leadsinger Dennis Volkerink joined, they started playing Trashmetal. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/My+Own+Mess">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
