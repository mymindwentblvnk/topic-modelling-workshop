Dark Fount is a black metal artist from China. The current line up consists of Li Tao, who plays all the instruments & writes his own material. Lyrical themes involve, darkness, depression & misanthropy. 

To date, Dark Fount has released one album "A Sapless Leave Withering in the Night Fog" in 2007. 
This album is doomy traditional black metal.  Slightly raw, and featuring some Burzum-laden tendencies, A Sapless Leave Withering in the Night Fog is a melancholic trip into the dark wilderness of China's landscapes.  At times, the riffs take us away from the world of depression and hate though into a more playful sound, almost like an apparition dancing in the mists.  A ghostly childlike figure defying time and physics, curving the air about it in a ghastly but graceful waltz.  Yes, this is misanthropic black metal, but the music holds a definite character that isn't seen elsewhere in the black metal world. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dark+Fount">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
