Former members of power/progressive metal band AliansA had an idea of creating a band which will have the best young musicians from Novi Sad, after some talks with their friends and musicians the band was created, the band joined, beside Vanja Andric (ex-Aliansa) and Srdjan Golubica (ex-Aliansa,ex-Sangre Eterna), Uros Maric on lead vocals (ex-Aoora), Aleksandar Gabric (Erupcija) on bass,and Dimitrije Mladenovic (Third Gallery) keybords. They have come together thanks to similar musical influence (Kamelot, Judas Priest, Sonata Arctica, Primal Fear, Stratovarius, Adagio...) and great talent in each member has lead on making songs that are a unique combination of heavy, power, progressive and a bit of melodic death metal, the band is currently having rehearsals and in writing phase and it's getting ready to conquer the world!!! Due to to musical and ohter differences the badn have parted ways with Uros and Aleksandar and on their place found two extremely talented musicians,on lead vocals the band  found Milos Krsmanovic (ex Midgard) which talent and unique voice gives the band its final touch and a recogniseable note and on bass guitar came bands friend Laza Dabic from Third Gallery!!! With the new lineup the band has entered the studio and recorded its first EP, which has 3 tracks and the band will now concentrate on promoting the material and on gigs also as on writing new material!!!!

Milos Krsmanovic - lead vocals
