Mizan was founded in 1996 by Can Isik, as a solo project featuring various artists. After winning a national music contest with the demo CD «prehistoric carma» He put together the heart of the band as a trio. Together with Andi Jud (Drums, Percussion, Engineering) and Tom Buergin (Guitars, Data-Frets) and Can Isik (Vocals, Keyboards, Programming) Mizan started playing concerts all over Europe which brought an international record deal with Universal Music. In 1998 they started recording their first album «angelized» which was published all over Europe, Japan and South East Asia. The music back than was a fusion of electronic elements and rock music.

The album «angelized» was finally released in summer 2000. The release was backed up by a tour and two video clips. After two years touring the band concentrated on a new project. 

In 2003 Mizan decided to quit working on the follow-up album and decided to start again with a brand new concept. Can Isik wanted desperately to bring in his own cultural roots from his turkish father’s side into the project. Therefore the songwriting focused on combining oriental turkish music elements with a more basic alternative rock sound with little electronic influence.
