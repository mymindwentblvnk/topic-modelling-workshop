Pesante is currently a one-man project based out of Las Vegas, NV. It is ran and produced by bass player/composer Tim Harpster. The music is very distinct, in that only basses are used rather than the conventional guitar/bass mix. The music itself can go from ambient to melodic to technical, and is very progressive. 

Pesante is a term used commonly by classical musicians that means "to play with a heavy style"
