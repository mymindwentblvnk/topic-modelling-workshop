Greg Davis plays everything from guitar to khaen to gongs to synthesizer to pine cones to laptop and more. He primarily works as a solo musician but has worked in a variety of musical situations with Jeph Jerman, Zach Wallace (as Sun Circle), Keith Fullerton Whitman, Sebastien Roux, Steven Hess, Joseph Grimm and Akron/Family. Davis has released lots of music on labels such as Carpark, Kranky, Important, Tompkins Square, Tonschacht, Room40, Ghostly and more. He has toured and travelled around the world sharing his openness to all sounds and musical experiences. Davis makes his home in Burlington, Vermont where he works on music, audio mastering and has been active in developing a new scene for other musics.
