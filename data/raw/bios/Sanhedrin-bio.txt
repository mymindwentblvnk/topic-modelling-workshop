Sanhedrin was originally formed by Reece Holloway & Parmahn Azad, two like-minded individuals who wanted to explore their interests in Black & Death Metal. The group was formed in early 2009 in Huddersfield, England.

3. Sanhedrin Japan: 
Japanese avant-rock/experimental/improv group formed by guitarist Keiji Haino (Fushitsusha, etc.), drummer Tatsuya Yoshida (Ruins, Koenji Hyakkei, etc.) and bassist Mitsuru Nasuno (Altered States, Korekyojinn, etc.) in the mid 2000s. It inherited a similar avant-prog sensibility to that of the earlier group Knead, which included Haino and Yoshida but with a different bassist Sasaki Hisashi. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sanhedrin">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
