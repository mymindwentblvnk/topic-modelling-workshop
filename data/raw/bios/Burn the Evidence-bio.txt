Burn the Evidence, or B.T.E., is a British alternative-metal edge band from Worthing, formed in 2007. B.T.E. was founded when rhythm guitarist Mark Fox met lead guitarist Rob Erskine while working in a DIY store, and from their mutual tastes in heavy music and love of playing guitar they decided to form a band. With a few changes along the way, the band rested upon a stable and successful line-up with Mark and Rob being joined by Chris Sedlmayr on drums and Jason Batt on Bass. Their first of many local live appearances was in July 2008. 2009 saw a final line-up change, with Carl Toppin taking over Bass guitar duties. This new addition has enabled the band to develop a great song writing and playing dynamic. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Burn+The+Evidence">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
