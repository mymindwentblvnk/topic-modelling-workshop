Nordic Melodic Metal hailing from Gothenburg, Sweden est. 2004. Join the storm!

It all began in 2004…
Two hard rocking dudes called Stefan and Freddy met in a Volvo Truck factory, and quickly came to the conclusion that something had to be done, or else they would be stuck in there forever. They both loved their rock (influences such as Halloween), and both of them wanted to be rock stars, so why not start a band?
Last Kingdom was formed by the singer Stefan Jacobsen and the former guitarist Freddy Olofsson. They immediately started to write some songs together. But just two guys was not enough to start the band, so the search for more Last Kingdom’nians started.

After slight lineup changes, Stefan recruited Therese Gunnarsson on Vocals, Stefan Malmenlid on Keys, brother Jimmy Malmenlid on Bass, Sven Hansson Bom on Guitars and Daniel Bernstrom on Drums, Last Kingdom’s chemistry was flawless and ready to push on.

Last Kingdom’s first gig was at Musikens Hus in Gothenburg, and since then have performed alongside acts such as Dragonland, Wolf and many other acts throughout the Nordic regions, and have graced the stage of Waken Metal Battle in Gothenburg.

The bands first album ‘Chronicles of The North’, was mixed by Andy LaRoque and after being picked up by Limb records, was released in March 2012 with a huge response worldwide.

In recent months, Last Kingdom have not only been preparing their second album ‘Dream Captin’ (release TBC) but have also signed a world wide deal with Metal Music Bookings & Management, so watch this space for news coming soon! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Last+Kingdom">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
