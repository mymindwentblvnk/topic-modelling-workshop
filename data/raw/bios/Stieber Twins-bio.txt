The two brothers, Martin (Marshall Mar, a.k.a. Martin Jekyll) and Christian (Luxus Chris a.k.a. Christian Hyde) form the HipHop group "Stieber Twins". Their HipHop activities started in the mid 80's during their high-school years. Besides their music both have been active in graffiti and breakdancing.
 
The Twins' muscial career started in the 90's with the appearance of the track "Graffiti interlude", an instrumental, on the Mzee Sample "Alte Schule" in 1993. Another instrumental, "Breakers revenge", also marked the entrance of the two brothers into German HipHop music. However, first raps did not appear before 1995 on the Mzee Sampler "Klasse von 95'" in form of the track "Allein zu Zweit". Their first album called "Fenster zum Hof" appeard in 1997. Together with Aphroe (Raid), Curse, Busy, Tatwaffe and STF they formed "La Familia" producing the 12" vinyl "Harte Zeiten/Wallstreet" (1998) before coming out with the single "Malaria/Schlangen sind giftig" in 1999 featuring Max Herre. In 2000 they released a reprint instrumental of 1998 (800trek, limited ed: 2000)LP (vinyl) called "Twin Plastic - Raw Cut Instrumentals" on Mzee records, before releasing another instrumental LP "Twin plastic - speechless" on their "Twinity records" in 2006. 
Since 1995 they have been active in features, remixes or production of various kind. Among them being collaborations with Curse, EinsZwo, Fettes Brot, Sammy Deluxe, Max Herre, Fishmob, Turntablerocker, Cora E, Advanced Chemisty, McRene or artists like J-Luv of 3p a Frankfurt based label. The latter caused criticism from some fans due to 3p's reputation of being more profit oriented running somewhat contrary to their image focussing on "realness" and non major label influence which can be found in their lyrics or interviews statements. All in all they are well connected and respected throughout the German HipHop/Rap scene.

Since 1999 fans are waiting for the second non-instrumental album presumebly called "Algebra".

Trivia:
While one of the brothers is currently concentrating on his studies in architecture, the other is taking care of his hiphop shop "The Flame" that can be found in downtown Heidelberg (Pl√∂ck 91, 69117 Heidelberg). Both are also members of the local political group called "Generation.hd". Nevertheless, both remain active in HipHop.
