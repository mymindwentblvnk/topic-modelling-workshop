Dan Auerbach (born Daniel Quine Auerbach on 14 May 1979 in Akron, Ohio) is an American musician. A multi-instrumentalist, Auerbach is best-known as the guitarist and vocalist for The Black Keys, a blues/rock group from Akron, Ohio.

Auerbach grew up in a family with musical roots. His second cousin once removed was the late guitarist Robert Quine, an American guitarist known for his innovative guitar solos. Auerbach became infatuated with blues music during his childhood after being exposed to old records by his father. Auerbach often uses an index finger fingerpick along with his thumb to play chords, a technique similar to many earlier blues players. 

Formerly of the three piece Akron band The Barnburners from 2000 until 2002, Auerbach formed The Black Keys with drummer Patrick Carney.

Auerbach released a solo album - Keep It Hid - in 2009. Auerbach played most of the instruments on the album, with his cousin James Quine contributing rhythm guitar on two songs and harmony vocals on two more. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dan+Auerbach">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
