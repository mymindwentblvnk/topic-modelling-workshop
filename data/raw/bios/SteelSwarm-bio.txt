Bio: 


Fast, Catchy, Addictive music that sticks in your brain like shit to a blanket.

A force of high-energy hair-flailing head-banging destruction, Sydney’s SteelSwarm are inspired by real metal

SteelSwarm performances are full of high energy anger fuelled metal madness, it’s never a boring show with SteelSwarm on the bill.

Forged in a hellish jail like room brothers Dane and Jamie started creating the head crushing rhythms of SteelSwarm in 2007.

After spending five years in solitary confinement they abandoned everything else to chase the metal in April 2012.

SteelSwarm have released their debut EP 'The Ultimate Offering' and are now on tour with big plans ahead. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/SteelSwarm">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
