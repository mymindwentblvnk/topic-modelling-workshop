DREMORA was a female-fronted symphonic metal project from Los Angeles, CA USA that mashed raw thrash metal with classical symphonic orchestration which was then polished with female operatic rock vocals, and snarling male gutturals. 

The project was formed April 2006 by the drummer & songwriter Thomas K. November 2006 Juliana Novo from Brazil joined as lead vocalist. The project was retired in 2008, and both artists moved on to form new bands. Juliana went on to perform in "Noctis Notus", and "Crucifixion BR",  while Thomas went on to form a new 6-pc symphonic metal band called "Ashentide" in Los Angeles.

Dremora's only release was an EP entitled MARTYRS that contained 4 tracks, and went on sale August 4th, 2007. It is available from select major retailers as a Digipak CD collectors edition, or a digital MP3 download. Dremora was also part of two compilation albums. 'A World of Sirens' released August 2008 by Sonic Cathedral & Nuclear Blast, and 'Ferocity and Femininity' released July 2008 by Anthem Records NL.

The album in both digital and CD formats can be purchased off the project's official MySpace page:
