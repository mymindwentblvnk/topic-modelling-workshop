Orinoco Haven is a guitar combo, that has received its inspiration for a long time through a residence in Venezuela. They lived in the most beautiful and in different places along the Orinoco River, where the world still remains in a lovely condition. But Orinoco Haven wasn't just influenced by traditional Latin-American guitar music, they also used to have a large interest in the guitar standards in pop and folk music as well as in the adaption of well-known evergreens for acoustic guitar.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Orinoco+Haven">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
