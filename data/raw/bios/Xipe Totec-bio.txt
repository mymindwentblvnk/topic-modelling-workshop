Xipe Totec is a Death Metal band from Cuautitlan Izcalli, Mexico. Xipe Totec means "Our Lord the Flayed One," and was the life/death/rebirth deity of the Aztec people. In annual rituals to honour this god, human sacrifices were flayed alive and the nearly whole skins we were worn by the priests during the ritual. The band released a demo in 1998.

Xipe Totec is also a DC-based collective of musicians and performance artists, dedicated to 'unique sounds.' 

There is also an Australian Doom/Death Metal band under the name Xipe Totec.  Their only album from 2002 is called Volklore. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Xipe+Totec">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
