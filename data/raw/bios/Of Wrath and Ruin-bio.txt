Of Wrath And Ruin traces its roots to 2004; after several incarnations, founders Pat Brose and Joe Brannigan finally found the right people to deliver the band's unique progressive-metal style. During one stint as ‘The Heliand,’ Pat and Joe met vocalist Laura Tyburski. A deep musical chemistry evolved among the three as they worked together over the a period of years. The combination of Pat’s death-metal vocal style and Laura’s clean vocals is one of the characteristics that make OfWAR special. The members  feel that bands such as Dream Theater, Opeth, Nevermore, Dark Tranquility, Children of Bodom, and Nightwish have heavily influenced their music. 

Pat Brose has been the driving force behind the music, writing and recording almost all of the music singlehandedly. In early 2009, producer Steve Childs offered to work with Pat on a full-length album. They had known each other for almost a decade; having heard many of Pat's home recordings, Steve was confident that the album would be successful. Pat began tracking the guitars, bass, drums, keyboards, and death-metal vocals. Shortly after the recording began, Joe began learning all the rhythm-guitar parts from the album. In early 2010, drummer Ryan Welikonich joined the band. At that time, the group decided to include more clean vocals, so they brought Laura into the studio as a new singer. 

Steve introduced Of Wrath And Ruin to Apollyon Records in 2010, and the band was quickly signed. OfWAR released its debut album, "Conquering Oblivion," in early 2011. Although it has just nine tracks, each song is its own epic journey, as is common with progressive metal. The ultimate result is, as Ryan says, “A one-hour-long molten slab of metal.” <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Of+Wrath+And+Ruin">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
