Deathcore/death metal out of Birmingham, Alabama.

Trapaw began in 2005 as a solo project to William Ambridge as sort of offshoot to his main band at the time, writing a four song EP entitled You Fucking Bastard. After leaving his main band in 2009, William began writing more seriously for Trapaw, using the name Edward Callaway as a pen name. In late 2010, Trapaw released its first full length album entitled Bury The Living. The album made the rounds on the underground metal scene, but never got terribly popular.

In early 2011, William released a split album with a good friend of his, the Aegri Somnia split with Wisconsin based pornographic gore grind band Meat Truck Mix Tape.  In late 2011, early 2012, Trapaw had released several of the songs slated for its upcoming release entitled Civil. At that time, William was contacted by a promoter and urged to take Trapaw to the local stage. Agreeing, Trapaw found a rough lineup and played its first show on February 19th much to the delight of their fans.  After a lineup change, Trapaw is working on gigging full time. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Trapaw">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
