Mats Gustafsson (born 1964 in Umeå) is a Swedish saxophone player and a stalwart on the Scandinavian free jazz scene.

He first came to the attention of lovers of improvised music as part of a duo with Christian Munthe (started in 1986) and the band Gush (started in 1988). He has later played widely with musicians such as Peter Brötzmann, Joe McPhee, Paul Lovens, Barry Guy and Derek Bailey.

Since the early 1990s, Mats Gustafsson has been a regular visitor to the U.S., forming a particular affinity with Chicago musicians such as Hamid Drake, Michael Zerang and Ken Vandermark and recording for the city's OkkaDisk label.

In addition to projects with musicians, Mats Gustafsson has worked extensively with artists from the worlds of dance, theatre, poetry and painting. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mats+Gustafsson">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
