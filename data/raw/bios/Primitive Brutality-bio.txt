Primitive Brutality is Roger J. Beaujard's side project for things that don't fit in Mortician or Malignancy. The project dates back to 1989 before Mortician (formely known as Casket) begun and it can give you some insight of where part of the Mortician sound came from. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Primitive+Brutality">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
