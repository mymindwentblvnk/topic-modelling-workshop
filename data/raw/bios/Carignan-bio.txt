Carignan was originally founded as an idea of a death metal project in early summer of 2006. Bernhard (Vocals) and David (Bass) were looking for a guitarist. After coming across Peter, he joined the band. Finally Claudio (Drums) joined the band and completed the original line up. Carignan was born and they started to write their first songs. After the first jamming sessions the music style developed to a even faster and more brutal one: Bitchslapping Deathgrind!. Because of lack of time, David left the band in spring 2007. In the course of 2007 they played their first Gig and supported bands like Spasm, Vulvathrone, Sanatorium, Sublime Cadaveric Decomposition and Abysmal Torment. After the first shows the band decided to record their first album. In February 2008 Carignan entered the studio. "Mastubatorium" should be the name of the first full length CD. Slightly after the studio-work was done, Martin joined Carignan. He completed the line-up as the new bass-player. "Mastubatorium" got released via „On Parole Productions“ in February 2009, as Carignan's Debut-Album.
After the release of the Album, Carignan played more great support shows (for Visceral Grinder, Rompeprop, Putriditiy and others).
In Summer 2009, Bernhard (voc) and Martin (bass) left the band. In autumn 2009, Jean-Claude (voc) and Stefan (bass) joined the Band to complete the new line up.
