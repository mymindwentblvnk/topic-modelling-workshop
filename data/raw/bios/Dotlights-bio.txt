Dotlights is a guitarist turned laptop-producer from The Netherlands. Working out of a small homestudio in a quiet town near the german border, he uses guitars, stompbox loopmachinery and sampled instruments to create atmospheric and textural, slightly experimental pieces.

In October 2014 Dotlights released his debut EP titled qualm ep. His second album what if they're right and you're wrong was released March 2016.
