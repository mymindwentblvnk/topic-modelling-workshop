Denied 'Til Death consists of a lead guitarist and drummer. We've been playing together since autumn 2009, and great aspirations towards making this a career for both of us.
Hopefully we're able to acquire another instrument to fill out the sound, but at the moment we have no potentials.

I'm not necessarily here to work with others, but I, and the band, will accept all forms of criticism and/or suggestions that you might have. We're striving to be as best as we can, and as mentioned above, we've only been together for a short while. Hope you enjoy what we have to offer! -Chris

Experience

Chris' Experience - Played a little bit of piano during grade school years, also played in the various school bands with different instruments such as trumpet, saxophone (Alto and Tenor) and clarinet. Got interested in guitar around age 15 but never really took a liking to it. Around 18, became more interested in guitar due to hearing Zakk Wylde and became fascinated with it. Didn't start "learning" the guitar until I was about 19, but at 21 I feel like I've learned so much, and I still have so far to go.

Influences

Zakk Wylde, Children of Bodom, Kalmah, Chimiara, Shadows Fall, Paul Gilbert, Buckethead, Steve Vai, Joe Satriani, John 5, Judas Priest, Megadeth, Dave Mustaine, Metallica, Testament

Kevin's Experience - Kevin has had little to no musical background, however he has a very strong sound. Practicing for 6 hours a day for at least a year now, he has come very far, very fast. In my honest opinion, probably one of the best human metronomes on the planet, while still maintaining an awesome sense of originality.
