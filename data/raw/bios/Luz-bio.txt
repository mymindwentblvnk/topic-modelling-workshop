There is more than one artist with the name Luz.

1. Luz Casal, born November 11, 1958 at Boimorto, is a Spanish pop singer.

2. luz (ルス) is an utaite with a voice that is somewhat flat and quiet, yet uniquely emotive and expressive. He often covers songs that are emotional or slow, though will sometimes take part in uncharacteristically silly collaborations.
He started out at first on NND in July 2010 as a namahousou personality, best known for his imitations of Gintama characters Sakata Gintoki and Okita Sougo. However, since he held the occasional singing namahousou, listeners began to encourage him to expand into utaite activity, leading him to use an interface and post his first, and still most popular, cover, which was of "1925"Nv in October of 2010. It has over 73K views and nearly 3K Mylists as of March 2013.
