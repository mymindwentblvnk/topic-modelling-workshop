Almost all of the music relating to such genres as black metal, melodic death, and death metal is religious or touches on religious issues.  It is extremely common for such bands to support God or Satan in some way.  DOZ is a satirical project that supports a fictional deity - ZOLDON.  Zoldon is the God of Heavy Metal and is opposed to everything that is good and morally just.  His goal is to eradicate Peace and Happiness.  The Disciples of Zoldon are responsible for reflecting ZOLDON's musical style and proclaiming his character and intentions.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Disciples+of+Zoldon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
