Ackquille Jean Pollard (born August 4, 1994), known by his stage name Bobby Shmurda, is an American rapper from Brooklyn, signed to Epic Records. He is best known for his song "Hot Nigga", (released in July 2014) a song that debuted the "Shmoney dance," which went viral after the release of the music video. The song has so far peaked at 6 on the Billboard Hot 100, with the song being remixed and performed by numerous other artists including Lil' Kim, French Montana, Sean Mon Thomas, Juicy J, and Gunplay. On December 17, 2014, New York City Police arrested him, alleging that he was the ringleader of a Crips gang known as GS9, the same as his label, which shot indiscriminately into public crowds and murdered a member of a rival gang. Pollard was charged with for conspiracy to commit murder, weapons possession, and reckless endangerment as part of a 15-person, 69-count indictment that included his brother Javese and fellow GS9 label-mate Rowdy Rebel. Shmurda pled not guilty.

Shmurda began rapping at the age of 10. The first song he remixed was Crime Mob's "Knuck If You Buck" in 2004, but did not receive any notable attention until 2014 with the release of the song "Hot Nigga". The song features the beat from the Lloyd Banks' song "Jackpot". Shmurda gained notoriety from the video where he performs the "Shmoney dance", choreography that he made in the summer of 2013. The song became popular among Vine users and soon led to the "Shmoney dance" meme, which has since been performed by Beyonc√© on her On the Run Tour with Jay-Z, as well being used by Drake while hosting the 2014 ESPY Awards.Freestyles of the song by various rappers have since been released, including by Juicy J, French Montana, Lil' Kim, Gunplay and T.I.. The song peaked at No. 21 on the Billboard Rap Digital chart with a remix of the song featuring Chris Brown, Jadakiss and Busta Rhymes having been released in 2014. In July 2014, Shmurda performed with Meek Mill and later signed a recording deal with Epic Records. On August 29, 2014, Shmurda released a reggae remix featuring Junior Reid, Mavado, Popcaan and Jah X. On September 5, 2014, another remix of "Hot Nigga" notably featuring Chris Brown, Fabolous, Jadakiss and Busta Rhymes was released.
