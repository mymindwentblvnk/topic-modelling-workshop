Even after self releasing their debut EP (The Will That Drives Stronger Than Death) HEREAFTER AN ODYSSEY’s career is still in its early stages. With the dynamic songwriting contained on their Tribunal Records debut, Human Is As Human Does, they intend to make serious strides towards bands like Between The Buried Me and Job For A Cowboy’s current successes. Produced by Jamie King and recorded at The Basement Studios, Human Is As Human Does contains not only his trademark crushing production for a death metal record, but his skills also allow their more progressive and technical aspects to shine through. HEREAFTER AN ODYSSEY have crafted a solid slab of progressive death metal that isn’t a convenient (and now cliche) rehash of your favorite Cannibal Corpse, Obituary or Suffocation album, but more importantly a fun and refreshing step forward in the continuous evolutionary progression of heavy metal.
