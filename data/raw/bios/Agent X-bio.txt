This group is known primarily because of the vocalist Danny Simon from Jailhouse and Billy D'Vette from Pair-A-Dice.
CD ''Rock 'N' Roll Angels'' includes 6 songs of Agent X, written in 1987, part of which was produced by famed producer Kim Fowley (KISS, Runways, etc.). All the songs are excellent specimens of 80's melodic rock and will be loved by any fan of good old glam and hard rock.

2) A British record production, songwriting and DJ team, originally founded as a duo in London by Music College classmates Greg Bonnick and Leon Price, adding Hayden Chapman and Peter Renshaw to the collective in 2009. The music genres include Dance, UK Garage and Pop.

3) An underground Hip-Hop artist from Los Angeles, California.
