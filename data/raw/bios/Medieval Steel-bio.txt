Heavy Metal band from Memphis, Tennessee (USA)

In 1984, Bobby Franklin (vocals), John Ruth (guitar), Chuck Jones (guitar), Jeff Boydston (bass) and Bill Jones (drums) recorder their self-titled EP. Nowadays, "Medieval Steel" EP is a legendary release, mentioned as a great influence by many Heavy Metal bands.

After that, and with the same line-up, Medieval Steel dominated the stages from Memphis to New York, but after a while, when they were dealing with Megaforce Records, the band changed the name to Fire Choir and followed a different music direction. Even if there were recording sessions, nothing was official released and Bobby Franklin left Fire Choir to reform again Medieval Steel with Scott Jones on guitars. Songs like "Eyes Of Fire", "To Kill A King" and "Tears In The Rain", were composed that time (1985). During 1986, the band part ways with Megaforce because the development stage was very slow. After that, the line-up changed and Steve Crocker became the new bassist and Chris Cook the new drummer. With this line-up, the band stayed together until 1992 when they dissolved. All that time they kept playing live but the beginning of the 90s was a very difficult period for Heavy Metal bands in United States and Medieval Steel separate Ways.

In 2004 (20 years after the debut EP) while the band found about their underground status overseas, decided to move on again. "The Dungeon Tapes" CD was released by the band in 2005 and consists of the 1984 EP plus "Tears In The Rain" and "Lost In The City" from a demo session recorded in 1987 and new recordings of the songs "To Kill A King", "Ghost From The Battlefield", "Eyes Of Fire" from 2004. After that, silence. Until the end of 2011, when Bobby Franklin reformed Medieval Steel and in 2013 they recorded the album "Dark Castle"...
