STEELCLAD is a band whose style of Old School Heavy Metal brings the listener back to the greatest decade in Metal history...the 80's; where hammering riffs, harmonizing guitars, and the power of a vocalist's high-pitched screams could electrify an audience. Only with the release of their debut EP entitled "Descending Archangels", they have already stirred up alot of attention in their homeland of Saxony (Germany). With the support of "Enni" Haagen, promoter and booking agent for the Skullcrusher Club, STEELCLAD has been gaining alot of experience through live performances, winning Battles of the Bands, interviews, and great music reviews.

After a couple of line up changes, 
Michele Scalise "Mike Steel" ( lead singer, Guitarist and Manager ) and

2013 the recording sessions at : Volker Pöckel Studio ( Drums ) and Black Wave Studio ( Guitars,Mix and Master ) of their first album "HEAVY METAL" having behind the drums one of the most talented Italian drummer "Francesco La Rosa".
