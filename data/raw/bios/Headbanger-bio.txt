There are more artists using this name:

1) Headbanger: Considered to be one of the true pioneers of hardcore, Headbanger is one of those producers/djs that has made more hits then you can imagine. Combine true skills and a hardcore history that is completely off the scale, this one has literally done-it-all.. Started in the early nineties together with DJ Paul Elstak and Richard van Naamen the infamous group 'Holy Noise'. After various successes he went on to produce and deejay for ID&T as DJ Waxweazle. The journey continued and is simply to long to describe. More projects, more tracks and more beats were released and after this he reached that special, final level, characterized by a subtle glow: Headbanger was born and this had the unforeseen side-effect of a new spawned pseudo called Alienator. If Headbanger isnt hard or evil enough, you might be ready for this. Only for the real freaks.
