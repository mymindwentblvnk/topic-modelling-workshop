Merging from four notable metal acts in the Midwest, The Analyst quickly gained momentum and popularity throughout the world. Crossbreeding several sub-genres of extreme music into their own dynamic breed, The Analyst became known for their dark melodies, aggressive drumming, skilled guitar work, and blood curdling vocals. Through impressive recordings and energetic live performances, the band seems to be veterans of the metal genre; however, little know that The Analyst was conceived less than only three years ago. With such a strong local following, The Analyst was quickly driven to other markets in the Midwest, sharing the stage with bands such as Suicide Silence, Whitechapel, and The Devil Wears Prada not only in their home town, but hundreds of miles from home as well. The demand for new music from The Analyst landed the band a recording contract with Innerstrength Records in October of 2007. The band wrote and recorded their album, Summoning The Wretched with producer Cole Martinez (From A Second Story Window, Salt The Wound), and later released the album on May 20th, 2008. Being so well received by the public, Summoning The Wretched has allowed The Analyst to tour North America over and over again. With a newly acquired booking agent and a solidified line-up, The Analyst is ready and willing to achieve their biggest hopes and dreams. The groupâ€™s continual success has become a stepping stone toward their promising future.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Analyst">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
