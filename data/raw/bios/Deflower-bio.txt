DEFLOWER consisted of early Noir Fleurir artist. The members include TOMO (currently guitarist for RHEDORIC) as guitarist, 可憐 on guitar, KENGO on bass, 草紙 on drums and 靖 as the vocalist on the first two demos. They released three demo tapes 死セル種, 死セル蕾 and 死セル華. 靖 had left by the third demo so the entire band handled vocals for the last demo, 死セル華.

Many of the songs released on these demos where later redone and rereleased on various Noir Fleurir albums. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Deflower">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
