Originally called Disillusion, 'Premonitions Of Serenity' are a Metal band from Stafford, England.

Premonitions Of Serenity formed in April 2006, with guitarist Tim Horwath and some friends. Due to disagreement amongst band members, changes to the line up made song writing difficult. However in early 2007 Henry Churchill, offered to step in as bass player.

Also joining the current line-up is Mike Portnoy influenced Ben Creswell, drummer. His machine gun doublebass sounds and heavy blasting soon became a typical yet essential part of POS's sound.

Tim, Henry and Ben started writing immediately, the basis for "Before It Ends" was born.

In the summer of 2007, Premonitions hired another guitarist, Dan Yates, who is in the current line-up adding his own magic to the shreds and solid riffs already put into place by the band.

Premonitions Of Serenity have since took a trip to the studio in January 2008 and recorded their first demo, Kingdom Of The Dead, with hopes to record a mini-album later on in the year.

The current line-up is as follows-
Tim Horwath - Main Vocals / Guitar
Dan Yates - Guitar / Vocals
Henry Churchill - Bass
Ben Cresswell - Drums / Backing Vocals <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Premonitions+Of+Serenity">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
