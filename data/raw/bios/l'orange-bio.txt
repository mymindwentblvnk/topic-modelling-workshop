Dedicated to originality, L’Orange imbues his smoky, soul-soaked tracks with lush texture through inventive mixing and psychedelic cuts from classic radio recordings.  A shopworn MPC and vintage vinyl are essentially paintbrush and palette for L’Orange. He finds his signature samples from pre-1950s jazz, soul and radio.  He stitches together a sound that acknowledges his penchant for classic film noir and shadowy motifs.  

L’Orange albums are often cinematic and narrative in structure, exemplifying the artist’s highly conceptual creative process. While L'Orange is an inspired beatmaker and highly capable producer, it is the perpetual search for beauty in the dark, unusual and forgotten corners of music that make him a true artist.  Every L'Orange production is a unique, organic and undeniably original work of art, giving the listener a glimpse of the artist himself, even if obscured slightly by shadow.

He is from Seattle. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/L%27Orange">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
