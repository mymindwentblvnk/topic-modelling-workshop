NECROBLASPHEME is a brutal Death Metal band born in April 2001. This band was first made of members of different other groups. Christophe and Charly (guitars) were playing in Murdum (Black Death Metal), Olivier (drums) was in Domini Inferi (Black Metal), and Ryad in Catch Up (Death Metal).

Carol (bass) joined Necroblaspheme in September 2001 for the recording of the demo named “Foetal Sodomy”, then Yann (vocals) from Acrocyanose (Thrash) came to complete the line-up after the departure of Ryad in October 2001.

After few gigs, especially with bands as Sublime Cadaveric Decomposition, Aborted, Antaeus, Kaamos or Drowning, Necroblaspheme signed on the fresh new label Destructive records.

Then with this support the band recorded its first album named “Introducing Pure Violence” in November 2002.

After the release of the album, Carol left the band to be replaced by Xavier.
After few gigs and a lot of work to create new material, the band decided to record 2 fresh new songs in january 2005.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Necroblaspheme">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
