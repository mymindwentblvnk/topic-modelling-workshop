Servants Of The Immortal is a 4-piece deathmetal band, that started back in the spring of '06. Back then it was pretty much just for fun, because non of the members knew how to play an instrument. But as time went by, the guys became more and more used to play, and started making some serious music. At first it sounded horrible, but they found out really fast, how too throw down some seriously brutal deathmetal, with some nearly grinding riffs on the drums, and some really badass heavy riffs on the guitar and bass. Of course there were also some brutally bestiacil vocal to bring the death right home where it belongs; in a true deathmetal fans ears. They played their first gig in April '07, and Has banged their way into the christian metalscene in DK So hold on tight, and wait till they come visit your town. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Servants+of+the+Immortal">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
