Fatal Arrival is a four-person Classic Heavy Metal Band from Leipzig, Saxony, Germany. The band was founded in the beginning of 2012. Influenced by heros like Judas Priest, Iced Earth, Mercyful Fate/King Diamond, Iron Maiden or several underground-metal-bands Fatal Arrival keeps the classic metal spirit alive. With a combination of dark atmospheres, sentimental clean-parts, heavy riffs and a wide vocal range including high screams a widely varying but still oldschool-orientated unique Metal style is played.
