DJ Unwind is an American Producer and Remixer. As a Producer he is noted mostly for his laid-back production style of Trip-Hop which consisted of mostly record-sampling early on in his career during his time on Libyus Records in Tokyo, Japan. Since then, he has evolved as a musician and composer and continues to prove he is a musical non-conformist as he fuses several styles and genres together. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/DJ+Unwind">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
