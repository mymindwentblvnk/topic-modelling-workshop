DISRUIN started as a band in early 2009, formerly known as Exiled. The band was formed when some friends wanted to play a concert at a local talent show. They received good reviews after their first appearance, and chose to continue. Eventually, the band got several local gigs, and has since shared stage with bands such as Insense, Bloodcargo, Forgery, and Moral Diffuse.

In March 2011, they went to Strand Studio to record their first EP called "From a Sun That Never Set". The EP is recorded, mixed, mastered and co-produced by Marius Strand. All songs are produced by DISRUIN. The drawings on the cover is done by Maia Stende Nilsen, and artwork/design is done by Kristian Sandbæk Solli.



DISRUIN was chosen as "Ukas Urørt" at NRK P3 late May 2011.
