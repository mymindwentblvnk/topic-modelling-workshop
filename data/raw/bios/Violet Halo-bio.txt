Heavy metal with harsh vocals from Lohja(Finland). They are currently on hold.

The band was known as Kainin Lapset until 2000, when they changed the language of their lyrics to English and their name to Violet Vortex. However, there was a Greek band already using the name, so the band name was changed once more.

The full-length "Flora Meets Fauna" that was scheduled for 2005 was not released due to changes in the label's ownership. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Violet+Halo">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
