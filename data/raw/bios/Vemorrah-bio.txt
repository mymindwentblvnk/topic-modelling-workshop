Vemorrah was formed in mid-2004 under the name of Attaboy as a side project and bastard child of Let It Die, Never Is The Sun, and Eternal Ruin. What started off as a death/grind/metalcore/joke band out to offend people eventually turned into a more serious full-time project with their name and first line-up change in 2005. Members came and went for a while, but the core of the band (Brian, Greg and Eric) stayed true to what they wanted to do while still maintaining their uncompromisable heavy roots. In late 2006/early 2007, Dee and DJ were added to the line-up and as a whole have been bringing you your dose of mayhem ever since. Vemorrah's mission statement is simple: have a good time while playing the fucking heaviest music they possibly can. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vemorrah">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
