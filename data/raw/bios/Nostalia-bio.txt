Minnesota progressive metal/hardcore. Lead singer Grant is a history buff, which comes through in his war themed lyrics.

With trademark drum tone, prominent bass lines, and stellar guitar work, Nostalia has carved out a place of honor in the Minnesota metal and hardcore scene.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nostalia">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
