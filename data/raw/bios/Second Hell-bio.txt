After Second Hell had officially been declared dead, its former members joined other bands (for instance, Thanatos). Then, years later, Mark Staffhorst (ex-Thanatos, Virtual) felt like reviving the old Thrash Metal band and contacted drummer Gert-Jan de Bruin(Decisive Intrusion, ex-FUR). He, in turn, asked Leander Doornekamp (BaneBlade, ex-FUR) to play bass in this project. The latter anxiously agreed. For a guitarist, the founder of the band, Iron Vyron, was contacted but he could not take the time and effort for this project due to his job. Then, former member Erwin de Brouwer (also ex-Thanatos) was asked, and he willingly agreed to join forces. A singer was needed so Mark contacted Thanatos and asked Stephan Gebédi to do the vocals. At first, this was not a problem but after a while Gebédi decided it was best to quit, due to vocal problems. 
Unfortunately, Second Hell was once again without a front man. Fortunately, after rehearsing for quite some time without a singer the band contacted Aloys Smit (ex-DFDMF, Morgoth, Malfunction, and a roadie from the old days) to perform his vocal duties. He willingly agreed. However, vocal injuries struck again and after a month or two of rehearsal Aloys decided to quit. 
This, again, left the band without a front man and thus without the ability of performing. Yet, the band is now looking among themselves to see if they can combine singing with guitar playing so the direct need of a singer is postponed. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Second+Hell">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
