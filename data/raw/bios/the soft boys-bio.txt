The Soft Boys were a post-punk/neo-psychedelic band which formed in 1976 in Cambridge, England. The band's best known lineup consisted of Robyn Hitchcock (vocals, guitar), Kimberley Rew (guitar), Matthew Seligman (bass) and Morris Windsor (drums). Seligman replaced original bassist Andy Metcalfe in 1979, and two guitarists (Rob Lamb and Alan Davies) briefly preceded Rew. 

The band issued two albums, A Can of Bees (1979) and Underwater Moonlight (1980), before splitting in 1980. After band's split, Hitchcock began a solo career, and Rew formed the successful pop group Katrina and the Waves. The band has reunited on two occasions since: once for a tour in 1994, and again between 2001 and 2003. During the latter reunion, the group recorded its third album, Nextdoorland in 2002. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Soft+Boys">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
