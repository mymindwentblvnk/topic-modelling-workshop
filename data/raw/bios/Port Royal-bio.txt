(For the italian band of the same-but-different name, hyphenate the name and visit port-royal)

Port Royal is a Swedish hip hop band creating music inspired by pop, hard rock and electronica. It consists of Breki (Qliphoth) and Seb Celia (Ferdie), two young men with more ambition than talent, yet more talent than time to create music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Port+Royal">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
