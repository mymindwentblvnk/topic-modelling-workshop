Faceman is the name of multiple artists:
1) Faceman, a New York-based rapper.
2) An alias of house producer Steven DeParr.

1) Faceman was born in Queens and raised in Cypress Hills, Brooklyn. Born in 1985, Face was fortunate enough to witness hip-hop's golden era through his childhood, and listened to greats such as Big Pun, Mobb Deep, Biggie, and the Lost Boyz. In what now seems like a stale era for hip-hop, Faceman finds his influences more in the underground from artists like Immortal Technique, Necro, and the recently major Saigon. Other genres such as classic rock and heavy metal have also helped to shape Face's musical style and taste. The Cypress Hills artist uses a wide range of styles, attempting to be as original as possible, ranging from hardcore to motivational hype to political and more. He started writing by 12 years old, but started recording his own material at home by sophomore year in high school. Faceman has performed for the Diamante Show and for John Jay College. His song “Make Talk Work” is the official song of the John Jay College Make Talk Work Program in which he also earned a certificate in. Face is co-founder and former member of upcoming hip-hop group/development house Da Hillz Entertainment. Faceman has made four mixtapes released online for free download: Open Your Eyes, Lust vs. Love, The Mixtape Mixtape, and Face Mankind. He hopes to finally release a debut album and at least one mixtape in 2009. Face has also performed at Crash Mansion, Club Annex, Club Pyramid, The Spoon Theater, The Nuyorican Poets Café, The Underground Lounge, Karma Lounge, and The Link Bar in NYC.
2) Faceman was an alias of house producer Steve DeParr, used for the 1992 Nervous Records release "Love (Don't Give It Up) / Holding On". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/FaceMan">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
