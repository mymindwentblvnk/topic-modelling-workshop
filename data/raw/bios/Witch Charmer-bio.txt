Witch Charmer is a hard rockin' stoner-doom band formed in Sunderland, UK in 2012. Their sound is influenced & inspired by all that is dark, manipulative, corrupt & supernatural. Packaged into groove-laden audio journeys voicing tales of disdain and suffering about this world gone mad.


The original lineup consisted of Kate MCKeowan (Vocals), Len Lennox (Guitar & Vocals), Dave McQuillan (Drums & Vocals), Adam Clarke (Guitar & Vocals) and Davey Blackheart (Bass guitar). Davey Blackheart was replaced in October 2012, and the band brought in a new member, Richard Maher on bass guitar, who Dave & Len have worked with in previous projects; Death In Blood & The Fucking Idiots.

Witch Charmer's debut E.P. Euphoric Curse can be downloaded FREE as a 'name your price' at their offical Bandcamp website, http://witchcharmer.bandcamp.com.
