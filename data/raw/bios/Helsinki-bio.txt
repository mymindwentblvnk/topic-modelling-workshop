There is more than one artist with this name:

1. Helsinki is a Belgian, Ghent-based, band formed by Thomas Vanelslander. After being a sidekick in numerous other bands (K's Choice, Raymond vh Groenewoud, Arno, Gorki, Hannelore Bedert, ...) he decided it was time to switch to center stage. Ever since being a teenager he'd been writing guitardriven songs, focusing on energy and strong melodies. Because Helsinki is a band, he called upon Pim De Wolf (Thou, Tommigun, Lords Of Acid) to play the bass, Ace Zec (Customs, Nailpin) to bang the drums and Joos Houwen (DVKES, Statue, The Tellers) to play the guitar. And every member of the band was obligated to contribute extra vocals. A request they all happily complied with.

2. Helsinki is band/project of Babyshambles bassist Drew McConnell. Members include Jamie Morrison, Spencer Brown, Matt Park, Jonnie Fielding, Fionn Regan, Stephen 'Lord' Large and Seb Rochford. The band has played several times at the Love Music Hate Racism festival, the annual event of a cause strongly supported by Drew McConnell.

3 .Helsinki are a contemporary and experimental group. Atmospheric textures, evolving rhythms and beautiful melodies, richly entwined to satisfy the hungry pallet of the listener. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Helsinki">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
