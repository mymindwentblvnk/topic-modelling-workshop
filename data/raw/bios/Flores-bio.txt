Aaron & Lauren Flores are music leaders and songwriters who desire to see people recover their true identity in Christ.
Together they lead worship at Salvation Army Church, a ministry that is bent on helping people find freedom from addictions, hurts, and loss of hope.
The songs they sing are inspired by the amazing testimonies of the people in their church and their own journey of restoration. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/FLORES">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
