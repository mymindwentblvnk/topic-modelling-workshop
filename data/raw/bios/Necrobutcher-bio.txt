Necrobutcher was a band from Brazil formed in 1988 by Skull Detonator (bass, guitars), Sathan (drums) and Kranium  (vocals). They recorded two rehearsals before the release of their two official demos: "Schizophrenic Christianity" and "Corrosive Noise Torment". The band recorded another rehearsal after that and  decided to split up in 1990.

The members of Necrobutcher were also involved in a noisecore band called Subversive Reek Mute Perturbation and a death metal band called Wireless Helot.  

In early 2013, Nuclear War Now! Productions released a CD/Vinyl compiling all Necrobutcher's songs.
