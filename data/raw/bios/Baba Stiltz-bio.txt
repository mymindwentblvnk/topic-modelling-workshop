Baba Stiltz is a producer from Stockholm, Sweden who defies categorization. Much of his output can be classified as house, ranging from reflective, somewhat melancholy tracks to disco-influenced burners. However, he also slips into downtempo electropop, and has regularly produced beats for Swedish rapper Yung Lean. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Baba+Stiltz">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
