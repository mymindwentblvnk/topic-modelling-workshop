Riko (real name Zane Williams) is a grime MC from East London, and a long serving member of grime crew Roll Deep. He is also a part of the collective Cemetary Warriors. He was originally a drum and bass MC, starting at 15 years of age and honing his skills on pirate radio stations such as 'Pressure FM'. Riko would have been part of the transition from the disbanding of Pay As You Go to the Roll Deep Crew, but missed this pioneering time in the history of grime music through having to serve a prison sentence.

Since the 2010s and the commercial success of other Roll Deep members (e.g. Wiley and Tinchy), Riko has collaborated largely with bass music producers such as Caspa, Skream, Friction and Rabit. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Riko">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
