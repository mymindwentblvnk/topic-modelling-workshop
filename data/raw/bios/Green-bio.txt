There are many artists with the name Green:

1. A rap artist (Adam Ciesielski) from Łódź, Poland. He has released two albums, Kryptonim Monolog (2010) and Buntownicy I Lojaliści (2013).
He was in groups Phonoloftaleina and Popkiller Młode Wilki, and sometimes works under the name Greenzki.

2. A power pop band from Chicago, USA. It was formed in 80s by guitarist/singer/songwriter Jeff Lescher, whose influences included the Kinks, T. Rex, and soul music.
Although such albums as Green and Elaine MacKenzie were fairly popular in Holland, Green didn't have much exposure in their home country. White Soul marked a peak in songwriting, although it's inconsisted follow-up, The Pop Tarts, was half power pop and half grunge in an attempt to gain a wider audience.
