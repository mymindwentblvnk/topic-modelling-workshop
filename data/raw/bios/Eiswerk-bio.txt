Founded in 2007 in Bavaria, close to Munich, the three members call the projekt „Eiswerk“ into being. Based on an idea and with the large use of the members got „Eiswerk“ at that time his face. The trademark of the band are especially the clothes. With the robes and beautiful, varied views from the „Fünf-Seenland“, they created their own interpretation of music and combined it with natur and fantasy. With the thought of offering a versatile metal genre they have set this as a top priority, as well as having fun on making music.

The name "Eiswerk" was born out of a chance. As they point with their lyrics on social problems of mankind, and also on the cold, which leave the people on this world, they called the band “Eiswerk”. A good example for that are the lyrics of “Vor den Toren” or “Todesschrei”.

Important features of their songs are the catchy melodies, the growls and the hard guitar riffs. Based on many different metalgenre influences and a varied choice of instruments they have thus created their own sound.
