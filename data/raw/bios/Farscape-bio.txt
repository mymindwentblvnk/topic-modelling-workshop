Farscape is an old school thrash metal band, formed in 1998 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

Farscape (1999 â€“ 2003) is also a science fiction television series, featuring a present-day astronaut who accidentally travels through a wormhole to a distant part of the galaxy. The series is one of a new generation of popular science fiction television shows in which the main concerns are surviving in a hostile, chaotic universe and dealing with interpersonal conflicts - instead of exploration, warfare or law enforcement. It was produced by the Jim Henson Company and Hallmark Entertainment, and filmed in Australia. Drawing on Henson's traditional expertise in puppetry, two of the main characters are animatronic puppets.

The show was abruptly cancelled after it had completed production of its fourth season, with a fifth season contracted, effectively ending the series on a cliffhanger. A mini-series in 2004 wrapped up some of the show's hanging plot threads, but a feature film remains a possibility as does an animated/anime series. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Farscape">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
