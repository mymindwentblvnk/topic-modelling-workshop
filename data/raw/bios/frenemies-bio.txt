Frenemies is the nom de plume of Baltimore musician/songwriter Chris Freeland.  After Oxes went on hiatus, the drummer focused on his pop roots and gathered the talents of Steve Hefter (& Friends of Friends), Dan Franz (Arbouretum), Alex Scally (now of Beach House), and Andy Cook.  Frenemies' new record, Confider, reflects the desire to combine traditional verse/chorus pop songwriting with the low-end power and rhythmic influence of dance, rap, and punk. The record features vocals from Cass McCombs.

In an effort to promote literacy, Frenemies hosts a Free Book Exchange at every show.  The band brings along books to give out and asks fans to come with a book in hand.
