Sunnata emerged in 2013 within rising underground of Warszawa, Poland stoner rock and doom metal scene. Since then, the band proved its quality at numerous live performances at various stoner/doom/psychedelic festivals, e.g. Desertfest Berlin (Germany), Days of the Ceremony (Poland) and Robustfest (Ukraine) and shared stage with local and foreign stoner/doom acts like Sungrazer, Suma or Kylesa, just to name a few.

2014 is the year of Sunnata's long-awaited full-length album entitled Climbing the Colossus, which is an exploration of the impermanent nature of sound, full of rapid changes and distortion overdose.

The original lineup:

Szymon Ewertowski - guitar, vocal;
Adrian Gadomski - guitar, vocal;
Michał Dobrzański - bass;
Robert Ruszczyk - drums, percussion.
