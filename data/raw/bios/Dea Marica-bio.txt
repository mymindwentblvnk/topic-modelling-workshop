Dea Marica are an english doom metal band from London. The band was founded in 2012 by Riccardo Veronese (Gallow God, Aphonic Threnody) and Chris Takka (previously lined up to replace Gallow God's old drummer) and joined, during the same year, by Roberto Mura (Urna, Aphonic Threnody) and Patrick Jones. 
Dea Marica recorded and self-produced their first EP "Ritual Of The Banished" (2012). The final mastering of the EP was engineered by Optimum Mastering (the same studio that worked on the re-recording of Cathedral "Forest Of Equilibrium" in 2009) . The band's sound, still immature, collected some really good feedback: ".. an album that shows a lot of promises for the future." [Funeral Wedding] "A great band that within brief will be working on a sequel to this debut, which at the point of class and grandeur of insurance may come to fruition within the genre.." [MundoRock] "The first outing for Dea Marica is a strikingly good listen, especially potent for those True European Doom Metal purists." [Hellride] ".. it shows enormous potential for the future of this band and fans of all the doom metal sub-genres should be able to get some enjoyment out of this release...." [DoomMantia]. 
A few months later Chris and Patrick left the band due Riccardo's decision to work on a better way on the band's new material. Riccardo and Roberto, joined by Marco (Urna, Arcana Coelestia, Aphonic Threnody), started the recordings of their first full-lenght album "Curse Of The Haunted" (2013). This time, thanks to a better quality production, the band delivered a more mature album. The full-length, mixed and mastered at 322Studio by Marco, is the best Dea Marica's manifestation to date. At the gates of summer 2013 Weird Truth offered to print out the album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dea+Marica">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
