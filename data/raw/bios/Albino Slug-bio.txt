Albino Slug was formed in 1990 in Trondheim, Norway. They disbanded in 1996.  Starting out playing a mix of punk and metal, the band later evolved into a more progressive and experimental direction with the use of electronic elements, sampling and genre mixing. They released two albums on the Voices of Wonder label Metal Art Disco: Albino Slug in 1993 and Barabbas in 1994. Although not a member of the band, Hans Magnus Ryan of Motorpsycho performed with the band and played the violin on Barabbas. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Albino+Slug">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
