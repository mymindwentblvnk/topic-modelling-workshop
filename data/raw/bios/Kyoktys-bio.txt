Brutal Death Metal from Calgary, Alberta, Canada. In late 2010 KYOKTYS was formed from the ashes of two other local bands with a vision of simplified song structures and ultra low tuning while maintaining a certain level of technicality. Over the last few years KYOKTYS has toured thousands of kilometers and played a long list of festivals. 3/4 of the band has been stage crew for the notorious Noctis Festival and their bass player is also the creator of the Calgary Metal Fest.
