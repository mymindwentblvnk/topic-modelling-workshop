Wovoka Gentle (now Voka Gentle) is a British folk/acoustic trio comprising twins Imogen Mason and Ellie Mason together with William J. Stokes. Their name comes from the titles of two poems in the collection Flying Over Sonny Liston by American poet Gary Short.

“Wovoka Gentle is constantly evolving project. Our roots are in traditional soil - we love the structure and soundscape in folk songs - but we wanted to work from those foundations to develop a new vocabulary, a new kind of songwriting."

Having formed in the summer of 2014, the band wrote and performed the score for avant-garde physical theatre company Stasis' production A Table, directed by Aniela Piasecka, and went on to provide music for the world premiere of Alex Howarth’s stage adaptation of What's Eating Gilbert Grape at London’s Bridewell Theatre. Informed by such collaborations as these, the use of performance art, installations and projected visuals has made its way to the heart of Wovoka Gentle’s live shows.

Wovoka Gentle launched their first EP, Wovoka Gentle [Yellow], via Yucatan Records in July 2015 with a sold out show at London's Cecil Sharp House. Their next EP Wovoka Gentle [Blue] followed in November 2015 with a sold out show at Electrowerkz. Third EP Wovoka Gentle [Red], produced by Gareth Jones (Grizzly Bear, Depeche Mode, Interpol) was released on October 7th 2016. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wovoka+Gentle">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
