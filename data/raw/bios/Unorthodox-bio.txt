Multiple artists employ the name Unorthodox.

1. Unorthodox are an old school doom trio who have issued three albums to date and remain an active concern. Formed in Maryland, USA in the mid '80s as Asylum, the band issued several demos under that identity and built a growing reputation on the back of their live performances before aligning with well-regarded German label Hellhound Records and changing their name. Unorthodox's debut full-length "Asylum" followed in 1992 with the line-up by then consisting of stalwart Dale Flood (guitar, vocals), Ronnie Kalimon (drums) and Jeff Parsons (bass) . A sophomore effort "Balance Of Power" followed in 1995 with original Asylum memberJosh Hart stepping in on bass (after a stint with fellow D.C. area doom outfit Revelation), but this concluded Unorthodox's '90s productivity. A remastered edition of "Asylum" was issued in 2007 backed with three new Unorthodox recordings, Dale Flood having resurrected the project in the interim, and their return was further marked on September 12th 2008 by studio album number three: "Awaken" (The Church Within Records). Unorthodox's present line-up features Dale Flood (vocals, guitar), Ronnie Kalimon (drums) and Jon Blank (bass).
