Let’s take you back to 1996 where Nordafrost was founded! From this time on, they play Black/Death Metal combined with aggression, atmosphere and melodies without using any keyboards or even female vocals – just with drums, bass and one guitar. 2003 they released their demo MCD called “Dominus Frigoris” which was a success for the band. They got very good responses and reviews and this MCD is meanwhile sold out! Nordafrost hit the stage with acts like Morrigan, Anael, Goat of Mendes, Blood, Midwinter and much more. In March 2004 they recorded their first full length album called “North Arise” which was released in late July 2004 by the small german label “Heavy Horses Records”.

Both CDs were professionally recorded in the K-Sound Studio in Hagen, Germany by Matthias Klinkmann who also recorded acts like Borknagar, Angel Dust, Darth, Therion, Insignium and many many more in the past!

Meanwhile, the „Dominus Frigoris“ MCD was spread all over the world and the some hundred CDs were sold or traded! Nordafrost are also part of many international compilations, like “The reaper comes” (GER); “Witching Black” (Can) and many more! The "North Arise" album is going to be more successful than the Demo was! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nordafrost">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
