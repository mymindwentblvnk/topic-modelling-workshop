Formed in the spring of 2007, Mother Of Mercy plays contemporary metallic hardcore that draws some of the best elements of '90s HC with a well-executed tinge of metal. Their music is raw, abrasive and dark - highly influenced by Samhain, Undertow and Obituary - and a much-needed reviver of today's re-hashed "metalcore" sound. With several prior releases including the "No Eden" 7" and critically acclaimed "III" released on Six Feet Under Records (hailed as one of ScenePointBlank's "favorite records of the year,") Mother Of Mercy's Bridge Nine debut full-length "Symptoms of Existence" has just been released on January 25th, 2011 and has seen nothing but stellar reviews ever since. Be sure to catch them on the road at a show near you.
