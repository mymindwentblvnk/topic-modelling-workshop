Bulldoggs started out in 2002 with 4 longtime friends who all played since the early 90Â´s, in different bands!! Came of to a slow start with song-writing and a few gigs! The music is basicly heavy riffs and power-rock, sticks on your mind-songs! The fire increased in 2006 when the album "Never Means Maybe" was released and 2 gigs as support to NAZARETH was booked! Bulldoggs also shot a video to the opening track "Dawn" with the man behind the short film "ctrl-alt-delete", Magnus Gillberg as director.In july 2007 Bulldoggs supported The Sweet on thier one night show in Sweden!! The current state is working on new material for a follow up to "Never Means Maybe" and playing as much live as possible!!  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bulldoggs">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
