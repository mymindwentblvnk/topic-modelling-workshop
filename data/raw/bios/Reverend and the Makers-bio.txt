Reverend (aka Jon McClure) hails from the musically-renowned land of Sheffield, UK. Before this project he sang for Judan Suki and 1984 finding underground local fame and getting a name for himself. He has already collaborated with Arthur Brown, John Cooper Clarke, Tim Hampton (Bromheads Jacket), Mike Hughes (Trap2), Chris McClure, Laura Manuel (ex Judan Suki), Andy Nicholson (ex Arctic Monkeys), Tom Rowley (Milburn), and Alex Turner (Arctic Monkeys) as well as working with producer Alan Smythe. For live gigs Reverend has assembled 'The Makers', a superband of relatively unknown musicians. 

In October 2006, following extensive touring and having built up a hardcore fanbase, the band signed to Wall of Sound records. Their first single "Heavyweight Champion of the World" recieved good airplay on Radio 1 and hit the UK Top 10, and has become of this summer's anthems for many clubbers and festival goers alike, appealing to fans of both dance and indie.

Another single (He Said He Loved Me) is to be released at the end of August, alongside an album (State Of Things) in September.
