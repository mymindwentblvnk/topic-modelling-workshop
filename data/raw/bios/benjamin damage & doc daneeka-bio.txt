UK house producers Doc Daneeka and Benjamin Damage produced "Creeper" around this time last year for 50 Weapons, an eight-minute vehicle for sleek, aerodynamic riffage, an exercise in the supremacy of simplicity. Label heads Modeselektor apparently liked the single so much they commissioned a whole album from the duo and flew them out to Berlin to accomplish the task. The result is They! Live, a lean, confident long-player of stylishly minimal beats rendered in attractive curves and clear, soft tones.

Benjamin Damage is an electronic producer who lives precariously between Wales, London and Berlin.
It began with the raw energy fueled 'Maximum Carnage' mixtapes with DJ Venom, mixing up Bassline/Niche rhythms with the emerging UK Funky sound. Following this was the insanely catchy 'Deeper' for Doc Daneeka's Ten Thousand Yen label which was perhaps the true beginning of the 'Deep Rave' sound.
