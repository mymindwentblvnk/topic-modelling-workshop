The Basel based producer Audio Dope started his musical journey by making old fashioned beats inspired by the late 90s US hiphop vibes until he fell in love with the instrumental music scene and quickly established his own recipe combining organic samples and vocal fragments with crispy synths and tight drums.

His creations between hiphop, downtempo and trip-hop followed to supports for international acts such as Kaytranada, Maribou State, Gaslamp Killer or Odesza and shows at festivals like Montreux Jazz, ZÃ¼rich Openair and Openair Frauenfeld. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Audio+Dope">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
