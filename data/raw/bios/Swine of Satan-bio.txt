Satire, parody, farm black metal band from France. All instruments and vocals by Christian Farmer. 
The full length album "Battles in the Farm" is most likely a satire of George Orwell's "Animal Farm", or moreso a pun on Immortal's "Battles in the North". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Swine+Of+Satan">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
