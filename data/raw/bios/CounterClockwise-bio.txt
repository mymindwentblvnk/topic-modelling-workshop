There are two bands with this name.

1.  A punk rock band from Buffalo, NY.  Their earlier material is more ska punk and their later material grew faster and more complicated.  Members went on to be in such bands as the Pavers, Dead Hearts, True if Destroyed.  

2.  This band was started in Huntsville, Alabama where they still reside.  I'm sure he's had many other bands, but the leader of the pack, Matt Bakula started the band The Crypt Kickers, a punk rock throw in the dark before coming up with this amazing style.  Although the quality of recording may not be as rich as hoped for...for now... (he records everything himself on a travel along board) you can't beat the originality of the sound.  Ranging from bluegrass, to punk, to whatever the hell else he decides to come up with, this band also has been touring in conjunction with a group called Crash, Boom, Bang, Theatre. (http://www.crashboombangtheatre.com/) The website for the band is (http://www.thecounterclockwise.net/) which you can use to find tour dates for "The Year of the Gun Tour". You can still catch a music video promo for it created by The Dead Workers Party.

The idea is that they are performing a "live action silent film"...it's awesome! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Counterclockwise">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
