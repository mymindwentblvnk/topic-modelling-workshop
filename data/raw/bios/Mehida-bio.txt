Mehida is a melodic/progressive/power metal/rock band from Finland formed by Mikko Härkin and Jani Stefanovic in the summer of 2006. They've released two albums but have only played a couple live shows.

Out from the finnish music field rises Mehida. After several years of struggling with his musical vision, the keyboard player Mikko Härkin decided to leave his previous band Wingdom to finally accomplish the sight and sound he had been looking after for many years.

Musically the band is concentrated on bringing out the musical extremities, from difficult rhythmic sequences to unexpected modern melodic lines still keeping it all catchy and easy to listen to. Their debut album "Blood & Water", released in 2007, is a reflection of creativism which flows out from the contribution of these talented rockers. On "Blood & Water" Mehida presents over fifty minutes of energetic modern metal. The enthusiasm towards music combined with unique creativity makes Mehida a rocksolid band.

The band's stylistic scale is wide. It flows from the mathematical metal attitude prog to deep dark beautiful ballads. Raging guitars and the strong expression of the singer Thomas Vikström (ex-Candlemass) form the missing link in between the ambient synth atmospheres and precise rhytmic sects.

Their second album "The Eminent Storm" was released November 18th 2009 (in Finland) and it continues the journey into musical discoveries on the fields of emotional exploration.
