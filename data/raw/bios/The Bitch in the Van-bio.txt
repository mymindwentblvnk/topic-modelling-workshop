Somewhere in 2004 Dahner and Nydoom started a project called the Peepshow Pimps using a drumcomputer. This name was soon changed into The Bitch In The Van after they met an antisocial girl in a van who was screaming at them at the trafficlights. In 2005 Bartbaar joined on drums and Ewaus on bass and short after their joining, the first live performance was given in Geel (Belgium) at JH de Bogaard. After Ewaus left the band, Dahner took care of bass playing next to vocals. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Bitch+in+the+Van">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
