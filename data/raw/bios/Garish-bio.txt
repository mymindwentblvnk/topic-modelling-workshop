After having asserted themselves in the alternative scene inside and outside Austria's borders with their first two records "amaurose pur." and "wo die nacht erzaehlt vom tag", their third album "Absender auf Achse" gained overwhelming press and fan reaction. Despite german lyrics, it is said that their very emotional style of music is their "real language".

The band's name is an English adjective meaning dazzling, stridently colored or excessively ornamented, gaudy, ostentatious, tastelessly showy, tacky or in raucously poor taste.
