Clarence Montgomery III, better known as Playboy Tre, is an up-and-coming Southern rapper in the vein of 8Ball & MJG.  A born storyteller, Tre possess a razor sharp flow and a knack for witty rhymes on the mic.  He began to receive internet buzz after the release of his mixtape, GoodBye America, in 2008.  In early 2009, he dropped a mixtape, Liquor Store Mascot with better production values, and the official co-sign of Grand Hustle recording artist Bobby Ray (a.k.a. B.o.B.).  Tre has allegedly also received a mark of approval from none other than Oprah Winfrey, for his vivid storytelling ability on the mic.  His debut LP, title TBD, will release sometime in 2009. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Playboy+Tre">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
