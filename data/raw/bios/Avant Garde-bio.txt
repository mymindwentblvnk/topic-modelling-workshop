Also, let's not forget the duo Avant-Garde from 1968-69 which consisted of future game show host CHUCK WOOLERY and Elkin "Bubba" Fowler. They had a minor hit which hit #40 on the Billboard chart entitled Naturally Stoned in 1968 and followed it up with Fly With Me, which peaked at #130 on the U.S. Billboard chart in December 1968. Both moved on after their chart days were over. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Avant+Garde">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
