Anal Stench are a Polish Death Metal band that lyrically focuses on upon one of the most controversial forms of government in existence: Communism. While "Stench Like Six Demons" (2003) had no references to the subject, Red Revolution (2004) focused on all different Socialist subjects. This band is also noted for containing members of Thy Disease, Virgin Snatch, Decapitated (Sauron was the band's vocalist at one point), Sceptic, and Crionics. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Anal+Stench">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
