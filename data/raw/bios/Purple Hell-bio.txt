Purple Hell may refer to two bands - 

Purple Hell is a Rocford, IL based punk band fronted by Jesus Correa with Taylor Hopkins also on vocals, Spencer Scott on the keyboard, Christopher Johnson on drums, and Micky Torpedo doing bass guitar, percussion, accordion, and mellotron. According to their bandcamp 'PURPLE HELL is the musical equivalent of making bombs in your shed. Bass, drums, a little organ here and there, madmen screaming incoherently, joy and anxiety swirling together in a hurricane of all the sounds that you didn’t know you needed to hear. Irreverent, yet topically and comically serious, yet seriously comical. A purple hell is upon us and eternal damnation has never sounded so good.'  

Purple Hell (in Chinese is 紫冥) is a female fronted melodic death metal band from Beijing. They are released three disks. Their debut EP was released in 2013, and their first full-length album was out in 2014. After two years of silence, in 2016, band release a third album, called 疾人宴. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Purple+Hell">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
