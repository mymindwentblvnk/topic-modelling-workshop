Kathar is a deathrash band from Jyväskylä, Finland. In the beginning their name were Infernal God. Kathar was founded in somewhere around xmas of 2006, by Iiro Nahkamäki. Iiro decided to make a Black Metal band. He asked his friend Juho Suomi to play drums on his project. Henry Saastamoinen started singing in Kathar just a little time after that, at same time Joonas Varis joined Kathar to play bass. The style changed to thrash metal/grindcore/death metal soon.

In Debember 2007, Henry Saastamoinen left Kathar due low interest. 

They have released two demos, first demo released 8.3.2007.

Later I's intrests in metal music completely died so Kathar finally split up.
