Vargsriket have steadily emerged as one of the most respected bands in the Austrian extreme music underground. Their nihilistic, abrasive brand of Christ-Shredding Black Metal has garnered them strong reviews in the underground press and has led to various live experiences that list among some of the most potent names in extreme metal: Impaled Nazarene, Tsjuder, Dark Tranquillity, Dark Funeral, Tiamat, Siebenb√ºrgen, Eisregen, Hypocrisy, Sodom and most recently, Marduk. 

Originally founded in 1995 by guitarist/vocalist Grym and bassist/vocalist Draug, the band embarked on a temporary hiatus while the original members pursued various musical projects. When Grym and Draug decided to regroup, they recruited powerhouse drummer Tru and the trio quickly found a unique chemistry that would prove explosive. A natural progression of musical influences and interests led them to shift the focus from their melodic death/black metal roots to a more primal, aggressive Black Metal. When Vargsriket (the name is loosely translated as "Wolf's Realm") re-emerged in 2001, the response to their brand of impious CSBM was almost immediate and the band became renowned for their consistently high performance at their live appearances. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vargsriket">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
