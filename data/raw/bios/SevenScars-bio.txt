Summer 06:Tired of jamming the same covers guitarist Kevin Cummins and bassist Barry Crean longed to do something different. Soon after they decided that something fresh was needed,they were joined by lead guitarist,and long term friend Nick Connolly(who had just returned from a stint in China).
The trio applied themselves as best they could for the next couple of months to writing material,but something was amiss.The hunt for a drummer followed. After months of searching and constant disappointments the group were put in contact with a drummer whos interests were the same. Aivars a no nonsense drum machine instantly beefing up the band's sound. In July 2007 the band found a serious frontman. He comes in the shape of Paul Flynn(ex sirocco/five will die). Paul's politically driven acid-tongued lyrics have proven to be the final piece to the SevenScars puzzle.
SevenScars entered the studio in Febuary 2008 to record their first E.P. in BPM studios in Douglas, Cork entitled "In God We Rust". In support of this release SevenScars will be playing many gigs over 2008 in Ireland and plan to turn their attention to Europe and the United States from 2009 onwards. Due to their hard work and commitment SevenScars have already played with bands such as Primordial, Waylander, Thoughts of Ruin, Sirocco and Sikh(France) and Watcha (France).
