Bestiar was created in Gostyn (august 1990) by Rafal and Jacek. In winter we recorded our first demo tape "Falling deep into dementia".

We had a lot of concerts with bands like: ACID DRINKERS, QUO VADIS, BETRAYER, PANDEMONIUM, NECROFOBIC... The biggest achievement was a participation in JAROCIN '91 (Jarocin was a cult Polish Rock festival).

In 2004 Bestiar, after years of silence, is reactivated in his first line up! In june Jacek decided to leave band. Dawid Bielewicz took his place. Band have recorded a full lenght album - "Lethal Venom". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bestiar">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
