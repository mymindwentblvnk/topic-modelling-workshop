There are three known artists under the name "Cindy":

1. Mayumi Yamamoto (山本真裕美, born May 5, 1958), known solely by her stage name Cindy, was a Japanese singer-songwriter, active as a singer from 1984 to 1997 and as a songwriter from 1984 to 1998.
She is probably best known for her song "私達を信じていて", and composing multiple Number One hits for Miho Nakayama, namely "人魚姫", "Witches" and "ROSÉCOLOR".
She passed away due to cancer at the age of 42 in Los Angeles, on January 12th, 2001.

2. A pop punk group from Auckland New Zealand

3. Kai Hugo, the dutch house producer rebranded himself as Palmbomen II in 2015 and released an ace album of psychedelic acid jams on Beats In Space. He named all the tracks on that record after various minor characters from episodes of The X-Files, but one of them – ‘Cindy Savalas’ – stuck somehow. 
His next album, Memories of Cindy, filled in a fictional biography. Cindy lived in the small Californian town of Carmel Vista and died in mysterious circumstances. Hugo hired actor and model Blue LoLãn to give a face and voice to the character, and she sang on a few of the tracks – notably its blistering highlight, ‘Are You Friends with Amber?’.
Now Cindy has her own album – a pretty good, shoegaze-tinged dream pop record, recorded before the character’s ‘death’, with a loose narrative about her life, loves, and heartbreaks. LoLãn is front and centre, singing and talking on every track, breathing life into a character that has become an uncanny avatar for both LoLãn and Hugo. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cindy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
