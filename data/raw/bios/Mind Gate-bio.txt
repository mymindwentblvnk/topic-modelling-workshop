Mind Gate is a polish progressive metal band. More precisely, it's eclectic mixture of folk, jazz improvisation with a-little-bit-of blues, and of course, a great deal of heavy but progressive riffs.

The band was founded in 2000 in Katowice, Poland by Mateusz Maciejewski and Mikołaj Marcela. Since then, they recorded three demos. In 2004, they made a contract with record company Lucretia Records to release their last record, Spiral.
