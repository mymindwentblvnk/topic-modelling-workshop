Depression, anxiety, rage, desperation - all such things that come to mind when Twitching Tongues first hits a new listener. The band melds together different forms of aggressive music into an audio melancholy not heard before. The band's 2012 single, "Preacher Man", can grip and twist the listener into an emotional confusion, creating a depressive rage that may end in a bloodbath. Other dark cuts such as "Feed Your Disease" and 2011's "Sleep Therapy" are built to incite international mosh pits and for others to wallow along. The band is gearing up to release their sophomore book of hymns in the Summer of 2013 through Closed Casket Activities. The world has been warned.
