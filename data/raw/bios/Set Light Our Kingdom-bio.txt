"Another band who have been bludgeoning away at the Scottish scene for years, this young act are a breath of fresh air in an otherwise boring metal scene. Taking the tiring "deathcore" sound and giving it a more agressive yet more melodic edge, SLOK have a sound that could well last the test of time." - FIRESTORM PROMOTIONS
