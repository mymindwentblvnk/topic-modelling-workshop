Gate to Khaos is a Norwegian metal band formed in the cold dark winter of 2008. Gate to Khaos plays chaotic, aggressive, dark and brutal Norwegian metal with roots in black metal, combined with elements of thrash, death and melodic metal. It is a base of hard and fast pounding drums played with dark, evil and melodic guitar riffs and extremely heavy bass, and some of the grimmest female vocals ever growled in metal history. 


The members all have different musical backgrounds and extensive histories in various other bands, but they all share a passion for grim and brutal necrotic black metal.

-Daniel (guitar) has played in many bands ranging from metal to goth and industrial which have toured Europe several times, he is an original member of Magenta, live guitarist for Goth Minister, and is producer and live guitarist for Nebelhexe.

-Trish (drums) has played drums for several metal and hardcore punk bands including Hinsides (Sweden), she was the original drummer for Skitliv, and currently plays live drums for Nattefrost. She also has her own blackmetal-punk solo project called DödsÄngel.

-Hans Petter (bass) has played in a number of Norwegian metal and punk bands since 1985, too many to name.

-Ida (vocals) has been a member of the Oslo metal scene since the 90’s and was the former vocalist of Norwegian rock band Imago.


Gate to Khaos has played several live shows in Oslo with a number of both local and international bands and have built up a local fan base. They are hoping to expand and tour internationally and play European festivals in the future. Their live show includes a lot of blood, chains and corpse paint based around a theme of insanity, decay, chaos, death and destruction.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gate+To+Khaos">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
