Robin, aka. Uplifted, is a 19-year-old mashup artist from New York City, best known for his electrodub hit “I Like Turtles.” He began seriously experimenting with basic remixing and production tools during the summer of 2011, through Logic Pro and Traktor. Within weeks he put forth a series of feature-length progressive house and trance mixes; shortly afterwards he incorporat...ed electrohouse and dubstep. Lest you forget, Uplifted is also an adjective that contains three syllables and three vowels.

Robin is currently a sophomore studying Business, Entertainment, Music and Technology at New York University, and a graduate of the highly pretentious Phillips Exeter Academy. Since he has no friends in real life, he enjoys video chatting with internet strangers who swear that they have candy, and strongly encourages that you do the same. More importantly, he spends his free time not caring, not smiling, and being sarcastic. As a matter of fact, he hates turtles. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Uplifted">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
