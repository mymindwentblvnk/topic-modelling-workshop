Smohalla is a post-black metal band from France. Formed in 2006, the band plays a kind of music which, between violence and ambient, is based on progressive structures. Smohalla combine influences from the mid-90s black/death scene with a personal conception of music and a modern touch.

They recorded a first demo entitled "Smolensk Combustion". The lyrics revolve around the way vanity, fear and paranoia have destroyed the only things human beings could really possess: our serenity and our ancient dreams. Now visions of cities on fire, religious holocaust and other modern diseases are the only thoughts passing through our minds when we are awake. With Smohalla, the Father of the Dreamers, as an emblem, the band creates a personal world in which fantastic landscapes materialize beyond our imagination, thus opening a gate between oniric infinity and the cold reality. 

They have also released a MCD on God Is Myth records entitled "Nova Persei", based on the HP Lovecraft's novel "Beyond The Wall Of Sleep." They've signed on Vendlus Records for the future releases, and God Is Myth will also re-release "Smolensk Combustion".
