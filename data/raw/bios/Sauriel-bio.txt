In October of 2007, Gregg Harvey (ex-Inflicted) met up with his long time friend John Dellicicchi after many years, and decided to start a black/death metal project together. Years go by of frustrations and coming and going of members. Only after recruiting the madman guitarist Loki from the recently split thrash band, The Accursed, do they come across drummer Allan Benoit in February of 2009 and finally form the core of the band. But after some time passes, Loki has to retreat from the band due to personal reasons, leaving only Gregg, John and Allan looking for a second guitarist and lead vocalist. With 3 songs done and ready for vocals, and guitar extras they were on the hunt for the last 2 pieces of this puzzle, and as luck would have it, the melodic death band Withered Sun had just broken up and left vocalist Jonathan Helme (ex-The Accursed as well), and guitarist Rob Schweitzer without a band. After showing interest in the band, they asked Jonathan to join on vocals, then Rob to hit the 6 strings. Coming together the band was formed in November of 2009. Being nameless for all of this time together, it was time to breath new life into the band. The name game was tough goings for the band. Name after name was taken, or was to clich√©. Coming up with Sauriel, was a stroke of luck in itself, (the members of the band actually read books). With a new name, a full line up and songs like Horns Ov War, Ritualistic Circles and Master Ov Aeonic Fire, Sauriel will be a blackened death metal force to be reckoned with.
