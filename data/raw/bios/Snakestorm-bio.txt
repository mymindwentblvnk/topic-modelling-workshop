Cowbells and a singer frothing at the mouth, three packs a day at least, tumbleweed flying around and a chupacabra sucking the blood of goats. Ridden with disease, balls to a brick wall and shredding guitars to accentuate the shit storm stemming from the nuclear bass and pounding drums. 

Tapping from the well that fed Judas Priest, Accept and possibly even old Metallica, this loud quartet from Sweden have begun to spread like nuicance but it's a good thing. Whether you like your rock and roll with an extra nut or not, the chance of you banging your head to the sound of a fucking SnakeStorm is far too great to imagine on a rainy day.
