HABLOT BROWN IS A FRESH NEO-SOUL/R&B BAND WITH A UNIQUE SONIC POLISH.
Formerly known as Linus Hablot, Hablot Brown is comprised of Linus Lester-Hodges, Austin Brown, & John Brown who together form a fresh neo-soul/R&B band with a unique sonic polish.
Bringing an interesting blend of vastly contrasting genres, the band borrows from musical influences such as Nick Hakim, Ned Doheny, & J.Dilla creating their own unique sound that is difficult not to fall in love with.

In their first 12 months of releasing music, Hablot Brown was streamed over 7.7 million times on Spotify, in addition to being featured on playlists like Global Viral 50, Fresh Finds, Sweet Soul Sunday, Alternative R&B, & Sin Estres.
The band just released their sophomore EP with Soulection and are gearing up to release three music videos along with several singles before the first of 2019. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hablot+Brown">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
