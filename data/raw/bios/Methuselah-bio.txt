Methuselah, being a Biblical name, has been used by numerous artists.

(1) Methuselah evolved out of the previous bands The Dimples and Gospel Garden. John Gladwin was the main songwriter and lead singer, and he was joined by Craig Austin (bass, vocals), Mick Bradley (drums), Les Nicol (guitar, vocals), and Terry Wincott (guitar, vocals). The band recorded two albums worth of material for Elektra, one of them a double, but nothing was released until the self-titled single LP in 1969, by which time the band had already split up. Bradley went on to play with Steamhammer; Gladwin and Wincott formed Amazing Blondel.

(2) Methuselah is a 21 year-old electronic beat maker, residing in Halifax, NS.

'Hailing from the east coast of Canada, the artist created his ‘Methuselah’ moniker as a personal project to achieve a beat-oriented sound that is both notoriously powerful, yet imbued with fragility and delicate tones. Laden with field recordings and his own bastardized synth patches, Methuselah’s music attempts to transport you to an out-of-focus dream world of hazy, emotional bliss.'

(3) Methuselah is an evil influenced black metal project, with members unknown currently and one demo release as of 2012.  http://www.mediafire.com/?0bg5tr69bllpvnb <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Methuselah">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
