There are several things called SR.

SR (1) SR (formerly Stabber[2]) is a British rapper and songwriter that went viral for his single "Welcome to Brixton" in 2020.[1][3] His follow-up song, "Practice Makes Perfect", was named in the top 10 songs to come out of the U.K. by DJBooth in May of 2021.[


[b]SR (2) is the acronym for Sveriges Radio (the Swedish national broadcasting company).

SR (3) is Stefaaans demos - mainly hardcore/punk.
At the moment the recordings are very low budget as I'm using: a cheap low quality microphone, guitar, and a small practice amp. Most songs are written and recorded in less than an hour and are roughly 20-30 seconds long. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/SR">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
