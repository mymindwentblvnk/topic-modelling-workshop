Oxymor was created in October 2004 but its present organisation was setup in June 2006. At the beginning, the group used to play melodic black metal which was rather brutal, with some melodic moments (with piano and cello). Then, with all the different compositions, these instruments got more and more important in violent riffs. After that, our pieces became more homogeneous, with less quiet moments and less brutal moments. It became punchier.

In September 2006, the group decided to record its first “demo” in a studio. It was made of 10 titles that were related to each other by a common story. We went to a studio on December 27th and 28th. Each track was recorded live, without any metronomes. When a recording was chosen, we didn’t change it. Therefore, this demo is faithful to the way our group plays live. We finished the CD at the beginning of January 2007 and at the same time, different websites were created www.oxymor.fr and www.myspace.com/oxymor.

We started dealing our demo in bars and on the internet so that we could get different opinions about our music. We received very positive answers, especially on www.lefantastique.net where people commented on our demo. This recording also helped us to play at the third edition of “Dark-fest”, a metal festival in Cambrai. It also helped us to find several dates for concerts, for instance in Tournai (Belgium).

But the group would like to perform more often on stage and to be known by a larger audience. That’s why we have decided to get in touch with a label, and we hope to be able to promote our music more seriously. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Oxymor">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
