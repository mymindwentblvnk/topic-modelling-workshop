West London’s Matilda Mann has already lived out a few dreams. Armed with a voice made for John Lewis Christmas adverts and a handful of low-key bops, Matilda is on the up. Her latest EP ‘Sonder’ was written in the thick of the pandemic and imagines a better world. At only 21 years old, she’s got the lyrical sensibilities of someone far older, thanks to her curious nature and drive to pursue music since she was a child.

Matilda achieved a life goal by supporting Arlo Parks, Beabadoobee and The Staves on tour – who, alongside Laura Marling, were her initial musical inspirations. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Matilda+Mann">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
