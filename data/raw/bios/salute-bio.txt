2) Salute is a Heavy/Sleaze/Thrash Metal band that formed in  Bristol (UK) in 2004. The band initially released an EP, called "Break-Neck Speed Triumph" (2005), without label support.

In 2009 the band moved over to the German underground metal/thrash specialist label Witches Brew and released the second album "The Underground" the same year. This record broke new ground for the band, who now play Black/Crust Metal.
