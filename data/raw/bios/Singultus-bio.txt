Singultus was formed in 2005 as an anonymous, one-man, raw depressive black metal project from Lancashire, England. It exists only as a monument to its creator's disdain for the worthlessness of humanity and existence. Whilst technically together from winter late 2005 - autumn 2009, Singultus only released one demo, 'Fearful Be, Lest Existence is Further Endured' in winter early 2007 (limited to 100 copies); as well as contributing a cover of 'The Twilight Fade' on the Thergothon tribute album, 'The Rising of Yog-Sothoth'.

A full-length LP — including re-recordings of the demo — was partially recorded but never released (and eventually lost) due to the deteriorating mental state and erratic life situation of the individual behind the project.

• Despite last.fm's listing as the band being active; Singultus is most definitely defunct and will not be returning... at least not under the same name. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Singultus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
