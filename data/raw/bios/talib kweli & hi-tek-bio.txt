Lyrical prodigy Talib Kweli and extraordinary underground hip-hop producer DJ Hi-Tek comprise Reflection Eternal. Kweli -- whose name literally means "seeker of truth" -- also owns a small bookstore in Brooklyn and is more than just an average MC, being also a key to the Mos Def collaborational LP Black Star. He first met Hi-Tek in 1994 while visiting Cincinnati, and appeared on a track from Hi-Tek's group Mood After Reflection Eternal's inception in 1997, the pair were signed to indie powerhouse Rawkus Records, where they released their first single "Fortified Live" b/w the indie sensation "2000 Seasons." The best way to describe Talib Kweli is as an erudite wordsmith prodigy; he incorporates political issues, complex metaphors, vivid imagery, a braggadocio rhyme style, and an overall charisma into his precise lyrical presentation. Although Reflection Eternal is an "underground" hip hop group in principal, the relevance of Kweli's lyrics and the resonance of Hi-Tek's production propelled them to the forefront of quality hip-hop. Reflection Eternal was also featured on Mos Def's album Black on Both Sides, as well as the anti establishment opus album entitled The Unbound Project. The duo's self-titled debut LP was actually filed under the name of Talib Kweli & DJ Hi-Tek. ~ Nick Pfeiffer, All Music Guide <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Talib+Kweli+&+Hi-Tek">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
