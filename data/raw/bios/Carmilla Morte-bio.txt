The band formed in 2005 when a couple of young music students decided to form a project, focused in the Gothic Progressive Metal, which bases in the virtuosity of its members and focusing in a different musical gender.

The band goes through the progressive style with songs that have a general structure which cover a melodic part where the voice has so much strength and an instrumental part based on standout virtuosity.

The gothic ideology bases on the “vampirism” and precisely in the Italian tale by Sheridan Le Fanu: ''Carmilla'', from where the name is taken: “Carmilla Morte”. That is why the lyrics and the expression in live performances are oriented to make allusion to these vampire tales.

In 2006 the band recorded their first promotional demo album with the song: “Funebre Leyenda” where we can see clearly the style developed.

During 2007 the band recorded their first album called: “Svegliare di Carmilla”, which translates as “Carmilla’s awaken”, making allusion to the band birth. This album shows clearly the style of the band and what is planned to keep on doing.

In 2008 the band plans to record their second album: “Morte di Vampiria”, this album is more complicated and blends many other styles like the latin folk rhythms, jazz, etc. In this time Carmilla’s tale will be recounted throughout the entire album, to create a continuous dark environment in the extent of the production.
