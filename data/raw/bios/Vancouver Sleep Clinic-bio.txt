Australia's Vancouver Sleep Clinic is the solo project of ambient, electronic singer/songwriter Tim Bettinson. Born in 1996, Bettinson grew up in Brisbane listening to his father's classic Fleetwood Mac and Eagles records before discovering more modern artists like Bon Iver and Sigur Ros in his teens. Inspired, he began writing his own songs, recording with a keyboard and computer.

In 2013, he uploaded the song "Vapour" online, where it caught on, drawing thousands of plays.

A follow-up EP, Winter, also garnered considerable attention and by 2014, Bettinson had begun playing live shows, including making an appearance at Austin's SXSW festival.

In 2016, Bettinson released Vancouver Sleep Clinic's full-length debut, Revival, on Sony. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vancouver+Sleep+Clinic">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
