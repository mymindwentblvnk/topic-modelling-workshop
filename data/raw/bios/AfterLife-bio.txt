There are many bands/artists named Afterlife:

1) Nu metal band from Florida, US.  
Signed to Hopeless Records, debut album Breaking Point released January 2019.

2) Steve Miller is the writer / producer / remixer behind the blissful beach grooves of Afterlife. This album is the natural progression from working with a number of major artists including K-Klass,  Karl Pitterson and Jose Padilla and having tracks included on the Cafe Del Mar series. 

When thinking Balearic, there is a name that should strike you right away. No, not Ibiza itself, but the man responsible for producing and curating some of the lushest sunset music the White Island has ever heard – Steve Miller, perhaps most commonly known as Afterlife. Making a name for himself in the early 2000’s by playing monumental events such as Glastonbury, headlining Cafe Del Mar’s 20th anniversary party and reaching the top of the UK charts by remixing Another Chance from Roger Sanchez, he’s managed a consistency unlike many others in the decade and a half since.These days he's creating some of the most imaginative electronic music and supported by the top electronic music curators worldwide including Nemone and Trevor Fung.

3) Afterlife is a death metal band from Mishawaka, Indiana. Formed in 1990. Split up in the 90's but recently reformed.

4) Posthardcore/crust band from Nechyba (CZ) Afterlife is based on friendship and passion. This band strictly disapproves with all acts of intolerance, discrimination and violence.

8) AFTERLIFE, a progressive/alternative rock trio formed in January 1986 in Carrollton, GA by Mike Hudson, Jonathan Dorsey and Warren Davis.

This "AFTERLIFE" is the oldest band using the name that I've been able to determine.  The band took a 20 year break between the 3rd and 4th album, but regrouped in 2011 to begin recording "Compass Rose".  As of this writing no live shows are planned, but songs are currently being written and hopefully the band can enter the studio once again to record album number 5.
