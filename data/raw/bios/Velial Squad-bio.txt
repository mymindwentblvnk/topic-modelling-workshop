Velial Squad (styled as VELIAL SQUAD) is a Russian horror- group based in Tula. One of the most prominent features of the group is the custom balaclava they wear, which they have always worn infront of fans, meaning their real identity is still unknown. As the names of the participants are not known, they are called simply “black” and “white”, in relation to the color of their masks. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/VELIAL+SQUAD">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
