Together since 2007, Diamond Dust just released their debut album on June 21, 2011. The group reminds one of peak period Led Zeppelin in their ability to dish out both blistering, full-bore rock, and lively, foot-stomping folk. The band lives and shares the same love of real music that the performers of Woodstock â€˜69 and that romantic era did. Their sound is new and refreshing yet still has that familiar rock n' roll feel. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Diamond+Dust">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
