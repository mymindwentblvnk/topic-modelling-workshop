Mass Murder Messiah came into existence in 2009 with a burning will to lead the metal scene with a sound that is unquestionably their own. Often labeled Rockcore, their blend of thrashy, technical riffs and slamming breakdowns evoke the best of both Quebec’s long-established death metal scene and New England’s distinctive brand of throwback hardcore. The members of Mass Murder Messiah are longtime members of some of Montreal’s finest, as Jef (guitar) is a part of the legendary thrash outfit Anonymus, while Bizier (bass) plays in Reanimator and Vince (guitar) hails from the defunct Bloodstained Memory and Incision, of which J-M (vocals) and Sammoth (drums) were founding members. It’s the band’s eagerness to blend these deep-rooted local influences and their old-school influences, including seminal acts ranging from Hatebreed and Meshuggah to Gorguts and AC/DC, that has positioned them at the ideal rock/hardcore/metal crossroads.

Since their formation, the future has looked brighter and brighter for Mass Murder Messiah. Their perfect combination of brutal metallic riffs, heartfelt vocals, and vicious mosh parts, are all crucial components of their upcoming self-titled album, available for free downloading February 2011. This release is a declaration of brutal insurgence and gives listeners a strong sense of where the band stands ,and will stand, in metal’s long-lasting history. It is sure to touch a wide audience and guarantees them a spot as the band to watch for this generation. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/MASS+MURDER+MESSIAH">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
