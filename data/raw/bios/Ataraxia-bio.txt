There are multiple artists named Ataraxia:

1) Ataraxia was a pseudonym used by experimental electronic musician Mort Garson only on his 1975 album "The Unexplained: Electronic Musical Impressions of the Occult".

2) Ataraxia, formed in 1985, is a neofolk / neoclassical band from Modena and Reggio Emilia, Italy, that combines modern technology with archaic instrumentation over various media. They describe their music as a cross "between sacred and profane, ethereal and neoclassic, contemporary and early music." Their work has often involved research into European legends and Classical mythology. Contemplation, dreamy experiences, elegiac atmospheres, ritual movements float in a mysterious garden where contemporary textures of notes meet the embracing echo of classic sounds. Their lyrics are written in many ancient and contemporary languages (such as Latin, French, German, English, and their native Italian) as they try to bring to the surface the hidden treasures and revelations of each. Many of their performances take place in locations the band professes to possess specific spiritual qualities.  Since their beginnings in the late 1980s, they have recorded over 20 original LPs every one presenting its own original concept. To name just a few, La Malédiction d'Ondine (1995) deals with female spirits of water and earth; while “Llyr” (2010)  tells the story of a divine being traveling through times and forms. Their last work Quasar (2020) is dedicated to 7 archangelic archetypes.

Some of their earlier long sold-out albums have been recently re-released with numerous bonus-tracks.
