Void Seeker were born in March 2013 from an idea of Stefano Vianello (former Räjähdys), Enrico Pellegrini (ODR - former Räjähdys), Enrico Mandarano (former Räjähdys), Andrea Racco (former Räjähdys - Opening Scenery - Etherna) and Andrea "Criogena" Garrone, with the aim to set up a new Power Metal band. 
During the following months, due to personal necessities and the need of new musical adventures, both Enrico Mandarano and Andrea Racco leave the band in amicable way. 
In that moment Enrico, Stefano and Criogena take the lead, more than ever determined to keep this project alive and, in the weeks that followed, Andrea Rodella (Innerhate) and Federico Matarazzo (Moonrage) join the band, on guitar and voice respectively. 
As the circle closes, synergy can start! 
Void Seeker move on the border between power and death metal thanks to each individual strong influences which, despite being definitely diverse, leave space to the members to express, and generated in time a strong synergy among them. 
After the first gigs and the first demo recordings, in 2015 Void Seeker give birth to their first EP "Scarlet Eyes", a 3 pieces-mini concept which sees the participation of Matteo Spada (Opening Scenery) and Monica Primo (My Black Light) as guests on the 2nd song, "Lost Desire". 
The concept developes through 3 songs, telling the story of a woman condemned for withcraft who, as a result of the combined action of fear and unconditioned hatred from her accusers, will reveal her true nature. The idea behind is to illustrate how feelings can deeply affect people's nature, slowly transforming them in the very same monsters society fears. 
Nowadays, Void Seeker are busy writing their first album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Void+Seeker">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
