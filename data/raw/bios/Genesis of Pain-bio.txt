The band formed when the two other members of Shubend left. At the same time the remaining three members moved out to different places of Sweden, but decided to keep it as a studio project directed by band leader Dan Lundberg. In fact Shubend was mostly a studio band towards the end. The project was discontinued in February 2007.

The  Shubend release 'Synergism' was also released as 'Synergism 2.0' under the Genesis of Pain moniker. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Genesis+Of+Pain">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
