Ex Animis Mortuum was formed in 2007 with John Hall on guitar, Eric Nguyen doing Vocals, Evan Hall on Bass, and Justin Reynolds on Drums. Without originally having a clear definition of what genre, Ex Animis Mortuum eventually fell primarily into Death metal yet also has significant influences from black metal.

In 2008, various events lead to a lineup change in which a new drummer and vocalist were added. Following soon after this, the first official EP, was released with all new lyrics and song titles for the old songs.

Currently we have released the mp3s from our EP, From The Souls of the Dead, for free download, the following link will allow you to download it: http://www.mediafire.com/?y2oza2z32vw . In addition to this we are primarily focusing on writing new material to be released on our first full length album.
