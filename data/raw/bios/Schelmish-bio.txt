Schelmish was a German Mittelalter rock band from the city of Bonn, Germany. The band originally formed in 1999 for a birthday celebration for band member Des Demonia's mother. The language of their songs varies between German, English, Latin, French and several old languages. The band split-up in December 2012; a group of members founded the Electro Folk Rock Band InVictus.

They can often be seen performing at local Medieval Markets and other re-enacting events.
In contrast with other 'medieval' bands, which often restrict themselves to a few instruments like bagpipes and drums or similar combinations, Schelmish offers a big pallette of instrumentation and mix them in a proper way. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Schelmish">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
