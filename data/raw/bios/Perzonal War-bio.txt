PERZONAL WAR is a power/thrash metal band from Troisdorf (NRW), Germany. The band was founded by Matthias Zimmer (vocals & guitar), Martin Buchwalter (drums), Sascha Kerschgens (guitar) and Frank Buchwalter (bass) in 1996. After a couple of demo releases the band recorded their first album "The Inside" in 1998 which got very good reviews in the magazines all over Europe.

In the beginning of 2000, the band recorded their second album "NewtimeChaos". The album was released in May 2000 with the label "B.Mind Records". In March 2002, Personal War changed the name from "Personal War" to "Perzonal War" because of legal reasons and signed a deal with AFM-Records.

In July 2002 the 3rd album "Different But The Same" was released worldwide over AFM Records. Also Victor Smolski from RAGE played a couple of guitar solos on the album and helped the band in the studio. The album got amazing reviews and lots of high soundcheck positions in the important Metal Magazines.

After lots of live gigs and Festivals (a.o. on the Sziget Festival in Budapest, as support for RAGE and NEVERMORE) bass player Frank Buchwalter split with the band in January 2003. In June 2003, Perzonal War entered the studio again to begin with the work on the album "Faces". During the recordings, bass player Sven Krautkraemer joined the band and completed the strongest Perzonal War line up so far.

The band also recorded a video for the single "My Secret" with a very popular German film team. After that the band played a very successful Tour together with "Circle to Circle" and "Blaze". "Faces" is the band´s strongest release so far and the very high soundcheck positions (Rock Hard Germany 10 x dynamite, Metal Hammer Germany Soundcheck position 7 etc.) and also the entry in the german Metal-DJ Charts at position 10 speak for themselves. The Clip to "My Secret" is shown in whole Europe and especially in Holland it runs 10 times a day in "High rotation" on "The Box".
