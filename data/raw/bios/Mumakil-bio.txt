Mumakil did officially exist between 2004 and 2017. Four Geneva, Switzerland grind freaks decided to create a new war machine. Jéjé (guitar, former Nostromo member) and Taverne (bass, former Knut member) were motivated to to play together a crushing and destroying grindcore - the idea was to play a really brutal and blasting death/grind in the vein of Terrorizer, Brutal Truth etc. Then Thomas (vocals) and Seb (drums) joined the crew. They released the first album yet - Customized Warfare. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mumakil">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
