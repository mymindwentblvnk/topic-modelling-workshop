The origins of Elficus is Joliette where Eric and Simon started to play together in 1997 in a band named Revive, with another bass player and a female singer. Then, Etienne joined the band as a second guitarist in 1999. At this time, their style was not into metal but rather a kind of alternative-rock. They recorded a demo under the name of Revive at that time. Their academic occupations and the fact that Simon was in Montreal, prevented them from progressing during nearly two years. Then Eric and Etienne moved to Montreal too and it became difficult to practise with their former bass player. Their music has gradually moved to metal then in 2002 Etienne met Christian at the university who proved to be the ideal bass player to join them and they took the name Elficus. After having tested three female singers, they finally found Jean-Rene in 2005 to complete the band.
