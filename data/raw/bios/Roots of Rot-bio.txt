Mexican death metal formed in 2002 when Jose and Alfonso break up with Anton and join with Saimon and decide to make an extreme metal band with another kind of philosophy and words in english. 
With a demo in their backs ("The Rotten Path") some doors were opened and the band sign with American Line Prods for two albums. 

The first came in 2004 called "HATED FLESH" with a lot of good reviews (and something no too goods, haha) But the machine is turn on, and marching on. The rotten squad have made several presentations in different cities by more than two years and the rotten legions are growing. In 2009 Roots of Rot suffer changes of members and join to the squad Ulises Chopper from the Brutal Death Metal band Evil Entourage, with this powerfull lineup Roots start to playing a lot into the local and nationals gigs. Roots of Rot are in this moment of 2009 working fiercely for the next album.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Roots+Of+Rot">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
