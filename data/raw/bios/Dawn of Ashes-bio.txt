Dawn of Ashes is an American aggrotech / extreme metal band founded in 2000 from Los Angeles, California, United States. The band's style consists of horror-based lyrical and visual themes presented through industrial and melodic black metal structures.

Kristof Bathory ended Dawn of Ashes in 2014. The three remaining members moved on to a new project named Urilia.

The name Dawn of Ashes is an allegorical metaphor meaning "beginning of the end."

Dawn of Ashes reformed in December 2015.
