Formed in 1988, The Almighty are a rock band, from Glasgow Scotland.

The band's music veered between punk and hard rock on albums including 1989's debut 'Blood Fire and Love', 'Soul Destruction (produced by Duran Duran guitarist Andy Taylor),' 'Powertrippin' (which saw Tantrum leave and be replaced by Pete Friesen of Alice Cooper), 'Crank' and 'Just Add Life.' During this time, the band played the Monsters of Rock festival in Donington, England, in 1992 and also played with Metallica at the Milton Keynes Bowl. The Almighty split up in 1996.

In 2000 the band reformed with Nick Parsons on guitar. A second album shortly followed in 2001, Psycho-Narco, with a new bass player Gav Gray replacing long time bassist Floyd London. The band soon disbanded again with vocalist Ricky Warwick pursuing a solo career.

By mid-2005 bassist Floyd London had won an unpublicised fight against Lukemia which brought the band together to play once again. The classic lineup reformed for two Lukemia Research benefit shows in January 2006, which was followed by a Headline appearance at the 2006 Bulldog Bash, then a short 5-date tour at the end of December 2006.

In February 2007 a Greatest Hits CD/DVD Anthology: The Gospel According To... was released with the full support of the band, this was followed in July 2007 with a live DVD of the Glasgow Lukemia Research show from January 2006.

The band have 'left the door open' to the possibility of future shows and recording new material.

In 2010 Ricky Warwick joined Thin Lizzy (renamed to Black Star Riders in 2012).
