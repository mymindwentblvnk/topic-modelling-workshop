Obligatorisk Tortyr is a trio playing music based on grindcore, but drawing inspiration from many styles of music. Jens (Guitar/Voice) and Viktor (Bass/Voice) founded the band back in 98, together with drummer Fredrik. After releasing their full length debut on Osmose Records Fredrik split in 2001. An unsuccessful search for drummers left the band more or less defunct. In 2004 Stefan Karlsson volunteered to take the drum position. Despite the fact he's a guitarist he managed to pick up the grind in no time. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Obligatorisk+Tortyr">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
