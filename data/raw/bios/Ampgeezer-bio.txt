This band does not longer exist... RIP The band started rehearsing in mid november 2003. The first demo was recorded in April 2004 and was received quite well. The idea is to mix metal, stoner and hard rock into something interesting.

Discography:

Searching beyond the desert part I
(2004-04-XX)

1 Graveyard junkie
2 Voices
3 Wasted years
4 Personal hell)

(These songs have more of a stoner rock-vibe to them.)

We have just recently recorded a new demo. A bit heavier and hopefully better produced than the last one.
