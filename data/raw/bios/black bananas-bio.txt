"Jennifer Herrema and her funky bunch conjure a sheer wack attack under the all-new, all righteous tag Black Bananas. This isn't your father's Trux or your mother's RTX â€” Black Bananas is a new movement, and move it does, with a springy step and and hip-bounce as part of the high-flying energy. Rad Times is right, and to the max is but the one way!"
