Ann Arbor's latest prodigal son and lover of sprinkles on doughnuts, takes the legacy of all Detroit's talented musical sons and daughters and makes Hip Hop beats filled with snippets of Soul, Funk, 70's Italian horror flick soundtracks, Nintendo bonus level music, and 90's Hip Hop. Somehow, with this much content, the beats still manage to sound gloriously minimal and disjointed. Fans like Benji B, Andrew Meza and XLR8R have been eagerly snapping up his tracks, as Sam freeze frames Electro energy and spits it back out as twisted future Jazz. Daedelus describes him as "a thrilling sound to break the sameness," and Flying Lotus is his brother in arms (they collaborate on the project FLYamSAM).
