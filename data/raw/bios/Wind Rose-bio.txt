Wind Rose is an Italian metal band. Its music style varied from progressive metal on early albums to folk metal on the latest, while also featuring symphonic power metal influence. The band's lyrics are inspired by fantasy fiction, with especial emphasis on mythological dwarves.

The name "Wind Rose" was chosen by Claudio, Daniele and Federico, the founding members of the band. They started practicing together in 2007 as a Dream Theater, Symphony X and Blind Guardian cover band, playing in a lot of live shows.

When Francesco and Alessio became part of the band in 2009, Wind Rose started to write their own material: a progressive and epic one. Their first EP was released in 2010 under the care of Cristiano Bertocchi (Vision Divine, Labyrinth) having a lot of good reviews (here you can find them!). The epic success that the EP's tracks had made Wind Rose write a full-lenght album, again under Cristiano's artistic production. The album is available since 28th, August 2012 via Bakerteam Records and it will be named "Shadows over Lothadruin", based on a fantasy story written by Claudio.
