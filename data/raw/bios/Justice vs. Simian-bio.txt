The 2006 single "We are your friends" is a remix of the English electro-rock band Simian's older hit "Never be alone" done by Simian and the French electro house band Justice, thus credited Justice vs. Simian.

The video for "We Are Your Friends" features people having being set up whilst in their drunken sleep at the end of a party. The first part of the video shows the people sleeping in the complex contraptions of objects that have been set up around them. The second part starts when they all wake up suddenly and the tower of household items collapses below them.
