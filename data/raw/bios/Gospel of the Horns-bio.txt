Gospel of the Horns formed in Brisbane, Australia, in 1993 and in late '94 they released their cult demo The Satanist's Dream. It gathered great responses, which in turn led to a deal with the incompetent Einstand Records [Italy] to press the demo on CD. Not only was the layout incorrect, they also placed a photo of a different band in the booklet... To this day, the band urge no-one to purchase this CD as this label does not warrant your money.
 
After Gospel of the Horns split in 1996, Howitzer moved to Melbourne where he teamed up with Destroyer 666, playing drums for the Unchain the Wolves album. During this period, Howitzer was seeking adequate heathens to reform Gospel of the Horns.
 
They finally emerged in June 1997 with Marauder [who at the time was rehersing with Bestial Warlust] taking over the guitar duties, with Warhammer on drums. Their second demo Sinners was recorded in May '98, once again selling well and gaining extremely positive reviews. After much consideration, the band decided to sign a deal with Damnation Records [Holland], consisting of one mini-LP followed by a full-length CD/LP.
 
In November '98, B. M. Obliterator replaced Warhammer on drums and Gospel of the Horns did a deal with Morbid Productions [Australia] to release the Monuments of Impurity 7" EP [limited to 300]. It contained three tracks which included Blood, Death, Hatred â€“ a Mortal Sin number taken from their classic Mayhemic Destruction LP.
 
Soon after this, Obliterator was replaced by the blood barrels of Hellcunt [ex-Bestial Warlust, Anatomy] injecting a more solid edge to the band. Gospel of the Horns' debut on Damnation Records was released February 2000. Entitled Eve of the Conqueror, it consists of four tracks of unrelenting thrashing black metal... Desolation Descending, Eve of the Conqueror, Time to Strike and Gospel of the Horns.
 
Shortly after the release of Eve of the Conqueror, Gospel of the Horns embarked on their first European assault in July/August 2000. They played with bands such as Enthroned, Primordial, Pentacle, Thus Defiled, Arkhon Infaustus, Adorior and Hammerhawk. They conquered countries including Holland, Belgium, France, Ireland and England.
 
Gospel of the Horns' lyrical ideology confronts our most despised and traditional enemy and its conformist religion.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gospel+of+the+Horns">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
