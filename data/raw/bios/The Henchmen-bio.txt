For hip hop group go here â€“ Da Henchmen.

In response to the rise of reality television & the emerging ban on all culturally seditious behaviour, a psychobilly pop band called The Henchmen began hiring out halls & warehouses, putting on seditious showcases of reckless abandon disguised as 'parties'. 
At first nobody came. even their closest friends and family disassociated from this reckless band of loners & outcasts. So in 2004 they moved from the relative safety of Canberra and spread their 'party' across the national landscape, performing everywhere from Brisbane to Adelaide. 
After extensive Australian touring, they scored themselves a month long residency in Germany, performing with the likes of Hubert Von Kunt and the merry go round cue jumpers. 
Loosely based in Canberra, The Henchmen are busy running a warehouse venue in the inner city of Sydney as well as preparing for their second feature length album.
