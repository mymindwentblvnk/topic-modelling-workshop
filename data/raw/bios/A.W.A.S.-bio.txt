A.W.A.S. was formed 1999 in Bonn (NRW), Germany under the name "Torment", with Viktor on vocals, Martin on bass, Konni on guitar, Stephen on 2nd guitar, and Ruben on drums. Soon after though, Ruben left the band and Martin stepped behind the kit. They took a short break, and came back to life in 2001, doing their first gig in Aarau, Switzerland opening for Sacrificium. They then recorded a demo entitled "Time to Choose", which was released in January of 2003.

From 2003 - 2005, more line-up changes were to occur, including the departure of Stephen and Martin K. This would make A.W.A.S a four piece band, and bring aboard Eddy on the 4 string. This was also to be the final line-up of the band. They also had 2 of their songs released on the German "Deathophobia" sampler. The band would get their break in 2006, when they independently released their debut full-length album "Hope".

In September 2006, Open Grave Records took interest in the band, and signed them to give "Hope" a proper world wide release which was released in early 2007.

A.W.A.S. stands for "Acoustic War Against Satan".
