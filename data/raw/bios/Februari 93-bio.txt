Februari 93 was formed in 1994 and was a swedish folkmusic band, after the first record in 1997 two of the members left the band so februari 93 was put on ice. now it has started up once again with a different kind of sound and style. a test-recording was made during the summer 2004.
Music influences: doom metal, but mostly bands like landberk / paatos, anekdoten and the 3rd and the mortal.
