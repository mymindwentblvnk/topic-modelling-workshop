Deafest used to be called DunkelSkog ("dark forest" in Swedish) for a brief time in 2006. They played one show on 06/06/06 and then broke up. In 2008 they reformed under the name Deafest. Deafest was a three-piece with Yarv (of Dunkelheit) on drums and Marstaan (of Islets of Langerhans) on additional guitars, but unfortunately they had little time for Deafest because of other bands. Deafest was continued as a one-man-band by the original songwriter Chase until Brett joined the band on drums.
