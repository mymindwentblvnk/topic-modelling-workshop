SARJAN HASSAN is a crossover hardcore thrash band formed late 2003 at Port Klang Bay Area. SARJAN HASSAN is Man Beranak on vocals, Waqs on bass, Apizz Cash on guitars and Manusia Mesin on drums from start until now. We are a group of really good friends that likes to have fun, express our creativity, try to carry that intensity into our songwriting, to connect with like-minded people through communication and music, we are like-minded individuals who have been in countless failed band together (BLOCKAGE-r.i.p anarcho punk, D.O.E a.k.a DISTURBANCE ON EARTH-r.i.p street punk, BRING IT ON-r.i.p punk rock and CHANNEL X-youthcrew hardcore) and decided that we would finally get one to work.

We are that band with the skanker in the circle. You know, the running man. The mosher.

We still have been working on new material.
