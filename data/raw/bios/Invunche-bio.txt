The invunche is a deformed human with its head twisted backwards, besided having twisted arms, fingers, nose, mouth and ears. This creature walks on one foot or on three feet (one leg and two hands), because one of its legs is attached to the back of its neck. The invunche can't talk, communicating only by guttural, rough and unpleasant sounds. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Invunche">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
