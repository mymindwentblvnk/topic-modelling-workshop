Black Monday is back!

After the short-lived 2011 Reunion, Black Monday returns with new front man, Brian Christensen joined by Rusty Sanchez on bass, Scott Peterson on drums and the blistering guitar work of Dave Leyva. Vocalist Brian Christensen a.k.a. PIMP, former Shot to Hell front man and long time friend of the band, gives Black Monday an extra shot of adrenaline. Black Monday gets back to basics, returning to their punk rock roots and belting out a fresh new raucous sound – an amped-up mass of punk and rock ‘n’ roll.

From 1999-2006, Black Monday was a Los Angeles staple that shared the stage with punk rock legends Dee Dee Ramone, Fear, The Adicts, Agent Orange and The Dickies to name a few. Branching out of SoCal, Black Monday was also regulars in the Bay Area, Las Vegas and Texas, and even performed at SXSW. The band has been featured on several punk compilations with the likes of Tim Armstrong, Throw Rag, Duane Peters, Union 13 and The Distillers.

Before Black Monday’s demise in 2006, the band recorded their first full-length album, Broken Hearts & Broken Bones, which was unreleased. It features 13 high-octane tracks produced by BLASKO, bassist for Ozzy Osbourne. As part of their 2011 Reunion, Black Monday recorded two new songs that reflect the band’s aggressive and turbulent past. The first of the two Suicide Kings "The Underground, Vol. 1" was released on St. Patrick's Day 2012 and the second following in the Summer. Currently, Black Monday is working on the first release with their brand new line up. The upcoming five song EP will be titled: The Black Hell EP. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Black+Monday">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
