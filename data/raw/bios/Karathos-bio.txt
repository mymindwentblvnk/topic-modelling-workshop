Karathos is a Technical Black Metal band from Omaha, NE. Karathos formed in March 2010 by Kyle Androy Joe McLaughlin with Steve Pelish joining shortly after. At which time we recorded a 4 track demo with a drum machine. Joey Cardenas joined in February 2011 to complete the line up. We then released our demo in April 2011 at our first show. In July we parted ways with our second guitarist and are currently looking for a new one. We are currently recording for our upcoming EP Kingdom Ov Plague. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Karathos">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
