December 2003, On a grim mid-winternight in the outskirt of Betekom, Grimm and Demorg decided to create a project outing their blackened inner senses to the world with true hellspawn music. The very beginning of Demonic Empire was born. After playing together for a while, Mornoct joined the band around March 2005. The Empire was nearly completed, they just needed blasphemic lyrics to support their infernal music. Covatan joins the Empire in July 2005. From this point on they start creating new and better material so fast that even Demorg has trouble following the rythm.. The ultimate damnation to come.. May our Demonic Empire Blacken creation
