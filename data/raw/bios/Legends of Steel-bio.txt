Legends of steel is a 5 piece heavy/powermetal alliance between Molenbeersel (Belgium) and Maaseik (Belgium).

The band started in October 2006 and was ready, after a couple of changes in the band lineup, to hit the stage in 2008.
Through the many gigs, the band played with tons of other great bands (The Guardian, Sons of Irah, Final Gates, Steel Horse, ...)

April 2009, Legends of steel became the winner of Battle of steel, Antwerp. That victory gave them the opportunity to record their first demo-cd which was released in 2010.
