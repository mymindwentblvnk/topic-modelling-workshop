Mytra is a progressive metal band from Hungary.

The band was formed in early 1996, after Robert Hocza (guitar, vocals), Krisztian Bekei (bass guitar) and Gabor Somodi(keyboards) of the disbanded Prophecy joined Gabor Bartok(guitar) and Laszlo Zabari (drums), who had been playing music together for a few years. Their first appearance was in August of 1996, at the annual  battle of the bands talent search, that sadly has not been organized in recent years. The band won fourth prize at this same event in 1999 and even won a special prize courtesy of Metal Hammer magazine.

The following years saw numerous member changes for the band's keyboardist and base guitarist positions, but finally with the joining of Larion Olah (keyboards) and Zoltan Almasi (bass guitar), the EP entitled Meaningless Heavenly Being was produced under Backwards Productions. 2002 proved to be a calmer year with never member changes.
Then, in late 2005, the present band finally took shape: Robert Hocza and Gabor Devenyi on guitars, Roland Lovas on bass guitar and Laszlo Zabari on drums, and supplying the music's instrumental and machine-backed elements.
