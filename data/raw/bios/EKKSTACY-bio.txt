ekkstacy is an artist from Vancouver, Canada. He always wanted to be an artist, but he felt like that was something he couldn’t do because he didn’t have the confidence. However, after going through drug induced psychosis, his parents divorce, and alcohol abuse he found himself writing and recording music everyday. He took influence from film, and artists including Elliott Smith, The Drums, Bon Iver, and Bedroom. Right now, ekkstacy describes his current sound as a fuse of indie, post punk, and synth wave. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/EKKSTACY">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
