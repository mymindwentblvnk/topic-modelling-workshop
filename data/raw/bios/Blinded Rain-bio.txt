The story of Blinded Rain began in 2004 when Kaide, the guitar player and singer of Blinded Rain, found himself wondering what to do with the bunch of songs he had written. Songs did not fit to the style of existing band and after a few seconds thinking the answer was clear. As the outcome the first line-up of Blinded Rain (Kaide, Tapsu on drums, J. Partanen on bass) was recording the first Blinded Rain album Time ? already in the beginning of 2005. After having made the Time ? the vision of Blinded Rain´s music became more clear and as the existing line-up saw daylight in January 2006 (Leonard on drums, Günther on bass) the vision started to grow to it´s final form. Band was very satisfied with the new songs that arised and decided to enter the studio for recording the Vampie CD-EP in September – October 2006. Vampire was recorded, mixed and mastered at the legendary Sundicoop Studio in Savonlinna by Tuomo Valtonen and it contains 5 powerful songs. Vampire CD-EP will introduce Blinded Rain´s hard rock/metal combination with heavier and expanded sound, which includes a bit of classical touch and female vocals. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Blinded+Rain">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
