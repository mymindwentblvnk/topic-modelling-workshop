1. 25 year old multi instrumentalist James Kelly is until now best known as the sole permanent member and writer behind black metal outfit Altar Of Plagues, who has released three critically acclaimed albums on the labels Profound Lore and Candlelight. Using found sounds, home made instruments and field recordings as a base, Altar Of Plagues creates music "Full of radical tangents and alien-to-black metal elements, more focused on frailty and struggle than majesty and grandeur" (Pitchfork). These ideas transfer to James' solo recordings as WIFE, which also reveal his long-standing interest in electronic music. The EP "Stoic" was released on Left Bank in 2012. His debut album "What's Between", co-produced by Roly Porter and Bobby Krlic (The Haxan Cloak), is released on Tri Angle in June 2014.

3. Wife is the brainchild of Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada based person Joel Blechinger. Wife is the result of a 3 day intensive-retreat-trip Joel took to his cabin, lugging with him as many instruments as he could find and competently (or in most cases incompetently) play. The results of those fruitful sessions comprise the majority of the Home Taping Is Killing Music EP which will soon be available for free download.

4. Featuring Nick Steinhardt (Touche Amore) and Andrew Thomas, Wife created all sounds using guitar and bass only. Debut album 'Pipe Candy' is out and limited to 250 pieces. Can be purchased via Deathwish :
