Various Production is a collective of musicians and producers.  Excessive  energy is not put  in to self-promotion,  nor is it the intent to envelope itself in mystery. The core objective is to focus solely on the music and give a platform for artists to thrive. Often difficult to define and put into a category Various Production's multi-genre spanning music has a common thread - to take the simple and make something complex with depth, always challenging the listener and artist.
