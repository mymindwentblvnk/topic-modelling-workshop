Keving Huizing aka Budakid is an extremely promising talent hailing from Tilburg in the southern Netherlands. The young, self-taught producer and dj - who is inspired by the likes of Todd Terje, Stimming, Jimpster and acts such as Tame Impala, Tycho and Caribou - is steadily developing his melodic style.

Budakid’s tracks have been released on labels such as Einmusika, Jalapeño Records and Manual Music. He is is currently readying a remix for the heavy weight Get Physical imprint.

The media is very enthusiastic about the young Dutchman too, with well-known blogs including Indies​huffle, Purple Sneakers and VICE’s Thump supporting his music on a regular basis.

His dj sets at the Solar, Indian Summer and Kindergarten festivals, as well his club shows at the world-famous Melkweg in Amsterdam and Effenaar in Eindhoven made him an instant crowd favorite in Holland. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Budakid">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
