Crimson Relic was a death doom metal band from California (formly from Texas) blended the best points of early Celtic Frost, early Entombed, and with additional touches of Slayer. The result is crushing but groovy death metal. Their only album Purgatory's Reign was released on 1996. 

Line-up on the album:
Rhett Davis - Drums, Timpani
Xan Hammack - Guitar, Bass, Vocals
Gary Griffith - Guest vocals
Jeremy Peto - Guest vocals
