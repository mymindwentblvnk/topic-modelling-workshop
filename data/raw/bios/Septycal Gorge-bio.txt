Septycal Gorge were an Italian Brutal death metal  band formed in2004 by Diego (Guitars) and Mariano (Vocals), after a week Dave (Drums) joined. However, there were alot of changes in the coming months and year, with Alex, Giampaolo, Damien all showing their time in the bass position and Marco (Guitars). Then the line up finally found stability with Dario (Guitars), Maurizio (Bass), Diego (Guitars) and Mariano (Vocals).

The band then imediatley began to record their "Delivering Hidden Mutilation" demo in 2005. This was finally released by Mutilated Records, which featured the fast style of other Italian bands and a slam influence aswell from the slam death metal scene, most notable being Devourment and Deeds of Flesh. 

They then released their well anticipated 2006 debut album "Growing Seeds of Decay" on  Mutilated Records. This featured the early demo songs aswell as four more new songs with the new line up all taking part. This was recieved greatly in the scene and got them toruing with such bands as Mortuary Drape, Vomit the Soul (Ita), Faust (Ita) and Wargore.

After, the band left the Czech-label  Mutilated Records and went on to do a Promo in 2007, which amounted to a split release called "Da Vinci Death Code" with Fleshgod Apocalypse, Modus Delicti and Onirik (Ita) on  Ripper Tattoo Productions.

The band are going to release their follow up to their debut with "Erase The Insignificant" which is hopefully being released sometime in september 2009. To promote the album they are doing a couple of fests this summer in Italy and then they might be doing a European  Tour after the release in the Autumn.
