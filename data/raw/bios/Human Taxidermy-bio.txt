Human Taxidermy is one-man deathgrind band from USA. Anthony Roark  (All Instruments, also in Chronic Audio Assault, The Anti-Human , Despondency (US)) wanted to express a more damaging and chaotic sort of music on his own this time. He started in 2002 and quickly began starting on the fast furious twists and turns of deathgrind.

Anthony released a split album with his two of his other one man projects creating slightly different types of death metal, this was self-released in 2003. This put him on the scene offically and he started to create more songs for his debut.

The band then moved forward and created his self-released and self-titled debut album which increased the manaic behaviour of his techniques on guitar and drums with shrieking vocals. 

He then started on other projects around his area, and Human Taxidermy was on hold. Until in 2007, he brought his borther, Charles into the framework for his new onslaught and follow up to his debut album. The Distinction of Extincion was released in 2008 by Independant records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Human+Taxidermy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
