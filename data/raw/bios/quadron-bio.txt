An offshoot of the Denmark-based Boom Clap Bachelors massive collective, Quadron is an avant R&B (with an occasional nudge toward folk-soul) duo of multi-instrumentalist/producer Robin Braun (aka Robin Hannibal, also one-half of the duo Owusu & Hannibal) and vocalist Coco O. In 2009, Quadron began issuing their collaborations, led by the off-center mid-'60s soul throwback "Slippin," which was used in the film Se Min Kjole. A little later in the year, outside their homeland, BBC DJ Gilles Peterson was floored enough by the sparse, abstract "Day" to slot the song into the year-end All Winners special of his Worldwide program. Los Angeles' Plug Research label picked up their self-titled album for wide circulation and issued it in March 2010. Braun and Coco were subsequently sought out by numerous artists -- including Leon Ware, the Internet, and Tyler, The Creator -- for collaborations. Their cover of Michael Jackson's "Baby Be Mine" was included on the soundtrack to the 2012 film Think Like a Man. In 2013, Braun made an album with Mike Milosh as Rhye, while Coco was featured on the soundtrack to Baz Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby. That June, they released their second album, Avalanche, on Sylvia Rhone's Epic-associated Vested in Culture label. ~ Andy Kellman, Rovi <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Quadron">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
