Daigoro is one of the musical projects by Dave Fyans from Perth, Scotland. At this moment Daigoro is silenced, but Fyans goes on making music as Erstlaub. The music in both projects is ambient based, though where Daigoro is more in the field of minimalism and sometimes post-rock influenced, Erstlaub is more dark-ambient and drones. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Daigoro">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
