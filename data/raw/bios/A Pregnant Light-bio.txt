"Naked. "My Game Doesn't Have a Name" is A Pregnant Light unadorned. Stripped to its core elements. Riff, melody, harmony and rhythm. Love, fear and pain. Life, and death.


A Pregnant Light creator Damian R. Master recently stood at a crossroads. The project had evolved beyond metaphor. The multi-instrumentalist, vocalist and songwriter once cloaked the music in obscurities. Sprawling arrangements. Complicated language. A humming crackling cassette. Abstraction. But the new work demanded clarity. A direct line from head to voice to heart to hands to you.


A new APL was birthed. DRM refers to the entity's product as "purple metal," perhaps with tongue in cheek. Perhaps not. Now, it's the music's only suggestive element. It implies the molting of simplistic classifcation - metal, punk, hardcore, pop, indie, alt-rock. But it's not contrived. It's a pure thing. Unconventional. Regal. A thing about piety and faith, vanity and individualism. About bare ego. A deeply personal product, austere. 


Doors were opened. To accomplished supporting musicians. A studio. An engineer. A severe editorial hand. To a new purpleness, in idea and tone, a thing to be felt,  not seen. The result was "My Game Doesn't Have a Name." A definitive statement. With slashing guitars, sticky hooks, true words. It's audacious. Bold. Resolute. Dynamic. Assertive. Dramatic. Confident. Heavy. Light. A Pregnant Light."
