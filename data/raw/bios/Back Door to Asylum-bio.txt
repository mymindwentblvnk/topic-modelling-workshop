Description
Second spawn of Moscow-based brutal tech-death formation is a true monster inspired by the undiscovered and unexplored depths of space and human minds. By developing its sound, full of blistering guitars, inhuman accelerated vocals and intricate drums, Back Door to Asylum has stepped up in field of technical extremity. Empowered by guest vocals of Julien Truchan (Benighted) and Fabio Marin (Internal Suffering) as well as the master of drone guitars Ilya Lipkin (Re-Stoned, Foggy Realm), "Cerberus Millenia" is a true journey of pleasure and horror for every extreme music listener.
