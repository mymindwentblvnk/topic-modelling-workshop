In the Colonnades had their roots in punk and early 70's Traditional Doom, Heavy Metal and Hard Rock, which can be heard on their early releases up til and including 'Scrap Metal Value'.

Heavy organ and expressive almost Gothic Rock vocals dominate their music.

The last album - Rest and Recreation - was recorded in the Sunlight Studio by Fred Estby and Thomas Skogsberg. On this album In the Colonnades took up the contemporary style of Death 'n Roll - a style Entombed introduced a couple of years before.
