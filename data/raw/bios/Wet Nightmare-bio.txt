Wet Nightmare is a band so anti-social, its two members can barely tolerate each other long enough to play thirty seconds songs. Known to openly taunt the audience to the point of rioting, these two dysfunctional fuckwits are lucky to escape their own shows. They live in Delaware and are not happy about it. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wet+Nightmare">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
