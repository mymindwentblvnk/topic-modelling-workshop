Before going on his own, he was the singer for the German progressive metal band Dreamscape on their CD "very" (1999). In 2002, he  released an EP called "CUT", featuring re-arranged versions of his favorite 80s songs from such bands as Rush, The Cars, A-ha, and Mr. Mister, performed in Rock/Metal style (guitars by Marcel Coenen).

In 2003, he released "EmOcean", a concept album about such themes as Atlantis, the Sargasso Sea and the Bermuda Triangle.

His latest CD is the concept album KAILASH, released on February 27, 2006. This recording deals with a story about a man on a quest who travels to the Himalayas and ultimately reaches Mount Kailash. It presents Tibetan concepts and Hiduist philosophy. Like on EmOcean, Hubi was closely collaborating with Vivien Lalu again, the rest of the line-up features Spanish guitarist Jorge Sal√°n ("Mago de Oz"), Marcel Coenen ("Sun Caged"), Swedish drummer Daniel Flores (Mind's Eye) and the bass by Johan Niemann (Therion) and Joop Wolters, who played the guitars on the 2 bonus tracks. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hubi+Meisel">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
