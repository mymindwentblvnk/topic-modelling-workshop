Our Diabolical Embrace is the Symphonic Gothic Black Metal project of HDR Owner - N. Skog, drawing influences from bands outside the spectrum of the underground scene, and instead from bands such as Cradle of Filth - circa 1994-2003, Nightwish, Graveworm, and Dimmu Borgir. Do not expect anything familiar to Ancient Tundra in any way, as this is metal in its full blackened glory. Featuring a guest appearance from depressive black metal musician 'Mort' (Exiled From Light), as well as a ten-minute bonus track originally written for the now-defunct project 'A Dark Fantasy' ! This album comes packaged in a standard jewel case with an 8 page booklet with all of the album's lyrics printed. http://hypnoticdirgerecords.com/ <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Our+Diabolical+Embrace">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
