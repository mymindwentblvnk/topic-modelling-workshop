the first (to my knowledge) cromwell was a noisy metallic hardcore band from detroit that existed from 1996 - 2000? formed by ex members of ricochet and released splits with scout and thoughts of ionesco. there was also supposed to be a full length cd out but i never saw it................













Cromwell first emerged on the music scene in 2005 formed by guitarist Markus Estrada, bassist Scott Deloyer, drummer Marty Elliott & vocalist Kenny Russell. After the success their first EP “So Close to Forever” brought them [which included a slot on Warped Tour ‘06] the guys went straight to work (and the studio) taking a break from shows for almost 5 months before releasing their highly anticipated  full-length CD "Illusion & Obsession" in March of 07. After a few nation wide tours and the release of  EP "dancing on the moon" , Cromwell has recently started workin with producer Ulrich Wild and now have another EP "Faces" set for release in  late 2010 with an expected full length in early 2011.

There was also a second band named Cromwell from Ireland in the early 70s. They made one album: At the Gallop.
