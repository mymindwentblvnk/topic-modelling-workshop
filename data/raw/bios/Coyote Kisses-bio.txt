Forward thinking electronic outfit Coyote Kisses was bred in the swampy wetlands of central Florida, the musical brainchild of high school friends Joe Sussingham and Bryce Bresnan. The two discovered a keen creative synergy playing in various rock bands together before founding a live electronic band under the name Coyote Kisses, quickly gaining a local following due to their inherent musicianship and theatrical live performances.
