Even Vast is a band from Aosta, Italy, founded in 1998. Changed their name to Even More Vast in 2008.
They played melodic, but relatively slow doom metal with female vocals. Enjoyable music for the more romantic-minded doom fan and those of us who like their doom with a little bit more melody.
The female vocals are "normal", ensuring a more rocky feeling to the music than, for example, found in gothic metal bands.

Last line-up:
Antonietta Scilipoti - vocals, synthesizer
Luca Martello - guitars, programming
Vincenzo Di Leo - bass, guitars
