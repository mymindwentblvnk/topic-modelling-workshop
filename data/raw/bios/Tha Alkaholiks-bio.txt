Tha Alkaholiks, also known as Tha Liks, is an American hip-hop trio from Los Angeles, California, United States. Since the early 1990s they have produced party music with a hardcore hip hop edge, powered by the beats of DJ and producer E-Swift (born Eric Brooks in Columbus, Georgia, raised in Toledo, Ohio) and the rhymes of J-Ro (born James Robinson in Los Angeles) and Tash (born Rico Smith in Cincinnati). 

Though commercial crossover success largely eluded the group, they maintained a dedicated following on their native West Coast, throughout the United States and worldwide. Tha Alkaholiks were also featured with their own song "Daaam!" featuring Finger Eleven on Loud Rocks.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tha+Alkaholiks">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
