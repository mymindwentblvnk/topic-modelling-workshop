1. Suburban Maryland ska punk band from the era of a million ska punk bands.  Slightly experimental at some points. "World to Me" is probably their biggest hit from their 1996-2002 career. Members later went on to be in such bands a XLooking ForwardX and Hello Tokyo. 

2. A prominent and influential band to the Peoria Hardcore scene in the late 90's and early 2000's. Subsist played and toured in those days a decent amount. Having a unique semi christian/ straightedge viewpoint and yet not coming out and straight up saying that the band is christian or straightedge set them apart from the hordes of hardcore bands that did in those days. They were often compared to other metallic hardcore bands of those days such as Converge, Coalesce, and Botch. former members went on to form bands such as Minsk (Relapse Records) and Dead to Fall (Victory Records).

3. Subsist is an electronic musician from Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.  He has released one EP, titled "Purist" in 2011.

4. A powerviolence band from Vancouver, BC. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Subsist">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
