There are four bands with the name The Law.

1: Hailing from Dundee, and riding on a new wave of enthusiasm for new music in the town, The Law first came to light playing at the Doghouse. As a powerful 4 piece, they initially got together writing & playing songs as a means of venting frustration at birds and bosses, and have grown hugely in the past year.

Several sessions at the T-Pot Studios with established producer Robin Evans and a recent UK tour with mates The View has earned the band nationwide interest. With a set of album worthy tunes and more songs in the making The Law are set for a busy 2007.......
