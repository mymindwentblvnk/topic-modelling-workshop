Death metal band from Uppsala, Sweden. Now known as Invidious.

The idea of starting a death metal band came up in winter of 2004/2005. P. Pestilence and G. Grotesque had a project called Vomit. They wanted it to sound like Entombed, Nihilist, Grave and Dismember. At the same time Adde B Obscene and A. Asphyx had the idea of a death metal band (Katalysator) and they wanted it to sound like Entombed and Sepultura etc. P. Pestilence, Adde B Obscene and A. Asphyx decided to go together and start playing and soon H. Death joined. They had their first rehersal in early 2005 and on the second rehersal G. Grotesque joined. Pretty soon they were going to play at the Uppsala grind/death metal festival Uppsala Blodbad. So they got some songs together rehearsed as fuck. But the gig sucked anyway. It was cool as hell but they weren't tight and they had been drinking lots of beer. They forgot the songs and it was chaos. After the Uppsala Blodbad-gig they thought that they should record a demo. Zombie Destruction was recorded all by themselves in G. Grotesque's and P. Pestilence's garage. The songs were pretty simple and the lyrics were just about zombies and stuff like that. The sound wasn't that good. The demo was released in November the same year, and they played a couple of gigs during the winter. In 2006 they only had one gig but they werebusy writing songs for a new demo (Mass Genocide Ritual). 4 songs were written but only 3 got on tape. They were recorded and produced by Affe (of Undergång) at Ungdomens Hus during September - October. It was mastered by Uno Bruniusson (of In Solitude/Undergång). Now they have changed name to Invidious and an MLP is to be released under the new name. For further news visit the Invidious myspace.
