Poemisia are a symphonic metal band, born in Naples in 2011 by Marco Monaco and Tina Gagliotta who complete the line up with Ciro Scognamiglio, Giuseppe Carillo and Vincenzo Grande.
The musical style of the band is focused on sounds which combine metal music to opera and symphonic elements, which are also made by the light-lyric soprano voice of Tina. This duality leads to a tendency to mark the continuous conflict between darkness and light, between death and life, between Hell and Heaven, sometimes also in a peculiar grotesque way. This is fully reflected also in the lyrics which have always a refined nature. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Poemisia">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
