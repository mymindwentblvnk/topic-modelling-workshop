Exhausted was a Finnish grunge/alternative group led by singer/guitarist/songwriter Antti Loponen, who plays now guitar in the band Jermaine. Arttu Äikäs, now of the post-rock group Locomotora, played bass throughout Exhausted's career, but the drummers changed from time to time. The last and most long-lasting drummer was Valtteri Numminen, who sings now in Starlight Nine. Exhausted released three EP's and one self-published album, All Your Moods(2005). They played about 50 shows around Finland before disbanding in late 2005.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Exhausted">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
