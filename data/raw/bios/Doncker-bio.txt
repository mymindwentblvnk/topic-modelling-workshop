Metal and Melody combined, resulting in a new musical era and putting it to the test in ‘DONCKER’.

When ex-members of Sengir and L.O.I. decided they needed a new musical impuls, it wasn’t hard to figure out how it would, could and should sound. Creating a new concept with influences of not only Rammstein, Gothminister, Disturbed, Korn, Godsmack, Arch Enemy, Katatonia, Moonspell, Marilyn Manson,... but also grooves of the more commercialized music-scene. Best described as “unbounded by time and melody, driven by insatiable motivation and intuitive sense of rhythm”. All 5 driven musicians are experienced at the top of the international metal-scene and already performed on major events as GMM and MFVF. At the end it is what it is: Contrary to tradition, Hard, Honest, straight ahead music leaving no-one behind …or standing still.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Doncker">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
