Chthe'ilist are a death metal band from Québec, Canada. The band was created in 2010 right after the dissolution of Phil Tougas' side project "Spheres". The band recorded their first demo in 2011 but it was released a year later. Despite being from Quebec, their sound is very similar to that of 90s Finnish death metal, some comparisons are Demilich, Demigod, Adramelech, and also highly comparable to the more recent founded Finnish death metal band Krypts. They released their debut full-length album 'Le Dernier Crépuscule' on January 29, 2016 through Profound Lore Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Chthe%27ilist">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
