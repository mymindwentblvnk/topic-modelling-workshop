There are multiple bands with this name. 
1. DC soulpunks making music about love, death, and revolution, in any order and definitely overlapping. Smooth and sharp, warm and galvanizing, punchy, political and personal. Their set is guaranteed to get your body moving and your feelings flowing.  Featuring Shady Rose (they/them) on lead vocals, Vitamin Dee (she/her) on keys, Matty K (he/him) on sax, Beck (he/him) on guitar, Yousef (he/him) on drums, and Frankie Goodbye (x/x) on bass.

2. Christan metlal band Lightmare (http://www.lightmare.de/) was founded 1991 by five friends who finally got a chance to become musicians. They started with lead vocals, 2 guitars, bass guitar and drums. Shortly after its foundation the idea came up to record their first 3 track demo tape called “Lightmare”

After 1 ½ years progress the second guitar was replaced by a keyboard and the need for another demo came up. According to that in the middle of 1993 another demo tape was recorded called “Certain Death”.
Because of the relative high demand it was released on CD as well. The title should reflect that everybody on this earth has to die but the way we live has consequences beyond death.
In regards to Lightmare’s musical development “Certain Death” documents for the first time the influences of classical music.

In 1993/1994 members changed but this didn’t have any impact on the band in regards to its activities.Due to the fact that the band still didn’t have any signed contract with a record label Lightmare decided to record their second CD themselves.  It was released 1994/1995 called “Vampires” . The musical style remained, however the melodies matured. The reactions to the CD were immense:  positive reviews and following interviews of and for US and European magazines (for example Heavens Metal, Metal Crusade, Heavy oder was ?, Rock Hard).  In the December 1995 Lightmare won a Hard Rock / Heavy Metal competition in Offenbach / Germany and participated also in a big competition of a Southern German radio broadcast station (SDR Wild live festival).

At the beginning of 1997 Lightmare signed a contract with Treasure Hunt record label and publishing house.  Despite later differences and unpleasant actions on the part of the label, which leads years later to the notice of the contract, for the first time professionally a CD was recorded.  The CD “The Fool” was sold in many countries, which can be read off from the many reactions via email and WWW.  This can be explained also with the innumerable reviews in magazines throughout the World. With “The Fool” harder elements are introduced into the music but classical musical kept its influence still. The key message of “The Fool” is based on the Bible “Luke 12”: Man should not focus on money and might but should seek God.
 
Lightmare played with considerable artists (among others with Ken Tamplin) and on various concerts and festivals in and outside of Germany. In the recent past the band had to go through some member changes and it became relatively quite around Lightmare. Finally the band got together again ... Some of its members have side projects which are sometimes even more than that....
