Peter Rosenberg is new to New York City, but not to hip hop or radio. Rosenberg spent the last decade djing in clubs and doing radio shows all over the DC area and nationally on XM Satellite Radio.

Most recently he developed a national following for his talk show, The Peter Rosenberg Show and hit video parodies. Rosenberg’s videos, “Throw Some Cheese On It” and “This is Why Duke Sucks“, have generated millions of views and landed him all over the web and in the pages of hip hop magazines like “XXL” and “Scratch”.

His Hot 97 show, “Real Late with Peter Rosenberg“, has created a major stir in the streets of New York. His mix of “real talk” and underground taste has endeared him to a hip hop community hungry for something both authentic and provocative. His video interviews with celebrities ranging from 50 Cent to Rob Zombie have made him constant fodder for bloggers worldwide and have earned him status as a rare interviewing talent. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Peter+Rosenberg">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
