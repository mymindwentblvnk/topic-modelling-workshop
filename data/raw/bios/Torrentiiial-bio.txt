Torrentiiial’s music is affecting, funky, and infinitely memorable. His lyrics present an unflinching account of his experiences and beliefs, covering everything from social anxiety and depression, to love and commitment, to domestic violence, police brutality, and the Black Lives Matter movement. His sound is his own and ‘a stunning combination of funk and hip-hop that will continue to set him apart and elevate his profile with each release. With an ear for groovy instrumentals and impressive flows, he makes putting together high-quality music seem easy’ (Ones To Watch).

His influences include fellow Hawaiian Bruno Mars, the Soul Train era, and J. Cole while his combination of message and music—in the great tradition of Sam Cooke and Marvin Gaye—is captivating listeners at a rapid pace.

His single ‘Sweet Tooth Baby’ was selected for Spotify’s New Music Friday playlist, he’s been featured on iHeartRadio, in EARMILK and numerous Hawaiian online publications, and he’s played shows at The PlayStation Theatre at Times Square, The Novo DTLA, and at The Republik in Honolulu.

Torrentiiial is defining what artist development means in 2020. Through his partnership with Acme Music, he is continuing to refine his sound and find his audience in an industry that traditionally neglects creative growth. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Torrentiiial">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
