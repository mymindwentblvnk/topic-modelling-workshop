Vulture King is a hard rock band based out of Monterey, CA. Its current lineup consists of Danny Frank (vocals), Patrick Golden (guitars), Daniel McCormick (bass), and Steve Lenard (drums). 

The band has its earliest roots as a separate, thrash-influence group known as Hades Landscape, which had formed in the summer of 2008. After the dissolution of that band in 2009, Patrick and Danny continued their musical association, eventually recruiting Steve Lenard (fellow bandmate with Patrick in the Irish rock band Bog Iron) and Daniel McCormick (of Daft Mystical Creatures), establishing Vulture King in the winter of 2009. The band has gone through several lineup changes. Past members include: the former bassist for Liquid 8, an accomplished MMA fighter (of Calijuana), the former bass player of Martyrs of a Lost Generation, a double-bassist with the Monterey Symphony Orchestra, and a creature that was thought to have been a troll, among many others. On May 10, 2011, they released their debut, a 36-minute EP entitled "The Death of Day ."

They are self described as "low, heavy rock" or "hard rock", but have been described by others as gothic rock or gothic metal. The band has acknowledged definite doom leanings, but have refrained from describing themselves as a doom metal band. Danny Frank's baritone voice has drawn comparisons to Peter Steel of Type O Negative and  Carl McCoy of Fields of the Nephilim.

Their debut can be preview in its entirety at their offical website, www.VultureKing.com.
