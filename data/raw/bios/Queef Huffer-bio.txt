.. QUEEF HUFFER plays porngoregrind/death metal.

 The concept of the band was thought up between Goremaggot and Ern (both at the time in VOMIT SPAWN) in early 2005. The band officially formed in October of 2005 with the addition of guitarist Brian Smith (of DEAD CENTRE) and bassist Bryan "Lizard" Pleasent. After just one weekend of practice a few songs were written. Quickly the band was booked on its first two shows. The band wrote seven songs in about a month in preperation for their first show. Due to an injury Lizard was forced to miss this show and a friend of the band, Willem "Killem" Reeders (of CURSED RUIN), learned the songs in just a couple days to fill-in on bass. Willem later joined as a guitarist though performed with the band only doing vocals on 1 song for a couple shows. Due to personal reasons he soon left the band. Willem is credited with writing the song 'Gore Whore' which is named after a previous band/project of his.

 The band played several shows around the state over the next couple years, including some small fests and a mini-tour, though never recorded or released any material until 2007/2008.
 Dave Carrin (x-DEAD FLESH/VOMIT SPAWN/PHALLIC DECAPITANT/TOE IN THE TRIGGER, etc) joined as guitarist in 2007 but left the band in early 2010.

 The band recorded for thier debut cd Dec 2007.
 The debut cd "Infatuation With Vaginal Flatulence" was released by Rotten Roll Rex from Germany, as a split with Australian gore/death/grind band NOTHIN' SUSS in February 2009.

 The song 'The Gainesville Ripper' appears on the Serial Killer Records compilation- The Last Supper (2008) featuring songs inspired by serial killers & mass murderers. Still available directly from the band.

 5 new songs were recorded in May 2009. Recording was done by Jim Ross of Cystic Dysentery & Feculent Abcess. 3 songs were planned for a split 7"ep but none of this material has been officially released.

 Utter Disgust Records released "Infatuation With Vaginal Flatulence" on limited cassette, 100 hand numbered copies, in January 2010.
