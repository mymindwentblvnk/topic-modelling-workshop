Kaunis Kuolematon is Finnish for "Beautiful Immortal".

The band was formed in Hamina, Finland in winter 2012. At first, Mikko Heikkilä was writing songs in English, but then, for a deeper touch, and to tell their expression in their native language, they switched to Finnish.

Initially, Kaunis Kuolematon consisted of M. Heikkilä (vocals / guitar), J. Uski (bass) and M. Hostikka (drums). After a few rehearsals, V. Mussalo (guitar) and O. Suvanto (vocals) joined the band for a full line-up.

In autumn 2012, the band recorded  their first mini-EP "Kaunis kuolematon" with the help of Juuso Elmisen (recording), and Saku Moilanen (production / mixing / mastering). In 2013 Kaunis Kuolematon started to give live shows in Finland, released a single "En ole mitään" ("I Am Nothing") and participated in the Metal Storm festival in Switzerland.

Their first full-length album "Kylmä Kaunis Maailma" ("Cold Beautiful World") was recorded in late 2013 and released in the beginning of 2014. Also, a music video was filmed for "En ole mitään".
