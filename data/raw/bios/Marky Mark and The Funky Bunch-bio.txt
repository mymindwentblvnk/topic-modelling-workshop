Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch was a 90s-era hip-hop group led by performer Mark Wahlberg. Members included Scott Ross (alias Scottie Gee), Hector Barros (alias Hector the Bootie Inspector), Duffy Culligan (alias Duffle), Terry Yancey (alias DJ-T), Dan Hartzman (alias Dan-o Fresh), and Anthony Thomas (alias Ashey Ace). The group's best known song is "Good Vibrations", which was a number one hit in 1991. Also having a highly popular music video, the tune was off of the group's album 'Music for the People'. 

Having yet another a hit in the song "Wildside", the group experienced massive success with 'Music for the People'. The album ended up being certified as platinum by the RIAA. Still, the group appeared to have peaked too early, and subsequent releases failed to meet expectations. It would only be a few years before the Funky Bunch went from just getting started to breaking up.

Mark Wahlberg went on to become a successful actor in movies such as 'Boogie Nights', 'The Italian Job', 'Max Payne', and many others. Mark's brother, Donnie Wahlberg, kept his musical career going by being a part of the pop group New Kids on the Block, and he also became a successful actor as the years went by. The work of Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch remain popular among many fans and have been included in numerous multi-artist compilation albums.
