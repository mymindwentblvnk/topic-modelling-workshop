Ethereal Riffian was formed in summer of 2010 in Kyiv, Ukraine. After spending several years trying different musical styles, they found sonic vibrations which sounded close to their collective consciousness. The debut work of Ethereal Riffian - "Shaman's Visions" is the result of their long search.

Eclectic music forged by the band combines hypnotic grooves and heaviness of stoner / doom metal, shades of mind-bending psychedelia, blasts of ground-breaking rock & metal, and a mixture of experiments, which, at first sight, seem to be unmixable.
