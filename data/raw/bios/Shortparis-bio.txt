Formed in Saint Petersburg in 2012.

Their music is experiment-orientated. Live performances of the band are beyond the scope of your typical musical shows, they are more like performative practices of the contemporary art. Challenging the system of club venue shows, "Shortparis" actively performs at unprepared venues: abandoned industrial buildings, open grocery stores, etc.

The band poses itself in opposition to the current musical scene. Being a pioneer, the band sets its sight on finding original musical and artistic solutions. 
The band dissolved in the autumn of 2020, soon after the musicians had fulfilled their musical ambitions and had decided to dedicate themselves to farming.

post-pop / pop-noir / avant-pop / experimental
