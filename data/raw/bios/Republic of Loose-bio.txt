Republic of Loose are a Dublin-based band who have broken the seal of the usual run-of-the-mill Irish singer/songwriter act.
                 
Blasting onto the the music scene through the help of Phantom FM with "Hold Up!," The Loose gained the foundation of a firm fanbase. With the gospel-like vocals and back-to-basics funk, the lads sell out venues such as The Ambassador, The Village, and The Stables.
          
With the recent release of Aaagh!, the group have gained a larger fanbase and regular airplay on national radio in Ireland.

The band is comprised of Mick Pyro (vocals), Brez (guitar), Dave Pyro (guitar), Benjamin Loose (bass), Andres (drums), and Deco (keyboards).
