FEHLER are a four-piece sludge metal outfit from the south of the Netherlands, known for their dark blend of ground shaking riffs combined with heavy rhythms and dissonant, black metal like atmospheres. Key influences to their sound are sludge heavy weights like Crowbar and Torche but also feature the more melodic aspects of bands like Mastodon and High on Fire. Their songs vary from short and aggressive outbursts to sound-layered epics.

In 2009, Black Death Records releases their debut ep Adharma, which recieved great reviews by national and international press, leading to to shows with bands like Kickback, Kylesa, Black Breath, Amenra, Keelhaul and the Dillinger Escape Plan as well as appearances on prestigious underground festivals like Incubate and Le Guess Who? After a line-up change in which the band adds a second guitar player (Twan van Geel of Legion Of The Damned), FEHLER take their time writing first-class material for their full length release, released in 2012 by  Hammerheart Records.

FEHLER line up: Freek (bass/vocals) Ruud (drums) Demian (guitar) Twan (guitar).
