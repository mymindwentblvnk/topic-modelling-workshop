Last Chapter are notable for employing Solitude Aeturnus frontman Robert Lowe as guest vocalist on their debut album. Musically, Last Chapter isn't too far removed from Solitude Aeturnus -- doom metal with a progressive touch, and Lowe's distinctive vocals make the comparison that much more valid. Slightly more on the doom side than SA, and a few tracks (notably the instrumentals) wander off into psychedelic territory. The Living Waters is definitely recommended for Solitude Aeturnus fans, but also doom fans in general. A new vocalist was recruited (who, coincidentally or not, does resemble Lowe a bit), and their followup, Paths To Always, has been released. Another fine doom metal album, but unfortunately the last, as they've been reported as disbanded. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Last+Chapter">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
