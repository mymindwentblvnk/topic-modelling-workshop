An example of great integration of Ukrainian ethno instruments and modern electro-pop music, Onuka ("granddaughter") is a band created by Ukrainian musicians Yevhen Filatov and Nata Zhyzhchenko in Kyiv, Ukraine in 2013. Other group members are Daryna Sert (keyboardist and backing vocalist), Mariya Sorokina (percussionist) and Yevhen Yovenko (banduryst). The band's instrumentation includes electronic drums, trombones, French horns and Ukrainian folk instruments bandura and sopilka.

The Ukrainian word Onuka translates to "granddaughter," a tribute to lead singer Zhyzhchenko's grandfather and renowned folk-instrument maker, Oleksandr Shlionchyk. Zhyzhchenko started her music career as a member of the band Tomato Jaws, a band that she started with her brother. Tomato Jaws remained active for 11 years. Several of its songs were remixed by Filatov's band The Maneken, ultimately leading to the creation of Onuka. Lead singer Nata Zhyzhchenko believes that she can revitalize old traditions and classic folk instruments (such as the bandura and sopilka), which disappeared in the Soviet times.

Their debut album "ONUKA" was produced by The Maneken. It was released on iTunes on 15 October 2014 via Enjoy Records.

In 2017, ONUKA was featured in an interval act at the 2017 Eurovision Song Contest, performing with the NAONI folk orchestra. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Onuka">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
