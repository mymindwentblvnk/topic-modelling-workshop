An East Coast based act featuring a pedigree line-up. Included would be vocalist Jeff Fenholt, famous for his lead role in the 'Jesus Christ Superstar' stage play, former SHAKIN' STREET and BLUE CHEER guitarist Andrew 'Duck' McDonald, ex-ELF, RAINBOW, GARY MOORE and BLACK SABBATH bassist Craig Gruber and former Elf and Rainbow drummer Gary Driscoll. This band released the albums Ground Zero and, with a few other musicians, Thrasher, neither of which sold well. Driscoll found a day job, and made a little extra money on the side as a session musician.

Sadly, Driscoll would be murdered in his Ithaca, New York home in 1987. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bible+Black">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
