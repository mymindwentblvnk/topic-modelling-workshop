Piroshka is the latest project of Miki Berenyi, frontwoman of British shoegazers Lush. It’s also a UK alt-rock supergroup: Berenyi is joined by her partner, Moose’s KJ McKillop, as well as their friends, Modern English’s Mick Conroy and Elastica’s Justin Welch.

They revealed Piroshka, named after the Hungarian word for “missile” and inspired by a Hungarian folktale reminiscent of Little Red Riding Hood, in September. Today, they’ve announced their debut album Brickbat, and shared their first ever single, “Everlastingly Yours.”

Although the dreamy guitar pop guided by Berenyi’s unmistakable vocals isn’t too distant from Lush’s shoegaze, Piroshka’s sound is as elusive and heavy as their name. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Piroshka">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
