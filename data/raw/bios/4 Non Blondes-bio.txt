4 Non Blondes were an early-90s American alternative rock band. Lead vocalist Linda Perry has since released solo work and produced songs on hit albums by P!nk, Lisa Marie Presley and Christina Aguilera. The band consisted of bassist Christa Hillhouse, guitarist Roger Rocha, drummer Dawn Richardson and vocalist Linda Perry. 

4 Non Blondes had a huge hit single in 1993 with "What's Up". A year later, DJ Miko remixed the track as a dance song, and it became a hit again, on radio and in clubs. The original version of the song overshadowed the groups' other work, with them being labeled as a 'one hit wonder', but they scored significant underground success, particularly with listeners drawn to their feminist political themes.

 In 1995, 4 Non Blondes contributed the song "Misty Mountain Hop" to the Encomium tribute album to Led Zeppelin. The group also covered Van Halen's "I'm The One" for the popular slacker comedy 'Airheads'. Linda Perry went solo in 1996, and the band disbanded after recording, but not releasing, their second album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/4+Non+Blondes">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
