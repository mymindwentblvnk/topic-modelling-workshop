Sweet Valley is Nathan Williams (Wavves) side project that he has been working on with his brother Joel Williams (Kynan). Nathan explained in an interview that he had allowed Joel to come live, rent free, at his home in California, on the one condition that the two started a band together. That band would become the electronic duo 'Sweet Valley'. Previously Nathan and Kynan submitted a number of tracks to Vice that were mainly hip hop beats and experimental tracks. The duo's debut album 'Stay Calm' (Fools Gold Records) is a video game based sample piece of electronic ecstasy. Nathan was quoted as saying 'I wanted to make a soundtrack to getting drunk this summer and this is what I thought it should sound like.' So spark an L, crack a 40, and drift off to the sweet sounds of Sweet Valley.

On August 22, 2012 SV released a mixtape "Eternal Champ" that contained 13 new tracks from the duo.
