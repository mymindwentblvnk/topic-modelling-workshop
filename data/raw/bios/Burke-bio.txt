2. Burke is a singer-songwriter who mostly plays solo, accompanying himself on guitar. 

Called the love child of Axl Rose and Bob Dylan... The Burke band was formed in early '00 at an open mic night in San Francisco around the dynamic songwriting and performing talents of the enigmatic Mr. Burke Hilburn. The Burke band, comprised of Eric Mendelsohn (drummer), Bret Hagen (lead guitarist) and Brooke Lyn (bassist) added extra muscle, volume and attitude to Burke's unique and varied compositions of heartache, love, vengeance, sex and glory. Heart-wrenching, catchy songs combined with jaw-dropping, mesmerizing and booty-shaking live performances at such renowned SF venues as the Tongue & Groove and Paradise Lounge have earned the band a fanatical following in the Bay Area over the past year. At long last, Burke has released their debut full-length CD "The Year of You" for local indie label, Uncle Thrills Productions
