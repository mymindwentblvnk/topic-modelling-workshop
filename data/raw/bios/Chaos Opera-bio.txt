Chaos Opera is an unsigned one man instrumental band, with all music written and played by 'Chaos'(believed to be from Finland.). Chaos Opera's first release was the 6-track EP 'Before the Storm' in 2001.

The genres could mainly be described as instrumental black metal and progressive, with thrash metal beats.

Chaos Opera went on to release another four cds on the old mp3.com (including a "best of" compilation), the site on which they originally gained a substantial gathering of fans.

After leaving mp3.com, Chaos Opera still distribute music through lesser known mp3 sites, such as http://www2.mikseri.net/artists/chaosopera.17228.php .
Although there have been no releases since 2002, some people still regard Chaos to be active. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Chaos+Opera">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
