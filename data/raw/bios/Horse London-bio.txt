Horse London was a NWOBHM with punkish leanings formed in 1987 in London, England. Early  in1988 the first demo was recorded with Dave Goodman (Sex Pistols). The demo was completed after a few days as the session was nearly abandoned by Goodman. he following year opened with the bands first London support shows. After the courting of various record companies May 1989 saw the signing to Chrysalis and the first recording for release was rapidly undertaken. They released an EP in 1989 entitled "Diesel Power" on Chrysalis records. They did alot of gigs over their career but only released the one 6 track E.P. The album was in the shops in July and for three weeks after release was the best selling Rock album in Tower Records. Merchandising did exeptionally well through this time, holding the record for the most merchandising sold at the Marquee in one night. The band began to gain interest Stateside and signed a licensing deal in the US and everything was looking rosy. The first Transatlantic tour was planned and mapped out but by then a series of disastrous decisions had put too many holes below the waterline and the band finally sunk in 1990. It is difficult to imagine, twenty years later, the impact the band had on the UK Rock scene at the time, but adding a DIY punk ethos to their already staunch Rock credentials certainly was brave, and undoubtedly this attitude paved the way for many others.
