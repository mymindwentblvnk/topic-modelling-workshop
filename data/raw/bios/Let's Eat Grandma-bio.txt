Let's Eat Grandma are a British pop group formed in 2013 by childhood friends Rosa Walton and Jenny Hollingworth. They released their debut studio album "I, Gemini" in 2016 through Transgressive Records. Their second studio album, "I'm All Ears", was released in 2018 to widespread acclaim. Let's Eat Grandma describe their music as "experimental sludge pop".

Let’s Eat Grandma are an experimental duo from Norwich, Norfolk. Best friends since the age of four, multi-intrumentalists Rosa and Jenny create imaginative and original music that crosses the worlds of pure pop and progressive weirdness.
‘LEG’s music is neither ‘inside’ nor ‘outside’ – neither Space Lady nor Jessie J but instead exists in a liminal zone where untutored weirdness crashes up against canny pop nous, where id and superego are locked in a wildly fluctuating battle and at no point are the psychically vampiric notions of ‘cool’, ‘authenticity’ and ‘tradition’ sticking their unwanted beaks in.
They could head off in almost any direction and that’s rather thrilling.'

Their band name is taken from a grammatical joke meant to emphasize the importance of comma placement. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Let%27s+Eat+Grandma">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
