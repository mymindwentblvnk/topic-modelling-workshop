The Unsemble is a collaboration of three notable musical personalities. You may know of Duane Denison (guitar, keyboards) from his work with Tomahawk and The Jesus Lizard, among others. He's in fine form here. You might know of Alexander Hacke (bass, electronics) from his work work with Einsturzende Neubaten, Crime and the City Solution, as well as his film and production work. He's at the top of his game these days. You probably don't know of Brian Kotzur (drums, keyboards) but you should. He has worked with Silver Jews and Harmony Korine, both quite popular with hipsters, slackers, etc. He's got moves, just you wait. 
 
Recorded in the summer of 2012, these fifteen instrumental tracks are the result of an intense two week period of sonic exploration. Some are carefully composed and arranged, others are freely improvised. The moods range from calm and dreamy to agitated and chaotic.
