Call it art rock, new wave, indie rock or post-punk. No matter how you classify it, Kill Me Tomorrow creates music that hearkens the past yet maintains its own distinctly modern sound. The trio layers lots of distortion (pedals, pedals and more pedals), effects and other electronic samples with melodic guitars, hypnotic drums and haunting vocals. Kill Me Tomorrow does not hide the fact that its members are fans of Joy Division, The Fall, Sonic Youth and Velvet Underground, all of whose influences are present on the band's first EP "Chrome Yellow." Released in 2001 on local label Silver Girl Records, the album features original songs as well as remixes by members of Black Heart Procession, Three Mile Pilot, Tristeza, Album Leaf, Telefon and others. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kill+Me+Tomorrow">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
