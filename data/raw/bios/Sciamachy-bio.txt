At 20 years old, Sciamachy has begun to live out his dream in the music industry. After doing music for less than a year, he managed to work his way up making a stable income off music alone; (Almost unheard of in the music industry). Producing his own original music, Sciamachy, (or Jared Frazier), more-than-often releases tracks mixed/mastered at a virtually professional level and can only get better the more he produces. Currently, Jared Frazier co-manages a record label called, 'Unwanted Records', which was founded and established by his life-long friend and fellow artist, Brandon Wolf Hill, and him. Never letting himself get comfortable in one spot, Sciamachy is always ready to adapt and out-perform in an ever-changing industry.
