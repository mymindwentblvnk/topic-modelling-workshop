4. Detention were an awesome catchy punk band that formed in the early '80s. Their song "Dead Rock 'N' Rollers" was constantly on the punk radio stations back then. Kinda like Bedlam's "MTV", it's just a great simple punk song that can get stuck in your head quick. This CD put out by Brian of  Grand Theft Audio has the "Dead Rock 'N' Roller" EP, their LP from '85 and at least an album's worth of unreleased tracks. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Detention">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
