iamalex is a multi-genre project, moving from lo-fi hip-hop and chillout, to disco and lo-fi house. Based in Copenhagen, iamalex releases warm, cozy beats, but also likes to vibe with darker and deeper records. iamalex started his career inspired by a variety of artists like Daft Punk, The Avalanches and DJ Shadow, to mention a few. From this inspiration, he started making his own beats, which led to a variety of vinyls, cassettes and digital releases on different labels around the world. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/iamalex">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
