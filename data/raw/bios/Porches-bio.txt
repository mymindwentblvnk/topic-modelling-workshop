Porches is a solo alias of synth-centric indie singer/songwriter Aaron Maine, though at times Porches has functioned as a band. The project emerged in the early 2010s with a '90s alt-rock-derived sound that was centered on guitars and drums but also introduced spacy electronics and Maine's conspicuously yearning vocals. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Porches">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
