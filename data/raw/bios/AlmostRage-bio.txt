AlmostRage were a thrash metal band from Koper (Slovenia) active between 2004 and 2013. 

In the modern age of aggressive and bloated music in metal a shortage of simplicity, concision and uniqueness can be felt. AlmostRage, as the name implies, perform metal music with less rage and more melody. Their compositions revolve around recognition and distinction. The music ranges from fast-paced thrash riffs and rhythms to slower and catchy parts. Doing so, Edi Udovič (bass, vocals), Iztok Bajc (guitars), Bojan Sinkovič (guitars, back vocals) and Igor Marasovič (drums) try to present their ideas to a broader audience, but at the same time they do not burden themselves with reception because everything they do is done exclusively out of love for music.
