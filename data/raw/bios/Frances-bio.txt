2) "Think about the Brian Wilsons of the world, the Neutral Milk Hotels, the Captain
Beefhearts…It would be presumptuous to make such a bold statement about Paul
Hogan, who’s the mastermind behind Frances, but it doesn’t seem too far off, either. A frighteningly talented songwriter and multi-instrumentalist… he’s the kind of musical mind you don’t want to doubt." – The L Magazine
