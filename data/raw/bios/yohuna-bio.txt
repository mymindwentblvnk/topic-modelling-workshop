Aside from being the phonetic pronunciation of her given name, Yohuna [yo-HUN-ah] is the solo project of Johanne Swanson, an unsettled native of Eau Claire, WI, whose hazily brilliant music evokes the purest states of mind. With the use of a Casio keyboard, layered vocal arrangements and vehement minimal beats, she writes sedated downbeat anthems. Swansonâ€™s music is a complete reflection of herself and a passionate supplication to those close with the young artist. Sounds and lyrics drip with moody reference to past love, loss, reflection and rejection while maintaining a hopeful airy quality eagerly anticipating an uncertain future. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Yohuna">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
