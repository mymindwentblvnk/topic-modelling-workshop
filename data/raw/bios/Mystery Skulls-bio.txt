Mystery Skulls has been the funk- and soul-influenced electropop alias of Luis Dubuc since he stopped recording as The Secret Handshake in 2011. The project was originally based in Dallas, Texas, but Dubuc later relocated to Los Angeles where he currently resides.

Before signing with Warner Music, Dubuc released several promotional videos for Mystery Skulls, pairing his songs with retro footage of Star Wars, He-Man, and other classics.  Mystery Skulls gained significant online traction after an animated video was posted on Youtube using his song, "Money".

The first Mystery Skulls EP is available on Bandcamp, and more songs can be found on Dubuc's tumblr page.

Dubuc's debut studio album, Forever, was released in 2014. This release featured singles "Hellbent," "Paralyzed," and "Ghost," the latter of which received an animated music video featuring original characters. Additionally, Nile Rodgers and Brandy were featured on the tracks "Magic," and "Number 1."

The collection Ultra Rare Vol. 1 appeared on Bandcamp in 2015, featuring previously unreleased material.

"Believe," a remix of the  Jackson Sisters' "I Believe In Miracles," was released as a single in 2016.

Dubuc's second (and final) album with Warner Music, One of Us, was released in 2017. His third full-length, 2019's Back To Life, was the first LP self-published through Mystery Skulls Music. Single "Far Away" appeared in late 2019.
