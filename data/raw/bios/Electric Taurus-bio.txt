Matt and Rob formed Electric Taurus in January 2010,they change few drummers , have the privilege to play with Mino Vitelli and Chris Styne. Finally settle down with Mauro Frison on the drummer stool.

Sadly Rob left the band in May 2011 to join his sweetheart in England. Matt then took charge of the vocals and keep on writing new material and recording the final songs for their first album.
Finally James Lynch joined the band in July 2011 and the band is a three piece again.
