The Graviators formed in the woods outside Karlshamn, Sweden, with a vision to write and record music inspired by the sounds of the great rock n roll groups of the 70's. Seeing as rock n roll is dead today as we know it, the band hope to provide a spark in the dark. The Graviators blend of vintage rock with more modern stoner caught the ear of Swedish label Transubstans who signed the band in early 2009. In July the Graviators entered the Soundpalace studio (recorded by Johan and Olle Blomström) recorded by near home in Svängsta to record their self-titled debut album. Mixed and mastered by Johan Blomström (Kaptain Sun, Spice and the RJ Band, Faith ao).

Thomas Tjäder (At the Gates, In Flames, Soilwork, The Haunted etc) have made their first music video Back To The Sabbath.

The Graviators are :
Niklas Sjöberg: Vocals
Martin Fairbanks: Guitar
Johan Holm: Bass
Henrik Bergman: Drums
