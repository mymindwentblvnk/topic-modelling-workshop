What’s going on here? We know that Messiah Marcolin has just left his band CANDLEMASS once again. But the news that he is taking comfort with Swedish newcomers HER WHISPER seems to be a hoax. In fact, it didn’t say so anywhere either…The amazing thing is that the clean vocals sound identical to our big doom head.

HER WHISPER don’t play Doom, though, nor do they play Gothic, as the name implies. They rather play dark Power Metal that is often enriched by raw vocals until the Messiah voice resounds as a contrast. What the Norsemen have created here sounds damn interesting, as they boast countless catchy hooks and superb choruses. They play in a very melodic and varied repertoire, and above all, everything sounds fresh and moving. The technical level is quite high, but don’t expect any Prog Metal.
They have good ideas and the songs of HER WHISPER are fun to listen to. For me, this is a real surprise band in the newcomer department which I will keep an eye on…  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Her+Whisper">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
