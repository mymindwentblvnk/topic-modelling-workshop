Combining their wide range of musical influences and talents, A SILENT ASCENT has covered a great deal of ground in their short existence of less than 2 years. Formed in the Fall of 2007, ASA quickly released their first demo, and more recently their first EP entitled "the Last Stand," which was recorded by JTW studios. With high hopes and expectations for themselves expect to hear much more from this young band.

We're always willing to play a show with your band. Don't be shy folks, if you talk to us, we'll always respond.
