There exists more than one band with the name Gargantua:

1. Gargantua’s new music provides a mind-boggling abundance of colors, moods and compositional schemes. Dense polyphonic structures are interwoven with seemingly harmless, “mock-heroic” tunes, morphing into either jagged interplay of guitar and replicated violin, or irreverent choral enunciations, electronic soundscapes and piano staccatos.

Carnival fights here with Lent, seriousness with the grotesque, corporeality with sterility, baroque excess with ascetic introspection. This is a truly “Pantagruelian” vision of music that is self-conscious, self-mocking and highly goal-oriented. And surprising as it may sound, its intransigent, mathematical logic does not prevent the Polish artists from playing with a sharp rocky edge.

2. Rising from the swamps of Atlanta, Georgia comes Southern Viking Metal mixed with Pabst Blue Ribbon Party Rock 'N' Roll. Known locally for high energy shows that sweep the audience into a whirlwind of depravity. Gargantua is composed of musicians from such diverse acts as Super X-13, Something, Greasepaint, Fiend Without a Face, Habeus Corpsus, Truckadelic, Skid Row, The Infernals, The Luchagors and more. 

3. A Progressive Death Metal band with slighty Avant-garde Influences from Paris, France. Their members consist of Forcister Usurosae (Lead Vocals), Omnis Ishmaal (Guitar, Clean Vocals/Choirs), Silee Ishmaal (Guitar, Choirs), Porcheist Osdaal (Bass), Meijer Netylion (Keyboard and Accordions), and Ultema Obsorus (Drums/Percussions) They had released 2 studio albums. First is "La Publique" in Januray 2015, the second one is "Avant-Propos" in February 2016. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gargantua">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
