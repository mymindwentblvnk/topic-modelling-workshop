Anni Rossi is an American singer, songwriter and producer from Minnesota, currently living in Brooklyn, New York. Rossi is notable for playing an electric-viola that was handcrafted from a tree branch by former Swans percussionist Thor Harris. She adopts modern guitar and bass techniques and applies them to this instrument, as well as traditional viola styles. In recent years her music has evolved to incorporate elements of RnB and electronic music.

Having been classically trained since aged three, Rossi is an accomplished multi-instrumentalist performing as a solo artist. 

Rossi's debut album Scandia was released in 2005 by Folktale Records. 

Rossi has extensively toured both Europe and the US (including support slots with The Ting Tings and Electrelane as well as being a member of Carla Bozulich’s band). 

2010 saw the completion of her album "Heavy Meadow". 

Rossi plays with Molly Klauber, Molly Shea, Sam Mason and MGMT’s Will Berman and James Richardson in the band Acrylics.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Anni+Rossi">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
