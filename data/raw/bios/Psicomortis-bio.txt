Biography: 

Spawned from the depths pits of Hell by Lean and ex vocalist Giovanna on November 2009, Psicomortis proves to be a dark & mighty southern extreme metal band that should be listened. Lyrical and sonic inspired by war, occultism, antireligion, Thelema, ancient history, myths & legends along with a visual aggresiveness of fire and blood.
