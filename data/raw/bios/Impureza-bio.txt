Founded in 2004, by the wish from Lionelito y Lamas to build a new band influenced by iberic music, Impureza released its first demo " Y correra tu sangre", which sold out after pressing 500 copies.

Playing many local gigs and supported by devout aficionados, Impureza took another step forward with the arrival of Guillermo behind drums and the release of the second demo CD "Ruina de la penitencia". This demo has been included in the split CD "Tworziene, Resurection..." from UG label Nihilistic Holocaust - with Hellspawn (POL) and Hateful (ITA).This split CD, with its 4500 copies distributed over the world, gave Impureza fame in the metal underground via the very positive critics everywhere.

The video clip from "la checa del perverso" put the band under the lights of the media. Impureza performed many concerts in Benelux and France and played support with Gojira, Imply in All, Leng Tche (Bel), Mangled (NL), Collision (NL), Caedere (NL), and Monolith Deathcult (NL).

The release of the 3rd demo "En el desierto de la creencia," associated to a new split CD from Nihilistic Holocaust "Reincremation," gave the media confirmation that there is an "Impureza" style. It allowed the band to play with bands like Suffocation, Genital Grinder, Otargos, and Trepalium; and to play at the famous Hellfest festival in order to express their flamenca rage to a growing audience.

Impureza is actually preparing its first full length album, which will be out on Snakebite Productions in March 2008. The band is booking a tour to promote this album... <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Impureza">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
