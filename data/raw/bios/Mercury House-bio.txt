Mercury House is a 4 piece rock/metal band from Herts, UK!

In its beginning the project involved converging one evening a week to play experimental music in an attempt to push the abilities of those involved, engaging each other in constant battles of musical oneupmanship! Creating progressively intricate music! The project remained for some years as a weekly instrumental jamming sesh without either vocals or drums!

The band saw its first complete lineup in 2009 with the addition of the current vocalist and drummer and the music soon evolved past the instumental jamming it was used to and began to employ its honed musical styles into much more cohesive songwriting, thus a sound reflecting the eclectic influences of each of it's 5 members developed! 

After a few years of live jamming and local performances, the band (minus 2nd guitarist 'Gren') recorded its first studio EP in late 2011 entitled 'Against the Grain' which features newly composed songs and some of the older ideas adapted to fit the new style and sound that had emerged! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mercury+House">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
