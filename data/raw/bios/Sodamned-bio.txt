Sodamned has a history of 17 years spreading his extreme Metal in Brazil and abroad. Practicing their own way of playing Death and Black Metal by mixing these styles with other forms of Metal, Sodamned has in his discography a demo, two EPs and two albuns. Playing alive several times by the south of Brazil, the band also had the opportunity to show the power of his music to the public of the states of Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, twice in Brazilian northeastern, and also in a small European tour in 2011.
Today the band follows spreading their second full length SONGS FOR ALL AND NONE, released four years after the first album by a union with 8 Brazilian label/distros. Recorded between June / 2013 and October / 2014, this is one more work made in a partnership between the band and the producer Roger Fingle at Nitro Studio, a union that lasted since the release of the EP THE GARRET in 2007.
Sodamned takes a step forward in this new release, featuring more mature and dynamic compositions, but at no time leaving to play with his characteristic: Blackened Death Metal with a lot of melody and brutality.
The current line-up of the band is:
Juliano Regis da Silva - Guitar and Vocals
Felipe Gon√ßalves - Bass and Vocals
Eduardo Blumer - Guitar
Gilson Lange - Drums
