The artist, mainly conceptual art. He produces a lot of installations by using various materials such as texts, the materials for construction site, video, magnetic waves, living animals, bones, weapons, political declaration texts, and so on. As the extension of these works, he formed the noise performance unit "Erehwon" with Mitsushiro Hiruma in '97. He brings iron plates and springs for construction to the stage, operating contact microphone as sound sauce, and composing his original sound sculpture. The sound that traces the shadow and the ray of light in the industrial age is considered most realistic and unconsciously the most fundamental BGM for us who are living in this contemporary world.
