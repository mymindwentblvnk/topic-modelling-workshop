Hailing from Maryland, Cassandra Syndrome is a female-fronted operatic metal band. This passionate, engaging act strikes the perfect balance between playful and sinister. Cassandra Syndrome is an intimate theater of darkness and seduction.

Eschewing the synthesizer-laden stereotypes of symphonic metal, Cassandra Syndrome (formed in 2005) revolutionizes the genre with a unique blend of axe-heavy melodic metal and operatic vocals. The powerful alliance of Joe Cariola's punishing bass, scathing riffs of Jen Tonon's rhythm guitar, and throbbing beats of Jay Jericho's drums create a driving ground assault which weakens your defenses before being met by the searing lead lines of guitarist Chris Kackley. Above it all, radiant as Angelic Death, the resplendent soprano of Irene Jericho soars above the battlefield.

The band is currently touring to support their album. Past performances include Ram's Head Live, the Ottobar, Club Orpheus and The Depot in Baltimore, MD, The Asylum, Bound and DC Midnight in Washington, DC, Alley Katz in Richmond and many more. Cassandra Syndrome has also been featured in festivals at Battery Park, NY, Winchester, VA, North Andover, MA, College Park, MD and Richmond, VA.
