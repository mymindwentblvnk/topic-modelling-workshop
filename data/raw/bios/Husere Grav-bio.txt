Husere Grav is a central Texan misanthrope who has several elegantly bleak CDRs to his name.  This southern lord, operates mainly from a bedroom black metal/death drone perspective, utilizing buzzing guitar, tomb tones, and the occasional drum machine plod to convey his message of relentless misery with strange elegance. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Husere+Grav">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
