Verb T has been very productive since putting out his first record in 1999......

Verb t has been writing raps since he was 8 years old. Along the way he has worked with most of the biggest names in UK hip hop including Jehst, Sway, Harry Love and many more, as well super producer William Orbit and Edwin Collins. Verbs has a unique style and lyrical outlook not often found in hip hop music.

Heavily influenced by artists such as Slick Rick, Al Green, De La Soul, and Jimi Hendrix Verbs began developing a conversational style of rapping, covering topics of social awareness, paranoia, drug addiction and self improvement. In the late 90’s an underage Verbs hit open mic nights across London while also recording his 1st demo songs with friend and producer Harry Love. After his debut single (Ill Behaviour, ape man records 1999) and numerous appearances on mix tapes by dj’s such as M.K (kiss fm) Verbs started gaining a reputation for his “story raps” and humorous skits which showcase his deep and slightly twisted sense of humour.

In 2002 Verb t had his first release on the UK’s best known and arguable most credible hip hop label Low life records again with Harry Love (showbitchness, 2002, lowlife records). Happy with Verbs’ drive and work ethic Low Life owner Braintax invited Verb t to start recording a full length project with rapper Kashmere with whom Verbs had just started touring. The result was the critically acclaimed Backhand slap talk album (lowlife 2002) which took Verb t and Kasmere (along with producer/dj Ghost) touring all across the UK as well as dates in France, Czech Republic, Lithuania, Holland, Greece, and the USA.

The now highly sought after Verb t began featuring on albums and mix tapes in both the UK and US independent scene appearing in albums alongside acts such as Sway, Jehst, Ed O.g, Royce the 5’9”, Taskforce, Braintax, and many more.

In 2006 Verb T and Harry Love finally released their long overdue album “Bring it Back to Basics” on Silent Soundz records, regarded by many as a classic album. Verb T would follow that in 2007 with the “Broken Window” album produced by up and coming star Last Skeptik. Broken Window was again released by Silent Soundz and described by Hip Hop Connection magazine as “An illuminating snapshot of an artist gliding effortlessly towards that next level” and Metro newspaper as “proof that hip hop in the UK is evolving and expanding to more worldly topics”.

Verb T’s new album “Verbs With a Vengeance” has been described by those who have heard it as his best work to date and looks set to be a cult hit.
