Amidst the snow encrusted plains or central Canada late in the 1997 year, Nirnaeth Arnoediad came into being late one night during one of a myriad of self destruction rituals. For four years, the dark triumverat of Nirnaeth Arnoediad stood alone in the desolate prairies holding high the banner of blackened metal and hatred. In that time, the band created material for a handful of releases on a very limited scale. Finally, in early 2001, Nirnaeth Arnoediad disbanded in search of blacker puruits. The remnants of Saskatchewan's oldest black metal band have recently been compiled and put to disk for one final release simply entitled "Nirnaeth Arnoediad".
