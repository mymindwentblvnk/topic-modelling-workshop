Deep Purple is an English hard rock band that formed in Hertfordshire in 1968. They're regarded as pioneers of the popular music genre of heavy metal along such acts as Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin. Ian Gillan's singing and Ritchie Blackmore's playing approach proved to be influential to many rock bands of 1970s and 1980s (including but not limited to Rob Halford of "Judas Priest" and Brian May of "Queen"). "Deep Purple" were also very influential to progressive music as well, with their style evolving over the years and incorporating a variety of genres from art rock to blues to psychedelic rock and more.

The Early Days:
Deep Purple's early output ranged from energetic rock (such as their cover of Joe South's "Hush", which became an often broadcasted radio hit  reaching the 4th position of the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart) to Classic-like pieces ("April" from the album "Deep Purple" (1970)). One of the distinctive structural elements of their early songs were extended solo parts ("Hey Joe", "I'm So Glad"). Growing appeal for the band's composed tracks perceived as "heavy" ones brought them considerable success in the U.S., particularly with their 1968 debut album 'Shades of Deep Purple', which was unusual for English bands of the time.

After the release of the third album "Deep Purple" (unofficially referered to as "Deep Purple III", 1970), at the suggestion of a founding member and guitarist Ritchie Blackmore the singer Rod Evans and bassist Nicky Simper were released from the band on the grounds of their non-conformity with the soon-to-be-changed creative direction. The vacant places were filled by the singer Ian Gillan and bassist Roger Glover. The admission of the keyboardist Jon Lord and drummer Ian Paice completed the formation of a line-up commonly known as 'MK II' (in contrast to the previous 'MK I' with Evans and Simper). 

The first output of this revamped group was a mixed electric and orchestral album with the London Philharmonic Orchestra, 'Deep Purple in Concert', with the centrepiece being Lord's "Concerto for Group and Orchestra". The 1969 release earned some international commercial success despite its novel technique, reaching #149 on the Billboard 200 chart. The whole project was reputedly initiated after idle chat with the band's manager about the possibility led to him book the orchestra and give the inexperienced composer a deadline to produce the work of a public concert. 

Following on from this unusual venture were four very influential studio albums over the next four years: 'Deep Purple in Rock', 'Fireball, Machine Head', and 'Who Do We Think We Are?', and the live album 'Made in Japan'. Aside from earning widespread critical acclaim, the band's influence spread as many new hard rock groups looked to their sound. American audiences ate the English group up, with album after album rising up the Billboard 200 chart.
 
Though this lineup still recorded some songs with a lighter, almost pop-like tone such as "Strange Kind of Woman" and "Black Night", the influence of their new blood and the impetus this provided to the existing members pushed the band strongly in the direction of heavy rock music. Songs such as "Speed King", "Child in Time", and the massively popular "Smoke on the Water" showed the fiery spirit of the group, with Deep Purple achieving sustained international commercial success.

In 1973, creative tensions led to Gillan and Glover leaving the band, being replaced by previously unknown singer David Coverdale and ex-Trapeze bassist/singer Glenn Hughes. This new lineup continued the success of their predecessors, recording the albums Burn and Stormbringer, and further successful tours and live albums. However, Blackmore became disenchanted with the increasing funk direction he felt the band was taking and left to form Rainbow (a name inspired by the stage set when they performed at the California Jam music festival) with former members of Elf, who had previously toured with Deep Purple as a support act. 

The band recruited former James Gang guitarist Tommy Bolin and recording Come Taste the Band. It was on the 75/76 tour that the tensions within the band really came to the surface, finishing with their final performance in Liverpool in March 1976, where Coverdale resigned and the band ceased to exist. Tommy Bolin died of a heroin overdose in December 1976 whilst on tour with his solo band. 

Coverdale went on to form Whitesnake, with Paice and Lord joining Tony Ashton to form the short-lived Paice, Ashton and Lord before they too joined Coverdale in Whitesnake. Hughes completed a solo album but spent most of the 70s and 80s fighting drug addiction which he finally overcome in the 90s and has since produced a string of solo albums. 

Back again (MK II the 2nd): 
In 1984, Deep Purple's best-known second lineup (Ian Gillan, Jon Lord, Ian Paice, Roger Glover, and Richie Blackmore) reunited to produce the albums Perfect Strangers and The House of Blue Light. Tensions returned however, and Gillan was fired and replaced by Joe Lynn Turner, formerly of Rainbow. This lineup only lasted for one album, Slaves and Masters, before Ian Gillan returned again for The Battle Rages On. Blackmore subsequently departed the band for good while touring in support of this album, being temporarily replaced by Joe Satriani. During this time, many archival live albums of the original Deep Purple lineup were released, such as Scandinavian Nights (a 1988 release of a 1970 concert) and King Biscuit Flower Hour (a 1995 release of two 1976 concerts) 

The remaining members recruited Dixie Dregs/Kansas guitarist Steve Morse and, revitalised, produced what many regarded as their best work in many years, Purpendicular, then Abandon before Lord retired and was replaced by former Rainbow and Ozzy Osbourne keyboardist Don Airey. This lineup has since recorded the albums Bananas and Rapture of the Deep. 

While not as influential or commercially successful as in their original incarnation, the band have remained a successful studio and live act throughout this latest period.
