The brain-child and solo project of Danny White, The Oddyssey blends different genres and aspects of music into a progressive mix of rock and metal. The 2010 d√©but album, 'The Journey', is the first instrumental release consisting of a single 29 minute composition broken into 6 definable sections. 


  As of recent The Oddyssey is solely a solo project, although welcomes the prospect of playing live.
