Triggerfinger is a Belgian rock band from Antwerp, Belgium, formed in 1998 with an international sound which appeals to both younger people, who recognize Queens Of The Stone Age and old rockers, who are reminded of Led Zeppelin. Triggerfinger receives rave reviews from the media. One such review claims Triggerfinger's live show makes about 500,000 other so-called rock bands instantly redundant.

Triggerfinger consists of three talented musicians: singer/guitarist Ruben Block (Sin Alley and Angelico), bassist Paul van Bruystegem - aka lange Polle / Monsieur Paul - who still plays with BJ Scott and drummer Mario Goossens (Noordkaap, Monza, Hooverphonic, and many others). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Triggerfinger">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
