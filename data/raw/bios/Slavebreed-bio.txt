Slavebreed is a band from Athens, Greece, playing a mixture of grindcore and death metal with some crust / hardcore influences. They were formed in late 2004 by Pavlos and Kostas, from the remains of Pavlos' older deathcore side-project band ("Scorned" mcd, 2001).

Slavebreed recorded a 4-track live rehearsal mini-cd in early 2007, receiving positive feedback and less than one year later recorded their first full length album, "Pain Syndicate", released under L'Inphantile Collective (Czech Republic, 2008).

"Pain Syndicate" received great reviews worldwide and soon after its release Slavebreed hit the road, performing live on a number of tours all around Europe, sharing the stage with bands such as Napalm Death, Fear Factory, Entombed, Doom, Ratos de Porao, Birdflesh, Afgrund, Warcollapse, Mumakil, Rotten Sound, Severe Torture and many others.

On 2011 a 7” split was released with Hibernation and “Dog Eat Dog” cover was recorded for the Disrupt tribute compilation, soon to be released from Power It Up records (Germany).

In the summer of 2012 Slavebreed released their second full-length album, "Dethrone the Architect", under L'Inphantile Collective (CZ) and Noise Attack (GR). A mini tour is scheduled for late August 2012 to support the release, which will contain 2 open-air festivals (Fekal Party 14 and Arschcholio 10), as well as 6 more shows in Central Europe.
