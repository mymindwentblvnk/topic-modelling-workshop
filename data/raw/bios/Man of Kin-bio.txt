Man Of Kin are a 5 piece Groove/Thrash Metal band from West London. The band was founded by Jaz Oberoi (Vocals) who has previously worked on projects such as Discord, MoonRabbit and Zocalo. Rhythm guitar is provided by Jon Coakley. Aaron Waddingham is the lead guitarist with experience with bands such as Kyrb Grinder and Land Of Cain. Carl Stanley (Bass) has played with Jaz for many years in bands such as MoonRabbit and Zocalo. The band found missing link Rob Halliday on drums... a man who brings a creative direction as a drummer that completes the music in a way the band never envisaged happening.
Man Of Kin was complete in July 2008, having already had signature track "Primitive" played on Sky TV live as UWC Heavyweight Champion Stav Economou's entrance at Cage Rage 27, having been interviewed live on Total Rock and having played The Islington Academy alongside bands such as Breed 77, Evile, Pitchshifter, Exit Ten, This is Menace, for a band that's literally been completed for moments, the band is already being thrust into the limelight.
Man Of Kin recently played a 6 month anniversary show to a crowded O'Neills in Ealing, with the E.P due for completion by the end of January 2009, Man Of Kin will be returning to O'Neills for the E.P launch in front of their home town.
Man Of Kin have now shot a video of Primitive courtesy of the Fight Channel which will be out as soon as the E.P is recorded at Ealing Studio's in January. The band will also be receiving coverage on BBC and Sky TV in the upcoming months. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Man+Of+Kin">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
