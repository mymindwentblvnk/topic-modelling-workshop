5) There is a fire spreading, and it’s not the one you picked up at the strip club last week. It’s four dudes that will make you punch your best friend in the face and kiss their significant other. It’s a bottomless bottle of good music meant to be chased with better booze. Combining the fierceness and fun of that good old devil music with the calming nature of your pastor’s acoustic, they will rip through any rocker with a ferocious face-melting vengeance and then steal their girl with an acoustic cover of The Weeknd. If you believe bad decisions make for good memories then raise a glass and pass the grass, because this is Wild Fire.

     Their debut album, “Revolt” displays a range of sonic power utilizing aggressive and emotional vocals backed by haunting classical instruments, dynamic guitars, a high-powered rhythm section, topped off with their signature piano to craft an exceptional hard rock sound. “Villain,” the lead single from “Revolt,” has gained over 20 million streams worldwide and reached #82 on the Mediabase Rock Charts.

     In their natural live environment, Wild Fire creates an atmosphere that seduces their crowds and commands their attention through a barrage of chaotic and unapologetic raw energy where crowd participation is required.  Their live production includes a custom built piano, designed to double as a platform to “heighten” the performance. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wild+Fire">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
