Piers Faccini (born Piers Damian G. Faccini; 1970) is an English singer, painter and songwriter. 

Faccini began his music career in London in the band 'Charley Marlowe', which he fronted alongside the poet Francesca Beard. In 2001, the band ended and Piers started solo work. He writes music for television - notably the BBC docudrama 'Killing Hitler' - as well as painting. His first solo album and EP 'Leave No Trace' came out in 2004.

He has guested on a series of other albums some of which are released on the 'Label-Bleu' label.

His style is rhythmic and melodic. His album is mostly based around acoustic guitar riffs, whereas his earlier music and TV themes reflect his interest in dance music.

He is currently based in France.
