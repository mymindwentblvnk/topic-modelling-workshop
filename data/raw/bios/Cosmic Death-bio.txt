Black/Thrash Metal project with Andreas Hedlund (from Vintersorg and Otyg fame), Crille Ljungblad and Fredde Lindberg. 
They only released one demo which was called 'Crimson Nightgate' in 1997 before splitting up. Recently, Crille and Fredde raised the project again but Vintersorg is not a part of Cosmic Death anymore. Their upcoming demo will contain old songs from 1997 that were never recorded and two new songs.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cosmic+Death">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
