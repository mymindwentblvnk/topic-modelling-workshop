Damn the Machine was a short-lived progressive rock/metal band founded by ex-Megadeth guitarist Chris Poland.

After leaving Megadeth in 1987, guitarist Chris Poland recorded a solo album in 1990 (Return to Metalopolis). Three years later, he resurfaced with the group Damn the Machine (DTM), which included his brother Mark on drums, as well as Dave Clemmons on vocals/guitar, and David Randi on bass. While the group was indeed heavy, their sound was slightly more progressive than Poland's previous band, perhaps more comparable to the likes of Queensryche and Fates Warning but with a jazzier twist and politically charged lyrics.

The band signed a deal with A&M records in 1993, and their self-titled debut album was released the same year. It was recorded & produced by Brian Malouf (known for his work with among others Pearl Jam, Queen, Extreme, Madonna, Michael Jackson, Lisa Loeb and Jean-Luc Ponty). The band toured with Dream Theater in Europe, and in North America with Voivod, Flotsam & Jetsam, and Excel.

DTM was not widely embraced by the alternative-minded consumer, and receiving less and less support from A&M, had their recording contract cancelled and eventually called it quits. Dave Clemmons departed the group, and with a new singer the remaining members reformed as Mumbo's Brain. (The latter can be heard on Chris Poland's release - Rare Trax from 2000).

Dave Clemmons later resurfaced in a band called Jud, while Chris Poland became a member of the jazz-fusion outfit OHM:.  Mark Poland works with his own musical project, and rumor has it that Dave Randi now works for Playboy magazine.

    * Chris Poland - lead and rhythm guitars, background vocals
