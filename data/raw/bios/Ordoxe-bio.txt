Old school black metal from Trois-Rivieres, Quebec, Canada.

Raised from the ashes of SLAOTVEAN, ORDOXE has now become the main 
project of guitarist/singer JF Jalbert, supported by guitarist Samuel 
Landry (Horfixion), bassman JD Bergeron and drummer Steve De Cotret 
(Strigampire). Created in 1990, this solo project has been quickly 
pulled aside due to lack of time and the growing popularity of 
SLAOTVEAN. ORDOXE presents a darker sound. Providing grim moods and 
evil ambiences. And this moment is 2013. SLAOTVEAN is now dead. ORDOXE is now rising with fierce and might.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ordoxe">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
