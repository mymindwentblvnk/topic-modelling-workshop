[b/]Paul Pritchard is a British composer and musician. He spent many years sitting in orchestras - mainly the London Symphony Orchestra - holding a French Horn. Perhaps that accounts for the rich, melodic strain in his writing. He later became a session player working in films and television. Using Gustav Holst’s maxim that ‘the best way to use an orchestra is to be part of one’, Paul set about writing. In a relatively short career as a composer, he has penned more than 24 hours of music for drama, two co-written with Elvis Costello, has written for a feature film and for documentaries including a series presented by a certain Edward Windsor of Windsor Castle fame. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Paul+Pritchard">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
