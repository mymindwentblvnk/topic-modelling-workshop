The Comet Is Coming is a British band formed in London in 2013 that incorporates elements of jazz, electronica, funk and psychedelic rock. The band's debut album, Channel the Spirits, was nominated for the 2016 Mercury Prize 

The band's combination of Shabaka Hutchings' short, repetitive, staccato tenor sax phrases, Dan Leavers' keyboards and swooshing electronics, and Max Hallett's powerhouse drumming creates an energetic mix of jazz, techno and dance influences with some hard-hitting grooves.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Comet+Is+Coming">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
