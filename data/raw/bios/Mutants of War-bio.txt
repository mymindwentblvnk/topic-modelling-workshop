Coming out of Chino, CA, a small city on the edge of LA, Orange and San Bernardino counties, Mutants of War is an aggressive, talented and incredibly dynamic thrash metal group. Formed by close friends in late 2007, Mutants of War has since matured as individuals and musicians. Several line up changes have only strengthened the band; introducing a broad spectrum of personality and influence; forging a unique sound that has no formula. Never afraid to be serious or ashamed to be absurd and never content with one direction.

With a debut EP, now on sale internationally, under their belt and armed with three years of constant gigging experience, Mutants of War is determined to expand on their trademark melodic sound and overthrow the generic; spreading their music as far as they can through high energy performances. With fans from Escondido to Japan, Mutants of War is poised to take over the world.
