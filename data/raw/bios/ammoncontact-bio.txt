Ammoncontact is a duo, Carlos Ni単o & Fabian Ammon Alston, originally from Los Angeles, USA

Heavy, funky, groove-based minimalism with a dash of cosmic Black Power politics, a love of jazz and enough bass to flatten planets - that's the Ammoncontact formula. Although to call it a formula is to deny just how many different shapes "instrumental hip hop" can be squeezed and formed into over 34 minutes. "Omniverse" parts 1 and 2 are examples of Ni単o's hybrid production style, which fuses drum machine programming, sampling, live instrumentation and voices. "Futuro" and "A Satelitte's Return" are classic cut-em-up, sample-chop constructions by Fabian Ammon that Ni単o arranges with a film editor's eye for the cinematic. "Naeem" (named for Ammon's new son) is a clear-eyed afro-funk shuffler. "My People" sees the return of Lil Sci (originally of Scienz of Life) dropping consciousness over a marimba-driven beat, while "Temple Jam" feature's another Ni単o project, the big band Build An Ark.

Ammoncontact once again prove the power of simplicity, of the working man's virtues of craft and knowhow over hype and inflated ego. And, of course, of the groove, of constant rebirth through rhythm. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ammoncontact">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
