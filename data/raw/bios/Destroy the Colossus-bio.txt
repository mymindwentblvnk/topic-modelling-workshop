Hailing from California's Bay Area hardcore scene, Destroy The Colossus first emerged with their previous moniker, Turok, in 2006.  

Swaying from the conventional path, Turok aimed to bring a brutal mix of genres emphasizing on technical metal, but never forgetting the crushing breakdowns that we all love.  With a new line-up, a slight change in style, and a realization of potential legal woes, Turok changed their name to Destroy The Colossus to further reflect their evolving musicianship.  

Since the beginning of 2008, Destroy The Colossus has been gearing up to push their musical limits even further and bring to fans a mind-crushing tour de force of bludgeoning destruction that will leave fans satisfied but better yet begging for more and with the latest release of their self produced full length, “Centuries”, fans may just get more than they bargained for.
