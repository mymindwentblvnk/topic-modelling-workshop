TWINSPIRITS is the latest step in Daniele Liverani’s career.
This project comes with the purpose of creating a band that really can break through in progressive music world!
During his musical trips, Daniele gathered throughout years the suitable elements that could fit his designs.
Human engine Dario Ciccioni on drums, guitar prodigy Tommy Ermolli, bass talent Alberto Rigoni and the raw voice power singer Søren Adamsen besides obviously to the mastermind keyboard player Daniele.
It all started when Daniele met Dario rehearsing on his drums in a recording studio. The meeting gave shape to the three episodes of Daniele’s Genius Rock Opera. Some years later, another important fact happened: Daniele and Dario saw Tommy playing some Vai/Satriani tunes and decided to come in touch with this young (he was just 14!) talented guitar player. After a few months, the “core” was complete when the band chose Alberto (progressive bass player of ASCRA, DREAM THEATER cover band).
After many auditions of great singers of the international scene (including Gøran Edman, Terry Ilous and many others) they found the best matching voice in Søren Adamsen for his incredible versatility and powerful style.
The first studio album called “The Music That Will Heal The World” was released on Lion Music in June 2007 with worldwide distribution.TWINSPIRITS debut album is a rich progressive metal package full of melody and more accessible than many progressive metal albums.The attention to the song is evident right from the first listen yet there is more than enough virtuoso musicianship to keep even the most demanding progressive metal fanatic satisfied.Get ready to face the new Prog experience.
Highly recommended to all progressive metal fans. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Twinspirits">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
