Excrecor; Formed in 2000, a New Hampshire based melodic death metal quartet out of the small town of Hampton Falls. They combine a marriage of Scandinavian and progressive death metal, with deep atmospheric elements. Excrecor's sound continues to push forward with every release while sticking to the roots of their music as a whole. Their debut release; a four song self-produced E.P. titled “Synchronicity”, captured a great sample of what the band has to offer and is available for free! In 2011, fans will see the first full length album from Excrecor titled “Hypnotic Affliction” and will be as widely available as possible! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Excrecor">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
