Black Cat Music came together in the summer of 1998. Blending modern rock n' roll, garage and punk, they captured a loyal and fiery fan base through touring and incredible live shows. The band members have an eclectic history from which to draw. One was a gravedigger, another tended bar for the rich and famous and down and out. One is a club DJ and yet another can tell you all there is to know about the solitary life of a snowplow driver. Brady Baltezore, Travis Dutton, Omar Perez and Denny Martin are four odd characters who come together to create some of the most cohesive, interesting and explosive music around. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Black+Cat+Music">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
