DreadLord is a Danish Death metal band formed by guitarist Anders Nissen, drummer Christian Kaiser and vocalist Christian Hansen in 2005. We released Our first demo “Shades of Hiroshima” in 2006. 
Old school Death Metal, a mix between heavy slowly riff and fast riff was the main idea for DreadLord in the early years with the S.o.H demo. Later in 2007/2008 the band members choose to split up and go separate ways.
In 2008 Anders and Christian H. hooked up with guitarist Christian Christiansen and drummer Pete Olsen and soon after Christian H. left for personal reasons.
Both guitarist Anders Nissen and Christian Christiansen felt the need to create a more brutal death metal and make a fresh start.
Inspired by bands such as Nile, Dying Fetus, Cannibal Corpse, Suffocation, Origin & Bolt Thrower, they decided to form a band that was aggressive, brutal and most importantly had its own sound as DreadLord. They were soon joined by vocalist Mathias Junge, who took upon the role to write lyrics suitable for the music. When it came to the fast and brutal style the band was heading for, Drummer Pete Olsen could not perform and left the band. A mutual friend suggested us to call drummer Mads Lauridsen, when he met up with the rest of the band to try out, he found he had similar music tastes and joined immediately. 
After Having played several gigs with bass player Thomas Fisher (Defilementory/Rotting Hope) the band needed a full member to fill in the bass parts and Thomas introduced Mike to the band. 
Mike turned out to be perfect for DreadLord and had his live debut at Sick Fest 2012.
After the departure of our drummer and singer, do to lack of time, we have teamed up with Danni on drums, and Søren on vocals.
