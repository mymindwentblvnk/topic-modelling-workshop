Freak Kitchen is a heavy metal/hard rock band from Gothenburg, Sweden, formed in 1992. The high technical level of their compositions usually makes people refer to their style as somewhat of a progressive metal or progressive rock band.

Freak Kitchen's style of music is influenced by many genres besides the traditional heavy metal, ranging from jazz to pop. The band described their third album as "A corny little heavy-pop-rock-latin-world-jazz-avant-garde-metal-blues-record".

Lyrics contain heavy criticism against capitalist society, conformity, racism and the attitude of huge record companies.

Frontman Mattias IA Eklundh is widely known as a guitarist of high technical ability, and live shows often contain parts where Eklundh plays the guitar using several foreign objects such as a vibrating dildo. Eklundh has also released three solo albums, Sensually Primitive (1997) (under the pseudonym Mr. Libido), Freak Guitar (1999) and The Road Less Traveled (2004).
