A South Texas psycha-metal march through the veins of music type thing with hotsauce.

Destroyed By Voices was conceived on 2nd Street and Lott in Kingsville, Texas back in 2003 and is more commited now then ever to creating music indefinately. Together Jason Perez, Elio Ramirez, and Jake Camarillo made the journey across Texas state lines until they reached Los Angeles. Settling into the undesirable end of Laurel Canyon Blvd., they holed themselves up in a small apartment and began writing and rehearshing what would become Riots In Paradise. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Destroyed+by+Voices">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
