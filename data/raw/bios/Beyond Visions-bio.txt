Beyond Visions is a Gothic metal band from Stockholm, Sweden and was formed in 2007.

Though they've been active since 2007, they've not been signed to a label and theyâ€™ve had a hard time publishing their materials. During their two first years they released two demos, "End of the Beginning" in 2007 and "Demo 2008" in 2008.

After that an EP was scheduled to be released in 2008, but as they'd problems getting signed and getting it out to stores, it was delayed until 2010, "IV: Ex Animo". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Beyond+Visions">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
