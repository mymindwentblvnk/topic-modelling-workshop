Jenny Lee Lindberg (b. July 30, 1981) is an American musician, singer-songwriter and record producer, best known as the bassist of the indie rock band Warpaint. Lindberg had a "chance encounter" with Emily Kokal during one of Shannyn Sossamon's DJ sets soon after relocating to Los Angeles and formed Warpaint with her, Theresa Wayman and Shannyn on Valentine's Day 2004. Originally rehearsing and composing original material alone for 18 months, Warpaint then began performing regularly in Los Angeles and self-released their debut extended play, Exquisite Corpse, in August 2008.
Lindberg's debut solo album Right On! was released in November 2015. Featuring elements of new wave and gothic rock, the album was produced by Lindberg with Norm Block and features Warpaint drummer Stella Mozgawa.
