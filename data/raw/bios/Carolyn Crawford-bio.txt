Carolyn Crawford is from Detroit, Michigan.  In the early sixties, Motown ran a local contest for local artists.  The winner got a three single deal with the company.  Carolyn Crawford was a winner of that contest in 1963 or 1964 (whoever else won, I'll leave to others).  She did "My Smile is Just a Frown", "When Someone's Good to You", and "Forget About Me" as the lead 3 singles.

Never receiving the attention or promotion of larger acts, Crawford left Motown in 1965. She briefly returned to music as a background vocalist and occasional producer of minor disco hits in the 1970s. Crawford was a vocalist on Hamilton Bohannon's 1978 hit "Let's Start The Dance", as well as many albums for Bohannon. To return the favour, Bohannon produced two solo albums for Caroline, "My Name Is Caroline" being the first. In 1989 she joined Ian Levine's Motorcity project and recorded the album Heartaches including the single "Timeless" which later became a favourite on the UK Northern soul circuit <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Carolyn+Crawford">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
