Cleanup is an Experimental/Progressive Rock band from Fort Worth, TX. Their goal is to create a sound that presents a truly unique experience, while still reflecting reminiscent elements of music from past eras in a way that both satisfies them, while delighting music lovers alike. The band has evolved over the past two years, experimenting with numerous members and finally solidifying in the spring of 2011 with Landon Cabarubio (Guitar/Keyboard), Brad Cannon (Vocals/Guitar), Kyle Harding (Bass/Vocals/Keyboard), and Riley Pennock (Drums). 

Steve Watkins of DFW.com writes, “Some bands I have to warm up to, but these guys won me over right off the bat with killer jazz/prog rock instrumental sound that woke up the room. Harding's bass work is phenomenal; and while I am most familiar with Landon's keyboard work… his guitar leads were at once frantic, precise and tastefully done”, Watkins goes on to say, “There are a lot of musicians that can play fast, but it's rare to find a band so unbelievably tight and intricate."
