She The Murderess was formed in 2005 by original members Rich Anthony, Brendan Chambers, Brendan Walsleben, and Dan Cacioppo. The band recorded two demo songs with this line-up and played a handful of local shows with an unstable line-up of second guitarists and bassists. After a few line-up changes and the departure of Brendan Chambers, the band finally settled on a steady line-up featuring the additions of Tim Lachman and Matt Ferri in the winter of 2005/2006. The band recorded a four-song self-titled EP (self released and later reissued by CSC records) with this line-up, spending much of the following summer touring in support of the EP with the band bynomeans. The band then took a break to focus on writing new material and welcomed back Brendan Chambers after the break-up of his band Claret Scare. After playing a few shows with this line-up, Matt Ferri left to focus on his other band, Trasher, and STM welcomed Keith Krupinski (formerly of Trasher and Claret Scare) to the line-up. The band is currently writing a new record and sporadically playing shows as its members focus on school and work full-time, as well as a few other musical endeavours. A new album should be completed by summer of 2008, with release information TBA.
