1. Cherub is a sexy, avant-garde, electro-pop duo that is the dance love-child of 80â€™s funk, and pop-music from the future. The members of Cherub, Jordan Kelley and Jason Huber, share a love for honest original music and vibrant live performance, with a common goal to share a little bit of sex, a little bit of drugs, and a whole lot of love with people across the globe. They hail from Murfreesboro, TN.

3. Cherub is an alternative metal band from Kingston, Ontario, Canada. The band's earliest days were as an instrumental alternative band beginning in 2005.  Since then they have had a few lineup changes, and have had a solid lineup since late 2007. 

Now with a determined and eager musical work ethic and influence drawn from almost every angle of the musical spectrum, Cherub is producing unique, and high energy experimental metal, juxtaposed with their characteristic brand of dense layered melodies and hooks, tweaked from years of playing without a singer.
