The music of Pyramid Theorem has been influenced by the sounds of bands like Rush, Yes, Symphony X, Ozzy  and Dream Theater.  The quality of musicianship demonstrated by these bands has served to inspire and ignite a passion within each member to individually create their own brand of music, that when fused together, produces the original progressive metal/rock sound of Pyramid Theorem.

Formed in 2006 and originating in Richmond Hill, Ontario, the band members consist of Vito DeFrancesco (drums), Sam Ermellini (guitar), and brothers Stephan Di Mambro (guitar, synthesizer, vocals) and Christian Di Mambro (bass).

The epic sound consisting of melodic riffs, quick time changes, impressive and skillfully executed guitar solos showcase Pyramid Theorem’s natural talent and versatility, offering a range of styles and sounds as evidenced in their demo CD, Voyage to the Star.

“It’s incredibly gratifying  when the individual pieces we’ve created in our jam sessions come together to produce a composition we’re extremely proud of…and the fact that there are people out there who like it, is awesome!”

Leading up to the release of Voyage to the Star, Pyramid Theorem band members honed their skills and on-stage performance by headlining many shows in Toronto, Ontario playing at venues such as The Opera House, Reilly’s Pub, and Kathedral.  The countless hours spent practicing and perfecting their sound paid off in June 2008, when the band placed first in the Rock ‘n Race Battle of the Bands competition at Downsview Park in Toronto.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pyramid+Theorem">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
