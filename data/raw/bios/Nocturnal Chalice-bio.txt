Nocturnal Chalice was an expression of pure elitism, unsatisfied with the modern black metal scene, seeking to go back to something more pure and more honest. Formed in Glasgow, Nocturnal Chalice, as an entity, released a trilogy of demos through Tour De Garde, and then, as quickly as it emerged, it retreated back to the shadows, leaving three demos of hatred as a monument to its glory.   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nocturnal+Chalice">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
