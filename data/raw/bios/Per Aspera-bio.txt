There is more than one artist with this name:

1. Per Aspera seamlessly blends eerie industrial atmosphere with serene harmonies of almost orchestral form. Cinematic, monstrous drone formations morph into pulsating abyss of dissonant disturbances and uncompromised sonic experiments, overlaid by subtle beauty of human voice and minimalist acoustic instrumentation. 

"Lucid, outdistanced yet engrossing terrorâ€“art full of treats. Per Aspera manages to intrigue with harmonious abundance of grey shade spectrum, and is capable of riveting all of your attention to the loudspeaker system, in front of which you await next allurements of that undoubtfully luxuriant soundscape imagination." - as reviewed by Eliks on postindustry.org

All Per Aspera releases are produced and distributed by www.newnihilism.com.

2. Post-black metal/blackgaze from Sisak, Croatia
