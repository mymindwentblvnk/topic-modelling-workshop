Centiment are a Progressive Rock/Metal band from Brentwood, Essex who were formed in 2000 by Greg McPherson.  

Greetings Earthlings. After nearly 4 years of construction our debut album Streets of Rage is ready to be unleashed upon your head holes. 

Formed of InMe's Dave McPherson, Greg McPherson & Gazz Marlow plus the wonderfully adept Neil Howard & Mark Shurety, we've created a monstrous abomination that we'd like to share with music lovers worldwide. We've poured blood, sweat & tears into the creation of a metal album that attempts to explore unknown areas of the universe of sound. Dave McPherson & InMe have used the (frankly astounding) PledgeMusic platform for the last couple years & it's the obvious choice for Streets of Rage. 

We're an independent band with a DIY work ethic & this is the perfect way for us to accompany a hands on approach. It is our mission to ensure that all pledgers come away from this campaign knowing they've got such a richer experience than they'd get from a conventional album release. 

All pledgers will receive our entire back catalog, exclusive videos, blogs & loads more stuff on top of being a part of us helping to launch a sonic creation we couldn't be more proud of. Also, after the target has been reached, 5% of all funds raised will go to the Love Hope Strength Foundation which promotes innovative, music related, outreach and awareness programmes for leukemia and cancer sufferers, survivors and their families. 

Thank you so much for being part of our beginning. Let's play... Centiment.
