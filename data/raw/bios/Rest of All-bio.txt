The Band has founded by three members of dispended Internal Conflict; Akın Birol (Lead Guitar) , Görkem Baysal (Drums) and Sercan Yaşar (Vocal) in October 2006.

After foundation of the group, the band started to look after for a new Rhythm Guitarist and Bass Guitarist while and in this period of time the three continued to improve their studio and solve the problems about isolation and equipment shortages.

Rest Of All formed their first line-up After Volkan Kapancı’s participation as the Rhytm Guitarist and after a few concerts they started to focus on their own songs in their own sudio. And the first songs of the group Geriye Kalan & Ego was written then. While the group was looking for a Bass Guitarist, the Rhytm Guitarist of the dispended band Internal Conflict joined the group as the Bass Guitarist.

At september, 2008, Volkan Kapanci left the group for another musical projects. For a while, Rest Of All, searched for a second guitarist, but after that, they decided to go on with single guitar.

Although the musical style of the group seems to be under influence of  Thrash Metal, Melodic Death Metal, Metalcore, the members are not bound to a style, and they want to express themselves free without having any obligation about any type of music. And they are fighting for this…
