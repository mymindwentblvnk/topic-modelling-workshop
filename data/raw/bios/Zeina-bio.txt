Warm, open and grounded, Montreal based dj, producer and promoter Zeina makes music that is expressive and as creative as she is.

She combines intellect and feeling to produce a uniquely feminine, understated and occasionally darker minimal groove—yet one that’s filled with all the warmth and sensuality of the culture of her Arabic roots and current environment.

Sometimes heavy, always smooth – her sets breathe life into a room – effortlessly offering her dance floor an environment from which to let go into the sound and inside themselves.

Causing trouble with homebase Hushlamb crew since 2008, and more recently under the Brain & Booty moniker, Zeina has her hands full as a working dj, producer and promoter in Montreal, staying focused on delivering an environment that allows for the expression of unique sound.

Expect to hear and feel more from Zeina in the years to come. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Zeina">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
