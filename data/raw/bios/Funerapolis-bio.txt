Funerapolis is from Bergen and started up early in 2005. After several line-up changes and small progress, the band found their current line-up in March 2006. With new and eager band-members, Funerapolis seemed to have found a stabile line-up. In the beginning the style was more or less heavy metal, but during 2006 Funerapolis gradually changed to be a heavier and doomier act, ending up finding their musical identity. 
During the spring of 2007 Funerapolis finished recording a 6-track CD called 'Demonized' at Conclave & Earshot studio with producer Bjørnar E. Nilsen. 'Demonized' can be described as doom metal with fragments of rock 'n heavy. The riffs are slow and melodic, and the lyrics are gloomy with a reek of sulphur and dark fantasies.
