Vladislav Delay Quartet is the group of Finnish experimental artist Sasu Ripatti, who is most often known under his moniker Vladislav Delay. The group released their self-titled debut album in 2011. 

Ripatti has always been a man of many projects, producing on his own as Vladislav Delay, Luomo, Uusitalo and Sistol, with each guise differing greatly in style. Other members of the line-up are Sähkö mainstay Mika Vainio (a.k.a. Ø), who handles electronics and processing, and live instrumentalists Derek Shirley on double bass and Lucio Capece (who also appeared on the Vladislav Delay's 2009 album Tummaa) on bass clarinet and soprano sax. 

The sound of the quartet is a mixture of noise, dark ambient and avant-garde jazz. It has a few things in common with the Moritz von Oswald Trio: both are an electro-acoustic ensemble with Ripatti on percussion and are released through Honest Jon's Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vladislav+Delay+Quartet">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
