Mookerdam is a gritty doom outfit based out of Los Angeles. Forming in a surplus store on Hollywood blvd (and practicing in the basement) in late 2007, They have continued to reform and remold their basement sound into further recesses of the underground. 

Releasing their first (self recorded/self released) album "Shadow of Mokerdam" in 2008. The band sold most copies out of the very shop they practiced at. Others were sent away never to be seen or heard of again. 

After 2 years of hiding, playing, and substances the band has released a 4 track EP entitled "Impenitence" in the cold days of early 2010. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mookerdam">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
