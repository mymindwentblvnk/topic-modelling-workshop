The simple combination of Baldwin's bass and singing is pure, direct, and timeless.

Today, when most of the so-called musical innovators simply offer contemporary takes on already proven and accepted movements in music (neo-psychedelia, nth-wave garage bands...) Portsmouth, New Hampshire's Nat Baldwin is a true original. Baldwin is an upright bass player and a singer, but he takes both of those things to their limit, and has perfected a sound that he can call entirely his own.

Trained under free jazz master Anthony Braxton, Nat is involved with Dirty Projectors and his song "Only In My Dreams" from his Lights Out CD EP is featured in a new Orange ad (in the UK). It looks like the world is starting to give Mr. Baldwin the attention he deserves. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nat+Baldwin">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
