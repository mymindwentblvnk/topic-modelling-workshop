1) From the wasteland of the South, Dead City has emerged as a new force in heavy metallic hardcore. Deliberately conjuring the spirit of an era of hardcore and metal that many consider to be a part of the past, Dead City draws influence from bands like Entombed, Crowbar, Integrity, and Damnation AD, while maintaining a sound that is completely distinct. Turning a blind eye to the status quo of the hardcore scene of today, this Memphis/Little Rock based band represent the bleakness and desolation of their locale, facing the absurdity of the human condition with clenched fists and bared teeth.

2) Dead City is a punk band from Connecticut featuring ex-members of hardcore punk band Lost Generation. To date they have put out one album which features Cheetah Chrome of the Dead Boys on guitar. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dead+City">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
