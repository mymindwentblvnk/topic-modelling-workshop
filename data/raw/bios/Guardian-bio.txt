There are five artists with this name:
1) Guardian was formed in 1982 by bassist David Bach, vocalist Paul Cawley, and and drummer, Rikk Hart. They originally named themselves "Fusion" and added David Caro on guitars. They were signed to Enigma records in 1985 and changed their name to Gardian, soon after replaced Caro with Tony Palacios on guitar. They released two demos under the Gardian name called Fusion (released 1984) and Voyager (released 1987). Their debut album "First Watch" was released in 1989 under the final name change "Guardian", but shortly after Cawley and Hart left the band due to the rigors of non-stop touring. 

In 1990, Cawley was replaced by Jamie Rowe (formerly of "Tempest") as the new vocalist and Hart was replaced by Karl Ney on drums. This lineup remained consistant throughout their last English studio album "Bottle Rocket" in 1997. However, in 2002 Guardian released "Dime", their 3rd Spanish effort, yet with all new material. David Bach could not be a part of this album due to time constraints. Their 1993 album "Miracle Mile" was their most popular commercially successful album.
In the words of Jamie Rowe, "There will be another Guardian album." Let's hope so.
