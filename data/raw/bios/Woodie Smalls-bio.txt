Young Woodie Smalls (1996), aka Woods, started making music at the early age of 15. At first it wasn't something that he took real serious. Being in the studio was more about fun and hanging out with the homies. When his cousin Grey and childhood friend K1D started to give him props and asking for more verses things started to change. Woods became more focussed on producing quality content and started working towards his first official EP release. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Woodie+Smalls">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
