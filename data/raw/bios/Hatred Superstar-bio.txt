Spring 2010: HATRED SUPERSTAR was born in the suburbs of Marseille (France).

TROMA CERVANTES gave light and shape to the project, helped by ROTPIET (guitar / arrangements) and ZK INTERNATIONAL (vocals / writings).

Led by thrash / black and somewhat death metal influences, HATRED SUPERSTAR raises from massive violence, pornography, fanaticism, perversity and from any other hidden concepts rejecting mediocrity and frustration.

Soon a promotional video, directed and produced by YO of C.V.M. is recorded, with reporter of the devil being the sexy bitch MISS M., who represents the band and its world. Then a 4 tracks demo comes out, also featuring THE DISTILLER and EATER F. on drums and bass.

Currently searching for a serious label, the new complete line-up has now recorded its first full length in December 2011 at SOUND SUITE STUDIO (DESTROYER 666, CARPATHIAN FOREST…).

Ultra-violence just got a new moniker, and this is HATRED SUPERSTAR.

Fuck you and stay tuned motherfuckers. This is just the beginning…
