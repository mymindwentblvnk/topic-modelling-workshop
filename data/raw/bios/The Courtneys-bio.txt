The Courtneys are: Courtney Loove, Sydney Koke, and Jen Twynn Payne (Makeout Videotape). Three girls from Vancouver BC's downtown eastside. Their blend of fuzzy pop draws comparisons to Eddy Current Suppression Ring, Joy Division, The Clean, Dinosaur Jr, Pavement, and The Jesus and Mary Chain. Driving basslines, scrappy washed out guitar, and primitive beats are accompanied by layers of blazing solos and passionate energetic vocals: The Courtneys produce genuine and fun slacker rock. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Courtneys">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
