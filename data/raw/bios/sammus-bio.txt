Sammus is an upstate New York-based rap artist and producer. Her production is characterized by her use of uniquely chopped samples, and video game-like synths that are often contrasted with dirtier bass lines. She has been called a “20-credit” rapper because of her smart lyrics, diverse subject matter and versatile flow. As her Metroid-inspired name reflects, it is her hope that listeners and future fans will be pleasantly surprised by the contrast between the person society says she should be as an artist and who she actually is. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sammus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
