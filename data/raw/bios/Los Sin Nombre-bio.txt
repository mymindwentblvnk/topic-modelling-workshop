Los Sin Nombre was formed in February 2002 by Steve, Saul, Arvid & Jack to play Entombed covers.

As a natural succession the band started to write their own material.

After a few months of rehearsal and in search for a singer, they decided to record a four track demo which was entitled Tate Murders. Summer went by, and after trying out a handfull of singers they finally found their man for the job, PÃ¤r Palm.

Even though he had no experience, Palm went into the studio and recorded the vocals on Tate Murders.

In 2005 Lsn recorded a 5 song demo called LSN 2005. In August 2006 LSN got togheter with Tobias Leffler (ex NCO) to record there 4:e promo cd. The collaboration between the band and Tobias was great and out came a 6 track cd called Santini. In 2007 Steve decided to leave the band. No hard feeling what so ever, he just dident hade the motivation to play any more. After testing several drummers from the local area LSN finally found there man. So from now on , Olle Dicksson is the drummer of LSN.

Now LSN are reharsing for upcoming gigs . Check upcoming shows to see if LSN come to your city.
