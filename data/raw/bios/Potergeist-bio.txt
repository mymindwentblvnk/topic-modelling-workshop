Potergeist is a metal band from Athens, Greece. Formed in 2004, they usually refer to their musical style as "swamp metal", a combination of heavy, dark and groovy southern blues metal.

The band has released three full-length studio albums, 'Southwards' (Burning Star Records 2007), 'Muddy Mermaids' (Warner Music - Digital/ Distroball Productions 2012) and 'Swampires' (B-Otherside Records/ Distroball Productions 2013) as well as an EP, simply called 'Potergeist' (Self Financed 2008).

In 2010, along with recording the 'Muddy Mermaids' album, director Costas Zapas inspired by the music of Potergeist works with Alex S. and Asimakis Repas on his new movie 'The Rebellion of Red Maria' creating a brutal metal soundrack twisted enough to match Zapas' hardcore and often twisted world.

For their 'Swampires' album, the band has collaborated with David Castillo (Katatonia, Opeth, Draconian, Amon Amarth, InMe) on the mix, reamp and production. Angry Blue (Guns n' Roses, Danzig, Faith No More, Slayer, Melvins) designed the cover of the same album.

Through the years, Potergeist has played numerous gigs and have shared the stage with the likes of Lynyrd Skynyrd, Saint Vitus, Monster Magnet, Pro Pain, The Haunted and have become known for the energy they deliver when on stage.
