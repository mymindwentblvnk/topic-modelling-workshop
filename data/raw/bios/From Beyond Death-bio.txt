From Beyond Death is 4-piece band influenced by old school grind, new school tech grind, death metal, metalcore, and even some others in the mix. 

A 2004 studio EP, entitled "Virgin Holocaust," was originally supposed to be a full length, but it only contains 4 tracks recorded at Jayson Dezuzio's Stained Glass Studio (Number 12 LLU, Sawtooth Grin).

After a change of vocalists, the loss of a guitarist, quite a few shows and another demo, From Beyond Death finished a full length album entitled "Exhibit A." It was recorded, mixed, mastered and produced independently with Charlie Pistone @ 2nd. Ave Studios with artwork by Jase (Number 12 LLU). It was released on MEAT 5000 Records in 2005.

Shortly after Exhibit A, From Beyond Death recorded the single "Hexakosioihexekontahexaphobia" originally to be on a label compilation album that was never released. It was released independently in early 2006. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/From+Beyond+DEATH">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
