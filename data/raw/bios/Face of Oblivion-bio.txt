Technical Death Metal from Minnesota. James Lee, (ex Origin) is the vocals. Face of Oblivion's roots were laid by Hensley and Brandon writing songs on guitar, then Ogar and Matt Preston (Fetus Heist) came into the band and the brutality got ratcheted up a few notches. Unfortunately shit happened and Matt decided to part ways with Face of Oblivion. This was a huge loss, but luckily for the band we were able to rebound by quickly convincing James Lee (ex-ORIGIN) to take over duties on the mic. We've finally got Cole Gunther (What Lies Within, ex-Bodies in Wake) coming in on bass duties, so we're going full force, and we won't stop for anything!
