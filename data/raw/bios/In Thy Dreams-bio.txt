Formed in the end of 1995 in Sala, Sweden, by some guys drunk and happy to try out the new Gothenburg sound. Recorded three albums between 1996 and 1998 and they were all a few years late to be released. The band split up around 2000, Jari Petri and Stefan focussed on Carnal Forge (http://carnalforge.com). Håkan and Thomas did... nothing except a reunion gig for their old band Wombbath in 2005. In 2007 Håkan joined Vicious (http://www.viciousonline.com & http://www.myspace.com/viciousonline) to be the bassplayer.
