Emerging from the saturated metal scene come the raw, unfiltered blackened thrash metal act Blackrat. Spawned in Calgary, Canada, in 2012, the trio unapologetically pays homage to the old school style of thrash and speed metal. Their first full-length album titled Whiskey and Blasphemy is a full-on assault of primordial metal that shows no mercy from start to finish. The album contains 11 rapid-fire tracks, including a killer instrumental titled "Invocation of the Horned Rat." It has an early 80â€™s metal vibe with integrated black and death elements. Blackrat offers caustic vocals, fast blistering riffs, and relentless speed drumming. This is pure metal, and if you like it that way, then come and worship the vermin! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/BlackRat">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
