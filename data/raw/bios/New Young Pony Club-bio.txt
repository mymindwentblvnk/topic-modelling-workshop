New Young Pony Club (now NYPC) were a four-piece electro band from London consisting of Tahita Bulmer (vocals), Andy Spence (guitar), Lou Hayter (keyboards) & Sarah Jones (drums).  

Tahita & Andy formed the band in 2005. Mutual friends introduced vocalist Tahita Bulmer and producer Andy Spence, who shared a love of punk rock and dance music. The founding pair began writing together, originally only for Bulmer to perform. Spence later assumed a larger role when they decided to form a proper band, and the duo recruited Lou Hayter (keyboards), Igor Volk (bass) and Sarah Jones (drums). The band released two limited edition 7" singles ("The Get Go" and "Ice Cream") on indie label Tirk Recordings before being discovered by more established Australian label Modular Recordings, and signing a worldwide deal. 

The band's name came from lead singer Bulmer's desire to be a part of a club or team at school. Her original idea for the band name was the more concise "Pony Club", which she describes as "quirky and kinky and fun". A pre-existing Irish band had already claimed the name, and the prefix "New Young" was added to reflect that the band are "a newer, younger and kinkier Pony Club"

In 2013 Tahita & Andy continued on without Lou & Sarah as NYPC. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/New+Young+Pony+Club">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
