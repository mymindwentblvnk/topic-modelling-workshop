Zhigge is a dance/rap group from New York whose members Kazo, Face, Prancer,
Sound and Tonga had already made a name for themselves dancing in 
hip-hop clubs and appearing in videos by Special Ed, Public Enemy, YZ
and others. Pronounced "schiggy," the group's name stands for anything
fly or fresh, Prancer says. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Zhigge">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
