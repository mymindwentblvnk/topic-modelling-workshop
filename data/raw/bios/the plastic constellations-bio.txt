The Plastic Constellations were a Twin Cities-based indie rock band, formed around 1995 in Hopkins, MN. They were known for their rhythmic intensity, anthemic melodies, and playful sense of humor. After a prominent presence on the Minneapolis rock scene for over a decade, the band announced an "indefinite hiatus" just before their album release show for their fourth and presumably final album, "We Appreciate You." This last performance was on April 19, 2008 at First Avenue in Minneapolis.

Most of the band members are currently exclusively pursuing "regular jobs" with the exception of singer/guitarist Aaron Mader who is now focusing his DJ-ing pursuits as a member of the Minneapolis hip hop collective Doomtree under the name Lazerbeak .

They released albums via Frenchkiss Records, but earlier releases had been on 2024 Records, Modern Radio Records, Blood of the Young Records, and Pretenious Records.

In 2014 Jeff Allen of TPC released the TYTE JEFF EP, as Tyte Jeff. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Plastic+Constellations">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
