Once upon a time, there were two young scoundrels called Phil Wallbank and James Sullivan. Bored of school and all of the things that came with it, they had one dream - to make the most fabulous and enticing pop songs imaginable. Listening to everything from Blur to Muse, and The Lightning Seeds to Frank Sinatra, they set about doing it - strumming acoustic guitars and sketching out humorous little lyrics whenever they could...

Then, as if by magic, they stumbled across Thomas Beal and Rosalind Duignan-Pearson. Beal was a stylish and utterly ridiculous character, with the bass skills to match McCartney's finest hour. Roz was a friendly young beauty, whose drumming brought a tear of joy to the eye. From that moment, Ripchord were born.

Notching up a number of impressive support slots with the likes of The Kooks, Babyshambles, Bromheads Jacket, The Others, and touring with The Paddingtons, Ripchord were voted the best young band in the Midlands in 2005. Surely nothing could stop them now?!

And this brings us to the present day! Ripchord have just signed to 1965 Records. The label is owned by James Endeacott - the man responsible for signing The Libertines. He works alongside an excellent fellow called Raf, with whom he shares the same haircut! Under the guidance of Mr Endeacott, they have the world at their feet!

So what's next for Ripchord? Strings of hit singles? Saturday morning TV appearances? Drunken nights spent with supermodels? Who Knows!

But one thing is for sure - it's going to be a bloody good ride!
