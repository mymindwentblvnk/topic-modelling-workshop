Brazil, Pernambuco's state, Recife city, January 12th 2006, a heavy and furious sound... influenced by the 80’s bands (Old School) until the most contemporary band of Thrash Metal, almost an exhalation, an expurgation, now it appears the HYDROWN. So premature band, but with solid bases: learning and devotion from the members to the Metal, only could make them acquire a strong harness, vigorous enough to receive a just prize for they identity. METAL, PATHS AND MIND bombed for so many information of a sort so aggressive, the common is that any idea could ever be molded, transforming the dismissible; but keeping the eyes and ears open, so they could avoid the labels and “cliches”, creating a name: HYDROWN, elements and diverse environments. Since the 1st performance, in last five months, the members were surprised with nice critics, taking it as an authority to keep their quality, some of what they got in this short road, and until now they are in battle for their space among the greatest of Pernambuco Metal’s scene.” Workmanships: POISONOUS BLOOD, a demo with five belts, recorded in June 6th 2006. Nothing is defined, only Metal. Hydrown - 2006.
