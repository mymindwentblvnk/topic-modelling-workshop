"Their sound is serene melody, bone shaking bass, and ear piercing Electro noise all rolled into one fluid, handcrafted sound. One part Afrojack, two parts Skrillex, straight-up with a twist."

"It's weird to think that two beautiful sisters have the potential to create some of the best dubstep in today's saturated market. It certainly helps to have two hot DJ's but it's going to take a lot more to last in this industry. 'Killin' It' is a perfect example showing us why Krewella is here to stay"
