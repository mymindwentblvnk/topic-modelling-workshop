MASCHINENMENSCH (German for 'Machine-Man') was one of the countless projects from the German DJ and producer marc green. Under this moniker he released the track Domo Origato which contained a sample from the styx-song mr. roboto. Next to the B-Side Sie Spricht and some remixes of Domo Origato, there were no further releases from Maschinenmensch.
