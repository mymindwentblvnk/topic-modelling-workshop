Torment of Prometheus was an East-German band from Bautzen. Its first appearance in this actual lineup was in the end of 2003. Before starting this mighty project the members played in or are still part of other, mostly local bands all devoted to different kinds of heavy music (for instance stoned hajtzer, Eastern Empire, War from a Harlots Mouth). They found their way out of the rehearsing-cave to unleash a bastard of Swedish- and Black Metal, spiced up with some brutal hardcore breakdowns. They released a split CD called "Our minds - our thoughts" with their polish brothers of Angelreich  on Fuck-this-recordings early last year (2005). After playing a couple of shows in Germany and Poland meeting with an overwhelming response from the audience they are heading for more. More songs and more shows! If you are intressted into bands like Heaven Shall Burn, Amon Amarth or Belphegor you must check out Torment of Prometheus! In 2006, the band de facto broke up even if a corresponding official announcement was not proclaimed yet.
