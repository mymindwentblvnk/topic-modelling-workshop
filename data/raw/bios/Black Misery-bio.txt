Black Misery is a band out of North Carolina, USA that combines gothic, symphonic, metal, and rock elements to create their sound. 

Official Bio:
Black Misery was founded in 2004 when Michael, the guitarist, decided to take his song writing in a new direction that didn't quite fit with his other band Blissful Misery. Black Misery adds a synthesized symphonic, heavier, and more gothic feel to what Michael was already doing in Blissful Misery. The band's name even came from a song called Black Misery that Michael wrote for Blissful Misery. This song was even rewritten somewhat to be played Black Misery style.

To classify Black Misery as a single or even a few genres would be hard, because they take elements from all types of music. The band is biggest on metal and hard rock of all types, as well as gothic, symphonic, classical, acoustic style elements. Adding to all of that is Jessica's haunting and beautiful vocal stylings. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Black+Misery">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
