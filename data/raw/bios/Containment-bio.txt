Containment is a thrash metal band from Finland, founded by the drummer Mikko Saarela and his high school friend Elmo Kääriäinen in the spring of 2009.

The band got its first name; "Grave Presto" and began rehearsing their songs written by Mikko Saarela. The songs were from as far as the Coldcast-era, when the bandmates didn't want to play Mikkos compositions. Soon Grave Presto changed their name to Containment and their musical style grew into what it is now: technical thrash metal with progressive influences.

Containment got their first gig from the local youth center, Pleissi, in Heinola. The names of the bandmates were recognized by the friends and Containment earned its place within the bands of Heinola. After the first gig boys signed themselves to the upcoming annual band contest, Itä-Häme Band Challenge (which is a part of the SoundX-band contest), and after the contest, celebrated their status as Heinolas finalist in the SoundX.

Slowly Containments reputation spread and the band got their asses into a studio in Riihimäki to record their first demo in the spring of 2010.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Containment">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
