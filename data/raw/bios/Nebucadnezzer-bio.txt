Canadian metal tyrant Nebucadnezzer is a crushing yet melodic hybrid of death metal and progressive metal. The bands' influences span from technical death metal, to video game sound tracks. Fans of Arch Enemy, Wintersun and Nevermore will surely find Nebucadnezzer to be a punishing pleasure to the ears.

Since its formation in 2004, the band has shared the stage with metal icons Arch Enemy and Canadian legends Quo Vadis, Martyr, Augury and Neuraxis. Each member of Nebucadnezzer has studied the art of audio production in order to seize a full dictatorship of their sound. Together the band owns and operates a recording studio, at which their debut EP 'Our Last Masquerade' was recorded and produced.

It was in the childhood of Andries Hollander and Giovanni Ledda, during their joined study of music and guitar that the seed of Nebucadnezzer was sown. In their early teen years, they began to seek other members with whom they could expand their musical visions. It was at this point that Griffin Kissack (Dark Forest) began to play drums and joined the band. After working with several different bassists, Michael Braun joined the band and completed the ranks of Nebucadnezzer.

The band is currently in the process of completing material for a full length album and upon its release, they plan to tour across Canada and the United States. It is the intention of Nebucadnezzer to infuse themselves within the metal scene and spread their absolute musical visions throughout the entire earth. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nebucadnezzer">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
