Drawing inspiration from both classical and contemporary heavy metal, Trihexyn is an experience that nearly every person, from the most fanatical metal-head to the average listener, can enjoy. Beauty and brutality drive dynamic melodies with lyrics that address internal conflict, life and death, and a struggle against the status-quo. The project began with Shawn and Greg Staub when they came together to fulfill a mutual vision of heavy metal. Joe Baker joined shortly thereafter to put rhythm to the existing songs.   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Trihexyn">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
