Hail Spirit Noir was founded in the dawn of 2010 by Haris and Theoharis, also members of the avant-garde/symphonic combo Transcending Bizarre? and the prog band Rex Mundi. Having already spent a year and a half on composing new material, the two masterminds of the band gathered a troupe of competent musicians in the foothills of legendary mount Olympus, at Lunatech Studios, to record their debut album. After severe experimentation and non-stop recording sessions, the result was an amalgam of psychedelic elements, horror atmosphere and modern day black metal. Towards the end of 2011, the band joined forces with Code666/Aural music for a worldwide release of the debut album "Pneuma" in the spring of 2012. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hail+Spirit+Noir">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
