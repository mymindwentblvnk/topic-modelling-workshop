There is more than one band by the name Deceptor:

1). Deceptor is a British Thrash Metal group, consisting of Paul Fulda (Bass/Vocals), Sam Mackertich (Guitar/Vocals), and James Ashbey (Drums). They have released two demos to date: 'Start the Assault' in 2006, and 'Bound to the Oath' in 2007, before releasing an EP ('Soothsayer') in 2011.

2). Deceptor was a Heavy/Power Metal band from Greece. Forming in 1989, they annually released demos until 1991, and split up some time after. While their work remains relatively unheard of to this day, a compilation entitled 'The Legend' was released on Unisound in 2002, citing everything recorded in their late-eighties/early-nineties period. Their vocalist, Yiannis Koutselinis (commonly known as John K) went on to record an album with British Progressive Metal group Balance of Power, and then went on to form Biomechanical.
