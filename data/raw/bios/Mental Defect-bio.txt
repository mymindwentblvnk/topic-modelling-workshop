Mental Defect are a 3-piece rock band hailing from Manchester, England. Taking influences from bands such as Red Hot Chili Peppers, Rage Against the Machine and Metallica, amongst many others, MD have fused together different aspects of music to create music which they enjoy playing and which they hope you will all enjoy.

Currently attending Stockport and Xaverian colleges, the band has been a strong focus for each member over the last year, taking every opportunity given to them and in the process proving they can match up to any challenge given to them.
