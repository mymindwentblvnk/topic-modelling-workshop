1) dROME is mysterious UK-based experimental industrial / drone ambient project.

Appears on split release with Another Headache by label Work In Progress in 1990, and also on numerous compilations during first half of the 90's, such Melt (1992); Melt City (1992); Luxuria (1994).


2) Drome are keyboardist and vibraphonist Burnt Friedman & electronic musician Frank Hernandez. Both from Koeln (Germany).

Drome was an ambient "chill-out" project. Anachronism (Silent, 1992), Final Corporate Colonization Of The Unconscious (Wigwam, 1993 - Ninja Tune, 1994), one of the first recordings to incorporate hip-hip breaks into chill-out grooves, and Dromed (Kiff, 1995) are works of manic assemblage that often match the complexity of Edgar Varese's avantgarde piece.

Aliases: Some More Crime.
