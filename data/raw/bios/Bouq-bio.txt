Bouq, is the brainchild of the multi-instrumentalist Muhannad Bursheh (also in: Tyrant Throne, Augury (Jor)). Based in the Jordanian capital Amman, the one-man band was previously known as 'Phex' between 2001-2007, and during that period, just like M. Bursheh's other bands, managed to become recognized among the most renowned metal acts in the region, with a solid full-length album in 2005, entitled 'Transfixion', and 3 demos in 2001, 2002, and 2003. The project even managed to perform a few live shows with the recruitment of session members.

In 2007, a positively unstable period in the band's journey began, with lots of changes occurring - in specific; the band name, the musical style and lyrical concepts. 'Bouq' is ancient/classical Arabic for â€˜war horn' or 'blowing horn'.

Through Horned Helmet Productions, a re-issue of the full-length 'Transfixion' was released in October 2010. The re-issue has the title 'Ascending from Transfixion', and is released under the project's current name; Bouq. In December 2010, also through Horned Helmet Productions, the long anticipated 2nd full-length album 'Berserk' was finally released. 'Berserk' lifts Bouq to another level in masterly musicianship and execution - the album marks a new era in Bouq's history, where the new sound of the band is introduced, leaving behind the groovy death/dark metal style heard on the 1st album and earlier releases. 'Berserk' is a unique experience of ancient spirited dark/black metal enriched with tribal, barbaric, & warrior-like atmospheres. It is but the first part of an epic and diverse peregrination Bouq is taking - after 'Berserk', the focus will be set on the colossal ancient civilizations of the Near East.
