There are three groups by the name Coelacanth:

1. Coelacanth is a ambient/noise group from San Francisco. Coelacanth is the sound art collaboration between Loren Chasse and Jim Haynes. 

2. Coelacanth is a two-piece bass/drums post-rock/instrumental group from Milwaukee, WI consisting of Peter J Woods (bass guitar) and Danny Friedman (drumset). Coelacanth was created as an offshoot from from the wildly unpopular and un-funny E=MC Hammer (comedy/avant-garde/preformance art). This split occurred in 2008. E=MC Hammer makes appearances from time to time to annoy music listeners, but is generally inactive.

Coelacanth's main influences stem from Dianogah, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Slint, The Mercury Program, Toe, June of 44, Tortoise, Pele, Piglet, Maserati, and Shipping News. The bulk of their songs are titled with paving puns found on the Poblocki Paving Co. billboard along the westbound side of US Interstate 94 exiting Milwaukee towards Madison. Their current material is available at http://coelacanth.bandcamp.com.

A full length is in the plans for the future, but is currently on hold until a suitable label is found for release.

3. Coelacanth is a U.S. death metal/hardcore punk band from Cincinnati, Ohio. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Coelacanth">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
