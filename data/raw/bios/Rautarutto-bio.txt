The whole idea of the band started in autumn of 2003 when Joni discussed with Antti and Heikki about black metal scene. Discussion turned into some suicidal ideas and Joni mentioned that it would be great to turn these ideas into music. Soon they started to plan the core of the band. Progress was slow, because they needed second guitarist. Later they discovered alkowarrior Tero, and the band was formed.

Musical style was clear: Grim, depressive and aggressive black metal. Because Joni was a mainman of the band and a true fan of Darkthrone and Ildjarn, they have influenced in Rautarutto's music with their ideology, and of course, their raw and primitive sound. Band's name, Rautarutto, Iron plague in english, is a metaphora for war. Joni has claimed, that Rautarutto is a black metal band with an essence of war. Black metal is antihumane declaration of war, not some judeochristian commercial "music" spiced up with fucking sweep-solos.
