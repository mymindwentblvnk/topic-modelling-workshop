Nebelhorn is a one-man viking-metal project  with German lyrics about nordic mythology or vikings. Wieland is the sole member of Nebelhorn, but he had some sessional musicians - a drummer and a singer - who helped him to record the debut mini-album Utgard. 

Nebelhorn has released the albums Utgard, Gen Helwegs Grund and Fjordland Sagas, their latest album.

The band was formed in 2002 in Murrhardt, Germany.
