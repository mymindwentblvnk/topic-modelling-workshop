Amy Taylor (vocals), Bryce Wilson (drums) and Declan Martens (guitar) founded Amyl in their sharehouse in early 2016. They formed the band, wrote a handful of tunes and released their debut EP, Giddy Up, all in a span of twelve hours. Gus Romer came on board to play bass shortly afterward and Amyl and the Sniffers took its current shape: a grimy four-piece taking its cues from a diverse mix of genres including pub rock, Aussie punk, country and western and rap rave. The band set out to have as much fun as possible and scared up a whole lot of fans along the way.
