Not to be confused with Icelandic Króm

There are several bands with the name Krom:

1)
Krom is a Swedish trip-hop group with members Sofia Allard and Johan Lejdemyr. They released their first album this in 1999.

2)
Krom were comprised of Marco Basili (guitar/vocals), Andrea Basili (drums), Andrea Vacca (bass guitar), and Albione di Pietrantonio (guitar). In early 2003 the fledgeling group released a debut, “Krom”, following soon with “Through the Looking Glass” and “Spectrum Token Shift”. It was self-produced with a limited budget, the first two CDs recorded live (“Krom” in 6 hours, “Through the Looking Glass” in just 3 hours). With “Spectrum Token Shift” however, the group had a higher budget, giving the opportunity to perform professionally, colloborating with Francesco Allulli (sax) and Fabio Recchia (piano); the group had by this time completely changed from the musical tendencies of Hastur. 
Following “Spectrum Token Shift”, Albione and Andrea Vacca left the band for different endeavors. By the time of “Wind under the Door”(2005), the band was Marco Basili (guitars & bass guitar), Andrea Basili (drums) and Gabriel Vittori (vocals). On 2006 Krom changed their name in Kailash. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Krom">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
