The band was born in 2011 from an idea of Mattia Gosetti, Italian bass player and composer, heavily influenced by '90's rock/metal music and with a great passion for symphonic music. After several musicals, he starts a heavy metal adventure with his wife Sonja: a singer with a biting voice, inspired to the mythical american grunge movement. The couple carries out a little self-producted full-length which contains rivisitations of old Mattia's songs. They decide to play live, and for this reason Massimo Pin joins the project; the guitarist's sound is gritty, elegant and eclectic, a beautiful and passionate rock/blues and metal vein.

After some live shows, the new line-up decide to express itself with another album; Mattia begins to compose stuff for a new concept, “Sofia's forgotten violin”, a gothic/fantasy drama. Arranged by the voice of Sonja, the guitars of Massimo and thanks to the collaboration with Videoradio label by Giuseppe Aleo, this story comes to life. This work can boast the presence of a great guest: the fantastic touch of Elvenking's violinist Lethien
