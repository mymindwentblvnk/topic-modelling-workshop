Robbie Williams? Robin Williams? Robbing Millions? Well, what’s in a name?

Fact is that the dreamy, psychedelic sounds, syncopated rythms, angular guitars and breezy lofi synths could not take you further away from the former Take That bad boy’s cheesy brand of pop. They do, however, share a sense of weird humour and nervous ticks that might click with the former Hollywood A-lister, although the one that starred in Terry Gilliam’s The Fisher King as opposed to the caramel-tears crying Patch Adams clown.

On the selfreleased 6 track debut EP ‘Ages & Sun’ the Brussels based 5-piece digs deep into pop history and comes out with a fresh and clever sound. Robbing Millions winks to innovators as Can and Robert Wyatt, but also share a love for the fuzzy slacker pop of Pavement, the shinny synth-skate gems of Grandaddy and the psychedelic popbrilliance of The Flaming Lips. There’s something very visual about RM’s songs. Imagine Beck soundtracking a Monthy Python inspired Looney Tunes episode without being laugh-out-loud funny.

There’s catchy Dragon Ball Z-inspired hide & seek pop (‘Tenshinah’), stargazing jazz guitars (‘Ages & Sun’), a “how to fit progrock in a 2min popsong” workshop (‘Cellophane’) and screeching guitarsolo’s slicing through playfull synths (‘I Didn’t Realize’).

Since starting out in January 2013, RM can already count bands as Balthazar, The Van Jets, BRNS & MLCD among their fans and the band already played the AB in Brussels (support Palma Violets), MOD in Hasselt, l’Escalier in Liège and got invited to prestigious festivals as Les Nuits Botaniques, Les Ardentes, Dour, Boomtown and Deep In The Woods. They also won the Verdur Rock competition as best new band in 2013. The track ‘Tenshinhan’ got selected by Radio 1 in Flanders through Vi.be and is currently in rotation on Studio Brussel. 
Robbing Millions is artist in residence for the season 2013-2014 at the legendary venue Ancienne Belgique.
