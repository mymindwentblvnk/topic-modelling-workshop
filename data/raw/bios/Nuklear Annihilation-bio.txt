Nuklear Annihilation was formed in october 2005 a.b. by Desolator and Aldagil in Blagoevgrad, BULGARIA. The first demo "Destruktive Warmachine" is the result of a lot of substances and was recorded mainly at night between october 2005 a.b. and april 2006. In the summer of 2006 Nuklear Annihilation signed a contract with the true underground german black metal label Black Hate Productions for a 7"EP release. In october 2006 started the recording sessions for the new demo "Horns Up!". In february 2007 the 7"EP was released -limited to 500 copies,the release comes with a fuckin' oldschool bloodred layout and includes a big foldout poster and inlay. Now they are negotiating with the german label Fog Of the Apocalypse for the release of the new demo titled "Horns Up!".
