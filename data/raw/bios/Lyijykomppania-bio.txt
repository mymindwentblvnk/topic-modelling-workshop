Lyijykomppania means "Lead Company".

Lyijykomppania was first founded in 1981 for the first time. The band disbanded two years later without releasing anything. The band re-formed with the same line-up in 1990 and disbanded again in 1998.

Later on, Timo Rautiainen formed a band called Timo Rautiainen & Trio Niskalaukaus, which achieved heavy commercial success in Finland.

They re-formed yet again in 2003.
