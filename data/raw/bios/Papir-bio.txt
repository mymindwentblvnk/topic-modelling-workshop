There are two artists with this name.

1. Papir is a krautrock band from Copenhagen, Denmark. Band correctly eschews the traditional pigeonholes of krautrock, prog rock, space rock and stoner rock, while admitting to retaining elements of all these nebulous and intersecting genres. Influences cited by the band include Can and electric Miles Davis (Stundum is semi-improvised, with a few extra layers of guitar and percussion overdubbed onto the frenzied three-piece jams), as well as German guitar legends Manuel Gottsching (specifically the two extended freakouts on the first Ash Ra Tempel album) and Michael Rother (as heard on the crushing and thoroughly atypical early Kraftwerk bootleg K2).

2. Papir is a soul / jazz / blues / chanson ensemble from Maribor, Slovenia.
