DESCRIPTION
Ottawa-based heavy rock band. You may experience PTSD like symptoms from listening to our album. I'm talking Vietnam type shit. Running through the forest covered in shitstains. It'll put you in a bad place. Your aunt's pastor's pedophiliac wet dream in a serviette. The artist formerly known as Jesus Mullet. Ex-members of Bless This Mess, I Hate Sally, The Chariot, Architect. Who gives a fuck?

BIOGRAPHY
From remnants of left over steaming turd Jesus Mullet. We got our shit back together only to flake out again. Sorry, we're not post-metal or hip indie rock. We shower somewhat regularly. We aren't political. We don't wear fedoras, vests and v-necks or ride fixed gears. Rock out with yer tic tac out.
