Imagine combining Jean Michel Basquiat, Richard Pryor, Amiri Baraka, HR of Bad Brains, Rakim, Seth Rogen and Marcus Garvey; then you would have a gateway to Labtekwon. Labtekwon has performed at the Lyricist Lounge in New York and Project Blowed in Los Angeles; both recognized as the ground zero of true school Hip Hop artists on both coasts. Labtekwon is also a champion of Zulu Nation Freestyle Competition and a Zulu Nation Chapter Leader for Baltimore and Washington, DC: Labtekwon is a true Hip Hop yogi. He is considered the greatest Emcee to ever hail from Baltimore, Maryland. Labtekwon has shared the stage with Afrika Bambaata, Rakim, Kool Keith, MF DOOM, Psycho Les, A Tribe Called Quest, Brand Nubian, KRS-One, Black Thought, Aceyalone, Digital Underground and countless other Hip Hop artists that represent the pinnacle of lyricism and excellence.
