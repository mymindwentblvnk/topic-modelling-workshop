Asperatus was created in 2012 on the initiative of Rados≈Çaw Godzina and Zbigniew Grabowski. In 2015, the band presented their first EP entitled Warped Reality, which received a series of positive reviews. Shortly after releasing the album, the band suspended their activities to resume it in 2019 with almost completely new people. In March 2020, the band began work on the second EP entitled Sanctified State Of Decay. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Asperatus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
