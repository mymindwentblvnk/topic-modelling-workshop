When Elle Watson writes, she's drawn to subjects that are a little off-kilter. Maybe even a little dark. "I find a sense of imbalance so inspiring," says the 19-year-old singer-songwriter. "That can be in anything: contradictions that you have in yourself, or something that you feel isn't right in a situation. When I write, I just put my hands on the piano, and find a bit of dissonance that I find really pretty. Then I go from there."

It's this tendency in her songwriting toward the jarring and the eerily beautiful that got her signed to Paul Epworth's Wolf Tone label at the tender age of 16. Watson had been laying down some early demos with Epworth's engineer Joe Hartwell-Jones at the time. Hartwell-Jones -- aka JHJ -- invited her back to the studio to continue their collaboration, and over the course of six months they recorded a clutch of stormy electronic R&B songs. Little did Watson know, she'd been invited back at the specific request of Epworth, who had heard her early recordings and encouraged JHJ to keep working on them. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Elle+Watson">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
