Manchester post-punk act formed in 1979 by original members of the Durutti Column.  They released two albums and their single "Wadada" received a Single Of The Week accolade in Sounds magazine and had some play on nighttime radio. The band split up in 1982, after which Chris Joyce and Tony Bowers drifted into Simply Red and David Rowbotham was murdered with an axe. It is hard to decide which was the worse fate. Sadly, reissues have not been forthcoming.
