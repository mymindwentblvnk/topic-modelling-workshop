Dawn Of Chaos are a UK based Death Metal band, formed in 2004.

The band is comprised of frontman Paul Hartburn, guitarists Dan Rochester & Ross Oliver, bassist/backing vocalist Dan Jones, and drummer Ian Finley.

Having played shows and tours up and down the country with bands such as Insision, Trigger The Bloodshed, Desecration, Severe Torture, Immolation and Entombed, to name a few, and appearing at festivals such as Damnation Festival, Leeds Deathfest, Causing Chaos For Cancer Fest, and our first overseas gig at Gothenburg Deathfest, the band has gained favourable reviews from magazines and webzines, as well as building up a devoted fan base.

2011 sees Dawn Of Chaos recording and releasing their debut full length album, entitled 'The Need To Feed', as well as more gigs, tours and festival appearances, across the UK and Europe. 
In 2009 came the first label release, as Dawn of Chaos joined up with Liverpool's 'Neuroma' to release a split through 'Grindethic Records' entitled 'Northern Discomfort'. In the time since it's release, Ben Aldred departed to be replaced by Ian Finley (Wodensthron/ That Hideous Strength) and Ross Oliver (Risen Prophecy) replacing Ken Turner.

2010 sees a promo release for free download with two tracks recorded at Creation Studios in Glasgow, and two live recordings from the Purple Turtle in London.
