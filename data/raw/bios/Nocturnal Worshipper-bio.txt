Nocturnal Worshipper was formed in the winter of 1993 in Rio de Janeiro - Brazil, by Hofgodhar, Adrameleck and Wizard, having as one of the main objectives, to rescue the roots of 80's black metal. They had influence of bands like Bathory, Mayhem, Hellhammer, Venom and Sodom.

They were pretty polemical while active, with the known fights with Mysteriis and Unearthly(another black metal bands from Rio de Janeiro).

It was also one of the few female fronted black metal bands in Brazil.

Last known line-up:

Thuringwithal (Vocals) 
Hofgodhar* (Bass) 
Kataris (Guitar) 
Radagast (Drums)

*Eduardo Mortaza (Hofgodhar) is now involved with unblack metal and christian rock.
