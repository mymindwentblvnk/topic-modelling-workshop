Mirrorring is a collaboration between Liz Harris (Grouper) and Jesy Fortino (Tiny Vipers). They made one album: Foreign Body. The recordings on this album came about through a songwriting session in Portland, Oregon. The resulting sounds are contemplative, reflective, and introspective, creating a feeling as much as a song, a mood as much as a tune. "Mirrorring has an extra r in it to create a literal mirroring inside of the word." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mirrorring">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
