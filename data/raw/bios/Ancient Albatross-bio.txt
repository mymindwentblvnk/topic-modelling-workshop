Ancient Albatross takes flight from the murky swamps of West Palm Beach, Florida bringing sonic doom to unsuspecting eardrums. The band was formed in May 2012 by Phil Pinto and Daniel Mergens on drums and guitar respectively, and Tony LaFerrera came into the fold in June. Song ideas began forming from extensive jam sessions, and the bandâ€™s sound quickly grew more massive. Ancient Albatross exists by a solid mission: to bring a fresh approach to a genre full of cliches; creating songs that aren't unnecessarily long with a steady, seamless flow, and enough hooks to captivate listeners. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ancient+Albatross">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
