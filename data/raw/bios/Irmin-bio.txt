From the Eastern Netherlands comes IRMIN, a furious black/thrash metal battalion that clashed it's steel sword from the year 2002 until it's final battle in 2009.

During those years, IRMIN gained territory with aggressive thrash / black metal attacks with a touch of heavy metal; shredding lead guitars, blast beats and a signature dual vocal attack with high pitch screams and monstrous grunts. Raw and fast with an old school sound like Kreator, Destruction and Mayhem, IRMIN blew to pieces all those who set foot on the battle grounds of metal.
