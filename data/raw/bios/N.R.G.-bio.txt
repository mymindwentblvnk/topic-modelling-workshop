N.R.G. was the name of two different music groups:

1. The first alias of Neil Rumney, working within the sounds of early breakbeat hardcore, techno and acid. His first releases were on Chill Records in 1991, during the ever growing rave scene at the time, before releasing such classics as "I Need Your Lovin" and "He Never Lost His Hardcore". Another alias he went under at the time was Liquid Crystal, in which in 1993, he released "The Chromatic EP" and "The Chromatic EP II". These 12"'s are some of the most highly sought after hardcore EPs today. Later on in the mid 1990s, Neil began to produce under such names as "Trotters Independent Traders" and "Summer Junkies" resulting from his love of wanting to experiment with the different styles of house music. The Trottersâ€™ later sound was to influence many to produce similar styles, and help to fuel the Bassline scene, that after a few years has now enjoyed great chart success in the UK.

2. Hard Rock band from the 80's, most well known for their contribution to the 1986 movie: Transformers: The Movie's original Motion Picture Soundtrack, Transformers The Movie.  Released one full length album in 2001 NRG2 Transformed that consists of a remastered version of the song "Instruments of Destruction"  (from the '86 Transformers film)  and previously unreleased material recorded in the mid-80's; limited to 1000 copies.
