KidEyes, alternative pop-rock duo from Los Angeles, shines light directly into a dark modern world with humble hooks, rich warm guitar melodies, shiny synths, and rock steady grooves. The duo, Greg Cahn and Ben Epand, communicate their music as honest pop through a lens of everlasting youth and optimism.

KidEyes burst on the airwaves in 2020 hitting #1 on KROQ Locals Only with their single 'Ready To Go'. Their live performances are infectious, holding their audiences close through every note, illuminating them with a renewed sense of belief. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kideyes">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
