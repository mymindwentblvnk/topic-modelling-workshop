Blastronaut are a heavy rock band from Manchester, formed at the tail end of 2010.  Having gone through a few line-up changes since the inception, the now stable line-up consists of:

Chris Whitehouse - Vocals
Andy Daffern - Bass
Nathan Mallon - Guitars
Ben Roberts - Guitars
Todd Staszko - Drums

The musical style consists of a driving heavy stoner rock vibe, complete with huge riffs and toppped off with melodic vocal harmonies and classic rock solos.  Blastronaut would not look out of place on a bill with Fu Manchu, Clutch, Monster Magnet or The Sword.

A debut album, Burning Mother, was recorded with TimG (MTV/Ginger Wildheart) at his studio in Manchester and was released in 2013.  The album has been described by Metal Hammer as; "Injecting stomping rolls and riffs into bourbon soaked southern rock...", whilst Powerplay have remarked that the album is; "Twelve songs of burning riffs and angsty vocals.  Closert to stoner music with its gloopy, fuzzy riffs, it separates itself from that general pack by shunning the genre's slower paced approach for any altogether more frenetic pace that blows up in your face from the very first track...".  Stoner Rock blogger, The Sludgelord has hailed, "Blastronaut deserve credit for the intricate tones and melodies they have created to entertain the listener. Itâ€™s an action packed album you will be listening to in the months to come."

The band operate around the simple premise that the songs and having a good time come joint first and everything else will sort itself out.  Each song is put through the mill and back again to make sure that anyone who comes to a live gig will leave with sore ears and a wide grin. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Blastronaut">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
