1) Hailing from Helsinki Finland!

Groovy attitude metal with a taste of thrash and catchy melodies is what's Drown In Hate is all about. Groups like Slayer, Pantera, Machine Head and In Flames have influenced their music in many ways.

Drown In Hate was previously known as “Condition Red” and later “CR”. The band has over ten years of experience playing live and in the studio. In the summer of 2006 the band won the Finnish national final of the Emergenza band contest.

Keep your heads up! Downtuned guitars and overdriven bass will give you straight and painfull riffs and heavyweight drumming and deep growling will take care that your head shakes. Drown In Hate makes you raise your fists in the air and scream for more!
