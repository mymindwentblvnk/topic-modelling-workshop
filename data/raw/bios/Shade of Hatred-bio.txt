Shade of Hatred is a Melodic Death Metal band from De Bilt. Originating from the mind of Florian, the band descended into existence in 2011. Based on a clear musical vision the group basically assembled itself with Rik as vocalist, Florian and Bas on guitar, Terry on bass and Yannick on drums. With a passion for melody as well as brutal force, the five young but experienced members deliver strong and enthralling songs interlaced with lyrical themes ranging from old forgotten mythological tales to the cold and dark reflections of today’s society. Driven, passionate, but most of all metal.

In November 2011 Shade of Hatred made their live debut at a Folk Metal event, after which they would play an awful lot more with other Folk Metal bands. It was at the gig with Heidevolk at De Baroeg, when Terry declared that they aren’t actually that folk, but all the more metal.

The 1st of May 2012 marks the beginning of the recorded history of the band, with the release of Thanatus. This first demo received positive criticism from various websites. Right now the band is preparing for an EP called Invidious Revelations, which will be released somewhere in the summer of 2013.

Expect more to come in the nearby future. The shadowing of the world has only just begun. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Shade+of+Hatred">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
