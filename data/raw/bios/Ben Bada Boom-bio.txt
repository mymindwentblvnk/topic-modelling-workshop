Beatmaker from Hamburg, Germany.

3BÂ´s sounds come from various influences such as Electronic, Funk and Soul. He takes those influences and then turns them into something new. With a result clearly linked to hip-hop and broken beat. Current, but difficult to classify genre wise. His compositions are characterized by an occasional glimpse of 8-Bit, some 80's synth work and Celtic tunes. With something of a stray jazz trumpet defends dirty points. Ben has focused on bringing a new, yet fresh, unheard sound using many unique techniques. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ben+Bada+Boom">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
