Daniel Avery is an electronic music producer and DJ from Bournemouth, a resort town on the south coast of England. Avery's music encompasses abstract techno, house, IDM, and shoegaze. Initially going by the name "Stopmakingme", he began releasing well-received indie dance tracks and remixes starting in 2009, but broke through after he switched to his own name in 2012. His expansive full-length debut, Drone Logic, was released to wide acclaim in 2013. Five years and a DJ-Kicks volume later, Avery released his second album, the more cerebral, immersive Song for Alpha.
Avery began DJing indie music as an 18-year-old in his native Bournemouth, England. It wasn't until a trip to Ibiza that he was inspired to spin house and techno, after seeing crowds open to dancing to new and unfamiliar tracks. He connected with Filthy Dukes through a local bar and spun at the synth pop group's Kill 'Em All club night in London, which led to opening slots at the prestigious Fabric. As a producer and remixer, he developed a raw, robust sound that incorporated his love for odd, alien elements. Output from 2009 through 2011, including collaborations with Justin Robertson and remixes for the likes of Little Boots, Metronomy, Hercules & Love Affair, and In Flagranti, was credited to Stopmakingme. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Daniel+Avery">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
