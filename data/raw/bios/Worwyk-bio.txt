Worwyk (pron. war-wick) plays true heavy metal combining melodic, semi-technical riffs with scorching solos and both clean and aggressive vocals. The band is strictly a studio project, fronted by Tom Vitacco, a musician based in the suburbs of Chicago. After playing in a couple of local Chicago metal bands, Tom found he enjoyed the recording aspect more than trying to keep a band together, so he built a small home studio to record his music. Tom writes all the music for Worwyk, and handles all the mixing, mastering and artwork for the band. Since the band is a studio project only, Worwyk does not play live.

The latest album, Malignant, is the highly anticipated follow up to In Solitude (2006) and features new vocalist Jason Russo (formally of Herod and Darkling). The album has 10 new songs of true metal highlighted by Jason's dynamic vocals and Tom's crunching yet melodic guitar work. Lyrically, the album continues to deal with topical themes, including medicine, religion, abuse and tragic human behavior. This is also the first Worwyk disc with no instrumental song! For fans of Iron Maiden, Megadeth, Judas Priest, Metallica, Death, Iced Earth, Kreator...or really anyone into metal!!!

Worwyk is currently working on the follow up to Malignant with Jason Russo handling vocals once again.
