Neige Noire was created in 2006 in Ajax, Ontario, Canada by Feuer. 

Feuer released a split cdr with both of his projects together Neige Noire and Un Moment De Silence (Drone/doom) called Sounds of The Abandoned Forest.

Main influence is Darkthrone but Feuer was influenced by many bands!

Feuer did this project solo but was trying to get a full band going. Feuer found a drummer but never had the chance to practice therefore that did not workout and also found a keyboardist and had 1 practice which did not workout either because of the lack of time to practice. Therefore Feuer decided to call the project off. He may write material in the near future but is undecided.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Neige+Noire">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
