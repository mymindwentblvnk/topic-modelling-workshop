Formerly known as the band Divine Desecration, Sanctification is a swedish death metal band formed around 2001 in Östersund, Sweden by Tomas Elofsson, Nils Fjellström and Matias Mohlin. The band plays highly US-inspired death metal with roots in the swedish old school, and with lyrics evolving mainly around anti-christianity, pain and death.

The band has so far released one demo (in 2001-2002), one promo album in 2004, and two full length studio albums: "Misanthropic Salvation" in 2003 and "Black Reign" in 2009.
