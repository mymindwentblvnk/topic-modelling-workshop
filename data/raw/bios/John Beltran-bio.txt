The NME once reckoned there was a clock inside John Beltran's head stuck fast at 5 am. It was because his music appeared to inhabit a pre-dawn state between the dancefloor and the soon to be sex or dream-soaked duvet, a special area where soft rhythm and ticking sensuality were neatly intertwined.

John was brought up on classical, jazz and latin at home - early sonic memories include John Coltrane, Tito Puente and Bach. Still based in his hometown of Lansing, Michigan, USA, Beltran leads a quiet, but athletic life. He makes music influenced by his attitudes towards life and listening habits, plus trace elements of dancefloor experiences both past and present. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/John+Beltran">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
