Nafregah is a folk / pagan / black metal band located in the San Francisco bay area.

Their first release was titled "Fall 2007 EP" and contained four tracks of melodic black metal that stayed more true to basic black metal than a progressive style.

Their second album is due out in the Spring of 2009 and will contain many folk and acoustic elements.  The band has been heavily influenced by music from the Slavic & Roma cultures and is going to show that more and more in their upcoming work.

The word Nafregah translates to "The Never Beast".  The omni-present and more often than not; neglected element of nothing or emptiness is a consistent influence in balancing the sounds produced by the members of Nafregah. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nafregah">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
