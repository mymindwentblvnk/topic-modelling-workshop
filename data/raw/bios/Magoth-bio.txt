Formed in 2011, MAGOTH existed for the moment as a side project of the guitar player and singer "Heergott". The Intention to create a band project which differs particularly in the complex of themes to common bands gave rise to six songs that were recorded in a studio but not published back then. With the joining of the guitar player „Shagnar“ in 2013 concrete plans of a release of the songs as a demo player under the title of „Der Toten Gesang“ were made. Rehearsals with the drummer „Widrir“ in 2015 unveiled the true potential of the songs which brute and raw riffing get frequently crossed by doom and atmospheric passages. In cooperation with Liquid Aether Audio the demo player were finished and released on 4th april 2016. Due to the confirmation of seven shows the bass player's position were firstly filled by a guest musician, but a short time later by „Havoc“. At time MAGOTH is working on the first full lenght player "Anti Terrestrial Black Metal" which will be released in the middle of 2017. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/magoth">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
