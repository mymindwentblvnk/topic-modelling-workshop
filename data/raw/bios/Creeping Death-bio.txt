Denton, TX death metal unit Creeping Death have been creating buzz since they dropped their first demo in 2015, the year the band formed. Their reputation was bolstered by a subsequent pair of loud and laudable EPs, making them one of the more talked-about bands in the underground. Now, they're ready to unleash their debut full-length, Wretched Illusions, a warcry of old school death metal.
