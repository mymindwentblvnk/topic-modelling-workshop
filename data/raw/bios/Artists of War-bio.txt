Artists of War is a solo project begun by Athens guitarist Brad Olsen in the Summer of 2010. What began as a single song foray that fused the battering rhythms of High On Fire with the progressive melodies of Mastodon in “The Judge” eventually spawned multiple offspring and re-workings of older songs. Remixing, acquisition of new software and ever improving studio skills lead to a full album being planned out for a 2011 release. During the fall of 2010 more songs were written and previous ones were brought up to speed with new mixes and altered arrangements. Artwork design began in January and lasted a little over a month. During that time more songs were written and the album was rearranged to accommodate. The self-titled debut album is slated for a release in March via CDbaby, iTunes, Amazon mp3 and other online retailers. It will be distributed under the Athens based progressive metal label Tricalibur Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Artists+of+War">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
