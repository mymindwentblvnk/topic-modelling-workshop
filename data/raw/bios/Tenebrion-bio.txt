There are 2 bands named Tenebrion; One from Philippines and one from Croatia.

Croatia:
2004 was the year it all began. Bauglir on guitar and Nefarious on drums (later on vocals) was the original and final line up. First sound of Tenebrion was raw, not nerely melodic as present. In the beginning they were a cover bend influenced by Norwegian black metal, hence the creation of their own grim and symphonic tunes were just in the phase of induction. Even though they had spent last few years as an underground project, gravely creating melodic and atmospheric black metal, they have finally managed to dredge sinister ideas onto reality with their first demo release Atrum Tempestas, which is available for download.


Philippines:
Tenebrion is an underground black/death metal band formed in 2005 by Erik Romeijn (Piratenzombie) and Bart Romeijn.
Tenebrion wasn't very succesfull at first but after recording the songs Alle Eendjes zwemmen in het water and Invocation they became a blast worldwide!
after Invocation they created Stormentor (Kreator cover, it used be called Tormentor) and transilvanian plumber. 
now the band isn't able to record anymore, their great guitarist started a project called Piratenzombie
he isn't able to record anymore either since his microphone died... <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tenebrion">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
