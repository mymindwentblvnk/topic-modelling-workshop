Nancy McCallion teamed up with high school music partner Catherine Zavala to form The Mollys in 1989, racking up seven indie releases and countless rave-review shows in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Australia and New Zealand before the group disbanded in 2003. The Mollys played an eclectic mix of Irish, Mexican and American folk music using traditional instruments (penny whistle, mandolin, guitar, accordion, harmonica and bouzouki) and four-part vocals backed by electric bass and drums.

For the majority of The Mollys' existence, the band consisted of:
Nancy McCallion: lead vocals, guitar, penny whistle
Catherine Zavala: lead vocals, mandolin
Kevin Schramm: accordion, banjo, guitar, vocals
Dan Sorenson: bass
Gary Mackender: drums, vocals <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Mollys">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
