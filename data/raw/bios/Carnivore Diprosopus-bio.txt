When the line-up was complete the band started to write songs and decided to record a 3-track demo CD entitled "Sick Nurse". After that they played in Bogotá's Grind Death Fest II to be part of the CD compilation of the festival. They took also part in several other festivals such as Neiva Brutal Fest or [i[Cathedral Fest.
