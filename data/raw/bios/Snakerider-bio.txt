«Snakerider» is a promising project formed in the autumn of 2009 in Kiev, Ukraine by Daria (guitar) and Sergey (guitar/vocals) from Kasu Weri. 

Initially, as in the present Igor (Stoned Jesus, Krobak, Funeral of the Sun, Voida, Arlekin) on drums and supporting vocals and Vlad on bass. 

Successful debut performance in the trio format (Dasha, Sergei, Igor) on the Distorted Evening 2 consolidated group members in their intentions to play a stringy slimy stoner-doom in the best traditions of Electric Wizard and Ufomammut. Nowadays group is searching for new musicians to the full line-up, rehearsals, concerts and recording. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Snakerider">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
