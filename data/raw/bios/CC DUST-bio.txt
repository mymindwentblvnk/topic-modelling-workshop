CC DUST is a duo from Olympia, U.S.A. featuring Mary Jane Dunphe and David Jaques. They released debut 12" CC Dust in summer 2016, followed by Shinkansen No. 1 / New Ways EP in autumn the same year. 

Musically, CC Dust’s precedents might be considered the European synth pop originators of the early 80s, there’s also an abundance of low-end hooks played on baritone and bass guitars that teases the ear like early New Order productions, but in Dunphe’s passionate vocal performances there’s a close-to-the-bone reality that bypasses cool detachment.

CC Dust play and write real songs lived. A desire for desire. What is it? How does it manifest? Is it all worth the tumult? CC Dust offer no answers as there are none, but they ask the right questions in a life-affirming way. Doomed, romantic, unanswerable and vital. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/CC+DUST">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
