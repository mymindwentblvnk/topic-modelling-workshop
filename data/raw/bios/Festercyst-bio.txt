Festercyst started in the Winter of 2002 in Arizona. Pitch shifting was a strong element in the music. Drum programming was utilized due to lack of any reliable drummers. Pirated software was used in the recording process. To roughly fit this into a sub-genre, it would be a hybrid of aggressive Punk/Drum Machine Goregrind. 

Festercyst was spread amongst the internet, making it to Europe, Asia, The Americas, and who knows where else...

Point is, Festercyst (if any) has an occult following. If you have the pleasure to come across anything printed with the Festercyst name on it, it's probably bootlegged, unofficial, or a part of the small official release that will happen sometime in 2008.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Festercyst">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
