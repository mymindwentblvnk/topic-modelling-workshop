Born from previous bands and recording sessions, Kronus, is the brainchild of Christopher Penman, Danny Quayle (Maidenist) and other contributors.

2012 has seen the band working hard on their debut E.P, Human Onslaught, which will be ready upon completion for release in early 2014/15.

The band is now orchestrating their awesome material with new members, in order to take their brand of explosive power metal to the live stage!
