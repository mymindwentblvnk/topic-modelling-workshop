The convergence took place in March of 2005, at that time under the moniker Myth of Fire. Name change came about a year and a half later.

Neat stylistic categorization is difficult, feel free to set your own genre designations if you must.

As described by Mike Dyer of Crossroad Resonances :
“They will literally GASH your HOUND! If you’re looking for a heavy rock group with catchy lyrical hooks and abundant personality, then this is the band for you. Consistent, brutal, melodic: this band can keep up with the best of them and always delivers.”

All original members remain to this day, this will never change. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gash+Hound">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
