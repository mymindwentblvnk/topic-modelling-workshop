"IMBER LUMINIS was created officialy in 2009 by Déhà, but mainly, it has begun in 2006. The idea was to create a personnal world, mixing melodic slow metal with harsh and clean vocals. This is not really part from the DSBM scene, even it seems that it's better cased in this one. The concept is simply a catharsis of feelings about life, death, sorrow, pain, suffering, in a true melancholic way. A demostration, named "Fletus", apart concept of 39min of instrumental athmospheric metal in one piece, was released in autoproduction and for free in 2010. The next release is named "Life as Burden", and contains 4 long tracks of this special music, including a cover song of the too much known song "Sick of it all" by the band FINGER ELEVEN, completely done with IL's touch." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Imber+Luminis">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
