4 piece instrumental rock band from Los Angeles

Barrows fuses atmospheric and heavy music in the form of sprawling concept albums. The band creates entrancing, circling riffs and rhythms intercut with explosive peaks and brilliant subtleties.

"Red Giant", the sophomore album by Barrows is fittingly massive in thematic scope as it is in sonic heft. An album about the life of a star and what happens after it dies, the band depicts the stages of celestial death throughout the albumâ€™s five epic tracks. 

"Imprecari Island", the debut album by Barrows, is an intense musical jouney about a group of sailors who get shipwrecked on a cursed island. Their shipwreck, time on the island, and eventual escape is portrayed through the first eight tracks and is followed by the epic finale that takes place back out at sea, "Pirates". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Barrows">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
