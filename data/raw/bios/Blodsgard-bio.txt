Blodsgard is a Norwegian black metal band from 2006 that seeks to bring back the essence of True Norwegian Black Metal. Ambitious about their music and the progress of the genre, Blodsgard have aimed high with their debut album: "Monument" (released September 2013, The Oath records). Being a mix of classic Burzum, Satyricon and Gorgoroth with surprising elements of clear vocals in the core of their sound, Blodsgard is a modernistic band without losing the old school 90's raw blackmetal elements. Norways latest and greatest Black Metal band is called Blodsgard.
