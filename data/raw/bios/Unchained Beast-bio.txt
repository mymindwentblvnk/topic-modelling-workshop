Unchained Beast is a young band from Vardø, Norway located in the Northern Finnmark County.

Formed from the ashes of a Metallica tribute band – Unchained Beast have been together for a year and have been playing local gigs to establish a fan base.

Unchained Beast have a penchant for playing fast and loud! Their love for heavy metal shows in their songs and live performances. Previously, the band have had local newspaper coverage and performed at UKM – youth culture talent competition, where they reached the country finals in 2012!

The band has undergone some personnel changes in the past due to conflicts of interests and some bad blood has ultimately inspired the song ‘Fury Consumes’, which was released in late summer of 2011.

In early 2012, they released their third song, Gates of Dumbr. The lyrics are centered around Finnmark and their hometown Vardø back in the 1600's, when the witch hunts were happening. Months later they released a softer, slower paced song "Spear of Vac", that had more personal themes, written by drummer John-Vidar.

The future of the band is to keep writing songs, playing live and to get bigger! They hope to release their debut EP soon and to keep on rockin’! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Unchained+Beast">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
