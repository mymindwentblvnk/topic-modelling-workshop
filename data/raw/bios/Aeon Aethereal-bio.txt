Aeon Aethereal is a death/thrash metal band from Estonia. It was formed by two brothers - Ott and Ove in February 2004. Soon after drummer Dan and guitarist Silver joined the band, bassist Andres was found in summer 2004. At that time the band went by the name BloodForge and played melodic death metal. 
In 2006 the band started working on new material, and as the new tracks differed greatly form the earlier work, a change in name took place - Aeon Aethereal replaced BloodForge. 

Aeon Aethereal's melody-based blackish death metal is influenced by a range of artists from Nevermore to At The Gates to Opeth. 

Aeon Aethereal released their debut album, titled Parasite Halls, on July 22, 2008.

In August 2009 the band parted ways with long-time bass player Andres, who was replaced by Markus.
