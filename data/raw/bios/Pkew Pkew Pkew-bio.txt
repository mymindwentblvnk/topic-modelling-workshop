Pkew Pkew Pkew are a group of four animatronic robots found abandoned by teenagers partying in a warehouse.

The teenagers unexpectedly gave the band life after accidentally dropping a slice of pepperoni pineapple pizza into a standing puddle of spilt PBR tall boys.

Pkew Pkew Pkew awoke enraged. They devoured the teenagers and stole their skateboards, escaping the warehouse tomb and skating into the night.

Though badly corrupted by PBR and shitty pizza, the band discovered they could not escape their programming as Hillbilly Bear Jamboree rejects. Now the only thing that can satiate their bloodlust is the call of the road and rock 'n' roll. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pkew+Pkew+Pkew">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
