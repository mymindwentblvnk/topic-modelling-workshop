Opium Lord is a British doom metal band formed in 2012 in Birmingham, United Kingdom.

The band makes desolate doom metal and sludge with a coal black heart. Filthy grooves meet abrasive noise to convey a menacing atmosphere akin to the dodgiest drinking establishments. The original lineup features current-and-former members of Mothertrucker, History of the Hawk and Stinky Wizzleteat.
