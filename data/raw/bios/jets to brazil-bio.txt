Jets to Brazil was an American rock band. It was founded by Blake Schwarzenbach, former frontman of Jawbreaker, who found himself in Brooklyn, New York, after Jawbreaker disbanded. There he united with friend Jeremy Chatelain (who is not to be confused with the French singer of the same name); the two had met at the final Jawbreaker show, Chatelain himself having emerged from the break-up of Handsome.

Together they began working on four-track recordings aided by drum machines until they asked Chris Daly, previously the drummer for Texas Is the Reason, to join them. Daly created the name "Jets to Brazil" (perhaps taken from a poster seen in the film Breakfast at Tiffany's), and the band joined Jade Tree Records in 1997.

It was under Jade Tree that they recorded their first (and, following the successes of their previous bands, highly anticipated) album, Orange Rhyming Dictionary. Following its eventual success they went on to release Four Cornered Night, which introduced the fourth member of the band: former Van Pelt guitarist, Brian Maryansky. In 2002, Jets to Brazil launched their third — and what was to be final — album, Perfecting Loneliness. By 2003 the band had broken up, for unspecified reasons. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jets+to+Brazil">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
