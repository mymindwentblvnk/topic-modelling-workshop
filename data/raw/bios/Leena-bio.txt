1- Leena is a Italian dance artist produced by Alex «Latino» Zullo and Stefano «Colombo’s Touch».
She released the album «I Feel Fine» and several singles like "Gimme Love" and "All I Need".

2- Leena is an Australian singer. Her debut set of songs on the Mean Old Clock EP introduces a singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist with a sunny exterior, and, upon closer listen, a darker core. Tasmanian-born but a Perth girl at heart, she's travelled the globe, recorded from Bronte to Burbank and worked a charmingly odd array of jobs along the way. She's currently selling bespoke suits in Melbourne by day and writing her somewhat world-weary songs at night, as well as playing supports slots for artists including Bob Evans, Lior, Skipping Girl Vinegar, and Rufus Wainwright.

The songs on the EP are the result of sessions with a three different but esteemed producers: ARIA-winner Josh Pyke, Joe Chiccarelli (The Shins, Tori Amos, My Morning Jacket), and Mike Daly (Whiskeytown). With hints of the sophistication of Neil Finn, the moxie of Jenny Lewis, and the wistfulness of Cat Power, Leena's songs show us she's a hopeful observer and a thoughtful old soul.
