“After playing across the college circuit and the renowned metal supporting venues in India, we will now be launching our awaited debut EP at Blue Frog Metal Night on the 10th of July,” said Vishal Aditya Potluri, the band’s guitarist. “The EP was written over a span of nine months and was recorded in three weeks at Four Zone Music, Mumbai. The main motive is to spread the music to places where the band has not been heard, and, more importantly to play live at those places in the near future, which we hope will be achieved because of the EP.”

In addition to Potluri, the band also consists of Aditya Amladi (guitar), Pratik Kulgod (drums), Kaushik Desai (vocals) and Dhruv Kapoor (bass). Vizia, whose tagline is “express what you can, scream what you can not,” formed in September 2009, and has been playing live at various shows including at Harmonix 2011, Indiafestation at B69, Metrock 2011, and Metal Invasion at B69. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/ViZiA">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
