Idyll Swords are an instrumental band in the Chicago post-rock vein (Gastr del Sol, Tortoise, etc), but actually hail from Chapel Hill, NC. They also use a wide range of 'world instrumentation' in quite non-traditional ways which gives their instrumentals a real edge.
Band members include Dave Brylawski, Grant Tennille and Chuck Johnson and they have produced two albums to date, the first is "Idyll Swords" and the second called simply "II" and released on the Communion Label. Dave Brylawski used to play guitar in Polvo, and Grant Tennille has done session work with Trans Am. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Idyll+Swords">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
