Gabor Schablizki (AKA Robag Wruhme) was one-half of Wighnomy Brothers, a collaborative project for which Schablizki handled the production. The project came to an end in the early months 2010, leaving Schablitzki to work on his solo work as Robag Wruhme. The sound of Wruhme is distanced somewhat from his previous work; while Wighnomy Brothers' material possessed a high-energy, dancefloor aesthetic, Whrume material is subtle, and more delicate. Over the years, releases have landed on Kompakt, Musik Krause, and Pampaâ€”and it was a blissful Thora Vukk, full-length from 2011 that really captured the wider world's attention. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Robag+Wruhme">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
