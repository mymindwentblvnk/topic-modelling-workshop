HEAD OF THE TAURUS play some epic, loud and heavy Sludge/Post-Metal Music in the style of ISIS, PELICAN and NEUROSIS. So if your fans of those bands then you will seriously dig these guys just as much.

They have been together since 2008 and have released 4 releases since then. Check out their excellent BandCamp  Page.

It has links where you can listen to and buy all their releases. You can download their "Compilation (2008-2009) for free and their newest release "Demo 2011" for free as well. 

"Demo 2011" is the guys' best release yet. Fully recorded live. 3 tracks on for 34 minutes or so. Not one note out of place. Just brilliantly played live.

"Demo 2011" production is immense. Loud, Clear and heavy as the way Sludge/Post-Metal should be.

3 Excellent tracks that you will be hitting the repeat button for. Especially the 13:37 minute epic "Impact".
