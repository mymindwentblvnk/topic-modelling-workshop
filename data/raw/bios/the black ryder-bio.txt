Taking a dark, sultry approach to shoegaze, the Black Ryder formed in 2007 after vocalists/multi-instrumentalists Aimee Nash and Scott Von Ryper departed from the Morning After Girls. Originally from Sydney, Australia, the pair collaborated with members of Brian Jonestown Massacre, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, Swervedriver and the Church on their 2009 full-length debut Buy the Ticket, Take the Ride. The album won widespread acclaim: Along with being named one of Rolling Stone Australia's 50 Best Albums of the Year, tracks from it were featured on television shows such as House and Damages. Around that time, Nash collaborated with Black Rebel Motorcycle Club on the song "Done All Wrong," which appeared on the Twilight: New Moon soundtrack. In 2010, Mexican Summer released Buy the Ticket, Take the Ride in the US, while Von Ryper and Nash moved to Los Angeles and began working on its follow-up. They self-produced 2015's even more epic-sounding The Door Behind the Door, releasing it on their own Anti-Machine Machine label. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Black+Ryder">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
