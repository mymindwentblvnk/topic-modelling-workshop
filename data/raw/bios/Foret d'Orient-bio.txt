Foret D'Orient is an atmospheric black metal band from Venice, Italy enriched with deathly riffs, orchestral parts and acoustic inserts. Also used is a 47 string harp playing alongside metal structures. Foret D'Orient's lyrics are in Italian and Latin because the lyrics deal with the country's obscure cultural themes and history which deserve to be honored in the mother-tongue.


Essedvm is like the ancient Latin war machine, but also resembles the Ursa Major constellation that inspires the band. Essedvm's lyrics and concepts are inspired by the romance Esotericism and ancient Italic hidden episodes rediscovered and given dignity through the music.


The first release of Foret D'Orient, "Essedvm" will be available through Archaic North Entertainment on November 18th 2011. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Foret+D%27Orient">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
