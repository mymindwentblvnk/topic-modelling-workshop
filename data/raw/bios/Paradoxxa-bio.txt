Formerly Mexican (Tijuana, Baja California), Paradoxxa were an American death/thrash metal band from San Diego, California, active from 1994 to 1997. Their only release was the 1996 demo "Mito o Paradoja", although they were working on a new release called "Jardin de Tortura" in early 1997, until they had problems with their label and the band called it quits.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Paradoxxa">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
