Sepulchre is a black metal / crust punk / death metal band from Toronto, Canada , formed 2008, and includes current / former members of (Megiddo) and (Legion 666). Taking influence from such bands as Hellhammer, Amebix, Bathory, Deviated Instinct, Axegrinder, Sacrilege, Hellbastard, Antisect, and Onslaught, Sepulchre brews up a vintage mixture of metallic savagery and brittle crust, boarding the informal 'stenchcore' genre.
