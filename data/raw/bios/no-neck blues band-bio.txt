The No-Neck Blues Band, also known as NNCK, is a seven-member free-form improvisational musical collective from New York City. Formed in 1992, the original band was of eight members (until vocalist John Fell Ryan left to found Excepter, a more electronic-driven band of fellow travelers), and has lived, practiced, and performed in a space in West Harlem -- known as the Hint House -- since the late '90s. The group prefers to remain anonymous, though actual membership includes Dave Nuss, Keith Connolly, Dave Shuford, Jason Meagher, Pat Murano, Matt Heyner, and Michiko.  Side projects of various members include Angelblood, Eye Contact, Izititiz, K. Salvatore, Enos Slaughter, Suntanama, Egypt is the Magick #, Test, Coach Fingers, Under Satan's Sun, Amolvacy, and D. Charles Speer.

Their recordings have previously been released on their own in-house label, Sound at One Records, and all recordings have a "S@1" catalog number. Their early records appeared on labels like Ecstatic Yod and New World of Sound, while singles have been released on Dry Leaf Disks (UK), New World of Sound, and Ecstatic Peace. Their first studio album was Sticks and Stones May Break My Bones but Names Will Never Hurt Me, produced by Jerry Yester (of the Lovin' Spoonful) for  John Fahey's Revenant Records after a particular interest on Fahey's part. NNCK took a definite step into consumerist recordings with Qvaris on 5RC described only as an experiment that could be undone if the band so decided. They recently released Embryonnck, a CD/LP collaboration between NNCK and the German band Embryo on Staubgold Records, as well as the recent small-run CDRs Aftypiclipse and Angelo Mai. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/No-Neck+Blues+Band">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
