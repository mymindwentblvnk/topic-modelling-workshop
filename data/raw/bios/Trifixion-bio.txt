There exists at least four bands known by this name:

1. Technical death metal band from the U.K.

2. Experimental Death Metal band from Italy (Piacenza, Emilia-Romagna), released two demos and one album 


3. One man Black Metal project of Trifixion of the Horned God, the former drummer of Summoning (1993-95), and part time member of Pazuzu (1994-95). He completely disappeared from the Austrian BM scene after completing "The First and the Last Commandment" album and his current activities/whereabouts are unknown. Session guitars were played by Trifixion's girlfriend at the time.

4. Existing for a brief period in the mid 1990s, Trifixion of Venezuela harnessed the sound and spirit of their more renowned Brazilian neighbors far to the southeast. Their two demos, Crucificados (1995) and Demo 1996, are a snapshot of a truly obscure and forgotten scene, now unearthed for a new audience. These recordings are certain to please fans of Sarcófago, Necrófago, and Death Yell. Nuclear War Now! reissued both demos on 12-inch vinyl format in 2021. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Trifixion">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
