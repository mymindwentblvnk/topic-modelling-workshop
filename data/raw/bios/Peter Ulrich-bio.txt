Peter Ulrich is the former drummer/percussionist of Dead Can Dance and a contributor to 4AD's This Mortal Coil project. In 1999 he released his first solo album - Pathways and Dawns - on the Projekt label, and this was followed in 2005 by his current album -  Enter The Mysterium - on the City Canyons label. Peter's solo albums have gathered many great reviews, and his music - noted for its haunting melodies and atmospheric soundscapes - is widely expected to find its way into film or TV soundtracks in due course. Peter is currently working on compositions for his third solo album, also to be released under the City Canyons imprint - though no release schedule has yet been set.
