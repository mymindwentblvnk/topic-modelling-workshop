Icarus Tide are a deathcore band from Hertford, in Hertfordshire. Fronted by Dan Muncer's visceral and gutteral lyrics, the band's guitarists Luke Charman and Matt Pugh deliver an accurate and technical harmonised assault that's as beautiful as it is powerful. Darren Robertson's warming bass riffs add a huge amount of depth to the sound, and Greg Ward's speedy drumming wraps up a package that could well take a lot of people by surprise in 2007.
