The opening track is titled "I Used To Have An En Suit". Other tracks include "He's Trippi" and "Happy Hr". "He's Trippi" was influenced by Zayn Malik's "She".

On 14 September 2018, Sakima released the single "Holy Water" from his upcoming debut album Project Peach scheduled for release in 2019. Joshua Bote of Billboard describes "Holy Water" describes the song "with a reverb-and-trap-heavy fog surrounding him, he treads through self-love as a spiritual exercise, in effect, turning RuPaulâ€™s iconic mantra into a prayer of sorts". His single "Apps" was inspired by hookup culture and the relationship complications caused by dating apps. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sakima">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
