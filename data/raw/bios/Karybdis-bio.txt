Taking their name from the mythical sea creature in Homers Odyssey Karybdis aim to create waves of their own. The Anglo-French-Indian quintet play a powerful, unpretentious blend of melodic death metal, thrash and hardcore and are looking to build on an already formidable live reputation in 2010.
Guitarist Pierro Dujardin and drummer Mitch McGugan formed Karybdis in late 2008 after leaving their previous bands to pursue something much heavier. Pierros childhood friend and veteran of the French underground metal scene Gil Renault was added on vocals along with Harsha Dasari (guitar) and Jay Gladwin (ex-Shut Your Eyes And Youll Burst Into Flames) on bass. After an intensive writing period Karybdis recorded a 3-track EP with Tariq Mattar (Megadeth, Iron Maiden) and began playing regularly across London.
Karybdis returned to the studio at the start of 2010 to record their debut EP "War For Land".
After recording a single with Russ Russell (Napalm Death, Dimmu Borgir, Evile) Karybdis recorded a video, which is now available on their youtube channel and iTunes.
Unfortunately, Gil Renault had to leave the band due to personal issues in July 2011, but has been replaced by a vocal powerhouse called Rich O'Donnell. Rich has definitely brought his own sound with him to Karybdis, and given their music a music heavier feel.
Karybdis will be returning to the studio with Russ Russell to record their debut album in December 2011, which will be released in early 2012.

Stay tuned!
