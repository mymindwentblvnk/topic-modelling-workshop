There has been more than one band called The Preachers, including an American band of the 60s and a Swedish garage punk band of the 80s. 

To compare Sydney newcomers The Preachers to any musical acts would be unfair. Not that they don’t have their influences (Think Patti Smith and Wolfman Jack with a dash of Fleetwood Mac) but their live show is more reminiscent of a religious cult. From the howling voodoo high priest Gideon Bensen to the Magdeline-esque passion of Isabella Manfredi, the voices in this band stir up a religious fervor that makes you want to drink the kool aid and wait for the spaceship. And after only one year together and the release of a self-titled EP, The Preachers are embarking on a project that flicks the finger to all expectation. Dubbed ‘The 66 Project: Six Songs in Six Months’ it sees the band in collaboration with local artists, filmmakers, and producer Tony Buchen (Tim Finn, WIM) to release free music until May 2011.
