Weltenschwaerzer is a one man Black Metal project by Werner Mortensen (vocals, lyrics, guitar, bass, drums) from Germany. His debut release "Abkehr" features mostly fast and aggressive riffs but also some slow/atmospheric parts, especially in the last track. Lyrically Mortensen predominantly deals with detaching from worldly existence, human misery, violence, death and anti-theism. Originally Weltenschwaerzer was a three man band in which Mortensen was playing the bass/singing only. Due to differences over Mortensen's lyrics and stance towards supernaturalist beliefs the guitarist and the drummer left the band. In an interview with BELLVM GERITE he stated: "They were into the whole satanic non-sense and wanted to make it part of the music. I deeply despise all forms of religion and theism so there was no way it was going to work out. Even atheistic satanism is inacceptable to me because it makes use of religious supernaturalist imagery." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Weltenschwaerzer">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
