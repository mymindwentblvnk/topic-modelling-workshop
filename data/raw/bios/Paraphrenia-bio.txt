At least three bands use the name Paraphrenia

1.) Paraphrenia was a one-woman dark ambient / depressive black metal project from North Wales that originally was known as 'Skog' from 2004-early 2006, changing the name to Paraphrenia in mid-2006. The project consisted only of Genevieve as 'Asmoragoth'. The 'Provigil' demo was entirely instrumental, though there were plans to mix vocals from Genevieve's friend, Isabelle, into the 'Gossamer Beauty' EP but that never happened due to personal reasons and was released devoid of vocals. She was also involved in Nocturnal Necropsy and a solo dark ambient / noise project, Beyond The Asylum as 'Patient 232'. Travelling to southern England, she committed suicide in early November 2012 at Beachy Head, East Sussex.
Discography:
• Provigil Demo 2006 — Limited to 17 CD-R copies released on her own label, 'Churchfall' 
• Gossamer Beauty EP 2008 — Limited to 30 cassettes released on her own label, 'Churchfall'
• Suffocated By Paranoia EP (planned for 2009; two tracks recorded but never released due to mental health issues and life events)
(Both the demo and EP were distributed primarily amongst friends and known associates, now typically only available and distributed via digital format on P2P programs from those that transferred the work digitally.)

2.)  A lo-fi/twee project from Jordan, by Pazi/Luma, mostly solo work. She was one of the founders of a Riot Grrrl/grunge/metal girl-band "The Jetts" that disbanded in 2010. Her first EP was digitally released in 2013 "Rive" which could be found on Bandcamp.com.
