Papa M is the moniker of David Pajo, an American musician, originally from Louisville, Kentucky, United States.  He first started guitaring in the early 1980s, going on to win cult recognition with the pioneering post-rock outfit Slint (1986-1990). During the 1990s, Pajo played with King Kong, The Palace Brothers, Stereolab, Royal Trux, The For Carnation, Tortoise and Bonnie 'Prince' Billy. He is also featured on many of their early records.

In 1995, Pajo started the M franchise, issuing a single and a split single in short order. As Aerial M, he released several singles, a self-titled album and a remix album. As Papa M, he produced three full-length albums, the first of them, Live from a Shark Cage, in 1999.

In 2002, Pajo joined Billy Corgan's Zwan, with whom he released an album and toured the world for two years. It was during this time that he started the Papa M singles series.

Hole of Burning Alms appeared in 2004 - to date, the last Papa M record. This collected Aerial M and Papa M sides to form another long-playing link in the M chain.

Since then, he has recorded as Pajo. His self-titled first release came in the summer of 2005 - a collection of solo recordings made on the road. He then released the home recording 1968, as part of a Pajo trilogy. The final album was Scream With Me, a collection of acoustic Misfits covers. This album was only released on vinyl and download. He has played live as Pajo very sparingly, a few dates dotted around the globe.
