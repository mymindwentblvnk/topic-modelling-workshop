Defessus started in winter of 2008. In that time, the band has released two EP's, "I Will Light The Sky" and "The Great Destroyers." After several line-up changes, the core four members are Jake Draper on vocals, John Kitchen on guitar, Zack Harmon on bass, and Jimmy Denison on drums. The band has also recruited guitarist Ben Taber to play live. 

Defessus now is a new page. A completely blank slate. The band is abandoning their melodic metalore and melodic death metal leanings; and taking on brutality, technicality, dissonance, and passion. The melody remains, but now the band is much more aggressive and calculated. Time signatures change several times throughout the songs, and the musicians use every part of their instrument equally. 

Defessus is not a breakdown band, nor are they a technical death metal. It's deathcore on paper. A mix of all forms of hardcore, be it Converge or Strike Anywhere, and death metal of all kinds. The band hopes to record another EP by summer 2010, and have a full length in the works by the end of the year. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Defessus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
