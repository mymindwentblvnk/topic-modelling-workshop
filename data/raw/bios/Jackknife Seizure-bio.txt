BIO:
In 2009, Crowback & Mit created Jackknife Seizure. 2010 saw Sylvy and Gerry complete the line-up. After a couple years of writing, demoing and gigging, their first feat of arms is about to be released. In the meantime, catch one of their gigs and throw yourself into the seizure! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jackknife+Seizure">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
