Sidney Royel Selby III (born May 3, 1997), better known by his stage name Desiigner, is an American hip hop recording artist from Brooklyn, New York. He rose to prominence when his debut single "Panda", reached number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. In February 2016, fellow American rapper Kanye West (who sampled "Panda" for his seventh album The Life of Pablo), announced Desiigner's signing to his GOOD Music imprint, under the aegis of Def Jam Recordings.

His debut mixtape New English was released on June 26th 2016 to mixed and negative critical reception. Shortly after this, he released another single, titled Tiimmy Turner, based off of an XXL Freestyle. He is set to release a full album later this year. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Desiigner">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
