"Grand Demise of Civilization hails from the upper midwest hub known as the Twin Cities of Minnesota. An area that has a long history of being rich with many forms of music. Our intention is to add something wicked to the mixture.

Our history and lineage dates back to some of the earliest times of dark and forboding sound. Our members have seen many things and many places. The goal is always the same, expand and expound upon what has been created. Take the pathways and roadways that have been created by those that stood before us and use them wisely.

Conceptually, GDoC is built around dark ideology and designs. Ranging from modern tragedies, historical consequences, sheer disdain for religious philosophies, far reaching armeggedon principles, and other diabolic dabblings, we have very few restrictions in our bag of maniacal tricks. 

What is the nature of our sound, you might ask?

The standard operating practice of a metal band is to lay out some lavish depiction of the strength of their music. GDoC does not adhere to these practices. To run one's mouth is to act a fool and appear as yet another simple animal amongst the herd. The music speaks for itself. If you need an explanation, you have missed the reason behind the genre entirely. That being said, if you are inclined to assumption based on text and need some form of description, I give you the words most commonly used ... HELL METAL." (from the band's website.)
