There are 6 bands with the name Rot:

1. Rot was one South Americas most prominent grindcore acts; formed in October 1990 and hailing from São Paulo, Brazil. As opposed to most extreme Brazilian bands of the time, Rot belonged to the 'socio-political' grindcore scene, in terms of their lyrics and themes. As stated by the band, "The lyrical part is very important to the band, showing a very sceptical, sarcastic and radical feeling towards life and society in general. Although the band was labelled as political we never felt like this since we have a lot of personal and philosophical issues that makes the band identity even stronger". After hundreds of gigs and releasing four full-length records, two compilations, innumerable Singles, EPs / Split LPs / EPs / CDs / Tapes - with such bands as Agathocles, Psycho, Yacøpsæ, Mesrine, Catheter, etc. - Rot eventually called it quits in 2008.
