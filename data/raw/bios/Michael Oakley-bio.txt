Scottish singer/producer Michael Oakley’s moody, melancholic synthwave/retrowave sound made its debut on the 2017 hit album California.

While at high school in the 1990’s, Oakley discovered his sister’s 1980s synth-pop record collection and fell in love with artists such as New Order, Pet Shop Boys, Depeche Mode and Tears For Fears.

This inspired Oakley to buy a synthesizer and start making electronic music of his own, however it wasn’t until the release of his 2016 single's Rabbit In The Headlights and Turn Back Time that he found his sound. 

Debut album California was released on October 6th 2017 to critical acclaim and was featured on NewRetroWave’s top 10 albums of 2017 list and The Huffington Post. Propellerhead Software also did an artist feature shortly after the release of California as Michael is a well known user of their software program ‘Reason’.
