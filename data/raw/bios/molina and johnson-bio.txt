Jason Molina and Will Johnson had to find each other sooner or later. Both singer/songwriter, blessed with a voice that can break your heart. Both making music since halfway 1990s, as prolific do-it-yourself-musicians. Jason Molina solo and with his band Magnolia Electric Co., releasing numerous albums, EPs and singles a year, and always on tour. Even before that he performed withe cult-legends Songs: Ohia. Will Johnson with Centro-Matic and South San Gabriel, and also solo. Both singer/songwriters have earned a lot of respect from the fans of raw, vulnerable, American indie folk. This year they made a record together, wich they're now supporting with a joint live show. A unique collaboration of two godfathers of bare folk. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Molina+and+Johnson">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
