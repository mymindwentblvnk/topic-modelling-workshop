Legionary is a 5 piece Death/Thrash metal band with members hailing from both New York and New Jersey.

The band was established in 2006 by drummer Frank D'Erasmo (Rizen). Although Frank put an album to works immediately, It wasn't until early 2010 that a complete line up had been achieved.

With contributions from Tony Barhoum on lead guitar, Alonso Maguino on rhythm guitar, Mike Carra on bass, and Tim Rocheny on vocals, the album finally resonated into the masterwork that it is today. It consists of 10 pulverizing tracks, each of which has their own riveting identity.

Legionary's self titled demo was released in early September 2010. The demo includes their two original tracks "Deceiver" and "Awakening Reprisal". The full length album is expected to be released some time in 2011. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Legionary">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
