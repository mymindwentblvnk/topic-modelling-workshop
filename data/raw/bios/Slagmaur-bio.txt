Always preferring to let their music do the talking, SLAGMAUR have always refused to explain who they are and what they are about.  

Hailed as one of the best things to come out of the Norwegian Black Metal scene for many years SLAGMAUR is a band known for using a variety of both classical and “metal” instruments that create layer upon layer of sinister sounds and eerie atmospheres, and defies any kind of categorisation within the Black Metal genre.
