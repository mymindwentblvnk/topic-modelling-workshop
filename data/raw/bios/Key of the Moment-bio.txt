Key Of The Moment was formed by former Orphaned Land (“Mabool”) keyboardist and producer, Eden Rabin , who was seeking to create a new genre in metal. The new genre incorporates heavy guitar and drums with various musical-styles such as: Jazz, Flamenco, Latin-music and even classical music.  

For this mission, Eden addressed Rimon Institute for Jazz and contemporary music, recruiting top musicians such as Tal Cohen (drums), Kfir Melamed (bass), Amit Dreizin (guitars) and Michal Akrabi (vocals).  

Those were later replaced by Vocalist Iris Sternberg (also a “Rimon” scholar, and a renowned singer in Israeli pop-music), Guitarist Alon “Tewl” Tamir (ex- Project RnL), and bassist Jonathan Maimon (who played with Eden in the jazz-fusion group, Right On Time).  

Together they make one of the most original and promising prog-metal bands around. With complex yet catchy songs, versatility, and originality, Key Of The Moment’s debut full-album (“The Switch”) received overwhelming reviews world-wide. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Key+of+the+Moment">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
