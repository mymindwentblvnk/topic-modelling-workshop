The band comes to life in 1999 in Asti, Italy with the aim of proposing their own music, mixing the musical tastes of all the components of the group.

Madwork music immediately reaches the heart of listener for the perfect balance of heavy riffs and melancholic arpeggios, distorted bass, dark and electronic atmospheres, airy openings and catchy vocal melodies.

Entusiastically reviewed worldwide for their first album Overflow, Madwork return with a preview of its new sound and a full set of killer songs, as they are used to compose and perform in live gigs.
