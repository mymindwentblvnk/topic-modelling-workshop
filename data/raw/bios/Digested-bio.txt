Digested was born on June 6th 2008 during the Obituary show in Israel. Attended the show Ze'ev Levin, Roei Zilberfarb (then a singer for the hardcore band Batterya) and Aviel Ben David. These three thought it would be a good idea to team up and form a brutal death metal band. In the final days of July same year, founding members brought in Aviram Levy, Peleg Mazuz and Rubi Morales. About a week later Roei asked to put the band on hold for personal reasons. Meanwhile, the rest of the members did not abandon the idea. In late January 2009, Roei and the hardcore band Batterya parted ways. In mid March, Roei announced he was available to start working on making Digested a force in the metal scene. Meanwhile Rubi Morales decided to leave the forming lineup. The band began working on lyrics for songs and started coming up with riffs. In the beginning of April 2009 the band added Ronen Zalevas to take over the drum sticks. With Ronen on board the band surged forward and on May 1st 2009 the band has officially become active,playing it's first rehearsal. On June 12th the band and vocalist Aviram Levy parted ways due to professional and personal differences. On July 16th Walid officially joined the band. He'll be sharing guitar roles with Peleg. As of Septemnber 20th, the band started a new and important period.The vocalist Aviram rejoined the band,looks like the brutal machine that is Digested,just turned even more brutal. In the end of 2009, the band parted ways with Ze'ev Levin.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/digested">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
