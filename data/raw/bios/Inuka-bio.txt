Inuka is a doom metal band from Singapore. The band was formed in 2014 by vocalist Florence Lee, guitarist Jordy Samuel, bass player Antonio Lee (former bass player and songwriter of the heavy metal band Supertzar) and drummer Davis Chew.

Faithful to the foundation laid down by Black Sabbath, the band blends the traditional doom styles of Pentagram, Witchfinder General, Pagan Altar, Saint Vitus and Trouble with the epic/goth doom styles of Candlemass and Type O Negative. Inuka is perhaps the most accurate representation of doom metal in the region.
