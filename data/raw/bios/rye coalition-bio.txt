From the seedy back alleys of Jersey City explodes RYE COALITION, beloved saviors of rock n' roll! The boys are back with their long awaited fourth full-length Curses, produced by the one and only Dave Grohl. Curses, if you can believe it, is another bold step forward from their previous efforts, deftly wielding the power of 70's hard rock backed up by a distinct modern punk aesthetic. The guitars are on fire, the bass throbs, and the drums are positively Bonham-esque. Lather on a rock n' roll frontman with a voice like Paul Stanley dipped in bourbon, a generous sprinkling of sardonic wit, and RYE is the recipe you're after.


   Way before this new wave of American hard rock came back into vogue, RYE COALITION was kicking out the rock jams. Never following trends- be it the skinny ties, the electro beat, that 'emo' hairstyle, or whatever it is this week- the band's reputation as master of its own destiny will forever remain untarnished. The fact that these five close high school friends have weathered years on the road, label ups and downs, and countless challenges of faith, preserving the precious bonds of friendship through it all. Well, it's a testament to why they got started in the first place. Their love of music.

   Let this band of brothers, consisting of of singer Ralph Gregory Cuseglio, guitarist Jon Gonnelli, drummer David Anthony Leto, bassist Justin Angelo Morey, and guitarist Herbert Joseph Wiley V be your guides through the tangled and mysterious rock and roll jungle of their own making. And if you're lucky enough to get lost inside, you just might hear your own exasperated snarls. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rye+Coalition">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
