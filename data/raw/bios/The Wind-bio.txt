The Wind is a vocally driven, indie rock band from Southern California. The group consists of Chad Marshman (guitar, piano, vocals), Kevin Jaemes (guitar, piano, vocals), and brothers Chip (drums, percussion, vocals) and Nick (bass, vocals) Knechtel. Their “sound has been likened to the Beatles” with “hints of the Beach Boys and Queen,” "60’s drug rock mixed with modern indie stylings,” and “sunny-sweet Vaudeville-style pop.”

Their first recording, Histor (originally released under the title "Goes to Austin James Land"), is a 7 song self-produced E.P. This recording received mostly positive reviews, deemed as “tak[ing] your traditional indie rock and [making] it a production.”

They have been in the studio for much of 2010, self-recording and producing their biggest project yet, a twenty-three song double album entitled Harum-Scarum. The release date is set for early November 2010.
