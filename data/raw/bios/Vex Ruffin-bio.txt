Vex Ruffin grew up between California’s Inland Empire and Alabang, Manila in the Philippines and makes ‘Original Pilipino Music’ (OPM). Vex’s OPM draws on and smooths out the complex interplay between the American, the Filipino and other eclectic Pacific Rim musical influences that have seeped into the mix over the last three decades. Family is ever-present in Filipino culture - relationships with loved ones are a central theme in Vex’s music.

On paper, Vex Ruffin’s music is simple: an untrained punk musician who uses a few basic instruments in uncomplicated ways. He calls the style ‘minimalist.’ Although it may not seem like it upon first listen, Vex’s music is rooted in sampling and hip hop beat-making culture. The SP 303 sampler provides the drums and other sounds, a purchase inspired by Madlib.

Vex is the first and only artist signed to Stones Throw Records on the strength of an unsolicited demo sent through the mail. Peanut Butter Wolf recalls, “It was kind of a fluke that I listened. I just liked the drawing on the cover so I decided to check it out. I called the phone number on the CD and Vex thought I was his friend playing a practical joke.” <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vex+Ruffin">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
