Hailing from Atlanta, but falling into the so-called ‘SoundCloud rap’ scene due to his collaborations with the likes of XXXTentacion, Smokepurrp, and Wifisfuneral, Bans balances trap-rapping with a more melodic sound. Given that, it’s perhaps no surprise that he signed to Future’s Freebandz label in late 2017, which followed him dropping five EPs: Yung Bans Volumes 1-5.

Born in 1999, Bans grew up listening to the likes of Chief Keef, Tyler The Creator, Lil Wayne and Young Scooter.

In late 2017, Bans told XXL his single “Lonely” featuring Lil Skies is “probably” his favorite song he’s made. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Yung+Bans">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
