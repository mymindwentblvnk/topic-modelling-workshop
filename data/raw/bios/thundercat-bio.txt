Stephen Lee Bruner, stage name Thundercat (b. October 19 1984, Los Angeles, CA, USA) is a virtuoso bassist, composer, producer and singer. Born into a family of musicians, his brother and he were part of legendary thrash punks Suicidal Tendencies (since 16 years of age) - Bruner has collaborated with many, including jams with Snoop Dogg, Kendrick Lamar, Mac Miller and Stanley Clarke. 

“I do believe that hip-hop can be the new jazz, and I’m helping create that”, Bruner said in an interview to Bass Player, in 2008.

He is part of the new generation of jazz literate, hip-hop loving instrumentalists who can play beyond traditional limits - a mutant jazz cat - and that’s how 'Thundercat' (a monicker he chose), suits him well (even if it’s purely the result of an unhealthy cartoon addiction dating back to childhood). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Thundercat">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
