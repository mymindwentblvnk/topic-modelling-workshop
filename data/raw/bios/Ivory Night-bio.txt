Ivory Night is a band coming from Kaiserslautern, Germany. It was formed in the mid-90's. Their name combines the brightness of ivory and the darkness of the night to sum up the spectrum of their music.
They may play mainly Heavy, but have also untypical elements of Rock, Blues, Progressive, Thrash and Grindcore. Their influences come from the behemoths of heavy metal like Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Helloween and Wishbone Ash. The guitarist Patrick Fuchs had once said: “We get bored quite quickly. That’s why we try to do something different all the time. This is what keeps us creative.”
The group claims that: "We intend to keep our music original, nevertheless free from all boring clichees and current hypes. We always want to further and progress our songwriting to enlarge the musical spectrum. The song itself and its individual characteristic are always the main aspect."
