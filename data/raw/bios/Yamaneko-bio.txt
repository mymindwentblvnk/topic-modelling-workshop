There are two artist known as Yamaneko.

1.  London-born producer and DJ, Joe Moynihan currently living in Tokyo, Japan. His first trilogy was a mix-album-mix combination that wrapped ambient, grime, new age and soundtrack influences around Pixel Wave Embrace, released on Local Action. Two years later, the London-based, bass-wide record label would release Yamaneko’s second album, Project Nautilus [Keygen Loops] – a meditation on melancholic keygen composition accompanied by mixes in the form of Nautilus Dawn and Nautilus Dusk. The artist also collaborated with Mr. Mitch as Yaroze Dream Suite and released a solo cut on Mumdance’s Different Circles imprint. Through Talbot Fade, Moynihan has further explored ambient compositions and remixes with releases on Truants and Local Action. As he goes on to explain in our interview below, his music is in part a means of coping with London living. Whilst life in the city is burdened by its reputation of urban loneliness amongst the many, the most pervasive themes and features in his works – tender openness and deep care – confront such isolation, transforming his music into something of a social, emotional panacea.

2. YamaNeko, later known as Sanae (さなえ) or YamaNeko Sanae (山猫さなえ), is a Japanese singer who uploads both original and cover songs to the NicoNico Douga website, most of which have been re-upload to YouTube by fans. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Yamaneko">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
