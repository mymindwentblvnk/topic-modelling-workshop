Galactic Cowboys are a heavy rock/metal band based in Houston, Texas. They combine progressive metal with a style of vocals influenced by The Beatles and the heavy playing style of thrash bands such as Anthrax.

Original members Monty Colvin (Bass, vocals), Alan Doss (Drums, vocals), Ben Huggins (Lead vocals, guitar), and Dane Sonnier (Guitar, vocals) released their self-titled album in 1991, with the follow-up "Space In Your Face" in 1993. Sonnier then decided to leave the group. The band returned in 1996 with album number three entitled "Machine Fish" on Metal Blade Records, along with new guitarist Wally Farkas.

It was in 1997 that they released "The Horse That Bud Bought", which was a minor departure for the band. They used a similar songwriting style but lightened the tone.  The music contained a more rock feel, with less metal leanings. The music for the next two albums, "At The End Of The Day" and "Let It Go" also were also similar in this regard. 

After 2000's "Let It Go" the Cowboys decided to disband. The former members of the band continued to be active in the music scene, until the original lineup reunited in 2017 for the album "Long Way Back to the Moon". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Galactic+Cowboys">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
