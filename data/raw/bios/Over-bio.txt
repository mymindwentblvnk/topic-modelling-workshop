Three bands use that name.

1) Over is a four piece post-punk/anarcho-punk/death rock band based out of Portland, Oregon. Over started in October 2016 in the age of creeping fascism with Lillian Void (Smoke Rings, Useless Eaters, Broken Spirit) and Justin Cory (Usnea, 1919) and quickly picked up members Andrew Grosse (Caravan Recordings, Billions and Billions) and Ruby Monet by December. Collective influences range from Doom to Shoegaze to Punk, with our most salient roots being in Anarcho-Punk and Post-Punk, giving Over sonic likeness to early era Siouxsie and the Banshees, Killing Joke, and Red Lorry Yellow Lorry.

3) OVER -based around the duo of JG and AD with a revolving collaborators and assistants, OVER is an entity dedicated to encapsulating dread through sound.Inspired by horror films,creaking doors, haunted houses and the moment where TV static takes on a sinister life of its' own. 

Though only having played a handful of gigs they have supported artists as diverse and challenging as legion of two, Drainland and Jean Louis Costes. Bring a blindfold.
