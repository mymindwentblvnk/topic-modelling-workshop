Laboratorium Pie≈õni (Song Laboratory) is a group of female singers from Poland, created in 2013.
Using traditional, polyphonic singing they perform songs from all over the world, mainly: Ukraine, Balkans, Poland, Belarus, Georgia, Scandinavia and many other places. They sing a capella as well as with shaman drums and other ethnic instruments (shruti box, kalimba, flute, gong, zaphir and koshi chimes, singing bowls, rattles etc.), creating a new space in a traditional song, adding voice improvisations, inspired by sounds of nature, often intuitive, wild and feminine. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Laboratorium+Pie%C5%9Bni">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
