Prassein Aloga (Πράσσειν Άλογα) was formed in early 1996 by Elias Petrogiannis - guitar and Tasos Economides - drums, adding Panos Barkopoulos - bass and Thanos Dimitrakoudis - vocals a couple of months later. Their creativity needs, led them to the recording of "Vasisou pano sou" on their own expences, which helped them sign to Virgin and was released in the winter of 1998. In 1999, after many live shows all over Greece, their second CD "O ehthros mou" (My enemy), distributed by Virgin too, led to another series of live shows. In 2002, Nikos Dimakidis took over the bass-player duties and after signing to Plus Rec. they released their third LP named "Thelo na sou miliso" (I want to talk to you). The band's sound is hard rock but embraces blues, funk, ethnic and dance elements too having song ranging from hard and aggresive to tender and soul searching ballads. In early 2005, Aggelos Gouzetos and Kostas Taltabanis became the new singer and basist respectively and during the summer of 2006 the band recorded ten songs that became "Prassein Aloga 4", released January 2007 by Ano Kato records. In the same time Giorgos Spiroglou become the keyboard player of the group. In 2009 the band went on recording their fifth and hardest - as far as it concerns their sound - LP named "Enas yperoxos kosmos" (A wonderful world)! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Prassein+Aloga">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
