'BETWEEN SUN & MOON' available on iTunes http://bit.ly/A4Dv6a

Before The War formed in late 2011 after changing the name and style of their previous group. The bandâ€™s new sound reflects a more rhythmic, progressive, indie style. Their EP 'Between Sun & Moon' was released on February 20, 2012 on iTunes and other digital retailers. The band is currently lining up tour dates for Summer 2012 and is also seeking a bass player.

Before The War has been featured on 102.1 Neighborhood Watch, 91.7 THE EDGE, and West Side Will Radio for multiple weeks straight.

"The music is both dark but inviting. A very interesting blend that works well for this young group! Amazing EP and the Full Length CD that comes after they can get together for a few weeks will be even better. Three songs is just a tease.." -Jack Hackett <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Before+the+War">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
