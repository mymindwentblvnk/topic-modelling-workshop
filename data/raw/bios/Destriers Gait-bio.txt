Destriers Gait formed in late 2005 as Subversion in their hometown of Dallas, TX. As they began to evolve and redefine their sound over and over again, they honed their writing and developed their own form of progressive metal with a mix of emotion and aggression that can only be described by their name.
Their self-titled EP was released in mid-2007 and after their tour van tragically burned down they had much to overcome. However, with the addition of a new vocalist, a new van, and a fresh new direction for their music, Destriers Gait has been clawing their way towards their goal with unmatched perseverance and determination.

Their debut record Hung, Drawn, and Quartered was released in September 2009. They are ready to take on the world and spread their music to all ends of the globe.
