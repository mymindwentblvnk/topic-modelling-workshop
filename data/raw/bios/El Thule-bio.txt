Bergamo, Italy
The band El-Thule was born at the base of Bergamos hills in September 2001 due to the shared interests of the three band members for rocknroll (in particular for the Swedish style and the seventies style) and stoner rock, and by the way even for the passion the three share for beer and pretty chicks that join their shows.
