Arriving at the end of the Krautrock explosion of the 1970s, Dunkelziffer was formed out of the original sessions that created the classic Phantom Band, and was centered around Dominik von Senger (Golf Channel), Reiner Linke and Helmut Zerlett, and with a cast of floating members that included Jaki Liebezeit, Damo Suzuki, Olek Gelba, Wolfgang Schubert, Stefan Krachten and Matthias Keul.

Having made four ground breaking albums over a 6 year period, they took their cue from the classic Krautrock triumverate of heavy repetitive drumming, intricate, overlapping melody and sonic intonation. Dunkelziffer then added dub, soul and jazz elements to expand the sound into the new decade. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dunkelziffer">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
