Woodtemple was founded in 1998 by Aramath who claims to be inspired by Graveland. Ideologically near to Graveland, Absurd or Thors Hammer, Woodtemple can be ranked among the NSBM movement. Their music though, focuses more on the evocation of a dark and hateful atmosphere integrated into a set of nature related topics.

In 1999 the first and only demo Swords of Hate was recorded. The demo can be associated more with Black Metal, but regardless already offers epic foundations. At the end of 2000 the demo was re-recorded as Aramath was not satisfied with the sound.
His next albums were Feel the Anger of the Wind (2002), The Call From The Pagan Woods (2004), Voices from the Pagan Mountains (2006) and Sorrow of the Wind (2008).
