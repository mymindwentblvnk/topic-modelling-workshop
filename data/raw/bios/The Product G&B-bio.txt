The Product G&B is an R&B duo consisting of Sincere (David McRae) and Money Harm (Marvin Moore-Hough). Originally known as "The Product", the two were discovered by Wyclef Jean while he was producing tracks for Carlos Santana's "Supernatural" album and subsequently signed to his Yclef record label.

Changing their name to "The Product G&B" (G&B standing for "Ghetto and Blues"), they were asked to perform on Santana's song "Maria Maria", which was released as a single and spent ten weeks at number one on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 in April 2000.

The Product G&B has also performed "Dirty Dancin'" with Carlos Santana

"Maria Maria" has so far been The Product G&B's only mainstream success, with the minor exception of "Cluck, Cluck". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Product+G&B">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
