Torrance, California (2000 - present) 

Founded in late 2000 and revived in 2010, Heavy Justice has always been a throw back to a time of unforgiving, hostile, yet strangely haunting style of metal that doesn't let us sleep at night - influenced by their metal heroes like Metallica, Pantera, Children of Bodom, and Dream Theater.  HEAVY JUSTICE's trademark sound includes multiple inter-weaving riffs, melodic, story-driven guitar solos, beautiful and severe vocal hooks teamed with classically-infused lyrical ideas written in original stories about the darker side of the human condition - pain, anger, sorrow, fear... all painted with the brush of true Heavy Metal qualities- intensity, aggression, and excitement!

Their very first official release was a self-titled EP in 2012 which included songs "FUEL INTO THE FIRE" and "GOLDDIGGER". On the upcoming album, they release those songs again in higher quality and with more attack than before - along with 7 NEW TRACKS including the vicious title track, "APOCALYZE", the heart-wrenching "I'M HOME", and earth-shattering power of "WHEN WE WERE GODS" featuring Julia Dettwiler of Los Angeles based rock band, Lunar Rogue. This is NOT an LP! Its a completely self-produced, FULL LENGTH ALBUM! A rare happening in this age of music! Apocalyze album is now available, released 31 December 2013.
