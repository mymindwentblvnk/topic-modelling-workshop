A symphonic black metal band from Belgium. The band was formed in 2000 and released a demo called "Into the Maelstrom" in 2001. Their music is highly influenced by Emperor and Marduk, though at times more symphonic. The band split up shortly after the demo was released. The demo itself is very rare (especially outside of Belgium) and limited to only a few copies.
