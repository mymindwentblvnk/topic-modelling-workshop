There are two artists/bands by the name of Frameworks.

1. Frameworks are a melodic hardcore band from Gainesville, FL. Forming in early 2011, they released their debut EP Every Day Is The Same, in October 2011. They incorporate elements of post-hardcore and screamo/skramz together, promoting their own brand of melody driven hardcore.

After receiving a small following from their debut EP Every Day Is The Same, they gained backing from 13th Floor Records, an independent record label from Fort Mill, SC. Through them they released their latest EP, Small Victories in February 2013.

Matthew Brewer aka Frameworks Hails Manchester (UK). Frameworks is live musicians, sampled then sequenced over elaborate rhythm sections building graceful and eloquent productions. As a drummer Matthew tends to spend a lot of time on the drum sounds to get the right "frame" to his musical work. Pure cinematic down-tempo boom bap production at its finest, reminiscent of Bonobo, Cinematic Orchestra, J Rawlsâ€™ Liquid Crystal Project, Tosca, Fourtet, Jon Kennedy.
