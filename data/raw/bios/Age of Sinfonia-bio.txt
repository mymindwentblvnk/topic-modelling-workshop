Heavy Metal was the heart of metal back in the old days. As the years progressed, so did the various subgenres of Metal. But when fused with classical and symphonic elements, a new sound was unearthed. In this anomalous genre pioneered by bands like Nightwish and Epica and loved by audiences of all kinds, comes a new era; an Age of Sinfonia.

AGE OF SINFONIA was founded in 2008 by brothers, guitarist Rasen and keyboard player Jack. Both shared a strong love for progressive metal, laced with classical music traditions; also known as symphonic metal.

After 2 years of line-up adjustments, the band now stands strong with the brothers and classical violinist JC, drummer Elfie, bassist Andy and operatic vocalist Savvia Lenore.

The members of Age of Sinfonia may come from varying musical backgrounds and influences - from classical, metal, ska, musical theatre and symphonic music and more- but this diversity engenders a unique creativity and sound that defies simple categorization. 

Age of Sinfonia has performed at events like Street Fest, Metal for a Cause, Youth Olympic Games and more, and has recently completed the recording of their debut album slated for release in early 2011.

The band was recently selected for the National Arts Council's Noise The Apprenticeship Program and was mentored by local music veteran, Kevin Mathews. The band will contribute a new song to the Noise compilation CD to be released in early 2011. 

Age of Sinfonia is driven by a vision to inspire all its listeners by touching hearts and soul with its music and is looking forward to bringing its music across Asia and beyond
