Flauros is a black metal band from Joensuu, Finland. Flauros was formed at the dawn of 1996 by Sinkkonen (bass, vocals) and Kartzu (drums) with the aim to create something own and to express their feelings through dark and aggressive music. Also a guitarist, Teemu, joined the band and after a year from the birth of the band, in august 1997, Flauros entered the studio to record their first demo entitled "The Myth...". The demo was sold out in a year for a total amount of 360 copies and this response was more than what they expected. After the first studio sessions, the band started to look for another guitarist and in december of the same year Wraith joined the horde. New songs were finished during the spring of 1998 and plans were to enter the studio again. Teemu, however, left the band for personal reasons and the research for another guitarist begun. Few weeks passed and a close friend, Nightswan, joined, filling the hole that Teemu left behind. FLAUROS entered the studio again in july 1998 and after two days the new tape was ready. The tape was named "Chapter II" and was sold out again in a year. This time 400 copies were made. After the attacks of their two demos, Flauros rose once again the sword against heaven in form of "Monuments of Total Holocaust" miniCD, produced by The Twelfth Planet Records in april 2000. The band then released "Third Curse" EP on Dark Horizon Records. After this the "Before My Eyes the New World Rose" EP was released. Flauros also released three promo tracks in 2005 which can be found at http://www.mikseri.net/artists/flauros.47958.php. Members are currently living in different parts of Finland, and there has not been any plans nor activities since the 2005 recording sessions.
