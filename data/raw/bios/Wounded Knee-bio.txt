4) Wounded Knee is an Italian prog metal band, around since 1994, but has produced only one real album so far in 1997. Heyoke is an album not dissimilar in style to GB Arts The Lake. Written from a metal perspective, it is larded with more symphonic elements due to the worked out composition and the generally melodic way the songs are treated. All centered around the theme of the oppression of Indian people ("native Americans") in the USA, the music itself also has a bit of a tribal feel to it.
