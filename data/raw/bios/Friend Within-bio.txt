Breaking through the ranks of upcoming UK house producers is "The Game" from new artist Friend Within. The man behind the new moniker is a mystery but the quality is impeccable. We tend to believe this is not the work of a new kid but rather an experienced producer who knows what he is doing. These 2 tracks were the cream of the demo pile and there's no way this guy just picked up a DAW last week. 'The Game' kicks off with a stuttering heavyweight house cut on the title track; a shuffling snare rolling instrumental that is built for peak time house parties. 'The Hollow' shows a penchant for 90s house echoed by some truly crisp and crunchy basslines that cement Friend Within as a monster producer and close friend of the dirtybird camp. But who is Friend Within? It's clear he has inimitable knowledge behind the decks, is well-versed in the classics and brings a fresh spin to experienced production. His roots may be impossible to determine but the eerie support is universal. We are just happy to be first (as usual!) to release his music. With forthcoming releases on the likes of Hypercolour and Pets Recordings in 2013, plus huge love for the forthcoming remix 'Renegade Master' that has everyone from Disclosure to Monki and B.Traits in a spin, expect to be seeing and hearing a lot more from Friend Within over the next years to come. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Friend+Within">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
