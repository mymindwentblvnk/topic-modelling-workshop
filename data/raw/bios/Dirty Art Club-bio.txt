Every now and again a new artist or group comes along that completely catches you by surprise, enter Dirty Art Club. The North Carolina duo, comprised of producers Matt Cagle & Madwreck, are currently celebrating the release of their debut album, Heavy Starch. Combining influences from various genres and drawing inspiration from a local artist, Marcus Kiser, D.A.C. have crafted one of the most influential instrumental albums to be released since the emergence of DJ Shadow and RJD2.

D.A.C.’s dark & moody production, influenced by their love for sampling, analog synths & field recording, coupled with the Kiser’s disposition towards an eclectic mix of comic art, social/political events and the hip hop culture led to the culmination of life imitating art – in the musical sense that is. Heavy Starch is an undoubtedly dark, edgy & unrelenting journey through sound. Whether your just looking for soundscapes to vibe to or backdrops to inspire writing, be sure to take this opportunity now and be one of the first to get familiar with Dirty Art Club. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dirty+Art+Club">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
