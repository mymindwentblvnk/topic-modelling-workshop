Taunus was formed by the Berliner steel string guitarists Jan Thoben and Jochen Briesen in early 2001. They were joined by Wilm Thoben and SÃ¶ren Schrader playing percussion, banjo, harmonium and vibraphone at live concerts. Guest musicians Paul Lubitz, Micha Bucur and Derek Shirley were invited to play along at the recording sessions for "Malinche", the first longplayer. Taunus' line-up keeps changing a bit and is heading towards a more flexible ensemble conception. Michael Thieke, Derek Shirley and Wilm Thoben join Taunus these days. Taunus play acoustic instrumental music. You can find elements ranging from folk, fingerpicked minimal structures to improvised and more open forms in their music.
