Orphaned by their convictions to stay true to themselves and their music, four musicians abandoned all that they knew and went in search of a place that they could call home. 

Drummer Kevin Miller relinquished his successful nine-year career with Platinum recording artist Fuel, guitarist Brian Quinn left his songs and five years of his career with Philadelphia's Octane, bassist Eric Leonhardt said goodbye to his friends and brothers of Freak and vocalist Danny Beissel traded his lucrative solo gig--all to join a band that would truly be the sum of its parts. 

Encompassing Millers steadfast back beats, Quinns gritty blues-playing, Erik James thunderous bass riffs and Beissels melodic harmonies, it seems that FOSTERCHILD has finally found its home. And it resides within good old fashioned rock n roll. 

"Coming from different bands, we all knew what we didnt want to become, but were uncertain of what direction we were headed musically, said Quinn. Our sound just sort of developed after months of writing and feeding off one anothers style and influences. If asked to describe us, Id say we were just a whiskey-drinkin' rock n roll band". 

Quinn is right. FOSTERCHILDs sound and look are reminiscent of a time when rock n roll was more about attitude than image. "Coming from our previous bands, we were just sick of trying to be something that we're not, said Miller. That's why we chose our name. Were like the bastards of rock n roll. We belong to no one but ourselves". 

So perhaps they really werent looking for themselves but rather looking for themselves within the music. And now they've finally found it with FOSTERCHILD.
