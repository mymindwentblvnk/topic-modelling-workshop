The story of Docile starts out in the fall of 2005, when three guys from the Netherlands  started searching for a way to express their emotions, energy and faith. They didn’t limit themselves to any particular style, and through nightly jam sessions, Geert, Nanne, and Michiel came up with a song entitled “Fragile Commitment”. The three would need a front man to give a face to the band, and in April 2006, after a long search, Jan Jelte was brought on as vocalist and front man for the band. It wasn’t until around October of  2006,  however, that the band started seriously buckling down and writing and rehearsing officially,  which would result in  six songs  completed between October 2006 and January 2007. Five of these songs would end up on a demo entitled “Babylon Ablaze”, which was released later in 2007.  

Among all this activity in the band’s schedule was their first live show, which would also occur in January of 2007. This would be followed up by several dates in the Ukraine, as well as numerous show dates in and around Holland. These shows were a great success, and it was due to this success that Docile entered the studio again to record two new tracks, which would see release in the form of an EP version of “Babylon Ablaze”, in November of 2007, in the European market.  

Docile features overwhelming chaos, intense melodies, heavy soloing, and a powerful chord structure. They have not backed down one bit since they started, and the band has something to offer to fans of all genres of metal. Docile will be taking over the North American market for the first time with the release of Babylon Ablaze on Open Grave Records in late spring.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Docile">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
