Blekinge, the name of the part of Sweden Signo Rojo hails from loosely translates to "Pale nothing"... That could be seen as somewhat indicative of the national character of the nation that has spawned some of the best harder-edged musical groups around these last decades. Also cheap furniture.

Signo Rojo is an entity with both fleet firmly planted. One foot is anchored in the deep sludge of southern USA and the other planted in the ethereal world of introspective post-metal. The dangly bits inbetween have, on the other hand, been dipping into a wide variety of places. Be it crust-punk, doom-metal, classic prog or hardrock, Signo Rojo's privates has had an intimate history with it.

The Band proper was formed in the late autumn of 2009, when the four members met at a local metal-show. They began writing almost immediatly and spent the following winter and spring cooked up in the rehersalroom constructing and shaping a dynamic live-set that continues to evolve to this day. The following summer they started their crusade of gathering as much live experience as possible with their hopes set high on a touring future. A hardworking band is a healthy band and Signo Rojo craves the excitement, the energy and the positive social interactions you only get at a live show.
