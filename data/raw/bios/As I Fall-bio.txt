As I fall was formed in May 2009 in Banja Luka. After 3 months of rehearsal they had their first gig. Than 2 more by the end of 2009. In February 2010 they recorded their first EP with 5 songs on it in studio Paradox in Smederevo (Serbia). As soon as Ep was put on the internet, it got great critics from audience and other artists too. Than they promoted the EP with shows in the region. In August 2010 they applied for 44th Zajecarska gitarijada, the biggest demo bands competition based festival in Ex Yugoslavia. They won the first place by the votes of jury. That brought them a lot of media attention in the region. Most of the radio, TV and news have spoken about them. Even tons of web portals. They carried on with their work than and shot their first HD music video for a new song. Due to one member leaving the band they had some problems and it all got too long. But they found new member and carried on with their work. Now in the beginning of 2012 the video is out together with a single and it's dubstep remix. Later on the whole first full length album should be out too. As I Fall also played 3. SARAJEVO METAL FEST, URBAN FEST OSIJEK with Exodus and Suicidal Angels and great EXIT FESTIVAL 2012.  T-shirts and hoodies also about to be printed by PITSOME MERCH from Zagreb, their new partner and sponsor. Stay tuned! \m/ <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/As+I+Fall">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
