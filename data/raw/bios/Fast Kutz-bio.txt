A Cleveland, County Durham based Heavy Metal band forged by former HAMMER and HOLLAND guitarist Kenny Nicholson. Both Nicholson's previous acts had recorded for the Hull based Ebony label and FAST KUTZ duly followed suit. Initially the band was fronted by Marty Clerkin although his services would be dispensed with midway through the recording process of the debut album, being cut at Ebony's Hemingborough Hall studios in North Yorkshire by producer Darryl Johnston. Auditions brought in Keith Davison to complete the job. Apparently, once FAST KUTZ had started to put down vocals they discovered Clerkin could not sing. Quickfire auditions found Davison, who put down his vocals in just two days. The 'Burnin' album featured cover artwork by Garry Sharpe-Young, also executed in just two days.

Reaction to the debut album was positive and FAST KUTZ landed a valuable Radio One session after no less a figure than a guesting OZZY OSBOURNE gave the band a ringing endorsement for the song 'Fight To Be Free'. The session, recorded at BBC's Maida Vale Studios, was generally agreed to be a far superior production job than the album.

A second album, with new faces bassist Ian McLaughlin and second guitarist Ian Gillson of ARIZONA, was recorded but its release shelved as Ebony hit financial troubles. Nicholson subsequently joined club acts BLACK MARKET and OUTRAGEOUS WALLPAPER.
