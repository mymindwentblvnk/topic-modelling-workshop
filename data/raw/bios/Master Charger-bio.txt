Master Charger formed in the summer of 2006. Hailing from Nottinghamshire, UK. Initially Master Charger began life as a three piece until 2008 when they recruited a second guitarist. Influenced by a wide range of music. Fusing 70's Rock with Punk / Metal tinges and throwing in a psychedelic twist mixed with downtuned monster grooves provides an overall raw Rock N' Roll feel. The band began to jam ideas and quickly found that they had enough material to record an album, the debut album is now completed and is entitled "Southbound N' Supercharged". Master Charger have been playing live since its release to target a whole range of audiences with their retro but yet fresh modern sound and approach to heavy music.
