Named for the super-massive class of star, Hypergiant combine stoner metal fuzz with prog-influenced heavy rock to create a sound suitably colossal to do justice to their namesake.

Drawing inspiration from a diverse range of artists, from the unholy great-granddaddies of stoner metal, Black Sabbath, to the modern behemoths such as Mastodon, The Sword and Red Fang, and with a hint of the psychedelic space-rock characteristic of Pink Floyd and Hawkwind, Hypergiant are steadily carving out a sound of their own from the molten sludge of these combined influences.

They eschew cookie-cutter breakdowns, skinny jeans and uniform hairstyles in exchange for hard-hitting, low to the ground riffs, unique song structures and an insatiable appetite for distortion.


In early 2014 the band released their self-produced debut EP, Planetcracker. Recorded and mixed at The Brain Studios by Michael Taverner and vocalist Nathan Lee, the 4-track disk is a relentless slab of earth-shaking, fuzzed out, acid-tinged heaviness.

In the wake of the EPâ€™s release, Hypergiant have been uncompromisingly assaulting the Sydney live music scene with all the precision and finesse of a sledgehammer, converting the metal masses to their cause along the way.
