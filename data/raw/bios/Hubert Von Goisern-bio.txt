Hubert von Goisern (born 17.Nov 1952 as Hubert Achleitner) is a musician from Austria.
Alongside Attwenger he is considered as one of the most influential heads of the "Neue Volksmusik" (lit. "New Folklore Music") movement.
He became famous as Hubert von Goisern und die Alpinkatzen.

After this very successful setup split by the end of 1994,
HvG produced two world music CD with musicians from Tibet and Africa.

In 2000 he made his comeback with a new band and the album "foen".
The studio album "iwasig" was recorded after the tour and released 2002.

A personal project first, but due to the big success of the first "Trad" CD,
soon "Trad II" followed. Both feature original austrian folk songs.

The latest and biggest project is the "Linz Europe Tour 2007-2009".
Travelling on an adapted cargoship, fully equipped with a stage,
the journey went east first and then will head west.
