Lagerstein are a folking, drinking, shouting and pirating rock/metal outfit hailing from the distant shores of Brisbane, Australia. Their debut album "Drink 'Til We Die" is loaded with 12 fun filled tracks of loud guitars, soaring keytars, earworm melodies and adventurous tales that will have you singing drunken sea shanties for drinks and drinks.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lagerstein">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
