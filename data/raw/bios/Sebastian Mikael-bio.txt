Born in Sweden to a Swedish father and Ethiopian mother, Sebastian Mikael grew up in a diverse household immersed in music, fashion and art. In 2008, he moved from Sweden to Los Angeles to attend the Musicians Institute before continuing his studies at Boston's prestigious Berklee College of Music. While a student at Berklee, he was signed by Slip-N-Slide Records CEO Ted Lucas and in late 2011 he released his first mixtape, J'Adore, which received rave reviews from his steadily growing fan base. Months later, his homegrown "Beautiful Life" YouTube video caught the ear of renowned industry executive Sylvia Rhone, who swiftly partnered with Slip-N-Slide to sign him to Vested in Culture, her label with Epic Records. The classically trained 24-year-old singer-songwriter-musician is currently putting the finishing touches on his forthcoming debut album, working with an A-list roster of songwriters and producers, including Jim Jonsin and Rico Love. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sebastian+Mikael">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
