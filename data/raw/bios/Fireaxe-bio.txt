Fireaxe is a one-man musical project founded in 1995 and based in Chula Vista, California. Driven by a vision to produce metal music that invigorates the mind as well as the body, Fireaxe creator, Brian Voth, has slaved away behind an overburdened Mac G3 and a tall stack of gear for years crafting a hard driving yet elegant sound which matches his provocative religious and political themes. Brian sings the lead and backup vocals, plays lead, rhythm, and bass guitars, does all the keyboards and programs the drum machine as well, but despite all of the limitations of working solo in a home studio the final product jumps off of the CD with a force and fury that continues to impress, and sometimes overwhelm, a small but growing contingent of Fireaxe supporters. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fireaxe">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
