There are two bands named Supershine:

1) Supershine is a heavy metal band from the USA. It was a side project with Doug Pinnick of King's X and Bruce Franklin of Trouble.  Jerry Gaskill of King's X was the featured drummer.  Jeff Oly Olson, also of Trouble, was a guest drummer for two tracks and was a pre production Engineer. Their only release is the self titled album from 2000.


2) Supershine is a danish band playing new wave/indie/rock music with a clear inspiration from the old traditional rock music. The members of the band are Kristoffer Blom: vocal and guitar, Christoffer Iuel: guitar, Simon McNair: bass and Mathias Sarsgaard: drums.

Even though the four guys are only 18-19 years old, they have received a lot of positive comments and are now a respected band in the danish underground. After only one month of playing with each other they had recorded four songs in their own studio.
