Expulser was a black/death/thrash metal band from Brazil formed in 1989. They released two demos in 1989 and 1990 and a split with fellow Brazilian death/thrashers Brutal Distortion in 1990. Their first album, The Unholy One was released in 1993 on Cogumelo Records (a label well known for releasing the "Warfare Noise" death/thrash compilations and early albums from several death/thrash bands). The band disappeared for most of the 90s, returning in 1999 with a demo, followed by another demo in 2003 and their final album "Haeresis" in 2006. The band split-up afterward when frontman Weber Dahemon converted to Christianity, abandoning the blasphemous themes of his band and forbidding the remaining members to continue using the name Expulser. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Expulser">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
