Klaus Layer, sometimes known as Captain Crook, was always interested in eastern German art and music, but it was the fall of the Berlin Wall that truly opened up new opportunities for him to explore a wider range of art and foreign cultures.  Klaus was born in Oranienburg, Germany, and while his preference for 90′s hip-hop music and the influence of a local graffiti scene can be seen and heard in his work, he has his own distinct identity as a creator.  Klaus cites artists like Michael Hamel, Günther Fischer, Can, Pete Rock, Damu the Fudgemunk and Lord Finesse as sources of inspiration, just as much as he does the Surrealist style of art as well as the audio & visuals found in old movies from the 50s-70s.  All of Layer’s different influences, along with some non-traditional sampling resources have somehow been morphed together via his instrument of choice, a sampler, into a unique style of instrumental music full of rich layers, including all sorts of percussive and melodic patterns.
