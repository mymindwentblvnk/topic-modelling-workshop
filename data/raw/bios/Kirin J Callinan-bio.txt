Kirin J Callinan is an apex predator. A butterfly. A grassfire. A beautiful baby boy wandered curiously into trouble. You're listening to something very specific when you're hearing Kirin J express himself. And you're right to be wondering if this mania, this insanity, this total abandon exists within all of us. Makes you wonder if you've just missed out. If you're a coward for never trying. If you were ever on the field in the first place. Out there is a pendulum that swings recklessly between madness and precision.
