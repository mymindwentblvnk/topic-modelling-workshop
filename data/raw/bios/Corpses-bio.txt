A Negative Hardcore band from Glasgow, Scotland.

Born of four veteran characters of the punk and metal scene in Glasgow, they are a self-described
Progressive Hardcore band with crust influences. Citing the likes of Trap Them, Cancer Bats, Converge and Cursed as influences, they write songs about self destruction, drugs and betrayal.

 Their debut DIY E.P. 'Half Elvis is a handmade diatribe against music. A potent brand of negative hardcore that leaves you unsure if you've just been spiked, seduced or beaten up.

 Having played select gigs since forming in May 2008 they have shared the stage with Take A Worm For A Walk Week, Kylesa, Carpathian, Ceremony, Paint it Black, Charger, Ding Dong Dead, Butros Bubba, Hey Enemy, More Than A Joke and Hey Vampires.
