Skelethal is a Death metal band from Lille, France. Skelethal was born in early 2012, when Gui Haunting and Jon Whiplash decided to vomit some Death Metal. Tuning down their instruments, they recorded a demo called "Morbid ovation" in summer 2012. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Skelethal">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
