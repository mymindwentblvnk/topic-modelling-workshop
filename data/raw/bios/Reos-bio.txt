Reos was born in the city of Vigo (Spain) in 2003. The same year they open for the great spanish band Ob√∫s, and record their first demo which has a heavy metal sound and a lot of energy. This demo allows them to play at a great number of stages in the province of Galicia.

After some changes, the band begins to mature, paying attention to new and different music genres in metal and rock in general. With a more solid sound, they begin to prepare their new album without stopping playing, and opening for some well known bands. So this is how 113 is born, a whole proof of metal, consolidating a band that already has built itself a name and the respect in their hometown.
