1)Drawing on a diverse set of talent, the Deadly Sins emerge as a fresh voice in the long-standing Boston punk rock scene. The band’s formation at the start of 2006, marks the fusion of a group with already established roots in the music world. The group was founded by lead vocalist Stephanie Dougherty and guitarist Billy Brown.

Stephanie, known for her work with the Dropkick Murphy’s, has recorded with artists such as Roger Miret & the Distasters, the Lost City Angels, and also appeared on the Dropkicks hit single "the Dirty Glass". She has been touring with the Dropkicks since 2002, appearing on live television and stages all across the world.

In 2005, Stephanie and Billy began working together on the Deadly Sins, where Billy leads on guitar and splits some of the vocal duties with Stephanie. Billy formed the punk rock and roll band Crash and Burn in the late 90’s, releasing three full-length records and touring extensively. After calling it quits in 2005, Bill brought along fellow Crash and Burn bandmate Joe Packard to the Deadly Sins on bass.

Brendan, on guitar, is most known for his involvement in the Boston hardcore band Reach the Sky who, after two full-length records and six years of touring the world, decided to retire in 2003. After four years behind the scenes, he decided it was time to take another stab at band life, joining the Deadly Sins with long time friend Stephanie.

Nathan Bice, on drums, has spent most of the past few years touring throughout the US and Europe for the Chicago-based band, Even In Blackouts, as well as making appearances as a studio engineer and drummer for bands like The Queers and The Generics.
