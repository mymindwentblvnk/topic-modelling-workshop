GIBORALTAR are dwelling in atemporal rhythms and moods of music; the fundamental expression of the inner path and horizon that have born and speak in our hearts, a pulse that through time, will be an awakening of the essence, true torch of our solar origin, a manifestation of the eternal indo-european spirituallity. A call and rite awakened, guided by the memory of cristalline stellar bloodâ€¦ for that this is a gathering of swords, with flaming suns in the hands. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Giboraltar">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
