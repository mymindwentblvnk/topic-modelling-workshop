There are multiple artists with this name:

1) Grotesque was a Swedish death/black metal band formed in Gothenburg, Sweden  in September 1988 from the remains of Conquest by Kristian WÃ¥hlin (Necrolord) and Per Nordgren (Virgintaker) with the addition of Tomas "Tompa" Lindberg (Goatspell). The band was however short-lived and recorded a few demos and an EP. After the demise of the band Lindberg and Svensson started At the Gates, while Necrolord created his own band Liers in Wait and focused more on creating artwork for several bands including Dissection and Emperor. In 1996, three members, Goatspell, Necrolord, and Offensor got back together and recorded two songs for the release of a compilation album, which was later re-released as a split album with At the Gates EP Gardens of Grief.

Grotesque briefly reformed in 2007 for a single invite-only concert on January 26 in Stockholm, to celebrate the publication of Daniel Ekeroth's book Swedish Death Metal. Nirvana 2002 and Interment also reunited for the concert.

With a ferocious live performance and sound, it is easy to see why this band has become one of Australia's finest.

Grotesque was formed in 2004 by Marc Hawkins (Guitarist) with the intention to create brutal and original death metal.

A replacement was not far away with Daniel Coombs stepping in to take the front man role.

Since their time in the Australian metal scene they have supported such bands as Cannibal Corpse, Nile, Suffocation, Dismember, Psycroptic, Decapitated, Obituary, Fuck I'm Dead, The Berzerker, Alarum, Contrive, The Amenta, Carcass, Fleshgore, Akercocke, Blood Duster, Metalstock in Sydney, An Australian tour with Kataklysm and a various line up of killer local bands.
