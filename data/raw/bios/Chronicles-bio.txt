1) Project of Mark Gregory and John Heitman, from Norway. 
2) Death metal band from Bangladesh


1) Its with pleasure we introduce you to Chronicles.
A project which has taken some time to come to fruition, with this album as the result.

A new musical introduction to the English singer, guitarist & songwriter Mark Gregory.
Originally from Somerset, England. Before he settled in Trondheim he lived and played for the many years in the west of Ireland where he played a great deal of traditional music on the fiddle and was also a member of several Irish bands.

We are reintroduced to John Heitman. A well known artist from the mid-norwegian music scene. He played for many years with different bands but is still best remembered from his time as the lead singer of Baby-Baby.

"We beleive our music is accessible to a wide age-group of listeners. We hope so, says John Heitman,"
who is looking forward to gigs and related work with the band in the future.
"The music helps keep us up and on track, says Mark."
The two of them seem to have found enjoyment and inspiration in each others music which may be found through listening to these songs.

Beautiful tunes with maybe a touch of melancholia here and there, allied to well observed lyrics.
Chronicles have made an album with depth and presence which creates a calm but soulful rock atmosphere.
Their songs were contributed to, in sound and voice by the talents of:

-Siri Gjære & Marte Valle, backing-vocal
-Håkon Gebhart(ex-Motorpsycho, HGH) banjo
-Sveinung Lillebjerka, Bodø sinfonitta and Tango Concertino
