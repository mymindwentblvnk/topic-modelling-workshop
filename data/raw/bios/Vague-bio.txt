2.) Vague is a metal band from Oulu, Finland. Vague was formed in 2009 by Ville Karinkanta (guitar), Lari Haataja (guitar and vocals), Jimi Välikangas (bass), and Miika Kilponen (drums). At the end of 2010, Vague hired a new drummer called Valtteri Honka and later on a new bass player, Matias Ärrälä. Unfortunately, it didn't last long and Matias Ärrälä left the band for other projects.
Vague originally played thrash-metal but along the way the genre changed to heavy metal. First demo of Vague called Dirty Mirror came out in 2010. The first EP, which carries the same name, is coming out fall 2011. The two songs of the original "Dirty Mirror" have been re-recorded for this EP, and a couple of new tracks will also finally be available.
