Chastisement was a melodic death metal band from Östersund, Sweden.

Marcus Edvardsson and Fredrik Magnusson began playing seriously in 1995 when the formed Chastisement.  Fredrik was told of drummer Nils Fjellstrom, whom he promptly contacted.  After a few lineup changes, and the resignation of Fredrik, the lineup has remained stable. 

Johan Klitkou - Vocals
Tommy Larsson - Guitar
Marcus Edvardsson - Guitar
Nicklas Linnes - Bass guitar
Nils Fjellström - Drums

Chastisement recorded and released a demo-tape in 1997 which helped them gather many local fans.  But it wasn’t until their first CD ..But We Are Lost recorded in 1999, where their fan base grew.

Chastisement received massive and almost overwhelming
positive responses from their fans and the press.  Labels tempted the band with contracts, however they chose against it.
 
In the summer of 2001, the band decided to take a break
from shows and rehearsal.  They entered the TLS AB studio to record their newest full-length CD named Alleviation of Pain which was released on October 11, 2002.

Not long after, Nicklas Linnes left the band (sometime around 2004/05). Shortly after that, Chastisement was put on hold and the members focused on other projects. As of July 25th, 2008, the band is still on hold if not broken up completely. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Chastisement">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
