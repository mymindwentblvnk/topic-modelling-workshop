Zombie Raiders started in early '09 as a goregrind band with heavily pitch-shifted vocals but not long after that the band changed their style to old school grindcore. Dropping the pitchshifter and recruiting a new guitarist/bassist. They now play a more DIY, old school type of grindcore with all the lyrics based on old horror movies. After going through many members the band has a solid line-up consisting of founding member Ian (drums, backing vocals) and SLK (guitars, bass, lead vocals).
