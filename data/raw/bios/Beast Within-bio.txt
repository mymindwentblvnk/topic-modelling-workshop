Beast Within from Quebec, Canada proudly wears its musical influences on its sleeves, taking cues from bands such as early Celtic Frost and Pentagram. Lyrically, the band stands for the emanation of the true "Self", buried deep inside each man and woman by centuries of decadence, slavery and blindness imposed by a false moral, political and religious elite.
