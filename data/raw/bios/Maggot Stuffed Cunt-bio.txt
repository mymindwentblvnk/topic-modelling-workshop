Maggot Stuffed Cunt (abbreviated MSC) were a technical death metal/grindcore/deathcore band located in Reading, UK. They utilize various vocal techniques ranging from low end death growls reminiscent of 'Beneath The Massacre' to high pitched "pig squeals", usually in the same song. The drums section consists of blast beats and other fast paced patterns, while the bass pummels the listener with low and crushing riffs and lines. The guitar part ranges from technical verses and solos to simplistic and devastatingly brutal breakdowns.

The band has a few recorded songs and a debut EP is due out between late 2008 to early 2009 (but wasn't released). Recently, the band had a feud during the making of their EP and sadly but surely fell apart.  What once was a rising greatness, now just a hidden memory.
