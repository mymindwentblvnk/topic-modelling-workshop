Joshua Hamilton also known as his stage name "Lil Darkie" is a rapper, producer and artist from Long Beach, California.

Lil Darkie’s music is most noticeable due to his “cartoonish” personality both in his music and on social media, such as speaking in all caps and being over-the-top. He also takes hip-hop and fuses it with rock, noise, country and other genres of music.

Darkie is also known for his artwork, which he draws himself and offers other musicians artwork. Much like his personality, his artwork is cartoony, and contains over-the-top imagery and allusions to drugs, poverty, violence, racism, and other normally taboo subjects. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lil+Darkie">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
