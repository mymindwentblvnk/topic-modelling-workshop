It all began in late 2013 when Robin went on a search for a new band to join after the "disband" of Blasphemus. In his search he found an ad with a band looking for a bass player for a melodic death metal band.
Robin's first reaction after he'd listen to the sample that was given was - "The singer sounds like Jon Nödveit! This could be really fun!".
The singer in this band was David and with just one guitarist.
Robin contacted David and stated his interest in joining the band. A few weeks passed without even meeting up or finding any additional band member. Then one day Robin suggested to David that he knew a guitarist that could join us, Ludvig. David were interested and Robin contacted Ludvig.
After some discussion Robin and Ludvig came up with the idea to form a new band with David as a singer and their mutual friend Anton. Said and done, Casus Belli was born!

Although the band wasn't complete without a drummer and a search for one began.
Not the easiest task in the world, drummers seem to be the hardest ones to find.
Then one day Germán came along, though only as a session since he's already a member in three bands since before.
But the creation of music started for real!

After a while we all agreed upon changing the name of the band since there already were a few bands and artist that were called Casus Belli, we didn't really care for it anyway.
After a few weeks of discussion back and forth with name suggestions we came up with the name Helvegen. We got it from a band called Wardruna, which we're big fans of, that had that as a song title.
Helvegen can be translated from norwegian to "The path to hell".  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Helvegen">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
