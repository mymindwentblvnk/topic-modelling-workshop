The project known as Lhind has grown stronger and stronger during the autumn of 2006. The person behind the name is a young man from Sweden, north of Stockholm to be more precise. His first song to be released to radio is "Varlden Utanfor" (eng. "The World Outside"). It's a great song with a strong hook and the story in the song is about a secret relationship that overcomes everything.

The story behind the name Lhind is actually quite funny. The guy who created the logo has dyslexia and didn't see that he wrote the last name of the artist wrong (the right spelling is Lindh). But the artist liked the look of the name and kept it.
