Guillaume Dietrich a.k.a Muddy Monk was born 28 years ago in Switzerland, in the canton of Fribourg. His music-loving and amateur singers parents enrolled him in the local choir before suggesting he learned the piano. Although right from the start, he preferred improvising and experimenting rather than learning and executing. From those years, he keeps a young soul and an angelic high-pitched voice, inherited from the Christian vocal traditions of Fribourg.

Even though he began his artistic career as a producer and featured on the hit song “Le Code” in 2017 with Ichon, Myth Syzer and Bonnie Banane, Muddy Monk’s work today is less hip-hop based and more a varied form of synthetic and romantic pop music, sung in French. His first album Longue Ride is a collection of songs about adventure, love, violence and the quest of a good life, all themes that refer to the young man‘s anxieties and his yearning to overcome them. A variety of topics that he approaches with a mechanic and desperate lyricism often similar to another powerful-motorcycle aficionado whose label was even named Les Disques Motors: we are referring to the legendary Christophe. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Muddy+Monk">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
