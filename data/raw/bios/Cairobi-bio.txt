Cairobi (formerly called Vadoinmessico) are a five-piece band from several corners of the Earth residing in London and playing beautiful, nostalgic psychedelic folk-pop. Giorgio (from Italy), Salvador (from Mexico) started the band and were soon joined by banjo player Stefan (from Austria) and Alessandro (also Italian), and their English drummer Joe. They have recorded their debut album, with the help of mix engineer Craig Silvey (Arcade Fire, Portishead, etc) and are now ready to enchant the world with their exceptional sounds.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cairobi">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
