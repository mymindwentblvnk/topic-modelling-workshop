Formed in 1996, Sterkvind were a portuguese black metal band! Their lyrics were mainly related with paganism, anti-christianity and the self-destructive nature of Humanity. Historical references were used to document and exploit that  dark human instinct for self destruction, never with a political angle. The line-up was composed by two members: Ogham (vocals and lyrical concept) and Morfolk (guitar, bass and musical concept). During their existence as a band they recorded one demo entitled "Agrat-Bat-Mahlat" (2001) and featured in two splits "Burning The False Idol" (2002) and "Kult of the Black Flame" (2003). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sterkvind">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
