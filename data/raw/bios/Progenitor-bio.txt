There are two bands named Progenitor

The duo from Greece Progenitor (Marios Seraidaris & Nick Karamalakis) first met in 2003 when they both made their first steps in electronic music production. One year later they decided to make their first track together. The result of that encouraged them to create a progressive trance project under the name Progenitor. Their different hearings in electronic music were combined into one and resulted a melodic groovy atmospheric style. The first Progenitor tracks had great response and caused the intrest of some well known labels like Iono,Blue Tunes, Yellow Sunshine explosion, Plusquam etc. After some releases in various compilations they agreed with Iono music (Germany) to create their debut album witch is still in progress and will be released in September 09 so stay tuned..!
