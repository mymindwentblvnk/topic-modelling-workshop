Parasitic Extirpation began its existence in the fall of 2007 shortly after the disintegration of New England death metal outfit Porphyria. Blue Spinazola (Guitar, also of Dysentery/Sexcrement) and Tim Murphy (Vocals) were left to press on and continue brutalizing, and they did by quickly recruiting ex-The Taste of Silver drummer Alex Carrara to solidify a concrete foundation. The group then integrated Drew Copeland-Will of Proteus/Dysentery into the low end pocket and Chris Kessaris (3 Headed Monster) into lead guitar position. The end result is a precise and tightly woven fusion of technical death metal & guttural, groove-laden insanity.

The band entered 2008 with the release of the 'Knee Deep in Disease' EP and with it they have garnered great responses in reviews worldwide and hammering eardrums live. Playing shows throughout the Northeast alongside heavyweights such as Cephalic Carnage, Skinless, Dying Fetus, Misery Index, Rotten Sound, Origin, Circle of Dead Children and more, the band has quickly made their presence known in the underground.

Parasitic Extirpation released their first full-length, Casketless, on June 3rd, 2010.
