Maxsta may seem like just any other grime musician, but excellent is an understatement for this young and gifted 16 year old. Living in E6, East ham & attending the school of Langdon, it's very difficult to become as rated as Maxsta is, it's not easy to get to the place he is at now. Maxsta used to be in a small group of musicians in his year at high school but they didn't seem serious about the music business, so he decided to go solo, until he joined Mucky Wolfpack, he then has been lucky to have the chance to make music with big grime scene stars such as, Wiley, Bless Beats & Little Dee. Maxsta also visited a recording studio called "Always Recording" in North London and was introduced to Double S, Chipmunk, & Frisco and made further songs with Dot Rotten & Stylo G at digital holdings in South London. He also visited a studio called "Cable Studios" which is the home to Roll Deep, Lewi White, & EskiBeat. He is currently unsigned but has been granted a distribution deal for his upcoming mixtapes called "Still Learning Vol.1" Maxsta is still making progress towards his music career and alot more is yet to be heard.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Maxsta">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
