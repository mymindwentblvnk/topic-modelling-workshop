3.)  Back in the mid-14th century, Beak was willed into existence by a four-headed green dragon named Ricardo II the Powerful.  The dragon was immediately pleased with his manifestation and began teaching the entity how to play guitar.  The guitar is an extremely rare 14-string 8th century Mendosa Nomad model, boasting a 4 foot long fretboard equipped with strings woven from over 3000 bald eagle eggs.  Beak immediately learned to wail savagely on the guitar, but to this day is no match to his master Ricardo II.  This is why Beak invented the computer back in the 1850s; he desparately needed processing technology capable of doing his 14 string Mendosa Nomad appropriate justice and thereby surpassing the abilities of his virtuoso dragon mentor.  Aided by the magic of digital computing, Beak records his unique guitar stylings into discrete packets of 0s and 1s, layers them on top of each other in the most advanced of all electronic editing software, Goldwave, and releases the songs free to the public in the most generous display of altruism ever witnessed by human beings. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Beak">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
