Coming from the South of France, Adam a.k.a Habstrakt was a guitar and keys player before turning his mind onto samplers and grooveboxes very early. He first got into Trip Hop and also wrote music for movies & even theater, but in 2008 he discovered dubstep and drum n bass music, and immediately got involved in production and DJ'ing.

Four years later his tracks are welcomed by many established labels such as Buygore and Never Say Die. Those releases have gained him huge support from some of the biggest names in the the scene such as Flux Pavilion, Borgore & Datsik amongst others. It's been two years now since he began touring as a DJ throughout Europe, always smashing the dancefloor with a tight, precise yet energetic mix. So far nothing seems to stop him 2012 as he's now among those to follow closely.

He did some stuff after 2012 as well which is pretty cool I guess. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Habstrakt">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
