The Black Cat Orchestra has been performing in Seattle and around the West Coast since 1991. They play songs from Eastern Europe, the Mediterranean, Latin America and Asia, as well as original work. The band's unusual instrumentation - cello, accordion, saxophone, French horn, double bass, guitar, voice and drums - accounts in part for its singular, dreamy sound.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Black+Cat+Orchestra">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
