Mudpusher is a metalband from Stockholm, Sweden. The band was founded in early 2008 and has so far recorded one four track demo. Our sound can be described as a mix between Fear Factory, Otep, Chimaira and some influences from the likes of Meshuggah. We're aiming to play downtuned, heavy, fast and raw metal with focus on rhythm. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mudpusher">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
