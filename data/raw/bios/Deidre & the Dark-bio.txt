Deidre & the Dark is a cinematic, technicolor world of music conceived by Brooklyn-based songwriter, vocalist & instrumentalist Deidre Muro. Seamlessly blending her love of 60s-era pop, rock, and standards with current electronic production, her fun and soulful tracks dance that magical line between feeling utterly classic and totally fresh. After years as a side project, 2019 sees Deidre & the Dark strut to the foreground with the debut album Variety Hour - a record of  “nostalgic noir-pop enhanced by modern stereophonics” (Culture Collide), featuring recent singles “Bad Day,” “Back In Time” and “One Night” - “...a bold and brassy declaration of love for the 60s girl groups, 70s Philly soul, and modern R&B that delivers the kinds of hooks and euphoria found only in the very best pop records.” (WFMU, Sheila B)
