Decomposition Living began his training in 2011 with Nelson Urdaneta on drums and Ismael Granados on lead guitar, writing material from a higher level to their previous projects and managing new expectations in musical composition and performance. Then after months of testing with some colleagues from the local scene and search session musicians the band decided to re form the formation of Evola old death metal band now defunct, recruiting Gerson Roman on bass and vocals Carlos Lopez in completing the spaces that the band needed to achieve the desired musical weight. The band is currently finishing the recording of their EP that will be available in late 2012 with the participation of Edgar Bravo responsible for writing and recording the maximum gutturales in full. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Living+Decomposition">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
