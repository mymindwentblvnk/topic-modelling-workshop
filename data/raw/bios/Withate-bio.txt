The witHate band was born in the first months of 2006 from the Dan (drums) and Steph (vocals) minds. Soon the band was completed with the guitars of Emilio and Andy and with Emanuel on bass guitar. After they have been active in several bands of the Italian underground scene (with others Subliminal Crusher, Stick It Out, Rainspawn, Enemynside, Outbreak, Chosen and Birkenau) they unite their forces in a new project influenced by the new metalcore (Lamb of God - HateSphere) scene as well by the classic southern trhash metal school (Pantera - Testament - Slayer).
In Summer '06 they released their first demo cd (recorded and mixed in few days in their garage), just to be able to bring on stage their music as soon as possible. In April ’07 they enter at Elliott Garage Studios in Rome to release the Promo ‘Getting’to the deadline’ as a preview of the full length album.
Actually, after Trip (from Stick It Out) has replace Emanuel on bass, they're playing several gigs across Italy, playing with act like Andralls (Brazil), Achilles Last Stand (Sweden), italian Subliminal Crushers and The Orange Man Theory among others, and they have just released the debut album ‘Billion Dollar Mouth’ (recorded at the Elliott Garage Studios, Rome in July 2008), 9 tracks of pure modern thrash metal with southern influences. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/witHate">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
