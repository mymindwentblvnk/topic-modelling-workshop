Primalfrost is a Power / Black Metal band formed in early 2012. Hailing out of Toronto, Canada, the idea behind this band was to blend elements of folk metal, black metal, and melodic death metal, into epic proportions! The EP "Chapters of Time" was released in September of 2012, and the follow up in the form of the full-length album "Prosperous Visions" was released on February 10th, 2014. It is primarily the solo project of mainman Dean Arnold, but in 2012 a full line-up for live performances was formed.
