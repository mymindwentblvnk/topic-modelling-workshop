Primal Rage is a French Metal band formed in 1988 and which stopped 10 years later. 20 years after the end, we decided to wake up the beast to start a new history... Primal Rage played with bands such as Execution and Loudblast. The decision to write an album, making a vid√©o and everything that is done these days has been taken, the rest is still to write but keep an eye and an ear open.

Primal Rage influences are Slayer, Sepultura, Hatebreed, Machine Head, Metallica and all we forget...

"Freedom Is a Lie" is the Official single of the forthcoming album No Cure For Hate (Release in 2019). Mixed & Masterised at Tower Studio (Fr). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Primal+Rage">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
