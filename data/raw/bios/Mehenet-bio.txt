MEHENET connects a powerful fury of black metal mastery to the deeply rooted sounds of New Orleans - by way of utilizing samples of the bustling French Quarter and by paying respect and praise to the cultural music of the city by incorporating congas, whistles, and bells. The band captures the intricately woven frenzy of the outfits stunning musicality while interlacing their powerfully provoked hymns with screeches of vicious and commanding vocals, anxiety-inducing swarms of massive riffs, and momentous, hellish drumming. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mehenet">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
