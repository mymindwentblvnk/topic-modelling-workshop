Sleep Party People is the brainchild of Brian Batz, a Danish multi-instrumentalist with a boundless imagination. 

Taking as inspiration the work of Boards Of Canada, David Lynch and Erik Satie, Batz found the sound of the old battered piano in his apartment, coupled with a freaky electronic alteration of his recorded voice, created an eerie, hypnotic sound. 

With his other worldly signature sound in place, this one-man home recording project started to take shape back in 2008, the collection of weird and haunting melodies he created forming the basis for Sleep Party People’s self-titled debut album (2010). 

Back home in Denmark electronic pioneer Trentemøller showed his approval by offering SPP a slot on his sold out tour - followed by The Antlers and Efterklang pledging allegiance asking SPP to join them as support on their Scandinavian outings. Appearances at Roskilde Festival, By:larm and Eurosonic along with an extensive European tour and a Youtube live-video that clocked up over 1.100.000 views further cemented Sleep Party People’s burgeoning reputation. 

The overall atmosphere he fashioned, one that evokes the disorientating world between being asleep and awake, wasn’t a conscious effort. “I’ve always been a huge fan of instrumental ambient music, but I never felt that I should throw myself into making such music, but when I started the process I really got the taste of it and began to love the blend between the organic and digital world.” 

The first taste from the second album “We Were Drifting On A Sad Song” (2012), A Dark God Heart, comes accompanied by an evocative video capturing the unsettling mood Sleep Party People so effortlessly create. The album received stunning reviews and got a lot of well-deserved attention. 

“As a sonic architect, Batz proves to be something close to a Genius ... Wonderful” 
The Sunday Times 

“An intelligent, delicate, crisp yet hazy and tentatively emotional record” 
Fake DIY 

After the release of the second album SPP toured Europe several times and played their first Asian tour too. With an evolving fan-base all around the world, Brian Batz traveled to San Francisco early 2013 to work on the third and forthcoming album. This time was different because he actually had two producers working and creating the third album with him. Using a month in San Francisco in the company of producer Jeff Saltzman (The Killers, Morrisey & Blondie) and Mikael Johnston (The Sounds, Jane's Addiction), Batz achieved to record and write everything there and returned to Denmark with a nearly finished album. 

The 3rd album "Floating" is out may 30th 2014 in Scandinavia and june 2nd 2014 in Europe/Asia.
