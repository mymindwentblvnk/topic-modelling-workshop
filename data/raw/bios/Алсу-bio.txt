Russian pop singer Алсу (Alsou) shot to national stardom at the age of 15, thanks to a hit-filled debut album and a Lolita-themed video for the ballad "Zimniy Son" ("Winter Dream"). Born in 1983 in Tatarstan, her father is a politician and former oil executive; in 2004 he was named as one of the country's 100 richest men. This family background afforded her the possibility to study in the UK from a young age. She records both in Russian and English (and occasionally Tatar), and has sung duets with both Enrique Iglesias and Nelly. She married in 2006.
