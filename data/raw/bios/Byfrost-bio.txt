Byfrost summoned in forrests of the 7 mountains of Bergen, a stormy night in 2007. The first to arise from the mist was HeavyHarms and RIPmeister. Their task was simple, create massive metal and give it to the masses.
The first Ep ....byfrostmetal(2008)....was recorded with MetalMagnum on bass and HellShells on the drums. It recieved great reviews, and inspired to more great metal. They had to let both MetalMagnum and HellShells go, and hired Alkolust on the drums in 2008. HeavyHarms, R.I.Pmeister and Alkolust marches on as a trio.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Byfrost">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
