Desecrated Dreams are a melodic death metal band from Liptovsky Mikulas, Slovakia. Formed in early 1996 as a trio of Miso Patz (drums), Stano Konecny (vocals) and Milan "Jozzo" Jozefek (guitar). In summer of the same year they play first shows while fourth member - Lubo "Michi" Michalovic - joins in. In this line-up they recorded two demos - Waiting for the last sunset (1996, 7 songs, 25:45) and Raven Forest (1997, 6 songs, 23:16). With quite positive reviews they record a CD Feelings Of Guilt which is released on Metal Age Productions label (2001, 11 songs, 45:52 + multimedia). At the same time line-up is changing once again - Marek Navratil joins in to play bass and Andrej Simon replaces Miso Patz while Stano Konecny leaves the band. 
In 2004 after another line-up change (Stano Konecny - vocals, Jozzo - guitar & bass, Michi - guitar and Petrusche - keys) the band records album Die!mensions which is never officialy released. With new sound and song structures it is no longer a melodeath. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Desecrated+Dreams">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
