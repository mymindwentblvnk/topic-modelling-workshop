Birdflesh started in 1992 as grind-mince-core band similar to Ass√ºck or Magrudergrind, but quickly took another influences both about lyrics (also gore, humor, etc.) and musically (crust, punk, death metal, thrash metal, etc.). The band has recorded at date twelve albums, eight ep's and some splits next to: Agathocles, Carcass Grinder, The Kill or Catheter. In September 1999 Birdflesh went on a Japan tour. Five shows were done. After the tour, Mutanga left the band. Moshbastard replaced him and released the "Alive autopsy" LP in 2001 with no label. Founding member Magnus Roos quit the band after moving to Stockholm and joined pop/rock band Melody Club after the release of Alive Autopsy.
