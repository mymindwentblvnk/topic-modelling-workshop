Meet Slayter – everybody’s tour guide to the underworld of New York City. Born in Puerto Rico and raised in Dyckman, Slayter is a solo artist here to share a bit of dark and sinister surrealism via his lifestyle and soundscapes with us. His music is a reflection of classic New York rap, revamped through the lens of his modern day experiences and coupled with sheer honesty over lush, moody production. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Slayter">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
