Feiertag is the alter ego of Dutch drummer and producer Joris Feiertag. Recording and performing since 2014, his sound can be described as electronic yet warm, and with a preference for innovative syncopated rhythms, poppy melodies and a good vocal if he finds one.
Speaking of which: mid 2015 he breaks into Dutch national radio for the first time with his single ‘Damn You’ - featuring the guest vocals of David Dam. Released on Mike Mago’s acclaimed BMKLTSCH label, it receives international radio and club support from renowned artists and tastemakers such as Pete Tong and The Magician as well.

At the end of 2015 Feiertag releases his debut EP ‘High Expectations’ on Kraak & Smaak’s label ‘Boogie Angst’ and his second full EP, ’The Rituals’, is released in May 2016. From the latter, ’The Parachute’ is premiered on Delicieuse Musique, one of thé international music blogs.

Riding the waves of his first releases, Feiertag also lands his first major live gigs in 2015, with one of Holland’s finest electronic festivals, Pitch, in Summer, and in Fall the Amsterdam Dance Event. His live set up, visually entertaining as well, reflects his background as a drum and percussion wizard while showcasing his love for electronic sounds. Dynamic as his music is, his performances still have a lot of pace, and more than often he brings along vocalists as the icing on the live cake. Moreover, Feiertag's live reputation has recently been catching even more heat due to a successful EP presentation at legendary Amsterdam pop temple Paradiso, where, for the first time, his live act featured a permanent second band member. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Feiertag">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
