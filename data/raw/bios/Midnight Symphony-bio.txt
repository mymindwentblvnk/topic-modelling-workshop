MIDNIGHT SYMPHONY was founded in early 2004 by the former rhythm section of the german traditional metal formation FORSAKEN (KNIGHTS) and later joined by the classical singer Johanna Mott (also appearing on MAJESTY´s Hellforces album and DAWNRIDER Part 1), whose opera voice became an ideal completion to guitarist Phil Tempel´s extraordinary compositions.

But MIDNIGHT SYMPHONY is not just another melodic metal group with female vocals, it is the perfect combination of a powerful, mindblowing heavy metal group and the bombast of symphonic orchestration, as well as the beauty and intensity of a female opera voice. As you may say, it is the best of both worlds, modern heavy metal and pretentious classical music.
So in less than two years, MIDNIGHT SYMPHONY created their own, unique style of making music, a case, that is not found too often in today´s music scene.
