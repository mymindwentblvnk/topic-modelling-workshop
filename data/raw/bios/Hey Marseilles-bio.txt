Hey Marseilles is a musical group from Seattle, WA, that formed in the summer of 2006 after Nick and Philip forced Matt Bishop to write a song to an accordion riff and play it live for a work party downtown. The current lineup consists of seven members performing on guitars, cello, viola, accordion, piano, bass, glockenspiel, ukulele, mandolin, drums, and a plethora of rhythmic accessories. The music can be described as indie-folk, and has been compared to that of The Decemberists, Devotchka, and Bright Eyes.

The band released their first full-length self-produced album, "To Travels & Trunks" in December 2008. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hey+Marseilles">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
