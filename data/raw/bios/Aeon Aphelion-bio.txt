Aeon Aphelion is a doom metal band from Athens, Greece. The early version of the band started in 2005 and was venturing into doom/death territory. It took about 4 years to reach a stable lineup but eventually summer of 2009 saw Aeon Aphelion enter the studio for the first time to record their self-titled "Aeon Aphelion" demo.

2010 was the year the first gigs took place and also a major turning point for the band, as a change in the vocalist position signified the end of the first era and the beginning of a new approach in their sound overall. Growls gave way to clean yet rough singing and most doom/death elements of the song-writing to a mix of traditional doom and heavy metal. With all the pieces into place, the new incarnation of Aeon Aphelion started working on fresh material and in October 2013 the band's debut full-length "Visions of Burning Aeons" was released. 

The following years found the band playing as many gigs as possible and at the same time rehearsing new songs for the next release. Having composed most part of their second album, the band decided to give a taste of what's coming by releasing in March 2020 the "Blind Descent" EP, consisting of 3 brand new songs and a re-recording of a track from the demo.
