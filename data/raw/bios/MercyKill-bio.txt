MercyKill hail from Indianapolis IN and are one of the most talented bands to ever come out of that area. They are five men with a passion for metal and having a great time. Their music is a mix of thrash and death with a hint of pregressive tossed in. The band can boast of having two of the best guitarists you will ever hear, just listen to the tracks "Beyond The Mirror" and "Two Dimensions" from their debut "Throw The Switch" to see what I mean. Why these guys aren't signed yet is a mystery!


Taken from the bands myspace page at   http://www.myspace.com/mercykillonline :

Our quest for world domination began in February of 2005. We released our first EP "Throw the Switch" in January of 2006. "Throw the Switch" has received numerous positive reviews from both local and national media, including PIT magazine and Sounds Of Death (SOD) magazine. We are currently gearing up to record our second EP which we expect to release in early 2008.

So far we've managed to terrorize most of Indiana, Las Vegas, Mesa/Phoenix, Cincinnati, Milwaukee, Chicago, Detroit and a lot of places in between. We have shared the stage with Obituary, Daath, Metal Church, Meliah Rage, Broken Teeth, God Forbid, Full Blown Chaos, Epicurean, Alabama Thunderpussy, hometown dudes Demiricous and Year of Desolation and many more. We will kick your ass in foosball.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/MercyKill">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
