BIO
Face Yourself began as a studio side project for Jackson and Chris, and now has become a full-fledged metal monster.
Face Yourself is a progressive/melodic deathcore outfit with a focus on ambience, residing in Portland, OR. Jackson and Chris are friends who have played in separate bands before and have finally started collaborating on a unique sound. Currently we are getting a demo out and working on an EP, plus finding permanent members to play what we love live.
