Cicatrix was formed by Bartek, Janek, Piotrek and Artek in 1994/1995. These guys after one year of rehearsals have recorded first demo “Unearth”. In 1998 they released second demo – „Disable”, under the Novum Vox Mortiis label, as a split-tape with Heresy. In 1999 band recorded material for their first debut LP “Eviscerated”. In coming next months of 1999 the recording was delayed many times, so the band had to publish this material as a demo in 2000. Also in 2000 Slawek replaced Artur at the drums . Next album “Heading for mental suicide” was recorded in 2001 and released as mcd in 2003. In 2005 band recorded 3-track promo, which was a prediction of future coming, new full length album. “Beloved in Killing” – new album of Cicatrix – was recorded at the breakthrough of 2007/2008. During the recording Kuszol replaced Janek who left the band. The band is recently looking for a publisher and is open for any kind of cooperation.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cicatrix">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
