Vials of Wrath is the solo project of DC Mills - former rhythm guitarist for Bloodline Severed.
It began in the Fall of 2009, a time when he was not currently a member of Bloodline. Inspired by other one-man acts such as Burzum, Striborg and Xasthur, he decided to try self-producing a few songs in the vein of his many influences, but with lyrics that reflected his Christian faith. 
Vials of Wrath was the outcome. His original songs were described as a blend of Christian black metal and death metal, sounding like a mix of older DImmu Borgir, Dissection, Cradle of Filth and Behemoth, but with a completely different lyrical viewpoint.
Vials of Wrath released a split album with another "unblack" metal band, Warfrozen, at the end of March 2011 through indie label Unblack Metal Scene.
A full-length album, "Seeking Refuge," was released independently in April 2013 which took Vials of Wrath in a very different direction. With much more focus on atmosphere and the traditional black metal sound, this album has received many positive reviews, with HM Magazine giving it 4.5 out of 5 stars. Drawing comparisons to Wolves In The Throne Room, Alcest and Agalloch, Vials of Wrath continues to evolveâ€¦ <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vials+of+Wrath">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
