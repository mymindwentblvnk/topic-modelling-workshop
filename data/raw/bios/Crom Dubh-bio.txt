Crom Dubh are a black metal band with heavy influences of post rock and folk, based in London, lyrically and thematically focused upon the mythology and heritage of the British Isles. 

Crom Dubh was formed in the winter of 2003 by M. Beonetleah, S. O'Fairdehaigh and Xavi. A four track demo was recorded within months of this, but was of low quality and therefore not released initially. Subsequently, Crom Dubh recorded six tracks for the ‘Damnation Upon Us’ demo, which was released in a 3 track format. In the winter of 2004, Ro joined Crom Dubh as second guitarist, and in the summer of 2005 the ‘Fallen Sons’ demo was recorded and released. In the same year Xavi and Ro left to pursue other projects, and A. Haege joined on drums, and S. Vrath on guitar.

Crom Dubh is currently M. Beonetleah, S. O'Fairdehaigh, A. Haege, and S. Vrath.

The 'deifr' EP was recorded and released in 2009 by GZE. 

'Omnia Mutantur' a compilation of demos, including the previously unreleased 'Rehearsal Demo', plus 'Damnation Upon Us' and 'Fallen Sons' was uploaded to Bandcamp in 2014. 

Their debut album 'Heimweh' was recorded in 2013 and released in 2015 by Ván Records, Germany.

Their second album, "Firebrands and Ashes", was released in 2019 by Ván Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Crom+Dubh">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
