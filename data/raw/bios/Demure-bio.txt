Also refers to an American artist called Ayanna Guyhto
"The artist currently known as Demure is by no means a stranger to entertainment world. Very early on, she developed a proclivity for the arts. At the tender age of seven, Demure (also known as Ayanna Guyhto) began drawing, and writing short stories and poems. Her talents in these areas were often recognized publicly in her schools, by both Ebony Jr. and Highlights magazines. Her poetic gift has also been documented twice in Kennesaw State University's (where she attended college) literary magazine."
