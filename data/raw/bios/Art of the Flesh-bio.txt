Formed in October of 2004 and rising from the microscopic small town of Lily Lake, a town of less than 1,000 people, Art of the Flesh is a metal band that combines technical heavy riffs with a brutal sense of melody. The elements of the band are defined by: aggressive and infectious vocals, guitars that harmonize while scaling up and down the fret board, bass guitar that pushes the limits of music theory, and drums that contain a healthy mixture of speeding double bass drums and intricate cymbal work. While Art of the Flesh cannot be easily categorized with a particular genre, there are some similarities that can be noticed by listeners. Influences stem from American bands such as Death, Slayer, Pantera, Lamb of God, and foreign bands such as Into Eternity, Children of Bodom, and Opeth. With each passing show, peers and listeners alike are realizing that Art of the Flesh are a force that will need to be dealt with. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Art+of+the+Flesh">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
