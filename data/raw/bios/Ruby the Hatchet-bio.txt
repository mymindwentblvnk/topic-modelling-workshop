Ruby the Hatchet is a five-piece psychedelic rock band from Philadelphia, PA, United States.

Forming after a series of basement practices in New Jersey circa 2011 before relocating to Philadelphia, psychedelic quintet Ruby the Hatchet brought together doomy, evil hard rock with occult-flavored psychedelia for a witchy brew of dazzled and ominous wild rock sounds. The band featured guitarist Johnny Scarps, drummer Owen Stewart, bassist Mike Parise, and keyboard player Sean Hur, and was trademarked by the howling, dynamic vocals of Jillian Taylor. In addition to constant gigging, the band had a prolific recording schedule as well, releasing a self-titled EP in 2011 and their debut full-length Ouroboros the next year. 

In 2014 they released several versions of a single entitled The Eliminator, including a limited-edition release packaged in a wooden box filled with random ephemera. 

All of this made way for the band's 2015 effort Valley of the Snake, a deeper dive into the band's increasingly gritty stoner rock-influenced sound. 

Two years later they dropped Planetary Space Child via Teepee Records.
