Wolvserpent, a project created by collaborators Blake Green and Brittany McConnell, manifested in 2009 in Boise, Idaho.

Wolvserpent's focus is on creative expressions of spirituality, nature, and the occult. The duo's music creates beautifully bleak visuals of the worlds we live in and the worlds we do not. Some of which are vibrant and full. Some that have long turned to dust and been drained of life. Both of which share equal beauty and terror. Within this music exists a forgotten but healing sanctuary. The opportunity to disappear from the fears and stresses of modern living and focus your strengths within, finding honesty, integrity, imagination, joy and the deepest of sorrows. 

This musical expression moves us away from the instant gratification of the disposable music experience and takes us back to the realm of limitless time and possibilities of imagination. Moving away from the song and back to the album, an attempt to rejoin the ranks of theatre, film and visual art as an artistic genre that can provide a deeply spiritual and a broad ranged emotionally connecting experience.

Since the release of the debut EP Blood Seed in 2010 and the re-issued prequel EP Gathering Strengths in 2011. Wolvserpent have completed two DIY US Tours and supported Wolves in the Throne Room on their 2011 "Celestial Lineage" European tour.
