Three bands share the name Immemorial. 

1) Death metal band from Poland formed in 1997 that released two records on Conquer record. Split-up.
1998 - Ius Primae Noctis (demo)
2001 - Monologue (LP)
2003 - After Deny (LP)

2) Project of Damien Luce from HKY who composes ambiant soundscapes influenced by the music of John Carpenter.

3) Band from Finland. This was in fact an early version of Jari Mäenpää's Wintersun. Immemorial recorded one semi-official demo in '97. Some ideas of the Immemorial-era were later re-used for Wintersun. For example, the Immemorial demo features an early version of Wintersun song 'Sadness And Hate'. Jari commented commented on Immemorial in a 2004 interview:
"(Laughs) IMMEMORIAL was just a couple of teenagers playing guitar (me and Oliver Fokin) and trying to make songs. We did some demos using a drummachine - nothing special really." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Immemorial">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
