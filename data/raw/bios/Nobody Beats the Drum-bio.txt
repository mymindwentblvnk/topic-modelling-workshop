To fully appreciate Nobody Beats The Drum's fusion of breaks, electro, hip hop and every other form of music that whips a crowd up into a sweaty, writhing heap of body parts, it's best to see them live. 
At a NBTD show the pounding music created by Sjam's decks and Jori's keys are enhanced by Rogier's visuals to create a sensual assault that's impossible to withstand. As they're fond of saying, resistance is futile â€“ Nobody Beats The Drum.
