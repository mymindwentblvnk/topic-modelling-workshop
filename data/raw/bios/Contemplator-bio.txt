Contemplator is an instrumental progressive metal band from Quebec City, QC, Canada. The musical catharsis of Christian Pacaud, it began in late 2011 as a way to channel anger and frustration into music that is without compromise, a blend of every influence which chaotically comes together.

Antoine Guertin (Aeternam, Southern Cross) joined on drums in 2012, giving the project a renewed focus. Olivier Perrier-Maurel (Southern Cross, Warning Sign) was later brought in for guitars to record the self-titled first album, which was released in August 2013.

Major influences include Porcupine Tree, Gorguts, King Crimson and the composers of the golden era of VGM (Uematsu, Mitsuda, etc.) <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Contemplator">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
