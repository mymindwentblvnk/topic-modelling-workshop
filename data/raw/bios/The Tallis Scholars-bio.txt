Formed in 1973 by their director Peter Phillips, they specialize in performing a cappella sacred vocal music written during the Renaissance by composers from all over Europe.
They are currently recognized as one of the world leaders in this field, having risen to a place of prominence among other professional ensembles.

They record widely on their own label, Gimell Records, which boasts a world-wide distribution and some 40 releases spanning repertoire from over 150 years of music history (approximately the years 1450â€“1600).
Their touring schedule brings them to America at least twice a year and Japan at least once every two years.

They are well known among music lovers and academics alike and have paved the way for many younger groups such as The Sixteen, The Cardinall's Musick, The Clerks Group, The Binchois Consort, Trinity Baroque, and the Gabrieli Consort.

Various members of the group have scholarly interests on top of their activities as professional musicians with Phillips having published a scholarly text ("English Sacred Music 1549-1649": London: Gimell Records, 1991) and Sally Dunkley, Francis Steele, and Deborah Roberts all active as music editors and publishers with interests spanning the Renaissance and early Baroque. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Tallis+Scholars">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
