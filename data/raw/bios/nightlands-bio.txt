Nightlands is the recording project of Philadelphia's Dave Hartley, a bassist and multi-instrumentalist with The War on Drugs. Forget the Mantra, the first and only official release, began as Hartley's attempt to record and archive his dreams by using a simple bedside tape recorder, but quickly ballooned into an epic, multi-year project incorporating dense vocal arrangements and diverse instrumentation.  Hyper-personal life extracts are also sprinkled throughout, including family audio heirlooms and sonically-altered treatments of past, incomplete recording projects. Forget the Mantra will be available November 9th via Secretly Canadian.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nightlands">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
