The dark gothic  death metal formation was founded by singer ''Marnix van Malsen'' and drummer ''Edwin van den Eeden'' both from their late band ''Mortivore''.
They found their raging guitarsounds in ''Patrick Bijl'' (Serenade of Darkness)and ''Patrick Moed'' (Labratory Sickness).

With no bass player Marnix used his keyboard experience to get the dark gothic melodies and sounds in the music.
With this formation they recorded their first album "Facing the dragon".

after edwin van den Eeden left the group to join ''Sinister'' Nymeria struggled searching for a new drummer to take his place.
Later on Kevin van den Heiligenberg followed and replaced Edwin on the drums and keyboard player Jasper van der Burg (Oblivian Nightmare) was added to the band to replace Marnix on the keyboards.
The six headed formation, which originated after bass player Mike Jansen was added to the band, recorded their second album 'In the veil of night' which was first presented at Appelpop festival in september 2011.

Due to personal reasons Patrick Bijl and Jasper van der Burg decided their time with Nymeria had come to an end in march 2013, shortly thereafter guitarist Marc van der Meulen was recruited and filled the spot that once belonged to Patrick Bijl. 

Nymeria is now working on their new album which can be expected in the fall of 2014. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nymeria">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
