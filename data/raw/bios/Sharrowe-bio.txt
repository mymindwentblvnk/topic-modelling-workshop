Sharrowes history starts from year 2002, when Tapio and Samuli started playing together. Soon they had few songs ready, but in this time the music style was progressive metal.

2003 Sharrowe got a keyboard player, and a little later a bass player joined in the band with another guitarist. Still the style was progressive metal.

Samuli started singing in early 2006, and the band's style started to evolve to more traditional metal. In april of 2006 Sharrow played its first gig in a band contest in Juva, and won the contest. Their first bigger gig was in a festival named Landeballooza, and after that the rest is history.

In December 2006 Sharrow recorded Shallow grief EP in Kuopio at Studio 33. Soon style changed to more black metal and band was going to release full album, but was disbanded before that.
