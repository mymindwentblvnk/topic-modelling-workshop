Australian Black Metal in the vein of Deströyer 666.


The Saga thus far... URGRUND…an ancient, indomitable force knowing neither boundary nor peer, realised and unleashed through the medium of destructively heavy, war thrash, with roots in Old German Death, Black metal and the traditional metal style... 


Ideologically Urgrund exalts heathen irreverence and defiance in all its forms: barbarism and the glorification of destruction/war (essential to rebirth and evolution).... Studies of historic facts, Antichristian-ism, heathenism, existence, philosophy, war/death, classic fire and brimstone, secret societies etc.... 


The aggressive music blend with strong parts in subject matter and intergrity is what moulded this band …This is what separates the band from oh so many concept bands that stagnate.....  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Urgrund">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
