Dmitriy Sabekiya aka Intelligent Manners, Russian drum and bass producer/DJ from Saint-Petersburg (Russia’s drum and bass capital) has only recently pushed into the international drum and bass scene with his soulful sounds first released in 2007/2008. Although his first acquaintance with drum and bass music dates back to 1996, it was not until the turn of the millennium when Intelligent Manners started devoting much time to learning making drum and bass. Soul & hip-hop had an influence on his style. And few years later, his first tunes were played by DJ Gvozd on popular Russian drum and bass radio show “Pirate Station”.

In the beginning 2007, DJ Gvozd’s label Respect Records released Intelligent Manners’ debut “Praise The Lord” as part of “Saint Petersburg drum and bass compilation - Respect 6”. With a follow-up release (“Do It Now!” / “I Lost You Baby”) in the spring of 2008 on Russian digital label Liquid Brilliants Records, and more airplay on established UK radio stations such as the Liquid Mondays@KOOL FM and Crissy Criss@1XTRA, Intelligent Manners continues to receive support from the drum and bass scene.

Watch out for a number of forthcoming releases signed on imprints such as Influenza Media (BEL), Golden Orb Records (AUS), All Street Recordings (BRA) as well as Funk Star Records (BEL). And with a string of new releases lined up over the next few months, there is plenty of honey in store from this breaking talent!
