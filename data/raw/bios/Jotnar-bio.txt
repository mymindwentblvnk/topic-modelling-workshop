JOTNAR is an aggressive melodic metal band, which offers a redesigned and modern sound, hitting a potent blend of strong and aggressive rhythms with very pronounced melodies, achieving a perfect balance between both sides and taking modern metal to the next level and thus generating a whole new genre of prolific music. 

The guitars offer powerful and demolishing riffs in combination to smooth melodies, reinforced with the strength and hunger of the insane growls perfectly mixed with catchy melodies and choruses, highlighting the final band’s distinctive signature sound.
