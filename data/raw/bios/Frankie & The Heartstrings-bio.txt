Frankie & The Heartstrings are a 5-piece band from Sunderland, Northeast, United Kingdom. Their first single, 'Hunger/Fragile' was released at the beginning of 2010. According to Songfacts, the song title and lyrics of 'Hunger' pay homage to the Norwegian author Knut Hamsun's 1890 semi-autobiographical novel Hunger, which describes a young writer's descent into near madness as a result of famine, poverty and homelessness.

The band's debut album Hunger was released on 21 February 2011 in the UK.
