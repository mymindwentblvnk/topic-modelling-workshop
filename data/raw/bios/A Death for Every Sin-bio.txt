Inspired by such bands as Merauder, Hatebreed and Integrity, Montreal's A Death for Every Sin formed in the summer of 99 as a reaction to a scene that seemed to have forgotten what HARDcore was about. In years gone by Montreal had become known as a sort of breeding ground for bands influenced by the likes of Union of Uranus and Rorschach.

So with the idea to create a true HARDcore band, Fred found similar thinkers in vocalist Nick Racicot and drummer Ben Dussault, recruited Max Jenniss and Phil Marchand from In Dying Days and began writing. Within months the band had recorded and released a 3-track demo that established them a solid fan-base in Europe, Canada, Japan, and the US.

Following the release of their MCD, ”Gods Final Descent”, on Ontario's Sounds Of Revolution/13th Day Recordings, ADFES went out on the road and began laying waste to the east coast, sharing the stage with the likes of Death Threat, Buried Alive, Throwdown, All Out War and Hatebreed. With their debut full length set for release in winter 2002 and the addition of guitarist Carl Bouchard and bassist Ben Trepanier, ADFES is stronger than ever and have vowed to bring destruction to dance-floors worldwide. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/A+Death+for+Every+Sin">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
