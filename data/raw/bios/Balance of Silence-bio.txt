Balance of Silence was originally formed in early 2003 as a side project between Kris and Li to fill the creative gap in their musical developement. The other members of Kris' previous band SLAVESTATE soon joined the collective, and after a few months of creating the strongest music they had ever written, all projects were ended and Balance of Silence was born!
