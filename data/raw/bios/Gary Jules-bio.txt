Gary Jules (born in 1969 in Fresno, California as Gary Jules Aguirre) is an American singer-songwriter. He is best known for his cover of the Tears for Fears song Mad World, which was featured in the film Donnie Darko.

Gary Jules attended The Bishop's School in La Jolla, California. Some of his early projects/bands were The Ivory Knights, Our Town Pansies, Woodenfish and The Origin.

Jules started off his solo recording career with the debut Greetings from the Side.  Originally released by A & M, this album slipped through the cracks  due to neglect on the label's part, and Jules was dropped.  In 2001, together with friend Michael Andrews, Gary Jules recorded Trading Snakeoil For Wolftickets.  It was from this album that the remake of Tears for Fears' Mad World was subsequently used by Michael Andrews for Donnie Darko.

In December 2003, two years after Donnie Darko was released, Mad World finally reached the charts and became the Christmas Number One in the UK. In early 2004, the song surfaced in the US and Canada.

His most recent album, simply titled Gary Jules was released in 2006. The song Falling Awake from this album was recently used in the season 3 episode Six Days: Part Two of Grey's Anatomy.

Jules' Andrews' arrangement of "Mad World", was recently used in a trailer for the Gears of War for the XBOX 360, it was also used in a few episodes of CSI, Without a Trace, in some episodes of Dead Like Me, in an episode of Jericho, and an episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
