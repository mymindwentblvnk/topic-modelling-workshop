One of the longest-running grindcore bands in France.

Formed in the early 90's by Fred (bass), the band first played death metal but soon evolved into grindcore after a line-up change in 1994. They have always been entirely independant, releasing records and booking shows by themselves through their label Grind Your Soul.

The band's albums follow a concept revolving around "life and the abolition of time", planned to last over 7 albums ("the Heptalogy"). To this day (2013), five albums have been released, with the sixth planned for mid-2013.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Inhumate">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
