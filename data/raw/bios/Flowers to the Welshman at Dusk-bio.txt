Predominantly, but not exclusively, a one-man bedroom band founded by a young Colombian best known in heavy metal circles as reiter.  Taking influences from an internet IRC channel known as #metal, the band is best known for being incredibly self-indulging, and denouncing anyone who doesn't get its music as "being on a lower plane of existence".  reiter has been known to call his music "tr00 metal", drawing comparisons to Manowar, yet the truth is that the latter are much better than any one-man electronic black metal project. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Flowers+to+the+Welshman+at+Dusk">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
