BTK- Basement Torture Killings was formed in the Winter of 07 when past and present members of Thus Defiled and Scarabaeus were forced into a dark, cold, dingy and blood soaked basement in one of Stockholm’s least hospitable suburbs. Part band and part horror movie BTK are quite possibly the sickest musical entity that you will ever encounter.


“The First Cumming” is the debut release from the sickos that are Bertrand, Tarquin and Professor K and features 6 tracks of Gore Obsessed, Death Dealing, Shit Inducing, Old School Death Metal. For more info check out the bands myspace page.


Be warned BTK fully endorse an equal opportunities murder policy, if you can bleed and you can scream then you could be next!
