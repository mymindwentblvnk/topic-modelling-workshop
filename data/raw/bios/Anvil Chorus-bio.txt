Anvil Chorus is a progressive heavy metal band that was a staple to the NWOSFHM scene. (That's New Wave Of San Francisco Heavy Metal!)  Established in 1980, they were the precursor to the infamous Bay Area thrash movement and played legendary shows with Yngwie Malmsteen, Metallica, and Exodus.  Widely known as one of the most talented bands of their time, the melodic and blistering twin axe attack of Piercy and Rasmussen remains Anvil Chorus' trademark.  They have recently reformed.  The current line up is: 

Aaron Zimpel - Vocals, Bass (Metal Church)
Thaen Rasmussen - Guitars (Control, Black Sun, Vicious Rumors)
Doug Piercy - Guitars (Control, Heathen, The Company, Angel Witch)
Joe Bennett - Drums
Phil Bennett - Keyboards
