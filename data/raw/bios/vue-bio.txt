Vue, a band from San Francisco, formed after the breakup of Portraits Of Past. Intially, the band's moniker was "The Audience", yet had to change after legal action from a British band of the same name. From then on, the band was Vue. Their first record, a single was released with GSL Records while the band was still named The Audience. After this release, Sub Pop records offered to release the band's debut album.

Before the album was recorded, Vue released "The Death Of A Girl EP" (2000) with GSL Records. The debut album, released with Sub Pop, followed shortly after, titled "Vue". In 2001, "Find Your Home", the band's second album was released. This features "Pictures Of Me", which was released as a UK only single in 2002.

The band signed to RCA after this, and released the "Babies Are For Petting" EP in 2003. Their third album, "Down For Whatever" was released the same year. In May 2004, the band recorded two more songs, as well as an acoustic version of one of these tracks, supposedly "the latest Vue material in existence". 

The three final members of the Vue have formed a new band called Bellavista.
