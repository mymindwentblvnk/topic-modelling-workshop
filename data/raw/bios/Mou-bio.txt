There are two artists sharing the name Mou;

The name is used by :
1. Italian Dub project 
2. Mexican Shoegaze band

MOU was the brainchild of Paolo Picone to be a one man band in the year 2001. Not satisfied with the solo project, he decides to integrate other instruments such as bass, drums, vocals, synth and samplers. With all the vital ingredients in place MOU was complete as a musical unit. In 2002 the band gets the opportunity of a lifetime representing the whole CAMPANIA region at the Arezzo Wave Love Festival competition. MOU plays an incredible set and wins it all!!! Upon winning the festival, MOU becomes heavily requested all over the main land and plays shows from the top to the bottom of the huge peninsula. They soon rise like a phoenix in the dub/drum n bass scene, especially in Naples, which is famous for its underground musical scene. MOU brought a refreshing true sound back to the scene, which was welcomed by all in the Naples. As a result, MOU played many shows in the region eventually headlining the legendary venue known as Officina 99. There long awaited debut EP called NTAIN VIBES was finally recorded and released in 2004. The title of the album symbolizes two aspects of the bands background. First, the album symbolizes the roots of the band, which was formed by members who all live in the mountainous reigns of Southern Italy. Secondly, the vibes aspect pays homage to the 1980 massive earthquake which struck the area, which ultimately led to most of the population immigrating to foreign countries. This massive movement inspired the band to title one of their singles little Italy by phone. The bands intensity is matched by no one and when a concert goer experiences a live set by MOU they feel the same vibrations SHAKE THE GROUND BENEATH THEIR FEET!!!!!!!!!!  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mou">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
