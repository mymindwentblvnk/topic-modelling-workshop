The Pinker Tones are the brainchild of Barcelona natives Mister Furia and Professor Manso. The group's music is an eclectic and explosive cocktail mixing pop, funk, soul, bossa, break beat, swing, lounge, and psychedelia. Their songs feature Spanish, French, English, and German lyrics.

Since the release of ‘The Million Color Revolution’ on the band's own label Pinkerland Records (founded by the band and UK label Outstanding Records) & Latin alternative label Nacional Records, The Pinker Tones have played more than 300 shows in over 40 countries. The group have developed a killer live show with the invaluable help of DJ Niño. Their Pinker Tones DJ Crew combines the intensity of a rock band and the excitement of a DJ set. They have performed in New York, Moscow, Beijing, London, Amsterdam, Berlin, Rome, Madrid, Buenos Aires, Bogota, Caracas, Puerto Rico, Los Angeles, Johannesburg, Toronto, as well as many other world cities. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Pinker+Tones">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
