Linearwave is the project of Brazil-based composer Yuri Bastos that focuses on lo-fi hip-hop, music made to forget about everyday life and get into introspection. Created in August 2018 and with more than 150M streams, the project has reached an audience around the world. With a soft and relaxing sound, the tracks are influenced by different styles such as bossa nova, electronic music, hip-hop, and ambient music. They take the listener to a moment of peace, in which it is possible to forget the madness of the contemporary world and relax for a few minutes. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Linearwave">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
