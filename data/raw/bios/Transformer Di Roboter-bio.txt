Transformer Di Roboter are from Berlin. Now Called TRANSFORMER, they mix sophisticated bleepy electronics with Slayer and Michael Jackson covers as well as their own "original" material.
They have played tons of Shows across Europe and now play a very energetic Show with a rock drummer called Marco Barotti. They don't play covers anymore, but they do quote a lot of Pop music and culture during their live shows which are quite memorable.
They have released EPs on labels such as Deco, Planet Mu, Diamondtraxx, WMFrec as well as Ann Shentons and many other compilations. They are often quoted for using the Mac startup sound as a bassline. Visual Artist and VJ Arno Coenen has created a video show to accompany the Transformer live show. They have untill 2010 not released a full length album.
