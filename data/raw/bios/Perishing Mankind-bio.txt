Perishing Mankind is an Austrian "underground" band and makes Thrash Fused Melodic Death Metal.

Perishing Mankind was founded in May 2001 and is made up of the joint skills of holger, georg, gernot, paul and beat!e. This project got going by playing lots of shows all over Austria as well as in neighbouring countries (ger, slo, hu, it).

In March 2005 they signed a record deal and recorded their first full-length album "Fall of Men", which was released via Black Lagoon records in July 2005. Responses to the material where highly positive, both from reviewers and audience, and they decided to hold straight on, writing new songs and intensifying their live-presence.

In the summer of 2006 they signed a contract with Noisehead Records, and in November they recorded their second full-length, “Wonderland”. it was released March 2007, again receiving positive feedback.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Perishing+Mankind">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
