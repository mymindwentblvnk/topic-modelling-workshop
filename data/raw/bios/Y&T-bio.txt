Y&T (originally known as Yesterday & Today) is an American hard rock/heavy metal formed in 1974 in Oakland. They hail from the East Bay of the San Francisco Bay Area. The band released two studio albums on London Records as Yesterday & Today in the 70s before shortening their name to Y&T and releasing several albums on A&M Records, beginning their new life in 1981. Y&T was originally notably co-managed by Herbie Herbert (who has also managed rock groups Journey and Mr. Big) and Louis "Lou" Bramy. They've also released albums on other notable labels such as Avex Records. Altogether, they've sold over 4 million albums worldwide to date.

The original members of Y&T were Dave Meniketti (lead vocals and lead guitar), Leonard Haze (drums), Phil Kennemore (bass), and Joey Alves (rhythm guitar). Haze was replaced by Jimmy DeGrasso in 1986. Alves was replaced by Stef Burns in 1989. The band officially disbanded in 1991, although they continued to perform sporadically. They officially reunited in 2001 with a lineup of Meniketti, Kennemore, and Burns alongside Leonard Haze. Burns eventually went on to join the pop rock outfit Huey Lewis & The News and was replaced by John Nymann. Nymann was an old friend of the band who had sung backup for the group before. In 2006, Haze was asked to step down, and he was replaced by Mike Vanderhule.

The band's signature hits include "Summertime Girls", a Van Halen like piece of cheeky arena rock that reached #55 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1985, and ""Mean Streak."  That latter track hiked up to #25 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock chart due to its aggressive, heavy style. Y&T's 1984 album, 'In Rock We Trust', has been their highest selling release, reaching #46 on the Billboard Album Charts and selling over 450,000 copies; the spirited album came very close to Gold status.
