Eduard Khil (Eduard Anatolyevich Khil, or Эдуа́рд Анато́льевич Хиль in Russian, September 4, 1934 – June 4, 2012) was a Russian baritone, well known in his country from his singing in the 1960s and later. He fell into obscurity with the fall of the Soviet Union. He is best known in the Anglosphere for his 1976 hit transliterated into English as "I am very glad, because I'm finally returning back home" (often called "Trololo", "Trolololo", "Trololololo", or similar names) due to internet attention. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Eduard+Khil">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
