Total may refer to multiple acts:

1. Total is a British experimental/noise project formed in 1984 by Matthew Bower after the break up of Pure. Originally industrial oriented, Bower received occasional help from members of Ramleh and Ake. But towards the later 1980's the sound became more guitar oriented, and a group was formed which was name Skullflower, which ended Total. In the early 1990's, Matthew brought back the Total name to release his solo music aside from Skullflower. Although almost the releases by the second incarnation of Total are Matthew alone, towards the end he was joined by John Godbert, making Total a duo.

2. Total were an American R&B girl group formed in 1994. They made their first appearance singing the hook on The Notorious B.I.G.'s debut single, "Juicy". Garnering attention for the new group, they were also featured on the original version and "Hip Hop Remix" of his next single "One More Chance". They then immediately hit the studio with Bad Boy Records CEO Sean "Puffy" Combs and began work on their debut album. In their last official appearance together, they were thanked in the credits for their collaboration with Da Beatminerz and Talib Kweli - Anti-Love Movement in 2001 from their album Brace 4 Impak.
