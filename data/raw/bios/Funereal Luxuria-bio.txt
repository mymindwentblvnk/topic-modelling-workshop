Truly hideous ( now disbanded )band from Italy with unnerving screams. The music is minimalistic, noisy and slow, though with an occational up-tempo section of madness. Sort of like a mixture of Dolorian style doom/black, funeral doom in the vein of Worship and Wormphlegm and something which can best be described as very dark jazz. This band often ignores rhythms and instead focuses on a filthy atmosphere. Very creepy band in the insane kind of way.
