There is more than one artist with this name:

1. Doom Metal band from Lakewood, Ohio, United States.

2. Centrifuge are a four piece from Stoke-on-Trent, UK, and at the best of times can be described as mathematical noisy bastards. 

They have a real website at www.centrifuge1.co.uk aswell as the normal gay www.myspace.com/centrifuge. Both of these links will provide details on how to get their new EP, 'Lizard in the Wires' that has had rave reviews including national press in the form of Rocksound.
