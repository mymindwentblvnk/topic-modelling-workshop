Nad Navillus is primarily Dan Sullivan, whose guitar playing shows a wide range of style, but primarily displays the influence of his peers. His stark voice, skillful guitar playing, and intelligent arrangements make his albums sound similar to others, but with legs enough to stand on their own. Utilizing friends and family, his songs showcase a strength that the average singer/songwriter lacks through playing just the acoustic guitar. Sullivan takes both acoustic and electric guitar and backs them up with a full band, while still keeping the powerful voice and guitar combo intact.

Dan Sullivan had been playing guitar for many years, but his first formal album wasn't until 1999 with the release of his self-titled album on ProShop. The label was a collaboration amongst musicians, including Sullivan, but folded soon after the release of the release of his debut. His sophomore album saw a change of pace: whereas the first album was entirely guitar, the second album, released in 2001 on Jagjaguwar saw the first showcase of Sullivan's voice, as well as a full backing band. His third album, Iron Night, was released in 2002, once again on Jagjaguwar. In the midst of making his own music, Sullivan was also involved with helping Parker Paul on his Wingfoot album. He also played with Songs: Ohia for two years and recorded with the band on Mi Sei Apparso Come un Fantasma and Magnolia Electric Co. In what little spare time he has left, he plays with his brother and others in the Butcher Shop Quartet, a group of individuals dedicated to re-creating classical music (including Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring) with electric guitar and other modern rock instruments. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nad+Navillus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
