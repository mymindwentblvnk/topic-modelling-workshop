Turzi is a French band led by Romain Turzi. Their first album "A" came out in 2007 on Record Makers (after an LP "Made under Authority" produced by Romain Turzi alone and released on the same label)

Played with the instruments of Rock (drums, guitars, bass, synths), Turzi define their own music as 'rock disciplinaire' (disciplinary rock), as each track is structured around a rhythm and different sound patterns which are repeated, amplified and modified as each piece is played. The most noticable influences are krautrock, for the obsession with rhythm, and progressive rock, for the experimental feel and search of new sounds. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Turzi">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
