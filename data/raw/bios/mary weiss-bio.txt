Mary Weiss is the former lead singer of legendary girl group the Shangri-Las. She released a solo album called Dangerous Game on Norton Records in 2007, the first album of new material since 1965. The backing band on the album was garage rockers the Reigning Sound .

Mary was fifteen years old when she and her sister Elizabeth (Betty) began singing with identical twins Margie and Mary Ann Ganser in their Cambria Heights neighborhood of Queens, New York, as students at Andrew Jackson High School. They soon came to the attention of George "Shadow" Morton and shot into the charts with massive hits on the Red Bird label including Remember (Walking In The Sand), Leader Of The Pack, Give Him A Great Big Kiss, I Can Never Go Home Anymore, Give Us Your Blessings and Out In The Streets.

The Shangri-Las gave a voice to real teenagers, with Mary's explosive lead vocals delivering emotion-packed melodramas that made them one of the most consistently exciting groups of the day. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mary+Weiss">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
