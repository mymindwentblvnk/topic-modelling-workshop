Baby Ray & The Ferns were one among the many group names used in the early 1960s by Frank Zappa before he formed the Mothers of Invention.  During his stay in Cucamonga, California, Frank Zappa cooperated with studio owner and producer Paul Buff and others to release various singles for the local market. 

They contain traditional rhythm and blues and doo-wop music with fantasy group names as "Baby Ray and the Ferns", Mr. Clean, Bob Guy, The Rotations and The Hollywood Persuaders. These singles are some of the few recordings to which the Zappa Family Trust doesn't have the copyrights. During recent years these tracks have appeared on small labels with titles as Cucamonga Years or Rare Meat. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Baby+Ray+&+The+Ferns">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
