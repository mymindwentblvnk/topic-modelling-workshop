There are two bands with the name White Car.

1) A Chicago-based electro-industrial/EBM duo Elon Katz & Orion Martin as WHITE CAR. 
 
2) A humble, silver light of unmitigated craftwork, Drew Wiltsey of White Car was the first artist to be signed to Nueva Forma. His appearance, while mild-mannered in pre-performance and intellect, explodes into a gyrating and bobbing fury on stage, employing similar activity among his hypnotized crowd.

That same level of movement and passion is released in White Carâ€™s music, with inspiration spanning the ranges of Dada to typography; book design to cats. It may then come as no surprise that White Car is hardly a captive to genres, and although associated with electronica in the broadest sense, comprises many spectrums of sound conforming to no particular nomenclature. One must never expect any particular White Car album to sound the same. That is the provocation of White Car; never dull, and most tasteful to those in appreciation of his lush and ever-evolving experimentation. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/White+Car">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
