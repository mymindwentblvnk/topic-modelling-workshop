Red Stars Theory form dream-like melodies, awash in layers of sound, mixed with the more agressive sound of the band's indie and punk roots. Red Stars Theory was formed early in late 1994, when James Bertram started playing with Tonie Palmasani, Jeremiah Green and Jason Talley. They got together and found that something just clicked. In Spring and Summer 1995 the group wrote and recorded an eponymous 10-inch EP on Deluxe Records and the "Slow Curve/Castle Rock" 7-inch single on Rx Remedy. Seth Warren was invited to play violin on the Rx Remedy LP/CD But Sleep Came Slowly, and has since been a full-time member of the group. 

Red Stars Theory has been a slow-moving band due to numerous other musical projects of its members. The group took a hiatus for several years following the release of an eponymous EP for Touch & Go in 2000. Suicide Squeeze re-released the Deluxe 10-inch and Rx Remedy 7-inch as a CD in 2001. Red Stars Theory contributed the track "Evergreen and Ivorbean" to Suicide Squeeze's 10th anniversary compilation, Slaying Since 1996.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Red+Stars+Theory">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
