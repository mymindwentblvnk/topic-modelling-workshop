In 2008 when the Romanian nation became full of gore and shit, a band needed to appear to bring a dose of humanity to those still alive. That band was Goreationed. The cyber-grind band worked deeply underground untill the 24-th of August release of the song "Shadows" extracted from the first Promo EP "A Nation Of Gore Like Never Before". The EP was launched as a mocking of the 2009 Romanian Presidential Election, both the front cover and the song "Zombescu" paying their deep disgust and disrespect to current president Traian Basescu and the whole political class. Currently the Promo Ep is avaidable for download on myspace but the band is already working of their new material due to appear in late 2010. On the 19th of December 2009 the band launched the song "20 Years" that "celebrated" 20 years of Romanian "freedom". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Goreationed">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
