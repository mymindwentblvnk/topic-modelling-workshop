Apollyon Sun was the Industrial outfit of Tom Gabriel Fischer from Celtic Frost. Tom announced in an interview with PyroMusic.net (May 2007) that Apollyon Sun had officially disbanded, and were unlikely to ever reform or release new material.
Apollyon Sun was formed by singer/guitarist Tom G. Fischer and guitarist Erol Unala in early 1995. The band were first discovered in 1997 by London-based Sanctuary Music Management, on the strength of their Industry Demonstration demo-EP. Their debut EP "God Leaves (And Dies)" was released in 1998. Misunderstood by many of the 'old-school' fans of Celtic Frost, probably due to the fact that it was so avant-garde and experimental. The full length album "Sub" moved forward into the industrial world to embrace the electronic age and mix heavy guitar riffs and drum rhythms with poetic lyrics. It had overall good reviews and acceptance by the press but the band never had too much exposure and it remained the most underground as it could possibly get. 

After the release of "Sub", the band was dismantled and it's future is uncertain though it has been rumoured that Erol Unala alone would bring up the project to the daylight again now that Tom G. is focusing on Celtic Frost again.
