Emptiness Before Dawn (commonly abbreviated to EBD or ExBxDx as typeset on the demo) is a raw black metal band from Dallas, Texas. Formed in 2006 by Glot and began originally as a one-man project. Soon, Glot enlisted Sayuri and Makoto to expand EBD to a full band project. One demo was recorded under this lineup before going back to Glot solo.

Glot is currently recording a full-length album titled "Unending Darkness of Soom". According to Glot, the album will be a mix of funeral doom and black metal and currently does not have a release date. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Emptiness+Before+Dawn">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
