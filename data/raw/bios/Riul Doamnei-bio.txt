Riul Doamnei is a symphonic black metal band from Italy founded  in 1999. They currently have five releases (1 demo, 2 EPs and 2 full-lengths) and a new album is on the way.

They play a very melodic/symphonic style and commonly combine keyboards with melodic guitar riffs. The music is well-balanced, so it is neither too symphonic nor too raw. 

Riul Doamnei means 'the lady's river' in Romanian. The band is still active.
