Brain Sodomy was started by Mazen Farah from Dismembered as a side-project. Dismembered members used to play both Brain Sodomy and Dismembered tracks live. Mazen managed to release a demo under Brain Sodomy moniker, which Dismembered didn't manage to achieve. Joseph Kalouch, also from Dismembered, recorded session vocals for the demo. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Brain+Sodomy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
