In January of 2008, Gates Of Winter released their debut album, 'Lux Aeterna', produced by Miguel Gauthier at Stereo Soul Studios in Sault Ste Marie, Ontario. After roughly a year of promotion and touring, the band hit a wall of personal conflicts, and decided to take an indefinite hiatus from performing.

Recently, although separated still by ongoing work and education, the group has decided to begin writing and preparing for a second album. Inspired greatly by a myriad of experiences since the release of Lux Aeterna, this album promises to be a compositional maturation, and a darker evolution of their previous works.

As of the summer of 2011, the band is well into the process of developing new material, and is close to the completion of it's first full length demo from the new album.
