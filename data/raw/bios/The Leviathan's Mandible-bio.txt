Music speaks in ways words will never be able to portray so TLM's songs are the audio equivalent of our souls being barred for the world. we don't do this for fame, we do it for the love of music. we have and will always be a band that sticks to and supports DIY ethics. 

TLM Has opened for and played with bands such as Everything falls together, Flesh and blood robot, Closed casket funeral, Terminally your aborted ghost, Ion dissonance, Circle of dead children, Triumph of gnomes, Anal Cunt, Success Will Write Apocalypse Across The Sky, Maruta, Triac, Anal blast, Swamp gas, Skew, Today is the day, Putrid Pile, Baby Basher, Dead Flesh, Rampant Decay, Okosu, Unmen and many more. 

The Leviathan's Mandible formed in 2004 by Trickie and Josh with just guitar,drum machine and vocals. Fred joined 2006 on bass then moved to guitar to thicken the sound. Daniel was brought in in early 2007 on bass around the same time the band decided to go with real drums so Josh moved from guitar to drums. Daniel left the band in late 2007 and TLM decided to carry on as a 3 piece.
