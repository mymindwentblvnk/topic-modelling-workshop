- NightSky was a depressive black metal project from the United States, formed by Skog in 2004. The project collaborated with a small handfull of musicians online. The project began originally in Florida. Skog relocated to Alaska for a period of time, then back to Florida. While in Alaska in 2008, the recordings for "The Snow Glows In My Veins" were completed by Dispater and Skog. The tracks were never released officially. In 2009, Skog sent promos of the planned EP to a few labels, and "The Snow Glows In My Veins" was released the following year on both cassette tape by Depressive Illusions Records and then on cd by Svartgalgh Records. Both releases featured different artwork, but the same tracklisting. This is the final release by NightSky.
