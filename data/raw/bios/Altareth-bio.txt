Altareth is a band from the Swedish west coast based in Gothenburg that plays psychedelic doom metal. Members: Rolling, Wicked Nick, Blomman, Swempa, Magic Paddy. Facebook, Bandcamp.

The four pillars of the Altareth sound are clean vocals, fuzzy guitars, pounding drums and fat electric bass guitar. The basic idea and musical foundation of Altareth is the meeting of heavy riffs and memorable melodies. Dualisms have always haunted real rock music and Altareth builds on tradition. 

Groovy doom metal songs about armageddon, darkness, evil, magic, the forces of nature and the insignificance of man. Influenced by Black Sabbath, Electric Wizard, Jex Thoth to mention just a few.
