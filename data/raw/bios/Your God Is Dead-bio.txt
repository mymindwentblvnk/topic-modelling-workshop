Based out of basically Kortrijk, the heart of the notorious h8000 area in Belgium.
They stopped playing in December 2007. RIP YGID

features Guitarist Matthias Halsberghe, drummer Tim Jult, guitarist Filip Malbranke ,the recently new bassist Kevin Loosveld and vocalist Hans Verbeke.

From the remains of Belgium legends LIAR and CONGRESS emerges a new spawn of metal-hardcore mayhem. YOUR GOD IS DEAD is the name behind this musical outfit of aggressive riffage, breakneck drumming, crushing thrash and hateful vocals. Born out of the collective ideas of Hans, Matthias, Filip, Kevin and Tim, YGID combines years spent in the heart of underground music where commitment and longevity are stronger than passing fads and overnight trend riders. These 5 men are taking their love for hardcore and metal in order to create a powerful and abrasive quintet of headbanging, mosh provoking mayhem. YOUR GOD IS DEAD is a collective of different ideas and life philosophies. YGID stands for a lifestyle where your weakness is your enemy and anything other than progress is your death. Lyrically YGID stands against stagnation and passive acceptance into anthems for strength, power and triumph. The legacy of H8000 continues with YGID as heirs to that throne. Welcome YOUR GOD IS DEAD into the halls of destruction.

The music of YGID combines the most intense elements of metal , hardcore and circle pit punk. There's no limits in the goal of making heavy and brutal stuff , drawing influence from the trade marking h8000 metalcore sounds and adding some Pantera, early Killswitch Engage, 100 demons, Terror, Entombed and a ton of own creativity and style of course.
