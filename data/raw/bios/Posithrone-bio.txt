POSITHRONE - currently located in Vienna, Austria - is a developing group of human and non-human musicians creating musical outputs in the hard and dark way. POSITHRONE is not willing to fulfil expected stereotypes set by musical categories. The band combines elements of Symphonic Metal, Doom, Technical Black Metal, Classical Music and even Sleaze-Rock to a unique dark spacey hybridization. Take it, or leave it!
