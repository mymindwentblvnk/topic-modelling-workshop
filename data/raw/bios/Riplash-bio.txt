The members of the London metal band RIPLASH follow a philosophy of open mindedness and on-going ambition when it comes to their band. Faster can always be faster, heavy can always be heavier and good can always get better. Founded in 2004 by Marc Herscovitch, Jeff Harding, Brendan O'Carroll and Brett Jones, they have always been searching for a unique style. 

After releasing the 2005 E.P Kill The Infection, the members of Riplash realized they needed something more. Experimenting with different musical techniques and styles, Riplash found the path that led to their present style. After a show in late September of '05, Riplash was approached by Nick Fetchison who was interested in jamming with the band, and after a few jam sessions with Nick, the band decided that he would be final link in the Riplash line up. Since then, the band has written several new songs that have further developed their unique style and have lost Jeff Harding along the way, with Nick taking over vocal duties.

As of 2007(?) the members of the band are based in Toronto. They are now a three-piece, with Brendan on lead/rhythm guitar and vocals, Dr. Jones on bass, and Marc handling percussion.
