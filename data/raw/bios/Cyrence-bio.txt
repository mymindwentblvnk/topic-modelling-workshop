CYRENCE, started in 2006 as a solo project of Tim Grathwohl (Vox and Guitar, Ex-ONE MORE DAY/Ex-GATECRUSHER). In early 2009 CYRENCE became a full band, featuring bassist Sebastian Moser of SHAPESHIFT/CYNICISM and Chris Boenisch on drums. In late 2009, drumming duties were handed over to Lenz Scharf (SICK SOUL/Ex- A-RECORDZ/Ex-GATECRUSHER). With Artur Vladinovskij on Lead Guitar, the line-up was complete from late 2009 until April 2010. Due to conflicting schedules, Artur and CYRENCE parted ways, but soon a new axeman was found as Dominic Millett joined the band in May 2010. Unfortunately, Basti and Lenz decided to leave the Band in June 2011, so CYRENCE is currently looking for a new drummer and bassist. 

CYRENCE play Melodic Thrash Metal in the vein of Megadeth, Metallica and Anthrax. The style is very unique, there are no boundaries. You will enjoy a shitload of neckbreakers as well as clean, almost psychedelic moments, always maintaining the right amount of heaviness, groove and melody. The lyrics cover a wide range of topics, from Nuclear Holocaust to Zombies, Penis and Cake... you see, they're funny guys.. or at least they try!
