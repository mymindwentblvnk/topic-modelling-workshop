1: Abhorrence, Finnish death metal band (1989-)
Originally formed in 1989, which disbanded after just one year in 1990. They released their famous "Vulgar Necrolatry" demo tape, that was in heavy circulation in the underground tape trading scene. The demo was followed by a self-titled EP, which was released by Seraphic Decay records, label which was infamous for ripping off the bands whose music they released. 
In 2012 Svart Records released Completely Vulgar, a compilation album (CD/2LP) with both the demo and EP with enhanced sound quality and additional low grade rehearsal and live material as bonuses. The band briefly reunited for a few reunion gigs in 2013, including a performances at Tuska Open Air Metal Festival and Hammer Open Air Metal Festival. 
The band forgot to disband and after Waltteri VÃ¤yrynen joined as the new drummer in 2016, the band activated properly. They recorded new tracks in 2018, which were released as Megalohydrothalassophobic EP.
