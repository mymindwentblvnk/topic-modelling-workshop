One of the most important, if not wildly popular, bands of the late 20th/early 21st century Athens, GA music scene, Heros Severum managed to take elements of angular punk and post-punk (Wire and the Minutemen come immediately to mind) and combine them into something wholly original.  Heros Severum played it's first show Halloween 2000 and last show Halloween 2006 existing for precisely 6 years. 

An accomplished producer in his own right, guitarist/vocalist Eric Friar, along with producer J. Robbins (Jawbox/Burning Airlines) recorded 2 albums during the band's too-short life.  Eric, along with second guitarist/vocalist/songwriter Mandy Branch (there was never a bassist in Heros Severum), have now formed Down With The Woo, which picks up where Heros Severum left off, but with more electronic elements. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Heros+Severum">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
