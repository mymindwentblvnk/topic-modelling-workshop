Mike Gao is a producer and music technologist from Los Angeles.  He has released under All City Dublin, HW&W Records, Alpha Pup, Project Mooncircle, Do Hits and more.

He invented the iPad app, Polyplayground in 2011 to create his music (his work has predated and been cited in Ableton's Push patent). In 2009, he created an iPhone app to recognize your vocal beatbox and turn it into MIDI, which was also more earlier than Ableton's beatbox 2 MIDI efforts.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mike+Gao">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
