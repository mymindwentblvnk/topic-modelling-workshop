"Put the melody in the groove. Until faraway, even without voice"

toconoma was formed by (Gt.)Kotaro Ishibashi　(Ba.)Ray Yako　(Dr.)Ikuya Shimizu　(Pf.)Ryutaro Nishikawa. They met during training program of a group company after graduating university and thought of starting up a band. They all liked [BRAHMAN] and [HI-STANDARD] during high school, which is the kind of music they had been doing until then.
