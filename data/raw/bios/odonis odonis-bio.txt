Based out of Toronto, Canada, Odonis Odonis came into being in 2010, taking its name from a mate of bandleader, Dean Tzenos, who was unforgettably called Adonis Adonis. Wrapping every song with deep sea reverb and cold fingertips, Odonis Odonis distills the vitals of pop and experimentation.

Molded at a young age by the sounds of indie, new wave and industrial mix-tapes passed on by Deanâ€™s elder sisters, Odonis Odonis harkens to The Jesus & Mary Chain, Pixies, Big Black and The Cure. Like a good post-modernist, however, these influences merely colour, but do not define Odonis Odonis. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Odonis+Odonis">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
