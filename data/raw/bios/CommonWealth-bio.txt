Founded in 2016, featuring ex-members of Movements and Hotel Books, Commonwealth describe themselves as “honest music for the worn out soul,” that’s conveyed with a subtle, ethereal style of post-rock infused alternative musicianship with melancholic, whimsical lyricism and poignant vocal delivery. Energetic enough to remain catchy and engaging while somber and sobering enough to speak through to the listener’s soul, Commonwealth is a unique band built on a platform of authentic passion, appealing to fans of atmospheric post-hardcore, pop-punk and alt-rock all with one sprawling, all-encompassing dynamic.

While the band is young and have a few songs to their name, they’ve gained vast experience and a solid foundation from a dedicated work ethic, which has led to them playing alongside Set Sights and Modern Color in support of 2016’s critically acclaimed single, “Father(s).” A harrowing and personal track detailing strained family dynamics and loss alike, the song served as an initial introduction to the band’s incredible potential. This became more evident with the release of “Vinyl” in 2017.

Since then, Commonwealth has been relatively quiet, collecting themselves for their next big move—joining SharpTone’s roster and releasing their forthcoming debut full-length record. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/CommonWealth">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
