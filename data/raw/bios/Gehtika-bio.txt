With a penchant for solid mechanised pummelling metal, mixed with dark and raw thrashing rage, GEHTIKA unleash their second EP, ‘This New World’, on October 18th 2010.  

Warwickshire based Gehtika formed in 2008 with the intention of creating bone crushing metal fury and after a successful debut EP release in 2009 the band concentrated on touring their ferociously paced live shows across the UK, displaying  a combination of fast paced aggressive riffs, savage drumming, intricate solos and frenzied vocals. 

The band have returned with their second EP ‘This New World’, inspired by their personal struggles as a band and their experience of living in a bleak modern society, forced fed lies by the political elite. 

The remainder of 2010 will see the band tour the length and breadth of the UK in support of their EP release.  GEHTIKA are determined to leave a lasting impression on the British underground metal scene. The ‘This New World’ EP is released October 18th, 2010
