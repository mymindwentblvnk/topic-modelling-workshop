Kill For Satan comprises members from well known and respected Australian metal acts (Armoured Angel, Psychrist, Exceed). KFS formed in 2002 initially as a cover band playing tribute to classic eighties thrash bands such as Slayer, Exodus, Bathory, Venom, Dark Angel, Sodom, Kreator, Celtic Frost, Hellhammer, Destruction and many more. As a natural progression, KFS began writing original material in early 2004 for their first release. Thy Kingdom Undone features seven tracks of the Metal of Death in the vein of the bands they had previously paid homage to.
