There are two bands named Hallucinator. (1) An electronic group formed in London in 1996 and (2) a death/thrash metal band from Oakland, California formed in 2014.

 Formed in London in 1996 by Edward George, Anna Piva,and Trevor Mathison, Hallucinator’s music explores dub and electronica processes and forms while also blurring the distinction between art and popular music with an expanding body of work which includes television and theatre soundtracks, performance art, remixes and original recordings.

Hallucinator have contributed original music to the science fiction film Memory Room 451 [ZDF/ARTE,1997], the BBC TV documentary Behind Closed Doors [1998] and the experimental Russian documentary Universal Substitute [A&J Velikanov, 2002].  

There is also a strong symbiosis between the music of Hallucinator and the sound art of multi media artists Flow Motion. Ghost Dance and Ghost Version, re-workings of Flow Motion’s installation Ghost Dance, were released on the Pompidou Centre’s Sonic Process CD, [Milan Music, Fr, 2002]. Invisible 0.1, a reworking of materials from Piva and George’s Invisible, was created for the web project ‘Signal – new sound works for empty space’ [2007] and can be downloaded via www. finetuned.org/signal/hallucinator/.

Hallucinator’s forays into the arts have also resulted in soundscapes for work by other artists, such as Coco Fusco theatre piece The Incredible Disappearing Woman [USA/ICA UK, 2002] and Ki - Keiko Courdy’s  performance piece Aya Mod 2 [Canada, 2004]. In 2000 Japanese choreographer Saburo Tashigawara invited the group to contribute a track to his CD project Absolute Zero, for which they created Messenger.

Hallucinator have also been invited to contribute tracks to several culturally resonant remix projects.  The group produced 21 Aspects of Female  Divinity and Chang Tzel  for the Tibetan Lama, Gangchen Rimpoche, and his United Voices for Peace CD project [Irma Records 2002]. Working in the jazz-electronica vein Hallucinator also produced Mas Que Nada for Irma records’ remix project based around the work of Dom Romao, percussionist with jazz fusion pioneers Weather Report.

In 2006 Berlin based producers Mark Ernestus and Moritz Von Oswald aka Rhythm & Sound invited Piva and George to contribute a remix to their dub-techno project See Mi Yah. The result, See Mi Yah [Hallucinator Remix], [Burial Mix, 2006] featured vocals from Willi Williams, Jamaican singer/songwriter and veteran of pioneering Jamaican record label Studio One.

Hallucinator’s longest and most notable association has been with Ernestus and Von Oswald’s electronica label Chain Reaction. Over a five year period Chain Reaction released Hallucinator’s debut album, Landlocked, a series of extended singles  - Morpheus, Frontier, Red Angel, Black Angel, and their debut recording, People [1998], which was dedicated to the memory of Stephen Lawrence, the black British teenager whose murder would transform British race relations. 

Hallucinator are currently working on the final tracks for their new Chain Reaction album and are also reshaping the sonic components from Flow Motion’s Invisible  for an album to be released in late 2008.
