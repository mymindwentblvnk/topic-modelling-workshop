Damnation Army is a black metal one man band from Sweden , with 2 demos already released and quickly sold out, Damnation Army has been steadily carving out a nice niche in the Underground while still maintaining a "cult" status. In early 2003 the first demo MCD "Towards Damnation" was released and received positiive reviews.

The new Damnation Army album was recorded in december 2007. Once again Thomas Nyholm worked with Tore Stjerna in Necromorbus studio and once again the upcoming album will be released under the banner of Mascot Records. The album will see the dark of night in 2008. The new material is a dynamic brute force of melody and rythmic playing, all presented with a sinister attitude. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Damnation+Army">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
