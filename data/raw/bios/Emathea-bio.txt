From Emathea's GarageBand.com profile... CHECK OUT: http://www.emathea.com. We are two guys who played in several bands, and different styles of music. One day in November last year, we met and started a new band: EMATHEA. We wrote 3 songs in a month, and found 4 other guys to join the group. We recorded a 6 track ep, in mai, and it was released 2 weeks ago. We also played at kvinesdalrockfestival.no 15th of juli at 12 AM, right before TURBONEGRO hit the stage at 2 PM.
