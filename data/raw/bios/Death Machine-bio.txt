DEATH MACHINE attempts to combine the grandiose with nearness. Inspired by traditional American folkmusic and the eighties scifi-sounds. Death Machine seeks to create an honest expression, based on Jesper's personal lyrics and songwriting style. Jesper's fascination with the universe, its incomprehensibility and mystery in general is also expressed through the cinematic and deserted futuristic landscapes. Interaction between acoustic elements and old synthesizers sets the tone.

DEAT MACHINE's musical expression is a mixture between traditional folk and more sci-fi kind of atmospheres. References are Neil Young, Bon Iver and Vangelis “Blade Runner soundtrack”
The references suggest Neil Young and the Beatles, while Danish Murder also can be traced in Death Machine's sound.
