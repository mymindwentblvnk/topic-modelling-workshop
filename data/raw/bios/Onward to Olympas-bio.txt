Coming up among such North Carolina bands as BETWEEN THE BURIED AND ME, BELOVED and HE IS LEGEND gave the members of Onward To Olympas an appreciation for an array of genres.

Since their formation in 2008, OTO has meticulously cultivated their sound, blending progressive metal, straight hardcore, and elements of death metal. That the band can indulge all their musical proclivities, yet produce such consistent results, while making it seem easy is a testament to their craftsmanship.

On their new album, This World Is Not My Home, recorded with Jamie King (Between The Buried And Me, FOR TODAY) Onward To Olympas make sure to bring the intensity, effortlessly melding melodic singing with thick metal-core screams, occasionally bringing a little old school back to the table with crisp gang vocals.

The album is polished and impressive, influenced by bands such as Our Last Night and P.O.D. And with lyrics like, "you can not run, you've nowhere to hide" this album will leave you at a loss for words.  This solid debut album will be available on Facedown Records on January 19th, 2010. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Onward+To+Olympas">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
