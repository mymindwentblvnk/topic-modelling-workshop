MEGATHERIO is a Brazilian thrash metal band formed back in 1986 by: Nal (guitar/voice), Anderson (bass), Alberto (guitar/voice) and Rodrigo (drums). In 1989 this original line- up called the quits and just returned in 2007. Between the years of 1986 – 1989 the band played everywhere it was possible, always impressing the audience with their aggressive and catching songs, very inspired by bands such as: SLAYER, POSSESSED, Dorsal Atlântica, DESTRUCTION, etc. At that time they tried to fix a place in the Brazilian scene, but they were luckless and did not take the chance to record their stuff in a proper way, only a few demos and home recordings were done and spread around. Anyway, it was enough to make the band name alive until nowadays. In 1989 the original line-up split-up and Anderson found new members to continue the band, they did few new songs but without success, the band found an end. In February of 2007 the original line-up had a reunion, they started practicing in a studio, the old songs were dig and few weeks later they had the complete set from ready! Some concerts were done and finally the decided to record everything in a very professional way. The result is their first full-length album released on Cd on May of 2009 by ABSURD RECORDS.
