There are two bands named Cherusker:

1) A R.A.C. band from Germany (Active).

2) A one man's Pagan Black Metal band from Germany (Split-up).
After quitting Cherusker, Mandragora later joined German black metal-band "The True Armageddon" as a vocalist, but was kicked out again after a few years. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cherusker">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
