Eresis is a French progressive metal band from Paris with a five-member lineup, founded in 2007. "Eresis" is the Sumerian for "Queen of the stars". The band indeed shows a profound interest for ancient civilizations and their mythologies, and furthermore the resonance of these myths in our contemporary society and inside human relationships. Recurrent themes in the songs are the duality of the human soul with respect to morality, ambivalence in relationships, and destructive mechanisms consuming our civilization. Eresis pours these themes in their lyrics in a metaphorical way, sometimes freely inspired by the literature.

Musically, the band tries to aggregate a wide range of different musical and vocal styles in a hybrid way, making "heavy" use of the many influences brought by each group member. Common influences include bands like Opeth, Dream Theater, Pain of Salvation, Ayreon. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Eresis">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
