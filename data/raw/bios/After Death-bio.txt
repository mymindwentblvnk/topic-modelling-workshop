After Death have been together since 1999 with many different lineups. Mike Browning (ex Morbid Angel, Nocturnus and Acheron) vocalist and drummer is the Axle of The Wheel of After Death. The idea behind this entity is to convey my Occult learnings to the public via my Musick, and like life, After Death is an open book always changing page to page. If you view my history in the Musickal work that I have done, a Path can clearly be seen through my lyrics of my Occult studies and progress. In 2006 after a 2 year hiatus After Death is back more brutal than ever with a whole new lineup! And a new demo called Secret Lords of The Star Chamber Below. It contains 4 all new songs with more intensity and atmosphere than any of the previous incarnations! For a complete Bio and Discography go to www.afterdeath666.com (page is down now <--- edited)
