The Menzingers originally formed after the dissolution of Bob And The Sagets, a band local to the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre area of Pennsylvania. With the addition of Greg Barnett the band recorded a demo/self-released album "A Lesson In The Abuse Of Information Technology" in 2006.

Shortly thereafter they were signed by Go-Kart Records and re-recorded the songs from "A Lesson" and re-released their album with the addition of some new tracks.

At the Fest VII in Gainesville, FL they were approached by Brendan Kelly of The Lawrence Arms and subsequently signed to Red Scare Industries.

They released their Red Scare debut EP "Hold On, Dodge" in 2009. 

In April 2010,  Chamberlain Waits was released, through Red Scare Records. In March and April they also toured in support of Against Me!.

On May 17, 2011 they announced that they had signed to Epitaph Records. Brett Gurewitz, founder of Epitaph Records and guitarist of Bad Religion said this about the signing of the band:
"These guys play the kind of pure punk rock that I grew up with. They are seriously talented songwriters and I'm happy to welcome them to the Epitaph family. I think the band is a great fit here." 

They released their third full length album, On The Impossible Past, on February 21, 2012 via Epitaph Records.

The band currently lives in South Philadelphia, PA.
