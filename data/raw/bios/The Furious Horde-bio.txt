The Furious Horde are a Dark Symphonic Metal band from Essex, England, formed around October in 2003.

A first Demo was recorded in November 2004. A song was recorded for the "Shards" compilation in 2005.

Their first album "World Aghast" was first worked on at the end of 2005, and was due for a March launch in 2006. However, after the majority of the album was recorded, the studio was moved to Jigga Jam Studios, and the decicion was made to re-record all the tracks.
A "World Aghast 06" is in existence as a cd-r EP with the older versions of the tracks. The newly recorded "World Aghast" 07 is the full album and was released by October of 2007. Limited to 100 copies.

The band has had a great deal of interest from smaller labels, but they claim to be waiting for a larger one to take notice.
They have had a song on the cover cd to a "Terrorizer" Issue (world wide extreme metal magazine). And have played alongside bands such as Korvus, Interlock, and shows organised by members of Cradle of Filth. They were also voted in the top 10 best unsigned metal acts on ukmetalunderground.com

In 2011, The Horde have returned, with their new ep Instigation. The World will once again bare witness to this Dark Majesty....
