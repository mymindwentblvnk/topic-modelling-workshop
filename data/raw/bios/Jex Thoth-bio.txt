Jex Thoth is a psychedelic rock / doom metal band formed in 2007, currently based in Madison, USA. The band originally took shape under the name Totem. After issuing an EP with that moniker, the group rechristened itself Jex Thoth after the band's female frontwoman and vocalist. Jex Thoth take their cues from the metallic strains of Black Sabbath and the retro experimentalism of Amon Düül II. 

Jex Thoth was initially a collaboration between Jessica Bowen and ex-husband songwriter James Jackson Toth, leader of the experimental psych-folk outfit Wooden Wand. Like Wooden Wand the band initially favored stage names (Jex Thoth aka Jessica Bowen, Grim Jim aka James Jackson Toth, Silas Paine aka Glenn Donaldson from The Skygreen Leopards, Zodiac aka Clay Ruby, and, later, Johnny Dee aka Nick Johnson. Frontwoman Jessica Bowen and drummer Nick Johnson are the only remaining original members. Since then, the band has featured a rotating cast of Madison musicians, including Brandon Newhouse and Matt Jacobs. 

Jex Thoth debuted in 2008 with a self-titled album of thudding, psychedelic acid rock featuring mythological lyrics and riff-laden hooks. Blood Moon Rise, released in June 2013, is a much different, dreamier affair than its full-length predecessor. Produced by renowned Seattle producer Randall Dunn, Blood Moon Rise is more polished and gently wandering than riff-driven, showing as much pop as metal influence. Bowen's remarkable vocals are a mainstay, however, and remain the central appeal of the band.
