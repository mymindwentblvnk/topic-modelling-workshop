Some claim Robot Monster Army to be one of the most overlooked & under-rated Hard Rock/Heavy Metal bands of the late 1970's, releasing 3 solid, if not groundbreaking, records between 1978 and 1980, touring with several of the era's heavy hitters, and even cracking the UK Top 100 with their 1979 single "No Big Deal". Operating in the shadows of 70's arena monsters like Aerosmith, Blue Oyster Cult, and Kiss, the group recorded and toured incessantly yet never broke nationally, and today are largely forgotten, a footnote in the Hard Rock history books. Almost as if they never existed at all. 

Others would have you believe that Robot Monster Army is a studio project put together in 2007, the brainchild of Bob Mayo, former bassist/vocalist of Boston's thrash metal pioneers Wargasm. Mayo allegedly conceived Robot Monster Army as a tribute to the classic rock & metal of the 2nd half of the 1970's, and wrote and recorded the material with the sound and feel of this era in mind. The project supposedly also provided Mayo with an excuse to make music with some old friends with similar musical tastes; members of Meliah Rage, Only Living Witness, Steel Assassin, Bad Karma, Temporary Insanity, Triphammer, Formicide, Gang Green, Tongue n Groove, and the rest of Wargasm all are rumored to have contributed to the project. 

Regardless of which version of the facts is true, shelve Robot Monster Army's music in your mind somewhere between Rainbow and Rush.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Robot+Monster+Army">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
