3.Solid Ground is fusion / progressive rock / grunge / jazz band from Montenegro. It was grounded 2006, when Ivan Pejović (bass) and Nikola Vicković (drumms) started the musical cooperation. After some time Andrija Pejović (guitar/vocal) enters, bringing his ideas which formed nearly simmilar expression as this one that exists today. Great influence on sound and on songs came also from people who were part of the band in some particular phases. They began recording their first album 2010, and at the very end of whole things Strahinja Kovačević (trumpet/keyboards) joined the band. It turned out that he was the missing part along with Tamara Brajović (vocal) that joined several months later. Recording of album ‘Open Silence’ was finished in april 2013. https://solidground-me.bandcamp.com/
