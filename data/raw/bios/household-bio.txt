2.) Since the summer of 2005, Central Scotland has homed a four-piece band called "Household". Their tunes are driven by tight dynamic drum n' bass, sometimes-noisy-sometimes sweet guitar lines, lo-fi keyboard & synth, analogue tape loops and urgent-yey-catchy vocals.

Household decided to part ways and played one last gig on 22nd October 2007.
Chris and Rob now play together in a band called plaaydoh. Chris plays guitar whilst Rob plays drums.
