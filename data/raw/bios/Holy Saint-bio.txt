Holy Saint was a melodic heavy metal band at times bordering on power metal. Formed in Rochester, NY in 1986. Holy Saint stuck around for nearly a decade even though they were never afforded the opportunity to record for a proper label. Towards the end of their existence the band moved to Nashville, TN and changed their name a couple times. They released 1 demo "Sound the Alarm" in 1987 and a full length "Holy Saint" in 1990 , which was re-released in 2005.
