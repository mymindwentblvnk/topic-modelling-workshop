Dutch black metal band, formerly known as Inverted Pentagram.

From the primefounders of Inverted Pentagram: Consanguineus (bass/drums/backing vox), Insane (guitar), Necromaster (drums) & .S:O:L.Necrosadist (chaos vox) only .S:O:L.Necrosadist has remained. Many line-up changes plagued us through the dark past years. With these changing line-ups we created the foundations of songs like Winter../Journey Through the Necropolis/In The Space of One Moon. In 1994 Necromaster was replaced by D.Dreessen behind the drum-kit. Consanguineus was replaced by G.v.d.Schoor on bass/synthesizer-bass. With this tri-force we remained vast and permanent and created new songs and revisioned the old ones. Again line-up changes occured so D.Dreessen took the keyboards preside and G.v.d.Schoor took all guitar parts preside.
