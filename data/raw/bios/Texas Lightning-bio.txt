Texas Lightning is a German quintet from Hamburg which fits in the country music genre and describes itself as old fashioned and hip. Their music is a mix of country and pop drawing from country classic stars like Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Johnny Cash and Tammy Wynette and pop stars such as ABBA, Nancy Sinatra, Linda Ronstadt, Madonna, Michael Jackson and the Beatles done with a bit of country humor. The band members are Olli Dittrich as Ringofire (drums and vocals), Jon Flemming Olsen as The Flame (vocals and guitar), Markus Schmidt as Fastfinger (electric guitar and banjo), Uwe Frenzel as Friendly (doublebass and vocals) and Australian Jane Comerford (vocals and ukulele). The band's first performance took place on December 23, 2000, in the music club "Knust" in Hamburg although there have been a few changes in the lineup of the band since then. A review in FolkWorld Magazine Europe by Stephen Thanabalan details how the band are symbolic of the rejuvenation of Euro Country Music that whilst nascent in countries like Germany are still yet to become mainstream with Eastern Europe and even parts of Western Europe, and thus depends on interest from the cradle of country music, the USA, for interest and support.Last presented on Eurovision 2006 in Greece(Athens) as Germany group with their song "No no never!".They were putted on Eurovision 2006 Final comptetion directly without semi-final voting. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Texas+Lightning">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
