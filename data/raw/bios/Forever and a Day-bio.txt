FAAD was a rockin 5 piece, and later a rockin 4 piece. The band formed from the ashes of a long gone FL punk band, Last Minute. Half of the band formed hardcore mega band Poison the Well, while the others formed FAAD. FAAD began their career with an EP on Eulogy and a tour up the east with KEEPSAKE. After close to a year of touring, the band decided to shake things up. Guitarist Mike Crigler took over vocal duties on the Eulogy full length. The band matured from a poppy emo band to a more elaborate group, focusing more on songwriting and less on image. FAAD is for fans of Piebald, Chamberlain, and the Get Up Kids. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Forever+and+a+Day">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
