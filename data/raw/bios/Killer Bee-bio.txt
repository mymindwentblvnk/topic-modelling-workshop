Killer Bee is an independent 23-year-old hip-hop producer from New York/New Jersey. He has produced for many up-and-coming artists like Lonny X, dylAn, JuegoTheNinety, $emaj Roc, Krewe of 77, Hassan El Hobo, Justah Phase, and more. He draws influence from producers like Kanye West, knxwledge, Flying Lotus, J. Dilla, Shlohmo, HitBoy, Boi-1da, 40, Nujabes, skywlkr, bsd.u, SwuM and many more. Bee incorporates many genres into his music: lofi hip hop, dream hop, electronica, vaporwave, and blends them to create a wholly unique sound that at first sounds reminiscent of 90s hip-hop but its dreamy samples and cutting edge drum sequences make it sound futuristic, allowing Bee to innovate and push the boundary of the hip-hop genre. He has been featured on prominent blogs such as Tiny Mix Tapes, EARMILK and The Juice Daily, and recently graduated from Colby College with a degree in Economics. He has released a beat tape, an EP entitled ‘Venus’, a full length album entitled ‘alone_’, and most recently an album ‘Otaku’, which was released under Grifo Tapes and is available to stream/download on his soundcloud and bandcamp.
