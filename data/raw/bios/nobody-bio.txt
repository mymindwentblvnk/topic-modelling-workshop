There are multiple artists sharing the name Nobody:

1) Italian one-man neofolk project of Stefano Di Felice.

2) Nobody (Elvin Estela), has been a fixture in the Los Angeles music scene since the early 1990s, first as a producer for many of the premier emcees at the Good Life Cafe/Project Blowed, and then as a remixer, producer, and important member of the global electronic and indie-rock communities. He has worked with, remixed, and toured in support of the Postal Service, Prefuse 73, The Mars Volta, Aceyalone, Mia Doi Todd, and many others. His releases for Ubiquity and Plug Research have garnered him not only critical praise, but the clout to define and redefine his sound as he sees fit. His productions effortlessly flow from the hip-hop themes of his early career to the psychadelia and rock motifs of his most recent work, and his vast musical vocabulary allows him to deliver with each and every mix.

Nobody has recently collaborated with singer Niki Randa to form Blank Blue.

3) Nobody is also a progressive metal/rock band based in the United Kingdom. Their aim is to create "intelligent, meaningful music for the people of the world to listen to". Born in 2012, they have only released an EP called The Reflection. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nobody">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
