Bob Holroyd is one of the UK's leading exponents of ambient/global fusion/chillout music who to date has released 4 albums, including the critically acclaimed ' A Different Space ' and ' Without Within '. His work has been licenced extensively for tv, films, and numerous compilations, and been remixed by various DJs including Coldcut, Francois K, Romanthany, dZihan and Kamien, and Loop Guru.

Always hard to catagorise, Bob's music includes influences from extensive travels in Africa and Asia, and ranges from intense walls of percussive drumming - as on his cult club classic ' African Drug ' - to delicate atmospheric soundscapes, such as the beautiful ' Looking Back ' - a track recorded for the ' Sanscapes ' project to highlight the plight of the Kalahari Bushmen.
