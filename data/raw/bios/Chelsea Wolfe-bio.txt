Chelsea Joy Wolfe (born November 14, 1983 in Roseville, California, U.S.) is an American singer/songwriter and eponymous full band started in 2009 out of Los Angeles, California Her style has been described as "doom folk" and her music has been described as "a specific brand of drone-metal-art-folk."

Chelsea Joy Wolfe was born in Roseville, California, and grew up in Sacramento. She is of Norwegian and German descent. Her father was in a country band and owned a home studio. By the age of 7, she had written her first poem and by the age of 9, she had written and recorded songs which she later described as "basically Casio-based gothy R&B songs."

Inspired by the dark state of the world and the strange connection between all things, she creates a unique musical blend of goth-folk, experimental rock and spiritual realm funeral songs. With influences ranging from the great minds of Ingmar Bergman and David Lynch to Soviet and end-times literature, her songs conjure visions of other dimensions, claustrophobic echo-rooms and parking garage cathedrals.
