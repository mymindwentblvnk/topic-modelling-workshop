2. PandaParty (disbanded) were a death metal band that changed their name to Fed to the Forest in 2007. First and foremost, PandaParty was NEVER meant to be a joke. We are a fast-paced, solid death metal/progressive band from Winston-Salem that loves to share beefy riffs with the ears of the public. PandaParty is trying to bring a fresh new type of technicality to the front. We shoot legendary two-step beats with classic riffs to make your feet move, add some grind, some old school deathmetal, and harmonized melodies. We ARE different than most of the generic bands that come along. Diversity plays a big role in our songs. Difference is what is driving us down the path.........come join us.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Panda+Party">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
