Lithuria is a brutal death metal band hailing from Helsinki, Finland. It was year 2005 when drummer Perttu Kurttila founded a brutal death metal band with singer Jesse Ronimus. They recruited Jose Valli and Kride Lahti to play the guitars and so Lithuria was born. After only few line-up changes the band has found its near final form and sound at the end of June 2006. Jarno Kolehmainen vocals, Kride Lahti guitar, Antti Poutanen bass and Perttu Kurttila drums, composed the line-up which was going to take the band forward. With this ensemble Lithuria played a handful of gigs, mainly in the Helsinki capital area. At spring 2007 Lithuria also recorded an EP called "World Ending Pestilence".

Later Tuomas Yli-Jaskari joined the group as a live session player. Soon afterwards, when Kride Lahti needed to leave the band due to schedule conflicts, Tuomas Yli-Jaskari took his place as a full band member in autumn 2007.

Lithuria started active playing and rehearsing again after having a small time-out in the beginning of 2008. Great opportunity for the band was opened in spring 2009 when Lithuria signed a record deal with Finnish Redhouse FMP. Just before the recordings for the debut album started Niko Kalliojärvi joined the band as a second vocalist and guitarist.

In summer 2010 the debut album "Pimps Of The Living Dead" was finished. Now Lithuria is looking forward to play a lot of gigs and making the world suffer for its negligence to heed the word of the brutal groove.
