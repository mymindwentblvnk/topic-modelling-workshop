Norinian hails from Haarlem, the Netherlands and describe their music as 'industrialized urban black metal'.

Norinian was founded on the threshold of the new millennium by A. Kramm and Tsasil to channel the self-inflicted isolation and feelings of misanthropy of the individual in mass, urban society. Originally playing all the instruments themselves several songs were written and recorded, yet no demos were released to the public.

In 2005 two of the songs, recorded over the years ,’Treacherous’ and ‘The Sinner’, were released on the ‘D.E.S.O.L.A.T.E.D.’ demo. Even though the demo was limited to a small number of copies both tracks quickly emerged on a number of foreign websites, receiving praise from listeners spread out from Europe to Japan. After the release Norinian became inactive for quite some time, both members focusing on diverse solo projects.

Over two years had passed when A. Kramm and Tsasil were both asked to participate in an unrelated electronic project. Now that they had rekindled their cooperation, inspiration for new material eventually resurfaced as well. With the recruitment of Përvertor on bass Norinian was reformed with an even colder and more industrial sound. This lead to the recording of the 2008 demo ‘Absent Seizure’, featuring an updated version of ‘Sinner’, three new tracks; ‘Cacotopian Masses’, ‘Skin:Machine’, and ‘Sanity’s Void’ and a lengthy industrial intro titled ‘Reaktor’.
