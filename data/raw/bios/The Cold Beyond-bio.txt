Formed in 1998 out of the ashes of Nightworld and Paradox, The Cold Beyond (originally known as Dead By Morning) is the most violent, and hateful black metal band to rise from the Milwaukee extreme metal scene. Hailed for their ferocious and devastating live assaults, The Cold Beyond, ravaged the first two March Metal Meltdowns and 1999's Milwaukee Metalfest.  The band released two very well received demos, a highly sought after rehearsal and a single for A Technological Cure. From 2001-2003, Asylum continued alone and released a demo and a solo record titled, 'Deathbed Revelation' under the Cold Beyond name, before moving on to engage in other musical battles.  This album was considerably different from previous assaults and was more akin to industrial black metal in the vein of Thorns.  

Thus the first savage chapter of terrible tragedy came to an end and The Cold Beyond was laid to rest.  In mid-2010, after many years of frozen silence, Sithicus, has crawled out from the grave to summon the Cold Beyond horde to battle once more. Thus a new grim chapter of utter desolation and somber reflection now begins... Uncompromising, elite, and still unequaled. This is grim, ugly, apocalyptic, Black Metal the way it was meant to be played. 

On October 27th, 2012 The Cold Beyond made their official return to the live warfield as well by releasing their first material in nine years, namely the new EP, 'Forever Burning' on Nightworld Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/the+Cold+Beyond">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
