Future Is Tomorrow (F.I.T.) is an italian power/progressive metal band created in 2003, by an idea of the guitar player Michael (Gadjet) and the drummer Fabio (Grave).

The intent was to create an heavy metal band where the sound could space out from the unflinching riffs and the choirs of Savatage and the feeling on prog-power of Symphony X.

Soon Davide as singer and Matteo (Field) as bass player join the band, and after a week comes to complete the quintet also Paolo (Pablic), as second axe.

F.I.T. focus their attention to the production of own songs and after six months they record the first Demo at Remaster Studios in Vicenza.

During August 2004 Davide decide to leave the band because of musical differencies.

So it starts the search of a new voice and a couple of months later F.I.T. make Massimo (Max) acquaintance, singer coming from Quinto di Treviso. He, also, was Elvenking's singer in the Wyrd album, under the nickname Kleid.

Thanks to his arrival the band can begin the recordings of an EP of six pieces, entirely self-produced, which sees the light on the first days of June 2005.

Future is Tomorrow begin to support this EP with a lot of gigs in Italy and a mini tour of a week in Barcelona (Spain). At the same time the band starts to work to his first full-length album, a big concept about death in society, with a male choir singing in the whole disc.

During March 2007 F.I.T. enter the Luigi Stefaniniâ€™s New Sin Studios to record the album which sees the light in September of the same year. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Future+Is+Tomorrow">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
