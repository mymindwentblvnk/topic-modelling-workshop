Formed in New Jersey in 2003 by Ko,  C.J.,  Otto and  P.S.R., Broken Soul is a turbulent metal band with progressive insight, alternative temperament, and gothic afflictions.  A deep onslaught of 7 and 8 string guitar rhythms, depraved solos, bastardized time signatures, and macabre lyrics are the group's specialty.  The songs reflect on the lascivious side of human nature.  Obsession, addiction, betrayal, and revenge are pervasive topics that are delivered with the wanton anguish of a repentant sinner.
