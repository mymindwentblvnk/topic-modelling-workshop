1. Korrigan is a Atmospheric Black/Death metal band, located in Patras, Greece.

Initially formed in late 2005 by Nikos (drums), Panos (Guitar), Kostas (Guitar) and Vaggelis (Vocals), Marios (bass) had joined the band by summer of 2006. It was nearly after 7 months that Manolis (Keyboards) was invited to become a member of Korrigan. A month later Zoe entered the band, contributing with her ethereal voice to the bands evolution. With this line- up Korrigan set off to record their first demo entitled "Korrigan", self-released in February 2008. In September 2009 there was a new drummer (Antreas) for Korrigan as well as a new member Stefanos(violin).

Through all this time Korrigan performed several lives in their hometown supporting bands like Septic Flesh and Nightrage as well as co-organizing other live events with fellow bands. Just before beginning the recordings of their debut album Antreas(drums) was replaced by Panagiotis (drums) and Marios (bass) by Giannis (bass).

In 2010 they released their second demo, "Promo 2010" and shortly there after they released their first full-length, "Thy Art, Lament, which also featured the two tracks from the 2010 demo.
