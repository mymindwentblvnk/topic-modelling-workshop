Alarm Will Sound is a U.S. twenty-member contemporary-music chamber orchestra.

Members of the ensemble began playing together while studying at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York, and have diverse experience in composition, improvisation, jazz, popular styles, early music, and various traditional musics from around the world.

Alarm Will Sound's repertoire ranges from European to American works, from the arch-modernist to the pop-influenced. The group has worked with contemporary composers, premiering pieces by Steve Reich, John Adams, Roberto Carnevale, David Lang, Anthony Gatto, Cenk Erg√ºn, Aaron Jay Kernis, Michael Gordon, Augusta Read Thomas, Stefan Freund, and Wolfgang Rihm.

From 2004 to 2007, they were musical artists-in-residence at Dickinson College.
