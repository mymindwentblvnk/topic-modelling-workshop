Comprising of Josh White & Matt Lowe, Hybrid Minds represent a new musical force with their melodic, soulful Drum and Bass already making waves. A synergy between influences including trip-hop, acoustic, soul and RnB, Hybrid Minds draw on a myriad of influences to produce the smooth sound they are now known for. 

Although an innovative force in Liquid Drum and Bass, Matt & Josh are no strangers to bass music & had ran a record label together for many years which focused on the more dancefloor orientated side of the genre. 

However, after drifting towards the more melodic side of Drum and Bass, They decided to use their talent to make some smoother collaborations. After only a few joint efforts, Hybrid Minds immediately shot to the forefront of the Liquid scene, with many household names playing tracks from the newly formed duo. Their method of bouncing ideas off each other in the studio yielded immediate results with one of their first tracks ‘The Place’, becoming one of the biggest tracks of 2011. This track features some of the elements that now make up Hybrid Minds’ distinctive, soulful sound. 

Since then, this fresh new two piece have gone from strength to strength, with their smooth, melodic brand of Liquid gaining them releases on some of the most respected labels on the scene. After huge hits including the stunning Lost EP on Audioporn which received over half a million views on UKF, the follow up Heartfelt EP on Austrian label Mainframe, a remix for Jakwob’s ‘Blinding’ and a string of singles on Spearhead, Allsorts and Fokuz, Hybrid Minds have become synonymous with the best Liquid DnB.
