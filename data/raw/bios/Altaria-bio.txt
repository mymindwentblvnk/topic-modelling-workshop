Altaria is a power metal band from Finland. They have released four full-length albums on the record label Metal Heaven.

In January 2008, the band decided to part ways with their record label Metal Heaven for undisclosed reasons. They are currently searching for a new record deal. Songs for a new album have been written which had originally been planned for release in late 2007; as soon a new contract with a record company is signed, work on the planned release will continue.

In the same month, bass player Marko Pukkila parted ways with the band after a disagreement concerning the split with Metal Heaven. His replacement is Ex-Terrowheel bass player and current Alteria vocalist Marco Lupenero. This means that the only original member still active with Altaria is Tony Smedjebacka.

Altaria have toured with the likes of Nightwish and Sonata Arctica.
