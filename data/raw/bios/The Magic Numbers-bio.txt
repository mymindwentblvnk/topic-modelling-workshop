The Magic Numbers are a four piece indie band from Ealing, London. The band consists of two brother-and-sister pairs, Romeo Stodart (guitar, lead vocals) and his sister Michele Stodart (bass, vocals), and Sean Gannon (drums) and his sister Angela Gannon (percussion, melodica, vocals), who came together as a band after Romeo and Sean started writing songs together. While the Gannons are of Irish heritage, the Stodarts are the children of a Scottish father and a Portuguese mother and were born in Trinidad in the Caribbean and raised in New York, before moving to London in the mid-1990s.

The band are currently signed to Heavenly Records, and their self-titled debut album was released on 13 June 2005. Singles from that album have included  Forever Lost, Love Me Like You, Love's A Game and I See You, You See Me. Later on that year they recorded a new song, Gone are the Days, used on the War Child charity album Help! A Day in the Life 

In 2005 they supported Athlete, Doves, and Brian Wilson, and played the Glastonbury Festival to a fantastic reception. August saw the band play at the dual-venue V Festival in Chelmsford and Staffordshire and Leicester's Summer Sundae.

The band have since released their second album, Those The Brokes in November 2006, and the Undecided EP in September 2007. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Magic+Numbers">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
