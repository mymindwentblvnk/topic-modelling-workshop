Look for a release announcement soon!

According to the band's official MySpace page (www.myspace.com/horrorofhorrorsdeathmetal)
they are re-releasing the first two CDs through Thrash Corner records remastered with a new cover and packaging in early 2011. That tittle is BLOOD, FANGS & FOULNESS; THE COMPLETE CURSED CHRONICLES. This release will include two bonus never released brand new  songs from the upcoming full length.
