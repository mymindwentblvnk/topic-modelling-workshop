Setting out to reinstate the original philosophy of industrial, Human Tragedy is a fusion of Art, Anarchy, Philosophy and all things occulted (even things we have seen happen, then immediately blinded ourselves to). Beleiving Man should strive to be better than the animal you beleive we've descended from, They want to show you the nauseating side of Humanity, and all the odd ball shit we can get ourselves entangled within. But viewers seem to be in short supply, so the course has been strongly changed, focused now more on acquiring samples, and doing what they do.

Arising from Missoula, Montana, currently dwelling in the Abyssmal Pit, the Great Cesspool (definition 2), The Richy Bitch playground, Bozeman, Montana. The Absolute epitome of White Stereotype. *shudders* They say they "feel smothered within the conservative-progressive, schizophrenic atmosphere."

Human Tragedy, a 1-man supergroup, got "organized" upon the acquisition of a laptop in early-2006, a slew of crap followed, (Mostly rap & Hip Hop beats) until the unfortunate immolation of said machine in a freak fire that destroyed 1 room of a TRAILER. 1 room. Work did not grind to a halt, however. It continued on for the next 2 years between Missoula Public Library and Mansfield Computer Hall at U of M, with the majority of "XIII: Birth & Death" composed on public terminals.

Early 2008 seen the arrival of B.E.R.T.H.A. 4.0, whereupon "911" composed, and the first foray into rap music (but thats a sad story for another time). B.E.R.T.H.A. served her capacity well, ultimately replaced by B.E.R.T.H.A. 5.0, a bigger, stronger, faster type of electromania. 

Long gaps of inactivity are hallmark of this artist, usually due to catastrophic system failures involving B.E.R.T.H.A. X.0, such as the most recent, removing a good 10 tracks unpublished. Do you know of a good data recovery program?
