Nafrat is a brutal death metal band from Singapore and was born in the summer of 2003.

The original line-up consisted of Nazak (Vocals), Sahail (Guitars), Naar (Guitars), Zadgaroth (Bass) and Jahannam(Drums).

The band went on to record their first demo called "Chaos Unleashed" in early 2005. It received positive reactions across the South East Asian underground scene. 

Late June 2005,  Saraph joined as their new bassist. After a few months with the band, Saraph left the band without a note, but the issue was resolved a few weeks later.

The second demo came in November 2005 when they released the demo "Invoking The Masses". 

Nafrat released their first full-length album entitled "Through Imminent Visions" in June 2008. 

In December 2008, Nazak had to leave the band in December 2008 to fully utilize his time for family and career. He was replaced by Sethra as the new vocalist.
