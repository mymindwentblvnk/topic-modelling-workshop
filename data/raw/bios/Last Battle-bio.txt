The group Last Battle has been founded in 2006 by its frontman Blyashuk Anatoly. Inspired by creativity of such groups, as Holy Blood, Immortal Souls, Antestor, Crimson Moonlight, Anatoly has started to pray for creation of his own group. In August, 2007 was recorded debut album "Through Thorns to Stars". In a recording of the album Fedor Buzilevich (frontman of Holy Blood) took active part. In March, 2008 the first membership of the band has been collected, but after several rehearsals for some reasons Anatoly has stopped cooperation with these musicians and group has again returned to the status of the studio project, led by its frontman and unique participant Blyashuk Anatoly. In September of the same year Maxim Ryansky, the founder of black metal project Dying Blaze, has joined Anatoly, and the strengthened studio work has begun. In April, 2009 the album "Through Thorns to Stars" has been rewritten that was favorably displayed on quality of record and arrangements. At once they began to work on the second "The Way Home." In August, 2009 Masha Kapustenko has joined group and has occupied a place of the bass guitarist, and in October of the same year the album "The Way Home" has been completely written down and shown. The debut concert has taken place in Armageddon Metal Church.
