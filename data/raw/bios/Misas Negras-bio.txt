Misas Negras which means "Black Mass" in Spanish is a Crossover Thrash Metal Punk Hardcore Band. Created by the Cazares Brother, Carlos & Ømar. Carlos ventured one Summer Break from School and wanted to create a Project about some controversial things in his life at the moment, including events of the past decade mainly Political and Religious. Therefore all the imagery on this page represents so. The Cazares Brothers acquired Pedro Gallardo on Guitar, a local Ivanhoe Wastelander. The Black Mass Demo consists of 10 Songs recorded and written in one Summer. We intend on releasing another Demo next Summer 2010 of far better quality and might perform live.
