Emetic Death, originally called Carnophage formed in Burbank California in early 2003 by Tyler Marsh and Joshua Brown. After many lineups Tyler left the band in 2004 to pursue other musical opportunities. Alex Purvis auditioned and took over on guitar, and Alex and Josh decided to change the name of the band to Emetic Death. A month later Matt Snyder joined Emetic Death on the drums and the lineup was complete.

In February 2005 Emetic Death went to World Champ Recordings and recorded Blood Spilling E.P. The four tracks to go on were: Blatant Butchery, Dead Amongst Living, Blood Spilling Slaughter, and Reluctant Discharge.

On June 7th 2005 Alex Purvis died in a tragic accident in the Azuza Canyon River in San Gabriel Mountains California. Alex was from Monrovia, CA and was 26 years old. He carries on through his daughter and through the music he left behind. After the loss of Alex, Josh joined the Marine Corps and Emetic Death was put on an indefinite hold.

Now five years later, Josh is coming back to California to reignite Emetic Death and will release a brutal full length CD in 2011! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Emetic+Death">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
