Astral Silence is a one-man metal project of Quaoar.

The "band" was formed in 2008 in Switzerland and signed to Kunsthauch record label.
Quaoar has recorded and relased a split with De Silence Et d'Ombre and Aton in 2009 and also his debut album entitled Astral Journey in 2010.
Astral Silence creates atmospheric black metal with dark ambient sound and down-tempo.

On the Astral Journey album the music is heavy and agresive, there are emotions, misanthropy, blackness...but in a different way.
Astral Silence will bring you in the open space full of emotions and deep thoughts about questions which ever search for answers. Great atmosphere for dreamers and seekers of the unknown!
