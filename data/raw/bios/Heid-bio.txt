Heid was a martial / dark ambient project from Sweden, started by Kristian Olsson and Tolufim in 1997 (originally under the name Gimla).
While in the process of making their first album, two more members joined: Peter "Parasoleil" Lindahl and Stefan Östlund. With "Submitting to the Uprush of the Unconscious", released on Bastet Recordings, the new formation created a dark, dystopian sound, that rendered them a formidable reputation among fans and scene press alike.

After the release of their debut album, Heid signed to Malignant Records, but Stefan Östlund left the project.

Their second album, titled "Arktogäa", took over a year in making. It contains a more structured, mathematical approach composition-wise, and came to incorporate new elements, like musique concrète and ethno-tinged passages.

After the release of "Arktogäa", Tolufim left the project. Kristian Olsson and Peter Lindahl had plans to continue, but Heid dissolved definitely in July 2001.
Cold Meat Industry released a CD retrospective titled "Pilgrim of the Sublunary World" in 2002.

Heid's legacy is carried on in Survival Unit and L.E.A.K., two projects that opted to focus on different facets of what Heid comprised. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Heid">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
