Maryland-based rapper Brandon Perry, known as Knowledge Above All Nonsense (abbreviated to K.A.A.N), is best known for his cynical, twisted tracks and fast bars. His music is heavily influenced by the abuse he has experienced, including substances, his musical idols growing up, his depression and anxiety, and his struggle to grow his fan-base. K.A.A.N is not one to use simple language – his vocabulary is far larger than that of other rappers around and he flaunts it within his tracks often.

I like the expressionistic part of music. Like how you can say the craziest thoughts, feelings, and emotions inside of you, put it in over instruments, put it out—and then you find there are people that feel exactly the same as you do. I spend all of my free time writing or recording.

He is best known for his songs “Mary Jane”, “Lonely” and “KAANCEPTS.” All of these songs were all produced and recorded in mid to late 2015, except “Mary Jane,” which was released in June 2016, and “KAANCEPTS”, a remix of Dr. Dre’s “Deep Cover”. All three tracks feature the fast bars, pessimistic perspective and huge vocabulary common to most of his music.

"I work best when I’m just left alone, so I’m always isolated without any real human interaction, so its cool that I can be cut off from the world, but still be able to express my self and the way I feel."

K.A.A.N. has currently released 9 albums and 5 mixtapes. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/K.A.A.N.">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
