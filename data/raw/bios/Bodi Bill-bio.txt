Bodi Bill bring the heart & soul back to Berlin.

Bodi Bill love. Bodi Bill are loved. Bodi Bill do not cry, they take action. They do not think about it, they just create. Norway, Iceland, Germany and Denmark all discovered the sound of these three Berliners more or less on their own. No subtle marketing strategy. No artificial online hype. Only passion.

Passion for their music.
Passion for their self created fashion.
Passion for their autarkic way of working.

In a time of chill, of electronics and calculus Bodi Bill enter the stage with an alternative draft. They inspire with pop songs full of love and devotion, backed up by a heartly coolness only a city like Berlin can bear. This coolness is burst when 3000 voices sing together on their live shows: "If you don?t like Sonic Youth ... fuck off and die!?

The three of Bodi Bill grew up in the Berlin, Germany underground scene, as part of post rock bands, as part of the club and dj scene. WMF, Berghain, Melt! - this is Bodi Bill's world now. Plus one of the most forcefully expressive voices you can find these days in the european underground. Fabian Fenk. But just listen, all flowers of speech would be misleading, they would not live up to the expectations.

Not only on the occassion of J.D. Salinger's Death "I like Holden Caulfield? is the band's first life sign. Passionate songwriting, unobstructed indulgence, virtuosic beats, Kraftwerk-like synthie layers. Allways refining their already unique sound.

Pop songs to show the sated that they are still hungry. In this spirit the album at hand collects the essential moments of the band's hitherto existing work and will tell everyone who did not know so far of this fantastic band. Two In One
