The Voices and Organs project is headed by Per Lindmark from Sweden. Per and friends craft sonic textures and dramatic melodies reminiscent of Sigur Rós or Múm, but more intimate and more focused on songwriting. Many of the tracks consist of several distinct parts seamlessly sewn together, as the group very consciously tells their stories sonically, melodically, and lyrically. Orphanage is the debut Voices and Organs album, released on Western Vinyl in 2006. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Voices+and+Organs">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
