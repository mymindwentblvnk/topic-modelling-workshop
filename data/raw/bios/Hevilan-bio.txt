Formed in 2005, Hevilan is a metal band forged on the passion that their members have for the style of music that they play. The band’s characteristic sound was born on the riffs of guitar player Johnny Moraes, which had the idea of assembling a heavy rock group that could use the compositions that he had been working on for some years. Looking only for professional musicians with degrees on music, that had heavy metal music as their main style, Johnny found on bass player Biek Yohaitus the right talent for his creations. In addition to entering the band, Yohaitus also brought his college mate, drummer João Gobo, and vocalist Alex Pasqualle, that had worked previously with him on another group called Sinrise. Alex surely had the right qualities to take on the role of frontman in Hevilan. Still in 2005, the band makes some auditions to gather a second guitar player, and through a mutual friend they find Ricky Lucas, that soon joins the band. With the desire to record their first official demo EP; at the end of the same year, the group begins the production of their first work, which was produced and recorded by Chris Szankowski, a friend of the band, at his home studio. In April 2006, recordings of the album are finished with three tracks completed: Blinded Faith, Distant Tomorrow and Quest of Illusion, and, in the following month, the band goes to famous Creative Studio in São Paulo, for the mixing/mastering of the demo. Since then, Hevilan is preparing the official release of their first EP, which is going to take place on September 2006, and many shows are to be followed. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hevilan">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
