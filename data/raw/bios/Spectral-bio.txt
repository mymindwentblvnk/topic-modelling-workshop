There are apparently four Spectral(s).

On the picture is Spectral, the german underground band, founded in 1995. They play Metal with Black, Power and Viking Metal elements/ influences.
They haven't signed to a label yet, but it looks like they have a good chance of getting one. At the moment, they are working for their fourth album, which will be a continuation of Dawn Of Gods.

The second Spectral (alias Moog), formed by Jean Loup Kehrig, in collaboration with Thierry Gotti, has been producing music since 94, released by different record labels in Europe.
They released the album "Diffuse" on December 2000 with Blueroom / Emelt / EFA for Europe, and Equinox / Techno Flux for Japan and Asia.
This album is going into different musical directions, from ambient / downtempo to bigbeat and electro funk, with a touch of the particular groovy techno / trance that characterize their sound.
Spectral has done many gigs since 1994 for different kinds of events, parties and festivals around the world. They are now projecting their gigs dates for the next months to play live the new tracks and album project.

The third Spectral is an underground Romanian Tehnical Death Metal band who released a demo in 2007 named Autopsy of Hope.

The fourth Spectral released the UK hardcore / breakbeat track "Touch Somebody" on Cue Records in 1992 which was later remixed by DJ Seduction. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Spectral">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
