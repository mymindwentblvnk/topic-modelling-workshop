The Ancient Void is Geoff Uhal and Robert O'Riley.  Formed in Marietta, GA, we've been writing music together for a decade and a half.  Maintaining a unique two-piece format in order to keep their ideas and styles as pure as possible, Robert is the lead and rhythm guitar player and Geoff is the rhythm guitarist, vocalist, and drummer.  Stylistically, we bridge the gaps between the old style heavy metal with classical music, Scandinavian black metal, American death metal, and thrash.  Instead of being genre snobs, we believe that elements from each different kind of music can add to the experience.  We explore themes that run the gamut of human emotional experience, believing that people appreciate music they can relate to more than the average reprocessed drivel that mainstream media produces today, and we want to reach out to our fans and let them share in the experience with us.  We want them to know that we understand how they feel, and we want to embody it in our music.  Our music can be categorized as extreme, but we have thought provoking lyrics and well-crafted songs that surpass the usual “speed before skill” mentality often associated with extreme music.  We try to make the songs abrasive enough to be meaningful, but also bearable enough on the ear that its music the listener wants to hear.  Our purpose, direction, and motivation from the beginning have been quality music true to our roots and substantial personal involvement in getting our music to our fans.  We have no delusional dreams of super-stardom; we prefer to make our music approachable in a community of like-minded people. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Ancient+Void">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
