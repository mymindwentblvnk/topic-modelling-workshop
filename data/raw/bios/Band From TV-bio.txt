Band From TV is a charity cover band since 2006, whose members are all actors from American television series, who donate the proceeds of their performances and recordings to the charities of their choice.

Greg Grunberg had the idea for Band From TV after a performance at a House of Blues with several other celebrities garnered a surprising amount of fan interest. Grunberg made several connections that he would later bring together for Band From TV: he appeared on an episode of House ("Sex Kills") starring actor and musician Hugh Laurie as well as performing at a separate charity event with James Denton and Bob Guiney.

Band From TV made their debut at the 58th Primetime Emmy Awards TV Guide afterparty and as of 2007 plays high-paying charity concerts as well as performing for studio albums; Band From TV contributed a song You Can't Always Get What You Want to the Various Artists: House, M.D. Original TV Soundtrack, as well as releasing their own album: Hoggin' All the Covers (recorded in July 2007).
