Fear Disorder was signed and released one album called "In a Rage". It was released in 27 countries throughout Europe and the U.K. in 1997. That band opened for Rob Halford's old band, Fight and also Voivod.

Fear Disorder was an angry Toronto-area band that released its album independently, got signed with Revolver in England (In a Rage re-released) and soon after split up. John Fenton had replaced McMullen before the end. Fear Disorder had the opportunity to open for Fight and VoiVod. Skull was a touring guitarist for Killer Dwarfs and Goodfellas features Honeymoon Suite's Brett Carrigan. Sandman is, of course, a cover band.
