Bulp is an alter ego of Samo Å tefanec, young electronic music producer, whose work represents a blend of melodic lines, punchy rhythms, melancholic and positive themes. He organically connects sounds from diverse sources and musical instruments with his own singing and the velvet voice of his sister, vocalist Jana Salvi.
