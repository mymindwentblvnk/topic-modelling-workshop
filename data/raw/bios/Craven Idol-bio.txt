Cultivated in the subterranean lairs of England’s capital, Craven Idol is a coven sworn to the cause of the elder dead. In 2006 the fraternity of S. Vrath (Scythian) and J. Scourger (Deceptor) spawned three hymns of godless savagery in the form of a self-released demo tape. Heavily indebted to cults such as Destroyer 666, Poison (Ger), Absu and early Bathory, this debut offering’s original fifty incarnations were quickly devoured by adherents of bestial black/thrash metal. Starlight Temple Society subsequently fanned this early flame with a tape re-release.

Now the seals have been broken once more, and four newly crafted chalices are ready to be raised in libation to the shades of forsaken deities. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Craven+Idol">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
