There is more than one band called Sudden.

1. Sudden (also known as suddenspace) is a downtempo/ambient dub group from Toronto Canada. 

Members: Paul Edwards, Aaron Farr, Mark Stewart, Chris Sellors, and Ron Starfield

Being born in Scotland, emigrating to Windsor, Canada and then settling in Toronto, has certain advantages if you are an electronic musician...
First, Windsor has the unique feature of being located just 2 minutes by car across a narrow river from Detroit, Michigan, the city where one of electronic music's most important movements began. The early sounds of seminal techno music broadcast from Detroit radio stations, was easily received by the radio of a young Paul Edwards, the founding member of Sudden. Meanwhile, Paul's cousin back in Scotland was sending him mixtapes via airmail of the exploding underground UK music scene...

Eventually moving to Toronto, Paul by chance bumped into a childhood friend from Windsor, Mark Stewart. Mark was working as an engineer at the Canadian Broadcasting Company which naturally led to a shared enthusiasm to explore the limits and possibilites of the studio-as-instrument ethos.

Sudden's live performances have included gigs at Edgefest in Toronto, where Sudden mixed live to bewildered Nickelback fans, an opening slot for techno legends Orbital that won over the audience, and an invitation to return 'home' [in a sense] when Carl Craig invited Sudden to perform at the 2nd Detroit Electronic Music Festival.

Sudden have just released an album that collects the best of the now out-of-print 12" singles that highlight Sudden's downtempo and ambient work entitled "Magnitude". Available online everywhere from Spiral Recordings
