Hailing from Vancouver BC, Canada, Old Man Canyon is a band that originated from the effort of front man Jett Pace, who managed to update folk and indie-pop influences (think Iron and Wine, Mumford and Sons) to the electric format, not unlike the work of seminal folk-rock pioneers, including the legendary Neil Young and what he created with his Crazy Horse project. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Old+Man+Canyon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
