Bachelor is the new project from Melina Duterte (Jay Som) and Ellen Kempner (Palehound). It began in 2017 when Duterte and Kempner met in a Sacramento green room, after having been mutual fans of each other for years. A year later, Kempner visited Duterte’s home studio in Los Angeles to mess around and record for fun. They hadn’t hung out much since the two shows they did in 2017, but kept in touch by texting and replying to Instagram posts. Now together in LA, the two spent a few hours writing and recording their first song together, “Sand Angel.”

In January of 2020, the duo packed the entirety of Duterte’s recording equipment into two cars and headed to a rental house in Topanga, CA where over the course of two weeks, they wrote and recorded their debut album Doomin’ Sun. The house had a living room with a baby grand piano in it which they turned into a live room by pushing all the furniture against the walls and setting up drums and amps. About halfway through their stay, Buck Meek and James Krivchenia of Big Thief came by the house. Meek brought pedals and an old Martin acoustic to lend to the project, and Krivchenia tracked drums while Duterte’s partner Annie Truscott (Chastity Belt) recorded strings. Aside from those contributions, Kempner and Duterte spent most of their time in isolation.
