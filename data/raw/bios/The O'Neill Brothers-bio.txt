The O'Neill Brothers have released over 30 CDs of beautiful instrumental piano music, and sold almost two million copies – all without being associated with a major record label. Along the way, they’ve written and performed music for HBO (including music for “Sex and the City”), NBC, PBS, ESPN, ShopNBC and CBS (including a recent episode of “Cold Case”). Several of their CD collections have hit the Billboard charts, their wedding music collections are top sellers on Amazon and The Knot, and their PBS special featuring Deborah Gibson was nominated for an Emmy award.
