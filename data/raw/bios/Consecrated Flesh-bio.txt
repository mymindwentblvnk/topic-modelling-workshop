A Lancashire based quartet, Consecrated Flesh is a project that has taken much time and planning to come to fruition. With influences that range from bands like Immortal and 1349 to Rush and Pink Floyd, this particular brand of metal will excite those with a liking for extreme speed, melancholic melodies, and intense riffing. The guitar duo Andrew Shackleton and Will Anderson’s aggressive guitar parts, bassist Rory Bettany’s smooth rhythms and Max Mcleod’s thunderous drumming create the crushing sound that is Consecrated Flesh. In 2009 they released their debut E.P entitled "Invocation." This combined dark atmospheres with fast paced agression to create a pummeling sonic assult. With a young and promising line up, and an ever expanding armoury of songs, Consecrated Flesh aims to make its mark in times soon to come. 


The E.P. is available from the band for £3+ postage... or you could just come to one of our gigs and buy it there.
