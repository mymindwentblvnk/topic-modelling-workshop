For the Uninitiated Acolyte: Out of Kaos in the fire of 2004 came the bastard Titan Exordium Mors. Through many trials of blood and flame, this entity is now possesed of the souls of Black Mortum, Santi, Scourge, Matt and Hayden.

2006 saw the coming of the Serva Ad Mors EP cast by Stigmartyr Records and in 2010 Verus Hostis - A Hymn To Fire was execrated by Legion Of Death Records. Fast paced, intense yet dynamic black death which bares the stench of Hell, Leather, Bullets, Spikes and Heavy Metal is the plague spread by their conquest.

Exordium Mors will enforce this relentlessly upon the ones who dare resist. This is only the beginning and there is no end in sight... The fetters have been broken, the yoke relinquished...

Hail Prometheus! Hail the Adversary!
