Hailing from the lands of such legends as Demigod and Abohrrence comes the latest killing machine in Finnish death metal, Bloodsoul!

Influenced on one hand by the early sounds of Scandinavian death metal and the dirty, rotten sounds of Venom and Motorhead on the other! The two bitter fruits of this tree remain the main ingredients to what is known as Bloodsoul!

Bloodsoul signed in 2009 to Australian label Asphyxiate Recordings for two releases. They will re-issue officiall "Ancient Evil" which has been re-recorded in the studio along with a new track and a cover of Metal Thrashing Mad by Anthrax!!
