Fragma, or the Fragma Project are a German house/trance group comprising four members. Founded in 1998 by brothers Dirk and Marco Duderstadt, they produced their first single Toca Me with experienced producer Ramon Zenker. When it was released the following year it topped several dance charts around the world, and reached number 11 in the UK charts.

In 2000, a mash-up was produced, taking the music of Fragma's Toca Me and placing the vocals from Coco's I Need A Miracle over the top and renamed Toca's Miracle which gained further attention from DJs Pete Tong and Judge Jules. As Fragma and Coco were on the same record label at the time (Positiva), an official release was made, and went straight to number 1 in the UK charts, as well as in Australia and Ireland.

In 2001, an album was released; Toca, as well as two other singles; Everytime You Need Me (UK #3 hit), which featured vocals by Maria Rubia, and You Are Alive (UK #4 hit) with vocals by Damae.

2002 saw Dirk and Marco set up their own studio, called Evergreen-Terrace.

In 2002, Fragma were permanently operating with vocalist Damae, and have released a second album; Embrace, with hit singles such as Say That You're Here (UK #25 hit), Embrace Me, Man In The Moon and Time And Time Again.

Dirk and Marco are also currently working as a duo under their surname Duderstadt. So far two singles have been released under this name; Sunrise and Taking Over. A third single, Mahananda is expected to be released soon.

The latest release by Duderstadt is Smile, for which they worked with Anita Kelsey. Remixes were provided by the likes of Alex M.O.R.P.H. and Duende.
