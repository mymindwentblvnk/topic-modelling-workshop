Tarvas is a five-piece folk metal band from Jyväskylä, Finland.

Tarvas was founded by Otto and Jere in early 2009. Soon they gathered Arttu, Iiro and Jesse in their new band. The first band practice was at Otto's barn in February.

"Demo 2009" was recorded and released in early 2009. The quality was quite shitty, so all the old songs and a couple of new ones were recorded for "Kostoretki EP", which was released in April 2010

Summer 2010 was spent writing new songs. In September Jesse left the band, and Aarne came to play bass. Tarvas hit the studio in November 2010 to record their second EP, titled "Rajan Taa". The EP was released in April 2011.
