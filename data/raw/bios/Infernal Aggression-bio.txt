Originally formed in 1992 in the heart of Bucktown as Infernal Aggression (later changed to just "Infernal"), they were a local New Orleans area Thrash/Metalcore band consisting of the members Andre Karst on Vocals & Guitars, Eddie Clevenger on Guitar, Joey Badeaux on Bass, and Jason Turner on Drums.

Going through many line-up changes and evolving their sound over the years, Infernal Aggression built a reputation and a decent following over the years.

Unlike other bands who were jumping on the Seattle Grunge bandwagon and later on the Nu-Metal movement, they did what they loved and didn't care about what anyone thought about it.

With the last line up of Andre Karst on Vocals & Guitar, Jesse Dover on Bass, and Peppy Ruiz on Drums & Backing Vocals, they finally disbanded in 2000.

Infernal Aggression releases:

Demo: "Inner Conflict" in 1993

Album: "Born Against" in 1997

Album: "Herding The Sheep" in 1999.
