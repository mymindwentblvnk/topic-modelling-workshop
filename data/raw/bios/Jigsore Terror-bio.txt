JIGSORE TERROR was formed in year 2001 by Tobbe "Six Feet" Ander, (Scams, Smooth & Greedy, Leukemia) on guitar and Adde Mitroulis (Birdflesh, General Surgery, Sayyadina) on drums.
Very soon bassplayer Hampus Klang (Birdflesh, Bullet, Hypnosia) and vocalist Tobbe Eng (Thunderdog) joined the band.

The reason to start this project was to play some kind of old-school death metal in the veins of the early, brutal bands like Repulsion, Death, and Terrorizer.
The band made several songs and played some shows. In october 2002 they decided to record their first demo in Soundlab Studios. Six songs were recorded and the demo was sent to some labels.

A deal was signed in 2004 with LISTENABLE. The first album was also recorded in Soundlab by Mieszko Talarczyk (Nasum, Genocide Superstars).
Before the recording vocalist Tobbe Eng left the band due to lack of time. So Adde recorded the vocals on the album. The album is entitled "World end Carnage".

Tobbe "Six Feet" Ander -guitar
