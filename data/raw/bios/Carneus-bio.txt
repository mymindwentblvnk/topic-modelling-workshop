Carneus was formed in October 2003. Before that, Jonas, Viktor and Magnus played in another band named Reliqua (R.i.p), but wanted to play faster and harder music. Arvid and Viktor began talking about starting a new band that played the music they really wanted to play: death metal. As both Jonas and Magnus played in the old band and also had the passion for death metal, they joined the new band.

After just some months of existence, the first gig was a fact. After that it has just went on. The first recording disappeared due to technical problems. But later in 2004 the demo was re-recorded, named "Heaven is painted in gore" and were released in about 40 copies (we're not really sure). New songs came up pretty quick and the recording of the second demo "Hate Incarnated" started. Hate Incarnated were released in the summer 2005. This demo took Carneus to another level. A faster, harder, more technical sound. Hate Incarnated have got great reviews and Carneus were more inspired to write new music than ever.

Now, Carneus third demo entitled: 'Carrier of Diseases', is finished!! 5 new brutal songs, here to torture you ears. This time it even harder and more intense than on Hate Incarnated.

Carneus is now working on a bunch of new songs... <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Carneus">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
