DAMNAS are a UK band, based in London, formed in 2003.

They recorded their only release -a self titled EP - in 2008 but disbanded before they could record a full length album in late 2010

Refusing to be another 'Toxic - green' thrash band, DAMNAS built a reputation for writing songs that were blisteringly fast live, with vocals that were almost spat like an MC, with hard hitting lyrics about real life (not zombies, beer, etc etc), and were subsequently dubbed 'Street-Thrash' by some.

Played shows with some mighty stonking bands:

Tankard
Kataklysm
Sabbat
Extreme Noise Terror
Mutant
Cloven Hoof
Gama Bomb

Some reviews:

"...the energetic guitarists' seem to bounce off each other as they exchange tight, punchy riffs like trading cards, applying an edge of brutality and mixing it up with a smattering of hardcore punk aggression..." - Metal Team UK 

"...they hit the stage running and absolutely tore the place apart..." - Campaign for Real Metal 

"...Damnas are up next, and they put 100% into their breakneck full-force thrash, which makes for a lively and entertaining performance!..." - Zero Tolerance
