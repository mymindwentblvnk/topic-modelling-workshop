Originally known ‘round Nashville as “Ring Of Fire,” Raging Fire changed their name when it conflicted with another band. These roots-rockers blazed a trail across the South East circuit like Sherman duck-walking through Atlanta in the mid-1980s. Fronted by the fiery Melora Zaner and driven by Michael Godsey’s wildneck guitar, which channeled Link Wray’s six-string mojo every night, Raging Fire quickly earned a national rep for their excitable live show. They coulda been big, they woulda been big, they shoulda been big – Raging Fire walked the walk with a sound that mixed Buddy Holly pop with X’s punk fervor and Hank’s lonesome heart. 

The band is currently in the process of digitalizing material from their classic EP, Family Thing (released by Pristine Records) and Faith Love Was Made Of (released by Neo Records).
