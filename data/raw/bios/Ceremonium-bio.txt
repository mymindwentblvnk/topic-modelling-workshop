Ceremonium emerged in the autumn of 1992. The first shadows were cast in 1993 with their "Nightfall in Heaven" 7'' quickly followed by their s/t demotape. These two recordings of dark death paved the way into new depths of atmosphere. Ceremonium then channeled their own emotions into the recording of their debut CD "Into the Autumn Shade" during spring 1995. It got released the same year in late summer  on Fadeless records, which was the first release of the label. 

"No Longer Silent", Ceremonium's second effort in the year 2000, an atmospheric blend of death, black and doom metal, was followed by their 2001 Promotape. In 2003, the band was put on hold because member, Brandon Diaz, was receiving medical treatment for his cancer.

The band has spliten up. In 2012 however, a compilation album called "Days We Have Written" spawning all of their material, including an older version of "Under The Eternal Horizon" (2001 Promotape), which was released on the "Visions Of The Macabre Vol. 1" compilation in 1998, has been released by Weird Truth Productions.

That ends the rise and fall of one of the most underrated and yet most supreme death/doom metal bands. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ceremonium">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
