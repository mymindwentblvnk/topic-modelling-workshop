An excellent Double Bass, Piano and Guitar player, Rob Sparx has been writing and DJing dance music since the late 90s. Robs first release in Jan 2004 "Rob the Builder - Can you fix it", was the start of a wave of drum n bass releases on Twisted Individual's label's Grid, Zombie and Up Yours. Rob has also released DNB on Formation records (DJ SS), Propaganda (Generation Dub), Vibez (Subject13) and label/distributor Z-Audio. Never one to be pigeonholed Rob soon experimented with other genres producing breaks, house/electro, trance and dubstep most of which was released by labels associated with Z-Audio. 2007 Rob decided he was going to concentrate mainly writing dubstep as he knew a few of the scene's key players from growing up near Croydon and loved the creative freedom of dubstep that other genres lack.

Owing to the diverse range of music he produces Robs tunes have been played by a wide selection of DJ's including: Zane Lowe, Joe Ransom, Skream, Distance, Benga, Darkside, TRG, N-Type, Scientist, Walsh, Rusko, Tes La Rok, Sukh Knight, Grooverider, Bryan G, Bailey, Dieselboy, LDouble, Marky, Nicky Blackmarket, Flyte, Ash Attack, James Zabelia, Nick Warren, Anthony Pappa, Laurent Garnier, Colin Dale, Gabriel Ananda, Quivver and 10Sui! Robs tunes have featured on stations including Radio 1, 1XTRA (Mary Anne Hobbs show), KissFM, RinseFM and Ministry Radio. Artists Rob has worked with include Distance, Cyrus (Random Trio), Reso, TRG, El-B, Tunnidge (Deep Medi), Synkro, Radikal Guru, Bar9, Nero, Subject13, Phantasy & Shodan, Twisted Individual, Zen, Sharooz, Tom Pooks, Pablo Bolivar and Mike Foyle (Armada).
