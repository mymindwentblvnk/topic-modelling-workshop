It all began late in the year 2001 after Furia (Ben's former melodic black metal band) had deceised once and for all. Ben started to look for suitable members for a new band.
In the early 2002 a guitar player Kari and a drummer Tony joined in and rehearsing began.
Later in the year the band recorded a rehearsal demo "Supreme Hate". 
At this point the band was still missing a bass player which slowed down the process until Jouni (bass) joined the band.
The band was rehearsing a lot and few new songs were written. 

In the autumn 2006 Coprolith started recording their first official release, demo-cd World Falls Down, when suddenly Kari left the band due to his interests on other things. 
The demo-cd was still finally released in december 2006 but the band had no chance to perform live without another guitar player.

In the year 2007 the new guitarist J-P was found and Aleksi took over the drummers throne. First live performances were made.

In the year 2008 the band played many gigs and released an Ep called "Death Only". On september J-P decided to depart and was soon replaced with another excellent guitarist Kuli. First mini tour as a support took over on october with Pantheon I (Nor) and Enochian Crescent (Fin). 
On december the band entered the studio once again and recorded 3 new songs for promo.  

Coprolith has got loads of new songs and is more than ready to spread its message world wide!
Death, hate and grief!!!
The future remains to be seen...
