NOT US was a band based on Barcelona, members from local band like Icebend, Abono Pa la Tierra, Black Kiss Superstar, Pulse Of Dawn, Ayvala... joined in that project because they needed to express themselves in a wild band.

Band Members: Primo Zon, Quico Tretze, Blon, Zaak, Guri, DJ Allbert, Tomy, DJ Kone

Strongly inspired by band like Rage Against the Machine, System of a Down, Fantomas, Korn, Tomahawk... They mixed all kinds of music freely.

Their live shows were explosions of energy.
