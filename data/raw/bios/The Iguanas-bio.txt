There have been several bands with this name.

1) Perhaps the best-known was a garage rock band formed in 1963 in Ann Arbor, Michigan whose drummer was later to become Iggy Pop, who later left to form The Stooges. They had a minor hit with "Again & Again".

2) At least one more American 1960s garage band with the name The Iguanas, presumably from Baytown, Texas. Unlike the better-known Iguanas, they had a single released during their existence.

3) The Iguanas from New Orleans, Louisiana, formed in 1989. Their music reflects the local mix of Latin/Caribeño rhythms and themes with distinctive NOLA jazz and R&B elements and a dash of Chicano rock. Since about 2000, their lineup has consisted of Joe Cabral (vocals, sax, bajo sexto, guitar, organ, percussion), Rod Hodges (vocals, guitar, accordion, lap steel), René Coman (bass, piano, organ, guitar, mellotron, background vocals, tambourine), and Doug Garrison (drums & percussion). The Iguanas have earned a loyal fanbase in New Orleans and beyond on the strength of buoyant live shows and a string of melodic studio albums. Their intelligent lyrics are sung in both English and Spanish, but it's their eclectic range of styles and musical textures that keep them both fresh and difficult to categorize. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Iguanas">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
