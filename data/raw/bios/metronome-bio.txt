1. Metronome (メトロノーム) is a Japanese band which is often described as Techno-punk, and that takes its influence from many genres, including techno, rock, hardcore and pop. They have also been described as gamewave and nintendocore. Their songs typically sample video game, or video game inspired, sounds and while being based in rock, are heavily electronic as well. They have a total of 22 official releases, albums and singles. Metronome is an indie band based in Tokyo with a small but loyal fanbase, along with scattered fans overseas.

Metronome's claim to fame is that they travelled from the future—The year 2005, to be exact. Because they were getting bad record sales in 2005, they decided to travel back in time to 1998, thus boosting sales via their "futuristic" sound and look.

In a 2007 interview, Talbo-1 Fukusuke mentioned how they stopped with saying they were from the year 2005 as said year neared. The band apparently had thought they wouldn't still be around by the time 2005 rolled around.

2. Metronome was a pop-rock group centred around the songwriting of brothers Steve and Phil Macauley.  They formed in 1976 to provide music for a school play in Nottingham and then started gigging thereafter.  The Macauley Brothers retired to the corporate world at the end of the 1970s while alumni pursued alternative music, notably as members of the nascent  Dark Star .
