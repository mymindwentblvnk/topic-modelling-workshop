The Magic City Hippies began as a one-man band playing for the co-ed party scene on the streets of Miami -- serenading the 20-somethings with a mix of old-school hip-hop covers and original tunes.

After months of stealing electricity and stirring up crowds of passers-by with his loop-based setup, frontman Robby Hunter was asked by the Coconut Grove Police to cease and desist or 'play in a real bar.'  Finding sanctuary in a nearby dive bar, Robby enlisted the support of multi-instrumentalists Pat Howard and John Coughlin for a regular gig.

This trio dubbed itself Robby Hunter Band and released a self-produced, widely acclaimed debut LP in 2013 entitled Magic City Hippies, which included the beachy Hype Machine #1 Hit "Corazón" alongside major blog hits "Hard On Me" and "BUST” and album cuts that can be heard on episodes of major network shows like The CW’s “iZombie” and Showtime’s “Ray Donovan.”

Encouraged by the international reach and positive reception of their debut, they decided to expand their sound and approach under the new moniker Magic City Hippies (after the title of their debut LP).  In July of 2015, the Magic City Hippies released the Hippie Castle EP, and the lead-off track "Fanfare" hit #1 on Spotify's Global Viral Top 50 in the US, UK, and Canada.  It has since accumulated over 1.9 million streams.

The single ’HUSH' is the Hippies' latest handiwork, the first piece of a new full length album planned for release in summer 2016 amidst a string of upcoming US tour dates. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Magic+City+Hippies">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
