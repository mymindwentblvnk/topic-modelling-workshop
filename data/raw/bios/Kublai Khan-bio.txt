2 different bands with this name:

1) Energetic, aggressive, in your face music with no regret. a four piece metalcore/groove metal band based in the Texoma area. We say whats on our hearts to express how we feel, who we are, what we stand for, and wont stand for, as well as the problems of our generation. In hopes of tapping into the underground and revealing the unseen lives and feelings of the youth in modern American society. We are fighting to make an impact in a music scape bogged down with meaningless lyrics and recycled with mindless music. Trying to push our own messages of anti-racsim, building up the young American heart, struggles with depression and addiction as well as the familiar feeling of losing people you hold close. We out here to use our music to relate with everyone on a personal level.
