FIFTH REASON is dark progressive metal band formed in Stockholm, Sweden in the middle of 1992 by Simon Johansson (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, MEMORY GARDEN, STEEL ATTACK) and Nicklas Oreland , one year after they recorded a promotion demo called "STRANDED". This tape was mostly used for labels and some magazines. But as Simon became a member of the Leif Edling project Abstract Algebra Fifth Reason was put on hold for at least a year.

Simon never let the idea of Fifth Reason die , so when the split of Abstract Algebra became a fact (even though he actually joined force with Memory Garden , the later half of 1996 ) he had a chat with Kristian Andr√®n (BLOODBOUND, TAD MOROSE, MEMENTO MORI, MEDUZA, WUTHERING HEIGHTS ) about reforming Fifth Reason. Martin Larsson and Oscar Tillman also joined the band. 
Early 1997 the foursome got a record deal with the swedish metal label Heathendoom records.
There was only one problem to solve, the band needed a second guitarist. But after a chat with Marco A. Nicosia.(HEXENHAUS) that problem was solved.

Simon asked one of his closest friends Mike Wead (also the guitarist of MERYFUL FATE, KING DIAMOND, ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, HEXENHAUS, WITCH, CANDLEMASS, MANYNNIA BLADE, KRYPTILLUSION) to produce the album which he would be glad to do.The band stepped into Studio 22 together with Mike and recorded album ,entitled "PSYCHOTIC". The second album was released four years later, in 2001. The second album entitled "WITHIN OR WITHOUT" was released by SPV. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fifth+Reason">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
