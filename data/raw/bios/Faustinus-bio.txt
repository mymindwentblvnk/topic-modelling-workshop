BIO:

Faustinus was founded in summer 2006 by Jaroslav Lukáč (solo guitar) and Viktor Matejka (drums). They met in local music bar, where Jaro had played with older professional musicians. Viktor used to have death-metal band Amorbital, so he invited his friend and former colleague Ľubo Stanko (vocals and guitars). Guys started to rehearse, but they still missed the bass guitar. After one year they finally found next member and the band was joined by Juraj Nosál (bass guitar). Since that moment Faustinus has been complete and has started to work on 100 percent. At the beginning the band was playing cover songs from Arch enemy, Hypocrisy, Children of bodom and lots of others, but later it began to compose its own songs. After a few months the band had five complete songs and decided to create first demo – Dream designer. Now the band is looking for its chance in the world of metal music and would like to do music professionaly. The band has a lot of new material and is composing other songs. After a few months was created new demo called Symbiont. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Faustinus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
