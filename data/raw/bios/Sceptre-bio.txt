There are two bands named "Sceptre"


1)1980's thrash band who after releasing one demo changed their name to Agent Steel



2) Is a four-member Rock band from Mumbai who believe in playing music thats heavy and thrashy. Having developed a formidable reputation with their live shows they have always been crowd pullers. These guys been on the local metal scene for nearly 6 years now.  They've have been going strong ever since

Their music slips most comfortably into the thrash-metal genre.  Music-wise Sceptre are an angry bunch and their lyrics are a dead giveaway. There’s angst and there’s aggression, there’s rebellion and there’s revolution. Disillusionment giving way to verbal attack, all a backlash at the cesspool that is "the system"! 
OR To put it plainly, its Teemeer, writing (read ranting) about all the dirt under the carpet. Very  punk-ish themes combined with super-fast riffs. This might be one of the reasons why they warm up to the metal-loving crowds instantly. 

The Single "Lost Empire" was featured on the Deep Throat CD released by Throatlatch records. 
Another single "Nuclear" was on the FOK album a compilation of songs by Mumbai bands by Hangar Records.
"Revolution" was featured on FOK-3 by Hangar Records. 

Their hot sellin self-titled EP containing 4 songs has made an impact on the underground rock scene and currently the band is workin on new original material for their forthcomin album. 

In 2008 Sceptre released their album Now or Never and received critical acclaim. The album is dubbed a landmark in Indian Metal. Now or Never has 11 songs.
