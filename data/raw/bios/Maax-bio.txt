Down on gasolene alley Satan rides a Harley,Hell is a flickering neon beacon,and heavy metal banshees in broken stilettos prowl among the street gangs,this concrete ghetto is Maax's domain. Snared in the whiplash of guitarists Brett Schlagel and Kyle Kreiders hook and riff laden visions and concepts of Black & Roll absolution-Tim Green vomits barbed vocal over Jeff Browns napalm spattered battery while Bassist Jeremy Starkey pukes mangled low end and tattooed grooves. Maax are uncensored,unapolagetic,unrestrained,undisputed heavy fucking metal kings. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Maax">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
