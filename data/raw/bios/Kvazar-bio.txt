This Norvegian band KVAZAR is formed by five members from 23 to 27 years old. They play 70'ties prog with a modern sound accompanied with cello parts, tortured guitar riffs, a lot of vivid, moog, synth, Rhodes 73. KVAZAR's music is powerful drawing on contemporary influences in the same vein as other Scadinavian bands like ANEKDOTEN, ANGLAGARD, LANDBERK as well as seventies KING CRIMSON's influences, intimate sadness romanticism. Also Mellotron, Mandolin and saxophone are added on their forthcoming album. Expected release in June 2003.

"Kvazar" is a very promising debut, to say the least. These mid-long pieces (tracks 5, 6, 8 & 10) are a real discovery, innovative and inspired, which are in many ways close to the best examples of the genre in the 1970s. Anyway, it comes highly recommended to all the music lovers. BRILLIANT!
