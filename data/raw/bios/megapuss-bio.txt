Megapuss is a supergroup with the following members: Devendra Banhart, Gregory Rogove  (of Priestbird), Fabrizio Moretti (of The Strokes), and Noah Georgeson (member of Devendra's band and his producer). Megapuss formed as a joke between Banhart and Rogove, where they created the song titles first and wrote humorous songs based on the titles.

Their debut album "Surfing" was released October 7, 2008, and featured a few guest performances such as Aziz Ansari in the song "Duck People Duck Man." Their album was more or less critically panned and deemed too light and crude, although many appreciate it for its humor and solid songs.
