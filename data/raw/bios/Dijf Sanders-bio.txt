David Sanders is a 41 year old musician who lives in Gent. In August 2003 Dijf released a first maxi single (12‚Äù) on the label Clone/DUB from Rotterdam. What was meant to be a solo project began to expand. Together with the trumpet player Jon Birdsong (session - also known from 'Beck' - Midnight Vultures and 'Calexico') he released 'Mating season' (cd/lp) on the same label in 2004. After Jon came Benjamin Dousselaere, for contrabass and keys, to complete the indie band. In november '05 he released his second cd/lp 'to be a bob'! Dijf is a mix between bebop, swing, jazz, pop and elektro.
In 2008, "Homesick" was released on the label Noisesome.

Now, in 2010, Dijf has finished his new conceptual album "010201": an audio diary made from 31 days of field recording. The result is a strange, dark, emotional and very atmospheric sound, a trip from January 1st till 31st.
