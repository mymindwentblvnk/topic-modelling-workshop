Mirrored in Secrecy is a melancholic sounding metal band from Cologne, Germany. The Band consists of the two fulltime members David Timsit and Jeremy Iskandar and is the result of the dark-metal project “Wintersoul”, which already got some good reviews in the German “Metal Hammer” as well as in several fanzines.

Mirrored in Secrecy was founded in the late summer of 2003, to expand the stilistical possibilities of the project. Based on the roots of its predecessor, the addition of a more progressive style, consisted of emotional deepness and a more accessible songwriting, helped to advanced the own musical expression. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mirrored+In+Secrecy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
