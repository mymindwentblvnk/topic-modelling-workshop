Jemh Circs is another alias of Marc Richter, aka Black To Comm.

First release is the s/t LP, primarily working with voice samples culled from YouTube videos of modern-day Pop Music and the odd avantgarde curiosity, crafting seemingly simple loops and samples into minimal yet haunting songs, tunes, miniatures. Compared to his previous outings this is a more digital and artificial sounding affair (even when working with the human voice) while still retainining the spectral melodic quality he is known for.

Jemh Circs's albums were released through Cellule 75, which is a new label set up by Marc Richter to release Black To Comm-related music and a few select retrospective issues.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jemh+Circs">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
