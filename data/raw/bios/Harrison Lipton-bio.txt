Harrison Lipton is a modern RnB vocalist, composer and producer from the heart of New York City, NY and the suburbia of Easton, CT. He currently studies at Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, NY. Harrison has been making music since he started singing gospel in Connecticut at age 9 and grew up singing in churches around the state. A classically and jazz-trained pianist, Harrison became introduced to electronic music visionaries two years ago and began to take up producing and composing his own distinct brand of modern RnB. He has spent the past two years performing as a featured soloist in an award-winning a cappella group while also writing, recording, and honing his performance skills. 

He has collaborated with other artists such as Mister Lies and Dayspired.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Harrison+Lipton">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
