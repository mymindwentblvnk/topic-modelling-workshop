When Flowrian was 16 years old he developed an interest in electronic music. Six months later he started DJ-ing with Detroit & Minimal music. The first time Flowrian heard of Drum and Bass was back in spring 1997. From then on the artist knew he wants to see his own tunes rotate on deck. He started producing tunes and grew fond of other genres like jazz, funk, hiphop, experimental, classic, and breaks. Flowrian has been producing Liquid DnB for more than 10 years now with no intention to stop. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Flowrian">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
