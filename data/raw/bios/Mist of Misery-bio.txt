With two consecutive critically acclaimed releases – first the sophomore full
length “Absence”, followed by a mini album “Shackled of Life” – within two
years, Mist of Misery is moving towards bestowing another mini album upon
their listeners at the end of this year.
“Fields of Isolation”, the upcoming mini album, is the second chapter of a series
of two mini Eps (first one is Shackled of Life) created between the beginning of
2016 and the mid 2017 as a way to bridge the gap between “Absence” and the
upcoming new album (scheduled to be released in 2018). The EP is the very last
release of the band to feature guitarist Erik (Phlegathon). Erik took this decision
because of being busy with recording and writing for the new Hyperion album.
Mist of Misery continues walking along the route of crafty musicianship with
the inclusion of mournful keyboard passages, propped up with stunningly
prepossessing guitar melodies and smooth-running blast beats. The existence of
different layers of desolated and aggressive vocal deliveries at the same time has
magnified the epicenes of the overall atmosphere. Serene, ethereal instrumental
parts of the EP are likely to take the listeners to a transcendental realm. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mist+Of+Misery">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
