In Guardian Alien, electronic and otherworldly textures tessellate against a vast and empty expanse, space gorged on those tremendous beats, guitars that squeal and slice like the bass of Lightning Bolt, and actual bass that hovers like a dark and curious cloud. There are wall-covering shrieks and militaristic repetition, head-down breakdowns and tangential rips.  â€”Grayson Currin
