Hailing from North Carolina, Atma Weapon is ready to take over with riffs, riffs, and riffs to spare. Atma Weapon is a breath of fresh air in a time of overproduced metal. They champion their own brand of progressive music that blends classic with modern. With musical influences ranging from Metallica and Opeth to Pat Metheny and Pocupine Tree , the band is sure to engage the listener with diverse arrangements and lengthy compositions.

Over the past two years, Atma Weapon has been hard at work perfecting their sound and crafting their own niche. The band has been bursting at the seams, waiting to release their masterwork. Their album ‘Dark Tower’ includes a 30 minute title track which is comprised of six parts, along with two standalone songs. A daunting task for a debut album. Singer/ guitarist Mick Armstrong, drummer Brandon Allen, bassist Billy Guynn, and lead guitarist Cameron Johnson assure you that their take on progressive metal is both fresh and satisfyingly raw. “You will hear no sampled drums here.”, says guitarist Cameron Johnson. “We are here to show you metal music does not have to be sterile and calculated. It can be real as well”.
