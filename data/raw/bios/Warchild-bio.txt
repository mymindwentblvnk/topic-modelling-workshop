There is more then one artist group called Warchild. While the group pictured here is one that I am unable to describe, the other I will give you as much information on as I can. 

Warchild is an artist out of Atlanta, GA who's music is performed from his heart. He is lead vocalist, lead and rhythm guitar, and bass guitar on all songs in the studio along with mostly doing the drums as well. When he goes on the road for live performances he has a band that aids him. Warchild writes his own lyrics and music and for those of us that support him and have had the chance to speak with him, it is even easier to tell that he has depth to his music and strength in his dream. The songs listed on this page that are his are "Splendid Suicide", "Ash" and "Where Were You"

For more information on this Warchild, or to hear his music on a page that he personally maintains, feel free to check out his myspace page at least until things are set up for his music here as well. http://www.myspace.com/warchildone 

Also, don't hesitate to check out his Warchild Warriors group here on last.fm where we will be trying to keep people updated and where he himself might make an appearance when he has the chance.. http://www.last.fm/group/Warchild+Warriors <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/WarChild">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
