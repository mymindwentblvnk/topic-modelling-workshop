Irina Aleksandrovna Allegrova (Russian: Ирина Александровна Аллегрова) (b. January 20, 1952, Rostov-on-Don) is a popular Russian singer of Armenian descent.
Irina Allegrova was born in Rostov-on-Don in 1952. Her father Alexander Sarkisov took the last name Allegrov as a pseudonym when he was just 17 and Irina was born under the name Allegrova. She was brought up in a theatrical family with famous people who frequented their house and impressed the young girl. Irina spent her early life in Baku, Azerbaijan where she studied piano and ballet. Irina gave birth to one daughter, Lala, at a young age. She left Lala with her parents and moved to Moscow to become a singer at the age of 22.
In the early 1980s she became lead soloist in David Tukhmanov's group - ElectroClub. In the late 80's Irina met Oscar Feltsman, who gave her a chance at a solo career and later wrote several songs for Irina.
Irina's debut album "My Destined One - Suzheny/Wanderer - Strannik" was written and produced by her then neighbor and friend - Igor Nikolaev. The album, supported by the single "Wanderer" (1991-1992) became number 1 and stayed number 1 for nearly a full year.
Irina's next album was "Ugonschitsa" (1994-1995), which won a Russian Grammy (Ovatsiya) for Best Pop Female Star. She toured the United States after that album's release.
Irina began to work with Igor Krutoi, changed her hair to her natural brunette, got married, had a grandson, and bought a house on the outskirts of Moscow. Irina and Krutoi released two albums together, "I will disperse the clouds with my hands" and "Un-ending Romance" (1996, 1998).
Irina got divorced, released a healing-themed album called "Teatr" (Theater) (1999) and went on tour around the world.
In 2005, Irina began working exclusively with Aleksei Garnizov on "Po Lezviyu Lyubvi (On the razor's edge of love) trilogy". A new album was planned for release in late 2005.
Irina has since written 3 novellas about love, and created an award ceremony where she and other stars give out the 'Golden Duck' to those journalists who made up the worst lies. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/%D0%98%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B0+%D0%90%D0%BB%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
