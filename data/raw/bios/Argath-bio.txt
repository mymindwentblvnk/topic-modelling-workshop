Argath was formed in the year 1997 by Gath & W. They recorded their first demo ("Impurity and chaos") in 1999. "Impurity and chaos" was not widely spread and its very hard to find nowdays. After that, they started rehearsing for the next demo ("REMORSE"), it was never released. Then came "Argath" in 2002 what was probably their most brutal recording ever. And finally their 2 last demos "Towards the void" and "I invoke" were released in 2003. In the year 2005, Argath released their debut album: "Societatis Draconistrarum"... <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Argath">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
