There are multiple artists named "Dogon". It may also refer to the ethnic group living in Mali.

1) Dogon is an ambient / electronic group founded in Boston, United States by Paul Goodwin (USA) and Miguel Noya (Venezuela).

2) Dogon is an electro / dub duo associated with members of Psychick Warriors Ov Gaia.

3) Dogon was a death doom metal band from Perugia, Italy. They released the demo "The Ancient Land of War" in 1997.

4) DogOn is a Swiss jazz-rock/fusion trio formed by Eric Hunziker (guitar), Thomas Tavano (bass) and
Tobias Hunziker (percussion) in Zurich. The main theme of their music is described by the band as "spaceship travelling through the vast dimensions of jazz, funk and 'open music'". Debut album was released in January 2017. Meanwhile, band members have participated in various musical acts before. For example, Eric was part of several eminent Swiss projects (including Peter’s Playstation, Lobith and Fearless Five) and led their own collectives (worth to mention Neuromodulator and Swiss Indian Orchestra, in the latter of which he played Indian Sitar). Eric studied at the jazz schools in Germany and Switzerland (he was taught the guitar by Christy Doran himself, and the arrangement was taught by Lars Lindvall), and during his trip to India he took lessons from authoritative Indian performers on national string instruments in Varanasi. By the way, Eric and Tobias are not brothers or relatives, this is just a coincidence they both have last name Hunziker.

5) Dogon is a free improvisation/noise collective from Italy. They released two records on Wallace Records: "Before And After Dogon" (2002) and "Who Is Playing In The Shadow Of Whom?" (2003) . Members:
