Part 1 was a gloomy sounding punk band from the UK. The 'Pictures Of Pain' release was strangely enough released on US hardcore label Pusmort. Pushead, singer of Septic Death, famous artist, and the guy behind the Pusmort label, was very impressed by Part 1. He even included some tracks on the well known 'Cleanse The Bacteria' compilation LP. The band are interviewed in Ian Glasper's  "The Day the Country Died". Part 1 are part of a few bands like The Mob and Rudimentary Peni that had a darker take on the anarcho-leaning politics of that period of DIY Britpunk. In fact, Nick Blinko of Rudimentary Peni helped finance their first EP.
