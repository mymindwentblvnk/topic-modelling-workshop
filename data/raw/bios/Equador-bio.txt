There are 2 bands named Equador: 

1. 
Equador are Henry Binns of Zero 7 and Bo Bruce who was a finalist of ‘The Voice’ season 1 and went on to secure a successful solo career, touring worldwide and provides guest vocals for a number of electronic dance producers. 

The new Equador album meshes the songwriting talent of Bo Bruce and the familiar clarity of production associated with Zero 7. Bo Bruce's vocals and songwriting ability demonstrate a gravitas that fuses a familiarity after listening. Henry Binns interprets the vocals with ease allowing the Bo Bruce brogue to engulf the mind whilst providing a familiar musical structure. This unique combination conveys the Equador sound. 

Both artists have a strong presence in the music scene. Equador will attract Zero 7 and Bo Bruce fans but also provide a strong platform for engaging new fans and supporters.
