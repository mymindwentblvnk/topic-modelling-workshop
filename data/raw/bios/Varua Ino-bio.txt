Varua Ino was an obscure groove metal four-piece from Tahiti, French Polynesia. There's no available information about the band in the media except for their only album Scum released independently in 1997. The only official web-page is the inactive MySpace profile.

"Varua ino" means "evil spirit" in Tahitian.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Varua+Ino">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
