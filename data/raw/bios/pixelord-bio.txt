"When it comes to Russian beat science, you need to know about Pixelord" - Error Broadcast 
"Absolutely blowing my puny tunneled mind to s*^t!" - Sonic Router
￼￼
￼Moscow’s Pixelord delivers a refined, emotive melting pot of sounds that stands alone in the ever-evolving world of electronic music. Tough and touching in the same breath, Alexey ￼Devyanin is at the forefront of an ever-evolving Russian scene that many consider one of the most exciting musical developments in recent years. ￼Pixelord sits among a current wealth of producers where sound dominates over genre, ￼mashing elements of Hip Hop, Footwork, Garage and Grime together into a unique take on ￼bass music.

￼Over the past year Pixelord has released music for tastemaker labels such as Error Broadcast, Leisure System, and Hit & Hope to critical acclaim. ￼Pixelord has a reputation for playing brilliant sets live, and his recent Sonic Router mix is ￼testament to his faultless, fresh selection. He has a cult following worldwide (his 60,000 Twitter followers are evidence of this), and has been booked across the globe from China to ￼Holland. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pixelord">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
