Radiopilot are a Popband from Berlin, Germany. They formed in 2005 as 'Kimono' and won several contests, such as the 'John Lennon Talent Award'. In 2006 they changed their name to Radiopilot and started recording songs for their debut in several studios but were never fully satisfied with the results. So the band went to O.L.A.F Opal, producer of the german band 'Juli', where they finally recorded the first album 'Leben passiert' (life happens), released on 22nd August, 2008. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Radiopilot">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
