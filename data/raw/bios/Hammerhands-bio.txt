After an extended period of gestation, HAMMERHANDS commences with Old Testament wrath. Featuring ex members of The Love and Terror Cult and Dance Electric, HAMMERHANDS is realized through shifting musical paradigms, and informed by years of missteps, faltering, and grudges gone unresolved. 

HAMMERHANDS debuts with an unforgiving epic. Aptly titled as “Glaciers,” HAMMERHANDS explores the coldness of the human condition in a matter-of-fact manner. With long droning parts, mixed with slowed down crushing riffs, amongst eerie death-march beats, the record plays as a requiem mass for the ill-fated. Fearlessly crafted, this Streetsville quartet has created a bewildering companion piece to natural disaster and manmade calamity alike. 
Citing influence from musical acts such as Neurosis, Converge, The Melvins, and Sleep, HAMMERHANDS take the aggressive temperament of their contemporaries and present it in a poetically charged arrangement that is hauntingly engaging. This atmosphere translates well to their live show which is jarring and peculiar—hypnotic and apocalyptic. 

HAMMERHANDS’ intent isn’t easy to pin down, but perhaps that is the power of their essence. Sanctified by soured attitudes, a commanding presence, and a proclivity towards retribution, HAMMERHANDS is the architect of our own devastation.
