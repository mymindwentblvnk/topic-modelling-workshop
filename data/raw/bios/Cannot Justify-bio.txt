Cannot Justify seeks to present a violent revolution every time they invade the stage. Solidarity drives these six executioners to present a stage show and sound that will remain with their legions of fans and friends long after the lights go down. CNJ does not conform to the metal establishment, nor do they fall prey to the seductions of formatted hard rock. CNJ seeks to create music that creates both motion and emotion through heavy riffs, brutal grooves, and melodic choruses. Do not come to a Cannot Justify show expecting anything less than six hearts and souls being spilled on stage with the purpose of revolution through entertainment.
Cannot Justify's accomplishments have come rapidly. Less than a year after first taking the stage CNJ was crowned winner of the Jingle Jam Battle of the Bands at the Hard Rock Cafe in Minneapolis. Following that triumph they were finalists in both the Central Minnesota Battle of the Bands at The Rox in St. Cloud and the End of Summer Band Slam at The Rock in Maplewood. In addition to sharing stages throughout the dirty Midwest with talented local musicians they have also had the opportunity to open for hardcore staples Pro Pain and Sworn Enemy, as well as the legendary Primer 55.
In that same short period of time Cannot Justify has released the demos "Consume Me," and "Illness." After sharing hundreds of copies of both demos with fans and friends around the world, CNJ entered Black Apple Studios in Minneapolis, MN. With musical guidance and recording wizardry provided by Chad Helmonds, the final result "Nightmares and Dreams" is set to blow the world of music wide open. Look for a late fall, early winter release, and subsequent shows in support of this EP. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cannot+Justify">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
