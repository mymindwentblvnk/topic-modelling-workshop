Pektop is a Belgian band out of Leuven, started up in 2007 by Adriaan De Raymaeker, Ivo Rensen and Steven Eembeek. 

Coming from different musical backgrounds ranging from trash to jazz, the music transformed into a mix of slow heavy drone, psychedelic rock and heavy paced riffing. The atmosphere of the music is apocalyptical with a glint of hope. Already having shared the stage with amazing bands such as Ufomammut, Los Natas, Morkobot, Dragged Into Sunlight and many more, the band continues to innovate their repertoire and grow musically throughout the years. 

With shows through Europe already including Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Ireland, this heavy rocking trio is looking to get heard and kick some serious ass!

After the release of their first studio album in late 2010, “The Antikythera Mechanism”, the band has been working on new material and playing more gigs, currently they are writing and recording a new EP in between shows.
