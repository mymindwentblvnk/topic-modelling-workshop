The Pleased was an American alt-pop band active in San Francisco, CA, between 2002 and 2006. The band comprised 
Noah Georgeson
Richard Good
Luckey Remington
Genaro Vergoglini
Jason Clark
Joanna Newsom

Keyboardist Joanna Newsom, while known for her harp playing, is quoted as saying at the time, "I usually don't tell people about The Pleased if they know me from the harp. And if they are there to see The Pleased, I usually don't tell them about the harp. I am nervous that these people will expect something similar."

The band self-released two EPs in 2002, Never Complete and One Piece from the Middle, and in 2003, they released their debut, and only, album, Don't Make Things. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Pleased">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
