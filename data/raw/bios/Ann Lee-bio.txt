Ann Lee was born on 12-11-1972 in Sheffield, England. She went to Italy a few years ago. There, in a discotheque, she started to sing to share a laugh with some friends. She was spotted by a talent scout who invited her to an audition where they were looking for session singers and vocalists.

She passed the audition with flying colours and began doing session work. She also decided that great food and sunshine were a good reason to stay in Italy. After a while, seeing that she enjoyed singing and everybody said she had an amazing voice, she decided to start a solo career.

She went to Larry Pignagnoli, a famous producer of dance music with a long list of international hits to his name, and did a studio test on a track that Larry was working on with a young, highly talented arranger called Marco Soncini.

The result is 2 Times, one of the most extraordinarily unforgettable debut songs to come out of the international dance scene in a long while.

2 Times went to no.1 in Denmark, no.2 in United Kingdom and Belgium, Top 10 in in France, Germany, Austria, Australia, New Zealand, Italy, Netherlands, Norway and East Europe, collecting many Gold and Platinum discs.

The second single, Voices, reached top 1O positions in [palce]Spain, Denmark and the Czech Republic. It was released in United Kingdom in February 2000 and went straight into the Top 30.

The third single, an irresistible cover version of Ring My Bell came out in Europe, while 2 Times began exploding in Canada.

Ann Lee's debut album, Dreams, is currently on release and selling well all over the globe!

The fourth single, taken from the Dreams album, So Deep, gave free rein to her inimitable vocal prowess.

Now Ann Lee is back with an irresistibly catchy dance anthem No No No, just released all over the world.
