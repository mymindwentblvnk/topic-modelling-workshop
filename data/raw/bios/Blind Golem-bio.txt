Blind Golem is a new project born out of a lifelong passion for classic hard rock, with a big Hammond organ, screaming wah-wah guitars, massive choruses. The original seed comes from the tribute band Forever Heep, dedicated to the classic Uriah Heep repertoire, that played several times as a backing band for Ken Hensley himself, founding member of Heep. After several shows, the idea came to produce an album of original material in that same vein of melodic, epic and powerful hard rock and so Blind Golem was born! 

Debut album, “A dream of fantasy” is an exciting journey in that magical wonderworld first created in the seventies by bands like Magnum, Rainbow, Lucifer’s Friend and of course Uriah Heep. To add depth to the occasion, the late great Ken Hensley himself is guesting on the album, playing Hammond organ and slide guitars, for what is one of his last recorded sessions, before his untimely passing last November. 

Cover art was made by none other than the legendary Rodney Matthews, responsible for countless classic covers for bands like Thin Lizzy, Nazareth, Magnum, Diamond Head, etc. The members of Blind Golem all come from experienced bands, having released several albums with Bullfrog, Rocken Factory and Forever Deep, and played thousands of shows through the years with rock legends like Don Airey, Roger Glover, Ian Paice, Bernie Marsden.
