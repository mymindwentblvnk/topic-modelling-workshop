For the San Francisco-based Kill Rock Stars band, see The Lies

There are 4 known artists with the name Lies.

1) A hardcore/punk band from the San Francisco Bay Area formed in 2012.

2) LRoss Drummond, 21 year old Singer and writer from Aberdeen, Scotland.

3) An alternative metal band from Lyon, France. Formed in 2009, LIES has quickly found its place in the Rock-Metal scene with an original style mixing melody and power, taking its influences in many genres such as Metal, progressive music of the Seventies, electronic music, Pop music, but keeping roots in a solid and technical Rock. Their music reached a wide public in France and abroad when the band took part in an European tour with the mythical US band STUCK MOJO.

At the end of 2010, LIES and Lord Nelson (singer of STUCK MOJO) started a collaboration called "Lord Nelson Feat Lies", which led to the release of the album "Fight". The project has played some shows in France in particular with Skindred (organized by Garance Production) and in Spain, and is now preparing a tour in Europe and in the United States.

The first album of LIES was distributed by M&O Label and received a very warm welcome by criticisms as many reviews can show.

After one year searching for the right singer, LIES is now back in 2013 with its second album, signed on the Independent label SEND THE WOOD MUSIC. Some of the titles have already been played on stage during a tour with SYBREED.
This new opus provides a much more targeted style, more organic and less electronic, letting once again the priority to the melodies while keeping huge and controlled power. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lies">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
