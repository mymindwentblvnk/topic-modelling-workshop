Exremains was formed in the summer of 2007 in Helsinki, Finland by Pete Niemistö, Arto Rikkonen and Matti Fagerström. Bass player Jani Salakka joined the band shortly after that. Few months later in November second guitarist Tero Illi joined the band, and in April 2008 they recorded their debut demo Silence Will Come (demo 2008). In October 2008 Salakka was fired from the group and he was replaced by Mika Sallanen in November 2008. Shortly after Pete Niemistö decided to leave the band. Jarno Taskula (also in Evemaster) took over the screaming duties in February 2009. In July 2009 Sallanen left the band to concentrate on his other band Spirit Disease. He was quickly replaced by Jussi Saarinen. In early 2010 the band recorded their EP Choices, which was released in March 2010. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/exremains">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
