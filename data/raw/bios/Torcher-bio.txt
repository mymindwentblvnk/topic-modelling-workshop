There is more than one band with the name Torcher:

1. Torcher is a Metal band from Kitchener, Ontario, Canada.
Originally formed by Brenden Malott and David Friesen in 2006.
The two started writing songs and defining their sound with influences from Northern European metal bands, as well as North American Death and Thrash Metal bands. They then recruited Curt Williams; who has been part of previous projects, and a long time friend. After practicing for several months they seeked out Kyle Boland to play second guitar.

In a short amount of time Torcher has already been called one of the loudest bands in the Kitchener Waterloo area. They have been creating a new sound for the long lost Canadian Metal scene.

Torcher is currently recording their long awaited EP - Open Fire, and are also looking to book shows for 2009. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Torcher">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
