Quest Pistols is an Ukrainian pop band, formed from the dance ballet «Quest». They had their first performance on April 1, 2007, followed by a tour in Ukraine.

Lyrics are written by Isolde Chetha, except the song "Белая Стрекоза Любви", whose author is a young musician Nikolai Voronov. In the role of the soloists are the three members of the «Quest» ballet: Anton Savlepov (June 14, 1988), Konstantin Borovsky (February 14, 1981) and Nikita Goryuk (September 23, 1985). Boroski left the band in 2011 to be closer to his then pregnant wife. He trained his replacement, Daniel. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Quest+Pistols">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
