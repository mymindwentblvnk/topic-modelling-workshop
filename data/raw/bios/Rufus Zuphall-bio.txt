Out of Aachen (a stone throw from Belgium and Holland) this superb band have often been called Germany's answer to JETHRO TULL. Their two studio albums are highly sought by collectors and this is no wonder. Both have been reissued on Cd but "Weiss Der Teufel" was still very rare. Apparently a second CD edition exists with live tracks as bonus. Also exist a four-disc box set; which contains their third unreleased studio album, it is also rare. Plans are for RUFUS ZUPHALL to release a new album this year.

If you are a TULL fan this is likely to please you but ZUPHALL liked their music raw and not-too-refined, but it should please all addicts of early 70's prog.
