21st Century Sin was a progressive speed-metal project with a full length CD released in 1998 called 21st Century Sin and an EP in 2000. In the summer of 2000, 21st Century Sin parted ways. Rick continues to write music for the project, as well as music for anyone else that wants a diverse, experienced songwriter to work with. Although we are a recording project only, we hope fans of metal will enjoy listening to our songs as much as we enjoy writing & recording them.
