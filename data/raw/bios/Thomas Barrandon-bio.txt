Thomas Barrandon is a French electronic music producer.

Graphic designer, musician in love with the seventh art, Thomas blossoms through Carpenter, Spielberg movies, Topor's drawings, Edgar W Froese, Wendy Carlos soundtracks or even Brad Fiedel. His universe characterizes itself by a perfect fusion of vision and sound, a desire to perpetuate the 70/80's imagery aesthetic. Cold, wistful, melancholic, cosmic, dusty, in the way of a sound neurosurgeon, he gets you to go on an immense journey through time and space, remembering you intimates moments of your own existence. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Thomas+Barrandon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
