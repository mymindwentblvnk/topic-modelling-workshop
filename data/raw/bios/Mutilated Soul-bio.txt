Sardinian Death Metal band MUTILATED SOUL was established in late 2003 by bassist Maurizio Serreli and guitar player Nicola Spaziani with the aim to combine fast and aggressive riffs with slow and heavy parts, all in the US death metal style.
The original line-up comprised singer Daniele Pruner (also with Cold Empire), guitarists Nicola Spaziani and Mirko Vacca, bassist Maurizio Serreli and Giacomo Macis on drums.
In February 2005, Giacomo left the band due to personal reasons and at the same time the band spreads a promo-cd with 2 tracks, recorded by Pietro Pisu at Music Studios in Cagliari.

Between August and September 2005, MUTILATED SOUL enter the AudioStudio (Cagliari) to record the first official album with Raphael Saini (Chaoswave, Blu Infinito) as session drummer. Then the “Decomposition” Ep was mixed at the Selani Studios (Vader, Behemoth) by Adam Kuc. In October 2005, Stefano Spanu joins MUTILATED SOUL on drums and the band begun to have some shows.
From March 2006 the “Decomposition” EP was available from the official MUTILATED SOUL’s website.
The band played as opening act for IMPALED NAZARENE and MASTER at the Transilvania Live in Cagliari in 2006, NECRODEATH, DRILLER KILLER and MISERY INDEX at the Titty Twister in 2007.
