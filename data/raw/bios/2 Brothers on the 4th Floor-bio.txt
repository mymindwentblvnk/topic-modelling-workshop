2 Brothers On The 4th Floor are the Dutch brothers Martin and Bobby Boer.

For years, Martin and Bobby Boer had been experimenting with music in a little bedroom. But then in 1990 things really started to happen for them, the single Can't Help Myself was picked up by Dutch radiostations and became an international hit.

After two singles the project was put on a halt. Martin moved into a new professional studio and started making remixes under the name Dancability Productions. He made remixes for acts like Becky Bell and Twenty 4 Seven. In the meanwhile Bobby was busy designing record-covers and CD-inlays.

In 1994 they decided to revive the 2 Brothers on the 4th Floor-project. Bobby joined Martin in his studio and after a while the two presented Never Alone. This single was the first to be launched with rapper D-Rock (real name is Renee Philips) and singer Des'Ray (real name is Desir√©e Claudette Manders). The song "Dreams", the title cut from their first album, was a major hit nationally and internationally inasmuch as it epitomized the essence of Euro-dance, which was popular when the song released in 1994.

The renewed style and concept were accepted well by the Dutch audience.

Two albums (Dreams (1994) and 2 (1996)) and nineteen singles have been released so far. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/2+Brothers+on+the+4th+Floor">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
