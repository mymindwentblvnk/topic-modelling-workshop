Hailing from Adelaide, South Australia, Day Of Wrath was formed in July 2007. Initially assembled to honor a gig commitment that was booked for Luke, Mozez & Greg's other band, stigMARTYR, they could not appear as planned and not wanting the opportunity to pass by a call was made to Scott (ex- Raw Carnage) to provide vocals for the new outfit.
 Only 2 rehearsals were held before the planned gigs and the band confidently took to the stage and poured out with energy and skull crushing vibe.

Day Of Wrath's style is, in a word, METAL. break it down into sub-genres all you like, its all heavy fucking metal.

Several songs have been released via the internet over the past few years and the guys have performed only a handfull of gigs but plans for an album in 2011 are currently being put in place.

Day Of Wrath are a potent metal force and their live show will kick your ass!
