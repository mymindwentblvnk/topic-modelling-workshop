Incite remains one of the most formidable and fresh forces in heavy metal. Their third full-length album, Up In Hell, reinforces that status. Teamingup with award-winning super producer Matt Hyde [Deftones, Slayer], the Phoenix, AZ quintet unleash a torrent of staggering grooves, thrashing riffs, and pummeling rhythms. Over the years, they've toured alongside the likes of Dillinger Escape Plan, Soulfly, Throwdown, Cavalera Conspiracy, and more. Moreover, they've been extolled by everybody from Kerrang! and Revolver to ARTISTdirect. In addition, they've gone Top 40 on Sirius Metal Charts with tracks like "Army of Darkness" and The Devil's Dozen on Liquid Metal with "The Aftermath". Revolver also named All Out War its "Album of the Week" upon release. However, thereâ€™s nothing like spending time in Hell with them.
