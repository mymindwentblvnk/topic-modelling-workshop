Genesis:

In the beginning, in a small town in southern Finland, there were three men, Martin Gestranius, Johan Nordström,Jesper Jakobsson involved in several harmonious projects. Although various styles were explored, none of them came close to what they wanted to achieve.
After many sit-downs, among the three, of endless planning and attempts to reach the complete sonic satisfaction,
they decided to join forces and take care of it themselves.

A new project was born.


Exodus:

The original idea was to progress upon one of the members’ one-man projects, but as time evolved, so did the band. As the ideas grew, the three noticed that they had created something great. A few months was spent on preparations and the journey of recording as well as perfecting the sound initially craved some more time. Vast in both theory and performance, the music itself came to represent a richer, darker side of melody & the lyrics a grandiose extravaganza of controlled emotions. “Metal” is the only real keyword here, and within the endless possibilities in the aforementioned field, the band delivers the final command.


Intra:

The band was initially called “Cruor Deum” (Gestranius’ pet project), but after some discussion, it was recognized
that the project was too distinct from the previous material offered under that band name. After finding a painting
(that also serves as the front cover of the demo) by the splendid Deidre Jones, the title of the painting was chosen to represent the band. Thus “Roses Bleed Thorns” was born. This is where we, the three men, stand today. We are convinced you will enjoy our donation to humanity. Where we go from this point, only time will tell,
but our passion for creating the best metal music in this world has not ceased to exist. And it probably never will. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Roses+Bleed+Thorns">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
