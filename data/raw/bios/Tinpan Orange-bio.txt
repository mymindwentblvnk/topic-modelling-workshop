Tinpan Orange is an Australian indie folk band from Melbourne. They formed in 2005 after they were discovered busking on the streets of Darwin, Australia. The band is a trio of musicians, made up of Emily Lubitz as the lead singer and guitarist, with her brother Jesse Lubitz as guitarist and Alex Burkoy as a violinist. The band's style is heavily stylised folk music, combined with romanticism.

The band began to make its name in the live music venues and jazz clubs of Melbourne, sharing the stage with artists such as Renee Geyer, The Whitlams, Clare Bowditch, Deborah Conway, Pete Murray and Tim Rogers.

Expect to hear mellifluous and soulful songs, telling stories, some true and some false, while blurring the lines in between. Lyrics, rhythms and melodies that are as obvious and ambiguous and a straight line drawn on a Cheshire Cats grin.

Tinpan Orange consists of two acoustic guitars, a violin, a mandolin and a stirring rhythm section, all wrapped around a sultry female voice. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tinpan+Orange">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
