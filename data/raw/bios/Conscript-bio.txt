CONSCRIPT, formerly known as Chokehold was formed by drummer Logan Kelso and guitarist Darryl Parkinson, former members of the Doom Metal band, Funeral, from Pretoria.
Parkinson and Kelso soon joined up with vocalist Alex Trapani and bassist Chris Watson, debuting in 2005 at The Snuggery.
 
Hugo Pelzer, ex- from the band  C4, later joined on lead guitar, firming up the already powerful sound adding new dual-guitar dynamics to the lineup. CHOKEHOLD started performing at various venues such as London Calling, Zeplins, Tempos as well as larger events like Motherfudd, Seasons Wither, and Grimfest.
 After the departure of Chris due to career opportunities in USA, and a name clash with other bands named CHOKEHOLD in the UK and USA, the band became CONSCRIPT.
Shane Pennicott, lead guitarist for SA Metal Gods Agro, was approached to assist on bass while a replacement was hunted down for Chris, but CONSCRIPT had yet another loss with Hugo leaving soon thereafter but was replaced by newcomer Dean Brown. All the while, CONSCRIPT focused on the recording of their debut album: "The Clearest Illusion".
CONSCRIPT has evolved from these moments of history in the making, and achieves its unique sound through the musical talents of members that have long been involved in the music industry, allowing a different approach to SA Metal and enlarging their views on cause and effect through their music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Conscript">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
