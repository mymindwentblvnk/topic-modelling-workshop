After Tsjuder split up: Nag formed Krypt with the old Tsjuder drummer Desecrator.

Krypt was started in 2006 by Nag (guitars, bass and vocals) and Desecrator (drums), with the inspiration of keeping the flame of pure old school Black Metal alive. Both members have long experience from other bands; Nag from Tsjuder, Isvind and Gehenna, and Desecrator from Tsjuder and Furze. Krypt is based upon this experience, and their shared musical and anti-religious views.

Krypt signed to Agonia Records for one 10” and two albums. The 10” will be recorded in the end of November 2006, and the first album will be recorded during the summer of 2007.

There is also an artist called Krypt that makes electronic music. It was the artist of week 11 of Audiosurf.
