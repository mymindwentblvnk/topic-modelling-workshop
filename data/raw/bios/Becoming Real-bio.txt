Before grime dominated the UK charts, there was a time when the genre still remained a firmly underground concern, born of frustration and a pure artistic vision. Channelling this early approach is Becoming Realâ€˜s hyper-real form of mutant grime.

Becoming Real first started making music in the forgotten suburbs of South London, influenced as much by a conceptual future dystopia as by luminaries Zomby & Mount Eerie. Forging his own deformed take on first wave grime, Becoming Real evokes a sense of dread that conjures images of seas drowned in oil and tar-coated forests. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Becoming+Real">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
