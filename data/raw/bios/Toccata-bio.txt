Toccata is a Mexican symphonic quintet from Le√≥n, Guanajuato, formed in 1997 by guitarist Alonso Romero.

After coming back from Los Angeles, California, Romero decided to reorientate the band in 2003 to a style marked by a contemporary  flavored symphonic rock that combines the power of the modern prog with 70's stuff.

Of particular note is the keyboard work (similar to Emerson, Wakeman, Corea),  resulting in a very fresh and vigorous style, ideal for fans of bands such as ELP, Yes or  Dream Theater.


In 2004 the band began the recording process of their self-titled album in the Scatt studios of Sergio Vallin in Aguascalientes, a task  that saw the addition of a new face in the band: singer Andrea Medina.

The same year, Toccata signed with Mylodon Records for the release of Circe, a conceptual album consisting  of eight compositions that demonstrates an experienced band on the path of modern progressive symphonic rock, with technical  passages of fusion complementing an energetic quota that puts them in a great position in the continuing quality of the Mexican prog  scene. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Toccata">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
