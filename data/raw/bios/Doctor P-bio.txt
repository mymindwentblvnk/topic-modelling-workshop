Doctor P is the stage name of the English dubstep record producer and DJ, Shaun Brockhurst (born 9 April 1986). Shaun also produces drum and bass under the aliases Sounds Destructive (with Zachary Kemp, currently known as Trolley Snatcha), Slum Dogz (with DJ Swan-E and Krafty MC) and DJ Picto (or simply Picto). He is the co-founder of Circus Records, along with Flux Pavilion (who is a childhood friend), DJ Swan-E and Earl Falconer.

Doctor P is definitely the leader of the new wave of wobbles and whomps in Dubstep and goes against the normal ingredients needed. His song Sweet Shop set the benchmark for others to follow as this doctor's surgical dissection of Dubstep music leaves people wanting more than just the doctor's diagnosis!

Over the last decade Doctor P has played clubs and festivals all over the globe, including some of the biggest festivals on Earth. He has released a number of successful original tracks and remixes, including remixes for artists such as Ed Sheeran, DJ Fresh and Dillon Francis, and has collaborated with a number of high-profile artists like Method Man, Eva Simons, Far East Movement and many more. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Doctor+P">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
