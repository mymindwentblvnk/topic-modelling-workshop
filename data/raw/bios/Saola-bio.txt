SAOLA has seen its large share of members and genres before officially going public as a metal band, long before their current lineup. Founded by Elliott as a Tool influenced progressive metal band, the band has gone through phases of playing progressive metal, hardcore punk, avant-garde, noise rock, shoegaze, math rock and grindcore, while going through many members until the lineup found itself at a turning point to play metal, being Elliott Cunningham, Ethan Conrad, Alex Harris and Malcolm Luis. 

Despite the fact that the boys still struggled to find their sound aside from the crushing riffs of their debut song "The Lieutenant", several shows were booked in Portland, many of which only were put on for close friends of the members. The band found itself sticking with a stoner/doom vibe after Elliott returned to the band from a small hiatus after their first performance at Anarres Infoshop, located in St. John's. Ever since then, the band had officially found their sound, style and official active lineup (Elliott Cunningham, Ethan Conrad, Zack Trani, Malcolm Luis). 
SAOLA has been booking bigger venues and getting their name out to the public even more so than before (a SAOLA article can be found in the Willamette Week newsletter, written by Nathan Carson). 

The band continues to strive to reach many milestones that await the dark Joy Division influenced Elliott, upbeat bluegrass/classic rock influenced Zack, tasteful Pink Floyd influenced Ethan, and dangerously hard-hitting doom influenced Malcolm. Their long journey has only just started, and have yet to play out of state.
