Talking Pets is not a band! It’s just one guitar, one drum kit, one bass guitar, one synthesizer, no tricks! There are four members, two different hair cuts, three mustaches, three driver’s licenses and definitely no fear of pop music. Their interests besides music: swedish food and furniture, girls who can sing and… girls who can’t. All band members are located in munich, yet they are not rich. Maybe they will be someday, but not now. During the winter some of them tend to wear warm shoes, others don’t. There are plans that the band is going to play a show in your hometown soon. But plans may change. They also provide a special feature for those of you who own a cd player: there will be a full-length compact disc containing music the boys have recorded.
