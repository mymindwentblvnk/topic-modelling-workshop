The raw, fiery Phoenix, AZ Black Metal quartet of Mortiferus was formed in 2004, by the quartet of Acerbus (v), Obsidian (g), Atrox (g), and Securis (d). 

They achieved some notoriety locally and abroad, when Atrox mysteriously disappeared, shortly after being kicked out of the band following the release of 2005's 'Atra Arx', and is still legally listed as a missing person. 

After some lineup shifts, the band found themselves with the current lineup of Acerbus (v), Ragnvaldr (g), and Securis (d). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mortiferus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
