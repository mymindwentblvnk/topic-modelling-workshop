Formed in 2004 by Matador (guitar) and Prata (drums), Fuck..Em All was a Metallica tribute band that later led to the current Portuguese thrash metal act Revolution Within.
Faster (guitar) and Ra√ßa (vocals) were invited to enter the group, and after deciding to continue the project, no longer as the tribute band they were, Sono (bass) joined them.
Revolution Within started playing live in late 2005 and are currently recording their first EP. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Revolution+Within">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
