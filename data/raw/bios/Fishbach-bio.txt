Fishbach (real name Flora Fischbach), born on 6 September 1991 in Dieppe, is a French singer-songwriter.

Fishbach is from Charleville-Mézières, the same town as famous rebellious French poet Arthur Rimbaud. Her music is unashamedly reviving French 1980s new wave pop music. With a slick coat of polished synths and beats, she matches her modern production with haunting, disconcerting vocals. A deluxe release of her debut album was released on 16 February 2018. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fishbach">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
