Korol i Shut ("King and Jester" in Russian; abbreviated as "KISH") was a horror punk band from Russia. Their lyrics, full of black humor, were inspired by folk tales about ghosts, pirates, vampires, and the like. The band was at a peak popularity in the 2000s, and disbanded in 2013 after the death of its founder Mikhail Gorsheneov.

KiSH was founded in 1988 in Leningrad by Gorshok (Mikhail Gorshenev) and his schoolmates. In 1990 Knyaz' (Andrey Kniazev) joined the band and proposed its name. KISH remained an amateur underground band for many years, but with the release of their first album "Kamnem po golove" in 1996 they became well-known in the Russian rock community, and this popularity increased greatly in the next five years.

Band's main genre is discussed, because  their music includes elements of both punk and rock with a bit of folk. The lyrics represent fantasy and horror stories about trolls, witches and pirates.  Another common topic is alcohol abuse. 

The group ceased to exist in July of 2013 with the death of Mikhail Gorshenev. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/%D0%9A%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8C+%D0%B8+%D0%A8%D1%83%D1%82">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
