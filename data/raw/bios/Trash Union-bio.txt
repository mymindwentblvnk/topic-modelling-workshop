TRASH UNION is Serbian crossover band created at the end of '90s and indisputably very important band when it comes to hardcore scene in Serbia...
     It's influenced by many different styles of heavy music. From Bay Area thrash metal and Venice beach skate scene to New York's hardcore punk and both east and west coast hip hop.... Probably the most important thing that unifies these music directions in TRASH UNION is the time of release (which took place from late '80s to early '90s) and it's strictly defined there: To keep the authentic sense of old school music...
The main characteristic of this band is raw energy, aggressive riffs, mock mediocrity, fighting against ignorance and to provide friendly advices to people via text...
