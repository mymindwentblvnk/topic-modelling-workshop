Hateflesh came to be in August 2009, when a group of four experienced musicians wanted to do some real, no-frills death metal. After a few get-togethers, the band had figured out their style and ideology. Thus, they started writing material by mixing old school death metal with some riff-based metal

The band started recording their first demo, titled “We bring the end”, in October 2009 at their own Fleshate studio. Said demo was finished in January 2010. Soon after this, the band took on an additional member. HV, ex-Rapture vocalist and main man in Diablerie, took over the duty of main vocals. HV learned the ways of hate quickly, and rehearsing for their first gigs began. And now, in early 2010... ready- steady- kill! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hateflesh">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
