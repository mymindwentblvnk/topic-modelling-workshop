There are currently at least three bands named Organic:

1. The project started in 2011 after a common Post New Wave Tour of Graceland and Silver Riot;
Joris Oster (ex YEL and Silver Riot), Raphaël Haubourdin (EX Graceland and current KINEX KINEX) and Olivier Justin (EX PHC) decided to create an electro band merging the power of a fuzzy bass guitar with electronic signals. After few nights spent in a recording studio, Alchemy took place with a lot of post-punk accents.
Joris delivers hard bass tones in accordance with the Keys sequences and deep voices of Raphaël Haubourdin.

The result of this work produced a record published in compact-disc and double vinyl called "under your carbon constellation" which will be released on Swedish label CCP.
The group enjoys some exhibitions in Europe with dates in Germany, britain and suede. The band plays many times alongside Agent Side Grinder opens Graham Coxon (BLUR) and Disapears.

They are currently working on a ablum to be proposed in 2015, pieces having already been proposed on specialized podcast in Belgium.
