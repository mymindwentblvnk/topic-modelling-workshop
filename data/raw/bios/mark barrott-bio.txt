"One of the worldâ€™s finest purveyors of music to chill out to - he is the master of sunset music" (Pitchfork).
Starting out in the mid 90s as Future Loop Foundation, Mark Barrott went on to conquer the balearic underground with his legendary imprint International Feel.
In recent times it's his own productions that have won the plaudits, especially his 'Sketches From An Island' projects.   less
