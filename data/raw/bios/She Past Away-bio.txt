She Past Away is a dark wave band from Bursa, Turkey. The group was formed by Volkan Caner (vocal/guitar) and Idris Akbulut (bass) in 2006. With the live participation of Doruk Ozturkcan in electronic drums, the band was totally shaped by the end of 2009.

Idris Akbulut left She Past Away in 2015 and was replaced by Doruk Ozturkcan as a permanent member. 

Clashing gothic lyrics with buzzsaw guitars, allegedly broken vocals and sensory drum effects, the band evokes the cavernous experiments of darkwave era with the likes of Fields of the Nephilim, The Sisters of Mercy, Bauhaus and Suicide.

After a long demo-recording session, in 2009, the duo joined to Remoov Records in which they began to work on their debut release with SÃ¼permatik. 

The common characteristic of their live performances is that they combine their well-positioned rawk tunes and harsh textures with paranoia-inducing industrial visuals, which are created by Asli Narin. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/She+Past+Away">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
