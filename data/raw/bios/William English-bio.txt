William English.

Our sound is not for the faint hearted. we hold no genre boundary's and there is no particular sound we aim for other than what we like.
If we were to sum up the sound of these two tracks it would be.. 30 stone riffs with screams so socially unpopular it makes the cool kids cry and drum beats that bring it together to make u wana mosh,two step,dance or just generally sit back and enjoy.
We've only just begun to damage your ears. If this sound disgusts you please say so, if you love it and want more please say so. if you don't understand it, ask. We are William English!
