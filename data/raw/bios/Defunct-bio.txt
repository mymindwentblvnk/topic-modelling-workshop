2) Rapcore band from Windham, Maine. (1997-2000) Way back in the early 80's, four losers were born. They grew up and in 1998 they all met each other and decided to go buy some instruments. They were influenced by the New Kids on the Block, MC Hammer, and Barry White but they couldn't play anything so it didn't matter. These four posers played crappy covers and called themselves deFunct. In February of 1998, everything changed though. In a distant galaxy, four aliens decided to warp themselves to the planet Earth. These aliens were very cool, good looking, and renowned musicians. They morphed to Earth and kidnapped the four dorks and stole their instruments. They wrote several songs mixing rap with hardcore while disguised as the earthlings. They inherited the name deFunct and started to play some shows. Defunct recorded the 5 song Wombat E.P. in 1999 and 4 song Self Titled Album in 2000. They quickly began to dominate the world music industry and had to break up in 2000 before everyone discovered their true identities. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/defunct">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
