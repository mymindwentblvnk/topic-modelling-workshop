Raised in Seoul, Korean singer, songwriter, rapper, house and techno dj 박혜진 (park hye jin) blends elements of dream-state house, raw hip-hop & psychedelic darkwave and mixes her own English and Korean vocals over dreamy synths & thick beats for a forward-thinking dancefloor experience.

A resident DJ at Seoul’s Pistil Dance Club, with broadcast performances on Korean independent radio SCR, Park exploded into view in January 2019 with her late-’18 debut EP IF U WANT IT. The five-track EP with breakout tracks I Don't Care and ABC finds Park singing duets with herself in both Korean & English over leftfield soundscapes, thunderous 4/4 beats & smoky digital piano lines, and has sparked popular interest in the emergence of "k-house" as a potential cross-over form of electronic music, while also introducing the voice of new underground sensation. How Can I followed in 2020 on Ninja Tune, as she relocated to Los Angeles.

Her first full LP came in September 2021: Before I Die featured Let's Sing Let's Dance. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/%EB%B0%95%ED%98%9C%EC%A7%84+park+hye+jin">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
