Swedish indie rock duo Pale Honey consists of guitarist Tuva Lodmark and drummer Nelly Daltrey. They have been performing music together since elementary school, bonding over a mutual love for acts like Queens of the Stone Age and PJ Harvey. While the two-piece’s sound has evolved since those early years, they’ve managed to maintain a distinct, stripped-down approach. This is readily apparent on Pale Honey, their self-titled debut which was recorded in producer Anders Lagerfors’ kitchen. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pale+Honey">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
