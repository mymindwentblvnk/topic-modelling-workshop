Bad Steve was a German heavy metal band composed of former Accept members Jan Koemmet, Frank Friedrich and Dieter Rubach, as well as former members of more obscure bands Kanaan and Sin City. They supported Accept on a 1984 tour in Germany. Rubach later had a brief stint with Accept vocalist Udo Dirkschneider's band U.D.O. Koemmet had been with Accept previous to their recording career and re-entered that band briefly between their releases Breaker and Restless and Wild. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bad+Steve">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
