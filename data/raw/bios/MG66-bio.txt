MG66 is a new band born in 2007 in northern Italy. The name comes from both MG42, the lethal machine gun developed by Germany during WWII, and the legendary route 66.

"We wanted a name to represent the violence and the power of our music combined with the rock n' roll spirit 'on the road'" Steve C.H. says, bass player and main songwriter of the band.

The music is a mixture of different powerful genres that go from the fast and furious thrash metal of Slayer to the groovy power of Pantera and to the killing military feel of Rammstein.

"We've always tried to put a lot of energy in our music and to communicate it to the audience ... usually it works fine" Cla Vanza says, drummer and co-founder with C.H. of the band, "We never cared about what genre we are playing, we just like powerful music with good vibes and that's all what matters" C.H adds.

The first full length album "In the House of Liv" of the band, was produced by Italian sound engineer Mauro Andreolli in 2008.

"In this album we put all our musical influences. Each one of us has its own, sometimes very different, and that's fine because the result is something a little bit unusual that can't be define in a precise genre. We like to call what we play 'thrash n' roll'" Steve says about the album. 

The whole recording process of the album took 5 months. The band has been focused on recreating the powerful feeling of their live shows, trying to perform as natural as possible. "We didn't use any trigger or fictional sound, we just wanted everything to sound natural and powerful, a true rock n' roll approach" Vanza adds.
