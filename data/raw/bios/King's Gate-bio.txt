King's Gate was a Christian metal band formed in the late 80's and lasting through the late 90's. Although primarily a "live" band, they released one recording and unfortunately split up a few years later. Their sound changed from hair/80's metal to a darker sound as they gravitated towards what would later be classified as goth & doom metal.
