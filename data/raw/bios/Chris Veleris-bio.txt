Chris was born in Athens, Greece in 1982. His first contact with the guitar was when he was about 10-11 years old when someone bought him a classical guitar as a gift. He started composing stuff with his drum machine and sequencer and as the years were going by, the style begun to unfold by his hands. 

At the end of 2003, he recorded a demo cd with his band DISSOLVE playing some kind of bay area thrash metal (in which he also sang). Also by the beginning of 2004 he recorded another demo cd with INSECTED playing technical death metal. Nevertheless, he left INSECTED and DISSOLVE was abandoned for a while. 

In January 2007 Chris finished mixing his first personal demo cd “So close yet so far away” , including three instrumental songs. Also, he joined forces with SCAR OF THE SUN as a guitar player. 

The high-profile producer Rhys Fulber (Paradise Lost, Fear Factory, Waltari, Motley Crue, Megadeth, Machine Head, Mudvayne, Roadrunner All-stars, Nailbomb, P.O.D., Alice Cooper, Yes, Avril Lavigne, Front Line Assembly, Delerium, Conjure One, Sarah Brightman, etc.) co-produced and mixed their debut album “A series of unfortunate concurrencies”, while Greg Reely (Paradise Lost, Strapping Young Lad, Theatre Of Tragedy, Fear Factory, Machine Head, The Tea Party, Coldplay, Frontline Assembly, Delerium, Conjure One, Sarah McLachlan, Mediaeval Baebes, etc.) took over the mastering process of the album. The release day of the album is to be announced.
