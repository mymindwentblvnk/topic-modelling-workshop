Rezinwolf was first formed in 2009 as an intense 4 piece thrash force. Based in the UK, they delivered blisteringly fast songs with musical ingenuity and precise technicality. 

Rezinwolf released their critically acclaimed debut album "Corruption Kingdom" through "Killer Metal Records" in 2013 to rave reviews, accumulating in being invited to play at the esteemed "Bloodstock Festival" and an appearance of the album's lead single "Hail to Armageddon" on the cover mount compilation CD of respected UK metal magazine "Metal Hammer".

After another short hiatus in 2015, rhythm guitarist and vocalist Danny "murph" Murphy and bassist Ed Munson decided to reinvent the band and introduce new lead guitarist Mitch "Faz" Farrington and new drummer Josh Moreton, adding new qualities to the band and the sound. 

Rezinwolf now look forward to many years of rocking with the strongest line-up and mightiest sound they've ever had. 

Stay tuned for exciting announcements!
