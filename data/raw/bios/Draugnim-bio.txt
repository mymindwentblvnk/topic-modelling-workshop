The story began 1999, when Morior and Chimedra joined forces to bring light to the stories of old pagan past with strong melodies and raw expression, emphasizing on mood rather than technical boasting. Three demos were recorded between 2000 and 2003 with the band developing an original sound during the years. After 2003, the drummer and the keyboardist left the band causing a temporary standstill. Finally in 2007 it was decided that a new demo should be recorded. Morior, Chimedra and Turms rented a small studio that suited their needs. With the experience and effort of sound-engineer Henri Sorvali and drummer Repe Misanthrope, Sworn To Waves was quickly recorded. Sworn To Waves was instantly found by labels and so Draugnim signed with Spikefarm only a few months after the release of the demo.
The first full-length will be released in the fall of 2008.
