Pearl Charles (born May 11, 1991) is an American singer-songwriter from Los Angeles, CA. She aims to embody California rock and roll and, as a figure in the local music scene (and beyond) she began touring as a member of old-timey Americana duo The Driftwood Singers, at age 18, followed by a lengthy stint drumming and singing in garage-pop band, The Blank Tapes. The Blank Tapes toured extensively and earned accolades from Rolling Stone and The New Yorker for their sunny lo-fi surf rock. Along the way, Pearl collaborated with artists such as Jonathan Wilson, Stephen McBean (Black Mountain), Farmer Dave Scher (Beachwood Sparks) and Johnathan Rice and toured extensively internationally supporting diverse artists such as Father John Misty, Matt Costa, Thee Oh Sees, Kim Deal, The Growlers, Allah Las and Mystic Braves to name a few, as well as earning a BFA in Music from CalArts.

Embarking on a solo career in 2015, Pearl is set to solidify her own name and place by releasing a 6 song debut EP on Burger Records this summer. Pearl recorded her self-titled EP track by track with a select group of producers and a little help from her friends, many of whom are notable L.A. musicians in their own right including Joel Jerome (La Sera, Cherry Glazerr) and Taylor Locke (Rooney). Though she draws inspiration from the legendary scenes of the 60's and 70's, from Laurel Canyon to The Factory, from Haight-Ashbury to Muscle Shoals, she also counts contemporary artists amongst her influences such as Tame Impala, Mac DeMarco, Sharon Van Etten and Jenny Lewis, to name a few. Pearl Charles writes and sings songs with a distinctly unique voice, creating a sound that is both timeless yet undeniably here, now. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pearl+Charles">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
