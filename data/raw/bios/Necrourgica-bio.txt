A black metal band that formed when unnoticed demo, "corrode", came out november 2013, with only Ecoas, using drum machines and sounding close to white noise even by black metal standards. 

Then the EP "A Sense of Wilderness" featuring Vaasgoth on drums was recorded and released April 2014, featuring significant evolution. While Vaasgoth was originally credited as a session musician, he eventually committed as a full member making the band a two piece. August of that same year, we returned to the studio to produce a follow up EP "The Second Age of Satan", a stylistically varied and death metal influenced tangent of the necrourgica sound.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Necrourgica">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
