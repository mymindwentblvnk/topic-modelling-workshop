Lymphatic Phlegm is a Brazilian goregrind duo formed in 1996 in Curitiba (PR) by Rodrigo Alcantara (guitar, bass, drum programming) and Andre Luiz (vocals). The band now is one of the leaders in the style thanks to their sick and experimental compositions. They have 2 full-lengths and a multitude of splits.  They are known particularly for their inventive riff composition style, which draws influences from black metal with a clear, echo-driven, hollow tone making for memorable, even epic, single songs and cohesive albums.
