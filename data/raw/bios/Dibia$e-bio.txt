Donell McGary, known professionally as Dibia$e, is an American alternative hip hop producer from Watts, Los Angeles, California. Dibia$e released his debut album, Machines Hate Me, on Alpha Pup Records in 2010. Before doing music, he made a living as a graphic artist. Unlike most hip-hop producers who use the Akai MPC and SP-1200, he primarily utilizes the SP-303 and SP-404, for they provide a gritty lo-fi sound. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dibia$e">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
