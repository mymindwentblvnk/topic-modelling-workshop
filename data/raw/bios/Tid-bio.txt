The Swedish post-metal band Tid are pretentious with very high ambition in creating music that feels, rather than tell you what to think.
They create music that tells of visions of the unseen, a suggestive sound of thoughts.
As a group that only writes, record and rehearse when they are inspired. In that manner they always form music that called for themselves.
