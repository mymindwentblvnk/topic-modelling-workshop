Blackened Sky was a thrash metal band from the early 1990's. Formed by Tad Leger (Toxik, Prime Evil), Mark Peffers and Anthony Marino. The music was a hybrid of old school thrash, doom and some Motorhead, Ramones after Andy Abbene (Bro of Jay Abbene, Wrathchild America, Sould at Zero) joined up for their second demo.
