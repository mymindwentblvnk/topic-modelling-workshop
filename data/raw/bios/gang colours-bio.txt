As a portal into a world of daydreams, tumbling into shadows and embracing luminescence simultaneously, Gang Colours turns drum patterns into magic. Breeding surreal headphone-friendly landscapes, he fills them with unexpected sounds that would otherwise seem out of place. 

Within his intricate collages however, they nestle so comfortably – it’s hard to remember their usual context. At times his sound effects strike a peculiar balance between otherworldly and familiarity (reminiscent of slide whistles or insects buzzing). At other points they conjure a sense of longing. Think Mount Kimbie with a playful sense of humour, Burial on a soft, sunny dancefloor, Gold Panda with an R&B lean. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gang+Colours">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
