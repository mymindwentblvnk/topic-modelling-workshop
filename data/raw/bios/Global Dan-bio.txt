Global Dan is an animated, dexterous rapper and songwriter hailing from Silver Spring, Maryland, happily finding his footing as a multifaceted, hip-hop-leaning recording artist. As a teenager growing up in the DMV area, Dan began finding solace in the burgeoning underground scene that soundtracked his high school years. After trying his hand at rapping for the first time, Dan decided to fully embrace his moniker and take his bourgeoning career to new heights.

While only a year deep in the game, Global Dan released his breakthrough track, 2017’s “Off-White,” with the infectious Mongo-assisted single going on to amass over 6 million streams and garner the attention of Louis Vuitton's artistic director and Off-White founder himself. With a coveted cosign from, Virgil Abloh, who later personally designed the cover art for the song’s remix featuring Rich The Kid and Madeintyo, Global Dan went on to release his debut mixtape, Global Warming. Global Dan has since gone on to collaborate with G-Eazy (“Wasabi”), AzN (“Dark Out”) and Lil Skies (“Moving On”), with the latter receiving the visual treatment from reputed illustrator, Distortedd. From a self-made rapper to advocate for mental health, Global Dan is ready to embrace wherever his promising career in music takes him next, all while staying true to himself. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Global+Dan">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
