Christopher Young (b. 1957) is an award-winning composer of music for film and television.

Born on 28th April 1957 in Redbank, New Jersey, Young graduated from Hampshire College in Massachusetts with a Bachelor of Arts in music, and then did postgraduate work at North Texas State University. In 1980 he moved to Los Angeles. A jazz drummer at first, hearing some of Bernard Herrmann's works convinced him to be a film composer. At the UCLA Film School, he studied under David Raskin.  He teaches at the Thornton School of Music of the University of Southern California.

Many of his music compositions are for horror films, including Hellraiser, Tales from the Hood, A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge, Urban Legend, and Drag Me to Hell. Other works include Lucky You, The Shipping News and Spider-Man 3, for which he received the Film & TV Music Award for Best Score for a Dramatic Feature Film. He also made three cameo appearances in Spider-Man 3.
