TORMAN MAXT is a progresive/metal band from California, US. 
The progressive metal band Torman Maxt has always been three brothers: Tony, Vincent and Dominic Massaro. Originally hailing from Ft Myers, Florida, the trio made the cross country move to Los Angeles, California where they recorded several demos before meeting vocalist Martin DeBourge. After recording and releasing their debut album titled “Just Talking About the Universe... So Far”, Torman Maxt performed extensively at local Hollywood clubs and throughout Southern California. The band's sound has been compared to progressive rock greats like Rush, Dream Theater, Queensryche & Yes while still reminding rock fans of their other main influences, Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin.

For their second album “The Foolishness of God”, Tony Massaro began to handle all of the vocal duties in addition to his role as guitarist and song writer. Together with brothers Vincent and Dominic, they have been playing since they were teenagers. This has created a tightness and unity that is evident on their recordings.

Their newest album entitled “The Problem of Pain: Part 1” is a concept album based on the book of Job, with the title taken from the book by C.S. Lewis which investigates why God allows human suffering on earth. The album has already met with rave reviews: TheProgFiles.com has said “...not since Rush 2112 has there been a concept album of this caliber.” The album is the first of a two album set, with Part 2 due out in early 2010.
