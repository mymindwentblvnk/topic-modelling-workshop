Igorrr (birth name is Gautier Serre) is a composer of electronic and acoustic music who mixes genres as widely-varying as breakcore, glitch, baroque, death metal, and trip-hop among others. He is based in France and has been composing music since 2006.

«I just want to make the music I love, without asking myself if it's gonna be too complex or too far from what people like. I want to make the music which has sense to me, with no restrictions, like a big party with metalheads, electronics nerds, classical and baroque-heads and gypsy violinists getting drunk and joining together to bring the best of every genre.»
— Gautier Serre

Initially influenced by the likes of Meshuggah, Chopin, Cannibal Corpse, Bach, Domenico Scarlatti, Taraf de Haidouks and Aphex Twin, traces of these artists can be found littered across Igorrr’s discography, but Serre has never been interested in remaining static or merely recycling ideas, and his work has dramatically evolved accordingly. It deeply explains how Igorrr’s music is such an explosion of creativity while keeping a cohesive universe records after records.
In recent years, Igorrr has also become a collective, rather than the work of one man alone, which has brought a new level of intensity into the group live representations.

He released Nostril (2010) and Hallelujah (2012) on Ad Noiseam. And Savage Sinusoid (2017) on Metal Blade Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Igorrr">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
