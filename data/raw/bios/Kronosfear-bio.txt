Since, around, 2002 kronosfear has been building an onslaught of pure metal tunes. Mic(guitar) came across Neil(drums) back in the late summer of 1998. Back then, Mic was playing in a black/death metal band with Melvin Bryant called Empire of Frost... but as things seem to always do, the band fell apart and we all went our seperate ways. No less than 2 years later Mic & Neil colaberated with a few other people and thus the short lived End of Eternity came about, but it was not enough to quench the urge to play real metal again, so Mic and Neil grabbed Kevan(bass) from the band forming the first line up for Kronosfear, We have since parted ways with Neil(Drums) and have found a line up that is going strong now! We are aiming to be in Studios for November 2007, for our Full Length Debut, SO WATCH OUT! We're Coming To A Stereo Near You! Cheers & Live For Metal!!!! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kronosfear">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
