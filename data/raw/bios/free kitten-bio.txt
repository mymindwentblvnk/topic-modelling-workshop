Free Kitten is a collaboration between Sonic Youth's Kim Gordon and Pussy Galore's Julia Cafritz. Boredoms member Yoshimi P-We eventually took up the task of drumming, and Pavement's Mark Ibold joined later on as bassist. They released a handful of albums and singles, mainly on Kill Rock Stars, including a remix 12" featuring DJ Spooky. They toured on 1993's Lollapalooza. In 2008, they released Inherit, their first album in ten years.
