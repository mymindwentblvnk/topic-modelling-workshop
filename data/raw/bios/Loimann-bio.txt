The band officially born in 2001 under the influence of major stoner bands (Kyuss, Fu Manchu, Monster Magnet etc), with the lyrics initially in italian.
After the realization of three autoproduced (from 2003 to 2006), various live activity in Piemonte (Turin's region) gigs with foreigner bands like, Demons, Volt, Deville, or italian like Dead Elephant, Cani Sciorri, Radio Black Out Festival, gigs in Piemonte, Liguria, France, Spain, etc.
After some lineup changes the band reaches his stability with the actual trio: Fabio (vox/guit), Dario (bass) and Enrico (drum).
The sound of the band, however, changes in the last two tears, leaving the mere stoner influences (like in the beginning and on the first three cds), for a more doom/heavy psych approach and with a consistent dilation of the songs.
Actually the band has just finished to record/mix/master his new album at Danny Giordana (sound engineer with Monster Magnet, Hatebreed, Eye Hate God, and Ozzfest amongst others) One Voice
Studios ( www.onevoicestudio.it).
After that, several other live experiences within Italy (together onstage with intarnational acts like Los Natas, Crippled Black Phoenix), and abroad (Montpellier, Mende, Barcelona). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Loimann">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
