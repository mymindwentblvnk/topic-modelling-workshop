In 1992 SARDONYX released Majestic Serenity on its own Lightshine label. Majestic Serenity has a 80's thrash and power metal sound with a "NO COMPROMISE CHRISTIANITY" message. Each song was designed as a Bible study. Almost every line of the lyrics contains Bible references so the listener can look them up. The music is super tight, super heavy, technical, and incorporates heavy doses of progressive and thrash metal also. Majestic Serenity is pure American Power Metal have a lot in common with bands like Meliah Rage, Sacred Warrior, and Testament, and Metal Church. In September 2007 Retroactive Records re-issued a Limited Edition of just 1000 copies of Majestic Serenity. The CD contains 15 Tracks including four from the 1990 Rebel of Reason demo. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sardonyx">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
