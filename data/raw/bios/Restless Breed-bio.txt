There are multiple artists named Restless Breed

1) Restless Breed is a psychedelic, instrumental, fantasy trip. What separates this band from the rest is that they have the ability to capture the audience and transport them through a musical voyage. Listeners are engulfed in the sounds and become detached from the outside world.

2)RESTLESS BREED was initially formed in Columbus, Ohio in 1985 and were one of the area's first all-original speed metal/thrash bands. The band built up a sizeable local following due to their energetic live performances, and in 1987 recorded their first demo "After the Holocaust". Following some line-up changes, they released their 2nd demo "No Walls Can Hold" in 1989. They received several favorable reviews in the worldwide underground press, and were eventually picked up by England's CMFT Records. However, after many years of struggling to keep a stable line-up together, the band finally called it quits in late 1990. More info at their Myspace Page.

Mike and Dave later had a band called SPEED OF FRIGHT, they did some live gigs but to bad never recorded any demos.
