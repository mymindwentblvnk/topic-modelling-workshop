2007 marked the birth of War of Attrition. The newest addition to the pantheon of metal greats, in the same league as the mainstays they have shared the stage with Killswitch Engage, A life Once Lost, Bleeding Through, and Bury your Dead. Their debut EP “and the void stared back,” was released this fall by the Syracuse based label Krom Records, run by Earth Crisis, Freya, and Path front man Karl Buechner. War of Attrition delivers the percussion of Testament and the catchiness of Carcass’s razor sharp hooks. Front man Billy Price provides and completes the bands sonic assault with all of the power of George from Merauder and the cadences in the vein of Napalm Deaths Barney Greenway. While the bands metal and HC following has been mainly word of mouth, in the northeast the buzz has increased nationwide over the airwaves with radio play on Orlando’s The Dungeon, 105.1 The Backyard, and on the largest all metal radio show in Arizona.
