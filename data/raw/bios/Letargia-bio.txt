The band was created in 2006 willing to transmit the truth about themes such as social inequality, life conditions, social problems caused due to bad income share and other stuff that affect our lives directly.

Their first album (Demo) was recorded in 2007, a rough and low quality production. Their second album, Letargia, was recorded in 2009 and was, as well as the first, a home-made independent production. This record  sets a landmark for the band, for it shows how much the band members evolved musically. Some songs from their third album, Nova Remessa, which is set to be released in 2010, have already been recorded and are avaliable on the band MySpace.
