Formed at the tail end of 2001 by Andy Comer, Joshua Zucker and Bill Kuehn,  Prosaics were a NYC-based band promoted by Matador closely following the huge success of Interpol.  Their only release was their 5 track Aghast Agape EP.  Playing tightly wound post-punk with allusions to Joy Division, they received scathing, and rather unfair reviews from publications such as Pitchfork, which largely accused them of being too pretty. Despite this, they were loved by the printed media and were voted one of New York's top 20 bands in 2002 along with the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Liars, Interpol, Radio 4 and Calla. Due to contractual problems, they broke up in 2005.   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Prosaics">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
