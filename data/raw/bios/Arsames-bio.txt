Arsames is a death metal band from Iran (Mashhad), formed in 2002 by leader and skin pounder Ali Madarshahi (the drummer) and Hamid Yousefi (the guitarist). The members of the band to begin with were Ali Madar Shahi (drums), Hamid Yousefi (guitars), and Ali Sanaei (bass). Ali Azhari joined Arsames later. Right now, they have some pieces of music that we are eager to release as an album, dedicated to all Iranian metal fans and to show other countries that Iran is a great country with lots of talent and potential. Arsames is on a mission to prove that this kind of music is beyond the borders and are not designated to any geographical region in the world (especially the western countries) in contrast; Eastern music with its heavenly melodies can modify death metal music to one of the best pieces of music in history. Now, current  Arsames members are Ali Madarshahi (vocals), Morteza shahrami (Guitars), Hamid alizadeh (Guitars), Saeed Makari (Bass), Saeed shariat (Drums).
