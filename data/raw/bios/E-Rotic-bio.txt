E-Rotic is a German techno/hip house/eurodance group. They are mostly known for their use of sexual topics and innuendo in their music.

Originally comprising of Lyane Leigh and American-born Raz-Ma-Taz (Richard Michael Smith), the group started in 1994 and recorded throughout the rest of the 1990s. However by June 1996, both members of the group had left due to a disagreement between Leigh and producer David Brandes. E-Rotic was now comprised of Jeanette Christensen and Terence d'Arby (not to be confused with Terence Trent D'Arby). Lyane Leigh continued to provide vocal work for several albums until 1999 due to contract, but she and Raz-Ma-Taz formed their own group in the meantime, known as SEX Appeal. In October of the same year, d'Arby was replaced by Ch√© Jouaner.

Christensen left in 2001, and the new vocalist was Yasemin Baysal, previously of the group Das Modul. However, both Jouaner and Baysal left in 2002, and the new vocalist and rapper would be Lydia Madawjewski (who had been providing vocals since Lyane Leigh's departure in 1999) and Robert Spehar. However, it has been revealed that the actual rap performer for the group in the studio has actually been the producer David Brandes. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/E-Rotic">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
