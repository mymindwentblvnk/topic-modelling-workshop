"Brutal beats, solid riffs, punishing singer" -Chris Harris: Gun Shy Assassin.
Psyclosarin are an in your face, chest pounding experience. A perfect meld of melodic and brutal guitar work, intelligent attack of drums and slamming bass riffs held together by an unforgiving assault of vocals mixing guttural, mids and highs; spreading lyrics based on inner reflection, corruption, apathy, and the will to rise above.
Forming in October, 2011, Psyclosarin was birthed from the minds of Steve Gatewood, Mike Gately and Jon Benning; long time friends who had been writing music together several years prior. Kenny Schwer joined on vocals that following December and brought with him the much needed spark that helped take the band to a whole new level of intensity. In March of the following year, James Utt joined as 2nd guitarist with his influences of a more technical feel. After losing long time friend and bassist, Bill Long stepped up and became the final cog in the machine.
First performing live in July 2012, large clubs such as The Agora (Cleveland) and Peabody's were soon to follow, people quickly taking notice of this new, untapped sound.
Psyclosarin continue to write, perform live and are currently recording their first full length album, 'Hidden In Violence'. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Psyclosarin">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
