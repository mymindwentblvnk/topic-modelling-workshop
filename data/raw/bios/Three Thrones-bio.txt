Three Thrones were formed from the ashes of previous band "Tyrantul√∂rr" in January 2011. 

Playing a blend of Doom and Progressive-Sludge Metal, Three Thrones continue to play as many shows as possible and write more riff-worship for anyone who's interested.

Currently Three Thrones have released their debut 4-track EP in July 2012 and are planning their European Tour with fellow local Instrumental Post-Sludge band Telepathy to take place in May 2013.

Also on the horizon is the release of the Three Thrones/William English split, tentatively titled "WETT" and the band are finalising their plans for their second EP.
