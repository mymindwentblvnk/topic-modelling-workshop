Rage Of Light is a Swiss trance metal/melodic death metal band, created by vocalist and keyboardist Jonathan Pellet, known for his past works with Trophallaxy/Drysrider.

Jonathan came up with the idea to create a hybrid of trance and melodic death metal elements in 2007, but due to being busy with other projects, it took almost a decade for the idea to fully bear fruit. Finally, in 2015, he recuited vocalist Melissa Bonny and guitarist Noé Schüpbach to complete the band. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/RAGE+OF+LIGHT">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
