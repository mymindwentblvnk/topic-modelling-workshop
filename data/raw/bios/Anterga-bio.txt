Anterga is a melodic metal band filled with a variety of influences from other styles (power, trash, symphonic, industrial, death). A balanced and refined mixture leading to a very original style the audience can't simply catalogue according to the more typical and commercial standards. Anterga sounds just like Anterga. The band was founded in Coruña (Galicia, Spain) by Juan Garcia and Jacobo Souto and up to now it's still settled in that city. Little by little new members arrived and, after a series of changes in the staff, Anterga is finally composed of: Juan García - guitars (ex-Sand Hammer, ex-Gates of Oblivion, Frozen Gaia, Mirrors of Tragedy)- Jacobo Souto - guitars, vocals and backing vocals (ex-Gates of Oblivion, Jacobo Y Los Despropósitos). Gabriel Meizoso - keyboards, vocals and backing vocals (Frozen Gaia, Mirrors of Tragedy, Awaken, Hissori Kaze, Universe of Dreams). Aitor Esteban - percussion (ex-Dreaming, Frozen Gaia). Mateo Blanco - bass guitar (ex-Costa Norte, Frozen Gaia). At this moment, the band has finished recordings for their first long play album, LIFE ITSELF, including 11 tracks and set to be released pretty soon. By the end of February the Galician Tour & Album Presentation will start. Meanwhile, Anterga members are already prepairing the second long play album and also a previous release (in EP format) in order to shorten the wait. The band wishes to thank all friends and fans for they have made this dream possible: "thank you all and we expect to continue spending great musical moments by your side, enjoying metal and the best atmosphere!".
