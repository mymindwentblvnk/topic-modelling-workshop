Directing Hand was a project of English drummer, percussionist and singer Alex Neilson that was active from 2005-8, after which he founded Scottish folk-rock group Trembling Bells. 

As one of the most accomplished and prolific drummers on the UK underground scene, having performed with Scatter, Bonnie 'Prince' Billy, Alisdair Roberts, Richard Youngs, Jandek, Lucky Luke and Tarpis Tauli, amongst others, for this project Neilson enlisted help from such like-minded compatriots as Christina Carter, Isobel Campbell, and Chris Hladowski (Scatter/Nalleâ€™s). 

At one point the Directing Hand line-up comprised Vinnie Blackwall on improvised vocals, cello, harp and harmonium and Neilson on drums and psaltry. Skilled in the art of ecstatic improvisation, Neilson and Blackwall produce free-psych-drone, delicate bubbling-noise, twisted folk, and the triumphal free jazz melodies of Albert Ayler. 

Another line-up comprised Neilson on drums and vocals, and soprano Lavinia Blackwall also on harp, cello and harmonium.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Directing+Hand">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
