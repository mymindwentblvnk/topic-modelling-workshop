Chroma Key is the brainchild of ex-Dream Theater keyboardist Kevin Moore. It takes the form of very mellow and slightly somber, fairly ambient experimental progressive rock and electronica, which is predominantly keyboard-centred, having practically no common characteristics with what Moore had done with Dream Theater.

Moore has released three albums as Chroma Key:
Dead Air for Radios (1998)
You Go Now (2000)
Graveyard Mountain Home (2004)

All Chroma Key releases have been self-produced and recorded in Moore's home studios, the locations of which change from album to album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Chroma+Key">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
