1) From each musical experience, Mart T. keeps the very core of it, in order to integrate it in the Dither's universe. His first attractions to heavy metal were used to build the iron skeleton which is the print of Dither: a heaviness born of powerfull breath and layers, of lucifugous loops and volatile whispers. From that one still remains a heavy floating, a paradoxal gravity, his tracks are the proof of a micro-electronic impregnation.

2) Dither, born and raised in the upper north of the Netherlands, started his career young of age. At the age of 15 he bought his first turntables and started of playing vinyl. He got the chance to play at some illegal parties and soon got recognized for his harder styles. After 2 years of dj'ing he decided this was not enough. He needed his own sound and style. With a simple studio set-up he started looking for that unique flavour. Combining bangin' industrial kicks with minimal/techno sounding percussion and smashing drum and bass snares, he found what he was looking for. His sets and tracks vary from slow industrial to drum and bass, crossbreed and beyond. Packed with a nice set of productions he already killed the dance floors at famous events like Club R_Aw (NL), MuSick(BE), Dominator Festival (NL) and Decibel Festival(NL). With EP's on Nekrolog1k/Agnost1k and Industrial Strength Records and more to come, Dither is one to watch out for!
