There are several bands with the name Driftwood.

1) From the Binghamton, New York, music scene, a band with a rock nâ€™ roll soul and a folk art mind. Carving out a name for themselves with electrifying live performances, they bring one of the most unique, raw sounds to the Americana/roots music scene. Incorporating upright bass, banjo, acoustic guitar, and violin, the ghost of traditional American folk music lives in their palette. But the melodies, the harmonies and the lyrics are something else entirely.

They have released three albums to date: "Rally Day" (2009), "A Rock & Roll Heart" (2011), and "Driftwood" (2013).

Their members were Chris Pitzel (Shroomunion, Still Life), Mark Rodgers (Shroomunion, Perilisium Cantos, Ribbon Fix, Ha! The Disco Ah!, The Devil's Own) and Melissa Mednick (Shroomunion)

3) A collaboration of three dutch producers: Ron van Kroonenburg, Thijs Ploegmakers, and Dirk Jans, the latter two comprising the trance group Shocksteady.
