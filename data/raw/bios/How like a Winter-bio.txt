How Like a Winter is a gothic doom metal band from Campobasso, Italy, formed in 1999. Every member has a stage name which is a word related somehow with the common themes of doom metal: Dust (vocals), Tragedy (vocals), Misery (vocals), Mist (guitar), Bane (bass) and Agony (violin).
They released a demo, "The Winter's Near", in 2001 and their full-length (and so far only) album, "...Beyond My Grey Wake", in 2003. 

Dust (aka Marco Benevento, currently involved with The Foreshadowing) has said that a new How Like a Winter album is a possibility. However, the band members live in different towns which makes getting together for rehearsal/practice very difficult. Thus the band's status is currently not known. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/How+Like+a+Winter">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
