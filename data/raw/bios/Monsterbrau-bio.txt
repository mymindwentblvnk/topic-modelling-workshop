Grindcore band from France.

Monsterbrau is the result of changes in several formations. The original members of the group are Constantino (guitar) and Guillaume (drums). The group began in 2005 in Roanne under a different name then several line-up changes have occurred, then most members did the same musical desires, which prompted the group to hire Remi (vocals) and Jo (bass ). With this training the group has taken a turn death / grind and started playing his 1st concert. It was also at that time that the first demo called Grind construction was completed. Then Jo had to leave the group for professional reasons and Nico has replaced it. So with this training that the group really starts to turn and then a new demo called simply Monsterbrau is recorded in 2009. During 2010, the group seeks to expand its repertoire and therefore hires Alex to guide his guitar style to a death more technical and less primitive and the first album.
