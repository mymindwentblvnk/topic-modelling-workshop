There are two bands called Dunwich: an Italian symphonic rock band and a Russian dark metal band.

1. The Italian Dunwich project was started in 1985 by Claudio Nigris, composer and keyboards player. Inspired by the tragic end of the town of Dunwich , the music tries to bring back those mystic and unique atmospheres through dark-metal sounds as well as classical instruments and on to ancient and uncommon ones.
Since the beginning the project took advantage of the friendly contributions of many talented musicians, and in this period of time Alessandro Vitanza (drums) has become a stable band element, until 1998.
The encounter with Katya Sanna in 1992 led to the formation of Dunwich as a trio of artists - Katya being part of the project until 1999.

The basic Dunwich trio, stable from 1992 to 1999, was supported by 40 other guest musicians who contributed through their art and knowledge of over 35 musical instruments, ancient and modern. Celtic atmospheres, symphonic orchestration, and epic-gothic memories taken from the darkest heavy-metal.

2004: Dunwich comes back after 5 years of silence, revolveing around the personalities of Claudio Nigris, Francesca "Elayne" Naccarelli, Roberto Fasciani and as always with the help of classical (choir, brass, strings...), medieval and celtic instruments. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dunwich">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
