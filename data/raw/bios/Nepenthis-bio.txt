Nepenthis is a music project from Munich, Germany. It was founded by Sebastian LÃ¶bbers (pianist for Waldwind) who is responsible for composition, lyrics, keyboard/piano, guitars, bass and vocals. Oliver Kaah plays drums as well as guitar and bass on some songs.

The music can be described as mystical and melancholic. The musical style varies immensely. Influences of doom/black metal, dubstep/electro, classical music, sadcore, acoustic music etc. can be found.

The debut album "Nocturne Moderne" was released in late spring 2013. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nepenthis">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
