Softer Still are an indie dream-pop band from Shepperton, Surrey consisting of Grant Williams (lead vocals/guitar), Ellie O'Shea (Bass), Alexander Williams (Guitar), Ollie Kitson (Drums).

They capture the modern dream-pop sound of the likes of Wild Nothing and Beach House combined with the classic indie pop sounds of The Cure and The Railway Children. The band are essentially a DIY project but manage to capture perfect blissful production from their own studio, located in a garage. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Softer+Still">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
