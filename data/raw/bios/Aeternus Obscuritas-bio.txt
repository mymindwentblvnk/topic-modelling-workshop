Aeternus Obscuritas was a Black Metal band from Sweden formed in 2004. A number of gigs were done but due to constant changing of drummers and bassplayers, nothing was released. Finally in autumn of 2005 they had a permanent drummer and bassplayer. In spring 2006 the demo "Legion of Darkness" was released. But the band was disbanded shortly thereafter. There was also a rehearsal recorded in the autumn of 2005 containing all four songs of the demo and a few covers. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Aeternus+Obscuritas">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
