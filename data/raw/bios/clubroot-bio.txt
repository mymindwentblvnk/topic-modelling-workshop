A St. Albans resident, Dan Richmond cut his teeth in the early part of this decade with material bearing a likeness to the futurist ideals of drum and bass producers like Optical, Ed Rush, and Nico. As dubstep began to develop its own musical language, its emerging low end sonic tropes and freedom from rhythmic clutter acted as the catalyst for Clubroot.

Mary Anne Hobbs commissioned a mix for her Radio 1 show, and the Electronic Explorations podcast has repeatedly featured his work. He is signed to Lo Dubs.
