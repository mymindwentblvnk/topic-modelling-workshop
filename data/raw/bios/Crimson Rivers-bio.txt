"Crimson Rivers" is a Symphonic / Dark female-fronted metal band, born at the end of March 2009. The founding members of the band are: Marios (Bass Guitar / Vocals), Thanos (Keyboards) and Fotis (Guitars). After some changes in their line-up (former members: Cleopatra and Ilias), in September 2010, Stella (Vocals) and Makis (Drums) were welcomed to join the rest of the band. At the end of November 2010 they released their first demo titled “In Life’s Silence” including two tracks: “In Life’s Silence” and “Funeral”. At the end of December 2010, they started the recordings for their first album “Sorrowful Hell” at BPM Studio. A few months later the whole process was finished and finally in May 2011 they self-released the album which has received many reviews from Greece and abroad! Now they are ready for future gigs and festivals to promote their crimson music! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Crimson+Rivers">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
