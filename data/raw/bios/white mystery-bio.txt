   White Mystery is the two-piece brother/sister duo of Miss Alex White and Francis White. If you're a fan of stripped down garage rock, loud drums, and/or redheads, meet your perfect match. Alex is best known as the guitar rockin' front women of Miss Alex White and the Red Orchestra on In the Red Records, and with her latest venture she strips it down to a guitar and heavy-handed drum garage rock sound. The twosome put on an energetic show, and their ChicaGoGo appearance boasts "the most killer tambourine and guitar rock out" on local television according to Gapers Block. Their limited edition HoZac Hook Up Club single debut "Power Glove" is already sold out, and a full length album is on the way.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/White+Mystery">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
