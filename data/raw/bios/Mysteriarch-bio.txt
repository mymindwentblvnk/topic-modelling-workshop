Mysteriarch was formed in Charlotte, NC in 2002. Drawing inspiration from the occult, as well as humanity's mystery traditions and the hidden aspects of existence, they wasted little time establishing a powerful and unique style of black metal. The band's first EP “Renaissance of the Maelstrom” was recorded in 2004, although it was only distrubuted privately among friends.

After several years of extensive gigging and line-up changes, the band's debut full-length album “The Majestic Fall” was released through underground label Ophiucus Records and received some decent press reviews.

In December 2011, their debut full-length and EP were re-released through U.S. label Razed Soul Productions (available for the first time on professional replicated CD). Shortly afterward, in January 2012 their 2nd full-length album "Mournful Embrace of Aeons" was released through Razed Soul Prod. via 6-panel digipak (limited to 1000 copies) along with a special edition poster.

Mysteriarch have shared the stage with bands such as: Absu (USA), Blood Red Throne (Nor), Grave (Swe), Chthonic (Twn), Epica (Neth), Mayhem (Nor), Rotting Christ (Grc), Sothis (USA) and many more.
