The band was formed in January 2013 by Liubomir Kabakov – Guitar & Vocals (ex Nameless Empty Faces), Teodor Dimitrov – Gutar (ex Nameless Empty Faces), Nikolay Stoichkov – Bass and Back Vocals (ex Nameless Empty Faces) and Hristo Micev – Drums.
The music of Tears In My Blood is inspired by the Swedish Melodic Death Metal scene, the American NWOAHM scene from bands such as Slipknot, Five Finger Death Punch, In Flames and others. After a year of practicing together the band and the drummer Hristo parted their ways and since then the band has changed a few drummers. The session drummer that helped the band to record their debut album has the nickname “Iron Man”, but unfortunately he did not have the time to become a permanent member therefore he remained anonymous. 
The debut album “Fighting Myself”, which was released on 22.04.2016, contains 11 songs - Intro, So Many Faces, Killing The (Important) Man, The Еnd, Blinded Eyes, If I Could Tell You, Misguided, Let Them Scream For Mercy, In Consciousness And Prepare, Same ,Outro. 
The album was recorded in the Delusional Thoughts studio in Sofia, Bulgaria in the last 3 months of 2015. It was mixed by the guitarist and vocalist Liubo. The lyrics of the songs are a mirror of the hard and emotional moments which were experienced by the band members. This is why the title of the album is “Fighting Myself”. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tears+In+My+Blood">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
