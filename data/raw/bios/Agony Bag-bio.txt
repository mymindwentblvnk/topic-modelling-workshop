Agony Bag was a band formed in early 1976 when flautist and saxophonist Clive Jones, who had been in Black Widow from its beginning to its demise, approached the original Black Widow drummer Clive Box (better known as Bok) with the idea of forming a new band. Bok had played in both Pesky Gee! and the original Black Widow with Clive and both featured on the seminal Black Widow album, "Sacrifice".
In fact, it was Bok who had been the moving force behind Black Widow's direction and presentation, which gave rise to their infamous satanic stage show.
