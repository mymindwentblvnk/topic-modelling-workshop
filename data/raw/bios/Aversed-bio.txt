AVERSED; formed in the summer of 2009, a Lexington based extreme melodic metal ensemble. Sungwoo Jeong(guitars/writer/vox), Martin Epstein(bass guitars) and Matthew Cheng(ex guitars) began covering their favorite bands like Opeth and Metallica and quickly started writing their own amalgamation of extreme melodic metal. To complete the lineup, they brought Erik Landskov(drums/percussion), constructing Aversed to be what it is today. 

Aversed will tear up every venue they play. With guitarist Sungwoo's devastating shreds, bassist Martin's trembling rhythms and drummer Erik's pounding blast beats, they will take no prisoners on stage.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/aversed">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
