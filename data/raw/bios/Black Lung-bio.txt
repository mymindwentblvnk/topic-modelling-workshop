6) Black Lung is a heavy psychedelic, stoner metal, doom blues band from Baltimore, MD. In the deadly cold winter of 2014, Black Lung emerges from the underbelly of the Baltimore music scene, to shock you back to life with unprecedented volume. A union of Adam Bufano and Elias Mays Schutzman (from The Flying Eyes) with multi-instrumental powerhouse Dave Cavalier, these three friends toe the line between sonic pain and psychedelic bliss. With influences ranging from the raw blues-rock of early Black Keys to the stoned out riffage of Sleep, Black Lung seeks to create a sound that is as heavy as it is soulful. Their self-titled EP drops June 3rd on Grimoire Records (US) and June 6th on Noisolution (EU).

Detailed biographies:

1) The first Black Lung album, 1994's Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars, was mostly composed of instrumental tracks taken from Snog's first album Lies Inc. and the Hey, Christian God single. A year later, the album was also released on Germany's Machinery Records as Silent Weapons for Silent Wars, although Thrussell disowned this release due to the incorrect title, changes made to the artwork, and the fact that the tracks were in the wrong order, destroying the album's continuity. Several more albums followed in subsequent years, eventually outpacing the number of albums Thrussell was releasing as Snog.
In 1999, Thrussell collaborated with John Sellekaers from Xingu Hill to produce the 10" EP The Andronechron Incident, purportedly a soundtrack for an obscure Italian science fiction film. A full-length CD of the same title, containing many more additional tracks, was released in 2002.
Thematically, Thrussell has used the project as an opportunity to indulge his fascination with conspiracy theories, with many album and track titles being references to conspiracies, such as Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars or RHIC EDOM. The albums' liner notes frequently contain essays on various esoteric subjects, excerpted from conspiracy books or written by Thrussell himself.
Since 1999, nearly all Black Lung releases have been on German industrial label Ant-Zen. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Black+Lung">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
