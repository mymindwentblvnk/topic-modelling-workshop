Seven Witches is an American heavy metal band from New Jersey. The band was founded in 1998 by Jack Frost and Bobby Lucas

Seven Witches released a Demo-CD in 1998 which gave them a record deal with Massacre Records. The first two CDs Second War In Heaven and City Of Lost Souls featured vocalist Bobby L. Bobby Lucas was the one who named the band and wrote the lyrics with Jack Frost, Bobby Lucas left the band in 2000 and was replaced with Wade Black who left Crimson Glory for Seven Witches.

With Wade Black on vocals, the band recorded their 3rd Studio Album Xiled To Infinity And One. Wade Black left the band in 2002 and was replaced with James Rivera (Helstar). Bass Guitar player Billy Mez also left the band in 2002 and was replaced with the well known Joey Vera who has played in Fates Warning, Anthrax, and Armored Saint.

James Rivera gained huge success and recorded two albums with the band, Passage To The Other Side and Year Of The Witch. James left the band in 2005 to continue with his main project, Helstar.

In June, 2005, singer Alan Tecchio (most known for his work with the band Hades) joined Seven Witches and recorded their sixth studio album, Amped. Alan joined the band after singing on "Hell or High Water", a song for Jack Frost solo project. Frost, satisfied with Tecchio's vocals, asked him to join the band. Shortly after that, Kevin Bolembach also joined as Seven Witches' new bass player. Kevin and Alan had played together in Non-Fiction from 1991 to 1996.

Seven Witches released "Deadly Sins" in 2007. Former bass player Joey Vera mixed the album.

To celebrate the band's 10th anniversary, Seven Witches has reunited with vocalist James Rivera for a tour and a new album that is expected to be released sometime in 2009.
