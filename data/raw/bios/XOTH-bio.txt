In the year 2014, four musicians from different regions of North America came together in the Pacific Northwest to create XOTH, a band that captured their love of space, science fiction, Lovecraftian horror, and most importantly Shred. Their first EP, Hostile Terraforming, was self-released in July 2014 and was immediately followed by a short West Coast tour with MOBILE DEATHCAMP. After the success of that musical adventure, XOTH has booked and promoted two more tours on their own, every time gaining more loyal fans who recognize their passion and genuine way of connecting with crowds on and off stage.

XOTH is:

Tyler Splurgis - Guitar & Lead Vocals
Woody Adler - Guitar & Vocals
Ben Bennett - Bass & Vocals
Jeremy Salvo - Drums
