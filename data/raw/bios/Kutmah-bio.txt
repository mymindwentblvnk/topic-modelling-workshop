Justin 'Kutmah' Mcnulty was born in Brighton, England to an Egyptian mother and Scottish father. Moving to the United States when he was twelve years old, Kutmah grew up in Hollywood, California and ultimately made a name for himself as a talented underground artist & DJ. Intrinsic member of eclectic Los Angeles-based music collective 'Dublab', in 2004 Kutmah launched the seminal club 'Sketchbook', which forged fundamental foots of the now-infamous LA beat scene. In Spring 2010 without advance warning nor any provoking criminal activity, armed US Federal agents entered Kutmah's home, incarcerated him for two months at a New Mexico detention center under immigration charges, and ultimately deported him to the UK where he currently resides. Since then Kutmah has toured Europe, playing shows with Saul Williams, The Gaslamp Killer, Flying Lotus, Gonjasufi, Dabrye and others. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kutmah">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
