Four Question Marks (also known as "????") was founded many years ago by Julien Granger (drums, also in Today Is the Day and Darkness Dynamite) and Remy Cuveillier (Guitars), and was joined by Yacine Mdarhri- Alaoui (bass guitar) and Francis Passini (vocals) in 2001.

Late 2001 "????" have entered studio to record 2 tracks : "Global" and "Weapontree" for the split CD "Feeding/Stroll/"????" ", which came out in January 2002. 

In 2003 Yacine (bass) left the band and Francis, who had to stop doing the vocals due to medical issue, take his place.

Early 2004 "????" enter the RBS studio (Sylvain Biguet) in order to record Aleph, their first album. The instruments are recorded while the band pursues its auditions for a vocalist.
After several tries, Sebastien L'aiguille joins the band and records his vocal parts in May 2004.
Aleph is mixed by Sylvain Biguet and mastered at "L'Autre Studio" by Jean Pierre Bouquet.
