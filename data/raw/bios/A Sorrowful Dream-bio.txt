Gathered in 1996 in Sapucaia do Sul/RS-Brasil - and based nowadays in Porto Alegre/RS-Brasil - A Sorrowful Dream intended from the start to present a different music influenced by the european heavy metal scene of that time, which was beggining to put together heavy elements of music along with delicated ones, mainly through the use of orchestrations and female vocals along with distorted guitars. Therefore ASD music sounds influenced by gothic/doom metal in addition to elements of death/black metal and experiments with classical music.

The band line-up has always counted on two electric guitars, bass, drums, keyboards, male vocals (clean and guturals) and female vocals (natural and classical) and more recently had the addition of a violin to its music, which adds up to seven musicians in the group: Éder(vocals), Josie(vocals), Jô(guitars), Lucas(guitars/violin), Mari(keyboards), Tuko(bass) and the guest drummer Mano. Althought the line-up has suffered several modifications during the existence of the band, ASD still conserves its first influences presenting a natural evolvement of its music, technics, execution and prodution.

Line-up:

- Éder (vocals)
