HEAVY METAL!! Two magic words would be enough to describe how pure and heartfelt is the goal from this Lisbon/Almada area six friends. But even the pure essences are more tham inner art and fearless creativity. ATTICK DEMONS are the full strengh of a style, proudly faced with the same attitude as they defy the power, the melody and the speed, just like the true spirit of the 80â€¦s. Back then, lies their main sources of inspiration, distilled today like it hasn't been heard in the Portuguese scene a long time ago.

Stay tuned for the release of the highly anticipated full-length album coming in 2011.
