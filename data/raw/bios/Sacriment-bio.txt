Sacriment was founded in 2005, in the town of Petawawa Ontario, when guitarists and founding members Mike Gagn√© and Bob Hollywood (long time friends and high school musicians) reunited after a two year college hiatus.

Bob and Mike moved to Ottawa Ontario in August 2006 and were joined by friend and original drummer Nick Lague. Vocalist Natasha Bartlett joined them shortly after and Sacriment started getting their first batch of songs ready. Sacriment was soon introduced to original bass player James Scott and they started their first wave of well-received shows. In very short order a loyal fan base developed and the band averaged two shows a month for twelve months straight.

Sacriment has performed with a wide variety of different accompanying acts and was invited to participate in a battle of the bands where they announced their dominating presence in the Ottawa Metal scene.

Drummer Chris Page-Manson joined Sacriment after several auditions were held to replace Nick who left to pursue his career. James also left the band at that time due to personal reasons. In preparation for their return to the stage, Sacriment rushed to Westworld Studio and spent four days recording their first full-length, self-titled album.

The time had arrived to fill the vacant bassist position and Scott Welton, one of Mike and Bob's long time friend, eagerly signed-up.

Sacriment is now ready to get back to business. Doing what they do best and where they do it best.
