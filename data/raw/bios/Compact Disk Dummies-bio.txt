Compact Disk Dummies is a Belgian electro-punk duo, consisting of two very young brothers (° 1993, 1995) with a penchant for experimentation, buzzing bass and screaming guitars. After starting in Desselgem, Belgium in 2010, becoming the winners of ‘Music Live’ and ‘Kunstbende’ in the same year and eventually winning Belgium's biggest rock contest 'Humo's Rock Rally' in 2012, they grew into a band with a strong live reputation, blowing any concert-goer away.
Their varying and bold sound has been heard at Laundry Day, Boomtown and Botanique and it does not stop there. 'Brutal, smack in the face, tons of charisma and something remarkably different', says Stijn Meuris.
