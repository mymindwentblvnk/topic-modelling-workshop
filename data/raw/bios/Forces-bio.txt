There are multiple artists named Forces:
1) FORCES  (Deathcore band) was formed in Detroit, MI by drummer Ronnie Lee Pasquale in 2015 after the demise of his Lansing, Mi based band, Sin Theorem, who enjoyed success as a National touring act. After moving back home to Detroit, Pasquale went about finding like minded people to help shape a new sound. Through a succession of musicians a solid band was formed with the goal of success in the national metal scene. Vocalist Colton Head joined early on along with guitarist Jonathan Hegg, followed by Dallas Berry on guitar and finally bassist Joey Mann.
