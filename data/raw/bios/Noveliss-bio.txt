Formerly known as J-Roc, Jarred Douglas of Detroit Hip Hop collective, Clear Soul Forces, takes on new solo moniker, Noveliss. After accomplishing certain milestones with CSF, Noveliss decided he wanted to give fans a piece of himself that they didn’t get to hear in the group. Having invested nearly eight years into his craft, and career, Noveliss is certainly no novice. Influenced by the greats such as Eminem, Black Thought, MF Doom, Nas, and Redman it’s no wonder the anime loving, video game playing, comic book reading, and pro wrestling emcee is well equipped with rhymes. His diverse taste, and unique hobbies, fused with his experiences living in the Motor City, surrounded by Hip hop makes Noveliss one-of-a-kind. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Noveliss">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
