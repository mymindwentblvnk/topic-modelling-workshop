lternative Metal made in italy! 
The italian underground lives! And this is exactly that what this quartett from Torino demonstrates with their debut album!

Alternative Metal not inferior to their combatants of the same genre from overseas! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ophydian">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
