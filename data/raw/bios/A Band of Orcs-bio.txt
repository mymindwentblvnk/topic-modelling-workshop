A Band of Orcs is the product of Gruesom Grimp's wicked sense of humor. He was out cruising this dimension of the multi-verse when he happened upon a group of kids playing role-playing games. The GM was about to roll for a random encounter. The Grimp feeling a tickle from his ma's side of the family (the gremlin side) thought it would be hella funny if the next encounter the GM rolled actually came through to this side and scared the living' bejeebees out of the gamers.

Player1: "Do we encounter anything?"

Player2: "Yeah, like ogres or somethin'?!?!?"

GM: "Let me see (sound of dice rolling)...you encounter...A BAND OF ORCS!!!!"

Poor kids.

The orcs pretty much slaughtered them, ending their pathetic little lives. But then, as fate (otherwise known as Mother Chaos) would have it, the GM's older brother was up stairs listening to some Slayer in his room.

The orcs ran upstairs, intending to mutilate the poor shmuck, but stood entranced by the demonic sounds of the lords of hell metal. The oRcs of the Gore-Stained Axe Tribe told Jed they would spare his life, if he showed them how to produce such evil, vile, primal sounds.

Jed, fearing for his life, took all the Orcs down to the local Guitar Mart, where the Orcs, of course, proceeded to tear through the store with their battle axes and...well, mostly break stuff...but they did manage to salvage some musical instruments and begin to learn how to play. Jed still lives on in the dungeon of oRc Tower as their music teacher!

The Grimp, always knows a golden opportunity to weave a mighty chaos in the Multi-verse when he sees it, so he signed on to be their manager and, like any evil overlord worth his salt, he plans on using the brute force of the oRcs' music to completely Dominate this frail human realm. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/A+Band+of+Orcs">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
