Omniversum is a progressive metal band, with electronic influences founded in 2010 in Kuopio, Finland. The five members come from various backgrounds which colors the music in a way that seems to appeal to all kinds of metal lovers. During the past 2 years the music has evolved into a mixture of heavy riffing, pounding groves and melodies sharp as a razorblade. It is uncertain what the future holds, but the past has shown there may be room for yet one more Finnish band in the world. Omniversum released their debut demo ”When The Lights Are Gone” in late 2011 and was given a warm welcome by the metal community and got the opportunity to play shows with bands such as Black Light Discipline and Noumena.

In early 2012 it was time to release the first official EP ”As The End Draws Near” to the public. Containing 6 tracks, the EP gave the band a major push onto the battlefield where the big boys fight. Omniversum had the honor of working with one of the best singers in the history of Finnish metal. Tommi ”Tuple” Salmela of Tarot fame, contributed with additional vocals on the first part of a two part concept track entitled ”Fatality pt.1: Deathwave”, which deals with the horrific tragedy that hit Japan in early 2011.
