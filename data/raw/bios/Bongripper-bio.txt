Bongripper is a four-piece Instrumental Sludge Metal band from Chicago, IL, United States. Since 2005, they have self-released seven recordings. Known for a deafening and intense live performance, the band thrives on an unrelenting sound that can compete with any of the heaviest Metal bands of their genre, covering a vast range of genres, from Noise, Drone Doom, and Dark Ambient to Post-Metal, their music stands out as a great example of Experimental Metal.

The band formed in 2005, when a simple jam session began the making of their first album, "The Great Barrier Reefer." Clocking in at 79 minutes and 23 seconds, The Great Barrier Reefer is a one track doom experimentation. The band released a very small amount of copies, and have yet to re-release the album since then.

In 2007, Bongripper released their second full-length album entitled, "Hippie KIller." The 10-track album has found its way into many stoner fans' libraries. Tracks such as Reefer Sutherland helped Hippie Killer receive a nomination for the stoner-sludge album of the year by Metalstorm.net.

Later in 2007, Bongripper released an experimental drone album entitled "Heroin." The album was packaged as a heroin kit, complete with a lighter, rubberband, and spoon. There were a very small number of these made, and they are nearly impossible to find today.

In 2008, Bongripper released their 3rd full-length album entitled, "Hate Ashbury." The album was split into 8 parts, and has been referred to as a "kick in the babymaker."

In 2009, Bongripper recorded their first collaboration with the Chicago noise band, Winters in Osaka. The release was called "Meat Ditch," and was a limited-edition 3" CD.

In 2010, Bongripper out-did themselves with "Satan Worshipping Doom." Their 4th full-length was released on vinyl as a double LP, and sold out of its original pressing in less than two weeks. The re-press sold out just as quick, and has since received tons of praise all over the internet. Roadburn.com named Satan Worshipping Doom as one of the Top 10 Albums of 2010.

In 2011, Bongripper released a 7" entitled, "Sex Tape / Snuff Film."

In 2012, Bongripper released  "Live at Roadburn 2012" as well as a spilt album with Hate called "Bongripper//Hate split".
