PERDITIONIST:: Perditionist is an all original metal band from Hibiscus coast just north of Auckland, formed in early 2007 by Nik Davies, Carlos Green and Ash Niklin.Influenced by all the elements of the metal genre, Perditionist truly has a powerful delivery. Originally they were just a bunch of dudes jamming out in the lounge and had no idea of what was to come, after demand for shows they decided to start taking things seriously and getting out there and were even asked to headline their first gig. Within a year and a half of gigging they had played with great bands such as Nile(USA), Hate Eternal(USA), New Zealand bands such as Tainted, Subtract, Just one fix etc.Their first single 'Existence Devoured' has had constant radioplay on radio stations such as 'The kiwi Metal Bar, Metal after dark, and bfm's Hard fast and heavyshow, They have made the music video for this track with Black Nectar Films(videos for 'Massive Attack,Bjork etc.) scheduled to be released in the near future. it's easy to see the reputation of this band is quickly expanding. These guys are never shy and definitely never boring, they are full on with their technical style of playing, have a continuously growing fan base, their playing is as tight as ever and with their active and energetic stage presence they share their ferocious energy with the crowd every time. Watch out out for these punishing metal heads as they will be getting in there much more as they are all dedicated to what they do and take it seriously. Expect to see Perditionist tear it up at a venue near you very soon! "They will tear you a new a$$hole, thats for sure!"
