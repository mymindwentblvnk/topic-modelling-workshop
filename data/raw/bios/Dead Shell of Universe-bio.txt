Dead Shell of Universe is a black metal band [with a strong doom metal influence] hailing from Pančevo/Belgrade, Serbia. The band was formed in 2006 and recorded an EP entitled 'Tamo gde pupoljak vene...tamo je moje seme' released by Eichenwald Industries in the year of 2008. 

Other than in their music, Dead Shell of Universe also excels in very distinctive esoteric lyrics [written in their native Serbian language] which strongly express their own philosophical system as a result of their interpretations of the phenomenological, nihilistic, chaosophical and many other schools of thought.

This is how the band describe themselves:

'We are not content and we are not a form. We are not the sense and we are not the order. We are not the matter, but the Antithesis liberated of context! We are the intention and methodology of the human mind collapse followed by the constitution of a pure metaphysical Xaos. We are not about to create a meaning, but to exile the existing ones by crushing the mankind’s intersubjective world concept. The corroding process of man’s order procreating demands, after which he begins to manifest Hell as his being; the reborn reflexivity between the essence and the being, between the mind and its diabolical manifestation, a synthesis and creation of the entity that is so strong, powerful and individual in its nihilistic solitude, enough to leave its intruded Nomos and harvest the fruits of naked Gnosis, freed of the mankind’s concepts of world and order, by the darkest force that stands beyond any institutionalized ideological system of values and beliefs!

Sourcing from the deepest dungeons of Cosmos, born through Blackest Holes, we are the force of and the Dead Shell of Universe!' <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dead+Shell+of+Universe">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
