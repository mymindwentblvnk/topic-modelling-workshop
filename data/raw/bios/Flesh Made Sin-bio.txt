Flesh Made Sin is a melodic death metal/thrash metal band from Tilburg, North Brabant (Netherlands).

In June 1999 FLESH MADE SIN is formed by Bjorn (guitars) and Twan (guitars & vo-kills) and soon Stip (bass) and Marco (drums) join in. They all shared the same goal and interest: 'oldschool Thrash Metal from the 80's'. In 1999 the first live performances take place. Flesh Made Sin is not for the slow and in May 2000 a mCD is recorded titled 'Scenery of Death' at Harrow Recording Studio (a.o. Asphyx & Occult). While the mCD receives good criticism worldwide Flesh Made Sin performs live with bands like Asphyx, Darkane, The Haunted, Occult, God Dethroned and many more. In May 2002 the band returns to Harrow Studio and records another mCD titled 'Masterwork in Blood' which shows a huge progression for sure! Even with this mCD a deal is not found, which surprises many people, since Flesh Made Sin is slowly becoming the Thrash scene's best kept secret! In May 2004 Karmageddon Media asks the band to join in as support on the Dismember / Callenish Circle mini-tour (Benelux) and the band and label stay in touch afterwards. While talking goes on both parties realise that they should really give it a go, which results in recording the first full-length album titled 'Dawn of the Stillborn', once again at Harrow Studio (June 2004). The great production of the album is done by Marc ter Braak. The artwork was in hands of Manuel Tinnemans (Pentacle & Necrophagia).  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Flesh+Made+Sin">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
