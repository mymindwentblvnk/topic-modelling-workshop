There are two artists who share the name 'Quan'.

1) Quan Yeomans (born1972 in Sydney, New South Wales), a member of Regurgitator, who released his solo debut album 'The Amateur', which was recorded in Hong Kong in late 2008 under the moniker 'Quan'.

Quan Yeomans is a musician best known for his work with Brisbane band Regurgitator, a multi-ARIA Music Award winning group which formed in Brisbane in December 1993. He was also part of a side project with his then partner, Janet English of Spiderbait, called Happyland. Quan also has a solo career and a side project from regurgitator with Sydney musician "Spod" called "Blox".

On 2nd November 2008 Yeomans launched a solo project with the release of his debut solo album Quan: The Amateur [1] which was recorded in Hong Kong, where he currently lives. The new project sees him tackle electronica and hip hop, while still keeping that kinetic energy synonymous with Regurgitator and his trademark postmodern lyricism and skeptical cynicism.

2) Don Ferquan (better known simply as Quan), who is an rapper formerly signed to Nas's Ill Will Records. He released his pre-debut album 'Walking Testimony' on Amalgam Digital in 2009.
