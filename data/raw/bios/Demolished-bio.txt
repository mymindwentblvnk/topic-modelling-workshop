Demolished was born in June 2005. At that time various people in the region wanted to play death metal. Numerous guitarists came together until Lowie & Raymond met in the grim and gloomy necropolis Peer (B). With Benny on drums, fate made them get drunk, go to  rehearsals and stick around. 
Wasting no time, Jeroen grunted his way in and takes on vocals. 
Demolished was left as an armed nuke radiating violence and aggression at various shows, without a bassplayer though. Basically this problem was waiting to be solved and in 2008 Jelle stormed the gates carrying his bass as a bloody axe, ready to get messy. 
In 2009 Demolished releases their long awaited debut album “Defleshing The Innocent”, and gets good reviews by both national & international press. 
Mid 2009 Sander blasts his way in and reenforces the ranks on drums. Jelle decided to leave the band mid 2010. Dries came along and brought a new technical attitude to the music. 
Demolished developed their own style of Death Metal, and with this line-up there is more violence and aggression on stage then ever before!!!

Early 2012 Jeroen and Demolished parted ways, we thank him for boosting the band to new levels. Now Mathijs Ignoul joins the ranks with his high pressure lungs to scream his way throughout the new upcoming album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/demolished">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
