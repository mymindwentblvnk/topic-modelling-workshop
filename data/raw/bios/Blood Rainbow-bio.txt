The band blood rainbow was founded by Adam Szalai (guttural vocals) and Florian Juhasz (lead / solo guitarist) in may 2002.
The main objective was to  create an extreme and melodic mixture within the death metal scene using the swedish and floridian styles.
First, we had to find such talented musicians in the hungarian scene, we could realize our ideas with.
Successfully, we found Endre Vigh (drums) in september 2002, Gergo Naray (rhythm guitarist) and Peter Krizsai (bass) in spring 2003.
