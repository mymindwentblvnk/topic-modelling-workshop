From the medieval and postmodern corners of Brussels come BRNS, a mesmerizing experiment in dusk, dance, and the fullness of sound. Like the dark-yet-vibrant images of Brussels artist Yardz, this quartet of talented multi-instrumentalists weaves together tunes that are mystical, moody and insatiably catchy. From the visceral and danceable 'Mexico', to the choir echoes turned pulsating anthem of 'Here Dead He Lies', BRNS is ceaseless in their ability to unfold haunting ambience into chest-pounding beats, and then back again. If you are a fan of anything from Animal Collective to Fugazi, allow BRNS access into your inner sanctum (and party playlist). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/BRNS">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
