It’s a cliché, but some bands do really deserve to be played loud. Ghost Outfit don’t just warrant that treatment, they absolutely demand it. The world isn’t short on raucous two piece outfits, but this duo stand out on merit with their energetic lo-fi masterpieces that have been played through the tinny speakers of influential bloggers the world over, but sound much more at home being blasted out in the flesh.

Previously knocking around as a quartet, they slimmed down and the tunes started pouring – rough, unclean but ridiculously fun. This is No Age channelled through the depths of a murky, industrial city – part genuine talent and part experimental reverie, but largely unapologetic, noisy brilliance that takes hold and refuses to let go. They’re a beast with many different sides, as unpredictable as they are brilliant, equally as likely to bash out the hook laden, grimy joy of ‘I was good when I was young’ as they are to make a collage of noise, masterfully knitted together. Their means are irrelevant – the end result is always one of the country’s most exciting new bands genuinely testing themselves and the boundaries of pop music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ghost+Outfit">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
