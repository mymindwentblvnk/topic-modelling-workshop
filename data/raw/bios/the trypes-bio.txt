The Trypes were a side project for members of The Feelies. Glenn Mercer and Bill Million joined the Trypes' founder John Baumgartner in 1982, since they left the Feelies aside for a period of time. In this band they also met the future Feelies members Brenda Sauter and Stan Demeski. The Trypes recorded a beautiful soft psychedelic EP in 1984: here woodwinds and keyboards are prominent compared to the Feelies' usual guitar-dominated sound. Included is a cover of The Beatles' "Love You To." The group evolved later into Speed the Plough. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Trypes">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
