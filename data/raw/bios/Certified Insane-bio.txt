Certified Insane was formed near Augsburg, Germany in January 2003 by vocalist Martin, drummer Blinki and guitarist Stefan.
After playing together a few months and surviving their first gig, they recorded their songs during a rehearsal with two microphones live in one session, which they released as their first demo CD-R called "session demo".
A few gigs later, Tom joined Certified Insane on bass in the beginning of 2004. With the new lineup, they worked on new songs and recorded it in their rehearsal room during July and August 2005. This new stuff was released by hmw-distribution (Japan) on a CD entitled "Raw, Crude ´N´ Relentless" in February 2006.
Unfortunately Tom had to leave the band for job-related reasons in July of the same year. Since this time it became very silent around Certified Insane with a lot of ups and downs within the band and personal matters.
During the next four years, while practicing pretty unsteady, they worked on new songs and tried to find a fourth member for the job on a second guitar and/or on bass, but this sadly never worked.
Now, in 2010, they are looking forward, what the future holds in store for Certified Insane... <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Certified+Insane">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
