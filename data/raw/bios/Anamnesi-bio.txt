Anamnesi is a one-man-metal band coming from Sardinia, Italy, active since 2009. The Project was formed by Emanuele Prandoni who is also part of many sardinian bands as official drummer or session drummer. The first and the second studio albums of Anamnesi were published by Naturmacht Productions and characterized by a classical black metal/ambient mood, then the third one "Erimanto" was in favour of a more italian black metal attitude.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Anamnesi">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
