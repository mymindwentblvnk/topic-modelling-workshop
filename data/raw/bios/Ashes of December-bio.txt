Ashes of December are a hardworking 5 piece metalcore outfit from Brisbane. For the last 2 and a half years they have been blazing away in the local and interstate scene, building a reputation as an up and coming act with their strong, high energy performances. Always being serious about what they do but never taking themselves too seriously, AOD are carving out a name as a band that always has fun... coining the phrase PARTY MOSH!!!!
