"The band MEMORIAL from Saar country has been founded in 1995 after a very alcoholic night. Back then they played pure Death Metal, two years later the first demo was recorded and after one more year the "Anxiety Dreams"­AP, which received very positive reactions.
Then it took them a few years until they recorded their first full album. I have it here and I have to admit, I am very impressed. MEMORIAL PARK hand out a killer­opener with an ease that is almost frightening. "The Skies Beyond" is the title and reminds me of a mix of IN FLAMES and DARK TRANQUILLITY in their early years!
But the album doesn't stay that straight, because they mix quite a few styles. Be it acoustic passages, clean vocals, female alto­soprano, bombastic keyboard­sequences, everything that Rock/Metal has to offer. But it works! The songs are complexly arranged, but still are quite catchy. Live the band works with drum­sequencers and computercontrolled keyboards, yes even samples, to re­produce the costly sound. I need to see them the next time, it's not THAT far away from their band­base. " <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Memorial+Park">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
