“Devil Riding Shotgun provides a badass medley of raw and almost sludgy sound, rhythm-wise song structures, classical Stoner groove and excellent vocal parts with almost perfect timbre. Oh, I've almost forgot their cool and filthy mindripping bluesy solos!” 
- Stillborn Messiah (10/17/10)

“Devil Riding Shotgun is loaded with bass-heavy grooves, standout solos, blues-tinged vocals and quality flow.”   
- The Obelisk (10/26/10)

“Devil Riding Shotgun are high on charismatic grooves and low on self-indulgent bullshit and that is exactly what makes this band so good.”  
- Doom Mantia (11/22/10)
