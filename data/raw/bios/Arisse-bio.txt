Total Thrash/ Death Metal played ARISSE from Rijeka, Croatia, born in the early 90`s. This band recorded only one demo, that was released in two different versions: one with English lyrics called "Nacht Traum" and one with Croatian lyrics with the title "Ritualno Klanje". Those guys were the first ones in Croatia, who came up with this NS stuff into Metal music and this in 94, which wasn`t so typical back then in the worldwide Metal scene. Moreover, the intro/ outro of the titletrack "Nacht Traum" consists of a speech of Adolf Hitler and through the song, you can hear the singer shouting "Sieg Heil". Also, the whole lyrics of this track are written in German and a short part of the German national hymn can be heard. Rumours say that Century Media wanted to sign ARISSE, but after listening to that song, they turned them their back. Nevertheless, they got very good reputation in Croatia and those excellent reviews in fanzines only prove this.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Arisse">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
