Daigo Hanada is a Japanese composer/pianist based in Tokyo and Berlin.

Thanks to his mother and grandmother who were koto players, he grew up with music surrounding him from an early age. During his childhood, Hanada was taught to play piano at a young age by Japanese pianist Akiko Takahashi.

In 2015, he moved to Berlin where he immersed in composing. His compositions are often built from broken pieces of improvisations. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/daigo+hanada">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
