Brett Gray, 24, is an American actor, singer and songwriter from Philadelphia, PA. Best known for his breakout role as Jamal Turner on Netflix’ coming-of-age comedy series ‘On My Block’.

Brett's foray into music was a natural progression, as he hails from the world of musical theater. In May 2018, Brett launched his music career with the release of his debut single 'Old Thing Back' described as "a sunshine-drenched slice of laid-back R&B" by NME.

In August 2018, he released his debut EP 'Easy Daze' which included five R&B tracks. He performed his unreleased single ‘Anxiety’ at New York Fashion Week Fall/Winter 2019. 

His single ‘Our Day’ is an anthem of hope and empowerment for young people to keep fighting through adversity. He wrote this song to give a voice to those who feel invisible, powerless and insignificant in this world. 

Brett’s latest project, Blue, released August 28, 2020. The EP consists of four R&B/Soul tracks, all of which showcase Brett’s talent as a songwriter, singer and performer. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Brett+Gray">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
