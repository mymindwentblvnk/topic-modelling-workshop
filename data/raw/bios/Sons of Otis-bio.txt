Sons Of Otis are a Stoner Doom Metal band, hailing from Toronto, Canada. They formed in 1992 as Otis, which they took from a character in the movie Henry: Portrait Of A Serial Killer. After their debut EP called Paid To Suffer in 1994, they changed their name to Sons Of Otis. They were signed to The Music Cartel, which ceased its activities in 2005. They are known for their trance-like neuron-firing live performances which included spinning lights and smoke machines.

After a lengthy hiatus, in April 2007 Sons of Otis released a split with Queen Elephantine on Concrete Lo-Fi Records.

After a long hold-up, their new album "Exiled" saw light in February 2009 via Small Stone Recordings. It features the two songs previously released on the Queen Elephantine Split, as well as four brand new tracks, and continues the tradition of their "Heavy psychedelic doom blues" (quote from the band's MySpace site).

Three years later, they finished "Seismic", again released on Small Stone.
