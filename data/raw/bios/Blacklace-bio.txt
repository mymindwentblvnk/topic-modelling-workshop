A Heavy Metal band from the USA (New York City) formed in 1982. They released 2 full-length albums, 1984's  Unlaced and 1985's  Get It While It's Hot.  The band initially split in 1987 and some members went on to form Damn Cheetah with a male singer & re-recorded ' Damn Cheater' by altering lyrics to the song in order to fit the new band name. Later, Blacklace reunited in July 2004.
