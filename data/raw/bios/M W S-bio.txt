M w S is a London based duo that was formed in Italy in 2013.

Their musical influences are Soul, R&B, Nu Soul artists as Erykah Badu, Lauryn Hill and Etta James. Their forthcoming EP ‘swim’ is a mix of Pop / Contemporary R&B / Nu Soul with lyrics that sometimes recall their home country.

Their sound is based on beats and samples that hold up minimal soul guitar riffs and a warm, jazzy and catchy voice. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/M+W+S">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
