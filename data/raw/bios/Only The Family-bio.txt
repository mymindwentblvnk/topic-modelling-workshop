Only The Family, often abbreviated as OTF, is a rap collective from Chicago, Illinois. The group was formed by rapper Lil Durk in 2010. Majority of the OTF members are also members of the gang Black Disciples Street's branch Only Trey Folks. The OTF label was part of French Montana's Coke Boys, and as a result, adopted the nickname 'OTF Coke Boys'. The label has since grown to be independent from the Coke Boys imprint and is now distributed by Alamo and Interscope Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Only+The+Family">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
