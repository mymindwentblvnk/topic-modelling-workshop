Sound Ogre (2000-2005) is the previous name of Vortech. The music varied between Heavy Metal (early works) and Progressive Industrial Metal (later works). The band was formed by Juha Untinen and Tero Konola in early 2000, and Samuli Tarvainen joined the band as a bassist for their live shows. Tero Konola left the band in fall 2005, and the band continued on as a one-man band. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sound+Ogre">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
