Seachange were a British band from Nottingham.  The band originally consisted of Dan Eastop (vocals), Adam Cormack (guitar), Dave Gray (guitar), James Vyner (bass), Simon Aldcroft (drums) and Johanna Woodnutt (violin). Johanna Woodnutt left the band in 2004 and she was replaced by Neil Wells (aka Line) who plays multiple instruments.

Their debut "Lay of the Land" was released in 2004 by Matador Records.  In 2006 their second album "On Fire, with Love" was released by the German label Glitterhouse. In 2007 Seachange recorded a farewell live album, also released by Glitterhouse, aptly titled 'Disband in Bonn'. The set, recorded at the Harmonie in Bonn, features songs from both their albums as well as B-sides and the previously unreleased 'Half A Love'. 
  

In March 2007 they announced to split up, leaving the stage after three full releases and two EPs.
