The Dead Weather is an alternative rock band that formed in Nashville, Tennessee, United States in 2009. They consist of Alison Mosshart (vocals, guitar), Dean Fertita (guitar, organ), Jack Lawrence (bass, drums) and Jack White (drums, vocals, guitar).

White produced their album, Horehound, which was released in the US on July 14th 2009. The album was recorded in three weeks at White's own Third Man Studio in Nashville. This group sparks particular interest because Jack White, well known for guitar skills, played drums with this band.. Whiteâ€™s last booking as a drummer was with the Detroit punk outfit Goober and the Peas, aged 19. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Dead+Weather">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
