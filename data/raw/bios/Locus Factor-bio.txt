Born in 2001 - this melodic death metal band is a side project for long-time friends Kris Norris (guitarist - Darkest Hour) and Corey Smoot (guitarist - GWAR). They eventually hired Nate Krishna, who happens to be the guitar tech for GWAR. Their 8 song lp - Between Saviors and Thieves, has been out since mid-2003.
