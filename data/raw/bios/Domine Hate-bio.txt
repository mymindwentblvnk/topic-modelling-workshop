It's in 2003 that Domine Hate was formed, it was just a solo project of the Guitarist/Vocal: Phil. In 2006, the line-up was completed by Geoffrey (Bass & Backing Vocals), Guillaume (Drums) and Laetitia (Guitar) and the shows began… In September 2007, the group released a MCD “Beyond the Hatred”, followed by a video clip in July 2008 for the song: “Kingdom Agony”. Domine Hate was the first band to have produced a video clip with a MCD! 2010 is the year of the change!!! with the leaving of Guillaume and Laetitia and the arrival of a new drummer in their ranks : Yohann.
