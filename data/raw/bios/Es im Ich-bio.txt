ES IM ICH is a german metal band, which was founded in 1994 by Thomas E. and Harald Z. They played togehter in a typical Heavy Metal band with english lyrics, but wanted to do something new. What they did in the end was Hardrock with german lyrics. Because of the lyrics, which showed the darker sides of life, they searched for a name for their band, which should be different than other bandnames. So they chosed ES IM ICH (IT IN I), which describes the personal-bad side of everyone. The Members were: Thomas E. (Guitar) Peter M. (Bass) Harald Z. (Drums) Peter M. (Vocals). Stefan C. joined the band in 1999 to do the vocals. Stefan C. could identify with the songs immediately, and he was a enrichment for the band. Then they released their first self-produced CD "Chaos der Sinne" (Chaos of senses). The first performance with their new singer in June 2001 was very positive. In 2003 they released their second CD "dem Wahnsinn nah" (near the madness). Peter M. left the band in 2006, and Stefan accepted the bass. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/es+im+ich">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
