Originally formed in 1997 in Lappeenranta, Finland by front man Kalle Lindberg and Guitarist Lasse Alander the gestation of The Republic of Desire as been one of steady evolution from a primitive industrial rock sound to the complex snarling beast that is the REALpolitik album.
Between ’97 and ’02 the band went through a number of line ups before finally recruiting ERK_Z on keyboards and recording their self financed album 2.0 Beta and the KVBER E.P., it was the KVBER E.P. that brought TROD to the attention of Ammonite Industries. The Republic of Desire has once again undergone line-up changes, ERK_S retiring from live duties to a more studio based role and the recruitment of second guitarist Arto Eskola. REALpolitik sees TROD continuing to perfect their caustic blend of metal brutality and synthetic grandeur.
