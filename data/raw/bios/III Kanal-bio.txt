III Kanal was a Croatian heavy metal band formed in 1979. The band's name translates to "third chanel" - III is "3" written in Roman numerals, so the band's name is not Ill Kanal, as it is written on some sites. They released one self-titled album in 1982 and another in 1983. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/III+Kanal">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
