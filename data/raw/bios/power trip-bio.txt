There is more than one artist with this name:

1) RIP Riley Gale. Formed in early 2008, POWER TRIP is a thrash metal band from Dallas, Texas in the vein of late 80's thrash metal. For fans of Exodus, Vio-Lence, later Cro-Mags, and Prong. Lockin' Out Records. http://www.facebook.com/powertriptx.  Their debut record Manifest Decimation was released on June 11, 2013 via Southern Lord Records. It was recorded in Hell by Satan himself, along with their sophomore album, Nightmare Logic, which was released February 24, 2017. Founding member and (beloved) vocalist Riley Gale passed away on August 24, 2020. RIP Riley Gale. 

2) Power Trip was a modern-oriented metal band from Karlovac, Croatia. The band was formed in the beginning of 2006 by Boris (drums) and Tomislav (guitar/vocals), after the disbandment of their former band Podrum. With a little luck on their side, they were joined by their two good friends Bruno (bass) and Jura (vocals) and started making music. In the beginning, their main influence was Pantera and similar metal bands (like Sepultura, BLS, Down, Damageplan…) so the music they played was based on groove-metal riffs and hardcore vocals. As the band developed, both as musicians and individuals, their view on music changed. Consisting of members with diverse and wide-ranged tastes in music, Power Trip’s goal is to synthesize and balance music which they enjoy in an energetic metal package. 

As of 2009, Power Trip is no longer active. It was the conclusion of the bandmembers that their interests and music proficiency have significantly changed in comparison to what Power Trip was all about. Therefore the decision was made to disband Power Trip as a band and an idea and move on to a more mature, complex and, all things considered, better project.
