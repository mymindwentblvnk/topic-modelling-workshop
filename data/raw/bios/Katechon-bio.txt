Katechon manifested late 2011 as means for creating raw esoteric metal, music without limitations. To be a vessel for our collective inspirations. These inspirations include old Death Metal, Black Metal, Modern classical music, Avantgarde and the darker side of Thrash Metal. There are also influences from western mysticsm, esoterism and the darker side of the psyche.
After some demo recordings and a few gigs, Katechon was signed by Nuclear War Now! Productions. 
The full lenght "Man, God, Giant" was released in june 2013. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Katechon">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
