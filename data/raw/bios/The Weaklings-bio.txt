Since 1994 The Weaklings have released three full-length records, a dozen singles and have had at least as many compilation appearances. They've had releases on labels too numerous to count, including: Junk, RAFR, Tee-Pee, Safety Pin, I-94 and National Dust all to great review. And, of course, The Weaklings "rock-n-roll owes me" is no exception. From the boogie-rock feel of Fit For A King and the alcohol-fueled Layin' Low Drinkin' to the Gary Glitter-esque On With The Show, "rock-n-roll owes me" explodes with the same high-energy Rock-N-F@..kin'-Roll these guys put into their live shows (minus the sweat, booze and panties). Their "Never Say Die!" attitude and dedication to the road has cost them several members over the years, but it has also earned them legions of fans. Be on the lookout for The Weaklings U.S. and European Tours; and if you're lucky, your town (we suggest you lock up your girlfriends and liquor cabinets).
So, pop the cork and put some records on...It's been far too long! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Weaklings">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
