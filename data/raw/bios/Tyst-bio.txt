Tyst is a danish band playing hymns in new and up-to-date jazz arrangements. 

Tyst released a christmas album in 2008 titled “Den Yndigste Rose” containing 10 traditional Danish Christmas hymns guaranteed to bring you authentic Danish Christmas spirit.

All though the musicians are young they are all very experienced and are working together with some of the best pop and jazz acts in Denmark including Outlandish, Breumm, Birk Storm and Oh Land. Tyst have in the past 4 years played a lot of concerts all over Denmark and even some shows in Germany to.
