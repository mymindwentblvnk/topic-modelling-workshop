The "real" Fastlane Flower started out in 2008 after the trio from Bodø, Norway - Chris Slettvoll, Marius Sommernes and Michael Johansen had gotten together again to play music, this time in Oslo, Norway's capital city.

In Oslo they used a good while to find the right people. They had to qualify to the trio's ambissions to make the band one of Norways most energic, honney-sweet and - as Hank von Hell nicely puts it; "the most pompous band" ...

In 2009 the crew was complete; Eline Stølan, Jan Tore Varne og Alexander Klæboe was now part of Fastlane Flower. Already the same year the plans for the debutealbum was made.

The Band was never in doubt, when this album was going to be made, it would be done right. Winter 2010 Fastlane Flower went into the doors of Propeller Music Division Stuidos and smelled the divine smell of norwegian music history. With them they had producent Hans A. Hornveth Jansen, and together they made magic.

Autumn 2010 Fastlane Flower signed with the record company Nordic Records and released their debutealbum "Deadline" 24.januar 2011. The album faced good critics in Norway and internationally. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fastlane+Flower">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
