Mena Brinno was formed after Marius and Katy were asked to prepare an acoustic set for their previous band's tour. In the process of developing this set, they discovered a musical compatibility that led to the creation of this band. Having played together, recorded together, and toured together for three years the transition was very natural to starting their own group. They immediately began playing a live set of the acoustic versions of Mena Brinno songs and are currently playing with the full band. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mena+Brinno">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
