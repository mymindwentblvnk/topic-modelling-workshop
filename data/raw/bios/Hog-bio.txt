2.) They were the first word that came to mind.  "Their has to be a band named Hog." - Dusted Shoes Records, 2009
3.) Crusty hardcore band from Mexico.
4.) HOG is a metal band from Stockholm, founded in 2010.
The band combines bone-crunching guitar riffs, bludgeoning drums, distorted bass and guttural growls, but also incorporates melodic parts and clean vocals. The bold marriage of aggressive darkness and flickering light is what gives HOG's music it's distinct character.
In 2012, the band assumed a stable line-up, established their style of metal and began assembling a full, coherent setlist.
