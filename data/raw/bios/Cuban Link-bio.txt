Cuban Link (born Felix Delgado in Havana, Cuba in 1974) is a rapper best known for his former membership in the group Terror Squad, his friendship with Latin rapper Big Pun, and his problems with rapper Fat Joe.

In 1980 Cuban's father emigrated from Cuba to the United States, eventually settling in the New York City borough of the Bronx. Cuban Link quickly learned English, and was immediately infuenced by early hip-hop culture. Cuban began writing lyrics at the age of 15 and became friends with fellow Latin rappers Triple Seis and Big Punisher. Their friendship was close; in 1994 when Cuban Link was stabbed, he considered giving up rapping. Big Pun encouraged him, and convinced him to continue.

Bronx rapper Fat Joe soon recruited the three into the group Terror Squad, and began to make ripples in the New York hip-hop scene, receiving recognition from world-famous rappers like Nas, who quoted their lyrics back to them when they first met.

Cuban was first heard alongside Big Pun on the 1997 single "Off the Books", and made numerous appearances on Pun's platinum "Capital Punishment". He was also heard on the Terror Squad tracks "Bet Ya Man Can't" and "Tell Me What You Want".

When Big Pun died in 2000, Cuban released his first solo single, "Flowers For The Dead", as a tribute to Pun. It was shortly afterward that Cuban Link began disagreeing with Fat Joe on manegerial decisions and their infamous problem began.

Cuban Link's latest album Chain Reaction was released on the August 16, 2005, and features guest appearances from The Game, Jadakiss, and Mya. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cuban+Link">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
