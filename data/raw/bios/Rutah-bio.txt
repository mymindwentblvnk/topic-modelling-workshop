Rutah was formed the summer of 1999 by Beau Clemons, Pat Sullivan, Erik Loss and Ian Sullivan. Influenced by extreme metal bands such as MORBID ANGEL, EMPEROR, and SLAYER, set out to forge the old sounds of the best, with the brutality of today... Rutah has played many shows over the years with a variety of metal acts, local and international. Lyrically inspired by the darker, more sinister elements of humanity, the songs range from the unrest of our times to hypocrisies of the religious right. In the fall of 2003, Rutah went thru a lineup change, replacing Beau Clemons for Cassidy Kleinman on drums and also adding Mark Pettit on lead guitar. Summer of 2005 Ian Sullivan left to persue other interests followed shortly after by our newest addition Shawn Striebel on lead guitar adding a whole new demension to Rutah . With new blood and a will to destroy, Rutah continues to divide and conquer!
