Starset is an American alternative rock band from Columbus, OH formed by Dustin Bates, lead vocalist of Downplay.
The band released their debut album "Transmissions" on July 8, 2014 on Razor and Tie label. For the first week album sold more than 5,300 copies.  The album debuted at #49 in the Billboard 200. In addition to the Billboard 200 album hit in other charts. In the category "Hard Music" album debuted #5, "Rock" #15 and a "Digital" #24.

In the early hours of New Years Day 2013, a radio astronomer at the Allen Telescope Array in northern California discovered a mysterious signal emanating from a star within the Ophiuchus Constellation. 

Contained within the signal was a Message--of human origin--foretelling the details of man's imminent demise. The Message was brought to The Starset Society, who quickly realized the importance of its immediate publication. 

Risking extreme danger, The Starset Society commissioned a group of musicians and scientists to assist them in spreading the knowledge to a broader audience. This group became known simply as STARSET. 

Please hold. STARSET will begin the TRANSMISSION of the Message to the public shortly.
