Arctic Lake are an alt pop duo from London, England composed of vocalist Emma Foster and multi-instrumentalist producer Paul Holliman. 

Emma Foster and Paul Holliman met in 2012 while studying in London and formed Arctic Lake in 2014 through a shared desire to create music. Arctic Lake's sound has been described as "delectably dreamy alt-pop", and Mundane Mag noted their "ability to channel tightly-wound emotions and turn them into breathtaking, electromagnetic anthems"
