Rorcal sees the light in Geneva, Switzerland in 2006.

After four efforts between 2007 and 2008 and more than 100 shows all over Europe, 2010 is marked by the band’s fifth block: Heliogabalus. Highly acclaimed by the public and the critics, this one marks a radical change in the band’s music. Obsessively dark and heavy, this 70 minutes monolithic piece sees Rorcal sink deeper into the abysses of sound.

After touring all over Europe and working on a couple of collaborative releases, Rorcal is now ready with a brand new set entitled Világvége. You have no idea what to expect.

Somewhere between drone, doom and black metal, let yourself go into the bowels of the whale.

Bruno - bass
Diogo - guitars
JP - guitars
Ron - drums
Yonni - vocals
