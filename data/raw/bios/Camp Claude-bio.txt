Behind this mysterious name hides a cosmopolitan and transgenerational electro-pop trio. At the microphone, Diane Sagnier, a young photographer who has mainly worked in the fashion world but also author of photo shoots for groups and artists such as Metronomy or Melody's Echo Chamber (whose photo of the cover of the self-titled album).

The young artist has always had musical inclinations that she put into practice after crossing paths, in 2013, with Swedish Leo Hellden and Englishman Mike Giffts of the group Tristesse Contemporaine. Camp Claude was born! Evanescent and hedonistic with a hint of nostalgia, their music sounds like an Indian summer. Barely electro pop, reminiscent of the 80s, but above all carried by the disturbing voice of Diane, between Lana Del Rey and Beth Gibbons. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Camp+Claude">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
