Founded in 2005 by Jonas Nelhiebel (drums), Fabian Panzer (guitar) and Christian Simmerl (bass) under the moniker of Inner Aggression, the band was complemented that same year by vocalist Sebastian Panzer and completed by second guitarist Stephan Schafferhans in 2006. One year later, their self-released debut CD "Beginning Of An Inner War" arrived at the stores. Having promoted the album with countless gigs on the national underground scene, the recording of their second album, "Lebenslinie", and a contract with Drakkar followed in late 2008.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Akrea">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
