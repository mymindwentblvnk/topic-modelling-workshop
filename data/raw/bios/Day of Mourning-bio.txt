Friends start a metalcore band, travel and play a lot of shows, put out a bunch of records, members come and go, everyone starts to wear on each other's nerves: 3 years, 3 vans and 1 missing finger later....band breaks up.

Members went on to play in Slumlords; Blue Monday, No Warning, Pulling Teeth, In This Defiance, The Getaway, the ever-so elusive XCoalition Against ShaneX, and somewhere out there is a skid band (most likely in the Woodbridge area) with Jay's brother's guitar cabinets.
