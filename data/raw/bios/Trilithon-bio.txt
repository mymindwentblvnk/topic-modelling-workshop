Trilithon is a synthesizer project made by Huib Schippers in 1990. Huib has been making and producing music since 1984. His first success was cooperation with Edvin van der Laag which has resulted in Syntech project.

Huib can be credited as one of the forefathers of trance music although he referred to his music as "track house." He is noted as being the inspiration for mega-trance artists Astral Projection...which explains their remix of Trance Dance 128 on Another World. He also remixed with them: Astral Projection Vs. Trilthon on Burning Up (Oval Records - 2000). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Trilithon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
