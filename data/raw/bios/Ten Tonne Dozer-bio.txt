Formed in 2005, Ten Tonne Dozer are a resilient 5 member heavy rock unit who are based on the remote Shetland Islands, thus making them Britain’s most northern heavy rock band. The band’s members’ geographical origins and taste in music are extensive and varied making Ten Tonne Dozer rich in diversity, this is shown with great passion and skill through their high-octane original music. Ten Tonne Dozer have played numerous gigs dozering their way throughout Shetland and mainland UK, with their live shows having been described as ‘an overwhelming intense barrage of sound and visual exhibition’. What an awe inspiring mix of blood, sweat, broken strings, and sheep skulls. It paves the way for the beginning of an epic journey throughout the ages of dishevelled dirt mongering slovenly metal and down right filthy rock in Shetland. 

The age of dozering has arrived!
