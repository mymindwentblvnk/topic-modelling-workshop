Damcyan is a San Diego based Metal Act of Unbelievable Brutality, Death, And Destruction intent on enlightening the minds of the willing and destroying the stagnant minds of the weak. Bread for Dominating the existence of mankinds Filth and Greed, Abusing all mans faults. As a result, a new wave of Heavy Metal is hitting the SoCal music scene, inspired by early thrash and Europes more progressive styles of black metal, Damcyan integrates a combination of intense guitar riffs, high energy rhythms, fast heavy hitting drumming, dueling guitar and keyboard solos, with a black/thrash vocal. Originally formed in Santee, the band started with friends Matt Smith (Lead Guitar and Vocals) and Adam Young (Bass Guitar) who started jamming in early high school, soon recruiting childhood friend Steven Atkins (Rhythm Guitar) to fill in the sound with his second guitar. The band jammed for a bit, then in need of a drummer they picked up Sean Kattner(Drums) through a friend and began jamming together as “Mantra”. As time grew the band felt the need to expand their sound past traditional thrash metal and brought in the talent of David Correa, who not only completed the sound that is Damcyan but also gave to Damcyan it’s image through his dark artistry. Thus is Damcyan. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Damcyan">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
