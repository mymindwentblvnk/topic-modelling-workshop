TODAY WE RISE was brought into being by five musicians from Wuerzburg in 2006 to express their understanding of hardcore. TODAY WE RISE is more than just the name of a band: it comprises the unambiguous message of having an unforgettable evening together with the audience, of celebrating in a body and of simply having a good time.

Musically, TODAY WE RISE ranges between modern melodic HC, sing-alongs and mosh parts. It can be described as a mixture out of old school and new school you shouldnâ€™t miss.

In their short past the band had the honor to share stages with great bands such as Sick of it all, Madball, Stretch Arm Strong, Walls of Jericho, Heaven Shall Burn, Born from Pain,Teamkiller, Set your Goals, No Turning Back, Cataract, No Trigger or Settle The Score..

The members of TODAY WE RISE regard it as a reward to play their music on stage in order to convey themselves to the audience. Therefore they seize every chance they get to perform live and to celebrate with you; in your living room, as a support act, wherever you like!  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Today+We+Rise">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
