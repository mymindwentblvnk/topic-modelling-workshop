BLAAKYUM, a heavy metal band that hails from Beirut Lebanon. Currently a 4 piece band with major thrash metal influence as well as hard rock and classic rock. The mix of thrash music with melodic Deep Purple and Steve Vai like solos, and the high musicianship and depth of composition with clever and dark lyrics makes Blaakyum an original band with a traditional metal style.
Blaakyum originally started back in 1995 founded by Mr. Bassem Deaibess. With many major line up changes, and a single released back in 1998 Blaakyum lived a fast paced 5 years with extensive performances from big concert halls to small pubs. The band split at the beginning of 2001. At the end of 2007 the band was reformed and has taken Lebanon (and then London) by storm. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Blaakyum">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
