There is more than one artist by this name:

1. OUTSHINE (melodic, gothic rock/metal, Gothenburg, Sweden)
Outshine from Gothenburg, Sweden, is a heavy, melancholy, dark, hardrock/metal band with some grunge and gothic vibes. The band, or the concept of the band, was formed in the south of Sweden (Smålandsstenar/Gislaved) back in '95 by guitarist Jimmy Norberg.

The band started off more as a studio project and they recorded a few demos between '98-'04. An EP was recorded in '05 (Memories) that got great reviews, airtime in radio (USA, Sweden, France, etc) and got the band endorsements deals. The first full length album "Bad Things Always End Bad" was released in May '07.

Outshine now consists of founder Jimmy Norberg (guitar), Erlend Jegstad (vocals) and Fredrik Kretz (drums). Between '04-'09 the bass has been handled by Thomas Josefsson (Evocation), Simon Andersson (ex-Pain Of Salvation), Richard Martos (Urbandux), Fredrik Carlsson, David Malm and Per Stenbeck (Shifter).

4 US tours has taken place from 2006 until 2009 and Outshine released their 2nd album "Until We Are Dead" April 17th 2009. The album was recorded by Svein Jensen (M.A.N, Transport League, Hide The Knives, Sister Sin, Troublemakers etc) and mastered by Göran Finnberg (The Haunted, Opeth, Dark Tranquillity, In Flames etc) and has gotten great reviews in Swedish and European media.

1.The Beginning of Outshine Eric Allan Causey was performing as a solo artist, producing and writing for various artists when he heard the news that drummer Brian Geiger just left Crossfade. Having some mutual friends Eric tracked down Brian's number and made the call. Eric wanted to put a full band together and chose Brian to help him hand pick the players. With Eric’s songwriting ability and Brian’s experience in the music business it was sure to be a successful venture for both. Brian called in best friend Paul Hale to play guitar. Eric, Brian and Paul then spent about a year building what’s now known as “1728 Studios.” A modest studio that was built not with fancy equipment or a high end budget, but built with great heart, by brothers in arms with the one and only intention of digging deep into their souls and pulling out the feelings that now make up the 2009 OUTSHINE debut release. The band has recorded and produced their new release, managed and booked themselves. They have high hopes for the onslaught of US tours and number one billboard chart songs.

Eric Allan Causey - Lead Vocals, Guitar
