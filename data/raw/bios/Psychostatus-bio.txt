Psychostatus is a studio project formed only by Greg Murani that has been writing music for over 4 years and playing it for more than 8. As he said, he doesn't represent a band; the band is only him, a guitar and a recording studio. All other instruments are done by him, as well: drums are programmed by him, occasional keyboard. Everything that's composed and released already is only instrumental, so, everything's only in music, not in any vocal abilities yet. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Psychostatus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
