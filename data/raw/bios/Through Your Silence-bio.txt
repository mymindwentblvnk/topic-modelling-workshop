THROUGH YOUR SILENCE was born in 2002. In october of the same year three songs were recorded to be sent to labels, but few weeks later the experiment failed and the members decided to follow the other projects they were involved in. In late 2003 Marc, guitar player of TYS started writing new songs with friends Stefano Triolo (guitar) and Fabio Vignati (drums). The result was (and is) a melodic death metal assault in the vein of Dark Tranquillity, At The Gates, Carnal Forge, Arch Enemy, The Duskfall. After a debut show in October 2004 and an important line up change in november the band worked hard and recorded "Winter Came", debut minicd. In may 2005 another line up change: Stefano Triolo decided to leave the band. One week later Fabio Curci replaced him giving new strength to the sound of the band. From mid 2005 till now this very young but active band played lots of promotional shows across Europe, sharing the stage with: Deadlock, Fear My Thoughts, Infliction, Sudden Death, Illogicist, Bloody Sign, Coram Lethe, Overfaith, Stillbirth, The End Of Six Thousand Years, Abel Is Dying, Sky Turned Red, Hellwrath, Violent Devoties, Bleeding Eyes and many more.. 
Looking for a label the band is now beginning the recording of their first full lenght, that will be out in september 2006.
