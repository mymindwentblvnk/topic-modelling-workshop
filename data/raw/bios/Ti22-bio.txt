Phoenix based Ti22 provides a heavy metal punch to the face that has hints of old school influence but infuses today's metal music direction. Ti22 formed in May 2004 in a chance meeting of drummer Johnny Collier (a Kansas transplant) and guitarist Earl Leet (an AZ local) on a boat in the middle of Lake Havasu Arizona. In true heavy metal fashion it was about partying, chicks and mayhem. Their boats collided and Ti22 began. Ti22 influences in the old style include the likes of Black Sabbath and Led Zepplin. Their new influences include Black Label Society, Pantera, Ozzy Osbourne and Damage Plan.
The band consists of Johnny Collier drummer and vocals, 26, Christian Willing Bass 29, Earl Leet III guitars 27, Joey "the Philipino jukebox" Salvo vocals and guitar 24.

After Johnny and Earl met and realized they had a common musical bond, forming the band became the task. Joey and Earl had been friends since high school, and Earl had been giving Joey guitar lessons. Joey started sitting in on jam sessions and fit right in. Next was the task of finding a bass player. Several unlikely candidates auditioned, but in the end the bass came from closer to home. Earl'ls sister was dating a guy who played bass, but had never really done the band scene. Since the band needed a place to jam, and Chris had an empty garage, it started there. Chris was asked to sit in until a permanent bassist could be found. Chris turned out to be the one. He learned the songs and stuck. The guys realized they had a bond through family, friends and a love for metal that couldn't be argued. The next step was finding a singer. After months of auditions, Joey and Johnny decided to write some words and see what they could do. What they produced is what Ti22 is today.
