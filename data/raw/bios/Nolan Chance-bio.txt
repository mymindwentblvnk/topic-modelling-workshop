No matter where you go in the world today, you will not find a more talented and dynamic vocalist than Chuck Davis, formerly as Nolan Chance. His sing career dates back to his high school days in a suburb of Chicago ( La Grange , Illinois ) when he and a group of friends organized a " doowop " group, which quickly became very popular in the area.


From that fulfilling experience, needless to say, he decided to pursue a singing career which initially took him to the local Chicago nightcub circuit. From there, he has successfully worked with some of the top names in the business such as Curtis Mayfield, The Dells, Aretha Franklin, The Jackson 5, Gene Chandler, Chuck Jackson and The Dukays - to name a few.

His greatest asset is his ability to deliver a soulful ballad and equallly as skillful switch to an up-tempo tune in a manner which commands the listener's total involvement. This is demonstrated without a doubt in his moving renditions of the ballads "I'm So Proud" and " Still" ; then comes the rhythmic upbeat of "My Feelings" .

While recording with the Dukays, a local Chicago group, as lead singer, they hit the national chars twice. The survival of any entertainer is determination and talent, both of which Chuck Davis possesses; therefore, after the group broke up, he continued to record under the name Nolan Chance. His Superb style has been recorded on:
