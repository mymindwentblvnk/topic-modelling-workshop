Wurdulak is a Black Metal band from Norway, which was formed in 2000.
The lyrical themes are mainly about Gore, Putrefaction and Anti-Religion. Their last label was Coffin Records. 
An album with the name "Entrails of a Virgin" was supposed to be released in late 2003 on Coffin Records. Since nothing has happened, their status is questionable.
