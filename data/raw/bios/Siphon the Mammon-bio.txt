After rehearsing every day for an eon the constellation found themselves. They had witnessed death and deception. They fought within. They quarreled over cancelled rehearsals and changed the name of their infinite lives' work infinite times. Members were lost into void, only to be replaced.

From nowhere, the year of 2011 ripped open and took it's place among few, as SIPHON THE MAMMON emerged.

In 2010 we recorded the mini-album "Ruins", with four tracks, all available here. At the time we were called "Defiant", which we changed in 2011.

2012 - the world is about to end, some people say. More importantly, we will release a new album around summer. Progressive, faster, heavier, more dynamic.
