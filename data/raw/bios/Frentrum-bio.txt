The Frentrum formed in 1996, although some sources say he formed in 2013. Somebody else says he formed in 1992.

He rebuilt the Frentrum after severely damaging his previous band, Malanoctem. 
After achieving popularity thanks to his neverending spam on Facebook, he published a demo-tape, utilizing symbols, logos and visuals that he himself deemed ridiculous just some time before.

The demo has been subsequently reissued on CD format by the famous and renowned Land of Fog Records, although the Frentrum himself considers it a separate EP just to dilute his discography.

A 7" split with the italian black metal band Movimento d'Avanguardia Ermetico was published in 2015, but the band itself immediately regretted this, denying the very existence of this split.

The Frentrum says he's constantly working on his first full length, even though there are no news about it since August 2016.

Nowadays the Frentrum is collaborating only with people that don't know him on a personal level and he is about to do the facts, and even if he didn't do them, he's on the verge of doing them.
