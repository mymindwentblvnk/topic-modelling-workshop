Kudra Mata is a 4-piece, pounding metalcore band operating from the east of Holland. With pumping drums, killer guitars, brutal vocals and boosting bass, this sonic burst of energy can, if you wish, be described as a melodic rollercoaster ride mixed with heavy breakdowns which makes you want to ride it all over again. Speed, Mosh 'n Melody right in your face. Nothing more, nothing less. 

After a few line up changes, recording their new 2006-Demo called “This is my pledge”, lots of stage experience during their 5 years of metal mayhem (including shows with Maroon, NRA, Machinemade God and Cataract to name a few), a growing fanbase, and far advanced plans for a european clubtour, these guys show they're perfectly capable to spread their vision on one of life's primary necessities: http://www.kudramata.nl/Metalcore DeLuxe.

Karel Lenferink (vocals);
Tijmen Hobbel (guitar);
Glenn Groeneveld (bass); 
Mart Heunen (drums).
