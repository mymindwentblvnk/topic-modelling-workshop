Hometown: Mauldin, South Carolina
Black Hand Throne formed in late 2008. Comprised of Todd Holford and Bobby Coles. The band started writing material for what would become their first self titled CD. During the writing process they recruited long time friend and ex Manticore vocalist Denny Stone. After finishing a few songs Dan Barber joined the group to take on drum duties. All that was left was to find another guitar player. We called Guitarist Dustin Holliday (ex-Calus) Dustin joined the group and we started writing our 2nd album.. Dan left the band. After a series of drummers that did not work out. Harold Smith joined the band to take on drum duties. Black Hand Throne has now become a force to be reckoned with.
