Asedio were a neocrust band from A Coru√±a, Spain rooted in melodic death metal and very similar in nature to Ekkaia from whom they derived their instrumentation but went for a different approach to harsh vocals with no screamo influences. Formed in late 2006 they have recorded a self titled LP and a 7inch split with their mates Etacarinae. Nothing else was ever known or released by the band shortly afterwards, except for a compilation of all their songs from an unknown year. 

Asedio was:

Nelson - Guitar/Vocals
Hector - Guitar
Marcos - Bass
Marcos - Drum

Members of Asedio used to play in several bands such as Das Plague, Ekkaia, Nashgul and Black Panda. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Asedio">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
