Professor Fate is Mick Kenney's (Anaal Nathrakh, Exploder, Mistress, Fukpig) solo project that produces cinematic style music. 

It is a form of epic classical that fuses intertwined drumbeats with orchestral rock and electronic sounds. The music screams "soundtrack" in its every audible moment, with grand, sweeping soundscapes that inspire cinematic imagery even in the dark. The inferno presents you with a powerfully potent journey through the caverns of the underworld, Inspired by Dante Alighieri's book, 'The Divine Comedy'. 

Song writer Mick Kenney, who is also responsible for the underground notables Anaal Nathrakh / Exploder / Mistress, has over the years grown into a cult figure in the metal and rock community. Mick has worked with artists such as Attila Csihar (Mayhem) Shane Embury (Napalm Death) and Kris Rygg (Arcturus/Ulver) and has appeared on BBC radio and TV multiple times (Never mind the Buzzcocks, John Peel Sessions).
