Although Monolithic is categorized in the synthpop genre, the infusion of many other sub-genres of electronic music make Monolithic's music distinctive in the synthpop scene. Genres such as breakbeat, trance, ebm, techno, industrial, and downtempo can be found in the music of Monolithic. The music of Monolithic can be described as "intense", "meaningful", "emotional", and "powerful". Midihead is the sole mastermind behind the band, and can be found in the credits of music for remixes, TV, and motion picture trailers.

In January 2006, Midihead announced that he was canceling his then-upcoming Monolithic album Evil Behind Smiling Eyes to focus on other projects. The limited pre-release collection of MP3-format tracks remains available on the official site.
