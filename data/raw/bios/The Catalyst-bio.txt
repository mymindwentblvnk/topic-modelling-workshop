There are two bands with the name The Catalyst

1)  A band originally formed in Fairfax and now based out of Richmond, VA. 
They're best known for innovative style of music (somewhat of a blend of punk, grunge, and psychedelic jams), their dual drummers, and their extreme partying abilities.

2)  A band from Montreal, Canada which consists of guitarists G. McDonagh and Justin Deguire, bassist Mike Marino, drummer Teo Zamfir and vocalist Matt Bailie.  
The group’s unique brand of thrash metal fuses together elements of the genre’s founding fathers (Metallica, Testament, Megadeth, Pantera) and the current flag waivers (The Haunted, Fear Factory, Lamb Of God, Arch Enemy)
