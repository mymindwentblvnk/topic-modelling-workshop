1) Sugarplum Fairy is an indie rock band formed in Borlänge, Sweden in 1998. The two frontmen/singers, Victor and Carl Norén, are younger brothers to Mando Diao's singer Gustaf Norén. 

The music can be described as Swedish britpop, the band being very strongly influenced by Oasis and the The Beatles (to the point that you forget what band you're listening to). The name of the band comes from the song 'A Day In The Life' by The Beatles.

The band consists of:

- Kristian Gidlund: drums.
- Victor Norén: lead singing, tambourine, bass, guitars.
- Carl Norén: lead singer, guitars, harmonica.
- David Hebert: bass, organ, guitars.
- Jonas Carlson: lead guitar

The band released several demo's before they were contracted, in 2004. In that year, they released the EP 'Stay Young' and - later - the single 'Sweet Jackie'. It was the first single of their debut album, which was also released in 2004. The album ('Young and Armed') was also released in both Japan and Germany, where the band toured heavily, in early 2005. Two other singles, 'Sail Beyond Doubt' and 'Far Away From Man' from the album were also released in 2005.

In 2006, the band released the second album, 'First Round', First Minute'. The singles 'She/Last Chance' and 'Marigold' were also released that year. In 2007, the band only released the single 'Let Me Try', which was also included on the second album. 

In 2008 the band returned with a third album, of which 'The Escapologist' was the first single to be released. The album was named 'The Wild One' and also contained the singles 'Never Thought' and 'Bus Stop'. Both singles were also released in 2008.

The band has gained a lot of popularity in Germany. They're better known in Germany than in their home country, Sweden. The band has two official sites, from which one is in German.
