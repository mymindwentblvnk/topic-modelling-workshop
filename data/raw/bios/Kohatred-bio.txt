The quintet kohatred comes from Hesse in germany and started their career in 2006.
Despite several changes in the band, the guys didn't give up and present their first self-produced album "feel the silence" in 2007.
The mixture of driving riffs and melodic hooks, paired with hard shouts shows kohatreds' understanding of metalcore.
