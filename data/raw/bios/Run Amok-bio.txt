Run Amok is a four-piece outfit from Brisbane, Australia who describe themselves as "punk rock .. emphasis on the rock".  Initially formed by Jake Thomas and Dave Box in 2003 with some school friends as an excuse to get drunk and have fun, they hit the ground running for the first time in 2004 when former 4FS / loss4words bass player and singer Chris Pollock joined the band.  They recorded the 6-track EP "High Expectations" but were left standing when the producer quit shortly after recording, leaving them with raw tracks and no finished product.  Despite this setback, they continued playing shows in and around Brisbane.  In 2005 however, they parted ways with drummer Dave Stapylton due to differences in musical direction and soon after found Hayden Robins, also previously of 4FS and loss4words.

Shortly after, with the help of Bad Day Down, Forefold and Fat Man's Cleavage, they founded the Punk Alliance which gave them all the opportunity to get more exposure.  They continued to play shows, write more material and tour, and in early 2006, they mixed and produced "High Expectations" themselves, and are currently recording an as-yet unreleased album to be entitled "Close Your Eyes And Just Run".
