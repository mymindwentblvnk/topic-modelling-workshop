1) A dutch hardcore & trance producer.

2) CONTRAPTION is the one-person project of KNL. This digitally-based project is an ongoing experiment in fusing moods through varying styles of electronica, such as electro, drum n bass, industrial and breakbeat, always with a sleazy swagger, dirty beat and a passion for the inventive. The tracks are driven by the power of a tight, often complex, rhythm arrangement, supplemented by hookline leads, sharp-edged synths and emotive piano.
