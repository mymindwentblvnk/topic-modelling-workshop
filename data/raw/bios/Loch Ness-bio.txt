There’s many projects with the name “Loch Ness”:

1) Argentinian britpop band


2) Polish doom/heavy metal band formed in Lublin (Poland).


3) Also a black metal band from the USA, with lyrics about medieval times. One demo (Sampler), one EP (Legend om Skog), one full length album (Sæormur).


4) Also a progressive rock band from Brazil comprising  Roberto Reese (electric and vocal); Alexandre "Caph" (Grand Piano, Hammond Organ, TX 70, Polysix Synth, vocals); Claudio Cotia Barreto (Bass) e Ailton Sgon (Drums and percussion). It is an interesting album in quite a naive fashion. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Loch+Ness">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
