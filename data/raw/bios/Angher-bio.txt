ANGHER was basically a one man project started by cellist/guitarist Greg Korniluk shortly after he was invited to record/guest on the Apocalyptica album "Reflections". His goal was to create his own brand of cello fused metal.

Something drove Greg to find a way to incorporate such a powerful (and unlikely) instrument with guitar, which would force a fresh element into the somewhat stagnant scene. By late 2004 he had done just that, and Greg began writing what would become "Hidden Truth", ANGHER'S debut album.

Still, it became obvious shortly thereafter in early 2005 that in order to do this vision justice an entire band was necessary. So the hunt began, and after several months of intense musician research Greg decided to enlist the services of guitarist Thibault Abrial, bass player Hugo Coste and drummer Yves-Marie Lebert, thus forming the bands rock-solid base.

However, the group was not complete. It was apparent that forming a band and only featuring "guest singers" would limit the bands live possibilities and opportunities, and so the second search began. ANGHER needed a singer.

After several auditions, the band crossed paths with Brazilian singer Adriano Almeida, who possessed a powerful voice and a great attitude and enthusiasm - this completed the lineup.

The band now complete recorded "Hidden Truth" (Available NOW!), a combination CD/DVD featuring music that mixes cello, guitar and bass producing a powerful, heavy and UNIQUE sound that is simply: ANGHER <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Angher">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
