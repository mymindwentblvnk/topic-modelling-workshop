Funeral Hag are a Brighton, UK/Worthing, UK based band playing down-tempo, heavy music in a sludgecore/stoner/doom vein.  The band started as a solo project of guitarist Jon Hill in 2008.  He decided to take the band further and began recruiting members.  

At the start of 2009 those band members were found.  Jon recruited his workmate   (Sabazius) on 2nd guitar and Nev contacted his bandmate from Sabazius, Steve Patton (Sabazius), to take on bass duties.  Steve in turn contacted his ex-bandmate George Leaver to play drums and his friend from university Ian Montgomery AKA Monty (Headface) on vocals.  

After a few months of writing and rehearsing, Funeral Hag commenced gigging in April 2009 supporting Descent for their last show at The Peel, Kingston.  A Brighton debut supporting friends from the local metal scene Here There Be Monsters was soon to follow and Funeral Hag proved as popular in their home town as in Kingston.  The first demo has been recorded and is available for streaming and download from Last.FM, streaming on Myspace and Grooveshark and downloadable from several different hosts (see Myspace page for details).

Nev Taylor left Funeral Hag in October 2010, stating that he did not enjoy playing live and rehearsing and wanted to get back to songwriting.  Naturally, the band were sad to see him go but were all keen to continue exploring the Funeral Hag sound.  For now the band continue as a four piece, though it is possible another guitarist may be recruited at some point in the future.
