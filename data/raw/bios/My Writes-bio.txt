What started as goofy sessions in between school breaks among three classmates evolved into something that they've come to hold dear to their hearts with more and more jamming practices. It was only in June 2005 that the band started to kick into high gear with the arrival of Dhaniah who brought with her a style of writing and singing that continues to wow the bassist even today. The guitarist continues to humbly play his riffs with a certain smilish attitude that makes it hard not to smile back. The position of drummer has twice been vacated but is now filled by an individual so diverse in character and style that a whole new dimension has been added to the band's songwriting.

The band looks forward to the future with a sincere ambition to secure a place in the local music industry. They are thankful for what they have achieved so far yet know deep down that there is so much more that can be done to feed their passion and love for music.

Their debut EP entitled 'Peace, green lollipop' was released in June 2006.
