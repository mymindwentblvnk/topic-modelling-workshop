Princeton, West Virginia progressive death metal band. Established in 2001.  Founding members:  guitarists Jon  Fralick and Mark Masri  and drummer Matt Tote.  As the band evolved into DARKNESS REMAINS, vocalist Jeff Griffith and bassist Curtis Henson solidified the first lineup.

Tribunal Records issued the fall of 2001 debut album To Touch the Depths of Sorrow, after which Griffith took his leave. Follow up 'Lamia' arrived in mid-2002. In late summer 2004, Masri and Hensen left the band on good terms.

The group drew in ABYSMAL DEPTHS man Bob Chapman on guitar. Travis Cook, previous drummer of FALSE HOPE, offered his services on bass guitar. Cook switched instruments in order to join, but soon opted out as ex-RAYA member Erik Harvey took the spot, similarly trading in his normal role as a guitarist in order to provide low end for the band.  After extensive gigging, as well as writing a new full-length's worth of material, Darkness Remains decided to call it quits.  The members have since continued to write and produce music.   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Darkness+Remains">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
