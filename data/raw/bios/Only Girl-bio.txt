Only Girl is the name of more than one artist:
1) soul, R&B, pop, gospel
2) dark ambient

1) Only Girl is the pseudonym of South East Londoner Ellen Murphy; creating her own brand of soulful, understated pop, soaring with R&B/Gospel infused melodies.

Following much tastemaker blog coverage over the last 12 months and festival slots including The Great Escape & Glastonbury, Only Girl released her debut single ‘Feel It’ on Akira Records; climbing high in the most popular on hype machine and playing a sold out single launch show in London.
In 2014, long term collaborators Zero 7 released their single 'Take Me Away', & 'Colour of Spring' on their latest 'EP3', with plans to release more material this year.
Her new single Remains is due for release on 6th July, with a debut EP to follow and album planned for 2016.
