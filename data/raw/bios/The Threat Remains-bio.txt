BIOGRAPHY

The Threat Remains are a five-piece metalcore band hailing from Glasgow, Scotland.

The band started up late in 2004 and quickly established a following playing aggressive yet melodic metal, playing not only local shows but also touring the country. This hard work culminated in the self-released "Darkness Surrounds" album in 2006 with the help of Sonic Temple Recordings.

In 2007, the band parted ways with original vocalist Daniel Service and recruited ex-The Punchline Is Murder... and current Co-Exist vocalist Mark Fry to front the band. 

2009 will see the release of their second album "Doombringer", an album which shows a marked progression and departure from their earlier sound, leaning towards a heavier and more metalcore sound.

The Threat Remains have played with bands such as The Black Dahlia Murder, Eternal Lord, Misery Signals and Architects.
