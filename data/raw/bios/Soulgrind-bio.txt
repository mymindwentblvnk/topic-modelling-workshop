Soulgrind was born in 1992 in Finland as a melodic dark metal band playing very unique and intelligent metal. 

After a short existence, it got a deal from German based MMI Records (Autonomy Productions). The first release was 7“ EP titled Santa Sangre featuring unique dark industrial mixed to doom and black feelings. 

In 1994 the debut CD titled La Matanza, El Himno Pagano was released through the same label. Album featured much more complex and weird emotions and structures than the previous EP. 

The next effort, LADIT 1999 AD: BIHTTPOTB got even further. 74 minutes of extremely complex and orchestral structures mixed into black and doom music. Both albums were created at the studio during recordings and could be called extremely exprerimental ones. Unfortunately pour production didn´t give the albums what they deserved. 

A small European tour followed in 1995. Roope Latvala (Sinergy, Stone, Children Of Bodom) was a session guitarist on the tour. 

As the mastermind, Lord Heikkinen, has always been keen into dark past of Finland (Kouta on La Matanza... album etc.), he felt that there was time to make a concept album dealing with that matter. That was the now praised Whitsongs CD. For that album Soulgrind´s line-up got it´s solid base. Agathon on drums, Whisper Lilith on female vocals and Ceasar on screams. Whitsongs got ultimate reviews in Aardshock, Imhotep, Perkele etc. With that album Soulgrind gained the deal with Holy Records.

Soulgrind seeks inspiration from the Finnish myths & beliefs. Soulgrind is strongly influenced by Finnish poet Eino Leino. 

The last album titled "Pakana" (Pagan in Englidh) was released on Holy Records in 2007. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Soulgrind">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
