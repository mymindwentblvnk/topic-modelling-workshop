Marten Laciny (born 4 December 1982), better known by his stage name Marteria, is a German hip hop artist from Rostock.

His stage name is derived from his first name, and also the Latin word ‘materia’ meaning ‘matter’ or ‘substance’. He has met with success in Germany (his 2012 collaboration with Yasha and Miss Platnum, Lila Wolken, reached Number 1 in the German music charts) and the single Verstrahlt, featuring Yasha, was included in the console game FIFA 12.

His alternative stage name and alter ego is Marsimoto. Before his music career, he was a football player and male model.

At the age of 16, Marteria was a member of the hip-hop group Underdog Cru, signed to the label Posin Music. At 18, Marteria then signed his first solo contract with Punchline/SPV, and released his debut album. In 2002 he went as part of the Underdog Cru on a European tour with other British and German groups. A year before, in 2001, he performed as part of the Underdog Cru in the largest hip-hop and reggae festival in Europe, Splash!.

His debut album, Halloziehnation, was praised by the press, and the scene magazine Juice awarded 4 1/2 of 6 stars. He then released his second album Base Ventura. These two albums he released on the indie label Magnum12, where he laid the foundations for his current career. In late Autumn 2007 he signed a contract with the music publisher Nesola. In December 2007, under his other pseudonym Marsimoto, he accompanied Jan Delay as tour support. In spring 2008 he signed a label deal with Four Music (owned by Sony Music Entertainment). He also founded his own label called Green Berlin. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Marteria">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
