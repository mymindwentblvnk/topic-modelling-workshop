The New York trip-hop outfit Wax Poetic came together in 1997 under the reign of Turkish-born music guru Ilhan Ersahin. The group originated at the popular and now-defunct club Save the Robots, and consisted of a volatile group of musicians jamming together to create a heavy groove of drum 'n' bass blended with quick dance elements. Ersahin and company signed to Atlantic in the latter '90s and released their debut self-titled album Wax Poetic in June 2000. The group's music was featured in the film Belly during a montage evoking the vulnerability of the film's heroines. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wax+Poetic">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
