Cuckoolander is the eclectic electro-folk project of Holly Hardy, a multi-instrumentalist from Dorset, England. Hardy grew up in a musical family: Her mother was a professional backing vocalist, while her sisters had a band that they wouldn't let her join. Nevertheless, Hardy learned to play piano and drums and began writing songs at 15, finding inspiration in the forest surrounding her home as well as the concerts she attended with her mother. While studying music in college, she was particularly captivated by the jazz, funk and psych-rock albums she found in her mother's record collection. While touring as a session musician, Hardy began Cuckoolander as a bedroom recording project. In 2014, she supported the Libertines and released a self-titled debut EP. She also signed with the publishing company of production duo StarGate and, in 2015, released the Dimitri Tikovo√Ø-produced single "Mother Nature." Early in 2016 another single, "Beating Myself Up," arrived; produced by Rostam Batmanglij, the song was issued via Vroom Vroom, the boutique label of Charli XCX, for whom Hardy played drums on the road. Cuckoolander also worked with Nick Zinner and Daniel Ledinsky on a full-length album expected later in 2016. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/CuckooLander">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
