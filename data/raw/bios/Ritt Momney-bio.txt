Ritt Momney is the solo project of 20-year-old Salt Lake City native Jack Rutter.

Beginning as an indie rock band comprised of high school friends, the project became a personal outlet for Rutter after his bandmates left on Mormon missions and his girlfriend left for college. In his bedroom, he began writing, recording, and producing his upcoming debut LP, entitled “Her and All of My Friends,” in which Rutter grapples with loss, loneliness, and a drift away from Mormon culture. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/ritt+momney">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
