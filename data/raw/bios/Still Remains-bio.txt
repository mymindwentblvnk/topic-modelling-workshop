Still Remains is a melodic metalcore band from Grand Rapids, Michigan, signed to Roadrunner Records, who formed out of previous Grand Rapids based hardcore band Shades Of Amber and released their first EP in October 2003. Still Remains notably joined Welsh metal band Bullet For My Valentine, along with Hawthorne Heights and Aiden on the Kerrang XXV Tour as well as touring with Trivium, 3 Inches of Blood, and The Agony Scene in the UK for the 2005 Roadrage tour which saw the tour end at The Download Festival in Donnington.

Still Remains are known for their unique sound, by incorporating keyboards into American modern metal sounds, to create a distinct, euro-metal influence in their music.

As well as their early EPs, Still Remains have three releases to their name. "If Love Was Born to Die" was released in 2004 on Benchmark Records. "Of Love and Lunacy" was released in May 2005 on Roadrunner Records and their last album "The Serpent", Which was released July 31, 2007.

Still Remains broke up on March 25th, 2008 , telling their fans; "It’s been an amazing run but we are done for personal reasons. No we don’t hate each other or want to punch each other in the face. It’s just time for us to move on to different things in our lives", and thanking them for their continuing support.

In March 2011, the band reunited to play Haste The Day's farewell show in Indianapolis, Indiana. Two months later they announced that the reunion would be permanent. 

In March 2013 the band launched a Kickstarter campaign to help raise $15,000 to fund the completion of a new album. They raised nearly $20,000 in total and their third album "Ceasing to Breathe" was released on December 17th 2013. It was released independently and sold through their website and Facebook page.

The band do not currently have any plans to tour due to family commitments and lack of financial viability.
