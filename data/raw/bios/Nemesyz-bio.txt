"Listen…feel...dream…"

From The Netherlands, comes NeMesyz, a Symphonic Metal band which plays music in the way they want to play it, with no compromises and no boundaries to whatever they want to do!

Their music is a mixture between heavy metal and symphonic rock with progressive flourishes added in for good measure. The influences of the bandmembers range from The Offspring to Dream Theater to Jean Michel Jarre to The Foo Fighters and everything in between.

The foundation of NeMesyz lies with Joe Fabriek on drums and Stefan van Leeuwenstijn on Guitar & Backing Vocals who formed the band together in the year 2000. In 2006 Roland le Fèvre joined on synthesizer adding the next level of depth and atmosphere to the music. In 2009, Tom de Wit joined the band providing the voice, words and extra guitars needed. And after that Joey Klerkx joined the band to provide the bass. Tom and Joey left the band because of personal reasons. Currently we are busy with auditions for a singer and bass player, so if you're interested, let us know!

Currently NeMesyz is making preperations for the recording of their first album. The plans are to release this new album before the end of 2011. In the meantime they will surprise you with online releases and studio reports!
