Denis Montero and his friend started THE NEXXT in Russia. “We are very proud to be independent. It saves us from listening to what we ‘should and shouldn’t’ do, so we can be as creative as we want with our music." is their motto, but they have seemingly dissolved in the early 2000s and haven't made any new songs ever since.

Their songs are still available on their n1m page - http://www.numberonemusic.com/nexxt/ <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/NEXXT">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
