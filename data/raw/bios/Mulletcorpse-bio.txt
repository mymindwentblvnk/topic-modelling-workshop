Although possessing a slightly humorous name, London Ontario's Mulletcorpse is anything but a laughing matter.
Richard and Darryl began making music together in 2007 when they formed Terrorhorse. In the beginning the band became quite popular and started touring as much as possible. Against the will of its creators, Darryl was forced out of Terrorhorse due to internal struggles with another member of the band. Darryl's absence from the band was poorly received by fans and eventually caused the demise of the band. Through all the strife and disappointment Darryl and Richard remained close friends and continued writing music through the internet under the name Mulletcorpse. The recent but long overdue death of Terrorhorse opened the door for Mulletcorpse to become something real.

Fueled by frustration and determined to not be forced apart again, Darryl and Richard began their search for good, solid band mates. In April 2011 they began working with vastly experienced drummer Jason Longo (Blood of christ, Baptized in Blood) to write an album. Musical chemistry ensued, and Jason became a core member almost instantly.
