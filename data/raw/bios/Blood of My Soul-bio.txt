Blood Of My Soul was created on 1st April 2010, in Södertälje - Sweden. With members coming from different musical backgrounds within the heavy metal genre, they soon started to create a music that has been described by some as "a diabolical mix between Candlemass and Alice in Chains".

In August 2010 they released their first recordings, a self-titled home produced demo containing 4 tracks, that can be downloaded for free at their Bandcamp page.

The band is now preparing material to its second demo, due to be released at the beginning of 2011. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Blood+of+my+Soul">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
