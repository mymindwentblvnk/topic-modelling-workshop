Svartalvheim was formed by a chance encounter between two people outside of a Starbucks on a Saturday morning in 2008. 

Heavily influenced by British Doom Metal, two friends began tirelessly writing and recording music, quickly realizing that Symphonic Metal felt the most natural to them. This style is where they would firmly remain. 

Writing and releasing a 5 track demo in 2009, a full band was assembled and played one gig only to a mesmerized crowd before disbanding.  The band was voted in the top 20 metal acts in New Zealand that year, after only one demo and one gig. 

Not deterred by the lack of motivated musicians to take the project further, the band shrunk down once again to two friends who were more motivated than ever to take Svartalvheim further. In 2010 a 5 track digital release was made available for free download, and quickly the band began building an international following and rave reviews. 

With 2011 came the addition of a talented session drummer and keyboardist whose expertise would lift the sound of the band to a new level, and help push through a full-length release, Cosmic Sorrows, in July 2012. 

With striking classical motifs and fierce vocal delivery, Svartlavheim is poised to continue to write innovative and most importantly, EPIC music, with no plan on stopping.
