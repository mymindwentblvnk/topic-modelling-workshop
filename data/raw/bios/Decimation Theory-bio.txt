Decimation Theory hails from the southern bowels of Houston, Tx. DT started in 2003 and over years of hard work and line up changes have embarked on the journey to break out of the Houston scene.

Comprised of a wide variety of musical influences, DT's sound has a medium between melodic thrash and power metal as well as the dark, evil sounds of black and death metal. Equipped with powerful and developed guitar work, deep bass lines, swift and somehow pummeling drums, and finally strong vocal presence. DT strives for a driving force without sacrificing brutal creativity with a dash of heavy finesse. Originality comes from our repertoire of different musical backgrounds and passion for the metal nation.
