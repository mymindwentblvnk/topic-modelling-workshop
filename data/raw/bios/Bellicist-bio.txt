Bellicist is a technical death metal band from Missouri.  The band was formed in concept in 2001 by Michael Osborn, though the original demos he wrote and recorded for the project were never released and the band was put on hold.  In late 2006, Michael was playing in the now defunct technical death metal band Crushing Skulls (Los Angeles) with Brent Glover.  Crushing Skulls folded soon after and the duo officially started Bellicist with the intent of writing music challenging to the listener both musically, and lyrically.

After several years of setbacks, the debut album "The Eternal Recurrence" was recorded and subsequently released in August of 2011.  

As of 2014, the band is actively writing a follow up full length to their debut.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bellicist">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
