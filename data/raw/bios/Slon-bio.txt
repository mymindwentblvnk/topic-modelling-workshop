1) SLON are an Apocalyptic Deutschgrind band of Christian Kolf (Woburn House, Island, Valborg) and Patrick Schröder (Centaurus-A, Valborg). German fuck off-lyrics, in your face. The songs of their self-titled first EP have been written in five sessions in 2006 and were recorded one year later. In 2009 they recorded their second EP together with Angry Teng on vokillz. 

On March 21, 2012, SLON released the long-awaited SLON album, which features Angry Teng on the first half of the record. It's a split album with the new 6-song EP and the first EP, originally released as CD-R in 2007.

2) slon are from vienna, austria. after starting the band in 2007 they soon released an ep on the german cdr/netlabel 12rec. 2009 their debut album "antenne" will be released on valeot records.

their influences range from post-rock, math-rock and hardcore to experimental music. powerful instrumental rock songs or powerful collages of instrumental rock songs put together carefully: where many postrockbands often tend to let themselves float into monotony,slon constantly let their songs shift through various melodic and rhythmic parts; rather than having their music slowly evolve they keep the listener busy to follow the course of events.

members of slon are involved in various other projects and bands, including
tupolev, port-royal, primordial undermind and the werner kitzmueller trio.

current line-up:

andrei jafarau: guitar
bernhard baumann: guitar
alexandr vatagin: bass, electronics
