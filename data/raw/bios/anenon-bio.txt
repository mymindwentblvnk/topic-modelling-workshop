Los Angeles native Brian Allen Simon, professionally known as Anenon, incorporates electronic and acoustic instrumentation, including his own fluttering saxophone playing, into dreamy soundscapes which blend ambient music, jazz improvisation, modern composition, and abstract beats. Simon founded experimental imprint Non Projects in 2010; his split EP with frequent collaborator Asura (Ryan York) was one of the label's first releases. In 2011, Simon participated in the Red Bull Music Academy and remixed tracks by Take, Shlohmo, and yuk.
