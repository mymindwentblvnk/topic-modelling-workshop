1) A mainstream pop/rock band with hard rock and soul-influenced arrangements. Smith hit the Top Ten in 1969 with their drastically revised cover of the Shirelles' "Baby It's You." Featuring three lead singers and a B-3 Hammond organ, their strongest asset was their most frequent vocalist, Gayle McCormick, an accomplished female blue-eyed soul belter. Most of their material consisted of covers of popular rock and R&B tunes, and they broke up after a couple of albums. McCormick had a couple small hits in 1971, and made a few albums in the early '70s as a soloist.

2) Smith is also a D&B producer from Melbourne, Australia.

3) Smith makes beats for the soul. From Bristol, UK, having fun with I Hate Snakes! Records.
