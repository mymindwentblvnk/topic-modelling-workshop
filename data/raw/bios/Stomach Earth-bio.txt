"Black Market Activities presents the self-titled debut album by Stomach Earth, the solo project of The Red Chord guitarist and founder Mike "Gunface" McKenzie, set for a July 16th release. Massive, creeping death-doom of the underworld, Stomach Earth summons the vast void of early Godflesh and the morbid grandeur of early Cathedral, creating a new futuristic sound that is transfixing and heavy as hell.

Like a single wave swallowing a city, Stomach Earth wields maximum power through minimum means. Glacial tempos and minimal programmed drums allow for a clarity that absolutely devastates. McKenzie, known across the globe as a technical metal shredder, chooses instead with Stomach Earth to do his killing slowly and methodically. The results are awe-inspiring. Monolithic and glistening with cinematic sheen, Stomach Earth demands to be cranked to 11.

The sole mastermind behind Stomach Earth, McKenzie wrote all the album's music and lyrics, sang and played all the instruments. The self-recorded, self-mixed album was mastered by Nick Zampiello at New Alliance East." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/stomach+earth">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
