Formed in 2008 by drummer Brent Bell (ex-Spawned by Rot, ex-Butcher’d), Kryosphere played its first show opening for Dead Jesus in 2009. Kryosphere had been plagued by lineup changes through its early years, but has finally solidified an identity with Brent Bell on drums, Stephanie Bell on bass, Dave Waram and Derek Braun on guitars, and Davis Hay on vocals. The EP “At Six Feet” was released in 2011 with Scott Byrne and Kirt Kolach on guitars, and JP Blais on vocals.

Kryosphere, at its core, has always maintained strong connections with old-school Death Metal sound, while embracing the new ideas of their younger peers. In short, they are a modern death metal band that knows how to draw a crowd across the massive gulf of metal fans.

Great attention has been placed on song writing, and it shows on the new self-released EP, “SOL”. The uniquely structured music of “SOL” has memorable riffs that are often lacking in today’s metal. Soaring solos and powerful vocals accompany thick bang along sections, while thumping bass drives the overall feeling of every song. Inventive and technical drumming steer the band through multiple time changes and differing movements. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kryosphere">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
