"England's Stroke lay out a moody, sometimes menacing blend of hard rock-tinged industrial and trip-hop which relies mostly on electronic instrumentation for its impact. Yet the group has a sense of subtlety as well, never going so far over the top as to turn their darkness into a cartoonish caricature." - Steve Huey (All Music Guide) <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Stroke">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
