Internet Money is a Los Angeles-based music production collective and label founded by Taz Taylor. Members of the collective have produced for some of rap’s biggest names, including Drake, Juice WRLD, Trippie Redd, Lil Uzi Vert, XXXTENTACION, and many more.

The production members also run a YouTube channel by the same name, Internet Money, where they post beat-making videos, tracks, and general tips.

In October 2019, Internet Money signed a joint venture deal with TenThousand Projects, which now releases music for all of Internet Money’s artists. The first song released under this deal was “Somebody” with Lil Tecca and A Boogie wit da Hoodie, released October 11, 2019.
