Jon Auer is most well known for being one half of The Posies creative team, along with Ken Stringfellow. Auer's solo recordings demonstrate his considerable influence to the success of The Posies. In particular, SONGS FROM THE YEAR OF OUR DEMISE achieves new levels of melody and lyrical brilliance. The song "Bottom of the Bottle" will resonate with anyone who has dated someone who drinks a "little too much," and "Six Feet Under" may be one of the most depressing (yet cathartic) break-up songs ever written. SONGS FROM THE YEAR OF OUR DEMISE, BLOOD ON THE TRACKS, and SEA CHANGE are the holy trinity of break-up albums. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jon+Auer">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
