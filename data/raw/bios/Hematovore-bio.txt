Label Description: Tha Dirty Souf's instru-metal guitarmy! Hailing from the deepest, darkest jungles of the Bama Bible Belt, this 3-guitar slinging quintet breathes a vibrant breath of fresh air through the realm of instrumental metal, bridging the gaps between numerous subgenres while rocking the collective panty to the collective ankle. Leaving no musical stone unturned, their imaginative arrangements are densely packed with ideas...an encyclopedia of riffs ranging from the intricately complex to the irresistibly anthemic. Startlingly catchy but never coming off soft, Hematovore turns even the most jaded music fans' heads--whether they're sporting corpse paint, white belts, mohawks, or nerd glasses. Metalheads, hardcore purists, gutter punks, and indie rockers alike--Hematovore invites them all to the table, pats them on the back...and destroys them.
