Swedish Jenny Wilson makes elegant and sophisticated pop music with hints of synthpop. Her self-produced solo debut, Love & Youth, on which she also plays every instrument, was released to much critical acclaim in 2005. Music journalists ranked it as one of the best Swedish albums of the year.

As a teenager in the early 90s, Jenny Wilson - born in 1975 - originally wanted to become a writer. At that time she discovered PJ Harvey's Rid of Me, an album that inspired her so much that she decided to give up on her writing career and focus on music. She met Karl-Jonas Winqvist in 1997, with whom she formed the band First Floor Power. Per Lager and Jenny's sister, Sara, joined shortly after. Their debut album, There Is Hope was released in 2001.

In 2003, Jenny Wilson contributed on The Knife's hit "You Take My Breath Away". Her debut album Love & Youth was released on the Dreijer siblings' (The Knife) record company, Rabid Records. And her sophomore album, titled Hardships! was released in early 2009. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jenny+Wilson">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
