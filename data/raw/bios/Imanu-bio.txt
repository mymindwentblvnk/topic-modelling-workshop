Inspired and driven by the future of electronic music, its story-telling potential and ability to convey powerful emotions, IMANU is the brainchild of Rotterdam-based Jonathan Kievit. At the forefront of a new generation of producers, he rejects stuffy genre boundaries, rigid tempo expectations and DJ-friendly format formalities and just wants to create genuine emotional electronic music. Nothing more. Nothing less.  

Established late 2019, the IMANU project follows an already impressive chapter in drum & bass. Breaking through at the age of just 16 with a highly distinctive and technical brutalist style, he made a remarkable impression in a very short space of time. However, this was only a hint at what was to come. Now in his early 20s, IMANU has already been responsible for releases on significant labels such as VISION, Heaven Sent, UKF and mau5trap, he’s remixed the likes of Apashe, TOKiMONSTA and What So Not & Skrillex and already collaborated with fellow kindred, unclassifiable spirits like Sleepnet, Mefjus and Buunshin. Many more are expected to drop in due course. 

Each release joining more dots and weaving an indelible, emotional thread between every genre you can throw a pigeonhole at, IMANU is the culmination of everything that inspires Jonathan. Everything he’s achieved so far, everything he’s learnt and everything that moves him… But flipped in a much more personal and open-armed creative way that focuses purely on the future and where this music can be taken next… <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Imanu">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
