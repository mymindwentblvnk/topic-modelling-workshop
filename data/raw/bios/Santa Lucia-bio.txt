Santa Lucia, formed by a group of 12-year-old girls in Kemi, northern Finland, in 1984, was in many ways an unusual band in the rock scene of the time: they were one of the first acts to record heavy metal sung in Finnish, and its members were 16-year-old teenage girls when signing the record deal with Poko Records. 

The band operated from 1984 to 1992. Matti Riekki, the editor of Inferno magazine comments: “Every path has its pioneers and settlers, and in that sense, the pioneering work Santa Lucia did in the ’80s is not unique. What is unique, however, is that during the 27 years that have passed since the band’s demise, nobody has been able to tread a similar path. Santa Lucia’s combination of speed metalish backdrops, the gloom of post-punk, and keyboard-led melodies is still something not achieved or even attempted by other bands.” <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Santa+Lucia">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
