Formed in 2007 in Oulu, Finland, Atrum Tempestas is a stormy, yet tranquil trip into atmospheric black metal, drawing influences from styles like funeral doom and post-rock. Since its foundation in 2007, Atrum Tempestas' music has been shifting from deliberate minimalism to alluring soundscapes and from thoughtful examination to bursts of emotionally charged passages.

The first release, demo EP "Ne Deus crede" was originally set to be released in 2008, but the release was pushed further. It was eventually released in 2012. The band signed to Nordavind Records in 2014 and their first album, NÃ©ant, will be released on October 13th.
