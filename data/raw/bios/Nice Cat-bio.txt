In '97, three friends (Caitlin- lead guitar, Carol- vocals and guitar, Nicole- bass) decided to stop gawking at rock bands and start playing in one. With no prior experience, they recorded a demo, played anywhere they could, and burned through a half dozen drummers. Their anything-goes attitude sent them everywhere from boat cruises to weddings to rained out backwoods festivals. Nice Cat shows involve anything from audience participation on unfinished songs, to police shutdowns, to crowd demonstrations on how to Rock Out With Your Cock Out-- literally! 

Rage Against the Machine invited them to be openers at a Maple Leaf Gardens gig. They've played the indie stage at Toronto's gigantic annual Edgefest summer show. The Cats have also shared stages with: the Cult, Clutch, Biohazard, Nebula, Voivod, Candiria, Alabama Thunder Pussy, Burnt by the Sun, Karma to Burn, Sons of Otis, Bottom, and tons more. 

"Three Girls, Three Nights, Three Bottles," was recorded at Signal to Noise in Toronto, and mixed with Larry Packer/Uncle Punchy (Clutch) in Silver Springs MD. Two tracks feature Josh Freese (A Perfect Circle, the Vandals) on drums. Mick Schauer from Clutch contributes organ. Also included is Nice Cat's version of "Rat Race," a rarely heard gem from Tom Morello's high school band, the Electric Sheep. 

Nice Cat have plans to eat lots of sugar, make videos, and play as much as possible. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nice+Cat">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
