It all began in 1997 in Iggesund (Sweden). Benke was at the time already playing with two bands but realized only one made him satisfied. He started looking for new talented musicians to play with. He knew a guy named Thomas who played drums just for fun once in a while with his friend Simon (guitar/vocal). And so he asked them if they were interested to form a band.

They decided to give it a try so Benke left one of the bands of that time and we formed another, “Corrosive Sweden”. And yeah, it turned out to be an excellent formation. Johan continued with his evil guitar, Thomas with his drums as well but Simon grabbed the bass instead and both Johan and Simon became lead singers in the band. They made a couple of heavy songs which they later on had the opportunity to record in a studio a couple of miles away from our village. 

It all went well and Corrosive Sweden even got ourselves some gigs nearby. After a few years of making songs and recordings another man emerged. His name was Christer Ulander and was really anxious to participate the band. So his wishes came through... In the year 2000 he joined “Corrosive Sweden” as lead guitarist and his achievements towards the band were remarkable. The songs became more elevated than before... and... they still are! You can say that it all became more serious and the sound became more complete with two nasty guitars instead of one.
