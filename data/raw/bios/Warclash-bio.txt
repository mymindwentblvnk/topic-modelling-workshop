The founding of Warclash dates back to the summer of 2003 when Jaco Ket (rhythm guitar & vocals), Adis Mustafic (lead guitar) and Dirk McDaniel (Bass)wrote some songs and started jamming in Jaco’s basement.

Due to the fact that they couldn’t find a good drummer,
Warclash was left comatose. 
In 2004 Dirk left the band, because of the prospect of 
moving from Reeuwijk to Tilburg.

Warclash found a new bassist in Mattijs Frank, who took over in 2005, but was with three members, the band was missing a drummer nonetheless. Later that year, Jaco met Luc van den Bergen, who filled the spot behind the drums. 
Finally, the band was complete.
However, Adis had to leave Warclash,
due to schoolwork.
Immediately, they found a new lead guitarist in
Justin Hoogendoorn and were complete again.
Later, due to uncertainties, Justin left the band.
The search for a new lead guitarist started immediately. 


Rob Mokkenstorm was the first to respond.
The first time Rob played with Warclash during one of their jam sessions, the band were all amazed by Rob’s masterly guitar skills, so they decided to let him join the band. 

The current line up:   
Jaco Ket (rhythm guitar & vocals)
Rob Mokkenstorm (lead guitar)
Mattijs Frank (bass)
Luc van den Bergen (drums)

The band released their first demo, “Diversity”, 
September 15th, 2007. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Warclash">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
