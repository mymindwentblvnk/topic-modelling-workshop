as stated on the antsy pants myspace:

"chris clavin, from plan-it-x records asked kimya dawson to record a song for the plan-it-x compilation cd. kimya was on tour in europe and didn't really feel like writing and recording a song on her own. she saw this as the perfect opportunity to fulfill her dream of starting a band with leo from bear creek, her 12 year old hero. she asked leo to record a song with her and he was excited to do it. she thought it would be really fun to get a bunch of her other friends in annecy, france involved too. so she got together with leo, angelo spencer, ben lupus, jane kidder, billy jet pilot, howard hughes, and her friends jarrod and emily (from port townsend, wa) who were on tour as the solvents. they recorded the song "amazing kids doing amazing shit". it was so fun they decided to make a whole album. so some fun collaborations, great singing by marie, awesome hang outs, and trips to the ice cream store later the album was done. this album is what you get when you take people who are huge fans of each other and put them in room together with an 8 track. there is a lot of love and friendship in this project. and it kind of happened by accident." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Antsy+Pants">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
