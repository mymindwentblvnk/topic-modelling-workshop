Formerly known as Bunsen Honeydew until legal action from Henson Corporation necessitated a name change, the Four Volts are a New York rock group with a harsh, urgent style like Sonic Youth as a BritPop group. Discovered by former Blur guitarist Graham Coxon (who released their work initially on his own label, Transcopic), the Four Volts had a friendly parting-of-ways in 2006 after releasing one full-length album, "Triple Your Work Force." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Four+Volts">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
