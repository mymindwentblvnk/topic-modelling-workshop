Serpent Omega is a doom/sludge metal band from Stockholm, Sweden, formed by the sole intent of mediating gargantuan earth-splitting heavy tunes. The band was vomited out of the innards of the Great Serpent in 2011, ever since exploring the beyond side of the void and worshipping the power of the Riff.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Serpent+Omega">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
