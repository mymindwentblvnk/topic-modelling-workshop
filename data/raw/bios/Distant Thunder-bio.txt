There is more than one band called Distant Thunder.

1) Helstar is well known by 80's metal fans as one of the prototypical bands of that decade, one of the bands that defined American metal for the era and one that has been quite influential on any number of bands since their reign. Though there have been frequent reunion gigs in recent times (and more on the way), there doesn't appear to be plans for Helstar to return as an official recording band. So, vocalist/founder James Rivera decided to do the next best thing, that being forming a new band to carry on the Helstar tradition. Thus was born Distant Thunder (named, of course, for the 1988 Helstar album), perhaps as much a Rivera solo project as a real band, but nonetheless an outlet for Rivera to continue the Helstar legacy. The music is solid 80's-inspired American metal, with Rivera as always in top form -- his is a classic metal voice, able to hit Halford-style high notes but always under control and he keeps those high notes to a minimum, unlike others who tend to overdo the wailing 80's vocal style. Welcome The End is a top choice for 80's metal purists.

2) Distant Thunder was a one-man new wave band from California, consisting of Mark W, which self-released only one LP , Shelter, in 1985.
