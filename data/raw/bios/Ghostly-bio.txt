1)  Ghostly, is an English Grime MC and producer from West London. He has been named as one of the individuals that have played a key role in the resurgence of interest in pirate radio sets from 2013 onwards appearing on stations such as Deja Vu FM, Mode FM, Rinse FM and more on a similar path to many who came before him such as Dizzee Rascal, Wiley, D Double E and others.

2) Ghostly is an extreme drone/industrial metal project led by Deaemae.  The project is drum machine driven band that relies on repetative guitar riffs or droning noise with usually deep death metal-style grunts to high pitch black metal screeches.  The project has a primitive sound that Deaemae purposely tries achieving to create a "dark atmosphere."  

Initially, the project started off as a project that would play pure death metal with doom metal touches.  Eventually, the project took a change incorporating more industrial tones to the music than actual death metal.  The project is dubbed by Deaemae personally as an "extreme industrial project."

Influences range from Godflesh, Scorn, Pitchshifter, Sunn O))), Red Harvest, Halo, Hordes of Satan, Boris and other bands.  The project released one limited "real" demo entitled "Tombed". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ghostly">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
