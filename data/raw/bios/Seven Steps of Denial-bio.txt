The Metal formation from Hoofddorp Seven Steps of Denial is a special one. On their debut EP “7SD” the five musicians moving between different styles of Metal, influenced by bands like Dream Theater, Death, Slayer and Iced Earth, combine technically challenging riffs, progressive bass lines and strong melodies that cling on you like a magnet. You could compare this band to a box of chocolates, you never know what you are gonna get.

The origin of their sound was developed not so long ago. Founded by Laurens Kreeft (Drums) and Dennis Mes (Lead / Rhythm Guitar), both ex-Anubis, a former Rob Acda Award finalist. After the break-up of Anubis in 2006, these guys were looking for a new musical challenge. A technical challenge with catchy riffs, mesmerizing melodies, non-standard rhythms and pounding technical guitar licks.

After a long period of changing line-ups, Seven Steps of Denial contacted Edwin de Boer and after several rehearsals and conversations the new line-up is formed. Now Seven Steps of Denial is in their strongest and best line-up ever. Are you ready to be baffled?

Seven Steps of Denial wil be entering the studio in October 2011. Now stronger than ever the depth of the songs, the essence and vision of the band will be once again translated into their second EP.

The search for a distinctive sound has always played a large role within the band. By listening to their songs, you will clearly hear the unity and passion for all Metal. They make a clear statement: Loosen up your necks and prepare your ass for some serious kicking!
