Chain Collector are from Norway and was formed in 2003 as an idea to play hard (heavy metal) but still melodic. The members come from other bands such as Carpathian Forest, Green Carnation, In The Woods..., Neongod, Trail of Tears, Apostasy and Dismal Euphony... so the musical specter and experience is quite wide (that is one thing they do take advantage of and put it into their music) A demo tape was recorded in 2004 called "Forthcoming addiction" in DUB studio (other bands like Green Carnation, Blood Red Throne and Carpathian Forest have recorded there) which contain 6 songs. In 2004 they signed a two album record deal with Sound Riot. Their first album album called "The Masquerade" was released in June 2005.
The second album  "Unrestrained"  was released by Sublife Productions in 2008.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Chain+Collector">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
