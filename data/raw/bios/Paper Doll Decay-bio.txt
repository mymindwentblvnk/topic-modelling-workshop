Paper Doll Decay is a death metal band formed in Utrecht, NL in 2008.

Paper Doll Decay converges sonic terror with visual delight by unleashing uncompromising brutal death metal fronted by one of the most charming female growlers around.

Paper Doll Decay started out as a project and was originally formed in late 2008 by Janneke de Rooy and Caspar Koster. Together they wrote material for a three song demo which was recorded and produced by Caspar in the course of 2010. In order to become a full-fledged band and raid the stage, bass player Jarno Hol was recruited in late 2010 together with drummer Robin Boogaard, who left in 2012 and was replaced by Rob Koene a few months later.

The band is working on new material while introducing themselves live on venues across the land. Paper Doll Decayâ€™s sole mission is immersing you in their authentic and fierce assault of aggression, rage and despair far beyond any mainstream or commercial approach. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Paper+Doll+Decay">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
