Elizabeth Anka Vajagic is a singer and guitarist writing raw, uncompromising gothic folk and blues music with modern dissonances and timeless catharses, currently signed to noted independent label Constellation Records. She was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada and has been unleashing her devastating voice in chillingly controlled doses for years now.

She has worked with members of Godspeed You! Black Emperor and Hangedup, and Harris Newman, and has been praised among independent press publications for her dark, ethereal recordings. She was part of the Constellation European Roadshow in 2004, and for the past couple of years, has contributed vocal parts to the recordings and live performances of Land of Kush.

Her debut EP "Elizabeth Anka" was self-released in 2000. It was followed by the full-length "Stand With the Stillness of This Day" in 2004 and the EP "Nostalgia/Pain" in 2005. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Elizabeth+Anka+Vajagic">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
