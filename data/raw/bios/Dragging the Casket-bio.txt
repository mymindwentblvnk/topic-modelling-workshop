L-G Hakamo (formerly L-G Jonasson) of Swedish death/thrash outfit ARISE
has launched a solo project named DRAGGING THE CASKET and has now released
the debut album entitled “The Undead”.

Commented L-G: “I basically got tired of getting fucked over by record labels,
spending a fortune on studio time and compromising about the direction of songs.
I wanted to try how good it could sound if I did everything myself. Realizing
my weaknesses in the vocal department I managed to team up with a great guy named
Jonatan Storm who delivered all the vocal recordings really fast. I owe him big
time for this!” <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dragging+the+Casket">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
