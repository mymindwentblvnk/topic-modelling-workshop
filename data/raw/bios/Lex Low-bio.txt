Lex Low, who previously operated under the moniker ALECS, is a young songwriter/producer from West London.  
 
Born in the Sussex countryside his early background is steeped in the guitar driven rock/pop music of the 60’s & 70’s, drawing on influences from artists such as Badfinger, Terry Reid and melody driven 90’s bands like Jellyfish. 

He then immersed himself in the world of alternative R&B, listening to the likes of The Weeknd, Frank Ocean and Autre Ne Veut, which have had a big impact on his production and writing style.  
Lex has been working with other emerging producers/writers such as Eddy Atlantis (half of R&B duo Xander Ghost); this hunger for fresh samples and sounds shape the space that his music occupies.
