From the first warm and evocative tinkle of the ivories on his 2009 debut "There's a Saying", I knew that Oxfordshire based Cosmology was onto big things. Following a couple of single-track signings to Plush Recordings, he was commissioned to return with his first four track EP "If Love Would Bring" which displayed a wealth emotional colours and musical possibilities.

His production and composition style reminds me very much of mid-nineties DnB. Not through mawkish nostalgia, but by developing great musical ideas and courageously defying 'me-too' genre stereotypes. Cosmology reminds me of an excellent cook, from seemingly basic sample and synth ingredients he has the knack for boiling a musical idea down to its pure essence, and delivers a beautifully presented and nutritional dish with a refreshingly unique taste that lingers gracefully on the palette.

No surprise then, that he has tracks being snapped up by various taste-making labels including the mighty and prolific SOUL DEEP RECORDINGS. Currently working on tracks for Ash-A-Tack's Directors Cut imprint, a remix EP for Binary Feedback alongside V-Records' storming 'Savage Rehab' and Italian neurofunk supremo 'Maztek', plus various collabs in the pipeline, Cosmology is certainly one to bookmark and keep your ear on - else you may be missing something pretty special <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cosmology">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
