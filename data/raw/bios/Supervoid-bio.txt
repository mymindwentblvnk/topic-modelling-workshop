1) Forming around January of 2012, 5 friends from different bands in the Pittsburgh area came together to form the aural juggernaut that is Supervoid. Influenced by many artists (but not limited to) such as Kyuss, Clutch, Mastodon, Thin Lizzy and many more, they began to blend both vast soundscapes of Sludge/Prog Metal with elements of Rock Nâ€™ Roll. 

The band trimmed down to four members in 2014 and continues on.

Supervoid has played live shows with well-known artists including: The Atlas Moth, Pilgrim, Samothrace, Been Obscene, Windhand, Neon Warship, Borracho, and many others.
