After "The Vault" release in 2011 the band was close enough to disappear, but the decision to continue was made, and the band was in some kind of anabiosis during the 2012 searching for new members. In the end of 2012 the new crew gave birth to BLOODLAST.
At present we're recording an album which will differ both by sound and content from the previous release: more technical, brutal, progressive. New single and lyric video were released in September 2014, new EP "The Man Doesn't Change" was released in January 2016.

Roman Gralevsky - vocals
