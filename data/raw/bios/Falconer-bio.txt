There are two artists bearing the name Falconer:

1) Falconer was Stefan Weinerhall's (former guitarist of Mithotyn) Swedish power metal project, with strong folk influences, aimed at being similar to Mithotyn, but (in contrast to typical harsh vocal-ed folk metal/viking metal) with clean vocals.

Created in May 1999, the project initially started unnamed. Their self-titled debut album Falconer was released in March 2001. Since then, they've released eight other albums: Chapters from a Vale Forlorn (2002), The Sceptre of Deception (2003), Grime vs Grandeur (2005), Northwind (2006), Among Beggars and Thieves (2008), Armod (2011),Black Moon Rising (2014) and From a Dying ember (2020).

Vocalist Mathias Blad, who performed on the first two albums and on the third album as a guest vocalist on a few songs, returned for the recording process of the 5th album, Northwind. On albums The Sceptre of Deception and Grime vs Grandeur vocals were performed by Karl Kristoffer Göbel. With the addition of the new singer, Falconer's music also changed and became faster and more aggressive. Many fans thought that with these two albums and a new singer's style FALCONER moved too far away from their folk influences, which was their trademark from the very beginning, so eventually the decision was made to have Mathias Blad back on vocals. Mathias' unique, melancholic, mid-range vocals, atypical for metal in general, was also one of the Falconer's trademarks that most fans considered to be irreplaceable. With Mathias back on vocals, their album Northwind (2006) also marked the return of more folk influenced music, in the vein of the first two albums.

They disbanded in 2020 after their final album was released.
