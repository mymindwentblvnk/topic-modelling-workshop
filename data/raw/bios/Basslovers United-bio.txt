Basslovers United was founded in 2004 in Munich, Germany. 

Their love for Dance, Techno and Trance Music gave them the idea to start up with some productions on their own. 

After several productions, the record label CUEPOINT, Hamburg, Germany, signed them up, because it believed in the creativity of the Basslovers United.
