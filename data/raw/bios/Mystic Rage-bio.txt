here are two kinds of control. Control over others and control of yourself. Mystic Rage battles against the former to gain the latter. While society and government slip further downhill all the time, the members of Mystic Rage just want to be in charge of their own little piece of planet. Without governments and corporations doing everything they can to steal their money and their freedom. Without critics telling them what kind of art they should be making. Mystic Rageâ€™s music is strongly influenced by the harmonized vocals of Alice In Chains, the songwriting prowess of The Beatles, and the groove and heaviness of Pantera. Their latest release "Revolution" explores the battle for control on three levels of their lives: the government at large, the naysayers around them, and the often-uncontrollable interpersonal tragedies. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mystic+Rage">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
