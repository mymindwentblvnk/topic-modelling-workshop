There are more than one artist with this name:

1) Athos is a one man anti-Christian Black Metal band from Kalamata.

Athos was the ancient Titan that during the Titanomahia (War Of Titans), took a huge rock and threw it against Poseidon, but the huge mountain rock missed and landed at Halkidiki. Till today that place is named Mount Athos but till christians moved there few know the real story. And even the name of that mountain. Now is most known as agion oros (Tromara toys) and now nothing reminds of the ancient hellenic beauty that once excisted. So Athos songs speaks about The Awakening Of the ancient Hellenic world against the judeochristian plague that came and raped the ancient glory
