ABIOSI has its name originated from the word abiose, "no life", inspired by the lack of love people have for life, killing for trivial reasons.
The sound is defined as Thrashcore / Metalcore, heavy and aggressive, with lyrics in Portuguese, in protest against social, political and racial inequality, preaching peace by bringing a peripheral culture and portraying the difficulties encountered on the streets. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Abiosi">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
