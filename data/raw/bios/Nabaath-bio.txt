Nabaath — black metal / post-black metal band, formed in Obninsk, Russia in 2002.
The name comes from the word "nabat" [nʌ'bʌt] (alarm for war threats or forthcoming disaster).

Search for the esoteric meaning of existence beyond the boundaries of the world and consciousness. Rejection of dogma. Demonism. Destruction of the herd within - the nameless gray skeleton which bloodthirsty destroys free-being. Infinite chaos and doom to the darkness. Degeneration and destruction of hypocritical human essence and creation of the own, the immortal.
