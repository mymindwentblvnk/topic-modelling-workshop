An Extreme Gothic Metal band from Brazil. The band was formed in 2002. They first released a single called "Sobre uma noite sem pecados" in 2005. One year later the first demo followed (2006 - Irei em Paz). The band is still active. Their music embodies many interesting elements of several genres like Symphonic Black Metal, Melodic Death Metal & Gothic Metal. The music is very melodic  and symphonic and they use many keyboard melodies and melodic guitar solos, but it is also extreme at times, so they fit into the Extreme Gothic Metal genre.
