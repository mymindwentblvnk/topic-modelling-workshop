House of Wolves is the musical moniker of singer/songwriter/multi-instrumentalist Rey Villalobos,the name's origin coming from the translation of Villa-lobos from Spanish to English.  

A Los Angeles native, Villalobos's family originates from two different sides of the globe - Cananea Sonora MÃ©xico and Francavilla al Mare on the Italian Adriatic Coast. Rey grew up a classically trained pianist, citing Chopin as his first and main musical influence. 

House of Wolves debut album Fold In The Wind presents a warm, ethereal, and poetic collection. While beautifully eerie in acoustic form, the songs are filled with emotional, intricate, and organic sounds, and blended with Villalobos's haunting melodies and tender voice they call to mind Elliot Smith, Sufjan Stevens, and Beach House.

This past 2010, Villalobos spent his time touring the U.S. and Europe and playing shows with: Sharon Van Etten, Villagers, White Rabbits, The Middle East, Avi Buffalo,  Blind Pilot, Laura Gibson, Damien Jurado, Little Joy, Seabear, Kaki King, and Fanfarlo.
