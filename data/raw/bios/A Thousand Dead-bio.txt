Hailing from Oakland, Ca, A Thousand Dead blend pulse-pounding progressive death metal technicality with the instrumental diversity of jazz and the dynamic contrast of post-rock. The driving force behind the groupâ€™s signature sound is a desire to push the limits of musicianship while establishing new creative territory in the already vibrant progressive metal scene. What organically evolved was a forward-thinking philosophy capturing the intensity of modern metal while embracing the harmonic structure of a diverse collection of musical influences.
