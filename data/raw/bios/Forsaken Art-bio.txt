Forsaken Art is Shemahmforash's one man band. Until now it has only one official demo, namely "The Awakening of a New Era", released by the Portuguese label Hell-War Productions in September of 2003.
Musically the sound of this project is in the vein of most of the raw Blackmetal bands, but lyrically it is different, the lyrics are mainly focused on ancient battles and in visions of the future.

In 2009 the demo "The Awakening of a New Era" was re-released in CD format, this time by the Portuguese label Mountain Goat Productions.
