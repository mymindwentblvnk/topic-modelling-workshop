There are multiple artists called 'Apologist':

1) Prog/electro house duo Sam Perez and Matteo Bruscagin AKA Apologist. The pair hail from the holy land of cosmic disco – Italy. Though obviously influenced by the era’s that spaced-out abandon, their varied productions span many musical universes, past and present.

Sam Perez and Matteo Bruscagin aka Brusca started to gain recognition with their dark, progressive thriller of a cut called “Ghosts and Ghouls” on H’Plus in 2004, but they don’t limit themselves to sinister grooves of that nature. While their style is always epic with sweeping synthesizers and digital drama and effects, Apologist is showing their sensual, dubbier side with this debut release on Wave Music. The duo has released productions and remixes together, separately and under different names on quality labels like Yoshitoshi, Baroque, Swift and Restart.

2) A japanese Death/Black Metal band (pictured)

3) A fastcore/post-hardcore band from Calgary, Canada. Their demo can be downloaded for free at http://www.apologistband.bandcamp.com . 

4) The alias of experimental/noise musician Rose Actor-Engel.
