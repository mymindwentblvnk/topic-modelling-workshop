From a very young age, Caleb Cornett found himself heavily influenced by music. Born and raised in a small town in eastern "bluegrass" Kentucky, Cornett spent much of his childhood banging on his small keyboard and strumming his first notes on guitar. It was then that he realized he had found his niche - his own form of self-expression.

A decade later, a 23 year old Caleb is now known to the world as Amtrac, a musical pioneer on the forefront of America's exploding dance music scene. Kentucky's own dance music star has been a trailblazer for electronic music in his region, and shared the stage with an impressive group of artists including Diplo, Mr. Oizo, Steve Aoki, Designer Drugs, LA Riots, Kid Sister and more. Now breaking onto the festival circuit, Amtrac's loyal fans are living the American dream through him as he's made it from his parent's house in Kentucky to traveling the nation and receiving worldwide recognition. Now based in Miami, you can find Amtrac making music full time and lighting up dance floors and festival stages coast to coast.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Amtrac">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
