The NZ-trio (Jake, Zac and Jesse) were all part of different projects in the past (10 internet points for the first person to track this down) comes with b&w pictures and with Sam de Jong in the production seat (who earned his stripes with Mzwetwo and Maala). And a great debut track, of course. Hurricane Love relies on a pretty epic but minimal beat that comes with a soaring vocal and an absolutely massive chorus - it’s the kind of song you sway along to after one spin and sing along to after five. “We just can’t get enough / of this hurricane love” (and L.A WOMEN).
