Noise Box is an Industrial/Experimental duo, dated back from the late 80's/early 90's. Noise Box was formed in Seattle, Washington in 1988 over a cup of coffee in a small caf√© in the Paramount theatre. The original two man line up consisted of Andre Robinson and Josh Helm. The two had previously been recording with high school buddy Lamar Lofton on bass under the name T.N.A.T.R. 

Cory Kane (Satchel) and his brother Kari Kane  (Pretty Boy Floyd) were added to the lineup at the request of Cleopatra to enhance live shows with drums and bass but never appeared on any recordings though both appeared in the video shot for Monkey Ass. (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kitiA5QQ4co)

In a city renowned for its output of grunge bands, Seattle's Noise Box are one of the few Industrial bands on the block. Dre (aka Databomb) and Josh (akaUrban Revolutionary Underground / The Silent Majority) began recording together, with a raging sound quite similar to regional heroes Skinny Puppy -- who had set up shop across the border in Vancouver almost ten years before. After a demo tape sent to the Industrial label Cleopatra gained them a contract, Noise Box recorded Monkey Ass for a 1995 release quickly followed up with the EP NUFFNUTZ. Two years later, the group returned with The Bigginning, the last studio recording.

Noise Box reformed in 2012 to play select dates along the west coast of the United States.
