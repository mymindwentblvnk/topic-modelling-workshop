Roller Derby is a trio from Hamburg, Germany. Founded in early 2020 by Philine Meyer (vocals, keys), Manuel Romero Soria (guitar) and Max Nielsen (bass), Roller Derby make rock-infused indie pop. The Hamburg trio cite dream pop and indie influences, citing a love of “chorus guitars, synth pads, and tweepop vocal melodies” in their music “about longing for love and enduring loss, without losing its lightness.”  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Roller+Derby">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
