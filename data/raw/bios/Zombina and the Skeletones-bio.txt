Zombina and the Skeletones are a horror punk band from Liverpool, England, formed in 1998 around the nucleus of vocalist Zombina and songwriter Doc Horror. The majority of their tongue in cheek lyrical content deals with themes of horror and science fiction, yet their musical style is upbeat and pop oriented, with elements of garage punk, doo wop and hard rock. Due to their apparent obsession with B Movies and black humour their fanbase extends to the gothic rock, deathrock and psychobilly scenes.

Zombina and the Skeletones are especially popular on Halloween playlists.
