Born in 2001 with a sound firmly based on the roots of classic Thrash Metal, Killem has been a band in constant evolution, always adding new influences coming from other styles like progressive or death metal in order to develop their own personal sound.

During its existence, the band has been able to share the stage with international acts like Napalm Death, Moonsorrow and Tankard among others; and also with Spanish metal giants like Saratoga, Warcry and Lujuria.

Their discography includes the critically acclaimed demo Void, that opened the gates for the bandâ€™s first full length record, MUTED, released by Dark Rails Records. Following the release of MUTED, the band appeared in interviews, reviews and sampler CDs on the Spanish editions of Kerrang! and Metal Hammer among others.

At present, the band is focused on writing new material, including new levels of experimentation and brutality in their sound.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Killem">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
