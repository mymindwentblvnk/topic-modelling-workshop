Delusive Dawn was formed in 2001 by six people who wanted to perform Death Metal. From the very first they created a style which was heavy but also very melodic.
After a number of first gigs the EP “Resistance Is Futile” was released in 2002. The feedback was amazing and so the record was sold out very quick.
During the following years Delusive Dawn gained experience by playing many shows – till this day with bands like Disillusion, Manos, Golem, Darzamat, Debauchery, Disbelief, Agathodaimon, Belphegor or Graveworm.
In the course of time style changes occurred and could be heard on the single “Off The Dark” (Halls Of Hidden Hate) from 2004. A new demo for promotional purposes was recorded and released in 2005. At the same time some line-up changes were pending, so the band couldn’t play many shows. The musical development wasn’t retarded by these circumstances. The songs reached a higher level in complexity and heaviness. The keyboard and the female vocals were omitted from this time forth.
In the autumn of 2006 Giacomo completed the current line-up which can be heard on „Enter The Gates“ – the first full-lenght album (2008).  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Delusive+Dawn">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
