There were three bands with the name The Wimps.
1. A London, UK based power-pop/mod/punk band founded in 1977 and disbanded in 1980. Released one EP "Hamburger Radio" on Sniff Records and a single "At the discoteque". Their song "Modern Girls" was included in the compilation "Obscure Independent Classics Vol. 2" on Alan Jenkins' Cordelia label.
Band members: Rob Metcalfe (vocals), Rog Hyams (drums), Rick Marshall (guitar), Saul Rosenberg (bass), J. Rosenberg (guitar)

2. Wimps were a punk rock band in Olympia in the early 80s, founded by musical visionary Curt Homan. They weren't as hardcore as some of the bands, but they had their moments. The pre-dated, and influenced, Nirvana's punk-pop sound.  "Teen Spirit" in particular was influenced by "You Should Just Go To Your Church And I'll Go To MIne."  Every 15 years or so they play live, whenever the old Tropicana building becomes available.

3. Swedish all-female punk rock band in the early 2000's. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Wimps">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
