Taking inspiration from great contemporaries such as Chimaira and Lamb of God, as well as Classic Metal such as Metallica and Pantera. Blood of Ash derive their name from the 80's Horror flick "The Evil Dead." And make no holds bared on creating unrelenting hardcore metal to kill Zombies to!

So Far BOA have ripped across the UK, relentlessly gigging on the back of a few low quality demos, but thanks to the new signing with Four Aces, (the record label that has brought to your ears Abel is Dying, Born to Break Even and the ever growing The Maple Room) Blood of Ash will hit the studio soon and hit you with a record so brutal it'll be like a shotgun blast to the face!
