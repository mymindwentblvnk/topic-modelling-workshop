Yoel was born and raised in New York, Damien was born in Paris, raised in Australia. They met in Lyon when they were teenagers, and decided to make music together. After school, one left for London, the other for Bogotá. Years later, music brought them back together, in Nice, but things did not work that well and they decided to split. Yoel moved to Berlin, where he still lives. They kept in touch and eventually started a distance music-relationship, which became pretty serious three years ago. They weren’t named Part Company in the first place, when they were discovered on the Inrocks platforms « CQFD » two years ago. Whatever. They got signed by french indie label Gum (The Shoes, Woodkid, Herman Dune), and just released their first EP, Babar in both digital and vinyl 7’’, colored with many rock influences.
