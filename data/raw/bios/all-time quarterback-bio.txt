Mistagging for ¡All-Time Quarterback!
¡All-Time Quarterback! is a solo-project alias of Ben Gibbard, frontman of Death Cab For Cutie and The Postal Service. There have been three releases under the name, and a limited amount of touring.

In the spring of 1999, between tours, Ben Gibbard had some songs buzzing around his head that wouldn't really work as Death Cab For Cutie songs. Thus, armed with a guitar, some broken keyboards and four-track, he set about documenting them.

This process resulted in two releases: the CD EP All-Time Quarterback! (which included a cover of The Magnetic Fields' Why I Cry), and the "straight to Walkmen" cassette release The Envelope Sessions (which included Underwater, which was later rerecorded by Death Cab For Cutie for a 7" single on Sub Pop). Both were released on Bellingham, WA label Elsinor, and a small mini-tour occurred to support the releases. Ben went back to Death Cab For Cutie to record their second album.

In 2002, with both original releases out-of-print, Barsuk Records put out the ¡All-Time Quarterback! CD album. Consisting of the best of both releases, along with an outtake from the original EP sessions and a video for Plans Get Complex, (which was shot in a variety of locations across London, including Regent Street and a London Underground train), this release is currently still available. This has been the most recent action under the ¡All-Time Quarterback! name.
