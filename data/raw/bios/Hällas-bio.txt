Hällas is an adventurous heavy rock band founded in Jönköping, Sweden in 2011.

"The band has a 70's sound while adding an aura of 80's NWOBHM as well as psychedelic sounds, not unlike those of Hawkwind. The result makes you think not only of bands such as Graveyard and Horisont, but also of Mountain and November. " - Artrock.se, 2015. 

Since 2011, the original guitarist, Jesper, has left the band and was replaced by Marcus in 2014, following the addition of organist Nicklas in 2015. In the process of making their debut EP "Hällas", released by The Sign Records in 2015, the band played together with various bands such as Danava, Skogen Brinner and Slowgold. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/H%C3%A4llas">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
