Biografi
Norwegian heavy metal giant noplacetohide hails from the drug-infested extreme right wing coastal town of Tønsberg. Upon forming back in 1989 and inspired by death and thrash metal, the young boys set out to explore the exciting sounds of contemporary metal. First documentations were two demos in 1992 and 1993, and the band already displayed a mature approach to style and song writing. Along with tours across the country, the early recordings gained noplacetohide the rumour "the best metal band in Norway". All this before the band had even released a record.

Early 1995 the young men recorded the self financed debut album "Vergangenheit", occasionally dubbed a masterpice and long since sold out, the CD elegantly sums up the first 6 years of the band's existence and stylistic experimentation.

In 1998 noplacetohide was revitalized with new members Birger
(guitar) and Hasse (vocals), and the band aimed for a more percussive and repetitive approach. New material proved to be even heavier and more extreme than the debut, but at the same time more accessible, due to the band's newfound economy in motion. With about 40 minutes of new music noplacetohide recorded and mixed their follow-up album during 2000/2001. It would take another four years and the departure of vocalist Hasse before the world would be ready for Zukunft. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/NoPlaceToHide">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
