Blind Dog formed when Tobias Nilsson and Joakim Thell needed a drummer for a party gig. Thomas Elenvik was called in to do one gig but the band stuck together since they discovered that everything worked so well. 
Blind Dog recorded a demo in 1996, which was discovered by RoadRunner and rendered them a place on the compilation album "Burn one up" in 1997. 

Getting tired of waiting for a record deal the band released their debut album in 1999 - "The Last Adventures of Captain Dog". This album was picked up by MeteorCity and re-released by them the year after. 

In 2002 the band was contacted by Listenable Records and a cooperation started with the band and to date has resulted in one album: "Captain Dog Rides Again" (2003).
 In 2008 the band decided to break up & give their last album out for free.
