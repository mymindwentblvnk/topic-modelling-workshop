Conceived late 2006 amidst the desires of non-indigenous Bristol stalwarts King Einon (ex Gurkha), Chris 'Wong' (Bomb Blast Men) & Jim (Cruelty) to keep us out of trouble; kicking bins etc... Recruited the missing pieces in the form of Tim (Turbowanker and a million eclectic Forest Of Dean bands/projects) for the fat strings and Guy Goatercycle to keep the beat. Played one short set at Scumfest under the moniker 'The Reckoning'. Then everyone started going on holidays, migrations etc. and things fell apart until a new impetus was arrived at along with the revised band name courtesy of the genius of Mark Twain. 'Claw It All Back' & 'Traitor's Gate' feature on the split CD/LP we share with those Massachusetts darklords MORNE. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Warprayer">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
