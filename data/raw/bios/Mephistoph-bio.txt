Mephistoph is a Blackened Death Metal band from Buffalo NY. They take inspiration from other bands such as Opeth, Behemoth, Bloodbath, and others.

Mephistoph was founded by Tom Gerwitz in May of 2009, originally to replace Death Metal band Unholy Sacrifice with Andy Abdale. The members broke off, Tom taking the name and forming his own project, while the rest of the members formed what would become Amatsu. 

In 2010 Tom brought in drummer Dan Malanowicz to try and start the band up again. Soon after guitarist Dan Drexel joined, followed by bassist Sean Malanowicz. They played one basement show together in October of 2010, and then disbanded. On April 24th 2011 Andy Clark (guitar) and Melissa Mayer (keyboards) joined along with drummer Tom Jurkovic. The band went on hiatus in late June of 2011 due to extremely busy schedules. 

In 2012 Tom decided to make Mephistoph his studio project, with the help of friends to fill in the missing parts, Andy Clark doing leads, and Derek Schultz on bass. Drums would be covered by Tom using EZ Drummer.

Mephistoph released "Chosen To Burn" on May 12th 2013
