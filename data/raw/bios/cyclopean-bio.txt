Cyclopean brings together long-term collaborators Burnt Friedman and Jono Podmore with Can's founding members Jaki Liebezeit and Irmin Schmidt for the first time.

The title 'Cyclopean' perfectly sums up their sturdy, yet angular, and somehow arcane compositions, inferring a sense of organic classicism in the manner H.P. Lovecraft might ascribe to an alien megatropolis, or equally beautiful forms "that interlock, intersect and connect seemingly contradictory components." 
Jagged, wiry polyrhythms protrude like scaffolds of huge inflated synth structures adorned with melodic motifs that will appeal to followers of any of the involved personnel. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cyclopean">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
