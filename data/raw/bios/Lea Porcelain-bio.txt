Lea Porcelain are Berlin / London based producer / singer duo Julien Bracht and Markus Nikolaus.

Bracht's love of music began aged six, when he started to play drums. He started producing when he was sixteen, and had developed a live techno set by eighteen. To date he has played shows worldwide, shared the stage with the likes of Ricardo Villalobos and Sven Vath and had an international club hit with his first single. Nikolaus' musical career was born out of the independent scene, where he signed with New York label Wolf + Lamb and had extensive solo touring experience.

The pair met in 2012 at their favourite club in their hometown of Frankfurt. After years of friendship and touring their individual projects they formed Lea Porcelain and soon gained fans across international blogs, as well as Lauren Laverne and Tom Ravenscroft at BBC 6Music, who have touted them as a band to watch in the year ahead.
On the live circuit they've played to spellbound fans at some of the best European festivals and venues, including Eurosonic, Reeperbahn and Berlin's Berghain Kantine.

Sonically, their sound recalls the dystopic darkness of early Manchester but with a uniquely entrancing use of electronic synths and drums.
Lyrically, they are inspired by Post-Punk, New Wave, Indie-Folk and Krautrock. The resulting three track EP is a menacing collection of sweeping instrumentals and emotional swells.

Lea Porcelain's debut EP 'Out Is In' will be released via Kobalt on April 2016. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lea+Porcelain">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
