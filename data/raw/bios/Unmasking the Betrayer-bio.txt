The band originating from Athens,Greece was formed in December 2008, by Giotis,Ares,Chris,Bill and Spiros. On the summer of 2010, Chris Lagkousis(Neverdies) joined the band as its new Vocalist. 
"We compose music we believe cannot be easily described in one genre tag,since it's a mix of subgenres".

They've shared the stage with quite a few great bands,despite them being a new scheme,with the greatest example being their opening act for The Black Dahlia Murder,which was the 2nd time they ever went on stage.

"Our goal is to excel at what we do,and create In-your-face music with no cliches".
Unmasking  the Betrayer has shared the stage with:
THE BLACK DAHLIA MURDER
CALIBAN
PARKWAY DRIVE
EMMURE
HEAVEN SHALL BURN
