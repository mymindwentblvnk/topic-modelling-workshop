Hailing from the south eastern suburbs of Melbourne Australia, Naberus are a four piece melodic groove metal band heavily influenced by melodic death, thrash and groove metal. With the release of their demo Ruins of Society in 2009, Naberus first showcased their ability to blend aggression, melody and groove.

With a fresh sound and the release of the new EP, The Fallen, recorded and mixed by Ermin Hamidovic of Systematic Productions, Naberus will continue to push the boundaries of their abilities and creativity. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Naberus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
