Alaska! is an indie rock trio from the United States. The members of the band are Russell Pollard (formerly of Sebadoh and Folk Implosion), Imaad Wasif (formerly of Folk Implosion) and Lesley Ishino (formerly of the Red Aunts).

Imaad Wasif was touring with Lowercase when he met Russell Pollard in 1999. Pollard was playing with Sebadoh at the time, and the two became fast friends. Within a year, Pollard and Wasif left their respective bands and recovened in San Francisco to form Alaska. The duo derived an icy cool, layered indie rock sound. Shows with Mia Doi Todd, the Folk Implosion, the Flaming Lips, and Beachwood Sparks allowed Alaska to test their material. By 2002, Alaska had a deal with B-Girl Records. Their debut album, Emotions, was released in February 2003 and former Red Aunts drummer Lesley Ishino joined them for a North American tour. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/alaska%21">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
