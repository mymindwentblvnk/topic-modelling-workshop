Producer, occasional vocalist, and DJ Nina Kraviz hails from Irkutsk, Siberia -- not exactly a dance music hot spot. Kraviz fell under the spell of house music during the mid-'90s through radio. A few years later, she moved to Moscow for the sake of studying dentistry and was, briefly part of a trio called MySpaceRocket. The group released one 12", 2007's "Amok," a lean house track with a deep bassline and Kraviz's breathy vocals; the B-side featured a version from U.K. DJ legend Greg Wilson. Kraviz subsequently went solo and made a splash in 2009, when she issued productions on Efdemin's Na√Øf, Jus-Ed's Underground Quality, and Matt Edwards' REKIDS. The following year, Kraviz issued another handful of singles, including a sound clash with Sascha Funke that appeared on BPitch Control. "Ghetto Kraviz" was her lone 2011 single and set up the release of her first album, a self-titled set for REKIDS.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nina+Kraviz">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
