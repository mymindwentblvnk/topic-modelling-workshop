Biography:
Aruna Azura (Aruna Azure in the very beginning) was formed in June, 2009 by the members of different bands in search of fresh ideas and new horizons: So, in September 2009 the first demo "Let Them Live" was recorded. The released stuff was warmly accepted by public and some webzines all over the world; that fact convinced the members of the band in their correct choice of the way to formalize their aspirations.
In a short time the conclave has transformed from an experimental studio project up to all-sufficient unity of the ones willing to make an excellent musical material against all of the stereotypes. 
"E" was changed "A". Why? Only band members know the answer.
Aruna Azura suspended their activities for a short time in 2011 due to their other band, The Unhallowed, but returned soon to reconstruct and record a stuff they really wanted, something new that finally met their own expectations.
