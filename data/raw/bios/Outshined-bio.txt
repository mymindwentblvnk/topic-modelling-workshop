Outshined is a very driven San Francisco four piece hard rock band. Outshined has been writing and performing for three years all over California and has built an avid following. Vocalist Jon Carr hails from Santa Barbara, bringing an edge to the band that echoes the likes of Scott Weiland and Layne Staley. Drummer Ryan Amazing comes from the East Bay, bringing with him the energy and commitment of the Hardcore scene. Bassist Luke Lundin and Guitarist Kyle Luck grew up in Santa Cruz together, playing in many bands before finally landing in the same group-- and the timing could not be better. Outshined has a very powerful presence, and a crushing live performance. The goal of the band is to always offer an honest and true sound to the wide genre we call Rock and Roll. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Outshined">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
