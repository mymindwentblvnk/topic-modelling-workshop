Thy Nature was formed in Italy in 1992. The band consisted of Patrick Graziosi - Guitar, Michele Brustia - Bass (Gory Blister), Oinos - Drums (Sadist (Ita), Node, Cayne, Alice in Darkland).

They played technical progressive death metal, influenced by Atheist, Cynic, Coroner,  combining the violence of death metal with lot of jazzy interludes: great songwriting, heavy guitars, lot of tempo changes, jazzy guitar solos, sudden accelerations, brutal parts, thrashy passages, growling vocals with some thrashy choirs here and there and a female singer in one song, double bass drum passages, and more.

They only released a self-titled EP in 1995. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Thy+nature">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
