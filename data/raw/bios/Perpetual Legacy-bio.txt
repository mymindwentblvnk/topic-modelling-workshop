The band Perpetual Legacy, coming from Brasília, Brazil, emerged in early 2014, when Matheus (bass player) and Michelle (vocalist) played together in a extreme metal band and shared the idea of ​​holding a project back to Symphonic Metal. From there, the band worked hard on compositions and studies, to give life to the first full album entitled "The New Symphony for Him", ​​with 11 well-built tracks, each bringing their sound peculiarities.

The band sought influence in the genre bands like Epica, Nigthwish and After Forever. However, it managed to build their own identity, always seeking to be original in style.  The debut "The New Symphony for Him" ​​released in September 2015, had very positive repercussions worldwide and was on the list of best metal albums released in Latin America in this year.

Perpetual Legacy brings the mix of weight and melody for each song, marrying heavy/power metal with some orchestration and folk elements. The vocal is sober and versatile, explores the bass and treble, also strolling the regions of classical/epic singing.
