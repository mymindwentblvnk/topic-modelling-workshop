Description



Last Transgression are melodic death metal legends in the central Alabama underground rock and metal community. With early influences such as Death, Carcass and Cannibal Corpse, Last Transgression had a blueprint for what they would eventually turn into a precision-built think tank, crammed full of riffs, rhythms, and lyrical ideas that would spill out at every turn, causing all the youngn's to run up and grab chunks to take back to their own garages and bedrooms. The war on shitty music never stops, and neither does the Panzer LT. It keeps crushing through the debris of faux metal and claiming it's place at the front of the line. The most significant trait about Last Transgression is that they're not just an old school death metal band who only play one style, one tempo, or stick to one formula. Since the band's inception in 1994, Last Transgression have managed to progress by constantly listening to the world, experimenting, and doing what they did in the beginning...finding pieces to create new blueprints so that they may forever reinvent themselves. Just listen to their new album, Cynic Verses, for total clarity. You'll see how a band should progress, and you'll see how most others aren't.
