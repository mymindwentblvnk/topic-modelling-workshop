Kyrie Ellison is a storytelling power metal band from Albany, NY and formed in 1988. The band consists of three mainstays:  Mark G David, Chuck Woodard and Paul Joseph "Warrior". 

After many years of constant gigging and vocal/drummer changes in  1991, KE called it a day. With plenty of unfinished business, the three teamed back up in 2014 with the sole purpose of writing, recording, and releasing their debut CD. Session musicians were brought in to round out the recording phase. Kyrie Ellison - The Scriptures of Sadness was released in January 2015.
