Dragonscale (or DragonScale) is a young power metal band from Warsaw, Poland. Their lyrics are fantasy-themed with many good guitar solos. Wiktor Zakrzewski played with them as a drummer recently, but they winded him up and took 'nother drum-man. 

They've made an album called "Wandering the Lands".
