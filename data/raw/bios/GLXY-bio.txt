With both Tom and Jonathan having a background in music, the duo initially began working together during their time at the University of Leicester.

2015 brought them releases with Liquid Tones and Soulvent Records amongst others, whilst their spine-tingling Maze got released as part of MTA’s Winter Compilation in January 2016. Their effortlessly fluid sounds influenced a collaboration with distinctive vocalist  Belle Humble, and as a result the stunning Lonely has just landed – the duo have gained support from the likes of London Elektricity, LSB, Murdock and Hugh Hardie. Alongside their work in the studio, GLXY have also been notching up DJ sets across the UK with their creative and style-switching approach to mixing, most notably at a number of Hospitality events amongst some of the most respected names in D&B. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/GLXY">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
