OBTUSE BIOGRAPHY 2008

THE SICK THE DEAD THE ROTTEN part II:

After some delays not due to our responsibility, this opus of savage grind is now available with 19 tracks offered by 3 of the sickest bands around: Mumakil (Switzerland), Obtuse (The Netherlands) and Third Degree (Poland). Mumakil is one of the most promising metallic grind bands around and features members from bands like Nostromo and Knut. Obtuse have a self-released CD out titled "Silent heritage." A pummelling and intense grinding sound is what they deliver. Third Degree, with their second CD on Selfmadegod Records, delivers a violent, savage but surgical precise form of metallic, intense, grind. The artwork by SPINA Studios (Aborted, Leng Tch’e, Terminally Your Aborted Ghost, Permeated Records and many others) makes this disc look more brilliant than ever! Be prepared for 37 minutes of savage grinding mayhem!
