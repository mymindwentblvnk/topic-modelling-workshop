Virtual Reality was a one-off band featuring members of Doom playing a vastly different brand of music.  Really only "punk" in the widest sense - based on who was in the band and the lyrical content, VR sounded like an amalgamation of Black Sabbath and the KLF. Definitely "rock" meets techno or hip hop.... It's strange and hard to describe and has to be heard.  A product of the times, for sure.  This one came out on Flat Earth and Belgium's Genet records in 1995 and is their only release.  Several of these tracks found their way onto compilations - "Mind Pollution 2" for instance, but these 10 tracks make up their entire discography as far as I know.  Varying from groovy beats and heavy riffs to techno based tracks and white-boy rap, these guys certainly pushed the envelope of the 90s punk and HC scene.  A distinct record and one that any Doom fan should hear for the novelty alone.
