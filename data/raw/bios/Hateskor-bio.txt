In 2010, young guitarist Alex Skorza founded melodic death metal band Hateskor in Madrid (Spain). His musical idea is born from a clear concept: melodic metal finnish school. However, Hateskor had to achieve a more modern sound, close to the pagan and viking currents, which meant the arrival of singer McLeod to the band.

 In 2011 "Paint my fear", the first album of the band is released, recorded in Local 18 studios by Alex Skorza himself, mixed in Tainted Studios (Finland) by Jarkko Mattheiszen and mastered by James F. Murphy (Death, Testament, Obituary...) in Safehouse studios (USA).With this album Hateskor signs wit austrian label Noisehead Records, and achieves a great response both in media and public. Hateskor has suffered several changes in its line-up, and Alex Skorza and McLeod have been joined by Thordek Hammerfest (drums, ex-Silent Havoc) and Mon (bass, Egraine). Pianist Ito is, as well, in charge of keyboards.

 The renewed and committed band is actually writing new songs as well as promoting their first album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hateskor">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
