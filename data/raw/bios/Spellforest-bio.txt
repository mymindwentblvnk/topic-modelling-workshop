Spellforest is a hybrid blackened death metal band from Caracas, Vzla,  formed at the end of 1999  by members of Sea of Nectar, Hiedra, Verminous, and Landscapes. Unveiling an ethereal and misanthropic lyrical concept, Spellforest's sound combines the extreme speed and brutality of modern death metal with the aesthetics of nordic black metal by utilizing several progressive, symphonic and neofolk elements while maintaining a very old-school and raw sound.
