Family members Laura Stitt and her two cousins, Danny and Shannon Stitt have over time created one of Australia's most exciting up and coming Funk/Soul acts, “Uncle Jed”. 

With Danny (Bass) and Shannon (Keys) growing up on the north coast with a lifestyle of surfing and skating, the boys found a passion for jazz and funk music passed on by their musical Dad and after hearing their cousin Laura sing for the first time on a family holiday it created a dream they had to pursue of one day moving to Sydney and starting a band together. Laura would find tapes of song ideas in the letter box at her northern beaches home in Sydney and would add melody and lyrics, waiting until the next time the families got together to create the final products.

After years of long distance writing together the boys joined Laura in Sydney where the band recorded an EP 'Originate'. The EP propelled the band around the Sydney scene and led to an appearance on national television as part of the Logie award winning series 'All Saints' where the band performed two songs off the EP 'Why' and the track that opened the show, 'Dreamland'.

It's been a long wait but after more shows and heap of touring the band have just released their self titled debut album through Vitamin Records which was launched in June 2010 to a sell out crowd at one of Sydney's most prestigious live music venues, The Basement. The album involves some of the most recognised musicians in the industry and so do their live shows with the band playing regularly as a six piece all over Australia. Within months of its release, tracks off the album have been receiving airplay on Triple J and various community radio stations across Australia.
