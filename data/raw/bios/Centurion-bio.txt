 - A defunct progressive metalcore band from Brighton, UK, who released an EP 'One Hundred'. Centurion made quite a mark on their home turf and beyond, swinging their hefty, death plated punch at the heads of grateful punters nationwide at shows alongside their aforementioned townsmen, as well as the likes of Horse The Band, Ephel Duath and Every Time I Die. Centurion also toured as main support to acclaimed British crew Bring Me The Horizon, and were flown over to Sweden to play at the 2006 Treasurefest alongside the likes of Purified In Blood and Jeniferever.

Centurion offered up a thick stew of hyper-aggressive riffing and mammoth grooves, splicing the mix with flashes of accomplished technicality and vehement vocal bile, yet the quintet manage to retain an irresistible mood of energy and, dare it be said, fun in their live performance.

With press plaudits already flowing and a solid fanbase built, Centurion raised their game, their r debut E.P ‘One Hundred’ an unrelenting metallic drama that swings between ferocious and epic with a masterful ease. ‘One Hundred’ caught the attention of respected UK label In At The Deep End (Gallows, Architects, Send More Paramedics), and the label will be unleashing the E.P in early 2007. Centurion also hit the road again in January as support to Japanese metalcore crew Versus The Night, and opened for hometown compadres Architects and Canadian newcomers The Gorgeous on selected dates of their UK trek.
