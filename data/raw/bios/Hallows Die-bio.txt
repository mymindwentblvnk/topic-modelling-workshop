In today’s day and age, the world struggles to place a label on everything it can, to place every tangible creation into a category and catalogue it accordingly.

Since late 2006, Hallows Die has been forging a repertoire of songs, attempting to keep any one composition from sounding exactly like the next. The result: odd melodies intertwined with bizarre time changes, and unpredictable song structures. They strive to play strange and original material that continues to evolve, refusing to be classified under any one specific label.

With one EP already released, the band entered the studio with Colin Attlesey (Will of the Ancients) in November 2008 to record their first full length album “World of Ruin”, mastered by the legendary Dan Swano (Edge of Sanity, Ex-Bloodbath) who took the album’s soundscape to the next level. The album, released August 21st 2009, has kept audiences and industry figures talking, receiving such reviews as "Intelligent and well-thought out metal... the softer moments are some of the best shit I have heard in a long time... The future is bright!" (Dan Swano). The band has since shared the stage with such acclaimed acts as Dark Tranquillity, 3 Inches of Blood, Goatwhore, Augury, Wolven Ancestry, Woods of Ypres, and Neuraxis While their live appearances are increasing in frequency and scope, the band is continuing to write material exemplifying their belief that no label should be placed on personal expression.

A twisted world requires a twisted soundtrack; such is the goal of Hallows Die. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hallows+Die">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
