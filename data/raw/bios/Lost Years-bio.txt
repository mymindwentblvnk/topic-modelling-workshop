Lost Years is Magnus Larson from Avesta, Sweden. His enthusiasm for the 1980s, red wine and collecting Roland synthesizers has landed him a permanent spot on the Rosso Corsa Records roster. His music ranges from charming surprises to soundtracks for bad-ass newscasts. Both of these different sounds remain cohesive within the Lost Years aesthetic through the use of real 1980 synthesizers. Magnus has been professionally making 1980s-inspired music since 2008. Before he started collecting Roland synthesizers, Magnus spent his time playing guitar in the 80s punk and 90s hardcore scenes.
