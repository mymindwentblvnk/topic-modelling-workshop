Mad Alien aka Raymond Storebø

Formerly known under the names : Faib ,Pathfinder, Mad alien.

Born in Bergen/Norway in 1979

He changed his name to LUNA GENETICS instead of MAD ALIEN in 2007 since there are several other bands who use the name. And personally he didn’t think the previous name represent or fits his music anymore.

Started up on an Amiga back in 96-98 (at least then it became serious ) using Octamed/ Pro tracker. But then converted to PC & Mad Tracker 00-01… He released some Hardcore/Gabber demo tapes in the late 90’ies.But his style has developed into Rave,Acid,Trance,Psychedelic. It all depends on the mood. Nowadays he mostly uses FL Studio & a few other. He is not trying to make groundbreaking “fresh” trance/techno… Just trigger peoples minds to the positive,hopefully… He has always gone his own way musically,just making what comes to mind as long as it is electronic music
