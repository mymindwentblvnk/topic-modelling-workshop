1) Formed in the most frigid of Halifax winters in December of 2009. Slumlord have since been converting Haligonians into rabid drooling fans. The band consists of Tasha Gobeil on drums, Severine Kavanaugh on bass, and T.J. Kavanaugh on guitar. With a sound that can best be described as a cross between punk rock, classic rock, and a dash of blues and Thrash to taste,Slumlord are impossible to ignore.
