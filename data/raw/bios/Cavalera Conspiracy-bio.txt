Brazilian metal titans Max and Igor Cavalera have written and recorded new material together for the first time in twelve years, since their work in Sepultura.

Formed in the summer of 2007, Cavalera Conspiracy, is their new project and features the Cavalera brothers from Brazil, bassist Joe Duplantier from France (Band member of Gojira) and guitarist Marc Rizzo from the United States. 

Cavalera Conspiracy's debut record, Inflikted, was released on March 25, 2008 by Roadrunner Records. Recording took place in July 2007 at Undercity Studios in Los Angeles, with Logan Mader (ex-Machine Head guitarist).
Rex Brown cameos on bass on one track, Ultra-Violent.
(Rex Brown was Pantera's bass player. He currently plays in Down. In 2005, he also played bass and keyboard in Crowbar's Lifesblood for the Downtrodden.)
Black Ark features a collaboration with Max, Joe and Richie Cavalera (from Incite) on vocals.


This long-anticipated reunion between the Cavalera brothers is something fans across the globe have been clamoring for since Sepultura's last gig in December 1996.


"When Igor, and I met at the 10th Annual D-Low Memorial Show and got the instruments in our hands, it was like we had never been separated. The metal was flowing in our veins," comments Max. "It was the same in the studio."


In early January, 2008, Inflikted's tracklist was revealed. A B-side cover of the Possessed death/thrash classic, The Exorcist, was also recorded. A single for Sanctuary was released on March 3, 2008.
