Belthezar is a Black Metal band From South Africa.

Status : Active.

Members:

In the cold grim month of july 2008 two black metal scums decided to collaborate their ideas and spew out some riffs . Death defying black metal terror arose from the dark bass lines ov Lord Belthezar and the six string blasphemy ov Orlock. Together, combining some black sound to the ears,hate for religion , anti-human , anti-Life, misanthropy and general disgust with conformity ..... Belthezar was formed!!! 

Belthezar is currently working on material for the first Demo and EP as well as splits with other artist from South Africa . Demo to be released
