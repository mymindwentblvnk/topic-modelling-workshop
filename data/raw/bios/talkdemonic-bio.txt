Talkdemonic blends styles to create a captivating sound which their own bio describes as "folktronic hop." Acoustic guitar and viola swell over electronic blips and textures while the drums provide repeating revelation as each hypnotizing loop is peppered with expressive beats, punctuated by cymbal crashes. Fresh and intriguing, this Portland, OR twosome delivers a dreamy, emotionally arresting package that gets better with each listen.

The group was formed by Kevin O'Connor (percussion, synthesizer, piano, multi-instrumentalist) and Lisa Molinaro (viola, synthesizer). Their releases include Mutiny Sunshine (Lucky Madison, April 2004; Lucky Madison reissue January 2005)
Tour EP (Arena Rock Recording Co., 2005)
Beat Romantic (Arena Rock Recording Co., March 2006, US) (Tangled Up! Recordings, September 2007, UK)
Eyes at Half Mast (Arena Rock Recording Co., September 2008)
Ruins (Glacial Pace Recordings, October 2011)

In February 2007, Talkdemonic signed with One Little Indian in the UK. Their offshoot label, Tangled Up! was to issue a deluxe expanded edition of Beat Romantic in Europe on September 17, 2007. The enhanced version was to include a cover of Brian Eno's "Sombre Reptiles" and a video for "Mountain Cats".

Lisa also spent six months as a touring multi-instrumentalist and vocalist with the Decemberists in late 2006 and early 2007. She is now a full-time member of Modest Mouse and is in a committed relationship with the band's frontman, Isaac Brock. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Talkdemonic">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
