yMusic is an expandable group of performers, formed in 2008, actively engaged - and equally comfortable - in the overlapping orchestral & pop music worlds.  As well as being conservatory-trained, members are multi-instrumentalists, improvisers, composers, arrangers, conductors & singers.  Six core musicians perform as a dynamic chamber ensemble, writing / commissioning works to feature their revolving instrumentation & musical perspectives.  They also serve as a ready-made collaborative unit, for artists interested in expanding their sonic palette, on recordings & in performance.

Its members have toured & recorded with well-known artists, across genre, such as: Jay-Z, Björk, New York Philharmonic, Antony and the Johnsons, 坂本龍一, The National, Orchestra of St. Luke’s, Rufus Wainwright, Grizzly Bear, Yo-Yo Ma, Meredith Monk, David Byrne & Shara Worden (of My Brightest Diamond).
