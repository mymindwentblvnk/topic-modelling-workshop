She has had subsequent hits with singles such as "You Changed" and "Between Me and U".

Her solo debut album was originally scheduled for release in 2003 on MCA Records, under the title I Travelled. However, it was heavily delayed, and the label folded and the album was shelved. In the summer of 2005, a newly recorded album, This is Me. was released by Universal Music Canada.

According to a piracy report by IFPI, the international music industry body, there were "2.8 million illegal file swapping requests for her music in the first two weeks of her albumâ€™s release in 2005". At the same time Jully reportedly "struggled to sell 15,000 copies of the same album".

In Summer 2007, a new single entitled "Seven Day Fool" was released to Canadian radio and her second album Revival is scheduled to follow on October 16, 2007. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jully+Black">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
