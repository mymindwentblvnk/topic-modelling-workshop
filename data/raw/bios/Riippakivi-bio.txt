Riippakivi is a folk metal band from HÃ¤meenlinna Finland. The band started out as a one man project somewhere in 2008, but during 2009 and early 2010 other members has joined in and today the line-up is pretty much complete. The music has different dimensions: there's some really folky stuff, some darker and faster parts and some acoustic sections. The lyrics are written in Finnish and they're mostly dealing with the human struggle in some way or the other. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Riippakivi">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
