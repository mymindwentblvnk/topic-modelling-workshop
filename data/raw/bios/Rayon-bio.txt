(more artistwith same name, see discogs.com)

1. Rayon is Markus Acher (the Notwist, Lali Puna, Tied & Tickled Trio) alone under his headphones. He released two shortfilm soundtracks under this moniker and composes music with all sorts of instruments like xylophon, a portable harmonium, guitar and glockenspiel and arranges them in his computer. And he uses samples of old and dusty records. At least, that's what he says. Truth is, it's just his excuse for buying way too many records.

2. Leonn, born 1981/8/15 a female japanese indie artist / vocalist changed her artist name into Rayon at the end of 2007 and released a single: Shooting Star. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rayon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
