There is more than one artist with this name.

1) Dark Opera was a Death/Doom Metal band from Poland. Formed in 1991, by a young and aspiring musician: Paul Józwiak who already done a Demo (1991) for his Death metal band Pandemonium wanted to try something new, to form a Death Doom Metal band which would be known as Dark Opera. But time for his new band wasn't adequate enough when Józwiak done a second demo for Pandemonium in 1992: Devilri.

Finally Józwiak had some time up his sleeve when he invited his childhood friends: Mariusz Makowski (drums) and Mikołaj Wójcik (guitar) to join his new band. They've then released their first demo: The Day of Pariah which was released in May 2nd 1992. Due to some line-up discrepancies which resulted Paul Józwiak to return to his band Pandemonium a few weeks after the release of The Day of Pariah.

In 1994; Paul Józwiak revamped his Death/Doom metal band Dark Opera with a new band line up and during that year they've released their first and only album: Calling the Legend which was distributed by a now-defunct Polish record label Baron Records. Regardless the album was only released in a cassette format - they were actually unhappy with Baron and subsequently Dark Opera was no longer active to this day.

A year after the demise of Dark Opera, Józwiak's band: Pandemonium changed name to Domain which had same Death metal melodies as their original name. Odd enough in 2002, Domain changed back their old name to Pandemonium which are active to this day.
