Pizzagirl is the solo project of Liverpool based musician Liam Brown. Not a girl, nor having any affiliations with Pizza. Pizzagirl's music ranges from quirky, ironic, 80s informercial-esque pop to darker and more introspective European influenced electronica. With the help of a thrown together flatpack mini studio, Pizzagirl writes, records and produces all of his music and visuals from the comfort of this little bedroom in Aintree.

Armed on stage with himself, his trusty strings, sweet synth and handy portable computer, Pizzagirl loves to shred some chords, meet some new friends and guzzle some slices in whatever small corner of the world he may find himself in.
