Merry-Go-Drown was formed in the summer of 2000.

Consisting of members Donn Lacoste and Mike Anglin, both from the band - System Red, with Jeremy Young and Phill Breazeale of the band - Abuse. Added to this strong quartet was singer/songwriter Brandon Magnon who tied in aggressive writing with melodic attenuations. 

The band is based in New Orleans, Louisiana and has found a home at local venues such as Zeppelin's, The Howlin' Wolf and the House of Blues' The Parish.

The sound? Merry Go Drown writes and performs on a rock base with metallic and industrial influences. Overall they creatively balance drive and hooks to catch the listener's ear. 

How's the show? Energy, Accuracy, and More Energy. The band has performed with such artists as From Zero, 12 Stones, Twiztid, Nothingface, Battle for Ozzfest bands CYN, Mantis, & A Dozen Furies. 

Next, Merry-Go-Drown worked hard with David Maraldo, Beaver Productions and QPrime to be named as the opening slot for Def Leppard at the U.N.O. Lakefront Arena.

Most recently Merry-Go-Drown has been picked up by Jagermeister as a JagerBand. The First show on the list was opening for Disturbed at Pensacola Civic Center where they won thousands of fans.

Merry-Go-Drown recorded their latest album 'As She Screams' at their own studio, Merry-Go-Lounge, and worked with NoiseLab engineers Rob Granniss and Jimmy Agustin for mix and master. As She Screams features the cover artwork of Lateefa Wright; a sculpture that sets the tone of the album.
