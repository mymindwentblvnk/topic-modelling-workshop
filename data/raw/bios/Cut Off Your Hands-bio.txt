Cut Off Your Hands is: Nick Johnston (vocals), Jonathan Lee (guitar), Philip Hadfield (bass), and Elroy Finn (drums). Their self produced debut EP "Shaky Hands" was released in August 2006 on Speak N Spell, and includes the singles "You and I" and "Expectations".

Formerly known as Shaky Hands, the band decided to change their name due to a threat of legal action from a similarly-named American band (The Shaky Hands). As their EP was intended to be titled "Cut Off Your Hands", they simply decided to switch their artist name with the EP title.

February 2009 saw the departure of original guitarist Michael Ramirez. February also saw Brent Harris depart, due to continuing hearing problems. He will rejoin the band in 12 months. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cut+Off+Your+Hands">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
