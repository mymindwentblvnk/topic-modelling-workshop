Underage was a classic Italian hardcore band from the early '80s. Their sound epitomized the country's extreme take on the then-burgeoning hardcore scene: chainsaw guitar shredding, manic or shrieking vocals, marathon basslines, and hyperactive drumming. Along with bands like Negazione, Chain Reaction, Ingesti and Wretched, Underage was one of the fiercest, most memorable bands in all of the country's punk rock history. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Underage">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
