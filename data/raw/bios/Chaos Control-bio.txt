There are two artists with the name Chaos Control:

1. Chaos Control is an musical alter-ego for Avksentev Konstantin, born in 1988 in Kazan, Soviet Union. He started to compose music in 1995 by simple midi-tracker program, and year 2000 brought the first album - «Atlantida», super-rare record, existing in one copy on a magnet tape. So, next five years were filled with scattered and numerous releases - until year 2005 with simply entitled «Chaos Control» LP, which quickly was spread between internet electronic music communities, and 2008 «You Are Everything» - free-for-download album, officially released under Liminal Records label.

2. Chaos Control is a collaborative downtempo project formed by Mister Chill’R and Planewalker, published by RDG Music with support by Astral Force and Waveguild. Their musical focus is a deeply entrancing variety of ambient psy-lounge, lovingly flavoured with electric guitar and luscious natural sounds. Dubby grooves and mystic melodies will blissfully carry you away on an otherworldly trip into relaxation and total contentment. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Chaos+Control">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
