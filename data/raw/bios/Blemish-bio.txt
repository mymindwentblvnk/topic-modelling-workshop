1)  Blemish was a Brazilian alternative rock band active from 1998 to 2004. Stemming from Sao Jose dos Campos, the bandâ€™s original lineup consisted of Clovis Tito on vocals/guitars, Daniel Dias on guitar, Ivan Roman on bass and Luis Nonaka on drums.

...After a while Tito and Ivan started talking again, amending their broken friendship and that lead to a wish of reworking their material. During Tito's visits to Brazil in 2008 and 2009 they started re-recording songs, giving them a cutting-edge twist and making them relevant to the present times and to their present selfs. As the band never officially broke up they plan on releasing Blemish's unheard songs and touring Brazil in 2010.
