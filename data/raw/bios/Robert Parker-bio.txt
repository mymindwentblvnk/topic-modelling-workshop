1) Robert Parker (October 14, 1930 – January 19, 2020) was an American R&B singer and musician best known for his 1966 hit, "Barefootin’".
Parker started his career as a saxophonist, playing with Professor Longhair on his hit "Mardi Gras In New Orleans" in 1949. Over the next decade, he played with most of New Orleans’ great musicians, including Fats Domino, Irma Thomas, and Huey “Piano” Smith. By 1958, he had started recording solo, having a local hit with the instrumental "All Night Long".
In 1965 he signed for Nola Records, and had his biggest hit with "Barefootin’", arranged and produced by Wardell Quezergue. This reached #2 on the R&B chart and #7 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Although he continued to record, he failed to repeat his success in terms of sales, and his recording career effectively ended in the 1970s. However, he continued to perform and tour for many more years, remaining especially popular in the UK.
In April 2007, in recognition of his contributions to Louisiana and national music, Robert Parker was inducted into The Louisiana Music Hall Of Fame.
