German Error Message began in 2004 as the solo bedroom-recording project of Louisiana native Paul Kintzing. 
Composed by Kintzing, and sometimes assisted by friends, German Error Message makes lyrically driven homemade music; delicate walls of sound with personal metaphorical and symbolic lyricism and diverse instrumentation. German Error Message creates songs that exist in a realm of feeling that is all their own.
