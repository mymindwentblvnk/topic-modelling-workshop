1. Death Metal Band EXTIRPATION was formed in May 2006 in Essen (Germany) with the objective of making Death Metal like the well known big Death Metal Bands coming from the USA.

Musicians who already had had some experiences playing in underground Metal Bands formed EXTIRPATION within a couple of months.
In November 2007 guitarist Christoph left the band because of his moving back in homeward direction to Hessen. Christoph has been replaced by Jojo.

EXTIRPATION plays fast, grooving and also diversified Death Metal which should be rated on stage!
