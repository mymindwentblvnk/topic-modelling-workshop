Resembling the whole presence in the universe, life itself evolves too, and swings between the edges like a pendulum in the way the darkness and the light do constantly. Time occurs by this swinging of presence and life too finds its meaning in dialectic. Getting inspired from this dialectic, Karasafra set off to explore the ways of wisdom up to the all edges, in 2009. On the tempestuous plains of progressive metal, creating an eclectic music by blending the philosophy and the hard music of North with the spirit and the melodies of Anatolia, Esin TOKGÖZ and Engin Can TOKGÖZ hauled their brotherhood to abstract in the dialectical sound of Karasafra. 

Band's debut E.P. "Chaos Manifest", bears the feature of being the first "Extreme Progressive Metal Project in Turkey". Chaos Manifest, created in the wake of long processes, navigating between light and dark; aggressive and depressive cycles, re-explores the ways wended in the name of wisdom. Chaos Manifest, getting out of conventional music patterns, presents a music which is born of the wavy seas of life.

Esin and Engin Can TOKGÖZ, who have come to their current musical carrier by not only playing in different bands but also exploring the basis of musical progression and arrangement, started the journey of Karasafra in 2009 in the aim of transfering their philosophy and artistic views from their usual debate environment to a concrete grounded product of synthesis. After a 4-years period, the multi-instrumentalist brothers completed "Chaos Manifest". The E.P. got people's admiration and has been offered to the all metal lovers. The duo is continuing to work on new tracks and planning to carry on the path of releasing new material. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Karasafra">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
