Bloodflowerz is a German Gothic Metal/Gothic Rock band formed in 2000 in Schwäbisch Hall, Germany. Since signing to Silverdust Records in 2002, they have released 3 full-length albums and 2 EPs. 

In 2002 Bloodflowerz released their debut album “Diabolic Angel”. After Successfully touring with Anathema, Subway to Sally, and Crematory as well as playing festivals such as Mera Luna and Summer Breeze Bloodflowerz impressed critics all over Germany and Europe as well . Nearly one year later Bloodflowerz released “7 Benedictions / 7 Maledictions“ to strong reviews everywhere.

Two years Later Bloodflowerz returned and after a few line-up changes released “Dark Love Poems” . With a newer, stronger line up and a new album Bloodflowerz came back to the Rock/Metal scene to once empress fans and critics. In the bands own words, “Dark Love Poems is a message to drag along hungry hearts. A manifest which gives a powerful voice to the great emotions with its very own comprehension of Gothic, Rock’n’Roll, Metal and Pop".

In 2007 Bloodflowerz played many festivals all across Europe and signed an endorsement deal with Pyramid Strings. However on Dec. 17, 2007 a posting on Bloodflowerz's website announced that a Dec. 26 concert would be their last as a band. The members intended to stay active in music.
