Sido is the stage name of the Berlin rapper Paul WÃ¼rdig (born November 30th, 1980), one of the most successful artists of the German record label Aggro Berlin. Sido distinguishes himself through uncomfortable, provocative, aggressive lyrics. He often wears a silver mask.

The name is an abbreviation that is spelled as "super-intelligentes Drogenopfer" = "super intelligent drug victim". However this is the new interpretation while originally the name did spell as "Scheisse in Dein Ohr" = "shit (goes) into your ears".

In 2004, Sido's debut album, "Maske" ("Mask"), sold more than 100,000 copies in less than a month. In September of that year, the rapper won a prestigious German music award for "Best Newcomer". The best known song from that album, "Mein Block", describes life in the Maerkisches Viertel, a ghetto-like district of Berlin.

Sido has been spurting a lot of controversies. Most of his personal information is kept under blankets, not even the personal name or birthday is being confirmed by official records. Rumours say that the stage person is fully fictitious including its alleged background in a criminal ghetto. While some of his provocative aggressive songs have been banned many fans like to interpret the lyrics as a satirical on widespread prejudices about the life in so-called "problem districts". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sido">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
