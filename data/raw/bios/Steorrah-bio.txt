Steorrah are a band whose members’ musical background could scarcely be more diverse, stretching from jazz and doom, over classical piano to crude black metal and progressive rock. With these seasonings Steorrah blend their sound while standing kneedeep in death metal, their common denominator. The band’s history goes way back to the late nineteennineties and a band named ‘Catharsis’, a brief but bright flame in their local scene in the ever rain-drenched forests of southernmost Westphalia. Meanwhile hailing from the bonny shores of the Rhine, Steorrah are finishing their debut album ‘An Eroticism In Murder’, an infectuous infusion of doomsday riffs, sophisticated grooves and a sense of tension between jazzlike harmonies and twisted disharmonies embedding a stream-of-consciousness of a lyrical concept. ‘An Eroticism In Murder - A Stream Of Consciousness In D Minor’ is scheduled for release via Sleepcast Records on 8th October 2010 and will be accompanied by a string of stage appearances. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/STEORRAH">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
