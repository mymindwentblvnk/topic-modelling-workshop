Hailing from the Lace City of Nottingham comes Engraved In Blood, a modern day death metal quartet that are said to even have “hints of black metal in the sound.” (Alternative Barnsley) 

Following a highly successful first year of gigging in 2012, which included appearances at BOMfest 2012 and Blast Festival, Engraved In Blood are now set to release their full length debut album Buried In A Forest Of Bodies in July 2013, followed by more shows and festival appearances (Coalfields 2013, Khaos Festival 2013 + more TBC ). During 2012, the band racked up a total of 26 gigs, touring up and down the UK including Sheffield, Nottingham, Ipswich, Hull and Leicester but wish to branch out more during 2013 and beyond.

Engraved In Blood’s current line up consists of James Quartermaine (ex Aonia/From The Depths) on vocals and rhythm guitar, Ralph Ainsworth on lead guitar and Danny Phillips (ex The Modcons) on the drums. The bass position is currently being filled by a variety of session musicians until a permanent bassist can be found. This line-up has been together since March 2012. Although members have come and gone along the band’s journey, they are not forgotten as they contributed their time and efforts to make Engraved In Blood the band they are today.

Going forward, Engraved In Blood are working on getting themselves onto more festival line-ups and spreading their music to new areas of the UK and beyond. With the release of Buried In A Forest Of Bodies, the band plan on recording a music video to help in their quest to reach out to new audiences around the world.
