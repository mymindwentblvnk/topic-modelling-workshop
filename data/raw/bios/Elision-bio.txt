About elision
An elision refers to the least common progression in music theory. Coming together in November of 2004, Elision chose the name because they are trying to do something outside the stereotype of their genre of music. Their first album, "Reflecting on Refraction", is an album about change. Change in direction, both in music and in life. The aching melodies and dark bass lines mix with essences of rock, progressive, and alternative beats. "Reflecting on Refraction" is not an album of 11 non-identifiable songs. Each has its own personality and flavor, just like the guys.

Elision is currently trying to break the mold starting with the one embedded within themselves. We only hope that you too can be open minded as we walk out blindly towards the light. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Elision">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
