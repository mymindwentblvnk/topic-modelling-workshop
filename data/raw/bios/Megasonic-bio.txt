Megasonic is a melodic metal band from Belgium. The band started out as a studio project in 2012 when Jeroen De Bock and Lieven De Wolf teamed up with professional musical singer Dimitri Verhoeven (known from his appearances in ’14-’18, Bloedbroeders, Daens, …) to write and record some powerful melodic metal.  These recordings resulted in the worldwide release of their critically acclaimed debut album “Intense” by the renowned metal label Mausoleum in December 2014.

Because it was hard to perform their music live with just the three of them, Thomas Abeel (bass/ex-Everglow) and Dries Deturck (drums/ex-Monster Joe, ex-Crusader) joined their forces in 2014. Ever since, the band has played several venues and festivals to the satisfaction of both press and audiences.

In October 2017, Megasonic’s second studio album ‘Without Warning’ was released by the Greek label Sleaszy Rider Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Megasonic">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
