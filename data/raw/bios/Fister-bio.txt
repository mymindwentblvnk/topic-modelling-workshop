Fister is a three piece doom metal band from St. Louis, Missouri. The band incorporates heavy influences from the black and death metal genres into a depressing sludge spewing heaviness that many have attempted, but few have mastered. Fister's latest full length 'Gemini' is a testament to this, as the band captured the aural equivalence to watching a Cronenberg film on barbiturates. The band recently reunited with producer/engineer Gabe Usery for their newest installment of dread inducing heaviness as an offering for their newest split with Oregon's Norska.
