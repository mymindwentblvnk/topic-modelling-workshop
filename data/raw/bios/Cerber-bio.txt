There are two bands called CERBER:

First:

"CERBER is a relatively freash creation, formed in 2010. The band has been brought to life by Wisnia- vocalist and Luki- the drummer, shortly after joined by bass player- Tajny.

CERBER is a specific blend of hardcore brutality, groove, sludge/stoner heaviness, and alternative, twisted, melodic playing. Music is supposed to be uncommon, strong, energy-driven, lirycs free of boring cliches and pedestrian subjects.

There are no paths made for CERBER- it marks the world with it's own.

Discography is so far as follows:

"Z Prochu" (From Dust) Demo, 2011
"Mad At The Soul" EP 2012
"Mammothian" EP 2012

Every moment is right to change something, to fuck something up, to reconsider yourself, to write a new piece of awesome music, every moment is good to show someone that you care, to realize how incredible the simplest things are, to gaze at the watch and see seconds passing, to realize how older you get, to die.

There are no better and worse moments, all are exactly the same.

Maybe next one will be the CERBER's moment?"

Second: Russian black/death metal band.
