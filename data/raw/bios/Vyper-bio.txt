Vyper are a forgotten mid-80's band that was typical of the genre, lots of harmonies and killer guitar solos. They had a sound that was similar to a cross between London and the glossiness of the Queen City Kids. 
  Formed in Kansas City, Missouri by Christy Black (vocals, and despite the name, a male), Jacky Foxx (guitar), Robbie Saint (guitar), Rik Brock (bass) and Michael Scott (drums). Their debut album, Prepared To Strike was a great release that featured several heavy rockers. Unfortunately the album went almost completely unnoticed, and the band ended their career after the release of the Afraid Of The Dark mini album. 
  Black resurfaced with a band called Billy The Kid in the late 90's (not to be confused with the MCA band of the same name in the mid-80's), but they never progressed past the demo stage. Scott recorded with Prizoner and joined Ballistic for a short time; the remaining members have all but disappeared.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/VYPER">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
