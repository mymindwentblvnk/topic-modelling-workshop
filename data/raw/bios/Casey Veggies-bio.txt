Casey Joseph Jones (born July 18, 1993), better known by his stage name Casey Veggies, is an American rapper and songwriter from Los Angeles, California. Since 2007, he has released five independent mixtapes under LA clothing and management company Peas & Carrots Intl. His debut studio album, Live & Grow, was released on September 25, 2015. Aside from his solo career, Casey was a founding member of the Los Angeles-based hip hop collective Odd Future.

With his first mixtape project, 2007’s Customized Greatly Vol. 1, the 16 year-old lyricist proved that he had the potential to be more than just another Myspace artist. He followed up that project a year later with Customized Greatly Vol. 2 which produced “I’m Right Here” and “It’s All Good,” two songs that picked up around the city. By junior year, he realized that this was something that he not only wanted, but needed to do. So he traded in the hard wood for the stage, dusted off his rhyme book and started getting even more serious about his music. He was making a name for himself amongst the younger crowd in Los Angeles, but now he has his sights set on greater gains. Vol. 1 was somewhat of an experiment, Vol. 2 a test, but now the teen-aged spitter is ready for graduation.

Sleeping in Class, his third solo project, and arguably his most evolved yet, promises to be a culmination of the lessons he’s learned over the last couple of years. The tape intends to prove that while the young artist is not quite seasoned, his potential is definitely ripe. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Casey+Veggies">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
