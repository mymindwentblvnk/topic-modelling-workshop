Night of Suicide started in 2005. They play a very depressive but melodical type of doom or rather funeral doom. Night of Suicide is an international collaboration between Sepiroth's Ben de Graaff (from The Netherlands) and Markus Heinonen (from Finland). 

So far, the band has released three CD of which the latter - Desire - was released in 2011 on Metalhit records. For the first time ever, the band decided to do two shows in both bandmember's countries, which were well-received. Since then, the band has been working on their upcoming release, due to be finished in 2013.
