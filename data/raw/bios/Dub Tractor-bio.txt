Although ostentatiously considered to be a certain breed of indietronica, Dub Tractor (aka Anders Remmer) unites his love of all things organic and digital with a cohesive integration oft lacking in many of his peers. He's one of the key figures in the electronic community of Copenhagen. Alongside Thomas Knak aka Opiate and Jesper Skaaning aka Acustic, he recorded a string of influencial albums and 12"s under the "System3" moniker and as "System" for scape. Anders Remmer is also a member of Future 3 and was a member of How Do I.
