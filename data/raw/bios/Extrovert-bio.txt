Extrovert is a russian progressive rock/progressive metal band from Irkutsk. It was founded in 1993 as a hard n heavy band Big Trouble. In 1996 they started a close collaboration with Irkutsk State Musical Theater. The famous Russian rock-opera 'Juno and Avos' by Alexey Rybnikov and 'Jesus Christ SuperStar' by Andrew Lloyd Webber were staged featuring the musicians of Big Trouble. In 1999 'Four Elements' — a long awaited album in English - was released in Irkutsk. But in 2000 the band came to the final decision to change their name to "Стихия" (Russian for 'element') and their music genre to progressive rock. They took a permanent keyboardist Dmitry Iskhakov and started working at the new stuff. In 2003 the band entered on recording their first album called Разбудив океан (Russian for Waking the ocean') that was released in 2005. At the same time the band decided to change its name which due to some reasons wasn't appreciated by the musicians. So, after the long search everybody came to the conclusion that from January 1st, 2005 the band's official name would be Extrovert. After several line-up changes the band quit the Musical Theater, recorded the English Demo and began distributing the demo package to different foreign labels together with regular concerts at clubs of Irkutsk and recording a full-length English version of the album.
