Sevenchurch were formed in Oxford in 1990 from the ashes of two local bands; Mordor and Dying Breed. Joined in 1991 by vocalist Martin Speer (ex Madamadam) the band settled down to record its demo "Nefarious", a mixture of the doom of seventies giants like Black Sabbath, the thrash element of the early eighties and the indie scene which was a big part of their home town. In 1993 they singed with Noise international, who released a remix of their demo track "Circus Divine" on the "Louder Than Words" compilation. In October of that year they released their "Bleak Insight" CD, which would prove to be their final offering and the band split soon after.
