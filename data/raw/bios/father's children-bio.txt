This group is/was from DC, and still has the original founding members Bill (Qaadir) Sumler and Ted (Hakeem) Carpenter. There are 3 members who have been with the group for the past 20 or more years. If you know their music, the same lead singers from back in the day are still there. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Father%27s+Children">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
