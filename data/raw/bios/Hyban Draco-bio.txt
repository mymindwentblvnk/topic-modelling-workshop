Hyban Draco was founded in 2004 by hyban Sparda with the objective of recording his own songs. He worked alone waiting for meet good band mates. During its time he recorded some unofficial products. The first members was Hyban Sparda (Voals and guitars), Cristhobal (Guitars)and Oby Mictian (Bass). They were using programming drums during a long time.

With its formation in 2007 they edited  the demos "A Prophecy of Insane" and "Infernal Glory" which were distributed in Europe. Thanks to that they started to be known and Vincent, a drummer who known about them, joined in the band.

"A Prophecy of Insane" had a lots of good reviews in important magazines andit became the first official Hyban draco product.. 
Thanks to that reviews Hyban Draco obtained his first label contract to record their debut CD.

"Frozen Whispers" was the name of the CD but new band-mates appeared. Mike (drums) and Logan (bass) started in the band.
Apparently Oby Mictian had personal problems and he abandoned the band but he is the man who recorded the bass in Frozen Whispers.

Finally, in 2010 the CD was out and the band received good critics again and they obtained a European tour and the possibility to record a new album. During its time Hyban Sparda and Logan won a band competition with Noctisdark, another band where they play.
