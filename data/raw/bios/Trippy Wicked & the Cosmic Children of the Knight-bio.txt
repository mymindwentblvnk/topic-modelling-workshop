Trippy Wicked & the Cosmic Children of the Knight was formed in early 2006 by Chris West, Pete Holland and Paul Fryer in St. Albans, England. The band play a mix of stoner rock, doom metal, sludge and blues. During the first two years they wrote a huge amount of songs, played numerous gigs and made several demo CDs including their first; Make like a Rock and Roll . Over this time they experienced several line up changes and January 2008 saw the band strip back to drums and guitar with core members Pete Holland and Chris West.

In this format they wrote, recorded and self released the album Imaginarianism and made two videos. The first was a cover of the Skip James classic Hard Time Killin Floor Blues and the second was for the song Evil from the album Imaginarianism.

In Autumn 2008 the line up was completed with the addition of bass player Dicky King who had previously played in UK doom band Olde Crone.
