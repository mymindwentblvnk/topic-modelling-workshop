Biography
ALGETIC was founded in 2001 and soon adopted the name GROTESQUE IMPALEMENT. In 2003 the first demo called "Exposition of the Impaled" was released.

After gigs with Necrophagist, Inhumate, Prostitute Disfigurement, Jack Slater and the like, and after having recruited some fresh blood, the MCD "Redeemed by Consumption" was released in 2006. It got very favorable reviews and already showed the basics of the Extreme Death Metal style ALGETIC now stands for. 

More lineup changes followed and in 2011 the band decided to enter Iguana Studios with top-notch engineer Christoph Brandes to record the new masterpiece "Sewer Dynasty". Sick of the obvious associations with a certain Death Metal band from the US, and having realized that the new album was such a quantum leap for the band, a new name was born: ALGETIC! 

ALGETIC is Extreme Death Metal that causes pain in the ear of the untrained listener. Expect "Sewer Dynasty" soon. It will be painful! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Algetic">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
