2) French band from the mid 1970s. Subversion's schizophrenic sensibility is actually pretty far removed from what you might expect from a label principally known for issuing psychotropic electronic rock. No, the only thing Subversion are subverting on their one eponymous LP is a cohesive sonic identity, the variable symphonic rock postures they strike here ranging from dewy early Pulsar-like Floydianisms to genteel loungy jazz rock to Ame Son/Total Issue-style pop prog to clumsy gypsy jazz to abstract electronics with very little in the way of a through-line to tie it all together.

3) Black metal band

4) Sludge band

5) Punk band from St Albans, UK

6) Australian hardcore band

7) A hardsound dj/production duo Milan/Based collaborating since 2007.

8) Death Metal band from Vancouver, Canada. They have three songs which feature on the GRRRR!! Compilation put together and produced by Devin Townsend of Strapping Young Lad fame. The songs are: Prototype, Christ Disruptor and  Prefabricator. Members on the compilation are: Jim Hun - vocals, Walter Mason - guitar, Stuart Carruthers - bass, Derek Rockall - guitar, Jason Mosdell - drums. According to the inner notes, the bass player "has done extensive touring as a hired member of Dave Lomarbdo's (ex-Slayer) Grip Inc."
