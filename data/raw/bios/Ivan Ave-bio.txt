Ivan Ave’s relationship with music started in the CD shelves of his older sisters. Today the Norwegian MC makes songs clearly shaped by sneaking into 90s bedrooms to play albums by The Fugees and Janet Jackson. In the last few years he has put out several EPs, all deeply rooted in the RnB and Hip-Hop of his childhood, perhaps even more the 70s jazz and soul that inspired it. A keen record collector, Ave moonlights as a DJ and two step extraordinaire. 
Ivan signed with Berlin based Jakarta Records in 2014 to release Low Jams, a five track phenomenon produced by Stones Throw artist Mndsgn. The EP was described by Okayplayer.com as “an enveloping head nodder that peppers irresistible grooves with vivid double-entendres and exists in the same elusive strata of true school perfection occupied by Nas’ debut Illmatic LP.” In the fall of 2015 Ivan and long time collaborator Fredfades  released another duo project on Jakarta, entitled Fruitful LP. In february 2016 Ivan’s debut solo LP, produced exclusively by Mndsgn was released. You can find his vivid raps on several features and side projects. From the soulful cassette release with his crew Mutual Intentions, to trading verses with the likes of Blu and Illa J, Ivan Ave is a force to be reckoned with. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ivan+Ave">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
