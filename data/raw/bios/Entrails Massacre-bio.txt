They are a grindcore band based in Rostock (Germany). Founded in 1990, they have continued to put forth over a dozen split albums with other bands, and finally a full length album in 2004, titled "Crucial Strikes with Attitude". Their lyrics are about politics, social issues, anti-war, etc. on the way of Agathocles, Fear Of God, Mesrine, Rot, etc. and strictly musically they continue to make fast, short and direct grindcore / mincecore.
