Sleep White Winter was a duo from San Diego, California, United States. The band formed in late 2011 and a month later released their debut self recorded/produced EP. The duo consists of Gabe Gomez (guitars, piano) and Bradley Tiffin (guitars, bass, piano, harsh vocals, drums). The teenage post black metal band has a wide variety of influences, ranging from the beautiful dream like melodies of shoe-gazing, to the pure blissfulness of post rock, to the teeth grinding fast tempos of black metal. Similarities are most notably seen in bands like Alcest, Katatonia, Opeth, Wolves in the Throne Room, Amesoeurs. The music is intended to induce deep thoughts and to create a portal into the dream world. 

Credit goes to Nick Di Donato for clean vocals on the self-titled EP. 

Their first full-length, Dreamscapes, was released on June 12th, 2013, for free, on the same day they disbanded. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sleep+White+Winter">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
