Protocol IX is a modern metalband from Flanders, Belgium that was founded in the summer of 2004. Back then the band was primarily influenced by Machine Head and Korn. After their first demo the evolved to a more varied mix of groove, melody, hooks and agression. Think a mix of thrash metal, metalcore and nu-metal with different twist. 

One year after the founding of the band, the first demo“Redemption” was finished, and the band received good reactions.Two years later Protocol IX returned with a new EP "In Denial". The band had grown and the music made it clear: the EP showed progress in every way. 

But above all "In Denial" showed what Protocol IX offered: a varied mix of groove, melody, hooks and agression.

The band succesfully did a line of shows, made appearance on TV Brussels and won the demopoll of national radio Studio Brussel. But shortly after that drummer Peter had to leave the band. Finding a fitting drummer wasn't easy at all, and it wasn't until the summer of 2008 that Protocol IX found the drummer they were looking for.

Now, they are hungry to be back on stage and eager to prove themselves. Self confidence has grown a great deal in the new line-up and the belief in the new music is huge. Protocol IX is back on track, make sure you don't miss them!!! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Protocol+IX">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
