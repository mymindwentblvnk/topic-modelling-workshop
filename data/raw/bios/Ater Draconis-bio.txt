Ater Draconis was the solo metal project of guitarist Jamie Roberts.  The project somehow managed to garner a small fanbase and a number of CD sales after an instrumental track (Bastard Children of Death and Life) rose to the top of the MP3.com Gothic Metal charts, back in the site's heydey before it was bought out.  AD's sound was mostly programmed, with the only "real" instruments being guitar and vocals.

Future releases under the name Ater Draconis are possible, though uncertain. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ater+Draconis">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
