A melodic maelstrom that snaps neck as much as it allows the foot to tap, Acrid Semblance make music that incorporates a vicious guitar and rhythm section attack with keyboard flourishes, which has seen their fan base grow ever since their 2003 offering Soul Corrosion, snaked its way into the Indian metal underground. A follow up titled From the oblivion is due to cement their reputation as serious musicians and sure to provide the audience with a hefty dose of power rush

Their name Acrid Semblance means : forms we see when our mind is coloured with acrid information forcing us to see things in light that is presented and the truth is eluded

Hailing from New Delhi, capital city of India, influenced majorly by Children of Bodom, Acrid's music can be classified as Power/Melodic Metal.
