Formed in 2009, Rintrah consists of bassist Jeremy Fleming, guitarist and lead vocalist Brett McKee, drummer Caleb Roney, and guitarist Jason Wright. Rintrah recorded their debut EP "Hold Dear the Ember" in 2010 which was well received. Following the release of their EP, they shared the stage with bands such as RWAKE, Skeletonwitch, and Royal Thunder, successfully making waves in the Nashville metal scene before diving into a deep, dark cave to write their first full-length record. They emerged from hibernation with "Salt of the Earth", a 9-track, 54 minute album recorded by Mikey Allred (Inter Arma, Across Tundras) and mastered by Alan Douches(High on Fire, Baroness, Converge). 

Rintrah's sound runs a wide gamut of styles from stoner and post-metal to progressive and psychedelic. For fans of Baroness, Mastodon, Tool, ISIS, and Queens of the Stone Age. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rintrah">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
