Suruni is lo-fi goodness from Finland.


Low-fi garage apocalyptic music, like when Sonic Youth is jamming with Circle Of Ouroborus 
in acid melancholy somewhere in a deep forest under the sharp eyes of David Lynch.
Rooted somewhere in black metal, noisy, atmospheric, melancholic,
sometimes instrumental, sometimes not.
Also many acoustic parts in the music.

Debut album released in April by Sun & Moon Records,
8 tracks in 38 minutes, available on digipak CD.
