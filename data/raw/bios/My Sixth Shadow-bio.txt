The widely scattered 6th shadow that every human being drops toward the senseless universe reflecting its lonely condition. Like grains of white sand, tightly lying on a desert land. Try to behold your existence. The masks you wear everyday.
The motley-pretending way of appearing that you are so used to. You are just the shadow cast by the real one you keep trapped inside your soul.

"Each shadow represents you in different ways: as the others consider you, as you consider yourself. Who are you definitely? Imagine, just for a while, that everyone conventionally casts four shadows toward the cardinal points and then two shadows, respectively toward the highest side of the sky (heaven, maybe?) and the deepest part of the earth (hell, maybe?). The first shadows represent your daily way of appearing, the last ones represent the true essence of your being. Now it’s up to you to take the final chance: Which is your sixth shadow? Is it the one that waits to soar through the sky above or the other one, the black unconscious slumbering inside of you?" This is the reading key of the My Sixth Shadow world.

Rising from the ashes of “The Masquerade”, My Sixth Shadow was born when Victor and Joseph, while searching for a new vocalist, met Dave who was performing at a club in December 1999. Dave was already playing in a lot of other projects with an impressive
and really personal style. Victor suddenly understood that he found the right singer for a totally brand new band with a different style and approach. After a goth party and a quick listen to the new material (in a car in front of the club), Dave joined the band with
big motivation and lots of ideas to work with. The line up was
ready: Dave (vocals), Victor (Guitars & Backing Vocals), La Nuit (Guitars), Joseph (Bass), and Fet (Drums). The five guys released their 1st self-titled promo EP in the summer of 2000. In November of the same year, Dani joined the band at keyboards, bringing
more electronic atmospheres and romantic piano melodies to the overall sound. During summer 2001, after some performances around Italy and continuous style research, My Sixth Shadow started recording the 5 tracks EP “Sacrifice”.

"Sacrifice" was the result of a new inspiration toward darkwave & gothic atmospheres, featuring electro-shaped sounds surrounded
by powerful 7 strings guitars. A deep and compact work, mixing romantic emotions with aggressive guitar riffing and heavy drum patterns. Something you can call “New Wave Of Gothic Metal”.

The EP was ready in early 2002, released with wonderful packaging and design made by Grace Khold (Neon Trinity Kill). Magazines started to receive the promo-packages on their desks and the feedback was totally enthusiastic. The band obtained top scoring and some features on sampler cds from the European press. Three times the featured band on mp3.com, band of the week on the Viva Text in Germany, band of the month on Psycho!, top scoring reviews on Metal Hammer, Imperiumi, Legacy and then a KKKK scoring on Kerrang UK, definitively confirmed the potential of the band.

A network of fans started to grow up supporting the band in the most incredible ways. In the spring of 2002, My Sixth Shadow released a couple of preview mp3 tracks on mp3.com. “Intoxicate My Heart” and “Shadows In My Love” suddenly reached the top positions on mp3.com charts and held strong for 3 months.

In November 2002, the band started to record in studio a set of 12 brand new tracks. After the recording sessions, the 6 shadows joined Darkwell as support touring in Germany and The Netherlands. Some other shows followed in Italy with Novembre, Death SS and Stormlord. In May 2003 the mix of their self-produced album was ready and the band was just going to release it independently when Voice Of Life records (Germany) contacted and signed the band for a 3 year deal with European distribution.

"10 Steps 2 Your Heart" came out on 18 July 2003, featuring only 5 new tracks of the 12 track set and 5 tracks of the old EP “Sacrifice”. Released as a “preview” of the real debut album (supposed to be released during 2004), the band received again great response from the European press (Orkus, Metal Heart, Metal Observer, Metal.de, Imperiumi, and Rockhard) and performed several live shows during 2003 to promote the release.

After an intense song writing period from spring until winter of 2003, the songs selected for the real debut album were ready in demo version. Only one track of the old set was included in the
new album track list (Shadows In My Love). In the meantime
Victor founded a new band, Dope Stars Inc. (Industrial/ Ebm/ Metal), together with the Grace Khold that designed the 10 Steps
2 Your Heart artwork. The “Love-fading Innocence” recordings started in January 2004 at the Subsound Records studios. The
pre-master was ready in April 2004.

The ultimate sound of the band was achieved: An incredible mix of deathrock/darkwave obscure sounds, mixed with modern shaped heavy metal influences, electro sounds and gothic/punk attitude. It was as though Bauhaus, Christian Death, Metallica, My Dying Bride, Paradise Lost, Depeche Mode and In Flames working together developing a new style. You can’t describe fully, with few words, such a wide mix of influences. You can just let My Sixth Shadow surround you and feel the passion behind it.

During the summer of 2004, the band decided to terminate the record deal with its label and started to submit the pre-master
of the album to some other record labels. After a short time,
Watch Me Fall records recognized the potential of the new songs
and signed My Sixth Shadow for a new album in November 2004.

"Love-Fading Innocence", mastered by Mika Jussila at Finnvox Studios (Finland), packed with excellent artwork designed by
Grace Khold, will come out in January 2005 and marketed worldwide by Masterpiece Distribution. A promotional tour is close to being arranged for spring 2005 to promote the new album release. A brand new website featuring lots of multimedia improvements and the official street team will be uploaded soon.
