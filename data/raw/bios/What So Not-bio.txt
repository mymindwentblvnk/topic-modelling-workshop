The duo released the song, "Jaguar" on 6 December 2013.
On 24 June 2014, What So Not and RL Grime released their single, "Tell Me", with Chris Martins from Spin describing the track as "of both melodic might and percussive ferocity".

On 20 February 2015, Flume announced that he has departed from the What So Not project, citing creative differences. In a post written on Facebook, What So Not stated that "over the last while, Emoh and I have been moving in different directions creatively, we haven't made any music together in quite a while", and thanked Flume for his time and effort put into the project.
"Gemini" which features George Maple, the first track from the Gemini EP, debuted on 9 May 2015. The track was named on Triple J Hottest 100 later that year and peaked at number 52 on the Australian Singles Chart. The lead and title track features Sydney-based singer George Maple.

Gemini was released as a free download on 18 December 2015, which featured collaborations with artists Dillon Francis, Tunji Ige and KLP (musician). The EP was downloaded over 800,000 times, charted globally on iTunes Electronic EP chart and was named to various year-end "best of" lists.
In November 2015, What So Not, Baauer and George Maple co-produced a track for Australian rapper Tkay Maidza, titled "Ghost". The song was premiered on Triple J.

On 3 November 2016, RL Grime released the single "Waiting" in collaboration with What So Not and Skrillex which was in production since 2013. The track's release was teased through a promotional video which parodied chat-line advertisements and featured footage of 1980-era-influenced vixens with a phone number flashing across the screen, where by calling the number listeners can hear the song in full.
A collaboration between What So Not and New York artist LPX, "Better", was released on 8 September 2017; and was debuted on Australian Radio Station Triple J 7 September 2017. "I had a few productions Iâ€™d been working on in this sonic field but struggled to find a vocalist with the right attitude and tone to fit. Lizzy and I clicked instantly on this trajectory & began jamming on the tune," stated What So Not about the track's production. He released "Be Ok Again" which featured Australian musician Daniel Johns on 28 November 2017. The track was produced after Johns noticed What So Not working with Slumberjack as he walked by the studio, which prompted him to invite What So Not to work together at his Newscastle studio.
On 31 January 2018, What So Not announced the arrival of his debut album titled Not All the Beautiful Things which was released on 9 March 2018.
