Messer is a post-punk band from Germany  formed in 2011.

whose name means “knife” in English, is one group that falls into the latter category.

According to lead singer Hendrik Otremba, German is the only language he can adequately use to describe his feelings, being that it’s his native tongue. And that logic carries over into the music he himself listens to.
