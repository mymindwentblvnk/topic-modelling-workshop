Eero Johannes is a one-man synthetic funk orchestra. His background as a drummer and a bassist has a fundamental part in building the electronic, "sugarhigh" grooves for the dancefloor. His first experiments with electronic music started with tracker software, his interests gradually evolving towards midi-oriented sequencers and playing live. His live performance, always partially improvised, indeed will make both girls' and boys' hearts throb. He's all about crisp electronic cuteness; bass of grime, Miami and chic; topping it off with a keytar serenade. His debut album was released in September 2008 at Planet Mu Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Eero+Johannes">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
