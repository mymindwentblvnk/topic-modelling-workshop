The Shortwave Set are a British psychedelic pop band who combine samples and songs to create a sound the group describe as "Victorian Funk". Their debut album, The Debt Collection, was released in 2005 on Independiente/Sony.

The band consists of Andrew Pettitt (songwriter, lyrics, vocals, guitar), Ulrika Bjorsne (lead vocals, guitar) and David Farrell (samples, decks). They formed in 2003 in London, though Ulrika Bjorsne is originally from Alstermo in southern Sweden. They have toured with Goldfrapp, Rilo Kiley and Gnarls Barkley. Danger Mouse, hip-hop producer and one half of Gnarls Barkley, has described the band as his favourite contemporary group.

Their London club night, The Pawn Shop, features a tombola, compere, and DJ sets comprising entirely of records purchased in charity shops.

They are managed by the legendary Roger Dunwoody
