Wine From Tears is a melodic death doom metal band from Samara, Russia. Wine From Tears' style can be described as a mix of Saturnus, Draconian, My Dying Bride, Katatonia and Swallow The Sun.

The band was founded in September 2002 by A.Kudrashov and A.Nesterov. Since then the band's structure changed a lot: D.Ochkov (keyboards), who joined in 2003, played in the band at it's first concert. It took place in the night-club called "Manhattan", it was "Death party (in memory of Chuck Schuldinner)".

Rhythm-section changed in January 2004: Oksana Poudanina (bass) and Igor Andreev (drums) were invited. Later Alexandr Jurasov joined the band as a vocalist. D.Ochkov left WFT in April 2004. Olga Chekmareva (keyboards) changed him (took over). In July 2004 the band decided to change O.Poudanina (bass) for Andrew Meunargia (bass, ex-WFT). But a bit later Andrew left the band. He was changed by Elena Firsova (bass). Two months later O.Chekmareva (keyboards) decided to leave WFT and asked D.Ochkov to come back. In spring 2008 Alex Nesterov (giutars) took a role of a singer (took over singer's duties). In September 2008 Maria Zvjagina came in as a keyboard player.

First album, "Through The Eyes Of A Mad", was released in March 2009 on the Bad Mood Man Music (sub-label Solitude Prod.)
