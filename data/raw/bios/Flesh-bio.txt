There are numerous groups going by the name of Flesh:

1. FLESH Manchester based FLESH construct an infectious combo of previously clashing guitar worlds of the 1990s. Sonically, they layer the creaming, show-off solos of Steve Vai over a twisted take on Oasis/Stone Roses-esque madchester beats with a dry, Nirvana-like ethic, ringing every last sweaty drop out of the mundane Britain.

2.  Flesh is the only Heavy Metal band from Croatia. They were known as Full Throttle (2004- 2013). In March 2014, they released their first LP ''Flesh'' with ''Vermin Terror'' as main album single. Among critics and audience, their self- titled LP is gaining it's status as one of the best metal releases in Croatia recently.

3. (FLESH) is Jason Watkins of Los Angeles 

4. A Swedish death metal band, featuring Pete Flesh (aka Peter Karlsson) - Vocals, Guitar, Bass (Maze of Torment, Deceiver (Swe), Thrown), Flingan - Session Drums (Deceiver (Swe)), session bass for live shows: Crille Lundin (Deceiver (Swe), Thrown).
* as of June 13th 2009 the name was officially changed to: ''The Pete Flesh Deathtrip'' due to legalities and coupled with the fact that Flingan will no longer be playing drums. Pete Flesh will now handle the drums himself making it a 100% solo project.

5. A Canadian psychobilly band.

6. A Japanese protopunk band.

7. A Boston, MA heavy metal band that released a 2 song demo in 1989.

8. An American hard / funk rock band, featuring Paulo Bettencourt & Markus Cherone (brothers of Extreme's Nuno Bettencourt & Gary Cherone). They have released 2 albums so far: Flesh in 1994 & The Lost Book Of Malchus in 2006. Flesh were the first band signed by Colorblind Records, owned by Nuno Bettencourt

9. Emerging French electro duo Flesh Two enraged guys creating an electric, exhilarating, almost brutal atmosphere through their songs. On stage, the acoustic drum sound mixed to the rough synth sonic waves manages to create the same kind of power you can find in a rock band. But don't get them wrong, Flesh sure knows how to make you fall into the kind of night.
