Shonen Knife (少年ナイフ) is an all-female Japanese pop punk band formed in Osaka, Japan in 1981. Heavily influenced by 1960s girl groups and early punk rock bands such as The Ramones. The trio rose from humble DIY beginnings to touring with Nirvana on their ‘Nevermind’ tour, trailblazing a path for women in music and inspiring legions of bands. Championed by Nirvana, Sonic Youth and hailed as a favourite by the crème-de-la-crème of Alternative Rock, Shonen Knife remain one of the most influential and beloved of Japanese rock exports.
Now in their 33'rd year the band are to release their 20th album 'Overdrive' on 4 records labels worldwide (P-Vine (Japan), Damnably (UK/Europe), Good Charamel (America) and Valve (Austrialia))

Live, they are a tight with machine-precision, punching out fast, highly exciting sets of Punk, Pop, Rock & Metal hits, all coated with their own distinctively quirky and life-affirming charm. As they fast approach their 1,000th gig, Shonen Knife’s joy and invention shows no sign of fading. As Naoko says, “Let’s Rock!”

They have also performed as a Ramones tribute band under the name The Osaka Ramones and released an album of Ramones covers under that name.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Shonen+Knife">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
