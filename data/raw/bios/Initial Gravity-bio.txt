INITIAL GRAVITY is a progressive metal band, formed in San Miguel de Tucuman City, Argentina, in 2005, by Isaac LLOVERA (keyboards) and Facundo MACCIO (lead guitar). The band was completed with the addition of Bernardo Yacono (drums) and Mariano AZUBEL (bass). However, the addition of a bass player was not easy and before AZUBEL joining, the band had Xavier MOYANO playing the bass for recording and mixing an instrumental 2-track demo, recorded in XM Studio Center.

The band decided to evolve further from being an instrumental group by adding singer Alvaro BARCELLONA in 2008 and shortly after, Isaac LLOVERA leaves the group for personal reasons, to be replaced by John Paul NAVARRO. With this line-up, the group started recording their debut album in 2009. In 2010 and after completing the vocals for the album, BARCELLONA quit the band and was replaced by Leandro LOPEZ. In 2011 they finally released their debut album "Lost" and made it available for free download. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Initial+Gravity">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
