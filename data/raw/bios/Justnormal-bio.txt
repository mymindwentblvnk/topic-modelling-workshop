Justnormal is the beatmaker you hear at your coffeeshop or at 2am in your car. The glue between jazz and hip hop forcing slow head bobs. With moody and longing melodies over sparse drums, Justnormal provides the soundtrack to your every day life. The electronic beats let listeners sonically escape as soon as the vinyl hiss plays. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Justnormal">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
