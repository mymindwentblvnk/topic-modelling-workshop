MadHatter considers himself an “everyman” in the underground entertainment business. While he openly claims not be the best at what he does, he does put in an unbelievable amount of effort into his work and strives to do better. Always learning, always evolving, he not only runs the Scrub Club label, he also produces music, records and mixes albums, spits complex, mathematical flows, contributes artwork both digital and traditional, does graphics design for the site and printed products, builds and keeps all of the Scrub sites updated, creates gaming mechanics, handles promotions and public relations including booking, runs audio / visual equipment, runs printing presses, and lots of other tasks that most labels have to outsource. It’s a lot of work, but keeping Scrub Club going is just as important to him as taking care of a step family. Except… a good step family.

He has gained awards and achievements both big and small for his music, played a few dozen shows, helped other artists out with unending support, and is the well-known “good guy” in the independent scene.

Into the music game since 2001 and an always dedicated worker in the official day job market, he knows a great deal on how to handle business and make good development decisions and hopes to someday to run an all-ages entertainment venue that features art, spoken word, live music, and food fit for fat kids like himself. That way, he can keep on supporting his vision as well as helping out as many other artists as he possibly can.

Scrub Club is his dream, and he has already accomplished what he sent out to do in the first place… changed the life of at least one person with his music. Now that he has what he’s always wanted, he drives forward to enjoy the rest of the ride. It’s all plus, baby! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Madhatter">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
