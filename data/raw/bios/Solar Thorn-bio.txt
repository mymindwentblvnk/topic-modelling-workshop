Solar Thorn was formed in Hobart, Tasmania in early 2005. Their sound has been described as “extreme metal with dark, melodic aspects.”

Over the past year or so, Solar Thorn have supported/gigged with bands such as Psycroptic, Blood Duster, Nevetherym, Leicohtica, Beyond Terror Beyond Grace, Kisstroyer (Australia's No.1 Kiss tribute band) + lots of local bands.

In early 2008, a record company in New South Wales called ‘Metal Asylum Records’ approached Solar Thorn, asking if they would like to come up to Sydney to record a song for a metal/rock compilation CD they were producing. Accepting the offer, Solar Thorn headed to Sound Shaft Recording Studio to record ‘Breath Of Winter’. The CD will be sold in the U.S, Australia, Greece, Japan, France & the U.K.

Writing their own material, and performing at local venues regularly, Solar Thorn have compiled 10 songs to record for their first album. It will be out in late 2008. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Solar+Thorn">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
