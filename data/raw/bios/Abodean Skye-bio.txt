Abodean Skye is a progressive rock/metal project started by multi-instrumentalist and producer Bogdan Vera. Formed in 2008, the project presents an eclectic mix of styles, ranging from classic prog rock, such as ELP and Pink Floyd, to ambient electronica, folk, power and progressive metal. Abodean Skye's sound is a combination of heavy guitar riffs, lush synthesizers and soaring voices, and the lyrics focus on themes such as science fiction and fantasy, as well as social issues. The first Abodean Skye album, Transmission, features the talents of four singers: Will Shaw Mike Gorham Ovidiu Turcu Ashavari Joshi 'Transmission' had a protracted development process, with many lineup changes, but finally the album is done, and ready for release. 'Transmission' will be released under a lenient license that allows free sharing and modification, inspired by open source software and Richard Stallman's GPL project. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Abodean+Skye">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
