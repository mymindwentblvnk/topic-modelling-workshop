Littl'ans are an English alternative band who have had marginal success in their short time performing.

The Littl'ans consist of Andrew Aveling on vocals/guitar, Alex Mahood on lead guitar, Ryan Blagrove on bass and Ben Clarke on drums/vocals.

They supported Babyshambles on their autumn 2005 tour[1] alongside playing other dates with them in 2006, and embarked on their own Club NME tour nationwide in the late months of 2005.[2]

They released a single with Pete Doherty titled "Their Way" on October 17, 2005. Written by Aveling, Doherty liked the song so much he asked to sing on it. Many wrongly have reported Doherty wrote and performed this song as an apology for "stealing" Babyshambles band members Patrick Walden and Adam Ficek from Aveling's old band, The White Sport. This is false, as The White Sport had broken up before Walden had joined Babyshambles, and Ficek did not join until later in Babyshambles career. The song reached number 22 in the pop charts[3] and number 2 in the indie charts.

Littl'ans have also been strongly linked with Hedi Slimane, head designer for Dior Homme. Littl'ans wrote the soundtrack to the Dior Homme Spring/Summer 07 catwalk show. The song was called "We Look Good Together" and band member Ronnie Joice, who is no longer in the group, also modelled in the show. He has also recorded an art piece with Hedi Slimane called "Portrait of a Performer" which has been shown in galleries in Paris and Zurich. He now fronts a group called No Picasso with former member, Ben Hutchinson.

Littl'ans have recently returned from New York, after recording their debut album there. The album is due out on Warmer Records (USA), approximately February 2008. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/The+Litt%27lans">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
