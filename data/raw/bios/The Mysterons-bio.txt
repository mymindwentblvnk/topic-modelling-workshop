There're at least two bands called The Mysterons:

1. The Mysterons are a Dutch psychedelic rockband based in Amsterdam, featuring members of Jungle by Night and singer Josephine van Schaik. Their début EP was released in April 2015; their début full-length, Meandering, in early 2017.

2. The Mysterons were a Canadian band, active from 1990 until 2010 and based in Vancouver. The group was founded by Schatzie Boneslide (guitar, bass) and Mr. Fist (guitar, bass, keyboards). The Mysterons plummed the depths of "instrumental" music looking for a nasty groove. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Mysterons">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
