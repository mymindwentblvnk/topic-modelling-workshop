Wasuremono are an awesome foursome from the South-West of the United Kingdom: an indie band with eight hands.

Likened to Wild Beasts, Slowdive and Arcade Fire, Wasuremonoâ€™s sound has been described as "rich sky-scraping pop with beautiful melancholic lyrics (...) bringing together aspects of pop, indie and dreamscape." Their ever-developing live show incorporates intricate guitar styles and soundscapes, synths played by hands and feet and choral harmonies.
 
Within a year of the band forming their music has been played on BBC Radio 2 and BBC6 Music. They are currently recording their debut album with Grammy-award winning duo Ian Dowling (Catfish and The Bottlemen, Bombay Bicycle Club, Adele) and Guy Massie (The Libertines, Palma Violets).
