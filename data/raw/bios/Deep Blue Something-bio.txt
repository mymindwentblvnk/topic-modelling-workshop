Deep Blue Something is an American rock band best known for its hit single, Breakfast at Tiffany's. The group was founded in 1993 in Denton, Texas by students Todd and Toby Pipes, Kirk Tatum, and John Kirtland.

In 1996, Breakfast at Tiffany's, which referenced the classic Audrey Hepburn film of the same name, reached the top five in the U.S. and number one in the United Kingdom.

There was conjecture that the band took so much time off between Home and Deep Blue Something in order to fight US centered copyright issues related to their initial album, 11th Song, which they believed to be of lower quality than their name deserved. The 7 year hiatus between albums is believed to be partially responsible for their failure to succeed in the US with their self-titled release.

The band returned in 2015 to release new music for the first time since 2001. This EP was titled Locust House.

John Kirtland is now running a successful independent record label called Kirtland Records. Based out of Dallas, Texas and Los Angeles, California, Kirtland's shrewd business dealings led to his ownership of the back-catalog of superstar band, Bush and royalty rights on the sales of certain albums by No Doubt. After selling off his rights to the No Doubt material, Bush remains on the Kirtland label along with successful indies like Bril and the Burden Brothers. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Deep+Blue+Something">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
