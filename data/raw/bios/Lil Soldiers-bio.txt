Lil Soldiers was a short-lived rap group signed to No Limit Records whose members were siblings Ikeim and Freequon. The duo first appeared on fellow No Limit recording artists, Steady Mobb'n's 1998 Black Mafia album on the track entitled "Lil' Niggas". The following year Ikeim and Freequon, who were only nine and seven years old repectively, released their one and only album entitled Boot Camp. The album wasn't as successful as other No Limit albums released during that time and only made it to #80 on the Billboard 200 and #22 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums, shortly after the album was released, Lil' Soldiers were dropped from the label and have not been heard from since. No Limit would later gain better success with another child rapper two years later named Lil' Romeo. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lil+Soldiers">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
