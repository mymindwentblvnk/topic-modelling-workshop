Founded back in 1997 Exposed Guts developed from a quite primitive Gore Grind Band to a technical Death Metal act which focuses not just on being brutal, but also on memorable melodies and catchy song structures. Three demos came out, before the guys finally released their first full-length CD entitled “The Way OF Flesh” in 2003. Press reactions to that release have mostly been extraordinary positive. Due to extensive touring throughout Germany and it’s neighboring countries Exposed Guts managed to spread their sound widely within the international Death Metal underground On the road they shared stages with legends like CYNIC, DEICIDE,MONSTROSITY, MACABRE, MASTER as well as other established acts like ABORTED, SEVERE TORTURE, WACO JESUS, GOD DETHRONED and PURGATORY.

Exposed Guts play US-styled Death Metal. Their main influences obviously are bands like DEATH, PESTILENCE, GORGUTS and similar 90s acts, but besides that their sound also contains some ingredients from Swedish styled Death Metal as well as Thrash Metal. The band is willing to continue its way through musical evolution in order to create a unique and recognizable own sound within the scene. No compromise, no restrictions or whatever, just pure fuckin’ Metal! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Exposed+Guts">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
