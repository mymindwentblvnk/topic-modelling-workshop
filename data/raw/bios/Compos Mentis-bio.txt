COMPOS MENTIS (http://composmentis.dk/) released their debut album Fragments of a Withered Dream in January 2003 through the American label Lost Disciple Records, with which COMPOS MENTIS signed a record contract in 2001 after having released the highly acclaimed MCD Quadrology of Sorrow in 2000.
Fragments of a Withered Dream received great response from the worldwide media, e.g. Legacy magazine (D) 13/15, Xtreem Music (E) 9/10, Danish Metal (DK) 5/6 etc. Furthermore the album was rated as the second best album in the Danish Metal Awards 2003 by the readers of Danish Metal.
The music on the album is best described as melodic death/black metal with very catchy parts and interaction between the guitars and the keyboard. The title and artwork refers to the lyrical concept on the album, which is mainly about self-deception and illusions of life, and each of the lyrics represents a fragment of some person's now withered dream.
During the last years COMPOS MENTIS have played many shows with different bands, such as:
Illdisposed, Withering Surface, Hatesphere, Saturnus, Thorium, Mnemic, Illnath, Exmortemâ€¦
In September 2003 COMPOS MENTIS went on a European tour with Danish metallers Illdisposed to promote the album.
In the live situation the band focuses on the energetic aspect of the music and their shows are dominated by great contact with the audience.
