Assyria is a local Death Metal Band that reigns over the Kitchener-Waterloo area (Ontario Canada).

The band is lead by Toban Jestin and his rabid screaming. His noble assistants include savage guitarists Christian Andersen (lead) and Mark Schultz (back-up) as well as Kyle Briere an influential drummer.

Together this band had been able to put all other local metal bands to shame, as well as build up a solid following of local minions and worshipers by playing at Coffee Houses and Shows at school and around the area.

Since there birth in 2005 there has been several line-up changes but their dedication has always remained the same. Through technically perfecting their skills they have recently been able to release a five song demo, The Age of Awareness. This CD has the ability to lull you to sleep like Metallicaâ€™s Lullabies while visions of demons dance in you heads.
Assyria should not go on unheard of because their perfection and uniquely influenced sound is what other metal bands have strived to create.
