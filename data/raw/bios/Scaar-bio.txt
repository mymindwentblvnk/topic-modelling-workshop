"Swedish metal-band SCAAR was formed by guitarist Alf Johansson and singer Alex Jonsson in early 1999. Bassplayer Mats Vassfjord and drummer Richard Holmgren joined shortly thereafter to complete the lineup. All four members have been active in numerous local bands in the Eskilstuna/Västerås-area for years, before joining forces to form SCAAR.

Live, SCAAR can be described as nothing short of energetic, hard-hitting and in-your-face!

The band has gotten recognition and raving reviews for both the live-spectacle they put on, as well as for their studio-efforts in papers and magazines from all over the world.

A new album is out right now on Karmageddon media, called 'The Second Incision'.

In May of 2005 we parted ways with drummer Richard who was replaced in July with Kristian Huotari." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Scaar">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
