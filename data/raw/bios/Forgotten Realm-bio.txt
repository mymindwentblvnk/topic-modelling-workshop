The current line-up of FORGOTTEN REALM was formed in October 2005 when guitar virtuoso Matthew Mills and bassist Brian Sanders approached legendary rock vocalist David Fefolt (VALHALLA,HAWK,MASI) to write and record a few demo songs. Soon after the three started compiling songs, they realized they had a certain formula that seemed to work very well. Matthew and Brian based in Woodbridge, Virginia would record the music, and email it to David in Phoenix, Arizona who would finish the songs with lyrics and melodies. The long distance writing situation seemed to work so well that David decided to become an official member of the band.

Now running at full speed, the only thing lacking was a drummer to finish the line-up. After more than one unsuccessful attempt at local drummers, David decided to pull out the big guns and contact ex-MAN-O-WAR and current HOLYHELL drummer Rhino. Rhino flew into Phoenix to finish tracking the debut album "Power and Glory" recorded at the Saltmine studios in Mesa, AZ and mixed at Assemblyline Studios in Vienna, VA.

Also worth noting, David's longtime friend and ex-bandmate Reynold "Butch" Carlson (JAG PANZER,JOEY TAFOLLA) sat in on the drums for two songs.

Two years in the making, the result is an album worthy of the "PowerMetal" moniker with Matthew's mind-boggling arpeggios, David's heart pounding vocals, and the cannon-like rhythm section of Brian and Rhino. "Power and Glory" is destined to be one of 2008's heaviest hitting albums and FORGOTTEN REALM are destined for power and glory!!
