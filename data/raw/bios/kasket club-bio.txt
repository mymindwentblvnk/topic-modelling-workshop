Tobias Gautier Teigen, Mattis Syvertsen and Thomas Vesseltun from Oslo, Norway. Started making music together in the beginning of summer 2012 using acoustic instruments combined with electronic beats. We are and have been influenced by very many different artists and bands from a great variety of genres. We have always listened a lot to chillwave acts such as Washed Out and Toro y Moi, but we love the French house of Lem√¢itre and Breakbot as well. We have also probably been influenced by Cut Copy, Foals and Phoenix
