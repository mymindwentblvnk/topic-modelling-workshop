Formed in late 2014, Launceston (Australia) based death metal trio, Plague of Sickness are a dirty and brutal traditional Death Metal band of fast-paced riffs and guttural vocals. As their name suggests, their work encompasses the dark and gruesome subject matter the genre first became known for, with tracks such as ‘Condemned at Birth‘ and ‘For your Misery.‘ Guitarist Jack Hrycyszyn leads the crunchy assault, as well as taking on vocal duties.

Influences include Cannibal Corpse, Carcass and Slayer. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Plague+Of+Sickness">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
