Doctor Cyclops is a seventies-style power trio performing heavy rock music inspired by a vintage sound, eldest son of glorious Black Sabbath and of other more underground heroes from the 70s and early 80s such as Truth and janey, Sir Lord Baltimore, Captain Beyond, Witchfinder General. Even later and more modern references are warm-vintage style ones: Witchcraft, Firebird, Cathedral, Spiritual Beggars just to say some.

Doctor Cyclopsâ€™ music is an obscure kind of heavy old style rock, its groove made by a miscellanous heap mix of influences, which go from the progressive to the doom stuff played with a raw and dusty wish.
