In all of his creative activities, Tristan Perich is inspired by the aesthetics of math and physics, and works with simple forms and complex systems. The challenge of elegance provokes his work in acoustic and electronic music, and physical and digital art. A recipient of the 2008 People's Commissioning Fund, Perich has released his electronics-in-a-cd-case album "1-Bit Music" on Cantaloupe Music and his compositions have been performed by ensembles including Bang on a Can, the Calder Quartet, Hunter-Gatherer and Ensemble Pamplemousse at venues from the Whitney Museum, P.S.1, Mass MoCA, and Merkin Hall to Los Angeles' Zipper Hall. Perich studied math, music and computer science at Columbia University after attending Philips Academy, Andover. More recently, he studied art, music and electronics at the Interactive Telecommunications Program at Tisch School of the Arts, NYU.
