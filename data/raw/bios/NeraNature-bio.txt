NeraNature was founded in 2009 by Nera, a singer so far associated with the Polish metal band Darzamat. The project appeared as a space where the air is filled with matters lingering in her head, a bit more intimate, private and sometimes bizarre and freakish. -I've been waiting for a long time for the right place and time to find an outlet for my personal thoughts and beliefs. This is the time and place – explains Nera.
The name of the band is a combination of two words: Nera, as the nickname of the vocalist, and Nature, as a reflection of a deep connection with the environment. It can also be interpreted as the nature of Nera – a diversity of views reflected in the songs. The feminine character of lyrics imbued with the feminist outlook on life constitutes one the most significant elements of the projects, touching upon such issues as man’s detachment from nature and running away from himself/herself. 
The album is entitled "Foresting Wounds" and it contains 11 compositions based on rock music.
There are two people apart from the singer who helped the album take the present form: in the first moths of the works on the album it was Chris (Darzamat) who helped with putting the pieces together and the last months it was Jarosław Toifl who took care of the final version and the sound of the album.
The debut album will be released on May 9th by a Polish label, Metal Mind Productions. Earlier, in April, there will be a radio single entitled "Shattered, " which will promote the album along with the cover song "The World is Not Enough", from the repertoire of the band Garbage.
