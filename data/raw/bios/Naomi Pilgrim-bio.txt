Swedish/Barbadian chanteuse Naomi Pilgrim has just released her debut track “No Gun” and it is quite a delightful treat. While Pilgrim’s name may be unfamiliar to most, she has been establishing herself as a fledgling musician and backup vocalist for a while now, most notably for Lykke Li. “No Gun” is a soul-pop hybrid with Balearic undertones, making it as interesting and enigmatic as Pilgrim herself. The debut track is already heating up the charts over at the Hype Machine — last we checked it was sitting at #35 — so don’t be late to the party on this one! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Naomi+Pilgrim">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
