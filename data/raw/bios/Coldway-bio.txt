The band was formed in late 2001 by Markus Pitkänen (guitar), Tero Konola (bass) and Joni Salo (drums) in Tornio, Finland. The early style was more hardcore/metal type, but it soon changed to modern death metal. In June 2003 Jonas Sjödin joined the band as a vocalist and things started happening. In February 2004, Jouni Gauriloff (2nd guitar) joined the band. Joni Salo soon left the band and Tero Konola jumped behind the drumkit. Juhani Impiö joined in as a bass player in July 2004. In autumn 2004, during the recording of the first demo, Jouni Gauriloff was replaced by Risto Ruotsalainen on guitar.

When the demo was finished and a gig was played in 2004, Jonas Sjödin decided to leave the band. Mikko Nikula was soon discovered and taken in as the new vocalist. In early 2005, the band started working on a new demo and it was finished in March 2005. However, Risto Ruotsalainen left the band after a few gigs, and Juha Untinen joined the band in spring 2005 on guitar. In late 2005, Juhani Impiö was out of the band and Tero Konola moved back to bass. In 2006, Ville Miinala joined the band as a drummer. The third demo was done and released in summer 2006, calling it Deathwish Overload. In April 2007, the band decided it was done and they split up.
