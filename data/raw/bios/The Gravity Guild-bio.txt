"The Gravity Guild has it all. The sound, the songs, the chops. They remind me of what you would get if you crossed Audioslave with Sevendust. Clearly lethal, but completely addictive."
-Susan Masino

"The Gravity Guild is an LA power trio with a dirty, slow burn sound that would appeal to fans of southern hard rock or classic grungemasters Soundgarden and Alice in Chains. Check em out!"
-Mojo's Army
