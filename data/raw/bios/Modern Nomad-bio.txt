Modern Nomad is the recording project of Maryland native Tom McLean who has been releasing music since 2014. His songs draw influence from The Beatles, Dr. Dog, The Beach Boys and Tame Impala to name a few.

So far, publications have unanimously praised Modern Nomad’s efforts. Brooklyn-based Pond Magazine says he “Flirts with Brilliance,” while D.C.’s 9:30 Club notes, “Modern Nomad is certainly worth checking out.”

McLean is constantly writing and recording new music. While doing the majority of the recording solo, McLean has formed a band which has been performing since 2015. ~ Carl Pietrusinski, POND
