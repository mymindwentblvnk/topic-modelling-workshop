Spinecrusher was formed in December 2008 at the initiative of guitarist Daniel Gheorghiu, drummer Matei Gheorghe (former members of Desolation Decay), and bass player Radu Nastase. Heavily influenced by death/thrash /black metal, the three wanting to further pursue their musical career by enrolling two new members in the band, guitarist Stefan Pascu and Andrei Radulescu on lead vocals.
The band made its first live appearance on the 30th of October 2011, in Fabrica Club, sharing the stage with Necrodeath and Riul Doamnei.
In the summer of 2012, on the 3rd of August, after just four years with the band, lead vocalist Andrei Radulescu decides to leave the group and shortly after this departure, with 4 new members, he started a new band called Violesson. After a few weeks of harsh auditions, Spinecrusher adds Bony, the ex-mastermind of infamous thrash metal act Snapjaw, as the new lead vocals of the band and they made a major change in image, using masks and body paint.
