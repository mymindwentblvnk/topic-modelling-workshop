Chicago emcee ShowYouSuck is putting his mark on the music world, one skateboarder at a time, with his mad hooks, slick rhymes and thought-provoking lyrics. He's straight from the hood, but youâ€™d never guess it with his board-toting, fashion-conscious personality and nack for 80s and 90s pop culture. In April 2011, ShowYouSuck released the mixtape 'OneManPizzaParty', followed by 'OMPP2: Mo Slices Mo Problems' a few months later in December. 'OMPP2' includes the popular song "Hunter Hearst Helmsley (HomiesHelpHomies)" feat. Auggie the 9th. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/ShowYouSuck">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
