Bugzy Malone (born Aaron Davis on 20 December 1990), is an English grime rapper from Manchester. Malone has been described as one of the key MCs instigating a "grime revival" moving the UK urban scene away from more commercially oriented music and the first rapper in the grime genre from Manchester to have commercial success in the UK.

2015 was an outstanding year for Malone, gaining plenty of attention and racking up over 10 million views on YouTube for his freestyles and raw music videos. He was the first artist in history to have the fastest ever ‘Fire in the Booth’ freestyle to get a million views.

In May 2015, Bugzy teamed up with Brit Award winner Tinie Tempah and Mobo Award winner Stormzy on the track ‘It’s Peak’ and the buzz continued as in July 2015 Bugzy released his first E.P ‘Walk With Me’. Which included the singles ‘Watch Your Mouth’, ‘Pain’, ‘Get Gassed’ and ‘M.E.N’.

Bugzy has performed a number of headline shows across the UK, including performing at the Manchester Ritz and the Wireless Festival in London. He performed at the 2015 Reading and Leeds Festivals, alongside Rae Sremmurd, A$ap Ferg, Azealia Banks, Young Thug and Kendrick Lamar. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bugzy+Malone">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
