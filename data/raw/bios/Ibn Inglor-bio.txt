Jeremiah Abdullah, better known as Ibn Inglor, was born October 26th, 1992 and raised in Altgeld Gardensâ€”a Chicago neighborhood whose violence betrays its peaceful name. Though resources were scarce, Ibn was able to begin making music and building a collective of creative minds. His home inspired him to work harder.

Since 2013, Ibn has released a number of projects that successfully express his vision of the world, including GawdsSpeed, New Wave and New Wave 2. Ibn continues to raise the bar for himself with his distinctive sound and dedication to exploring new ideas. Ibn creates from the depths of his soul, no matter what the circumstances. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ibn+Inglor">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
