Spiral Life was a shibuya-kei duo active from 1993 to 1996 and founded by 車谷浩司 (Air and Laika Came Back) and 石田ショーキチ. The duo was prolific, releasing five albums and seven singles while signed to Polystar Records and two, label assembled, Greatest Hits albums after splitting. 車谷浩司's decision to experiment with electronic music caused the band to split and led to the formation of Air and Laika Came Back. 石田ショーキチ embarked on a solo career, under the name 石田小吉, following the split. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Spiral+Life">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
