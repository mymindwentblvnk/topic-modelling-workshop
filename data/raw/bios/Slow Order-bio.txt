Slow Order ~ Bologna, Italy
Instrumental Stoner Rock
Facebook, Bandcamp

Born in 2009, Slow Order come from Bologna, Italy.  The sound they created is mud and sweat, giving life to mysterious and mystical atmospheres. For fans of doom, southern, heavy, stoner, sludge.  This band was born from the desire to experiment with every kind of emotion and bring it back to music thru use of anger and heaviness. This project represents love for low strings and the pioneers of metal (Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, Cream), merging them with some stoner and modern heavy metal influences. The band have decided to be an instrumental project, rock and groove is the rules.  

Their first album 'Hidden Voices' featuring Patrik Hultin (ex Burst) at the drums was released June 6th, 2014 and is available to stream at Bandcamp.
