A project inspired by black metal, doom, and noise. Is it any of those genres? We don't really think so. It is what it wanted to be when we made it. If its not Kvlt enough or early 90s black metal enough for you then we don't fucking care. We didn't follow another bands design and we will not be clones of the past despite what others want of us. There are no restrictions to this project except that it will never compromise itself for the mass listening audience or the small corner of elitist fucks who will most certainly hate it. Enjoy it or oppose it. Either way we've done what we set out to do.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vardoger+Derelict">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
