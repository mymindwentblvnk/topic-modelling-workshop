The Values, a 4-piece band formed in a little place called Biggin Hill, just outside of Bromley back in November 2005. They started as a group of friends and as they had the same interests in music they decided to form a band. Soon they found that writing and playing songs was a way for them to just relax, they have written many songs, and they vary from a mixture of slow, foot tapping acoustic numbers, to ska skanking tracks, to bursting head rocking classicsâ€¦

The band has individually got different influences, which they bring together to make a fresh tightly knit sound. They have Matt on Guitar, who provides clean, calm riffs to varied ska strumming patterns. Brad on Bass who gives us a mixture of warm layed back and energetic lines. Will providing passionate back tingering vocals and Ben who gives full of life vigorous drum beats. 

Each year they are improving and have worked there way up and are now headlining many gigs. They have released two cds since forming, "The Values: The Demos" and "The Values: EP Part 1", the EP is avaible though download via Myspace or you can Email us with your address and we'll send you a CD.
