Senyawa is a duo from Yogyakarta, Indonesia consisting of Rully Shabara and Wukir Suryadi.

Shabara is the frontman and vocalist of Zoo, a math-rock/experimental band based in Yogyakarta. In Zooâ€™s latest trilogy album he developed a music direction with a traditional music approach by using Javanese language and traditional instruments but still in the vein of punk music. 

Meanwhile, Suryadi devoted his life to traditional music even while in his teens he was also listening to rock and heavy metal (very popular in Indonesia back in the 1980s). He is best known for creating his own instrument which he named Bambuwukir. This bamboo instrument reminds of the Sasando from Rote, an island part of the East Nusa Tenggara province of the Lesser Sunda Islands. There are a couple of distinct differences though between Sasando music and that of Suryadi. Besides plucking the strings on the circular harp, Suryadi also bows the strings. 

Rully Shabara & Wukir met when the latter played at Yes No Klub gig -a monthly event organized by Yes No Wave Music and Performance Klub in Yogyakarta. Sharing the same interests, they started to rehearse a few times and think forward to record their works. Compared to Zoo, Senyawa has a more traditional music feel. Their self-titled debut album was released in 2009.

Senyawa have collaborated with various artists such as Uchihashi Kazuhisa, Arrington De Dionyso, Melt Banana,  Charles Cohen and Stephen O'Malley.
