Formed in early 2009, Solemn They Await is a one man, apocalyptic funeral doom metal band.
Solemn They Await is influenced by other prominant funeral doom bands such as Tyranny, Evoken, Shape of Despair and Worship.
Solemn They Await use orchestra like synths to create an apocalyptic atmosphere, and employ deep funeral doom growls to evoke a sense of despair and hopelessness. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Solemn+They+Await">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
