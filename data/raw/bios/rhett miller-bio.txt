Rhett Miller (born Stewart Ransom Miller II on September 6, 1970) is the lead singer and songwriter for the alternative-country band the Old 97's. He graduated from St. Mark's School of Texas in Dallas in 1989. 

While still in high school, he recorded his first solo effort, Mythologies, released on the Carpe Diem label, and produced by future 97 Murry Hammond. Miller and Hammond then formed the group Sleepy Heroes, a power-pop trio that released one CD - Under A Radio Sun - and promptly disbanded. 

In the early 1990s, Miller started performing country songs acoustically with Hammond with the moniker Ranchero Brothers - a duo that performs occasionally to this day.

Miller's second solo album The Instigator was released in 2002. In 2006, he released The Believer. Recently he released the self-titled Rhett Miller in 2009.
