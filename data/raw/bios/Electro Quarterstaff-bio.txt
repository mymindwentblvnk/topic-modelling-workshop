Electro Quarterstaff is an instrumental triple-axe shred team from the northern Canadian plains (Winnipeg, Manitoba) fully loaded with brain cancer string manipulations and bacon sizzling concussions of percussion. While never a stranger to expansive dynamics, Electro Quarterstaff explores its own fertile garden of shimmery snakecharming melody, groaning seasick harmony, and freewheeling rhythmic explosions in hopes to entrance the most assertive of listeners into a tangled symphony of sludge and frantic fretboard disembowelment.

Since forming in 2001 and absorbing influences as disparate as Bartok and Gorguts along the way, Electro Quarterstaff remains a progressively-minded entity focused on visceral songcraft and layered, polyphonic instrumentation which highlights a seamless integration of wide-eyed romantic melody within a framework of orchestral complexity and devious song structure. We refuse to adhere to any musical rulebook and actively strive for bulletproof musicianship and hypnotizing fluidity. Mountains of charming riffs await to enchant you. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Electro+Quarterstaff">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
