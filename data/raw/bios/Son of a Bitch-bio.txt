Breaking away from SAXON in 1994, guitarist GRAHAM OLIVER reunited with another SAXON founder member in bassist Steve Dawson to form SON OF A BITCH. The name was actually taken with a purpose as it was the original pre-recording name of SAXON. Additional recruits to the band were former SAXON and MOTÃ–RHEAD drummer Pete Gill and American frontman Ted Bullet, previously with THUNDERHEAD.

A lengthy legal battle ensued whereby both parties laid claim to the name SAXON, but an initial judgement was made in favour of original vocalist Biff Byford. By 1998 SON OF A BITCH toured South America, unfortunately billed by many promoters as SAXON, as the legal battle for the name raged. For these shows the band introduced Haydn Conway, previously with SARACEN as second guitarist.

To further confuse matters SAXON's 'Destiny' era drummer Nigel Durham, also to be found on the tribute circuit with ALCATRAZ, had replaced Pete Gill in SON OF A BITCH but not before being asked to by Byford to replace Glockler in SAXON.

Even as late as early 1999 SAXON were being billed as performing in British clubs but this was in reality SON OF A BITCH. The dates were subsequently cancelled due to illness. Oliver disbanded SON OF A BITCH later that year to form a JIMI HENDRIX tribute band with his son on drums. However, by June the pair had teamed up with members of STORMWATCH and WITCHFYNDE to create the LUTHAR BELTZ BAND for live gigs.
