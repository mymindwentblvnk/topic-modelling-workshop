1) Third Eye is a Danish progressive metal band. They recently released their debut album Recipe for Disaster on Escape Music (ESM-209).
The music is technical yet melodic in a style similar to that of Beyond Twilight, Symphony X, a bit of Judas Priest and a lot of something completely new. 
Third Eye is led by local veteran Michael Bodin and features vocalist Per Johansson from Fate and Ureas.

2) Once known as third EYE, the protagonist of this band, Magnus Sundstr√∂m, churned out industrial anthems in the vein of old school acts like SPK and Test Dept. Harmonious streaks from the Dark Ages subsequently made their way into the compositions, so by the time the change of name was a reality, The Protagonist emerged as a full-fledged contender among bands subscribing to a neo-classical idiom. What
we have is not a political spokesman, but a proclaimer of the beauty in darkness.

3) Third Eye was also a heavy psych band from South Africa. They released the album "Searching" in 1969.

4) Third Eye was a band from Melbourne, Australia, consisting originally of Gus Till and Ollie Olsen, and later Olsen on his own.  The early style was techno pop, including a version of Russell Morris's "The Real Thing" on their eponymous album, then trance on the Psy-Harmonics label (see the album "Ancient Future"), and then later into more electronic ambience and experimental music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Third+Eye">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
