Crenshaw native Narissa, is the middle child and the only girl from a family of 5. At a young age, she developed an interest in music through her uncle’s lens who worked as a songwriter. She learned sound and writing techniques from him that later helped sculpt her into an artist. After graduating high school, Narissa knew that furthering her education was important. She made the decision to enroll in St. John University moving her from California to New York. With college in her rear view and a Bachelors of Arts in Communication under her belt, Narissa moved back to Los Angeles and began to focus on her music career. Narissa had to find a way to make it happen. She was certain she couldn’t work for anyone else, so she began The Lash Trap on Slauson, a lash bar which has become an LA staple for beauty and has a second location in NYC. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Narissa">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
