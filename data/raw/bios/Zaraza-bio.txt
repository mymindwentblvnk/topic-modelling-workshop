Zaraza was a Canadian band that combined industrial and doom/death metal. Zaraza was influenced by bands such as Laibach, Swans, Winter, My Dying Bride, Unholy, Dissecting Table, Cocteau Twins, Wolfgang Press (Bird Wood Cage era) and Polish legends Variété (especially their long lost "Bydgoszcz" debut).

The two members were Grzegorz Haus ov Doom (also known as Brian Damage, leader of Montreal industrial legends Phycus) and newly arrived Polish immigrant Jacek "Doomhammer", who met together while DJ'ing at Montreal's CKUT 90.3 FM alternative radio station. Shortly thereafter, in 1993 Zaraza was born.
