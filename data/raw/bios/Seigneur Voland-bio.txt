Seigneur Voland was concieved by vocalist Xaphan whilst he was in prison serving time for descecration of several churches in France. Finally in 1999 he got released and recruited three other band members, L.F. (Kristallnacht), Rimmon and Rost and the legend was born. The band name Seigneur Voland is a reference to Satan from the middle ages.

All members from this band also played in Kristallnacht. In 2002 all activities of the band members ceased and Seigneur Voland was laid to rest, but for a small reunion tour 2004. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Seigneur+Voland">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
