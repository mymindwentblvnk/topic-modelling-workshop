Frozen Spirit is a progressive-death metal band from all around Turkey. Formed by Koray (guitar) and Melih (Bass), they recorded a Death cover, Crystal Mountain. They soon added Huseyin (guitar) to form the original line-up and did nothing ever since. Due to lack of opportunities, band members can't record anything right now (2008). But it is said that band will be active again to compose their own songs in 2009-2010. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Frozen+Spirit">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
