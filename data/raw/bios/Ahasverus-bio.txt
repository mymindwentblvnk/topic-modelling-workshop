The Ahasverus project is a one man act by Henrik Summanen, born 1973 in Stockholm, Sweden. Educated an archaeologist/linguist, he works in museums and excavations since 1992. He currently works for the Medieval museum in Stockholm.

The Ahasverus project digs deep into the soil of musical heritage, the primal sources for inspiration are classicals from 16th century up til the 19th century. The themes are often mystical with an organic touch and a flowing proceeding of soundscapes.

Ahasverus has released four cds: Ten is the number, Evocation, The destiny of Fabian Kazmierski and Foundation.
