Substance for God was a band from Israel, formed in 1992, that played Doom Death Metal with a gothic feel comparable to very early Paradise Lost and Anathema stuff. They begun to play their music in the Roxanne club, Tel-Aviv with bands like Tears, Orphaned Land & Salem.

The music is great especially with the amazing vocals of Alon Moradi. The vocals are sometimes spoken, bearing a slight similarity to Aaron Stainthorpe from My Dying Bride at times. Some songs contains female vocals performed by Orit and keyboards played by Itzik Levy (Tears, Orphaned Land).

Their only release was the "Assembly Of Flowers" album by Radiation Records in 1995.
On 1996 the band sign with NUCLEAR BLAST records and released "The Swan Song" video for Nuclear Blast compilation called "Beauty in Darkness" vol.1.

Substance for God split in 1996

In the months leading up to June 1st, 2014 there have been numerous rumors spread regarding the band's possible reunion, some 20 years after they split up.
Sure enough, in June 1st, 2014, a photo from the band's 1st rehearsal was posted on the band's guitarist Asi Yakobovitch's Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=719218471453841&set=p.719218471453841&type=1&theater).
