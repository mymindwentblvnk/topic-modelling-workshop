Calling Humboldt County California their home, Dragged by Horses hail from behind the redwood curtain. Humboldt has only two roads in and two roads out, located at least five hours from the nearest urban center. The isolation is exactly what drives Dragged by Horses and gives them the freedom to develop their crafts without outside input.

This three-piece sonic assault (Pablo Midence - vocals and guitar, Jody Goldman - bass, and Chris Jaster - drums) has found Humboldt's out of the way location with its beautiful, quiet scenery, and even its crushing poverty level to be inspirational forces that have helped them evolve beyond a typical stoner-rock band; describing themselves as sounding like a "natural disaster" or a "violence orchestra." Dragged by Horses write heavy, sharp and intelligent tracks.
