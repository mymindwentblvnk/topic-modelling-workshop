We were born in the land of Sunda, but our music is not so thick with the feel of Sunda, sundality is a mixture of words and the Sunda lity, said Sunda in our native people interpret as Sunda and said lity is defined as universal, because the word is a word endings lity sentences foreign (English). We try to work to always be the band that followed the era, not related to language, style or fashion a nuanced sunda, but we try to follow the direction of the music and the changing times, we as a people with a spirit of Sunda. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sundality">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
