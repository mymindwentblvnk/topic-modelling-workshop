Ahura is a group founded by Mohammad Eghbal in 1989.
Ahura plays Sufi music, inspired by poems of Persian poets and mystics, above all by Mewlana Jalal ad-Din Rumi, whose spiritual message for understanding among the nations Ahura tries to convey by means of traditional oriental sound structures as well as by including new sound elements.
Itâ€™s Eghbal's aim to employ music as a universal means of communication in order to unite cultures and people beyond all ethnic contrasts and differences. For him music and sounds are an intuitive way to hint at the unity and essence of all things, but without developing a dogma or doctrine.
