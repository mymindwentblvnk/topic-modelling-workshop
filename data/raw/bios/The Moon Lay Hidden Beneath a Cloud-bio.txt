The Moon Lay Hidden Beneath a Cloud were a musical duo from Austria comprised of Albin Julius and Alzbeth. They worked from 1993 until 1998.

The duo’s music was inspired by myriad aspects of European medievalism, including ritual clerical chants and the daily experience of the peasantry. They combined modern industrial electronics, tape loops and samplers with medieval instruments such as the shawm, hurdy gurdy, and Hexenscheit. Alzbeth was the primary vocalist for the group and often sang traditional songs in numerous archaic languages including Middle High German, Latin and Old French. Julius provided distorted and backup vocals.

When performing live, the band often played in old churches, fortresses, medieval prisons and theatres that provided an appropriate atmosphere for their static, militaristic performances.

Early on, the band provided no official photographs or any more information outside of a Swiss mailing address found inside of the albums. The band rarely appeared live or granted interviews. No songs were ever given official titles. All of the group’s music was released on their own record label named Arthur’s Round Table and distributed by World Serpent Distribution.

With each subsequent release the band presented themes traveling further into European history and becoming more martial, choral and bombastic in approach, culminating in their final album; the largely World War II-inspired The Smell of Blood but Victory (1997).

In 1998, the duo, also a couple, parted ways, and no new material has since been recorded. After their split, both of the duo were considerably more vocal and promotional images were released. Albin continued with his other project, Der Blutharsch. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Moon+Lay+Hidden+Beneath+a+Cloud">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
