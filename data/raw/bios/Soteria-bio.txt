Born in mid 2006 Soteria evangelistic ministry as a group of men from different parts of the country dissatisfied with the passivity of contemporary religious systems and infused with the yearning in their hearts by YHWH, to bring good tidings to those places where moral prejudice and preached the social gospel is not such as brothels, gay bars, bars of metal and destitute, in short, all those people displaced by a religious double standard. Some time later decided to put their musical gifts in the service of YHWH and keep his word with music that has always been passionate, breaking new ground in a mono-cultural society such as the world capital of vallenato. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Soteria">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
