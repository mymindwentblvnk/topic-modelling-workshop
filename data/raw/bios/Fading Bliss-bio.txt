Fading Bliss was born in November 2009 when Olivier (ex-Dewback / guitar) decided to start a new band with Doom/Gothic influences. After talking with some friends, the line up was quickly completed by Florian (Innerfire / keys) and Dahl (Innerfire / growls). Then, by word of mouth and through the Internet, Mel (vocals), Michel (drums), Arnaud (Alibido/ bass) and Nicu (2nd guitar) joined the band. Rehearsals started right after a 1st meeting on November 11th 2009. 

Firstly, the band rehearsed covers from Tiamat, Paradise Lost and Katatonia ... and, as it was already united, the 1sts songs were composed. Those were inspired from 90’s Gothic/Doom bands (Paradise Lost, Tiamat, My Dying Bride, Moonspell, Anathema, Katatonia, Amorphis, Septic Flesh) but also from nowadays ones (Shape of Despair, Swallow the Sun, Sentenced, Draconian, Therein ...). In the beginning of 2010, Nicu left as he didn’t have enough time to get involved in the band. 

At the end of the summer 2010, the band recorded its 1st 4 title EP at the Noise Factory studio with Gerald. This EP was released in February 2nd 2011 and the 1st official photoshoot took place as well.
