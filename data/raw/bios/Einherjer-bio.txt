Einherjer is a Viking metal band and was formed in January 1993 by Frode Glesnes (Guitar) and Gerhard Storesund (Drums). Based in Haugesund, a small town on the west coast of Norway.

Their albums are heavily folk influenced, while others have a more traditional symphonic black metal sound. Their lyrics retell Norse legends, and each of their albums has its own theme. 

In Norse mythology, the einherjar (Old Norse literally "army of one", "those who fight alone"[1][2]) are those who have died in battle and are brought to Valhalla by valkyries. In Valhalla, the einherjar eat their fill of the nightly-resurrecting beast Sæhrímnir, and valkyries bring them mead (which comes from the udder of the goat Heiðrún). The einherjar prepare daily for the events of Ragnarök, when they will advance for an immense battle at the field of Vígríðr. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Einherjer">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
