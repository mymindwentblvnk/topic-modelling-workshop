CAUSE OF DIVORCE was founded by Rollo (drums, ex-Orgasmic Groan, ex-Kadath, ex-Zengaya), Marc (voice, ex-Orgasmic Groan) and Ivo (guitar, ex-File not Found) in early 2001. After a little while Christoph (guitar, ex-Abreast) and Norman (bass, ex-Orgasmic Groan) completed the line up. Our typical non-genre like grindattacks are due to our personally different musical predilections. In 2002 we published our first demo called “GENOZID”, in 2004 “NON SERVIAM” , our second demo followed. Both demos were published on CD-r and tape and in totally “ Do-it-yourself” manner, that was intentional.

We always have tried to grind the stage as frequently as possible and as our leisure time allows. Until now we did the small “Grind your Mind”-Tour with MALIGNANT TUMOUR, the “Metal Underground Madness Tour II” with KING’S-EVIL and SCORNAGE and of course several gigs through whole Germany and some neighbouring countries. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cause+Of+Divorce">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
