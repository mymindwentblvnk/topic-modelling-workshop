Analysis of Bison Kills are the band formerly known as Tear Gas and Plate Glass. Formed in 2001, the core duo of brothers Matthew and Nathan Dick released their debut self titled demo to positive reviews in the underground metal press. Backed by a drum machine, the two piece carved out oppressive slabs of sludge doom in the vein of British greats such as Electric Wizard, Iron Monkey and Godflesh.

Driven to progress their sound and branch out beyond the conventional doom/sludge template, Analysis of Bison Kills recruited Dutch drummer Andries v.d. Boom. With this new line up intact AOBK recorded their second demo “The Sea Stranded Whipjack” delivering everything from cerebral busy riffing to slow motion doom dirges tinged with electronic experimentation. This second release met with glowing reviews.

AOBK were soon signed to Sound Devastation Records and work began on ‘Vantage’, a four song 30 minute mini album. Again, the band’s line up expanded, adding Scott Tyrell on bass guitar. 

On ‘Vantage’ AOBK continue to set themselves apart from their peers, straying far enough from current trends to deliver fresh sounding multifaceted heavy music. This unique act have continued to grow far beyond their doom/sludge roots into something truly special.

Vantage will be released in March 2008 by Sound Devastation Records
