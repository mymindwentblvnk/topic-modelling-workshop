Has released numerous EPs both on MDR and Ostgut Ton. Also a prolific remixer with reworks of artists such as Oleg Poliakov, Function, Abstract Division, Kondens, Marcel Fengler, Marcel Dettmann and ZZT. Will release the next mix cd of the prolific Berghain series, 06. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Norman+Nodge">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
