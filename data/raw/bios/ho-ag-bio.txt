Ho-Ag was an experimental "noise rock" band based in Boston, Mass. Known for melding the creaky musical worlds of 50s and 60s sci-fi films, Waitsian dissonant underworld, and fast-paced math-punk, Ho-Ag has adapted through several line-up changes, guest collaborations, experimental one-off shows, and infrequent Devo cover sets to evolve into a consistently unpredictable band that has earned them comparisons to acts like Six Finger Satellite, The Dismemberment Plan, Brainiac and Melvins.

Begun in 2001 by Matt Parish, Dave Dines, Patrick Kim and Jonathan Ruhe (The Gersch, Cokedealer), the four-piece released their first official album on the notorious Jamaica Plain noise-rock label Mister Records after becoming fast friends with artists in that scene, including Neptune and Donna Parker. After several lineup changes, they released The Word from Pluto on Athens label Hello Sir Records in 2006. Along the way, they had picked up vocalist and keyboardist Tyler Hollis Derryberry (formerly of Rancid Yak Butter Tea Party and high school bandmate of Parish), drummer Eric Meyer (of Hallejujah the Hills), and bassist Nicholas ("Nkls") Ward, and self-released an EP, Pray for the Worms.  Since the release of Pluto, the band has added new bassist Ryan Brown and new guitarist Kristina Johnson (of Roh Delikat and Certainly, Sir). The band embarks on frequent US tours.

Parish and Derryberry still frequently collaborate with Kim in sideprojects such as Colorvision 3D, Zoig-Ma-Noig, Our Black President, and Walt Meadornack and His All-Stars.
