Well, Beast Warrior actually has a mythology about them in the same vein as GWAR, but the good folks at Last.fm don't really like that, it seems. Not big fans of fun, those ones.

Anyway, without violating any of the identities of the beings known as Beast Warrior, here is some info:

They're mostly centered in Chicago, although they have outlets on the West Coast and in Cleveland.

Influences: Maiden, 3 Inches of Blood, The Megaman video game series.

Sounds like: 3 Inches of Blood combined with a Fantasy/Gay romance novel. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Beast+Warrior">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
