Madder Rose is a New York City-based alternative pop band who recorded in the 1990s. The band is fronted by Mary Lorson, who shares songwriting duties with guitarist Billy Cot√©. Several of their songs, including "Panic On" and "Car Song", were featured in John Peel's end of year roundup the Festive Fifty. The band released three albums on Atlantic Records and one on independent label Thirsty Ear before breaking up in 1999. Their music has been described as suggesting the druggy languor of a heroin high, which inspired the British music press to trumpet Madder Rose as the second coming of the Velvet Underground. Their sound progressed from indie pop rock, not unlike peers Velocity Girl and Juliana Hatfield, to Shoegaze and Trip-Hop. After the breakup, Lorson founded the Alt Folk outfit Saint Low. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Madder+Rose">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
