Black Mood are two German metalheads, X is on guitars and powerful vocals, and Izz is on pummeling drums.
They released a demo and they are guests on two great compilations, Doom Metal Alliance vol 11 and Deutschland’s Doom I.
Only two metalheads?
Don’t worry, they are able to produce a big amount of hyper groovy sludgy noise in sincere worship to Phil Anselmo & Friends.
The guys gave their own definition of their music: “Our Sound is a mixture from fucking sludge-metal-style to dooming riffs and the surely breeze of the New Orleans Sound.
Our influences are bands from the south of America, for example the kings of PANTERA (R.I.P. Dime), the Heavyweight of CROWBAR, the psychos from EYEHATEGOD and SUPERJOINT RITUAL, C.O.C. and of course DOWN”. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Black+Mood">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
