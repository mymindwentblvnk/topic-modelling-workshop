grindcore band of Santos city, Brazil, formed in March of 1994. HIERARCHICAL PUNISHMENT have the purpose of doing grindcore fast and threatening, with influences also of death metal. Its lyrics direct attack the social injustices, war, poverty and the society problems. Alexandre and Grell made part of the last formation of EXPLICIT REPULSION and joined themselves to Leo Gazzano, who came from BONES EROSION (a group that hurled a split-EP 7" with HINFAMY through ELEPHANT RECS., of Santos city) and who had already played at EXPLICIT REPULSION too, to form the HIERARCHICAL PUNISHMENT.
