Karpatenhund (Carpathian Dog) is a rock-band formed in 2004 in Cologne, Germany. The name comes from the title of the first part of Die drei ???, a detective book series.

Vocalist Claire Oelkers met guitarist Björn Sonnenberg in Köln 2003. They created a band before founding the rest of the band, consisting of bass and synth player Stefanie Schrank, second guitarist Jan Niklas Jansen and drummer Maurizio Arca (who was replaced by Saskia von Klitzing in 2008). After playing a lot of concerts they decided to sign with Virgin Records in 2006. The band split up in 2013.
