King Bong was born in the year of VIII, the breed of one night of wild intercourse between the Universal Evil and the very principle of Life. An epic juggernaut, a wooly beast roaring with fierceness and longing for the peace of his adulterated mind. The only way to achieve some rest is to consume the Sacred Weed, raised with love by humans and bestowed in front of the fidgety beast by three distorted minds. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/King+Bong">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
