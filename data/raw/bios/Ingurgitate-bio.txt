Ingurgitate is a darkened death metal band hailing from Houston, Texas. With a pedigree of pure TXDM old schoolers comprising such former bands as Infernal Dominion, Braced for Nails, Devourment, Sect of Execration and even grind maniacs Insect Warfare. Hell bent on combining the old school aesthetics of speed and intensity with brutality and memorable song writing, Ingurgitate are intent on bringing back the heyday of death metal when bands were honest and played from the gut. See you on the road.

     With a range of participants extracted from a plethora of past and current Texas bands, Ingurgitate are the zenith of old school death metal ethos cloaked in the ruthlessness of TXDM slam.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ingurgitate">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
