Sounds Of Fury is a death metal band from Switzerland. 

Sounds Of Fury's first rehearsal took place on mid-july 2011. Six songs were already wirtten and the aim was to release a DEATH METAL record. The album was recorded during Fall 2011 at the Audiorec Studio in Yverdon-Les-Bains (CH) and mixed/mastered at Hertz Studio in Poland (VADER, BEHEMOTH, DECAPITATED). You have in your hands the final result of this work. We are currently looking for partners to promote our album and are willing t play live. All musicians have great stage experience and we would indeed consider any proposal.
