1) Ex Machina was born from the ashes of Chrysaor for a new a exciting beginning, Ex Machina literally mean 'From the machine' and that's perfect the new style chosen this time round and so far I've made so much progress that it was no longer Chrysaor anymore, i am exploring and fusing different styles of genres available to me but the main and important ingredient is Industrial, there will be lots of that involved but who knows where i might progress in the future. The equipment I'm using for recording are my trusty Ibanez guitar which has given me the sound that i was looking for and is also very versatile for melodic play, i used a Fender bass as they provide excellent bass sound, electronic drums and a keyboard which are a Yamaha and it's all recorded using Cubase 5 which i found extremely difficult to use at first but revealed itself to me. I need to point out that all of this is being done in the name of fun, in no way is this serious with any plans to get signed or anything to do with making money or business related, i love just doing this knowing that its not gonna go anywhere and i'm under no pressure in any way from anyone regarding what i do here, fun is fun and i like it A LOT :D. My inspiration musically revolves around guitar based bands like Fear Factory, Sevendust, Linkin Park, Disturbed, Adema to Devin Townsend himself, there will be nothing new to what I'm doing with Ex Machina, just paying an homage to a great, forgotten and loathed genre... here's to you!
