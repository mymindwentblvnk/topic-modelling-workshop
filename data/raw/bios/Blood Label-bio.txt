Blood Label is a young Danish thrash- and death metal band originating from the centre of Jutland, Denmark. The band has played numerous shows in and out of Denmark since its formation in late 2008, supporting such esteemed Danish metal acts as Hatesphere, The Kandidate, Mercenary, The Psyke Project, As We Fight, The Burning, etc.

Bonecrushing grooves, ten ton breakdowns and machine gun blastbeats are some of the characteristics of Blood Label. Relying heavily upon catchy vocal hooklines, crunchy riffs and pounding drums, Blood Label has created a unique hybrid of death and thrash, and fused inspirations from bands such as Hatesphere, Lamb of God and Gojira into one single entity packed with speed, groove and melody.

August 2011 marks the release of Blood Label's debut record- a mini-album entitled "Existence Expires", recorded at Antfarm- and Jacob Bredahl's Dead Rat Studio. This 9-tracked beast will undoubtedly take Blood Label even further…… <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Blood+Label">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
