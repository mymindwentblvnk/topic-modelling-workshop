Violetta Villazz was founded in the year 2005 when members of polish bands like: Reincarnation, Barricades, Cf98, Scumbag, Middle finger, Corozone, Daily Bread gathered together. Musicians described them style as Bonarka Deathcore, which is great hydride of trash straight from Bay Area and furious deathmetal from hell. Lyrics stink with the most dark secrets of humans soul. Listening to this stuff you shall discover the world fulfilled with cruelty, pain toxic love and a dirt of reality. Those who seek for the music dripping with the blood and sweat surely soon will get into addiction There is no way back when Ogrish Deadi inspired by the devil wheezes and screams insane stories Violletta Villazz smashes their public during the shows, torturing them with furious riffs and pure stage energy. Eventually, after several line-up changes, in 2006 the band recorded their first Lp entitled Violletta Villazz in polish Diamond Studio. Album includes 8 original tracks. During those 2 years Violletta Villazz played many shows in whole country supporting bands as 25ta Life. At present with over 1hour length set they are looking forward to conquer the foreign stage. Currently the band is working on 1st video clip to the promo song Bonarka Monster and they have just finished the design of lps cover layout. Will you dare to try
