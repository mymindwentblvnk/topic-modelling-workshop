Kooley High is the product of five friends meeting on the bricks of NC State University with a passion for hip-hop. What started out as a student-run Hip Hop Organization (H2O), founded by members of the group, soon turned into an interest to make fresh music with each other. With the three emcees, Charlie Smarts, Rapsody, and Tab-One, and two producers, Foolery and The Sinopsis, this group plans to further establish the "North Carolina sound". Hip-hop isn't new to these guys, both Charlie Smarts and Tab-One are also in the live, roots driven hip-hop band Inflowential, and Rapsody (you might have heard her on the interludes of 9th Wonder's - The Dream Merchant Vol. 2) is a part of 9th Wonder's "It's A Wonderful World" record label. With the guidance of Justus League founders 9th Wonder and Cesar Comanche, Kooley High plans to turn NC into the new m.e.c.c.a. for hip-hop.
