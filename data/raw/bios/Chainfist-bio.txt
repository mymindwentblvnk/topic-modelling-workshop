Press release   CHAINFIST

Those who do, as yet, not know Chainfist, will, however, surely know names, such as Michael Kopietz (Frozen Sun, Panzerchrist) and Braca Pedersen (Infernal Death). 

However, do not expect Chainfist to be an amplification of what these guys have been and done in the past. 
New times, new sounds, ”Metal Rock!” Michael Kopietz calls it with conviction.

Songs like ”Clown”, ”Free me” or ”Black out” from  the forthcomming album ”Black out Sunday”, confirms to the full, what is happening to metal nowadays; the crunch and the speed are still there, but the raw power that exuberates along with the attitude towards the song and the lyrics is real,  rather than just turning up the volume of their poweramps.

Chainfist, which was formed in 2007, has now become a household name on the island of Sjælland and in the entire danish ”underground”.

With an album on the way, and now with C.B.B.M. backing the guys up, you will have your work cut out to try to stop this band, moving onwards and upwards!

About the Album:

“Black Out Sunday” contains 12 songs recorded at Six String Studios, with Søren Jensen as producer, known for his work with Danish acts, such as Corpus Mortale, Iron Fire, Vira. 

Mixed and mastered by producer Ziggy at ZigZound, known for his work with acts like Illdisposed, Hatesphere, Raunchy, Mercenary, Scamp.

The new logo is designed by artist Fivours Moreleon known for his artwork with Danish acts Aqua, Pretty Maids, Hampenberg, etc. And complete artwork by the photographer Søren Sielemann.
