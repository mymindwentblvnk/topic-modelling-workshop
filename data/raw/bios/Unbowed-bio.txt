Unbowed began in March of 2011 as a studio project involving Ioan Tetlow (Vocals) and Alex Snape (Guitar/Backing Vocals). 

Since then the band has assembled a full line-up, independently recorded and released a 5 song EP, played shows throughout the province of Ontario (including opening for major international acts such as Battlecross, Einherjer, The Contortionist, Erimha, and Intervals).

Unbowed are now set to release their first full-length album in Spring/Summer of 2014. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Unbowed">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
