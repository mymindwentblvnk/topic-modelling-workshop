Besides being a famous aeroplane model Fokker is also a
band from Helsinki, Finland!

Musically Fokker is circling somewhere above the edged
terrain of rough rock. Fueled by a mix of bass, baritone and
regular guitars and shaken by the constant turbulence of angry
drummin' this plane is really flying low!

Outsiders have compared Fokker to anything from Danzig to
Chris Isaak and at times it's not that far from QOTSA either.
So, as you might have already guessed, the musical content
of Fokker is not restricted to just one or two chords.

But don't you go on believin' everything you're told, find out
yourself!
