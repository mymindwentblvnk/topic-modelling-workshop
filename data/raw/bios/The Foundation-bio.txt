According to Wikipedia there are several bands named The Foundation.

1) A Houston, Texas based rap group signed to Rawkus Records. http://www.thefoundationmusic.com

2) An alias for the rap group The Roots

3) A mid-80's Swedish progressive rock band very much in the vein of early Camel: keyboard oriented, melodious symphonic prog with sparse, laid back vocals. What sets them apart is their use of Chapman stick and the cello that gives their sound a rich, warm glow. Curiously for a band of the 80's, they never used any sequencers or computers. As for influences, they claim to have been inspired by Klaus Schulze, Mike Oldfield, Vangelis, Igor Stravinsky, Genesis and Emerson, Lake & Palmer among others. Each musician had a very different approach to making an album: the drummer wanted lively hit songs, the synth player thought any track under 10 minutes was crap, the bass player wanted to play Rhythm'n Blues and the guitar/vocalist only listened to Steve Morse. They compromised and stuck together for the space of one album, released in 1985; they did a few gigs in Sweden and Germany and then split up.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Foundation">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
