Paolo Cipolla (Synth/Vox)


2.) Woodwall is an instrumental duo. They write and record their own pieces using a collaborative process. The multi-instrument pieces flow in and out of melody and disjointed calamity. Woodwall takes advantage of multiple tones to create a layered sound that then suddenly becomes incredibly sparse in a few of the tracks. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Woodwall">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
