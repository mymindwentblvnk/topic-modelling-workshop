Since 1997 FALLEN YGGDRASIL are working on their musical vision unimpressed of trends. The band from Tübingen / Germany mixes brutal Death Metal with melodic elements and parts that are more or less unusual in this genre. The present result of their work is the Promo-CD "Prospect of Prey" which is out since april 2006.

BIOGRAPHY:

* In 1997 FALLEN YGGDRASIL came to life

* In 1998 FALLEN YGGDRASIL entered the scene with their first official demo "Odyssey in Sorrow". "Odyssey..." recieved very good reviews and sold in a four-digit edition. Back then the band was already awarded "intensity" and "originality" and it was called "one of the most promising acts". Following this, FALLEN YGGDRASIL played a lot of concerts at home and abroad also with more known bands such as Night In Gales, Centinex, Goddess Of Desire, Fleshcrawl and many more.

* In the beginning of the year 2000 this success was continued through the release of a 7" (limited to 500 copies, sold-out) until the trend was being held back by line-up changes.

* In 2001 a "completely renewed" band played around 30 concerts in Germany and abroad. Prepared like this the Maranis-Studios were entered in October where "In no sense Innocence" was recorded under the guidance of Vagelis Maranis (ex-Sanvoisen).

* In 2002 "In no sense Innocence" was released as a self-financed record and it recieved very good reviews (see press). The band also kept up the live activities of the years gone-by and couldn`t even be held up by some new line-up changes in the spring of 2002. End of 2002 FALLEN YGGDRASIL joined forces with the German label SUPREME CHAOS RECORDS, which offered to re-release "In no sense Innocence" under their flag.

* In february 2003 after the self released version of "In nos sense Innocence" was sold out, it was officially re-released via Supreme Chaos Records. Many concerts were being playerd throughout the year.

* The year 2004 saw the release of the new Fallen Yggdrasil CD "Building up a Ruin to Come", which was again released via Supreme Chaos Records. The CD was accepted very well throughout the scene (see press on this homepage), just like its predecessor. With "Building up a Ruin to Come" Fallen Yggdrasil took another step forward. A part of that were also the live activities of the band (together with bands like Benediction and Dismember). The end of 2004 saw a little drawback for the band, when Denno hat to take is hat and left the band as a fourpiece.

* The first half of 2005 was filled with many gigs (16 till june) and the search for a new guitar player. But after the band had found that fifth man, it was permanently stopped by concerts that were cancelled shortly before taking place. It is therefore even more surprising, that at the end of the year we nearly played thirty gigs (together with bands like Sodom, Pro Pain Dismember, Holy Moses, God Dethroned, My Darkest Hate and Goddess Of Desire). The activity of our second guitar player didn`t last very long ofr he was kicked out of the band in december 2005. We didn`t part with bad feelings towards each other but the "old" Fallen Yggdrasil members decided to go on as a fourpiece which had proven to be the only acceptable way. The lineup since december 2005 is therefore Simon (vocals), Raffael (guitar), Christoph (drums) and Tobias (bass).

* In january 2006 the band entered the Maranis studios in Backnang to record the "Prospect of Prey" Promo. With this Promo the band is hoping to find a new label because the deal with Supreme Chaos Records ran out. Fallen Yggdrasil is still and more then ever a motivated and professional band that spends all its energy in getting forward. Numerous gigs have already been organized, like the Ragnarök Festival or the Eisenwahn Open Air. A new full-length Cd will be out end of 2006 / beginning of 2007.
Simon left the band 2006, the new singer will be presented on tour in autumn.
