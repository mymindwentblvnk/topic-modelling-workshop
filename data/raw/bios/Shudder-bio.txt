Shudder was formed in 1997 in Kansas City, Missouri. They have self-produced two full-length albums (Shudder[2004], Something[2006]) spanning three discs and comprising over 40 songs. In 2008 they debuted the new, flash-based www.shuddermusic.com, featuring the radically unique, serialized release of their third album (Generation Why[2008].) They have played such legendary and historic venues as the Whisky A Go-Go, The Voodoo Lounge, The Uptown Theater, Crosstown Station, and the Kansas City Spirit Festival. They have been featured on 96.5 The Buzz, PopFreeRadio.com, "The Big Dumb Fun Show", "Riff Revolution," "The KCJukebox.com Show," and 105.9 The Lazer. They hold four featured "Songs of the Day" and several positions on the all-time charts on Garageband.com, including "Another Buena Vista Sunset," which has perpetually held the Number 1 Best Lyrics of All-Time in Alternative Pop for three years running. In 2003, they won The Setlist’s first ever Battle of the Bands against none other than the 2008 American Idol David Cook’s band, Axium. In 2007, Shudder became the first-ever "Mixed Wars" champion in "Mid-America’s Ultimate Battle Of The Bands," Club Wars. They have proudly performed alongside Tech N9ne, Mac Lethal, The Capsules, Doris Henson, Ultimate Fakebook, Reach, Hey Mercedes, Angeles Drake, The Minus Story, Cloud Cult and Heidi Phillips (of Frogpond), among hundreds of others.
