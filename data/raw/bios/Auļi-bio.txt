Bagpipe and drum music group Auļi was founded in 2003. A few of group members have already played in the first bagpipe group in Latvia – Dūdinieki, which was formed in 1994. Regardless of the fact that there is scare trace left of bagpipe and drum playing traditions, both instruments were mentioned in Latvian folklore materials.
