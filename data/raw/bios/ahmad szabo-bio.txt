Ahmad Szabo is Guillermo Scott Herren's Experimental jazz side-project. Name supposedly taken from jazz pianist Ahmad Jamal, and Hungarian jazz guitarist Gabor Szabo.

Herren releases music under various aliases, most notably Prefuse 73, Delarosa and Asora and Piano Overlord and Ahmad Szabo. He also performs with Eva Puyuelo Muns as the group Savath and Savalas. 

He began his career DJing at MJQ, a small night club in Atlanta, and then began working in commercial studios but soon branched out into his own music. Herren's first major release was under the Delarosa and Asora moniker in 1997 with Sleep Method Suite, with his latest work currently being the Prefuse 73 full-length album, Preparations[which included a bonus disc of purely orchestral ambience dubbed "Interregnums." This disc being Herren's first time ever composing for a full orchestra.] <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ahmad+Szabo">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
