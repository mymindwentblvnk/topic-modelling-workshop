Dead Mountain Mouth plays Death metal with Psychedelic and Progressive influences. 

Their music expresses " Contrasts between oppression and disembodiment , alienation and agoraphobia, ego-centrism and omniscience, mankind and machine, [like] the cement of a new dialectic. Its shape is a complex architecture made of violence, clarity, anger, hypnosis, pain, psychedelia and dehumanization."

They come from  France (Midi-Pyrénées) and have released a self-produced album entitled Unveil in 2008 which the band lets you download here for free (check out their Myspace if the link is removed)
