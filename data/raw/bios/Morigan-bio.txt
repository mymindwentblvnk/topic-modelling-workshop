There are several bands with that name on Last.fm:

1.) MORIGAN - Tartu, Estonia. Re-formed in 2003. Band orignally dates back to 1998.

MORIGAN’s music is about life itself. Lyrics are inspired by emotions and experiences of the band members themselves. Every song spiced with enough cynical and sarcastic elements inteprets the world we live in.
