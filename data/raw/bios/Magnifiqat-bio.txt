Magnifiqat is a symphonic metal band from Milan, Lombardy, Italy, founded by Emanuele Rastelli (also founder of Crown of Autumn). They released their first and so far only album "Il pi√π antico dei giorni" in 2004.
The evocative sound of Magnifiqat is influenced by classical music, ethnic music, gothic rock and cantautori. Their poetic lyrics, completely in Italian, take inspiration from Christian themes. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Magnifiqat">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
