World Battering is the new Death Metal project of the guitarist and drummer of the Swedish band, Prosperity. Due to the impossibility of continuing working together, Johnny Jonsson (Guitar) and John Aho (Drums) start a new band, World Battering. They immediately started writing new songs and after a few months they found a vocalist, Anders Ã–sterberg. Not long after, bassist Mikael Johansson joined them. The band is currently rehearsing and focused on the new material, but soon they will start playing live. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/World+Battering">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
