Biomorph is a Latvian progressive metal organism from RÄ«ga, Latvia that has formed its current lineup in the winter of 2012.

Each of the five band members has previously gained own unique and different experience in various metal projects inside and outside of Latvia before Biomorph band was fully established. But what unites the Biomorph is a thirst for heavy, groovy, musical and complex metal cocktail and all these flavors can be found and heard in original musical compositions of the Biomorph.

In February 2013 Biomorph has released two self-recorded and mixed demo tracks titled Myogenic Fiction and Dreary Convolution. Currently the band is focusing on debut album to be released in autumn of 2013 meanwhile playing some local gigs as well.
