Electronic musician Mark Nicholas is best-known for his work as a Synth-Pop artist under the name Cosmicity. From 2007-2008, however, Mark worked under his given name for the release of two much grittier electronic albums: Duchess 33 and Perversions.

All other releases by Mark have been under the name Cosmicity - all 13 of them.  His first published album dates back to 1994, and a new full-length Cosmicity album is expected at the end of 2011.
