A smashing collage of powerful vocals, heavy riffs and pounding rhythms, Drillpoint is at the forefront of the modern metal movement, combining elements of Hardcore, Thrash, as well as various other genres of Metal.

Attacking songs at a furious pace since 2000, every member contributes to create the fury that is Drillpoint. Since the release of the first six song promo disc, recorded in 2003, Drillpoint has secured coveted opening slots for the likes of DamagePlan, Hatebreed, Sworn Enemy, Protest the Hero, Exodus, 3 Inches Of Blood, and Anvil, while playing sold out headlining shows touring throughout Ontario and Quebec, continuously recording and releasing new material.

Drillpoint is a potent assault on the senses. One listen and you will find out how much Drillpoint can make you move!
