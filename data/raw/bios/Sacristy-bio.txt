2009 BIOGRAPHY AND DISCOGRAPHY
Sacristy's reign as the Tyrannical Black Metal Judas Goats commenced under the seventh moon of anno 1999, with the sole intention of keeping the tradition of true, occult, misanthropic, satanik black metal.
The first formation of Sacristy consisted of Natazrahn (Vocals, Guitar, Keyboards), Selioz (Baphomet War Blasts) and Selpiner (Guitar). In the late part of 2001, Sacristy added comrade and bass player Shaftplague to the regiment, tracked soon after by Nihil ..keyboards. In the following year, the coven's live Luciferian rituals were well received by audiences. Signed and well known acts Sacristy has shared the ..stage with include, 
Destroyer 666, Blood Storm, Nun Slaughter, Deicide, Dee Snider, Dying Fetus, Summon, Abazagorath, Inquisition and many others.
In February 2003, the horde recorded their first full-length album "The Plague of Solitude." Around the same time, the original members of Sacristy were torn apart by ..personal problems, musical differences as well as the ..relocation of Selpiner and Selioz. At this point Natazrahn had enough material for a second ..release but no band to achieve his vision, and did depress into misanthropy, alcoholism and an anti-social, reclusive, hermitic way of life for over a year.
In 2004 Sacristy was resurrected with the recruitment of long time Satanik ally and former session keyboard player Niddhogg (bass) and fellow krist krusher, Eschaton (drums). These three heretics began to necromanse the hymns which Natazrahn had created and made only three (3) live appearances in 2004, including the infamous "Goat Crucifixion" at a small venue in New Jersey, September 24, 2004. Soon after Sacristy's second full-length entitled "Primordial Serpent Holocaust" was released.
August of 2007, Sacristy finished recording and released the third and most accomplished album MASTERS OF BAPHOMETIC DEVASTATION.  It has sold a record number of 13 units as of December 31 , 2008.   
After a lengthy silence during most of 2008, The Masters of Baphometic Devastation have started 2009 with pre-production and writing of new material.  By Summer of 2009, Natazrahn hopes to release the fourth full length Sacristy opus, tentatively entitled 4444.  After playing only 2 live rituals in 2008, Sacristy plans to do more shows both locally, as well as mini-tours or shows around the country and the world in the upcoming year or so to promote the 10th year anniversary of this project.
