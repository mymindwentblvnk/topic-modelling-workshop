Little Sparta are a London based band started by Alan Boyd around 2000.

The first release, 'Dead to the World', was a CDR made during a period of convalescence and limited to 100 copies. All included hand made prints.

Early on Little Sparta started to work with Scottish poet Gerry Mitchell eventually signing a 3 record deal with Fire Records. The Result has so far been  'Scalpel Slice'(2005) & 'The Ragged Garden'(2008). Two single of 'Feasting on my Heart' have also been released. All the releases on Fire records have received excellent reviews and challenged the notion of spoken word with music as a genre.

In 2007 Little Sparta recorded two songs with Sally Timms of the Mekons which has been released by Grey Gallery Records as its first artist.

Little Sparta are recording new tracks for an instrumental LP as well as creating a work using shadow puppetry entitled 'The Resurrection Men' which should be ready for spring 2009.
