This band drinks alot.  Have been around the jersey scene for a while now.  Playing Black Thrash with solos and some melodies here and there.  Basically just awesome heavy metal.  They are very active and have more than 100 shows in their past.  Having just obtained a new guitarist they are back in business and will be around your town to tear the stage up.  Also they have completed a full US tour in the summer of 09 to cali and back.  Look up ALcoholic Darkness which is their first demo and Against the Cosmos their first full length.  Their music is on ww.myspace.com/anticosm.  Currently they are working on releasing more new material and booking shows regularly so keep up with them if you like real fuckn metal! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Anticosm">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
