In the year 2001 Bob (drums) and Mike (guitar) start jamming together at the haunted attic of an old building in the town of Ede (the Netherlands). Two years later, Gerdo (guitar) and Rob (bass) join them, and as Mike takes up vocals, Netherstorm is complete. The first mini-cd 'Grand Heretic Paradise', which has a doomy atmosphere, is recorded in 2005. 

  After some gigs and some more band changes, Bob and Mike find Asher and Michiel ready to pick up their axes and make determination the key-word for Netherstorm again. Meanwhile our style has changed from doomy to a faster, heavier one, which we think will surprise people in a good way. 

  In August 2008, Netherstorm started recording the new PROMO 'Chaos from the Sky' which consists of four tracks. In spring 2009, the four-track promo Chaos From The Sky was released through Netherstorm.nl. Anyone wanting a hardcopy promo can get it at one of Netherstorm's gigs.
