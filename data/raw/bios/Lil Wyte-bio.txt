Patrick Lanshaw, or Lil Wyte, is a member of the Memphis, Tennessee rap collective Hypnotize Camp Posse. Lil Wyte began his career with the all-white underground rap group Shelby Forest Clique. His first album Doubt Me Now, produced by DJ Paul & Juicy J of Three 6 Mafia, sold over 130,000 copies independently. The success from this album sparked interest with Warner Music Group which would result in a distribution deal for the Hypnotize Minds label and his second album, Phinally Phamous.

His first album had an underground hit, especially popular with the drug sub-culture, for the song about abusing prescription pills, "Oxy Cotton". So far, both of his albums have carried on a rap tradition of having a Smokin' Song (a song detailing smoking marijuana) included on them. His first release actually had a song titled "My Smokin' Song" on it. He expanded on this theme with his second album having a song named "My Drinking Song".
