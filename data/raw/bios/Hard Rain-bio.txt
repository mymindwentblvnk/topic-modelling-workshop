Hard Rain was a spin-off project formed by former Magnum band members, namely vocalist Bob Catley and guitarist Tony Clarkin. 

Despite producing an excellent, melodic, catchy and very Magnum-like self-titled album the band was relatively short-lived with Clarkin announcing it's demise around 1999. The album "Hard Rain" (1997), follows the previous Magnum formula with Catley's superb vocals, Clarkin's guitars and use of backing keyboards in the older "prog rock" tradition; as well as a slightly funkier beat and harmonic backing vocals (Sue McCloskey). A second, more experimental album, "When the Good Times Come" followed in 1999. 

Often overlooked but if you are a long-standing fan of Magnum then you're very likely to want the album "Hard Rain" in your collection as it rivals the best that the former band had to offer. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hard+Rain">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
