Blah Records formed in 2006 primarily to release the debut rap supergroup Children of The Damned album 'Tourettes Camp'. It has since developed into a fully fledged international rap cult.

This new project showcases a revamped roster and fresh bars from original members Lee Scott, Sly Moon, Salar, Bill Shakes, Tony Broke & King Grubb alongside rhymes spat by modern Blah recruits Bisk, Black Josh, Stinkin Slumrok and Sleazy F Baby. Together they take form as the Cult Of The Damned, filling in for the shortage of lyrical supergroups in UK hip-hop. Producer Reklews expectedly features to deliver with his refined signature cold-sagginâ€™ sound, along with Col. Mustard & Morriarchi who also back the showcase. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cult+of+the+Damned">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
