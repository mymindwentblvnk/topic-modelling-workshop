Protector formed in 1986 and they formed in Wolfsburg, Germany.  They moved to Stockholm, Sweden later.  Their lyrics deal with death, war, politics and anti-fascism.  They are a thrash metal / death metal band.  In the late 1980â€™s they released Golem and  Urm the Mad.  Then they released A Shedding of Skin in 1991 and The Heritage in 1993.  Marco Pape was keeping the band alive as best as possible after those last couple of albums were recorded.  No other albums were recorded later on.  They disbanded in 2003, not the 1990's like some sources claim.

The band reformed in 2011.  Their 2nd most recent album is Reanimated Homunculus and it was released in the year 2013.  It was recorded a couple of years after the band reformed and it was their first album in 20 years.  In the year 2019, they recorded an even newer album called Summon the Hordes.
