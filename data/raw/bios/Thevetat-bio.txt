NY classic death metal band make their first offering. Deep in the mind since 2004, it wasn't until 2011 the beast that is Thevetat took its proper shape. Total filthy death metal is spewed forth in this three song effort. Crushing riffs, gutteral vocals, and relentless blasting open the gates of hell. Featuring members of Ceremonium, Hemlock and Cerebral Haemorrage. Thevetat bring unholy power to the abyssic domain of corruption with an emphasis on strong songwriting and occult themes. Disease to Divide is a cooperation between Dark Descent Records and Destro Records. Death metal that speaks for the dead!
