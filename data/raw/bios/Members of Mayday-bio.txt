Members of Mayday is a music project by Klaus Jankuhn and Maximilian Lenz. The latter is better known as Westbam. Every year since 1991 the Members of Mayday create the official hymn of the annual Mayday Rave that takes place from April 30 to May 1 at Westfalenhallen in Dortmund. It's Germany's largest indoor rave.
