Listen to the new EP "Warrior" by Anilah here: http://anilah.bandcamp.com

Anilah is the solo project from vocalist, composer, and sound shaman Dréa Drury. Born in the Kootenay Mountains of Western Canada, Dréa was immersed in nature from a very early age and developed a way of listening that enabled her to compose music based on interactions with the natural environment. She has studied North Indian Classical music with Ali Akbar Khan, Silvia Nakkach, and Shweta Jhaveri, as well as explored the healing potential of music with sound shamans across North America. She now composes music in a ritual and ceremonial setting, always honouring nature as the primary source point of inspiration. 

Dréa is now working on a full length album to be released this year.
