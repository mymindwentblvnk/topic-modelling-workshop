Advent Sorrow is a six piece Black Metal band, the bands sound is a mix or black metal, symphonic black metal, doom with a touch of dsbm. Advent labels themselves as “Torturous Black Metal” which is supported by the howling screams of agony and depression by vocalist Rhys Kings. The bands first release in 2012 “Before the Dimming Light - EP” was an instant success and achieved international acclaim which lead to touring opportunities with Marduk, Taake and Watain.
After a small line up changes in 2015, Advent released their follow up album “As All Light Leaves Her”. This release saw the band focus on a darker sound and unique vocals which lead to the album and merchandise selling out in weeks of release.
