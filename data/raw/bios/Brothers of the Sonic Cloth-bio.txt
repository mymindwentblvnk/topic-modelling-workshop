Death is an imminent force: it is an expression of the rhythm of nature having no purpose beyond its own perpetual regeneration.  Brothers of the Sonic Cloth believe that dying is easy—it takes strength to breathe.  Midway through 2007, after casting off many of the destructive forces inherent to the human condition, ‘Brother’ Tad Doyle (TAD, Hog Molly) decided it was time to pick up his guitar and once again play live music.  Together with his fiancé, ‘Brother’ Peg Tully AKA Pegadeth (Noisegod, Inciting Riots)  form the core unit of Brothers of the Sonic Cloth. <br><br> BOTSC established an alternating smoldering and roaring doom metal sound in their early recordings: Reemus Maximus, Snooch, and Wrecked Nation.  In 2009, the first official BOTSC demo containing the tracks “La Mano Poderosa” and “I Am” were mixed at Studio Witch Ape in Seattle and made into a limited edition CD that sold all 50 copies almost overnight.  The over twenty-minute-long two song demo reveals the Brothers’ supernatural ability to defy universal laws by showing that the question of time is irrelevant.  As noted by www.Stonerrock.com: "The tunes here are given space to breathe and shift, growing unhurriedly, in the case of the first track, into a towering mountain of riffs. La Mano Poderosa’s opening guitar rides a ‘breaking storm’ sound effect into the first minute of the track, beginning a series of changes that cycle repeatedly back into the main theme/vocal part."  The effect for the listener is one of physical time being suspended as the auditory experience appears to occur simultaneously in both a single moment and over several hours. <br><br> A split 10 inch on vinyl with Mico De Noche released on Violent Hippy Records has just been made available with the latest BOTSC outing entitled, “Fires Burn Dim in the Shadows of the Mountain”. This epic twelve minute work finds the Bros. bellowing forth enormous sound waves that move with all the intent and might of lava engulfing all in its path before drifting gently into a vast still ocean of powerful beauty. Beauty that pays homage to classic Floyd and Sabbath as well as echoing their contemporaries YOB, Neurosis and the Christpunchers, but with a signature sound all their own. <br><br> From the ashes of despair born of isolation, the Brothers of the Sonic Cloth now rise. Using thick, low-tuned guitar, distortion and feedback, they create music that establishes a connection between and among themselves and their audience.  It is a power that lies both within them and beyond them that allows the music that they create to bind them like brothers to those who listen. <br><br> -Brandy Rettig <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Brothers+Of+The+Sonic+Cloth">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
