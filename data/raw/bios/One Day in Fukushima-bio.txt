GRIND MINCECORE band started in 2013 by two young musicians from Eboli (Italy). At date they has only recorded three tracks, but the want promise new stuff soon. Its sound is similar to bands like Napalm Death, Agathocles, Cripple Bastards, Nasum, Looking For an Answer... with simple structures, high speed and short songs.
