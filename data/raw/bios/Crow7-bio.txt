We are CROW7 - a band formed in Kirchlengern, Germany of young musicians with great ambitions and a terrific appearance on stage. We all live rock music and we're giving this feeling to our marvelous fans. CROW7 celebrates the „good old“ guitar rock, but also using new elements in the mix. A new melodic rock metal sound is borne with a unique dynamic sound. CROW 7 is very proud that the final mix and mastering has been done by Siggy Bem. His Woodhouse® Studios is a brand name that guarantees highest quality of sound, and is well-known all over the world. The Album “Light in my Dungeon” is bright, bohemian rock with new expression in every point of view.
