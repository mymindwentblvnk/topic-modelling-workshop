You Say Party (known as You Say Party! We Say Die! until June 2010) is a dancepunk band which formed in Abbotsford, British Columbia, Canada in 2004. The band consists of Becky Ninkovic (vocals), Derek Adam (guitar), Stephen O'Shea (bass) and Krista Leowen (keyboards). The band took a brief hiatus in the Spring of 2010 after drummer Devon Clifford died of a brain hemorrhage on April 18, 2010 two days after collapsing on stage during a show in Vancouver. On June 22, 2010, the band announced they had changed their name to "You Say Party" and also announced that keyboardist Krista Loewen had left the band. Two members of the band Gang Violence, Robert Andow and Bobby Siadat, will replace Leowen and Clifford. The band disbanded in 2011. In 2012, the surviving original members announced they had reunited.
