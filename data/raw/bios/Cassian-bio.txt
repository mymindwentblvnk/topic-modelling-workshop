It’s been a year since Cassian’s last EP. And where has the kid with that haircut been? He’s been in the busy, that’s where he’s been.

The lead single ‘I Like What You’re Doing’ has already been premiered on BBC Radio 1 by Jaymo & Andy George as part of their “Picks of 2011” show. It takes on the form of a powerhouse party psalm. Charged by an ever-familiar bassline and anthemic vocal performed by a shadowy, old-school Australian music identity. It’s turned into an 80’s fire-funk workout by Lorenz Rhode on his ‘Dangerous Mix’ and a filtered robo-haus jammer in his ‘Rhythm composer mix’. ‘Getting High’ is an ode to newfangled clubbers, to those who come out every week and just want to party. Samples are cut up ala Iron Chef and the second half of the song explodes with a twisting acid line (used to great effect on The Courtesans remix). ‘Nobody’ is appropriately named as it’s a song for everybody. The song chugs along at a slow pace and features a climactic crescendo of geetars, peeeano, seeeeenths and vibreeeeephone in the breakdown. New Bris-Vegas deeeeesco legends Mitzi turn it inside out and push the pace up to turn it into a groover and moover.

Already this year Cassian has begun his busy World Tour to support the EP with 13 sold out dates across the USA. He’s since lit up dancefloors across Europe and Asia before returning to Australia for an action-packed 6 week run in April/May taking in Creamfields festival (Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane), Chinese Laundry (Sydney), Bowler Bar (Brisbane), Electric Circus (Adelaide), Ambar (Perth) and Super Disco – his exclusive Melbourne residency. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cassian">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
