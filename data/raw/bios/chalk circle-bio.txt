There are 2 bands with the name "Chalk Circle"

1. The early 1980's Washington DC female new wave/punk rock band that performed 2 songs featured on the comp 'Mixed Nuts Don't Crack' on Outside Records.

Chalk Circle was: Anne Bonafede (drums), Sharon Cheslow (guitar/vocals), Mary Green (vocals/guitar) and Chris Niblack (bass)


2. Hailing from Newcastle, ON (near Oshawa), the alternative rock band that took their name from Bertolt Brecht's play "The Caucasian Chalk Circle".

They mixed 80s alt/rock sounds with thought provoking lyrics on their 1986 debut release The Great Lake. At times being political, on songs like "This Mourning" (about the threat of nuclear annihilation) or "N.I.M.B.Y." (about environmental disasters), the band could also rock out on tracks like their innovative cover of T-Rex's "20th Century Boy" (bonus track added to their debut album's US release) and their own break out Canadian singles "April Fool" and "My Myself and I", the latter which displayed insightful lyrics about Jungian analysis.  The production by talented Chris Wardman featured Chris Tait's upfront searing vocals, which lead many to compare the band's 'radio friendly sound' to the then breaking U2. 

Sadly the band went their own separate ways after only two albums (and a fantastic debut EP). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Chalk+Circle">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
