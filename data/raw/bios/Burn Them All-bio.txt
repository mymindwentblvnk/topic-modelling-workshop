Burn Them All was established February 14th, 2009, with musicians that hailed from numerous genres of one collective genre: Metal. Burn Them All unites the common goal to destroy all that is sacred, all that is established, and all that is "normal." We do not care what is taken from our lyrics, or our music, and we hope people act them out accordingly.
