Medlar is a deep house DJ and producer signed to Wolf Music. In 2013 he has released his debut album called Sleep.

He is one of the three WOLF resident producers. He appeared for the first time on WOLF in June 2011 with 'Terrell', immediately cementing his place as a producer within the record boxes of many of the major players in the deep house scene. In 2012 he continued to release original material exclusively through WOLF, and his demand as a remixer was cemented.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Medlar">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
