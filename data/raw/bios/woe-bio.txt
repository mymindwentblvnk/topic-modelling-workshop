1) A Philadelphia/South Jersey band, created to make black metal (early 2007). Intended as nothing more than a casual experiment, it changed from bedroom project, to an obsession. The rules - no: drum machines, corpse paint, 'Renaissance faerie-speak or faking - Honest, dark black metal, faithful to tradition & without cliches. Woe plays aggressive, hypnotic music, with themes of Satanism, elitism, & loss. The first LP, A Spell for the Death of Man, was released in 2008. Official site: http://Quietly.WoeUnholy.com

2) A London, UK band (formed 2008). Official site: http://mySpace.com/WoeSpace

3) A Southend-on-Sea, UK band that strove to make the familiar strange by infusing their rock with a fierce and heavy streak of experimentalism and number of left field stylistic elements. The British quartet came at their compositions with the spirit of punk and the desire - if not necessarily the requisite experience - to play jazz. A big, spooky rhythm section drives Woe's music, building the hypnotism factor, which is only increased thanks to layered trumpet, sax, and guitar, and lots of dub delay. Sometimes the songs are barely contained chaos, sometimes they are slinky and elegant.

4) An Australian harmonic stoner rock band, from Adelaide.  Official site: http://www.myspace.com/woeband

5) Traditional doom/heavy metal from Tasmania, Australia
