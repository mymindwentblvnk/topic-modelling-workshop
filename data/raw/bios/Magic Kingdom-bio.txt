Magic Kingdom is a Belgian power metal band created in 1998 by guitarist Dushan Petrossi (also founder of another power metal band called Iron Mask). They recently picked Olaf Hayer (Luca Turilli, Dionysus...) as their new singer (since Max Leclercq has left for Fairyland).

For Dushan Petrossi it does matter whether a song is impressive because of the technical virtuosity of the instrumentalist or whether it also has a memorable tune suitable for normal music-lovers. "My compositions are always based on melodies you will remember. The listener should be able to keep the melody in mind, should be able to hum it and not be overpowered by the instrumentation." The interesting thing about this statement is the fact that Petrossi has the reputation of being an excellent guitarist, often described by the music press as being the legitimate heir to the Yngwie Malmsteen throne. But as we already said, for the guitar genius, there is more to a composition than ego manic self-importance. And it is just this that he proves on the second album "Metallic Tragedy" of his band Magic Kingdom, the appearance of which marks five years since the bands suitably named debut work "The Arrival". It was five years in which Petrossi and Co. had to conquer numerous setbacks, which however did nothing to dampen the energy and overflowing cauldron of ideas of "Metallic Tragedy".
