Souls At Zero was an American thrash metal band. They were originally known as Wrathchild America. Wrathchild America became a casualty of the grunge-era, being dropped from Atlantic Records.  The name change occurred after Wrathchild America was dropped from Atlantic Records in 1993, and was accompanied by a slight change in musical style. Souls At Zero released three albums on Energy Records before disbanding in the mid-1990s. Changing their look and style, they became Souls at Zero, and moved to Energy Records where they recorded 'Souls At Zero' (1993), 'Six-T-Six' EP (1994). Shannon Larkin left the band in 1994 to fill the drum seat in Ugly Kid Joe; and some time later in Godsmack as well. Jamie Miller replaced Larkin, and played on 'A Taste for the Perverse' (1995) - what would became the bands' last album. After touring in support of A Taste for the Perverse, the band broke up. As of 2017, Wrathchild America has reformed. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Souls+at+Zero">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
