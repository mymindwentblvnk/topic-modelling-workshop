With influences as far reaching as 80's Swedish Doom Metal and Composers of the Italian High Renaissance , 'Sky Shadow Obelisk' emerges out of the detritus of the current vacuous musical landscape. Probing the very essence of sound and exploring new timbral realms, 'Sky Shadow Obelisk' boldly takes it's place in a musical lineage that has been broken for far too long. Dealing with the difficult subject of Western Civilization's imminent decline, 'Sky Shadow Obelisk' explores the philosophical questions of transient existence as well as the environmental effects of a wasteful and destructive race. There is a poetry in demise, and 'Sky Shadow Obelisk' revels in the beauty of mankind's irreversible fall from grace. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sky+Shadow+Obelisk">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
