Rosie Thomas (born 1978 in Livonia, Michigan) is an American singer-songwriter. In the late 1990s she toured with the band Velour 100 before deciding to go solo.

In the 1990s Thomas met Trey Many through mutual friends and began playing shows with Velour 100. They recorded one EP together in 1999 and played a few short tours, during which time she met Damien Jurado and Pedro the Lion. She then moved to Seattle to attend Cornish College briefly before deciding to focus on a solo recording career. Her appearance on the song "Parking Lot", from Damien Jurado's album Ghost of David, brought her to the attention of famed record label Sub Pop who signed her in 2000.

Her debut album When We Were Small was released on 22 January 2001. The album featured Eric Fisher (who Thomas met at performance art school in Seattle) on guitar and keyboards and Andy Myers on drums.

Fisher and Myers returned for 2003's follow-up Only With Laughter Can You Win.

Thomas released her third album, If Songs Could Be Held, in 2005.

Her fourth album These Friends of Mine, was recorded in collaboration with Sufjan Stevens who plays guitar and banjo as well as providing some vocals, and Denison Witmer. 

She released a holiday album called A Very Rosie Christmas in November 2008 through her own record label.

Her 2012 album is entitled "With Love". The same year she relocated to New York City from Seattle.
