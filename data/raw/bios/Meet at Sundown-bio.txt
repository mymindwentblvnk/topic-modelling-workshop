Meet At Sundown are central Pennsylvaniaâ€™s ONLY heavy southern metal band.

Formed in 2006 in the backwoods of Perry County, Meet At Sundown have grown a following of fans who recognize something entirely different when they hear it.

Meet At Sundown combine the melodies and rhythm of good old boy country, the classic riffs of rock and roll, and the intensity of heavy metal in a distinctive blend that is as fine as a barrel-aged Kentucky bourbon.

Meet At Sundown have been making waves within the local scene, getting notable media attention from local radio stations, newspapers, and magazines. And their 2011 self-titled EP has been downloaded in more than 25 countries!

The band is equally at home playing with hard rock, punk, psychobilly, and hardcore acts and is looking to expand their influence outside of central Pennsylvania to Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Baltimore, Washington D.C., and beyond.
