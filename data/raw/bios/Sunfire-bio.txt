There are 2 bands named Sunfire:

1: A Dutch folk band
The four troubadours of Sunfire compose tales about these hard times and work as much as they can to entertain the audience with gritty and quite dance-able Alternative Western Folk. Influenced by Americana, Roots, blues and a pinch of sweet, good olâ€™ fiddle music this four-headed band gets a unique sound unlike any other.

2: Sunfire was an American soul/funk trio based in New York.
They are best remembered for "Young, Free and Single" written by Rowland Smith, produced by Reggie Lucas and released by Warner Brothers in 1982.
Members were Raymond Calhoun, Reggie Lucas, Rowland Smith. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sunfire">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
