The band was formed in 1996 by the following members: Peralta Miguel:bass, Farkas Péter:drums and Mihály Gergely: vocals/guitar. There was only one change of members in the history of Angertea, after having recorded our first demo tape with six songs (Hangok a ködben ("Voices In Fog")), in 1998 Péter left the band and Bárkai László took his place. We published two more demos (”Minden, mire emlékeznél” (in english: "Everything, What You Remember") in 1998 and ”Promo 2001” in 2001), a full-length album (”Lélekvágy” ("Soulwish") in 2002) and a kind of ”Best of” collection of the Hungarian era (1997-2003...). Besides these we have made videos for our songs ”Halálba hív” ("Calls Into Death") and ”Hidak belül” ("Bridges Within"). The band has played in several Hungarian towns and festivals (Sziget, Wanted Festival etc.) In 2003 we decided to switch into English. Our second album “Rushing Towards The Hateline” was released on the 10th of April 2006. We play unique experimental metal music without any compromises and limits. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Angertea">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
