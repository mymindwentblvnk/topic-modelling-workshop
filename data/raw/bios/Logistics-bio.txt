Logistics is the stage name of Matt Gresham, a music producer and DJ from Cambridge, England. He is signed to Hospital Records and has been releasing music since 2004, which he creates using the Reason and Ableton sequencers. His music style tends towards the more soul-influenced styles of drum & bass but also targeted at a club audience rather than a home audience, and is described as such by Hospital Records as "bridging the gap between a lacklustre sub-genre, liquid funk, and more exciting, dancefloor orientated drum and bass". His older brother, Dan Gresham, known as Nu:Tone, is also a drum and bass producer signed to Hospital Records, with whom Matt collaborated under the name Nu:Logic before starting his career as a solo artist. They both still collaborate sometimes, both on producing and DJing.
