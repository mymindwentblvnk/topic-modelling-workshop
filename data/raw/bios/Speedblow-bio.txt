Speedlow came into being in March 2009 by John T and Costas P. Elements such as devotion and stubbornness (in the good way), melody, heaviness, energy, groove, originality (as far as possible, given the times we live in) and above all, the will to work as much as needed to reach the bands goals and meet its expectations, combine the founding stone of the band.
Speedblow plays heavy metal music with influences from the heavy rock and doom genres, with a strong presence of melody, harmony and rhythm.
In August 2009 the SPEEDBLOW EP was released, consisted of 4 tracks.
In September 2009 the band started working on its upcoming debut album "Fields Of Doom" which was released in February 2010.
Speedblow is a strongly motivated band that will continuously make music and support it in any way possible, even if it means relocating in another part of this world....or another. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Speedblow">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
