Ukrainian mittelalter-rock band.

The F.R.A.M. music band appeared at the dawn of millennium, when the music born by the change of epochs entered our hearts once and for all.. When the hundreds of faces which had passed through us had become one, when the unbridled guitar roar and the magic sound of ancient bagpipe, stone walls of large cities and hasty silver gait of the flute, quiet talk of the violin and wind and glance of ineffable hope on the other side of neon lights wanderers' eyes had become a single whole, our hearts opened to inevitable future and to assumed past. And we go along the thin border between fear and abysm of nihility, leaving a gray rain beyond the gloomy window and the papers with the rhymed lines, crumpled as though writhed from pain, behind us. And on the threshold of the winter we knock on the April's doors and we charm the coming night, we set the birds free and we create the magic of reckless dance. But in the weak moments and minutes of scruple, when we want to lose our heart and disappear into the dark, we tell ourselves: "Fram!" - it is an ancient war-cry of the northern warriors... Forward! Do or die! And we shake off the numbness of centuries and equip ourselves for the journey to the new expanses. Thus, all our songs are about love and death. And there is no point in singing about anything else.
