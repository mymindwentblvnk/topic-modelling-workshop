Blood Haven arose from the pits of hell in 2001. Their mission was as clear then as it is now, Destroy Christianity, its hold over mankind and the way our civilization is stagnating into oblivion! To do this, chaos must be created! Thus Blood Haven unleash upon the unsuspectiong populace, RELIGIOUS SUFFOCATION! Equal parts Thrash and Black Metal, blending brutal complex guitar riffs, blood churning bass-lines, and intricate, well thought-out drum patterns with hateful and inspiring lyrics barked forth in a demonic vocal attack! Blue-prints of Armageddon, clearly the album's masterpiece, is a brutal epic blackened thrash assault!
