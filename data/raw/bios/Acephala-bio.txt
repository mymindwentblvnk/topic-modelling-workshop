Acephala started in the middle of 2004 by Val (drums) and Dooms (bass). After some time they've found good guitar player Tokis. From this time main target was to create one of the most brutal death metal band in Ukraine and well recognised band in world UG scene. Music stuff was orientated to the new wave of brutal death metal with roots from faster & heavier bands ever. We played a lot of gigs before we've recorded our first promo 2007 at "Hot Jam Studio" after that work, Dooms left the band. Then Acephala recorded it's first album "Infraction Cerebral Occupation" with Maxuta on vocals, who became a part of the band. Album was released in january 2008 under Sound Age prod. and More Hate prod. Now band have full line-up with Evgen on bass and Podmigor on second guitar. So we are on a way to second full lenght album, and have a lot of future shows.
