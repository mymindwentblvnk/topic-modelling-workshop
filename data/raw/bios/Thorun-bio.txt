Thorun are a 4 piece instrumental stoner-sludge rock band from South Wales, UK. Formed in early 2010 by like minded fools with a desire to create a sound based upon the noise inside their heads. This is riff worship!

Brand new EP "Chorus Of Giants" now streaming from: http://thorun.bandcamp.com/

Our first EP is available for free from Bandcamp.
