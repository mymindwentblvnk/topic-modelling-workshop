KILMARA was founded in September 2003 by Javi (Drums), Jony (Guitars), Kike (Guitars), Wolf (Vocals) and Borja (Bass).  In 2005, Salva joined the band to replace Borja and Kilmara found its final and stable line up.
Numerous concerts followed, including gigs supporting big Spanish national acts like SARATOGA or BARON ROJO. 
Two Demo CDs were released in 2004 (Demasiado Viejo) and in 2005 (The deceit), before KILMARA recorded its first Studio-CD “Hunting dreams” in 2006/2007. The CD was self-produced by KILMARA and mastered by Rolf Munkes (Empire Studios/Germany) who apart from running his actual bands EMPIRE and RAZORBACK, collaborated with artists like Tony Martin, Mike Terrana, Don Ayrey or Doogie White.
