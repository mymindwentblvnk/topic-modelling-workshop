Black Kids Bassist Recruits Camera Obscura, Magnetic Fields, Vivian Girls Members for Duets

You may know Owen Holmes as the bassist for indie pop band Black Kids. But now he's branching out on his own. Well, not totally on his own. Under the name Gospel Music, Holmes is releasing a five-track EP called Duettes, featuring (uh) duets with Camera Obscura's Tracyanne Campbell, Vivian Girls' Cassie Ramone, the Magnetic Fields' Shirley Simms, Hefner's Darren Hayman, and French singer-songwriter SoKo. (To clear up any confusion: While the project is called Gospel Music, it does not consist of gospel music as much as twee-leaning pop.) The record is out on limited edition 10" and download November 29 via Fierce Panda.
