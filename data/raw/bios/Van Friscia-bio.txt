Taken from Van's official Facebook page, and adjusted to the third person.

Van Friscia became known to the world when, one day, a track called Epic Symphony in A Flat Minor, First Movement: Marching Out was released for download on the Rock Band Network for Xbox 360. Two things happened - #1, he claimed the title of Longest Song Name in Rock Band history; and #2, amazingly, somehow, hundreds of people downloaded it all over the world. He literally expected about 10 sales, including family and friends.

His favorite quote from people trying to look him up online is "Who or what the hell is a Van Friscia?" Van Friscia is just one person.  He is primarily a composer and guitarist, but he also dabbles in bass, drums, piano, and vocals. More recently, he has discovered the power of modern synthesizers to bring full orchestras to his music, which you can hear in his Epic Symphony. He has been writing and recording in his spare time for years in his modest home recording studio, but never had an outlet for it. Then Rock Band Network came along, and he thought, well, why not?

Up to that point, he had never even thought about a name, and most of hos work was untitled as well. He and his brother (also a guitarist) used to joke about being the new-age Van Halen brothers, (albeit with approximately 1% of the talent). So, there was a name he could use. Then, he needed to name this piece that he wrote. He thought, "Well, it sounds... Epic. That'll do."

So, he doesn't really know where this is going to lead him, but since some people seem to be interested in his music (and believe me, he's incredibly flattered and tickled pink that you are), the least he could do is create something so that people aren't left in the dark. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Van+Friscia">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
