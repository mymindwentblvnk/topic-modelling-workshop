B U R N S was born in Glasgow on Halloween in 1985. His mother was an artist and painter. His father was a professional heavyweight boxer. Growing up, watching both parents work made a deep impression on BURNS and combined to give him an appreciation of both beauty and power, a combination that comes through in his own work, in his love of melody and of sonic impact. 

B U R N S began making music at age twelve, playing guitar and keyboards before discovering sampling as a teenager. Again his parents diverse tastes served him well. BURNS inherited musical interests evolved as he became aware of the French electronic producers of the mid- nineties with the emergence of labels such as Crydamoure, Vulure and Roule and artists like Daft Punk, Cassius and Le Knight Club revolutionising the music scene. As he listened, BURNS consciously studied the records becoming determined to lift his own production skills.

Fast forward to 2000 and at the age of 15 BURNS had started producing his own tracks. Combining sound hardware from the seventies and eighties with modern music software and samples, B U R N S started to produce hundreds of demos, experimenting as he began to define his signature sound. Now, at 23, BURNS is working on his debut album and has a whole series of releases planned for 2009. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Burns">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
