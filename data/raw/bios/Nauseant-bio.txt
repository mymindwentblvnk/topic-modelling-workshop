2004 - Nauseant began their journey in the latter days of this year. Back then there were the founding members Kalle Fagerberg on guitars, Albert Wifstrand on drums and Per Olsson on the bass guitar who spawned tracks in the depths of Stockholm's suburbia. They created their first track entitled "Öpööl" on December 9th and then they were on their way, with inspiration and a new progressive concept.

2005 - When they had some material to work with they started to rehearse. Though, the rehearsing didn't last for too long due to economic issues so the band went underground and focused on new material to complete a future demo release.

In September they finally found a decent rehearsal place with proper equipment and they took off. 

2006 - In February Per Olsson left the band, due to different musical visions and lack of sufficient techniques. But, just a few days after the statement, David Axman immediately declared interest in the bass duties and filled the void. Also, at approximately the same time as David connected with them, and joins them on second guitar.

In May they released their debut demo "Abysmaltician", a three-track demo.

Upcoming release: "Iln" - 7 tracked EP.
Scheduled release date: Unknown.
