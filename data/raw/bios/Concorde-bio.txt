Only the privileged few can say they've been at the controls of a flying Concorde—history (actually, the Museum of Flight down on Marginal Way) tells us there have been more U.S. astronauts than pilots of the permanently grounded supersonic airline fleet. Likewise, Concorde the band is helmed by a handful of elites: His Lordship Jack Durban (vox/guitars), Lady Starkat of West Durham (vox/keyboards), Duke Xavier of Barcelona (bass), Baron Buggy Sampson (guitar), and General Train (drums). On their debut album, Mess I'm Made Of, this ..ber-stylish ensemble—members resemble KGB agents, Eastern European femme fatales, and '70s porn stars—sounds as chic as it looks. Midnight guitar chords brush up against slinky bass lines, new-wavey synths, refined six-string melodies, and the scintillating vocal interplay between Durban and Starkat (think Billy Corgan romancing Saint Etienne's Sarah Cracknell) to swank, sexy ends. - MICHAEL ALAN GOLDBERG <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Concorde">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
