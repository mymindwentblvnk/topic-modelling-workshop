Soul Enema was formed in Israel and active since 2001. The band is combining conventional melodic rock aspects with occasionaly more experimental way of writing. Demo EP containing five tracks was released around 2003. During the last years the band was working on a debut album titled "Thin Ice Crawling". The album's style is influenced by progressive rock and metal, ethnic, psychodelic, jazz-fusion and sympho-rock elements, with a somewhat theatrical approach to the lyrics. It can be taken both on a platform of a concept story and on an individual, independent issue of each track. In the fall of 2009, after many delays, the work on "Thin Ice Crawling" was completed and it's set to be released in the beginning of 2010. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Soul+Enema">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
