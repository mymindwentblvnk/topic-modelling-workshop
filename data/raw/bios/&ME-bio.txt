Real Name: André Boadu, DJ and producer from Berlin, Germany. 

When one could assume, &ME entered the House and Techno world somewhat out of the blue, it is due to his sublime modesty that’s already captured in his alias. Coming from Hamburg to Berlin in 2004 his talent was soon recognized by folks like DJ Hell or DJ T. who hired him as their co-producer. 
Besides, he was playing the clubs (national and international) all week every week and putting his effort in remixes for the likes of Roxy Music, Tiefschwarz or Anthony Rother. But as soon as he dropped his first solo productions, he finally made himself a name in a quite unparalleled way. “F.I.R.” – his first release on keinemusik, a collective of Berlin based DJs and producers, he helped founding in 2009, was a massive clubhit, but in the end not much more than a foretaste of things to come. Releases and remixes on Front Room, Souvenir, Rebirth, Liebe*Detail, Saved etc. followed, his reputation as a gifted producer and DJ extraordinaire spread even more into international realms, and that’s where he stands right now, as his blend of Techno and soulful Housemusic took incredible shape: Many new projects in focus and clearly visible as one of the most unique and original figures in the game. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/&ME">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
