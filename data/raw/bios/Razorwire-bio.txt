In March 2003, Razorwire released their debut album LEAGUE OF THE GODLESS which received excellent reviews all over the world. A seemingly never-ending tour followed which took them all over the UK from Aberdeen to Penzance, and everywhere in between. They also played a handful of dates in Germany, Belgium and Holland. 

The bands music is a diverse mix of traditional metal, rap, punk and hardcore with loads of energy. Razorwire have been likened to artists such as Anthrax, One Minute Silence, Therapy?, Stuck Mojo and Suicidal Tendencies, but have forged their own sound and identity by constantly pushing themselves forward musically, and never being afraid to experiment and evolve. 

Razorwire have always had a D.I.Y ethic which has gained them respect in punk and hardcore circles, as well as metal. Guitarist Dan Peach formed the Psychophonic label back in 1999 which has helped release albums for numerous up and coming bands as well as Razorwire. In addition to organising all their own gigs and tours, Razorwire are also responsible for the Godless festival in Stoke-on-Trent (www.godlessfestival.co.uk). They believe If you support the scene, the scene will support you. 

Their second album was recorded at Warehouse Studios, Oxford (UK) in May 2005, and was produced, engineered and mixed by Steve Lord Of Metal Watkins.

In 2006, The band underwent a few line-up changes including a new singer & front man Dave Scragg (Kismet HC, Fuck Hate Propaganda). The new Razorwire have done numerous gigs in the UK and Holland, and have recently released their third Razorwire album "Wrapped In Lies". The album has already recieved great reviews from the national music press.
