Daedric Tales was formed back in the year 2009 by the guitar player Yra (ex-On Concrete, Nuclear Monstrosity). Yra thought that the epic Elder Scrolls saga deserves a fittingly epic band. Soon he found the guitarist Jakob and together they wrote some songs. After a year and a half and many many line-up changes the bassist Matz gro-Gasher, drummer Sam and Nal, who played the keyboard, joined the band. In January 2011 the vocalist Lili joined the band.
In June 2012 Lili, Nal and Samuel left the band.
In August 2012 vocalist Alex, the keyboarder Gonzalo and the new guitarist Daniel (ex-Dragony) joined the band and together they recorded their first EP "Hircine's Call". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Daedric+Tales">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
