2. Rabe (which is german for "Raven") was a Raw Black Metal band from Oostmalle, Belgium. It was formed by Sarmak (also played in Lycanthropy's Spell) in 2004. Later Svartulv (sometimes also called M.S.) joined the band and completed the line-up.

In 2004 they recorded a demo tape called "Chapel Of Souls ". Later, in 2005, they released their first and only demo tape "Rabe" which is strictly limited to 30 copies.

Unfortunately Sarmak died of a heart failure on 9th september the same year and therefore Rabe split-up. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rabe">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
