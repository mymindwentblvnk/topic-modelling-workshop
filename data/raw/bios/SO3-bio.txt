Biography

SO3 was formed in San Diego, CA in late 2006 by purveyors of guitar-driven, blues-infused rock, drawn together by a shared appreciation for ripping guitar solos, deep throbbing bass, melodic hooks, and thrashing (yet tasteful) drum beats. Since then, SO3, which features Mike Artamonov on guitar and vocals, Serge Belongie on bass guitar and vocals and Alan Clark on drums, has taken its act coast to coast across the US and beyond, delighting fans from San Diego to NYC to London. With a sound emblematic of the diverse San Diego music scene, one moment SO3 will serenade you with a sorrowful blues jam and the next moment you will be grooving to indie dance pop.

The Caltech Connection

SO3's contributions to the PHD Movie soundtrack came from a chance introduction between SO3 band member Serge Belongie and PhD Comics creator Jorge Cham by Bill Bing, the director of bands at Caltech. Serge had known Bill from his undergrad days at Caltech and stayed in touch over the years, even returning at one point to record material for his band's first CD at the Caltech music studio.

Serge, who has an Erd≈ës number of 2 and a Bacon number of 3, earned his PhD from the U. of California Berkeley and currently lives in San Diego, where he holds a day job as a professor of Computer Science in the Jacobs School of Engineering at the U. of California San Diego. In 2007 he co-founded the Jacobs School of Rock (JSOR), an annual concert series featuring bands with engineers who rock.
