There are multiple artists with the name "Liberator"

1. Liberator first got together 1993 in Malmo, Sweden. Starting out, they earned a local reputation as a highly energetic live act, with music firmly rooted in the 2-tone tradition, spiced up with some classic, old school ska. 
At this time it was mostly covers on the menu (e.g. Madness, Specials, The Beat), but soon original songs were made as well.

The band hooked up with manager Tobbe Lorentz, and together they were able to land a recording deal with punk/hardcore label Burning Heart Records.

During the years that followed Liberator made several tours in most European countries and became known as one of the beacons in "The Third Wave" of ska.
