There are two artists with the name Requital:

1) Requital was founded in early 2004 in Berlin Germany. 

2005 was the year with the first sign of life in form of a promo and the self produced EP "They Shall Die" which can now be considered as an ode to their Thrash Metal roots. 

In 2006 the band accomplished radical changes in their lineup and the music as well. The recruiting of new members who were musicial and technical more adepted led Requital to turn into a Death Metal hybrid with modern and oldschool influences and melodical depth.

In autumn 2006, they hit the studio to record the next, yet untitled EP
In early year 2007 the second EP was released, titled Second to None.
