Coming from all 3 corners of Quebec, Jean-Nicolas, Jean-Phillipe and Maxime have quickly established themselves as the new ambassadors of local electro. In just over a year they have gone from completely unknown to playing in front of thousands of people, whether it was at Igloofest or more recently at the I Love NEON 10 year anniversary.

- Le Matos is slang for "The Equipment" in french.
- All members of the group emanate from the hardcore scene and could be described as straight edge (no alcohol, no drugs).
- Their first and only official release is 88mph on Saboteur Records.
