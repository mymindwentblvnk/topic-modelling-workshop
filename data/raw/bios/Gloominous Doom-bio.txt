“The Feature” is Reading, PA-based experimental metal quintet The Gloominous Doom’s second full-length for DRP Records, who will be releasing the album on CD and digitally in Spring 2010. Clocking in at just under an hour, “The Feature” totals fifteen songs, and comes jam-packed with tongue-in-cheek humor, razor-sharp riffs, thrashing mayhem, punk attitude, death metal ferocity, low-slung reggae grooves, and just a dash of drag-racin’ PBR-guzzlin’ backwoods flair. The Gloominous Doom’s high-energy, genre-bending sonic assault and merciless work ethic have earned them scores of fans along the East Coast, as several successful tours and a triumphant performance at 2009’s CMJ Music Marathon in New York City made clear. This, in addition to a well-received split 7” and ensuing tour with Relapse recording artists Rumpelstiltskin Grinder, has directed plenty of industry attention towards the GD camp. The boys have been hard at work raisin’ hell, keeping that buzz going with never-ending live dates and festival appearances. With several new releases and a spring tour already in the works, it’s more than clear: The Gloominous Doom have only begun to grind.
