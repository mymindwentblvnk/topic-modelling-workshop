Winters Bane is the starting point for Judas Priest/Iced Earth/Beyond Fear's vocalist Tim Owens. A traditional Heavy Metal outfit, combining crushing guitar riffs, shredful solo's, uncompromising drumming, & of course, Tim Owens' signature piercing wail. It was from their 1993 album, 'Heart Of A Killer', that Glenn Tipton & K.K. Downing of Judas Priest decided that Tim Owens would be fit to fill the shoes of the great Rob Halford. One of the forgotten great Heavy Metal bands of the early 1990's. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Winters+Bane">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
