Echo of Life was founded in the winter of 2011 by its sole member Wander.

The central theme in the music and lyrics is Memory. Other themes that he touches upon are Personal Horror, Melancholia, Solitude, and the bittersweet nature of human existence.

Wander experiments in the styles of Blackgaze and Depressive Black Metal to show the contrast between harsh sadness and sorrow and the light dreamy side of life.
