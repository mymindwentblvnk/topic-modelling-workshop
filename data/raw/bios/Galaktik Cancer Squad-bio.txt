Galaktik Cancer Squad is an ambitious project from Hamburg, Germany. It was formed by Argwohn in 2011 
and combines the ability of progressive metal with the aggression of black metal. 

The name "Galaktik Cancer Squad" was intended to be a song for Uranus Explodes, a side-project formed 
in 2004, but the material was too heavy for a post-rock based experimental project, so it became an
independent space black metal project. The first full-length "Eroberer" was written in a few days after
forming in late august of 2011. It changed directly into the main project and more songs came up with 
several splits and an EP.

In december 2011 the songwriting for the second full-length "Strange Spheres of Hyperborea" started and
the recordings were finished in march 2012. This album reached a new level of modern metal music and
its instrumental works with over 20 minutes playtime are just not of this world. 
When words can't describe the feelings about time and space, the music takes over and guides you through
unknown spheres of creativity and explosive atmospheres. Because of that GCS has almost no vocals. 

Besides cosmic and philosophical themes, GCS deals with pretty human problems like drugs and 
depressions, always looking into the abyss of the human mind.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Galaktik+Cancer+Squad">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
