Joachim Heinz Ehrig (born 1951 in Thuringia, Germany) was the madcap drummer "Eroc" in progressive rock band Grobschnitt. As early as 1967, Eroc had developed his own methods of multi-tracking and phasing effects with voices and instruments. A talented multi-instrumentalist, his solo work is an eccentric mix of synthesizers, space-rock, comic theatrics, schlager and folk musics.

Since the 1970's, Eroc has also worked as an remastering engineer for new and digital re-releases for the following artists:
Amon Düül II, Art of Noise, Alvin Lee, Beggar’s Opera, Canned Heat, Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick & Tich, The Easybeats, Eric Burdon & The Animals, Frankie Goes To Hollywood, Frankie Miller, Gentle Giant, Giorgio Moroder, Ian Gillan, Herman’s Hermits, Johnny & The Hurricanes, Magna Carta, Nazareth, The Pretty Things, Quintessence, Spooky Tooth, Steamhammer, The Troggs, UFO, The Yardbirds, Birth Control, Farfarello, Grobschnitt, Guru Guru, Phillip Boa & The Voodooclub, Propaganda, Tic Tac Toe.
