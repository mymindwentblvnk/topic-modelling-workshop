There is more than one artist with this name: 

1. 
Canadian rock band that had one self titled album in 1977 very fast HARD ROCKIN ALBUM! 

2.
Four-piece rock band from Winnipeg, Manitoba sold more than 1500 copies of an EP produced in their parents’ basement. Their single “All That You Are” became the Number 3 most-requested song on Winnipeg radio, thanks to hometown support from the likes of 92 CITI-FM (who named the group Buzz Band of the Year two years in a row!!) and Power 97 (who included 3 tracks from the group’s debut EP on its’ Class of 2003 CD). In autumn 2004, Driver released their debut full-length album “Inhuman Nature”, featuring the Top 40 hit “She Laughed At Me”. The video for the song garned the band attention nationwide when MuchMusic added the clip to their playlist in medium rotation right out of the gate. The band followed up with the title track “Inhuman Nature” scoring another hit - the video was also added directly into rotation on both MuchMusic and MuchLoud. With three producers in the band, the level of professionalism evident in Driver’s music shouldn’t surprise anyone. But as strong as the group is on disc, it’s on stage where Driver really knocks it out of the ballpark! 

3.
Heavy Metal band formed in Los Angeles, California, in 1989.
Original 1990 line up featured:  Rob Rock on vocals, Roy Z on guitar, Emil Lech Brando on bass, Butch Carlson on drums and Greg Shultz on keyboards.
This line up recorded an EP called "Driver" in 1990 and split up the same year.
The band reformed in 2007 and in 2008 they released the new album, "Sons of Thunder".
