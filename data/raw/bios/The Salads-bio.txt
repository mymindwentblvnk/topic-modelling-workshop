The Salads are a punk rock band with strong reggae/ska tendencies, originally from Newmarket, Ontario, Canada. They are currently independent on their own label, Maui Wowie Records.

The group was formed in late 1996, and has had a relatively steady line-up ever since. They played many shows in the Toronto, Ontario region, eventually deciding to start recording.

In 1998, The Salads entered the studio for the first time, and recorded their debut full-length album, titled "Meanwhile...The Salads". The album went relatively unnoticed, as the band was just beginning to make a real name for themselves. However, the group went on, and continued to write new music, culminating with the release of an EP, "Who's That?", in 2001, and a second full-length album, "Fold A to B", in 2003.

This album had a much bigger impact than the self-titled debut. Catchy songs such as "Get Loose" and "The Roth Kung Fu" allowed the band to break through and get some airplay throughout Canada. Indeed, the first single, "Get Loose", was featured in a Labatt Blue commercial, which allowed the band to gain an even bigger fanbase. At this point, back-up vocalist Libydo left the band, for personal reasons. The band embarqued on a massive worldwide tour, which ended with a few dates in Australia, in October 2005.

In November 2005, the band re-entered the studio, and began recording their third full-length album, "The Big Picture". By January 2006, the album was completed. The band began a small tour of the province to try out the new material, and then released the album on May 9th. The first single from the album, "Growing Up", is currently a mild succes, and is getting a decent amount of airplay, as well as being featured on MuchMusic, MTV, and more. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Salads">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
