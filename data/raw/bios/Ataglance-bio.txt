Ataglance' foundation can be found early 2004. The regular recipe: add some friends, music and shake really well. Late July 2004 they recorded 4 tracks at the Helter Belter Studios in Wageningen. These tracks were released on a same titled EP in March 2005 on Shield Recordings; getting them to share the stage with the likes of Cult of Luna, Bleeding Through and The Bled. 

Around October 2005 they parted ways with vocalist Bram, but soon found replacement in Pim. Two new song were recorded end of May 2006 and are to be found online, but never made it to an official release. 

Ataglance called it quits in 2007. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/ataglance">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
