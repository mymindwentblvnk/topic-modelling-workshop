Crimson Sunrise is a band formally based out of Sarasota. The members include Kris Pellote, Nate Blaweiss, Rick Hoefer, and Casey something (they also feature Nick something on the song The Prisoner). Kris got caught with pot, and the band decided that since he was grounded for life, it would be for the best to find a new singer.
 
The Members of the band have composed many other local sarasota groups, such as follows

A Mandolin Minute - Nate (Mandolin) Rick (Guitar) and Casey (Shaker and shit like that)

White Stripes - Kris (Guitar), Sam All (Guitar), Josh Seymore (Bongos)

Califunk - EJ Laisheck (Vocals/Keyboards) Rick (Guitar) Nate (Percussion) Casey (Bass)

Papa Silk Fingers and The Funky Monks (Previously, The Love Stains) - EJ Laisheck (Vocals/Keyboards) Rick (Guitar) Nate (Percussion) John Everheat (Bass)

Death By Crabs - Rick (Guitar) Casey (Bass) Nate (Persusion)

Death by Crabs is currently inquiring a singer, or may perhaps rename the Califunk combination to Dath By Crabs. The title of the band is for humorous purposes, inspired by the band Primus and Les Claypool. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Crimson+Sunrise">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
