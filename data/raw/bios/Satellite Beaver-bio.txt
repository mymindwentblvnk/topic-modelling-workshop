Have you ever tried to imagine yourself space, hairy dozer furious enough to destroy planets? No wonder you did not, but now it is about time to confront one face to face. Formed in Warszawa, Poland in 2008, Satellite Beaver search for their own style and they are more stubborn than Sisyphus itself. Inspired by traditional grunge and stoner rock genres, band came a long way through different influences what in practice means searching for thickest guitar strings and biggest crash cymbals ever created. What is more, they dared to spread their "tune it lower" philosophy during live performances with local and foreign stoner bands such as Belzebong, Luna Negra / Tres Perros, Karma to Burn or Mars Red Sky.

Their destination was always clear: trip further that any beaver ever tripped.

Since the month of January 2014 known as Sunnata.
