From the city of Den Helder, The Netherlands, the band Pulverised emerged in the summer of 2005 and was formed by Cris and Sander. Influenced by a lot of U.S. Style Death metal bands like Cannibal Corpse, Dying Fetus, Suffocation and the dutch Pyaemia plus other metal acts like Pantera, they decided to start their own band and having the drive to blend all of those influences into one. The end result is some pure right in your face Death Metal.

Also in the the summer of 2007 we created our first release 'Mutilated face'.
