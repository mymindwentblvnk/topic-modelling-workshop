LIE NING is an artist from Berlin who gives a musical home to this complex bundle of emotions. He is from an environment which likewise changes its face continuously. With his velvety voice, encompassed with faint piano hammers, shimmering electronic elements and racing heartbeats the 22 year old creates a startling yet embracing intimacy. Conveyed by poised confidence and unapologetic openness the songs manage to take a look at the audience’s souls while reflecting what lies deepest within an artist who could not be more captivating. His work is greatly influenced by continued changes in his environment. Being exposed from an early age to an orchestra of languages, images and melodies, he found #music and songwriting to be his way of expressing complex emotions. Lie Ning states, "Belonging to a somewhat excluded minority in a country you are supposed to call home, experiencing childhood pre-smart-technologies, living we all travel constantly from one state of being to the other. My music is deeply inspired by the human reaction and interaction to and with these in-between moments“. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/LIE+NING">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
