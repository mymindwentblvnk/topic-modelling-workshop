Rossi is the fusion of veteran musician, Thom Donovan, and emerging Nashville native, Kendall Morgan.

Donovan’s blend of classical guitar and experimental keys make for a twistedly whimsical experience, like walking through an enchanted forest of orchestral sound.    <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rossi">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
