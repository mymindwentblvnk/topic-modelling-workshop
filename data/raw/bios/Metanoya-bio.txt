Metanoya is death metal band from Slovakia. 
The whole story takes place in Partizanske (Slovakia):

1999 - Beginning musicians Peto Rohac (drums) and his brother Palo (bass guitar) are forming the garage band together with Dodo Balcirak (guitar). Starting with playing some covers of Metallica, Megadeth, Sepultura and others, also first own riffs are created

2000 - Roman Halada (guitar) joins the band; on the contrary Dodo - having different musical feeling - leaves quite quickly. Roman has a great influence on composition progress and is sharing the same philosophy with other memebers, and the whole band's philosophy is developing too

2001 - Majzlo (guitar, vocal) fills the missing place supported also with Roman's vocals

2002 - First live show on the stage!

2003 - Setlist is filling up with own songs prevailing over covers

2004 - Unfortunatelly Palo's workload causes repeating absence on rehearsals and then step by step leaving the band. Last but not least, the band found Vacko (bass guitar), who completed the lineup with great success

2005 - Recording demo "Deserve to be alive"; Majzlo is going to USA; the band keeps playing and waiting for his return

2006 - Fester (guitar) stands in for Majzlo temporarily

2007 - The band keep working on the new ideas and songs  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Metanoya">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
