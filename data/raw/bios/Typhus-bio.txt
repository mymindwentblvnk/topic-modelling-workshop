From the unholy mind responsible for breathing life into Dark Horizon Records (Lord Typhus), comes the Satanic War Machine called TYPHUS. TYPHUS spew forth Blasphemous Unholy Black Metal striking out against the book of lies, as well as the false prophets soothsaying which held so many unfulfilled promises! TYPHUS will be the nails used to crucify Jesus Christ the second time around! The music of TYPHUS is Pure, Organic, Blasphemous, Cold, Grim, Necro, Raw, Extremely Vulgar, Christ Crushing, Black Metal.
TYPHUS will bring U.S. Black Metal into the realm of the originators and masters.
