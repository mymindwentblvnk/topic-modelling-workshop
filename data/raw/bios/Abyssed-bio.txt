Ambient Black Metal from Pakistan (Rawalpindi) . The demo ''Bejaan'' was released in 2008 which had a more ambient sound,with tracks like ''Ruined..A dream''shuruaat'' and more prominent drone influences in ''keher aur afsurdagi'' which was balanced with the title track being a blackened thrash song in Urdu language. With the release of a 3-way split in 2009, Abyssed had been on hiatus ever since and eventually disbanded and was split-up.
