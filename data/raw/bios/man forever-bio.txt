Drummer, composer and improviser John Colpitts aka Kid Millions founded Man Forever in 2010 as a vehicle for his more experimental compositional ideas. Since the founding of the ensemble Colpitts has released three albums and toured throughout the US and Europe. Man Forever compositions are vehicles through which the performer will discover and contemplate the limits of his or her physical and conscious selves. The experience of performing and hearing these compositions will be similar in their contradictions; they are at once relentless and meditative. Performers with the group have included Brian Chase, Richard Hoffman, Ryan Sawyer, James McNew, SR Palm, Chris Baio, Shahin Motia, and Greg Fox. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Man+Forever">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
