Noisy metal act based in Haugesund, Norway. The band consists of guitar demigod/growler Espen Myklebust and two other insignificant band members who desperately try to keep up with Espen's extravagant musical visions. Lyrical themes include blasphemy, misanthropy and gore. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hillbilly+Blitzkrieg">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
