George Alan Sparhawk (Seattle, Washington, USA) is a founding member of slow-core pioneers, Low (1993-present). He sings and plays guitar. Alan is a native of Duluth, Minnesota. He is married to fellow bandmember Mimi Parker.

His side projects include the blues-roots band The Black Eyed Snakes and more recently the Retribution Gospel Choir. He also released a track on a various artists compilation Songs for the End of the World as Hollis M. Sparhawk & Her Father. Beyond this he occasionally plays solo shows in his hometown, and had a solo album titled "Solo Guitar" released in August 2006.

As of 2010 he worked on several experiments under the moniker The Murder of Crows with fellow Duluthian resident Gaelynn Lea (violin, vocals, song-writing) and Alan Sparhawk (vocals, song-writing, guitar, technology). The songs are both experimental as ethereal in nature. In April 2012 the Imperfecta EP was released in a very limited edition. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Alan+Sparhawk">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
