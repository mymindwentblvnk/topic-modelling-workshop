Megasus is a Metal band formed in Providence, Rhode Island in 2006. The band was formed by current members of Lightning Bolt and ex members of Amazing Royal Crowns, Laurels and Scared Stiffs. In mid 2006, Ryan Lesser (Laurels), Jason Kendall (Amazing Royal Crowns) and Paul Lyons (Scared Stiffs) invited Dare Matheson from Made In Mexico to play drums for a recording of Red Lottery as a submission for the Playstation 2 game Guitar Hero 2. After recording Red Lottery, Megasus lost Matheson and gained Lightning Bolt bassist Brian Gibson as the new full time drummer.

Megasus quickly became one of the most controversial acts on the Guitar Hero release, polarizing audiences with the game's only inclusion of slow, doomy metal.

The band's first LP, entitled Megasus, was released on vinyl only in 2/2009. Less than a year later Megasus signed on to Olympia, WA record label 20 Buck Spin to release the recordings on CD.

Megasus has shared the stage with many cohorts such as Skeletonwitch, Doomriders, Drop Dead, Witch, Earthless, Dead Meadow, HOWL and more.

The band's sound is driven by haphazard, non-traditional drumming and ultra-low, detuned, fuzzed guitar and bass. Influences and references include acts such as Electric Wizard, Karp, Slayer, Metallica and Melvins. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Megasus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
