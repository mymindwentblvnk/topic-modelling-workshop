L'Imperatrice",  (The Empress) is beautiful and crual. Maybe not even real, a Venus with graceful movements, whose haughty look recalls the burning heat of summer. She rules the groove and the hearts, and you will bow to her desire.

The first opus will sound like a revelation, meteor dodging between funk, 90´s french house and hiphop. Her references to the joyful sound of our childhood and her melancholy journeys away from the earth. 

And the bass is more powerful than the Death Star, a bright sound, a ray that pierces the vastness of our suspicious minds. Don´t be scared, join the Empire. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/L%27Imp%C3%A9ratrice">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
