In 1995, Mudoven formed in North Branford, Connecticut as a side-project of Vaginal Jesus guitarist Jim Crow. Crow is the only musician in the band, utilizing his guitar and drum-machine. Mudoven first released their demo in 1995 titled "Hate." Then in 1997, Mudoven signed on to the now-defunct Tri-State Terror Records label, which released the 7-inch EP "Aryan Vs. Alien", a reissue of "Hate" on 7" with one long track replaced by two shorter ones. The EP cover had photos of Holocaust victims on both the cover and vinyl record. Only 1000 copies were produced, with 800 of them on black vinyl and 200 on white vinyl.

Crow still continued to play with Vaginal Jesus. They would later be featured on an MSR Productions CD compilation titled "Leaderless Resistance." Crow later expressed outrage with MSR Productions for unknown reasons.

In 1998, Crow released the track "Fighting in the Streets" (a Cockney Rejects cover) on the 7" "East vs West" (his contribution appeared on the "East" side, the A-side). Later that year, they appeared on the compilation "Tri State Terror Vol II" with the tracks "Aim and Fire" and "Don't Tread on Me". Both comps were on Tri-State Terror. They then released Mudoven's first full-length album "Truth and Tragedy: Life in the Occupied Zone" in 1999.

In 2000, Tri-State Terror finally went under.

Mudoven still continues to play and has collaborated with Arghoslent and Greek NSBM band Der Stürmer. Their work was released on Vinland Wind Records as a split 7", with the Arghoslent track on the A-side and the Mudoven and Der Stuermer songs on the B-side.

No new Mudoven material has been released since, although there have been plans to release a retrospective of their work on Deathangle Absolution Records. In 2010, their cover of GG Allin's "Violence Now" (re-titled "Mediaviolence") as well as a recording of the track "Clubbed" (renamed "Final War") were released on the German compilation "Die Deutsche kommen... mit Freunden!". Mudoven have released a statement saying that anything released after the split with Der Sturmer is a bootleg.
