South London quartet Goat Girl signed to Rough Trade in 2016, but sound like they could’ve been on the label 40 years ago when it was releasing records by The Raincoats, The Fall and Swell Maps — dirgey, spare and menacing. The group’s self-titled debut album was released in 2018, followed by On All Fours in early 2021. Whereas their debut focused on post-punk instrumentation, On All Fours expands their sonic palette to more psych and synth sounds 

The band's line-up consists of Lottie "Clottie Cream" Pendlebury (vocals, guitar),  Ellie "L.E.D." Rose Davies (guitar),  Rosy "Bones" Jones (drums), and Holly "Hole" Mullineaux (bass). The latter replaced Naima "Jelly" Redina-Bock in 2019. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/goat+girl">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
