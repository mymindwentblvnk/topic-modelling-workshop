Formed in early 2010 Lyceum recorded a demo CD and began work on an album. The music develops around concepts of heroism, empire, conflict, and corruption. The name Lyceum refers to the academy of Aristotle, the teacher of Alexander the Great, dedicated to Apollo Lyceus, instrumental in the history of western learning and philosophy. Lyceum is currently writing, recording, and performing in the Bay Area. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lyceum">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
