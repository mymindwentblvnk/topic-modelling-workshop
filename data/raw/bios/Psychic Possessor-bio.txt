Psychic Possessor (originally called Ritual) were a Brazilian thrash metal band formed in 1986. They did two demos under the name Ritual before releasing their debut as Psychic Possessor in 1988 titled "Toxin Diffusion" (on the legendary Cogumelo Records). The album featured guest vocals by Korg (from Chakal) on the track "TV Sucker". They released another full-length a year later titled "Nós Somos a América do Sul". This was a departure from their gritty debut and had a more crossover punk style. They split up sometime thereafter. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Psychic+Possessor">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
