Eventual Fate is a four piece band from the Midlands, creating a unique blend of modern day melodic metal.  Eventual Fate has studied the art of Metal and has found a means of creating a hard hitting take on the genre.

Vocalist Ria Naden, is the bands front-woman providing piercing vocals that complement the songs passion and energy.   Guitarist Steve Upperton, the bands visionary, provides modern tones, haunting new metal riffs and demonstrates his technical wizardry with outstanding guitar solos.  Drummer Paul Hadwin mixes a blend of Zeppelin esquire drums, along with Bass Leisl Heath who performs crisp, clear, hard driven bass lines; together building a solid foundation for the songs.

Review quotes include, “The songs themselves aren’t written for radio intentionally, but by their very nature, these are instantly memorable compositions, and if you don’t find yourself singing the lyrics, you’ll find yourself humming the music almost instantly after the first listen.”  “Lyrically supreme and the music is some of the best we have heard in a long time.”

Having achieved success previously as a five piece, Eventual Fate have had songs like, “Just to be with you” and “The Preacher” featured on various radio stations including TBFM and Moorlands Radio (who championed the band as one of the greatest they had ever had on their radio), as well as playing gigs between Nottingham and Manchester with a view to extending tour dates over the next year.   With the release of Promised Land, their new album, 2015 will be the year that establishes Eventual Fate as a main competitor on the live music circuit. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Eventual+Fate">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
