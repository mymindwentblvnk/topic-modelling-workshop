Evil encarnated. Born from a novice who had body and soul raped, the Devil’s son arrives to human race with the determination and lust for vengeance inherited from his father. Making of his biological mother his first victim on a corrosive birth, the saga of Evil’s child begins in 2010.

Killrape was formed in 1993 by the brothers Nilmon Filho (guitars) and Rodson Lemos (bass and vocals), in Rio de Janeiro. In the beginning, just named “Corrosive”, Killrape songs have been shaped through the years. The debut album, “Corrosive Birth”, features songs done since the early years until now, gathering aggression and massive destructive melodies. Its current line up, with André “Havok” on drums, shows the style which mixes Thrash and Death Metal adds more identity and technique. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Killrape">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
