There are two bands with this name:

1. A black metal band from Greece with lyrical themes involving the litirature of J.R.R. Tolkien , mythology, and miscellaneous fantasy.
All of their albums are available for a free download on their official website.

2.  A keyboard/percussions duo from Ivrea (Italy) featuring flowing sounds gliding from ambient to tribal rhythms. Long tracks with sound masses moving in layers with a wise care of the instrumental dynamics. A strange mix in which can be found echoes from Brian Eno, Peter Gabriel, minimalism and refined post-rock. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dol+Amroth">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
