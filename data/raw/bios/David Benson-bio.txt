David Benson's music can be best described as doom metal influenced primarily by Ozzy-era Black Sabbath.  His mission is to banish the darkness, through cutting hard hitting lyrics and edgy melodies of Doom!  David's desire is spread the light and dispel the darkness through Christ!  David is best known for his signature vocal style, compared to that of Ozzy Osbourne - coupled with his hard driving doom oriented hard rock. Starting his solo career from South-Carolina USA, the title song of the Debut Album HOLY PSYCHOTHERAPY entered Toplists and RADIO CHARTS all over the US! 


"Two studio recordings I heard truly do evoke the Oz-man. 'Bout time someone did it proper!"
Lonn Friend, Rip Magazine and Author

"Sounds like a good mix of Old School Doom inspired by Black Sabbath with a mix of modern influence and heavy stuff. The singer could be Ozzy's Brother!"
- Alexander Rack, President of Black Sabbath Fan Club, Germany

"If Ozzy ever needs a ghostsinger it should be David Benson"
