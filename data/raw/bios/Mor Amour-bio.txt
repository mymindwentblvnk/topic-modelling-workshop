Mor Amour is a post-indie rock project coming out of Brooklyn, New York.   The artist behind Mor Amour is Stephen Biebel, a singer and guitarist who decided to record and produce his own music in late 2006.  

Mor Amour's first EP entitled 'Stolen Are The Days' was released September 12th, 2007 by Forever Records, to many rave reviews for its originality and eloquent electronic layering.  Lack of distribution really limited the reach of the EP.  Three tracks from "Stolen Are The Days" were produced by Jeremy Johnson, an artist and musician making his name in the band Pitty Sing.  Johnson was the main producer of the songs "Before I Let You Down", "Not In My Bed", and "My Mistakes".  

After the EP, Stephen Biebel looked to reinvent himself, and immediately started recording his first full length album.  "My Armour" by Mor Amour is currently still being recorded.  A release date has not yet been announced, but some of the tracks have been released early due to impatience of the artist.  

The name Mor Amour was given to Stephen Biebel's music by Paul Holmes (Paul & The Patients, Pitty Sing), who is a lifelong friend, and major influence on Biebel's artistic development.  

Mor Amour is also the singer for the bi-coastal Shoegazer/Soul band Chemicolour.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mor+Amour">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
