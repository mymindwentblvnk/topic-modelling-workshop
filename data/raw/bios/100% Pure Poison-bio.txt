100% Pure Poison was comprised by a group of American millitary men stationed in Germany during the early 70s. Their pre-disco soul music was of notable quality with a Chicago or Detroit urban feel. Despite their quality, they never climbed to prominence in the United States. In Europe, however, their contributions live on more vividly. 

Most recently, the group's classic "Windy C" was sampled by French downtempo producer/artist St. Germain (Ludovic Navarre). Here, "Windy C's" steady groove is mixed with vocal and guitar samples from John Lee Hooker to form the track "Sure Thing". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/100%25+Pure+Poison">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
