TASTY SQRLS grew from the mountain soil of roots music and the sunshine of psychedelic rock. The SQRLS feature the offbeat and often socially conscious songs of Jack None, a postdoc at Caltech, who wrote a few songs specifically for the The PHD Movie. Based in Los Angeles, TASTY SQRLS play local bars and festivals.

SQRLS appearing on the soundtrack include postdocs, grad students, and undergrads. Jack None (vocals, guitars, mando), Sharon Kunde (vocals and flute), David Tam (cello), Jeremy Stacey (drums), and Michael Ferrara (drums). The songs were produced by Jack None and Joel Douek.

A TASTY SQRLS album is scheduled to be out in early 2012! Check out home-brewed music by physicists and English grad students working in harmony at http://www.tastysqrls.com/

More about Jack None

Jack None, the singer and composer of TASTY SQRLS, is a postdoc in Theoretical Astrophysics at Caltech, and his research is concerned with the observation and interpretation of gravitational waves using the LIGO interferometers.

The songs were specifically composed for the movie, and often punctuate the transitions between chapters thanks to witty songs with a nice and fun quirky aspect.
