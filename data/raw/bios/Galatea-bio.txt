Galatea

Is an electronic chilean trio formed in Mexico in 2006 after Director Shawn Garry asked Eduardo Caces to create the music for his debut film “Desierto sur” (winner of Best Music Award at Viña del Mar Movie Festival)

Formed as a conceptual project, they consisted of Eduardo Caces (Lucybell´s bassist) Teresita Cabeza (lead vocals) and Jorge Gaete (keyboard and sequences).

Their first single “Caminos” got media attention and the band started to perform in alternative clubs in Mexico and Chile.

Galatea perfectly mixes influences from rock, trip hop, and electronic resulting in an organic way that becomes the perfect blend for chill out.
