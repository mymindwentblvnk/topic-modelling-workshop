Black Crucifixion is a black metal band from Rovaniemi, Finland, formed in 1991 by Forn (vocals) and Blacksoul (guitar), with Beherit members Sodomatic Slaughter (drums) and Arjo Wennström (bass) joining them.

Called Horned Lord in their early weeks of existence, the band debuted on August 23rd 1991 at the metal festival Day of Darkness in Oulu, alongside Sentenced, Impaled Nazarene, Demigod, Amorphis, Belial and Beherit. 

Holocausto Vengeance of Beherit provided input on the December 1991 recording sessions for Black Crucifixion’s debut demo The Fallen One of Flames in his role as co-producer. The Fallen One of Flames was released as a limited 250-copy edition tape by Fallen Pages Productions, publishers of the zine Fallen Pages.

After The Fallen One of Flames, Black Crucifixion began working on their debut release for Austrian Lethal Records. New member E.Henrik (bass) was responsible for some of the song writing and the band’s sound progressed, with the EP Promethean Gift released in July 1993.

It would be over a decade before another release, 2006's Faustian Dream, which was followed by a live album in 2009, and then a comparative burst of productivity with the full lengths Hope of Retaliation in 2011 and Coronation of King Darkness in 2013.

The original Black Crucifixion logo was designed by Taneli Jarva, who also created logos for Sentenced, Impaled Nazarene, Black League and Beherit; and played in the first three bands. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Black+Crucifixion">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
