Formed several Years ago Blinded released 2 full length albums and toured extensively across Canada.
After taking a break we relocated to Kelowna and added a fifth member, and new Singer Andrew Avril. With the new line-up change we progressed from a Skatepunk style to a more original Modern Alternative Rock style.

We no longer tour but have slowly produced and released some new work including a heartwarming narrated christmas story called Santa's Note (www.santasnote.ca)

We've recorded several new songs at Flying Monkey Studios with the Great Travis Saunders. 

All of our songs, news and information about us can be found on our website, www.blindedcanada.com. Hope you like the new tunes, hope to see y'all soon!
