About
Echoes of a Nightmare formed in Early 2010 with one thing in mind, to make noise in the metal word one riff at a time. Hailing from Miami, Florida, the band has its sights set on making its mark in the South Florida metal scene with eyes to the national stage. The band consists of guitarist David Briceno,lead guitarist Kris Vasquez, bassist Miguel Armas, and vocalist Helena Suba. The band is currently working on mixing/mastering the debut EP "Ashes of Remembrance" that mixes everything from Melodic Death Metal, Metalcore, Hardcore and Death Metal.

Armed with furious riffs, slashing leads, devastating low end, powerful drumming and ferocious vocals, Echoes of a Nightmare is ready to show just how brutal a band with metalcore roots can be. EoaN has been compared to great bands like Unearth, As I Lay Dying, The Black Dahlia Murder, bands who are the best at mixing catchy melodies and aggressive riffs. In time people will see how these individuals can rise above being normal people and turn into something worthy of legend. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Echoes+Of+A+Nightmare">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
