GORYPTIC is born in September 2005. Just after its creation, GORYPTIC released a 2 tracks promo CD which got really good feedbacks. Thus the band focused on writing new stuff for its first full length scheduled for the beginning of 2007 while playing live.

In 2007, GORYPTIC released its first full length entitled "From Blast To Collapse" which got excellent feedbacks. GORYPTIC headlined two tours: the first one in Europe (Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Slovakia, Hungary, Ukraine...) during summer with Eternal Bleeding, features on great festivals (Brutal Assault, Mountains of Death, Sziget Fest, Red Alert Open Air) and shared the stage with bands like Dying Fetus, Immolation, Suffocation, Gorgasm, Vader, Deicide and many more; the second one in November, in France, Spain and Portugal with another French band called Infest.

In 2008, GORYPTIC parted with its bassist and welcomed Trash (ex HxCxF) as new bass player. Thus GORYPTIC can focus on the writing of a new full length which should be released in 2009 <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Goryptic">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
