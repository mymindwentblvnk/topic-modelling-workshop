4) Lycanthrope is a metal band located on the Central Coast in NSW, Australia. Founded in 2011 by guitarist Aidan Lee and vocalist Dan Greig, the band played countless local shows before heading into the studio to record a three track demo, which had success on the Triple J Metal Charts with the opening track "Paths Divided" getting into the top 20. Following the successful release of the demo within the local scene, the band headed back into the studio in 2012 to record their follow up EP "Limitless" which further increased the bands popularity, with their track "The Golden Mile" featuring on the Triple J Metal Charts at #4 and still continues to get played on Triple J Digital Radio. The band followed up their release of "Limitless" with a string of high profile shows supporting bands such as I Killed the Prom Queen, Northlane, Make Them Suffer, Aversions Crown, Chariot, and Silverstein.

In Late 2013, the band lost three of its members and after months of re-structuring the foundations of the band, the current line up of Aidan Lee, Dan Greig, Brett Scott, Jason Salvini, Scott Wright, and Matthew Stoja was put into place. With new blood within the band, Lycanthrope spent 2014 transforming their sound and writing metal music that is full of energy and purpose, fused with melodies, heavy breakdowns, and punchy rhythms.

Lycanthrope entered Spinlight Studio in July 2015 and worked with Rhys Zacher on their upcoming EP - "Revival" which is due for release in August 2015.
