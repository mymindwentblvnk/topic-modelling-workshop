Heimia was founded and put together in Oulu, 2004 by Ticu Korhonen on vocals, Teemu Aakko on guitars, Petri Henell on bass and Jussi Kaukonen on drums. The first recorded material was a self-titled 4-tracker in 2004. The latest recording -being the one you hold in your hands, called "Hell Yeah!" in 2006. With "Hell Yeah!" the band has accomplished further on refining their Crushing Rough Rock sound which has a Metal Edge but still is Melodic.

The band felt it needed a second guitar to thicken the sound barrage, and in late 2006 the doomiest dude in Oulu - Petri Saarela, was asked to join the group. In March 2007, the band decided to ask the drummer Jussi Kaukonen to step aside. Local doomin' fuzzin' stoner rockin' band "Dieselbunny" had just recently split-up and seasoned drummer Teemu Hautaniemi was without a job, so he was asked to join. The creative spirit and motivation within HEIMIA proceeded now to climb up and everyone's now concentrated on getting the band going further! 

However...

In May 2008 Teemu Hautaniemi and Petri Saarela decided to leave the band. And soon after that, bassist Petri Henell gave up with the band too. A new drummer is named Jake Pistokoski, and the bassist is named Kai Kauranen. The story ain..t over just yet.
