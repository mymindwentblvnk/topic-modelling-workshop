Diabolical Masquerade was an avant-garde/atmospheric black metal solo project of Anders Nyström (aka Blakkheim), guitarist for Katatonia and Bloodbath, origins from Stockholm, Sweden. Nyström wanted to have a band where he could compose more extreme music while Katatonia were exploring more mellow themes and moods.

All of the music on the first two albums were written and performed by Nyström, with guest vocal appearances from longtime collaborator Dan Swanö.  Swanö later became an integral part of the project, as co-writer and co-arranger, performer, engineer, mixer and producer on the 'Nightwork' and especially 'Death's Design' albums.

Diabolical Masquerade has released four full length albums: Ravendusk In My Heart (1996), The Phantom Lodge (1997), Nightwork (1998) and Death's Design (2001).

Since long journey from 1993, Diabolical Masquerade was laid to rest in September of 2004. But recently Anders Nyström stated that he is working on a new Diabolical Masquerade album and he is also looking for more members for live performances.
