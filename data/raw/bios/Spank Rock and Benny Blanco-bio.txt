Spank Rock and Benny Blanco do their best 2 Live Crew impression here throwing down raunchy sex rhymes over five booty-shakin' neo-Miami Bass cuts. The production style and high-energy rhymes are generic enough to make well-informed listeners scratch their heads and wonder whether this EP is homage or lampoon. Producer Benny Blanco even goes so far as to utilize a few samples straight from 2 Live's tracks. Amanda Blank, Santogold, and Illvia make guest appearances. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Spank+Rock+and+Benny+Blanco">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
