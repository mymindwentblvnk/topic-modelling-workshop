The project Drawing Voices attempts to expose the nervous system through audio, video and meta-technologies. It was founded by Craig Dongoski in 1999. The underlying aim is to use technology to exploit the hidden sound of mark-making.  This CD includes sounds from various Drawing Voices sessions used in collaboration with musician/artist Aaron Turner (ISIS). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Drawing+Voices">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
