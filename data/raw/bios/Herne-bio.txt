There is more than one artist with this name:

1) Herne (finnish for Pea) is a musical enthusiast and explorer that aims to fill in the imaginary gap between DJing and producing by not doing either of them. His live sets are track selection based journeys through a huge variety of genre-obsolete sounds without settling on any particular one. He uses the songs as producers do samples to build what he considers to be "a several hours long track based on a theme" filled with surprising mash-ups and tracks one might not hear anywhere else. 

Back in 2010 he started and is currently in charge of Origami Sound - a collective of both producers and labels from all over the world focusing on the highly subjective concept of emotional electronic music with an emphasis on eclecticism. 

2) HERNE is a pagan metal project inpired by the landscapes and folk tales of the British and Germanic lands.

The project was started by Morten of Eldborg / Thulr and Sceot Acwealde of Brewaldas / Symbel.

The duo have recorded an album's worth of studio material ( live drums, distorted and acoustic guitars, keyboards, clean and harsh singing ) that awaits final vocals and arrangements.

Herne is scheduled for a release in the late Autumn 2009. 

3) Herne is polish band founded in 1997 in Bialystok, playing folk inspired celtic music and Middle Ages.
