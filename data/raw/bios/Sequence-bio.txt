Sequence is a name of at least four bands:

1) A defunct female old school hip-hop trio, best known as The Sequence, who signed to Sugar Hill in the early-1980s. The group consisted of Cheryl Cook (Cheryl The Pearl), Gwendolyn Chisolm (Blondie), and lead singer/rapper Angie Brown Stone (Angie B.). The group originated from Columbia, South Carolina as a group of high school cheerleaders.

Releases, under this name, included singles "And You Know That" (1980, Sugar Hill) and "Simon Says" (1982, Sugar Hill), plus Here Comes The Bride (1999 re-release of 1983 original, Rhino Entertainment, on v/a "The Sugar Hill Records Story").

Their most notable single was "Funk You Up" (1979), which was the first rap record released by a female group and the second single released by Sugar Hill Records. Elements of "Funk You Up" were later used by Dr. Dre for his 1995 single "Keep Their Heads Ringin'".

The group backed Spoonie Gee on the single "Monster Jam" (1980).[1] Their single "Funky Sound (Tear the Roof Off)" (1981) was a remake of the single "Give Up the Funk (Tear the Roof off the Sucker)" (1976) by Parliament. The groups other charting single was "I Don't Need Your Love (Part One)" (1982). Angie Stone subsequently became a member of Vertical Hold and later a solo artist.
