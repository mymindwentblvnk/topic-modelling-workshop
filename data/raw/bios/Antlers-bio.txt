There are five bands with the name Antlers, none of which should be confused with the band The Antlers, best known for their 2009 album, Hospice.

1)Antlers are comprised of a group of Richmond/DC musicians from bands such as Mass Movement of the Moth, Gregor Samsa, Resonance, and Olive Tree. The band plays melodic primarily instrumental mathy tunes that might remind you of bands like Don Cab, Ghost and Vodka, and June of 44.

2)A punk/grind band from seattle, Washington. Planned to release a split 10" with YCAD. Only did one tour but got a lot of attention sadly broke up after.

3)Antlers is a band from Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Line-up consist of: Julius, Jonah, Yannick and Daan. They rock the coolest city on the planet with their experimental metal.

4) Short-lived drunken party-prog trio ANTLERS played their only show at Liverpool's Korova venue on the 29/01/08 when supporting The Mae-Shi. Existing for only six rehearsals and one performance, they broke up only to reform a week later under the name BUMS. The band plan to break up and reform under a new name (beginning with the next letter of the alphabet) once they have performed their new work. In real life its members belong to Hot Club de Paris and goFASTER>>. They will roach your fucking homework.

5) A black metal project from Leipzig, Germany. Members of Ekkaia, Cop on fire team up for some melodic black metal. A Gaze Into The Abyss LP out in 2015, Beneath.Below.Behold in 2018.
