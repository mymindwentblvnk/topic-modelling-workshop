The Music of AYIN ALEPH is at the confluence of very different horizons: rock and metal but also some classical influences like the baroque and romantic music. The components are weaved in such a personal manner, that the polyphonic music of AYIN ALEPH can not properly refer to lyrical metal or symphonic rock as existing. Her music offers to these genres a real musical hybridization. Her lyrics are very poetical and somehow at the frontier between theology and symbolism. « « It seems that through AYIN ALEPH it is a certain Freddie Mercury that is reincarnated in a female version » (Jacques de Pierpont – Classic 21 RTBF – Bruxelles)  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ayin+Aleph">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
