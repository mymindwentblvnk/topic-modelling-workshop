Carnal Creation is a Finnish Death/Black/Grind Metal band from the Helsinki/Espoo area. The band was formed in spring 2005 and soon their first EP Yet External Exploration was out. It was a self released 5-song EP, which received positive feed back - a demo of the month in the Finnish metal magazine Inferno to name some. After some gigs Carnal Creation recorded a promotional demo to promote their debut album. Promo 06, released in the beginning of 2006, had 4 songs, including a cover from Anaal Nathrakh as the fourth bonus song.

In the beginning of 2007 Panu Posti decided to quit on the drums. Currently the band is looking for a new Drummer!
