There are four known bands (at least) called Lord Byron.  

1: A Dallas/Denver rapper who has released two projects so far: The Pre-Mixtape Mixtape
 and Dark Arts Vol. 1.

2: A Brazilian power metal band who have released two albums.

3:  A cabaret/glam/progressive rock band, formed in Australia, currently resident in London, England:

Lord Byron formed in Brisbane, Australia, in late 2005 originally as an art project.  As a song writing collaboration, Lord Byron is singer Kevin Zwierzchaczewski and keyboardist Robert Russell, who draw their influences most heavily from David Bowie, Queen and the Baroque music of the 17th Century. As a glam rock band, calling upon all the finest traditions of Ziggy Startdust, Roxy Music and T-Rex, Lord Byron has sounds ranging from cabaret to classical, from vaudeville to rock. Lord Byron was fully realised with the inclusion of Elspeth Johnson on lead guitar, Ben Hutton on drums and Jacob Meyjes-Brown on bass. 

2007 saw the release of Lord Byron’s “Marionette” EP, a showcase of the band’s musical diversity, recorded, mixed and mastered at Brisbane’s FireFish Studios. A music video shortly followed, which was nominated for 2 awards in the Australian Independent Film Makers’ Awards.

Early 2008 saw Lord Byron return to the studio to record the album “Dancing on the Moon”.  Shortly after finishing the mixes, the band decamped to the UK in search of a wider niche, and the final master of the record was completed in England.  "Dancing on the Moon"  was independently released in the UK in July 2008. 

4:  A German heavy metal band, with one album, Fly Free, released in 2000. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lord+Byron">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
