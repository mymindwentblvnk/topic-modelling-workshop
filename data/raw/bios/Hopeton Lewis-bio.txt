Hopeton Lewis is a Jamaican singer.

Lewis began recording in the mid-1960s, and had one of the earliest rocksteady hits with "Take It Easy" in late 1966. He had several more Jamaican hits in the late 1960s and early 1970s, including the first 'herb' song ever recorded in Jamaica, "Cool Collie", worked for Duke Reid as an arranger and backing singer, and won the Festival Song Contest in 1970 with "Boom Shaka Lacka". He began working as a singer with Byron Lee & the Dragonaires, and in 1971 had a hit with "Grooving Out On Life". He continued to release records, but his success after the early 1970s was limited.

Since the late 1990s, Lewis has re-emerged as a Gospel singer. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hopeton+Lewis">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
