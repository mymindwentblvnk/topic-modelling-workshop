Thomas Hansen (a.k.a Saint Thomas, formerly St. Thomas) (February 13, 1976 - September 5, 2007) was an alt-country musician from Norway. After quitting his job as a mailman to concentrate on his music, he was signed to Norwegian label Racing Junior. His breakthrough album, I'm Coming Home, was both a critical and commercial success when released in Norway and internationally.

He subsequently released albums for a number of labels, including: Racing Junior, City Slang, Misra Records, Track & Field, and Make My Day Records.

In August 2006, Saint Thomas released a new album, officially his sixth, There's Only One of Me, on his own label, Cornerman Records. The album was also licensed to Make My Day Records for release in Germany, Austria & Switzerland and to yesboyicecream records for release in the UK and Ireland.

On the 10th of September 2007, Hansen was found dead in his home. Coroner's exams determined that he had died 5 days earlier of what was described as "an unfortunate combination of prescribed drugs". He was 31 years old.
