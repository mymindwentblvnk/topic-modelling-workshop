CRIOGENIA was born in Santiago of Chile in 2001, when Enrique Jara (Guitar Player and Composer), recorded with some other musicians a promotional song called: "The Best Way to Suicide", giving birth to the formula that would bring the musical definition to "Criogenia".
The great response of the media and general headbangers alike, Enrique and the other invited musicians got many shows in between 2001 and 2004. During that period, Enrique spend some time looking for the right line up for the band and get their first album recorded.
Then, bad administration problems and the posibility of breaking of the band apart, made Enrique separate him from the rest of the musicians and keep going himself as always has been.
Now days, CRIOGENIA is working on the recording of their second album, with new members that got their name consolidated on the Chilean Scene throught the years making possible even better level that Ciogenia had gotten before .
