Bound together with oozing soul and moody bass-lines, Isaac Tichauer’s productions splice together classic and contemporary house concepts. A classically trained pianist and heavily influenced by the Detroit house scene, Isaac orchestrates a deep progressive energy in his music through detailed synth work, melancholy vocals and classic lead elements from Rhodes to strings.

In July 2013, Isaac was signed to FRENCH EXPRESS (USA) and debuted with his critically acclaimed full length album, “Devotion”, a release that gave the world a captivating first glance at Isaac’s production muscle and lengthy infatuation with the genre. A compelling first effort for a person born completely deaf and now living with just one working ear.

Continuing his “exploration of classic sounds”, Isaac released his club hit “I Forgive You”, and more recently the “Take Over You” EP in May 2013 that saw Isaac’s compositions reach new heights, enjoying regular play on BBC Radio One and Triple J Australia.

Now residing in Berlin, Isaac works as a producer full-time, dedicating his time to a host of brand new productions and continuing his celebrated mixtape series. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Isaac+Tichauer">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
