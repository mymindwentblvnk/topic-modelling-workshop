"Hailing from a city that has produced some of hip-hops brightest stars, G.T Garza has emerged as Houston's next favorite son. Born in San Diego, California G.T. moved to Houston at the age of five. During middle school he began to rap. In his freshman year of high school he began to develop his own style and began battle rapping in various Bars and Clubs. Once he perfected his style, he took his chances at the 2002 Import Expo.

Catching the eye of Universal artist Rob G, he was recruited to G Style entertainment. G.T. was also recognized by the Houston radio group" The Choppaholix", who then recruited G.T. to represent the new era of hip-hop in Texas. With names such as "The Phenom", "The One Man Army", and "The Future", this young star is rapidly on the rise. His unmistakable flow and style even landed him a spot on an exclusive H-Town Remix of Ashanti's "Still on It" alongside Paul Wall, and the remix to Chris Brown's "Run It" which both hit heavy rotation on FM dials.

With many victories under his belt, including "Road to the Apollo" sponsored by Footaction/Adidas as well as "The Sunkist Sound lab" sponsored by Sunkist. G.T is no stranger to the grind. With his hard work and dedication he has made his name well known in the Houston area by appearing on shows, such as the Choppaholix xm radio show, Texas FM radio shows and many mixtape features. His first major mixtape release " Maverick Music" earned him the respect of his peers and his fans.

From the streets to the booth GT Garza is truly next in line to rise from the south."
