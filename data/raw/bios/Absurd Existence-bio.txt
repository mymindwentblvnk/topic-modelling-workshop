Absurd Existence is a German death-doom metal band that formed in 1992 in Essenbach, Bavaria. After a self-released demo 'Silence' (1993) the band were picked up by Force Music to record their sole full-length in 1994, entitled 'Angelwings'. Shortly afterwards the band name was changed to Croon.

Their playing style is often reminiscent of Serenades-era Anathema, with mostly harsh vocals and heavy melodic riffing offset occasionally by quiet acoustic passages. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Absurd+Existence">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
