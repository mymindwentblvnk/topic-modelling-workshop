The band was established in May 2005 by Molester. The first tunes were on a melodic black death path.

           The firts rehearsals gave birth to Loudrage's first tracks, followed by the first gig, an open-air at the Filarmonia Fest in Ludus City, our home-town, on 29.07.2005 together with: Seven, Slang, Dispersia, Autograf, Else, Intercity. The band is scheduled to play at the end of the show, and because of the time, the Police stops Loudrage's show after only 4 tracks for sound brutality.
           Next is a period of expectation when nothiong happens, but the band returns in May 2006, with new tracks and a new style called groovy death metal with strong hardcore and grindcore influences. That period marked the serious birth of Loudrage, a new beginning. The line-up remained unchanged.
