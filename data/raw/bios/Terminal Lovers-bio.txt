Hailing from the rusty shores of Cleveland Ohio, Terminal Lovers has been delivering metallic psych k.o., freak & roll groove, fried drones & immediately haunted songs since 2000. What's being channeled falls somewhere within the combined sound of Amon Duul 2, Blue Oyster Cult & This Heat. Navigated by Dave Cintron (Dimbulb, Downside Special, Scarcity of Tanks, Speaker/Cranker),  the stellar line-up is filled out by Chris Smith (Keelhaul, Integrity), Jamie Walters (Boulder, Midnight), Bob Zeiger (Midnight, Darvocets) and Brent Gemmill (of New Zealand's classic early 90's thud monsters, Lung).

"... heavy, rocking and straight out of left field. Terminal Lovers fuse kraut, dub, improv, drone, and pop influences to create a sound that is dense, diverse, and difficult to pin down, yet it all feels fluid and effortless."
- Public Guilt

 "... a constantly shifting sonic landscape that incorporates elements of punk, metal, psych rock, Krautrock, alien soundtracks, pop, drone, and pure unalloyed weirdness. The heavy psych vibe is the cosmic cornerstone from which all these other sounds radiate... rooted in a genre of music whose practictioners tend to get lost in their own nebulous clockwork, this is supremely focused and consistently high (in more than one sense) in quality... acid-rock"

"True Heads with One Eye fixed on the lunations of the heavens...after the deep art-rock invention of Terminal Lovers, most of the so-called stoner rock gathering in their masses is just so much novelty compost."
