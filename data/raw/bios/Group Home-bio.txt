Group Home is a Hip Hop duo, consisting of members Lil' Dap and Melachi the Nutcracker. They came to prominence as members of the Gang Starr Foundation, along with Gang Starr members DJ Premier & Guru, and MC's Afu Ra, Bahamadia, Big Shug and Jeru The Damaja. Lil' Dap made his rhyming debut on Gang Starr's 1992 classic Daily Operation, on the song "I'm The Man". Both members appeared on Gang Starr's critically acclaimed 1994 effort Hard to Earn, on the tracks "Speak Ya Clout" and "Words From The Nutcracker". In 1995, they dropped their debut album Livin' Proof. The album was very well received, mainly due to DJ Premier's advanced production work. The duo released their sophomore album "A Tear For The Ghetto" in 1999. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Group+Home">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
