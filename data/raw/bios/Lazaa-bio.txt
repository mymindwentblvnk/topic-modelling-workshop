Formed when Taxx met Herensugue in France. Later the band turned into a 3-piece and ended up scattered across 3 cities in different countries - Herensugue in San Sebastiбn, Spain; Taxx in Bandung, Indonesia; and Aludira in Chambйry, France. Due to the difficulties with the band being this scattered, Aludira and Herensugue left. Currently, the band is stationed in Indonesia with Taxx being the only member.
