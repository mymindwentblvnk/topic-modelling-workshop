Tex Williams (23rd August 1917-11th October 1985) was an American country musician from Ramsey, Illinois. He helped move rural and acoustic country music to dance-oriented mainstream pop Western swing. His popularity peaked in the late 1940s. Williams is perhaps best-known for this talking blues style; his biggest hit, the novelty song "Smoke! Smoke! Smoke! (That Cigarette)" appears in the hit film Thank You for Smoking. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tex+Williams">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
