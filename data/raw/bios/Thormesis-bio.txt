Thormesis are probably one of the most promising young Pagan / Viking Metal bands from the German underground. With their second album "Past ashes" (Spring 2010), this crazy horde presents dynamically and independently. Anthemic, rousing clear vocals combined with the fury and rage of a trapped wolf. A rough diamond in a very crowded music scene!
This lineup began to root out the end of 2007 with the recordings of the debut album "Go and fight."

The Silberling was in the box and met the expectations of the band. To those present, however Thormesis played in January 2008, the release concert on the Pagana I in the tithe barn of stone box. Young bands like Thy Wicked, shadow realm, Thy Thormesis One and even gave himself the honor.

Yet in 2008 one could deny some battles in the local area. Among other things, on the Torn Your Ties - Open Air (Membaris, Immortal Remains, Torture and Vargsheim), the Black / Pagan Nights in Gro√üerlach (Thy Wicked, Legio Mortis and Membaris) and on 25 10th 2008 Iron Fist Part I took place in Aalen (Thy Wicked, Pirates of Acheron, Curruptio, Tankfucker and Dark Soul).
In the winter of 2008 Thormesis played together with Ahnengrab and other bands on the Fucking Christmas tour. The second Pagana the beginning of the year 2009 was celebrated with Black Messiah, Thy Wicked, and Thormesis Hropatyr. Further Thormesis gave up the battle in the Saarland with JBO Walpurgis, the apocalyptic horsemen, Fiddlers Green, Cromdale, her sound works for the best.
