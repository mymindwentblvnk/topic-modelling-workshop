Founded by Drahcir, Phenex and Ynzir in mid 2011. Dood is the Dutch word for “death” and speaks for itself. A first album was written during one year of existence, Dood created the album “Luciferian Manifest”which is full of raw, old-school and psycho Black Metal. The first album will be released through “Zwaertgevegt label”, a Dutch underground label.
