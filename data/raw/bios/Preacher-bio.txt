"Preacher" is an exercise in the concept of 'Music as Art' using a largely electronic aural paintbrush, and meshing it with visual concepts. As time progresses and evolves so will the project.  In its current formation it calls itself Anti-dance Industrial. However, the influence and structure of the sound is largely based in [heavy] metal roots; with instrumental and structural experimentation remaining a huge factor in its creation and continuation. The lyrical themes are generally dark, angry, and honest, drawing from a large range of subject matter. The name "Preacher" and Imagery are based upon religious icons and symbolism, although the band is in no way affiliated with any organized religion and does not support the spreading of mental disease and/or naivety.
