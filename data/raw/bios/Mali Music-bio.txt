Jamaal "Mali Music" Pollard was born on January 12, 1988 in Phoenix, AZ.  The Savannah based singer, songwriter, producer is breaking out of conventional gospel music.  Mali Music began playing piano at age 5 and wrote his first song at age 8 and has been actively pursuing his music ministry and career ever since adding acoustic guitar and electric bass to his instrumental proficiency.  Mali Music’s love for music is largely influenced by legendary artist Sam Cooke and Otis Redding.  Mali Music’s sound is heavily inspired by the work of music geniuses Bilal and D’Angelo…free, boundless and uninhibited. 

 Mali Music serves as Minister of Music at Faith on the Move Ministries and though he remains unrestricted as a musician and artist, his passion lies in creating powerful, effective Christian lifestyle music that crosses genres and seeps to the core of people.
