Pagan-metal project ARIDNYK was founded in 2014 in Ukraine and represents creativity filled with Carpathian Hutsul shamanism and Slavic paganism.

The name of the project is taken from Ukrainian Hutsul mythology, where "Ardnyk" is the main god of the Carpathians, the supreme spirit of the Underworld, as well as the Creator of Mountains and Fire. The etymology of this name has not yet been fully investigated by scientists, but there are versions that it comes from the Latin "aridus", which is based on the sanskrit root "ari" - fiery.

The main artistic idea of the album "In the Reverie of the Ancient Mountains" is a look from the past, a look from the height of the eternal Carpathian Mountains to their Motherland, to native Ukraine. Wondering about her difficult fate, the authors plunge into the heroic era of their ancestors and turn to Heroes and Gods, receive initiation from them in order to preserve and awaken their kind.

In general, ARIDNYK's music is imbued with the spirit of the Ukrainian Carpathians, folklore plots and elements. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/ARIDNYK">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
