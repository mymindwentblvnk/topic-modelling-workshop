Valgud is a symphonic black metal band from The Rio Grande Valley (South Texas).  They've been around since 2006 and have since never failed to produce highly original symphonic black metal.

Primary inspirations for their music include Dimmu Borgir, Kamelot, Cradle of Filth, and Epic Choral, with many others too numerous to name.  

Currently they're unsigned and have been doing shows in South Texas and as far up as Houston, TX for years.  They've cultured quite a fan base and since they're first show in 2007 they have never disappointed.  The carefully crafted pieces of music draw the crowd in close to the stage no matter what genre they're into. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Valgud">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
