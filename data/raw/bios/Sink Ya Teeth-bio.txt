Sink Ya Teeth are an English Post-Punk Dance Infused duo formed in 2015. 

The band features multi instrumentalist and lead singer Maria Uzor and bassist Gemma Cullingford who write, record and produce all of their music themselves from their Norwich homes.

Uzor and Cullingford fuse 80’s and 90’s inspired rare groove and Electronic Dance Music with post-punk bass lines and ferocious vocals, with subject matters focusing on the human experience that everyone can relate to. 

Their debut single ‘If You See Me’ was described by Pitchfork as ‘…a melding of post punks like ESG and the Raincoats with the early machine patters of Chicago House’ and swiftly became Lamacq’s Livener for 6 consecutive days on BBC 6 Music. 

Both ‘If You See Me’ and the follow up single ‘Glass’ - a Georgio Moroder muscular dance track - hit the 6 Music Playlist.

Their self-titled debut album, released June 2018 on Hey Buffalo, won 6 Music's 'Album of the Day', and was championed by Steve Lamacq and BBC Introducing, who invited them to Maida Vale to record a session.

They released their second album, 'Two', on Hey Buffalo Records in February 2020. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sink+Ya+Teeth">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
