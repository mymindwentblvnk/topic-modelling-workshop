Multiple artists go by Pisces.

1. A late 60s psychedelic band from Rockford, Illinois. Recently rescued from obscurity by an album,   A Lovely Sight, released by the Numero Group label.

2. A short lived folk rock band fronted by Richard Digance. Released one album in 1971.

3. Israeli-born artist Moshik Kop who makes music under several monikers. As Pisces he released one self-titled CD (Pisces, 2001) on israeli MDMA label. It was later re-released by Christian Morgenstern's Forte Records under the title Way Above Below with the artist's moniker changed to Moshikop.

Pisces is a truly west-meets-middle east experience with Kop's downtempo rhythms intertwined with exotic-sounding vocals and live instrumentation operated by - among others - trumpeter Avishai Cohen.
