This is a 6-piece progressive dark metal band hailing, since the winter of 2003, from Shimla, at the Himalayas. 

Their music can best be defined as progressive-dark metal, a music genre truly unique in itself. their music is so different that no other band on the entire globe fits in this genre. A blitzkrieg on the drums, neanderthal growls and screams mixed with guttural grunts and pig squeals, mellow bass-lines, polyrhythmic riffing accompanied with melancholic, ambient melodies and surreal keyboard tones filling the entire spectrum. This is their sonic kaleidoscope.
