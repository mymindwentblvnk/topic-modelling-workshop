Fourth of July is a band of brothers who make lyrical, raucous Folk Rock about
the minefields of love, flyover country existentialism and the boozy social life of
their hometown of Lawrence, Kansas.
They’ve released two records on Range Life Records, 2010′s “Before Our Hearts
Explode!” and 2007′s “On The Plains”.
Their new LP, “Empty Moon” finds singer/songwriter Brendan Hangauer standing
on the precipice, looking back at the intense final throes of a long love affair and
forward, with an eagle eye, at the landscape of new beginnings. A record full of
headlong melodies, drunken hope and heartache and startling insights into self
and circumstance, “Empty Moon” is an exalted howl at the moon as the rest of the
world rushes by.
