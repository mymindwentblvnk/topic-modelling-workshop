MOON'DOC, fronted by erstwhile CHINA WHITE and LANZER vocalist Chris Bay, was the mid 90s vehicle showing off the talents of ex-ACCEPT, SINNER and VICTORY guitarist Hermann Frank. In between recording with his MOON'DOC project, Frank also appeared on the 1995 ECHOPARK album 'Pretty Lies'. Vocalist Chris Bay and bass player Ilker Ersin created the successful Melodic Speed Metal act FREEDOM CALL in collusion with former GAMMA RAY drummer Dan Zimmermann in 1998.

A new look MOON'DOC emerged in 2000 with Frank joined by vocalist Jurgen Wulfes, bassist Frank Haase, HUNGRY keyboard player Ossy Pfeiffer and SAXON and SINNER drummer Fritz Randow. The SAXON connection was strengthened when Hermann Frank was credited with mixing the 'Killing Ground' album released by the stalwart British veterans in 2001. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/MOON%27DOC">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
