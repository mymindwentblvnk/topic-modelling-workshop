LOOK SEE PROOF were brothers David and Lee Sells (lead vocals & bass / vocals & guitar respectively), Jason Slender (guitar) Jonny Harry (vocals & drums) and Jaime Randall (vocals and keys)

Tigertrap Records first stumbled across LOOK SEE PROOF in The Bedford Angel on a particularly drizzly May Friday evening and were blown away by their mod-tinged exuberance, their bold yet insanely catchy melodies and inspired 3-part harmonies. Following a pivotal gig at the London Wilmington a few weeks later and still reeling from the fact that NO OTHER LABELS HAD DISCOVERED THEM YET, the band were spirited away in June for some World Cup-avoiding sessions with up and coming producer James Lewis (Roland Shanks/ The Dead 60's/ Morning Runner).  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Look+See+Proof">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
