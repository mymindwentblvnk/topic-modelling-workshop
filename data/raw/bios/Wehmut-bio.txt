Wehmut is a depressive black metal band from Germany. It's only member is Till S. 
Till released a promo in 2007 which contained a demo version from the song Ableben. In 2008, his self-titled debut was released on CD (500 copies) and tape (77 handnumbered copies + patch). A vinyl edition was released one year later (limited to 200 copies with slightly changed artwork).
