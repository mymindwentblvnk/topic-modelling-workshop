Tank Buster Jack consists of five very, very experienced musicians. No spring chickens - as the saying goes - they've been around the block a few timesWhen asked about previous bands or projects or recordings, only evasive answers are forthcoming and vocalist - and mouthpiece - Mark Städtler shrugs and says: Who cares what we did before, or whether we played with Jack or Jill in the past. Good or bad, we didn't become rich or famous, and from now on we only care about Tank Buster Jack.

The five hooked up during a party at his house near Hamburg, Germany, sometime in April 2006. Alcohol flowed, conversations jelled, a roaring good time was had by all, and it was generally established that they pretty much all enjoyed the same type of music and artists. Even before playing one note of music together they had already decided to abandon whatever it is they were doing - or not doing - and form a band. 
In the weeks that followed the five-some camped out in a garden house, and basically wrote and rehearsed their debut album.

Now they needed a producer who savoured similar musical appetites. They contacted Herman Frank - he of Accept and Victory fame - who in recent years set up his own Arena 20 recording studio in Hannover, Germany, and whom they admired for his work with the likes of Saxon, Rose Tattoo, and Molly Hatchet. Herman liked what he heard, and ROCK 'N' ROLL NEVER DIES was produced, recorded and mixed.
