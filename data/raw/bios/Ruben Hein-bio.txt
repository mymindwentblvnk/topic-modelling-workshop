Born in 1982, singer and jazz pianist Ruben Hein grew up in a very musically gifted family, near the city of Nijmegen, The Netherlands. At the age of four he discovered the piano. By the time he was eight years old, he had his first classical lessons at the local music school. Already in this period of his life, Ruben was fascinated by musicians like Ray Charles, Randy Newman, Miles Davis, the Beach boys and the Beatles. Soon after his first classical lessons, Ruben started taking jazz lessons. In 2001 Ruben started to study jazz piano at the Conservatory of Amsterdam. In the summer of 2008 he finished his Masters degree at that same conservatory. He studied with Kris Goessens, Karel Boehlee, Hans Vroomans, Rob van Bavel, John Taylor , Kenny Werner a.o. He also participated in many masterclasses and got the chance to work with people like John Clayton and Justin DiCioccio. Nowadays Ruben works with several groups: Hans Teeuwen Zingt!, Pete Philly & Perquisite, Benjamin Herman Quartet and Renske Taminiau Amsterdam Jazz Orchestra. Ever since he was young, Ruben had a fascination with singing. This fascination took a professional step when he was working on a cruiseboat as a pianist and singer in the beginning of 2006. In February 2007 Ruben won the 2nd prize in the Dutch Jazz Vocal Competition. At the moment Ruben is working on his own repetoire and recording his first album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ruben+Hein">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
