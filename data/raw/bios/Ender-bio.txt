"Ender describe themselves as experimental drone rock - which means their palette is mainly comprised of layered slabs of overdriven guitar........the pair have the capacity not only to construct great caverns of noise but to deftly evoke mood and emotion with sustained tones in harmony and dissonance. The arrangement of pure tone, minus premeditated riffs or the focus of a voice allows a listener to be carried away on its waveforms. The music is corralled into four unnamed parts, perhaps heralding a seasonal life cycle." - NZ Musician Magazine
