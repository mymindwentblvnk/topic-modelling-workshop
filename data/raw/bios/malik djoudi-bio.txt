Back in the day, he used to sing in English in the underground groups Moon Pallas and Kim Tim. Born to Algerian and Vietnamese parents, Malik Djoudi made the switch back to his mother tongue. Strangely enough, there’s a good chance that he’s going to reach a larger audience by singing in French – even abroad! It’s best to just let yourself be carried away by his tracks that, despite minimal instrumentals, fill the space and send sensual imagery right to your mind.

With his first album Un released in 2017, Malik Djoudi made an impressive entrance into the world of French pop music.

Following Un, Malik’s second album Tempéraments was one of 2019’s most anticipated French albums. The new release fully meets the high expectations. Driven by succinct melodies and colorful harmonies, it reveals a search for perfectionism, resulting in daring electronic arrangements. The album also features the duet ‘À tes côtés’ with French pop hero Étienne Daho, with whom Malik Djoudi definitely shares musical affinities. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Malik+Djoudi">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
