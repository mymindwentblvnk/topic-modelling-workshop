Comprised of Matthew Houle (vocals), Elijah Balbach (bass), Simon Mahlberg (guitar), and Alex Narveson (drums), Venom Lord was a band based in Bemidji, MN that combined elements of death metal, black metal, rock and roll, and "about a hundred other genres" into their material.
They released the "The Breath of the Dying" EP in 2005, and recorded their sole full-length album "Return of the Wizards" in 2007 at Port Sound (*cough* freely downloadable *cough*). Later a music video was shot by Mike Bredon for their track Iron Crow.

On September 26, 2009, Venom Lord play their last show to a crowd of enthusiastic fans at a fundraiser at the Elks Lodge in Bemidji, MN, for the Blue Ox Cooperative, an organization attempting to gain funds to buy a practice-space, recording studio, and venue for the diverse Bemidji music scene.
