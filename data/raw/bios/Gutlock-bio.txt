Since establishment in autumn 2003 these 5 guys from baunatal (germany) did an awesome job: After a 1st place at a bandcontest in Eschwege (germany) a performance on the "OPEN FLAIR 2004" followed. And it's a real pleasure to listen to: The album is impressing with fat riffs, adorable melodies, grooving drums and punchy vocals. The lyrics of their songs characterize the band: Beneath typical metallyrics ("hate you") they sing about selfironic and funny things like a "Disinclination for brussels sprouts". The energy, this album reflects, is also present in their live-performances: Their stageperformance is very close to the edge of insanity and even makes the laziest head in the audience bang! All these things were reasons for inviting GUTLOCK to the "JOHN LENNON TALENT AWARD". GUTLOCK was under the top 24 bands from about 500 out of germany. This talent award brought GUTLOCK to the famous WACKEN OPEN AIR festival. 

"In Conclusion The Abstinence" is the first albums name of the german band GUTLOCK. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gutlock">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
