East Flatbush Project is the brainchild of Spencer Bellamy, who was originally a DJ for rap pioneer Howie Tee. The project was developed to feature local Brooklyn rappers, and the debut single, "Can't Hold It Back," was released in 1994. But it was the next single, "Tried by 12," that took the hip-hop community by storm, as well as the electronic world. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+East+Flatbush+Project">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
