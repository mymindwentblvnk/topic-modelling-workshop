Ketum was founded in 2002 by Ulas Gursoy and Taner Tarhan in Izmir-Turkey. Roots of band had came from their old death-hardcore and industrial bands called Autumn, Dogfight and Sterile Noiz Klan. Sterile Noiz Klan released their debut (and last) album 'Fix' from Hammer Music label after Taner's joining, with his electronic music influences brought a different taste whereas for some circumstances the SNK disbanded after a while.

The following years, Ula and Taner gathered and found KETUM - it is another tale that the band's name emerged from being secretive to a person not to be mentioned till to the release of their home-made demo cd 'Since Storm'. Due to the technical obstacles might have caused the demo's sound a bit dull and digitized but frankly, the demo cds freely distributed around 200 copies within turkey and did a satisfactory feedback from several listeners. In 2004, Bassist Bulent Cengiz (a.k.a Mental Vortex) and the Drummer llkan (a.k.a. Dogfight) joined the band. For the time being, Ketum's 2006 plans is to be involved and participated in several concerts and related activities.

Musically Ketum's NOISE is on the line of representing hardcore-crustcore meets deathmetal and grindcore.

In June 2006 Goksel joined as the new drummer and on August 2006 the new EP-demo 'Ceasefire Ethics' was released. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ketum">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
