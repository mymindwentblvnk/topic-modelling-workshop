Deantoni Parks (born November 2, 1977) is a new wave/avant-garde/experimental drummer, songwriter, film director, actor and record producer born in Newnan, Georgia. He is the founder, producer and drummer of the New York band, KUDU, and one-half of the writing duo, Dark Angels with producer and keyboardist Nick Kasper, also a member of KUDU. 
Parks is also currently a member of progressive rock band The Mars Volta & the Omar Rodriguez Lopez Group.

Deantoni was born and raised in Newnan. His family’s musical preferences leaned towards funk, Southern soul and gospel and with their full support he began playing drums at age 2. He was put in the national spotlight before the age of 5 as a result of his practice and performance with the Newnan High School band. Xernona Clayton from The Xernona Clayton Show broadcast on WAGA-TV in Atlanta interviewed him for a national broadcast segment that aired in 1982.
He later explored jazz as a teen with Delbert Felix and chose to enroll at Berklee College of Music, where study with Lenny Nelson and exposure to Photek, Squarepusher, and Hidden Agenda turned his focus to the mechanistic beats of electronic music.

Currently based in Brooklyn, New York City he is a vested partner in a developing audio/visual communications agency. In between writing and performances he has been participating as part-time faculty at Stanford Jazz Workshop, Berklee College of Music and NYC’s Drummers Collective.
Parks is also currently a member of progressive rock band The Mars Volta.
