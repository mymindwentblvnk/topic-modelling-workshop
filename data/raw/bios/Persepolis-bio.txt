Formed in Mid-2010, Persepolis, formed under the name Via Dolorosa, is an Black/Death/Doom Metal band from Columbus, Georgia. Founded by Lead Guitarist Garrett "Sofos" Padilla as a solo project earlier that year, he added Vocalist/Bassist Shane "Gestas" Craft (Thrill of a Gunfight) soon after, and the mayhem commenced. 

We are currently in the final stages of writing our debut demo/EP "Holy Hypocrisy", soon to record. Keep your ears open for demo recordings of 4 original tracks + 1 cover.
