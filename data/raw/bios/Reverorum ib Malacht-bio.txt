Reverorum ib Malacht is a Swedish dark ambient and black metal project centred around Karl Hieronymus Emil Lundin and Karl Axel Mikael MÃ¥rtensson, with several others. Their philosophical focus shifted drastically from anti-cosmic Satanism in their early years to Roman Catholic mysticism. Their 2014 album "De Mysteriis Dom Christi" was released in three versions, with a completely different track listing on each physical format.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Reverorum+ib+Malacht">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
