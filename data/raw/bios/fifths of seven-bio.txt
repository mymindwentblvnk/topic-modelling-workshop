Montreal-based Fifths Of Seven is a trio comprised of cellist Beckie Foon (A Silver Mt. Zion, Set Fire to Flames, Esmerine), mandolin-player Rachel Levine (Cakelk with Alexander St. Onge), and pianist Spencer Krug (Frog Eyes, Wolf Parade, Sunset Rubdown, Swan Lake). Spry From Bitter Anise Folds confirms the high degree of musicality of these artists -- representatives of the Montreal scene which gathered around the anti-capitalist Constellation label (Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Fly Pan Am, Polmo Polpo, Black Ox Orkestar) -- who love improvisation and experimentation as well as a live approach to music. Their debut album of pure beauty is centered around the unusual quality in tone of the instruments and the high development of simple melodies, which place Fifths of Seven somewhere between Erik Satie, folkloric Eastern European music and, of course, the Constellation "post-rock" galaxy.
