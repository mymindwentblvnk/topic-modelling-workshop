Fueled by anger at the present global state of affairs, these six individuals came together with one goal in mind: to create the soundtrack for the coming of days. Combining unrelenting drums and brutal guitars, laying in a bed of electronic discomfort, and laced with smart scathing vocals, SKREW has returned. Known for their jaw dropping live performances, and groundbreaking production both in North America, and Europe, SKREW is playing their ﬁrst live shows in a decade. With a new line up, this version of SKREW promises to be the strongest, most ferocious to date. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Skrew">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
