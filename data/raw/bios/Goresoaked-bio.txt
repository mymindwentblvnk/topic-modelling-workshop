Goresoaked is a brutal death metal band from Helsinki, Finland. They have released three demos so far.

Goresoaked started off as Konsta's solo prjocet late 2003 under the name of Bloodstained. Early -04 Konsta and Perttu started playing the songs together with Siiri. A few months later Pate joined the band to handle the vocal duties. 

The first demo was recorded April -04, and was called Genital Buchery. In the summer as their skills had developed they started look for a second guitarist, after checking out some candidates they didn't feel that anyone was suitable for the task and thus the guitarist's spot remained unfilled. 

In the winter of 2005 Goresoaked asked the guitarist from Thy Legacy, Pekka, to join the band. He agreed and after playing few shows and making new song material, Goresoaked recorded the second demo, entitled "Death Metal Ejaculation" in September -05. After that they changed their bassist to Yrjö Gävert. The third demo was releasen in 2007.
