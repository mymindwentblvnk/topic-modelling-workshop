US black/death metal band. Their demise led to the creation of Black Witchery. Irreverent was formed back in 1991, as their members wanted to play some Hellhammer and Bathory covers. They split up in 1996 and so Witchery was born, but some years later, in 1999, they changed their name to Black Witchery. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Irreverent">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
