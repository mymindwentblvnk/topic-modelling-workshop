A SICKNESS UNTO DEATH is a doom metal band from Bremen, Germany, consisting of 5 members:
Michael Maas (gui)
Tim Ziegeler (vocals)
Giordano Bruni (gui)
Marius Paschen (dru)
Michael Nowak (bas)

A Sickness Unto Death formed in the beginning of 2012 as a collaboration between Michael and Tim. Michael runs the small project studio "Refuge Studio" close to Bremen, and has been writing doomy and gloomy songs. Tim also hails from the German north and has been involved in several musical projects such as the doomy Visions of Moribund and the brutal Hasszorn. Tim immediately connected to Michael's material and began contributing his signature vocal lines and lyrics. Since then, the duo has continued writing songs which will culminate in the release of the album "despair". The album was finished in January 2013 and was released through TWS May 3rd 2013.

After the release the band evolved into a complete metal band and thus performed several live shows. In 2015, the band released their second album called "The Great Escape", that was again produced by Michael Maas and mastered by Jens Bogren at Fascination Street Studios, Sweden. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/A+Sickness+Unto+Death">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
