Conceived in 2008 by Tim Shaw, Fyrdsman blends romanticism, history and folklore under a black metal banner to create a sound that is uniquely its own; rich in the timeless spirituality of its homeland and ready to take the flag for English Black Metal.

Following a brief hiatus due to other commitments, the first EP ‘Forgotten Beneath The Soil’ was released, to critical acclaim, on underground label Mynydd Du Records.

With word reaching as far as the US and the EP receiving highly positive reviews across the board and the full-length 'Omen in the Sky' unleashed by Mordgrimm in Winter 2013, Fyrdsman is ready to establish itself as a substantial force in the growing UK Black Metal scene and further afield. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fyrdsman">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
