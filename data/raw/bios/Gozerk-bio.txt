Gorzerk is a Thrash / Death Metal band from a village from Gran Canaria, Spain in 2005, formed by brothers Joel and Tyko Westermarck (from Finland). After a few months Carlos Tarajano Oliva and Juan Calderin Aleman join the brothers to complete the line-up . After spending nearly a year rehearsing and composing, began to give concerts around the island with a good reaction from the public that has grown over the years.
They play a form of death/thrash that bends close to grindcore. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gozerk">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
