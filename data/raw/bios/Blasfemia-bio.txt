2.)BLASFEMIA:  Hardcore /metal band from POLAND.  

  In 2004 three friends from the neighbourhood - Kuma (vocal), Sivy (bass) and Mlody (drums) - realised that all of them were interested in hardcore music and culture. They got the idea to set up a band and then they started meeting in a garage to practice playing. When Jaco (guitar) joined the band, Kuma quit playing the guitar and focused on vocals. In summer 2006 bass player Sivy left the band and Hater took his place.

March 2007 Blasfemia entered the Chinook studio in Debica, where they recorded their demo "Inside Conflict". The demo consists of five songs that can be put into hardcore/metal genre. The last line-up changes took place 2008, when Kruger filled in for Hater. Currently the band plays Terror hardcore, looking for some gigs and working on their debiut album.
