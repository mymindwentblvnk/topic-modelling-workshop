Field Harmonics is the Midlands based electronic pop duo comprised of Bryony Williams and Robert Glover, who is also one half of ambient pop experimentalists epic45 and co-founder of the Wayside and Woodland record label. Taking musical influence from 80s synth-pop and electronica, their music is an astonishingly effective blend of pulsing electronic pop and dreamlike ambience.
