Tommy Tutone is a new wave/power pop band, best known for the 80s rock hit "867-5309/Jenny" (also known by other names such as "867-5309"). The band is often called a typical example of a "one-hit wonder", since their other tracks never had the same chart success (although they received much airplay). Other songs include "Angel Say No" (which hit #38 on the Billboard Hot 40) and "Teen Angel Eyes" (part of the soundtrack to 'The Last American Virgin'). The group disbanded in the mid-80s after a brief run of success but returned in the mid-90s.

A common misconception is that Tommy Tutone is the name or nickname of the lead singer. It is actually the name of the band. The lead singer's name is Tommy Heath. The name of the band developed from the original name "Tommy and the Tu-tones" (a reference to classic doo-wop groups) to merely "Tommy Tutone". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tommy+Tutone">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
