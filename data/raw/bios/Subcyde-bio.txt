THE PAST:
The band was formed in late 1997 when Ola and Johan, who where playing in a local punk band wanted to break some necks and create absolute heavy metal mayhem, so they asked Martin (who was a big fan of several rock/metal bands and actually played guitar) if he wanted to fill in the bass spot in their new band. Antonio (who had recently moved to Sweden) was a metal filled the vocals spot. Jim was asked to join the band as second guitarist around the year 2000 and after a couple of years quit due to personal reasons.
