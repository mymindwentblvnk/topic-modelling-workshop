PSYCHOPARADOX is Melodic Death Metal band formed in Smederevo in 1993. First line up consisted: Marko Vukašinović, Miroslav Branković, Marko Jugović and Ivan Cvetković. 

After a few months, Marko fell sick of leukemia, and he left the band. Miroslav took of the vocals, until 1995. when he invited his 15 year old brother Srđan Branković to be the vocalist for the upcoming album. First album entitled ''...And Your Life is Just Another Dream'' is recorded in 1995. and released in 300 tape copies, and was influenced by Bolt Thrower, and Dismember.

After releasing ''...and your life...'', the band granted success, and got status of cult underground band. Miroslav than invited his bandmate Branislav Blagojević, for the role of rhythm and acoustic guitarist. In september 1996, band recorded second studio album entitled "Through the Labyrinths of the Sleeping Galaxy", and released it in 1997. This album was a success, and first Serbian album influenced by Scandinavian black metal scene.

On the end of 1997, PsychoparadoX changed genre again to more progressive and technical death metal than before. Marko Jugović left the band, and he was replaced by talented drummer Damir Adžić.

In 1998, Branislav because of personal issues became absent from band's activities, and Srđan took over rhythm guitars. After some time, the third studio album of PsychoparadoX is recorded, and entitled "Apeiron" (which is according to reviews still the best Serbian death metal album). On this album, Branislav just played additional studio guitars, and acoustic, and Srđan took over rhythm guitars and vocals. 

In 1999. NATO starts operation "Merciful Angel", and band's status was set on hold. On that time, their song "Apeiron" appears on German compilation "Underground Melodien". 

After the war, Branislav Blagojević definitely left the band, and Srđan formally became the guitarist of Psychoparadox, but now only a studio vocal. Also, Dušan Šupica joined the band as a live vocalist, and Branislav Dabić as a keyboardist. Band with that line up played again on "Concert of the Year" in Novi Sad in 1999. 

In the end of 1999, band was put on hold because of Damir had to go to the army. In that time, Branković brothers, hugely influenced by old school heavy metal, wanted to change the genre of Psychoparadox, but soon changed their mind, and formed band Alogia (band name took from song from "Apeiron" album).

In 2002. band re-released their third album, and entitled it symbolic "Reapeiron". Album also consisted a bonus song, and last song that PsychoparadoX recorded entitled "Metal Storm" which was by fans called the hymn of metal. In 2004. Srđan started working on 4th studio album of Psychoparadox, but he stopped because of Alogia. Band than played on "Exit Festival" in Novi Sad in 2007.
