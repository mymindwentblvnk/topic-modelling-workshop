Distruzione is an Italian death metal band, active in the Italian metal underground since February 1990.
The members propose a fine pure Death Metal, a little influenced by the nordic school, but sung in Italian. They released one EP, "Olocausto celebrale", and three full-lenght albums: "Endogena", "Pianeta Dissolvenza" and "Malicidium".
After 16 years and many tours around the peninsula, they still aren't so famous and popular probably because they use their mother language, although the music is very power and dynamic. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Distruzione">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
