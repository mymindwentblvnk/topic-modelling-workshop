From their beginnings in Birmingham in 1995, Broadcast’s aesthetic has remained a combination of their love for film, library music and electronics with psych-pop colour – a style which has gained them fans including musicians such as Flying Lotus, Tim Gane from Stereolab, Grizzly Bear, Atlas Sound and Dangermouse.

The Focus Group is Julian House, long time friend of the band and renowned artwork designer. House is co-founder of the Ghost Box label, which in the last few years has birthed a cult of its own with releases reflecting its creators' obsessions with library music, English folklore and the eerie feel of vintage programmes for schools and colleges. His music as the Focus Group offers some of the most enchanting distillations of all the above, instantly complementing Broadcast's own long-standing aesthetic. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Broadcast+and+The+Focus+Group">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
