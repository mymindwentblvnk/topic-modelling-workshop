There is more than 1 artist by this name

1] A band from Cologne, West-Germany; classed as a 'modern' take on the non-genre 'krautrock'. It could be said that they share musical similarities with Can, who were also from Cologne; however they have also assimilated influences from music styles that have come along since the German experimental rock explosion from the late '60s - early/mid '70s; such as Techno. There is also traces of bands such as der plan to be found in some of their music; especially on the later album Yog Sothoth.

2] Workshop - A humor metal band from India combining metal with influences of bhangra, garba, hip hop, raygay and other assorted music styles. The band lineup is: Ze Demonstealer (of Demonic Resurrection fame) on vocals/guitars, Riju: Bass and Hamza: Drums.

Their profile reads as:
When satan and god had sex, the big bang happened. However since satan was prone to multiple orgasms another bang happened.... and thats how Workshop was formed.

A polyrythmic drummer, a classic rock chromatic scale playing bassist and a fiery demonic monster all combined, with their powers united as one, a musical comedy of sorts is the best way to define the creative power of the Workshop.

Playing a vast span of genres ranging from EMO to Garba to Bhangra to Pop but all injected with the venom of demonic metal is what the musical creations of Workshop could be classified under. 




3] a defunct indie rock band from Pittsburgh, PA.
