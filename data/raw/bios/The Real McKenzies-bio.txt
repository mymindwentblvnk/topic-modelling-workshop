Real McKenzies is a Celtic punk band founded in Vancouver, Canada in 1992, described as "a guitar-and-bagpipe wailing Celtic punk rock-and-roll". They have set themselves apart from other punk bands by including bagpipes in all of their studio albums and at most of their concerts, much like the similar bands Dropkick Murphys and Flatfoot 56. Their current piper, Matt MacNasty, has been with the band since its release of "Loch'd and Loaded" in 2001.

Lead singer Paul McKenzie leads a high-energy act which does extensive concert tours, including an eight-month, twenty-three-country tour in a van. On these tours they have shared the stage with Shane MacGowan, Rancid, NOFX, Flogging Molly, The Misfits, and even Metallica.

In addition to their original music, the McKenzies also resurrect old Scottish and Irish favorites, giving them a modern arrangement. Their songs have been used in beer commercials and featured in video games
