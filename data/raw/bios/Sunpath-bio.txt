The second Sunpath is a progressive rock band. The name stands for virtuosity, richness of musical elements, bursting rock sound, but also subtle melodies. The five musicians combine rock, metal, jazz, blues and funk and develop a innovative, unique music.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sunpath">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
