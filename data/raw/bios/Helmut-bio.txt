HELMUT are a blues / rock / metal band from Geneva, Switzerland.

After releasing the EP "Mjöllnir" in 2007 and a first album "12" in May 2009, both based on nervous and energetic metal riffs, they naturally slipped back to their roots, the Blues.
Two years later, summer 2011, Laos Etxemendi of Gojira, jumps in to produce HELMUT’s 2nd album "XI IX XI", released on Heimathome Records . Based on dirty bluesy riffs, the guitars are supported by metal dominants on drums and vocals.
