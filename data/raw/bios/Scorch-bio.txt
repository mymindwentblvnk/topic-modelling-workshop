There are two Scorch, the first one is a french techno producer and the second is  a grindcore/death metal band from Switzerland.

2/Scorch was founded at Silvester 00/01 by Dani (bass and vocals) and Raphi (guitar and vocals). In Spring 2001 they start playing and composing their first songs. To complete the band, they searched a drummer and a singer. Some useless singers and drummers later, Dani decide to take over the vocals as well. But there was still no drummer on the horizone.

In 2004 the band was finally complete. Martin took over the drums. At the end of 2005, Scorch entered the 'Hellvete Studio' to record five songs. Scorch released in the year 2006 their first Demo, called "THE FIRST STRIKE".

Martin left the band in autumn 2007. But Scorch found a new drummer in the person of Gregor "Schorsch" Gut (former RELLIK) very soon, as well as Roman Hauser (former RELLIK) for double sick guitar sound. With Schorsch at the drums starts for Scorch a new age full of brutality, speed and sickness! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Scorch">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
