The Presets are Julian Hamilton(keyboard and vocals) and Kim Moyes (drums and keyboard). They are an electronic two piece from Sydney, Australia who met when they were both members of Prop. Hamilton and Moyes broke off from Prop in 2003, when they remixed a track, "Magnetic Highway", with "harder electronic edges" under the name The Presets. 

The Presets have been one of the biggest indie bands for the past few years in Australia, touring with and supporting many well known bands such as Daft Punk, 2 Many DJ's and Ladytron. Their first LP Blow up combines electro, rock, techno, pop and a handful of other genres together in a seamless manner. Their second album, Apocalypso, was released on 12 April 2008. The album was a commercial and critical success, winning the ARIA Awards for "Best Dance Release" and "Album of the Year" that year. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Presets">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
