Formed in France in 2009, Temnein is a Melodic Death Metal band, for fans of At the Gates, Dark Tranquillity, Ghost Brigade, Insomnium, Opeth, In Mourning… The band has previously released two albums: “404 B.C.” in 2014 through Mighty Music and “White Stained Inferno” in 2017 by Massacre Records. Both records gained good reviews in the international Metal press.

The 3rd album “Tales: Of Humanity and Greed” has been self-released by the band on May 22nd, 2020 with an exclusive worldwide digital distribution by Blood Blast, a new service powered by Nuclear Blast & Believe Music. The album was produced by “El Mobo” (Loudblast, ETHS, The Great Old Ones…) and all the visual work was made by Vincent Fouquet (Meshuggah, Kataklysm…).

The album’s lyrical concept is a collection of various tales, myths and legends: Asian tales, Inuit stories, pop culture themes (Dr Who, Legend of Zelda…). All those stories have a common moral: the repetition of human errors and greed across times.

Musically, the band sticks to their Melodeath roots with shorter songs than previously. However, Doom/Death and Post-Metal elements have been added to create more atmospheres, while keeping some Progressive influences as well.

“Tales…” got an incredible response from the press with reviews and articles featured on Metal Hammer UK (8/10), MetalSucks (video premiere), Metal Hammer GER (4,5/7 – Soundcheck #14), Bring the Noise (8/10), Discovered Magazine (8/10), MetalObs (4/5) Distorted Sound Magazine (7/10) and many more!

Over the years, the band has toured in Europe, UK, Russia and Japan, including support slots for: At The Gates, Beyond Creation, Mors Principium Est, Hate, The Crown, Svart Crown, Nordjevel, Shade Empire, Bleeding Gods…

The band has also played some European festivals: Durbuy Rock Fest, HRH Fest, Aalborg Rock&Metal Fest…
