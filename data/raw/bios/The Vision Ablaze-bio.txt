The Vision Ablaze is a Danish act formed in 2010. The music is an effective force of aggression, melodic passages and that hinted-at tech. The vocals carry great nerve and emotion and ranges from blow-torch screams to mellow and strikingly well sung cleans. To back the voice the guitars are crushing and progressive without ever loosing the foothold on great song structure - there's even an occasional solo! The backbone of The Vision Ablaze, the bass and drums, comply with all the above - while the drums maintain an original feel all the way through, touching upon semi-jazzy elements and off-beat rhythms and blast beats.

The 3 song EP "Nova" was recorded in January 2011 with producer Johan Ã–rnborg who has done work for names such as Opeth, Katatonia, Sonic Syndicate, Amon Amarth, Paradise Lost (and the list goes on!). It was recorded in Studiomega, Sweden - and Johan has handled all recording, mix and master.
