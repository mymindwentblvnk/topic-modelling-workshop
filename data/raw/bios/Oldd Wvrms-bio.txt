Oldd Wvrms is a band officiating in an occult register insisting on a dark and tormented atmosphere. Blending the heaviness of Doom and Sludge with a Blackened touch. Drawing its inspiration from ancient tales of witchcraft and forgotten rituals.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/OLDD+WVRMS">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
