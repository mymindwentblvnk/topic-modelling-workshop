Roosevelt Franklin refers to 2 artists, consisting of a Sesame St character and a hip-hop duo.:

1. Roosevelt Franklin appeared on Sesame Street from Season 1 (1970) to Season 6 (1974). The precocious Roosevelt Franklin attended Roosevelt Franklin Elementary School, where he taught the class as often as not. 

He taught concepts like family, pride, respect, and not drinking poison. Roosevelt was a cool kid who loved to scat, rhyme, and sing the blues. His mother was proud of him, but often could not find him.

In addition to his elementary school, he had his own stadium, Roosevelt Franklin Stadium, where he coached the Headball.

Matt Robinson, who played Gordon Robinson during the first three seasons, performed Roosevelt's voice.

For a while, Roosevelt was considered one of the main characters on Sesame Street. He even had his own record album, The Year of Roosevelt Franklin. Despite significant popularity, he was dropped from the cast following letters complaining of a negative African-American stereotype, and because his rowdy elementary school did not set a good example for children. Roosevelt continued to surface occasionally in storybooks, however, as late as 1996. 

2. Roosevelt Franklin is also a hip-hop duo consisting of mr. len (of Company flow) and Kimani Rogers (of Masterminds). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Roosevelt+Franklin">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
