NEVERNESS is born around 1998 in Valladolid Spain, when after several attempts, the band reaches their definitive formation with Rubén García (drums), Víctor Pérez (keyboards) and Javier Nieto (guitars and vocals), David Martín (guitars) and Paco Tamariz (bajo), so the band is officially born.

During 1998 and 1999 the band rehearses and prepares material for their first release and after this period the first songs see the light with a clear 70's influenced Symphonic sound, which leads to the release of their debut album "Horizonte de Sucesos", album that adds Pstycodelic and Hard Rock elements that places them clearly in the style of late 90's and early 2000's Symphonic bands that blend different influences.

It's peculiar to know that this album was recorded twice, because the band was not satisfied with the sound and decides to record it again but in the period between recordings Ruben García leaves the band and is replaced by Antolin Olea who is still with Neverness

This album has a clear Symphonic sound with songs that have an average of 15 minutes each one and placed the band in the eyes of the fans of the genre, what pushed them to release "Renacimiento" a four CD set made exclusively of improvisations originally recorded for their debut album, very hard to be found.

The band was planning to release a third album with the name "Omnia Mutant" but a series of things lead to the temporal dissolution of the band, specially the departure of the bass player Paco Tamariz, and it's not until 2006 when the bad is resurrected and they start working in their next project called "Cuentos de Otros Mundos Posibles" released by Musea records in 2007 still with a Symphonic structure but obvious influences from King Crimson and porcupine Tree.

Very good band with a solid sound I think we can expect other great albums.
