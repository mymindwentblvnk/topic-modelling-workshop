Slothrust is a jazz-influenced grunge project consisting of guitarist/vocalist Leah Wellbaum, bassist Kyle Bann, and drummer Will Gorin. Jazz and blues graduates of Sarah Lawrence College, the three gravitate toward music that is heavy and full of lyrical grit, dynamically fusing the rawness of the 90s with contemporary edge. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Slothrust">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
