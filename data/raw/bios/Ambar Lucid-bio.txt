North American musician from New Jersey. On first listen, you’d be hard-pressed to associate Ambar Lucid’s music with a specific time or place. Her voice is a dramatic instrument, equally comfortably singing just above a whisper and belting inpirational choruses. Ambar sings in both English and Spanish, a nod to her Mexican-Dominican background—and an affront to the relatives who told her to stick to one language. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ambar+Lucid">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
