Similar to bands like Kamelot, Nightwish, Epica, Symphony X and more, Moonlust is a simple, yet elegant name, derived from our love of the night.

Moonlust started whenever Chris Santos, lead vocalist, and Omar Garza, keyboardist, met Andre De La Tejera, drummer, at a Kamelot concert in San Antonio, Texas.. Chris and Andre are both multi-instrument musicians, so we knew Andre had to join us in our quest for Power Metal!

Fueled by pure passion we set out and found our guitarists, Chris Barrera and Jacob Vargas, and our bassist Ernie Infante, immediately learned our songs, and started recording and are set to officially release "The Revelation of Time" on May 22nd. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Moonlust">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
