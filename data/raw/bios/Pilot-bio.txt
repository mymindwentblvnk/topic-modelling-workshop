There are multiple artists with this name:

1) Pilot was a rock group formed in 1973 in Edinburgh, Scotland by former Bay City Rollers members David Paton (vocals and bass) and Billy Lyall (keyboards).

The 1974 single Magic from their debut album was a #11 UK and #5 US hit and remains a pop classic. The simple but catchy pop ditty January gave them their biggest hit, securing the #1 spot in the UK singles chart in January 1975.

The band's only other chart hits were Call Me Round and Just A Smile (both 1975). By the time 1977 came around only Paton and Ian Bairnson (guitar) were left from the original foursome, and they recorded Pilot's final album (the aptly entitled Two's a Crowd) alone.

By 1978, all of Pilot's members had moved on to other projects, notably Stuart Tosh (drums), Paton and Bairnson becoming core members of The Alan Parsons Project (who recorded their first album), and Tosh also working with 10cc.

2) Pilot is a rock/new wave band from France.

3) Pilot is a reggae artist.

4) Pilot is a solo artist.

5) Pilot is a female fronted pop punk/hardcore band from California

6) Pilot is a Fusion Group from Turkey

7) Pilot is a young pop rock band from Prague, Czech Republic.

8) Pilot, also known as PilOt  (Russian: Пилот , ПилОт ) is a Russian rock band from Saint Petersburg, founded by Ilja Knabengof in 1997. Years active: 1997–present.

The roots of the band stretch back to 1994, at which point it was called Military Jane . In this incarnation, the band had a raw, melodic grunge style reminiscent of Alice In Chains, and featured Knabengof singing in English. Military Jane released three albums, "Home" (1995) "Home Live '95", and "Blackest Paint Colored Brush" (1996) with limited success. The band's single "Wherry?" although popular, was met with controversy and the music video was banned from MTV. During the "Rock '96" festival in Saint Petersburg, the band performed a new song "Мама" (Mama) for the first time. The style of the song took on a contrasting pop direction, with Knabengof finding an original singing voice. The next year, Military Jane 's name was changed to Пилот  (Pilot). In February 1999, the band launch its first official website.
