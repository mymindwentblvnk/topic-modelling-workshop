Wrnlrd is a an experimental black metal project from Arlington, Virginia, United States, started in 2005.
Working with guitar, bass, fiddle, banjo, synths and samples, Wrnlrd throws metal, industrial, noise, dark ambient and folk musics into a blackened and bubbling cauldron.
Wrnlrd records spontaneous, wordless vocalizations and details the lyrics later, improvises massed guitar tones, buries samples deep into the mix and brings the disruptive and unpredictable elements of improvisation and chance into recording.  Wrnlrd albums have referenced the science fiction novels of Cordwainer Smith, surrealism, automatic writing and the arcana of Washington DC.
Beginning with the self-released "Mask of Hate" under its Order of the Cloven Eye banner in 2005, Wrnlrd has released five CDs. The first Wrnlrd LP, "Oneiromantical War", was released on the FSS label in May 2008.
