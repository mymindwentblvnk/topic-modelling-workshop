UNHOLY GHOST was formed in Tampa, FL in January 2003 by former DIABOLIC members - drummer Aantar Coates, bassist/vocalist Paul Ouellette, guitarist Jerry Mortellaro, and Kelly McLauchlin, founder and guitarist of PESSIMIST. 

In just a few weeks the band recorded and distributed a self-produced 3-song demo, quickly getting airplay on college radio in the US and favorable reviews from around the world. The recording also attracted the attention of Olympic/Century Media Records, who quickly signed the band. 

UNHOLY GHOST immediately began playing live shows and secured slots at two major fests: Snakenet.com "Metal Nation" and the Las Vegas Metalfest, further making a name for themselves as one of death metal's most promising upcoming acts. More shows soon followed, including hi-profile shows with the allmighty DEICIDE and "Sun 'n Steel", the 1st Annual Florida Metalfest. 

The band soon entered the well-known Diet Of Worms Studio to record their debut album, "Torrential Reign" with producer Juan "Punchy" Gonzalez (MORBID ANGEL, DIABOLIC) and emerged with a stellar result... 11 tracks of extreme metal featuring annihilating dual-guitar shredding and a flurry of maniacal blast-beat insanity, matched with an aggressive and devastating vocal assault. 

A flood of positive reviews, interviews and radio airplay soon followed, establishing UNHOLY GHOST as leaders amongst the newest generation of bands in the Black/Death Metal underground. 

UNHOLY GHOST debut full-length CD "Torrential Reign" is out now and available on Olympic/Century Media Records.
