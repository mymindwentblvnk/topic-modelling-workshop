Flowers Forever is the side project of Tilly and the Wall member Derek Pressnall. They have recently been signed to Team Love records.

Out of a disastrous feeling described as either having seen god or having had a bad bout with mono came Flowers Forever. Awaking one morning on the verge of a nervous breakdown lead singer and guitarist Derek Pressnall came to earth shattering resolve that there was something he needed to inject into his life; as the song “Golden Shackles” repeats again and again, “change better come!” The Tilly and the Wall guitarist immediately turned to art and the exploration of creation, working towards whatever he could. The result was Flowers Forever, a band almost tragically based around a save-the-world type of positive self expressionism. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Flowers+Forever">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
