SPINALCORD is a Japanese indies rock/metal band that started in 2002 as AUSHVITZ, but was renamed for the relaunch of their activities after a 2-year pause in July 2008. Their three-piece line-up consists of Syu (Galneryus) on vocals & guitar, Kyoichi on bass and backing vocals, and most recently Junichi (Galneryus) on drums, who joined their ranks after the departure of their original drummer Kon in January, 2009. Their website has ceased updates since early 2011.
