Justin Sane is the lead guitarist and singer of the political punk rock band Anti-Flag.

He has released two solo pieces to date; a 6 song EP entitled "These are the Days" and "Life, Love, and the Pursuit of Justice" in 2003. These recordings generally focus on love, family, and more everyday concepts rather than the politically charged stance of Anti-Flag. He is currently working on a new solo record, and has begun to preview new tracks during live performances.
