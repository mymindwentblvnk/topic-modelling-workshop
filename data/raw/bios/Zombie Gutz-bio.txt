A band as epic as Zombie Gutz could have derived only from another equally as epic band. Two to be more precise. About a year or two ago, there where these two bands, Four have Fallen (Taylorsville) and Tomorrow Can Wait (Wilkes County). Both bands had played many shows together and were exceptionally good friends. They were doing well for themselves (FHF with two magnanimous albums and TCW with one supremely bangin' album to make up for not having two). Eventually, due to certain complications...and a girl, the melodic metal conducted by the two possies of music makers had to come to an end. But not completely. One year, and many changes later FHF and TCW live on in what is now considered to be a legacy...Zombie Gutz. Amen. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Zombie+Gutz">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
