EverLight (Matthew Seagrave) is a young electronic music producer and DJ from the midlands, in the United Kingdom.

Born in the small town of Nuneaton, UK, and starting at the age of 8, Matt taught himself Keyboard and Piano. By the age of 12, he had his own basic music production system, fluent keyboard skills and a noticeable ear for music. And at the age of 16, he finished his first album entitled "Music is life, live life to the full" under the name "DJ Sea", Released (by himself) worldwide via iTunes and most popular online music stores. The album was an instant hit; being featured in track lists and supported by trance fans worldwide.

At the age of 17, he changed his producer name to EverLight, and finished his albums "Never Dark" and "Visions in sound", at this point recognition was picking up, and the record label Andromeda Recordings took his music on board, and over the next two years released 20 tracks made by EverLight, including the 2008 best sellers "Frostbite" "Distance" and "Do It Right"

Now, at the age of 19, his ongoing studies into graphic design and his thirst for widespread musical recognition have brought him to the UK's second largest city, Birmingham, where he attends lectures at Birmingham City University by day, and works his way through the ranks of the vivid club scene by night.
