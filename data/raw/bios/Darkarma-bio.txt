DARKARMA is a Heavy Metal band from sunny Miami, Florida. The members are four talented, young musicians Giovanni Angel, Jonathan Rusten, Steven Vanni and Ben Katzman. This band has always been pushing their own limits as well as others around them to be the best musicians they can be. They are very active in the Miami music scene and have played alongside national acts such as DEICIDE, INTO THE MOAT, MONSTROSITY, ATHEIST and AGHORA. DarKarma's new E.P. showcases their talent tremendously with their epic solos, bone crushing drums, blood curdling vocals and stomach punching bass lines. DarKarma will be embarking on tour soon and hope to set fire with their sound to every club they play in! DarKarma has played in many venues around the Miami area such as: Revolution, The Factory, Churchill’s, The Tiki Bar, Club Flavour, Kaffe Krystal, Club Xit, Culture Room and many others. DarKarma has also won a battle of the bands competition in 2005 as well as one in 2009 against 40+ bands. Their influences are very eclectic with each member’s footprint in their music. With the new E.P. coming out in the summer, it will truly show a great example of what DarKarma is capable of. They can play many styles and still create a unique part of it that makes it theirs. A DarKarma show is always fun and different and will break new ground in the future for heavy metal music.
