Message To Bears is the musical alias of English folk/electronic composer and multi-instrumentalist Jerome Alexander. 

Alexander creates beautiful soundscapes by interweaving acoustic guitar, piano, electronics, ethereal samples, strings and hushed vocals.

In 2007 Jerome self-released his first set of home recordings (simply titled EP1) which sold out almost instantly thereby catalysing a conversation with the then newly-formed Dead Pilot Records about a re-issue. 

Having discovered a commonly-shared ethos, Dead Pilot Records and Alexander decided to work together again for Message To Bears’ second release (Departures), an album which was overflowing with lush strings and saw the first introduction of voice into Jerome’s recordings. Limited to 500 CDs, the album was packaged in an organic case, wrapped in brown parcel paper and tied together with string. Every single copy also came with an individual, unique old photograph hidden inside. As with EP1, this became quickly out of print.   

In the summer of 2009, Alexander played his first Message To Bears live show in Oxford with the help of his close friends playing a wide variety of instruments. They have since shared the stage with artists such as Nils Frahm and Olafur Arnalds.  

January 2012 saw the release of 2nd LP 'Folding Leaves' through Dead Pilot Records (UK) and Nature Bliss (JPN). 

Jerome released a new electronic EP under the alias J.R Alexander during December 2012 through Sound In SIlence Records.

Jerome’s 3rd full-length album entitled ‘Maps’ was released 12th November 2013, his first self-released album since his debut.
