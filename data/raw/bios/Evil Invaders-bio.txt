It all started in the year 2007 when 2 metaloholics Jöe Anus and his cousin Agent Stavröz decided to start a band. It was very easy to find a drummer. Because 1 of Jöe's best friends was a drummer. And that's how Speedfreak Frey got involved with the band. After a year of just jamming, drinking and covering, we found a bassist. Steve Tomsin joined the band and from that moment we decided to call it "Evil Invaders". We had our first gig in january 2009. But after all the gigs done in 2009 we kicked Tomsin out because he was a total poser and we couldn't count on him! A few days later our maniacal friend and huge Evil Invaders fan, Stringking Pussymagnet Alain joined the band. He's a great musician and we're really happy that he's a part of Evil Invaders. In october 2010 Agent Stavröz is being replaced by Uncle Sam (guitarist Fall ouT). Now we're really ready to kick some ass with new killer thrash/ speedmetal songs! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Evil+Invaders">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
