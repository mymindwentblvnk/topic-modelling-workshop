The Ones were a New York City based dance music group best known for the early 2000s hit single "Flawless." The trio consisted of vocalists Paul Alexander, JoJo Americo, and Nashom who met while working at the Greenwich Village boutique Patricia Field. Each of them had a background in performing, DJing and being stylists within the underground NY club and fashion scene.

Their debut single "Flawless," produced by A Touch of Class, was popular among New York DJs even before its official release and became a huge Dance hit, especially in Europe. In 2004 "Flawless" was sampled and had lyrics added to it by George Michael for his song 'Flawless (Go To The City)'. The group released a follow up single "Superstar" before going their separate ways.

In November 2006 they released their new single "Ultramodern" <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ones">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
