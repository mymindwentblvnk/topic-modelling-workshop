The band was first founded in 2008 by the two permanent members, the keyboard player Marko Lukic and vocal Dragica Maletic. Later on, the band has gone through several changes of members, that lead to the present, final line-up, including Ilija Markovic (bass), Aleksandar Travica (guitar), and Dimitrije Vasic (drums).
The band is currently working on new material and promotion of the two videos, for the songs Faith Remains, which came out December 2013 to great reception and Someone's Mirror, which came out this June. 6 more songs have been finished and are to be recorded soon, after which 2 more songs will be finished to complete the album.
The band members have not had professional musical training, but have been passionate about metal music for years; since 2008, the band has had many shows and gained loyal local followers - the trend to be continued with the new line-up as well, having many shows booked and being invited to many international demo festivals during 2015.
The musical influences are many, some of which are: Nightwish, Evanescence, Kamelot, Tristania, In Flames, Disturbed. The mixture of sounds results in a new twist on the well-known female-vocals-with-grunts formula; it has a new strength to it, an added driving force that separates the band's sound from others. Demist songs range from the sweet, flowing melodies (as in Faith Remains and in the ballad Let it Rain) to the harder, heavier and darker songs (such as: Someone's Mirror, Welcome to the Underworld and Nemesis). However, the band remains consistent in its recognizable style, constantly surprising the listener and drawing him deeper into the sound of Demist.
