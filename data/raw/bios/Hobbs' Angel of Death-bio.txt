Hobbs' Angel of Death were an Australian thrash metal band that began in the mid 1980s, together with Mortal Sin they were one of the earliest successful Australian thrash metal bands.

The band began in 1985 as a solo project for ex-Tyrus guitarist Peter Hobbs, with the help of ex-Nothing Sacred members Mark Woolley (guitar), Sham (drums) and Karl Lean (bass), who recorded a number of demos which attracted interest from overseas labels. Hobbs' debut self-titled album was released in 1988 through German record label Steamhammer Records, which achieved a great deal of success in Europe. A second album, Inheritance was released in 1995, but failed to repeat the success of its predecessor and was an Australia-only release. Hobbs' Angel of Death broke up soon after the release the album.

In 2002, Peter Hobbs put the band back together and released a compilation album of his two early demos, and the band played a European tour including an appearance at Wacken Festival, and shows with German thrash legends Destruction and black metallers Mayhem. This has been the strongest point of the band's career so far.

Although playing traditional style thrash metal, Hobbs has often described his band's sound as "virgin metal", stating his sound as a pure style of music. The band ended in 2019 due to the passing of founder Peter Hobbs. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hobbs%27+Angel+of+Death">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
