Pure, unadulterated rock and roll.

Providing an aggressive, experimental take on modern rock, Silent Vice is a talented band of young musicians who continually push the boundaries of their genre. Seamlessly weaving heavy riffs and dynamic vocals over a thunderous rhythm section, Silent Vice has created a sound all their own.

Band Members:
Kevan Kiely-Gilden - Vocals and Keyboards
