UNDER EDEN is an extreme metal band from Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota, USA.  The band formed in 2000, released its first demo in 2003 to positive reviews, and then a full-length entitled The Savage Circle in 2005.  Over the course of its existence, UNDER EDEN has performed live infrequently, focusing mostly on local support of touring acts (Nile, Hypocrisy, Watain, Sigh, etc.) and various local/regional festivals.  

The musical style on the first demo was mostly a mixture of "Bay Area" thrash and melodic death metal, but the Phoenix on Frozen Wings EP released in 2008 showed that style expanding to include a wider range of death metal and black metal elements.  Comparisons vary from Dissection to In Flames to Carcass.  Lyrically, the first album covers the extent of metal territory - death, destruction and oppression of all kinds - delivered mostly with a low death metal growl that subsides into clean singing once or twice.  The newer EP material sticks entirely to a growled vocal style, and the lyrics are more focused in a "storytelling" type of arrangement.

UNDER EDEN has announced that a new album, The Science of Self-Defeat, will be released in 2011. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Under+Eden">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
