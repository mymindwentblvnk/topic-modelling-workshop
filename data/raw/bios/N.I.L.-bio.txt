N.I.L. (Nihilism Is Liberation). Originally intended to be a one off project right after Krieg's European tour in 2004, with several songs constructed, Nil remained dormant until 2006 with J. Marcheski's enterance into the fold. Months of intensive writing and rehearsing resulted in the creation of a full length of droning, primitve and intense black metal. Signed to Battle Kommand Records for the CD release and Southern Lord for the LP release, Nil continues to manipulate and manifest itself into an evocative and regressive form of noise.

N.i.l is NOT the continuation of Krieg. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/N.I.L.">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
