Corpset was originally formed by the name of Chakra, in Oulu year 1998, by Jari Kelloniemi (ex-ARG) & Tommi Määttä (Sacred Crucifix). Chakra made two demos and few public appearances. This line-up broke up as the players moved around the country. Jari moved to Tampere in 2004. Frustrated guitar player had decided to sell his gear and forget about the career in music business. A buyer candidate Jami Heikkala (Devil Manmade, ex-Distained) contacted Jari and after a few beers they decided to test some riffs and Chakra's old songs together. Noticing the connection in the style of playing and musical interests, they felt like continuing these sessions. Not too much later they realized that they had a good pack of songs together, but no band. The guitarists kept on polishing the riffs and songs and practicing by themselves for over a year. In 2006 a drummer was found, as Timo Hanhijoki (Crystalic) was interested about the project and decided to join in. The band kept seeking for a singer around the area of Pirkanmaa long and earnestly and finally in summer 2008 they found brutal-sounding Antti Murtonen to do the growls. In the end of 2009, after some searchings and different temporal bassists, Jami's workmate Petri Palonkoski was chosen to cover the low freq's. With this line-up, Corpset is currently spending time promoting the upcoming album, writing new material and burning down stages live throughout the country.
