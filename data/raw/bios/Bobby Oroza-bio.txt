When looking for a description of the music Bobby Oroza makes, you may lean into some familiar territory: vintage-sounding, dreamy, sensual, a deep cut on some wonderfully odd indie-love-film soundtrack. And, yes, all of those attributes are accurate—but still, they fall desperately short of describing what Bobby and company have provided us in a short amount of time.   Raised in the immigrant-populated Eastern Center section of Helsinki, Finland, Bobby was born to a Bolivian mother and Finnish father. His family, his neighborhood, and the music that coursed through it all was his cosmos.  In 2018, the "This Love" single was re-released on Big Crown, with Bobby's rendition of Sunny & the Sunliners' 1969 single, "Should I Take You Home," on the flip. A year later, the full length dropped.  Rappers ranging from Earl Sweatshirt to Russ to Curren$y have sampled and reworked Bobby’s songs—a validating nod of sorts to Bobby's sultry musicianship as well as Cold Diamond and Mink's astute backing on drums and bass.  Since then, Bobby's talents have continued to expand and make their mark. The videos for the singles "This Love", "Your Love Is Too Cold" and "Strange Girl" are directed by him, Bobby exercising his darkly intriguing vision to follow his sound. With a new focus and a new outlook, Bobby and company are back with new material and a new record on the way. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bobby+Oroza">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
