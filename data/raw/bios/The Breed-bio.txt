1. The Breed (Aus)

 After playing a variety of popular venues in Tasmania (Australia) as part of their “Clothes She Wears” tour, the Breed have been much in demand as the ultimate authentic 60s party band. Their energetic sound has had them playing all over Tasmania.

The Breed features the talents of Wayne Crisp (Guitar), Steve “B&Massa” Jay (Bass) and Steve Bowden (Drums), and are a band which follow in the tradition of lively, fun “power-pop” but give it a modern edge, keeping it both relevant and real. Driven by a love for the music, a desire for perfection and just plain fun, they play an aggressive blend of 60s pop, merseybeat, mod revival and 60s garage.

With the launch of their debut CD “Regeneration” in January, the Breed also received interest and support from the UK and the USA. They demonstrate that beat, melody and energy are all you need for a fab night out.
