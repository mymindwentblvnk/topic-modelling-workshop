1) Taxidermist is the result of its musicians’ eagerness to melt their taste for and experience with styles as diverse as garage, hardcore and funk into one project, after they disbanded their previous collective, hip hop band Mosqio. A QOTSA-inspired rhythm section is the base for Taxidermist’s main characteristics: a double key-occupation, fiery guitar, the use of samples and a passionate singer. Stoner as hard as a rock, extraordinary funk jams, sick samples: Taxidermist’s songs are larger than life, freaky creations, bursting at the seams. Music and lyrics are not about girls and cars, but about road kill and the things you can do with that, about putting a soul into animals that are left for dead at the side of the road and frenetically sowing limbs together. The format: ramfunk, grooverock, postfunk, discostoner, whatever…fat, spun-out, loud.

2) TAXIDERMIST is Belgian hardcore.
