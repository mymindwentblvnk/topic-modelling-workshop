Gealdýr is a Nordic folk/Viking inspired project created by the Dutch singer-songwriter and producer Jonathan Barendsma. The name Gealdýr is a combination of the Gaelic word 'geal' (white) and the Old Norse word 'dýr' (deer).

After discovering the music of Wardruna while facing hardships in his own life, Jonathan Barendsma began to understand the healing power that music can have on the soul. Barendsma, who had been making music for years – mainly in the pop genre -, was keen to share his story through music. Inspired by the Poetic Eddas and determined to keep the ancient Norse wisdom alive, Barendsma released his first single, ‘Ragnarök’ in the fall of 2018.

With the single Gealdýr built a steady following and signed with Danheim’s Fimbul Records in January, 2019. Two more releases followed: Othala (February 4, 2019) and the EP Sær (February 19, 2019). Aside from working on his own projects, Gealdýr worked together with Danheim on several occasions. Aspiring to keep reinventing himself, more new releases can be expected in the future. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Geald%C3%BDr">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
