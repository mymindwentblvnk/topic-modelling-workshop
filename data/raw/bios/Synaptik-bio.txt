SYNAPTIK is a British heavy metal band from the East Coast of England. Formed in 2012, known to incorporate elements from styles such as thrash, power, progressive.
Synaptik aren’t afraid to mix up the influences and certainly don’t fear melody with their heavier than a black hole riffage and dynamic vocals, death metal aggressiveness with a progressive, melodic outlook. They draw on influences old and new to create a mutant hybrid sound-scape that makes them stand out.

Synaptik performed at Bloodstock Festival 2014 as winners of the Metal to the Masses band Competition. 

Synaptik have just released their debut album “The Mechanisms of Consequence” .
A video for the single “Your Cold Dead Trace” is also available.
The single features guest vocals from Alan Tecchio (Watchtower/Hades/Non Fiction/Seven Witches/Silent Assassins) <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Synaptik">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
