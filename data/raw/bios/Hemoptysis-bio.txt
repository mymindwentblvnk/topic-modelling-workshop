Hemoptysis is an American extreme metal band, named after the medical term for the coughing up of blood. Founded in 2007, the band's music is built around a solid core of old school thrash / death metal. However, they incorporate strong European elements of black metal and melodic death metal, as well as traditional metal. 2011 has proven a productive year for the Hemoptysis, as they have released their full length, debut album, Misanthropic Slaughter, signed a European distribution deal with Rock It Up Records, and appear on Heavy Metal Magazine's Gates Volume 1 - Ascension soundtrack. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hemoptysis">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
