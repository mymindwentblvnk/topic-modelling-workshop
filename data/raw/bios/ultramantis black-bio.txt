Members of Pissed Jeans & UltraMantis Black making grinding noisy hardcore. May or may not contain dudes from The Ultimate Warriors 

Alternatively...

Behold the debut EP of ULTRAMANTIS BLACK, the hardcore punk band created to spread the gospel of professional wrestling champion Ultramantis Black. Having spent over a decade dominating the Chikara wrestling scene, Ultramantis teamed up with members of the beloved punk band Pissed Jeans to form a blistering political hardcore band that is equal parts The Locust, Deadguy and Melt Banana. Imagine the best parts of 90s militant straight-edge hardcore filtered through the over the top theatrics of pro-wrestling and you have ULTRAMANTIS BLACK!
