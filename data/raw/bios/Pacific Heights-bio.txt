Pacific Heights is the solo project of Christchurch, New Zealand native Devin Abrams. More well-known as a member of drum and bass conglomerate Shapeshifter, Abrams released an initial self-titled EP by Pacific Heights of LTJ Bukem-esque breakbeats in 2002 on Christchurch label Fabel Recordings. The full-length Frozen Fears followed in 2003, which subsequently gave birth to a healthy collection of remixes in 2004 entitled Borne Together. In 2008 five years after his debut album, Pacific Heights released In A Quiet Storm. He has moved in a new direction incorporating downbeat hip hop, breaks and soul elements into the album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pacific+Heights">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
