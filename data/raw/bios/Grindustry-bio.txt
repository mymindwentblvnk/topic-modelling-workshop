it all started anno 1997 when Thomas and Raimon formed a band called "amputateyourhead".After a small year of rehearsing this band splitted up, for unknown reasons...

After 1 year of silence (1999) Rob, Raimon and Thomas got together to start a brutal death/grind called "MUCUS". In that time Rob, Raimon and Thomas build a rehearsalroom in an old pigshed in Doetinchem (Gelderland).

After rehearsing for 1 year they played 1 live gig and after that they splitted up, because there were a couple of misunderstandings between the members and everybody went their own way.
For a year Thomas was vocallist in a oldschool deathmetal band called "INFANTPHAGIA" and there Thomas met Ben.But this band was not the kind of music thomas and Ben had in mind, so after a year and a half this band also come to an end.

In March of 2003 at a grindconcert everybody came together again and after a few beers and baco`s decided to start a goregrindcore band.
Ben knew someone who could drum fast enough,and so Roel became the 5th member and in the summer of 2003 GRINDUSTRY became a full band.

That current line up:
BEN: guitar
ROEL: drums
ROB: bass
THOMAS: pigsounds,screams

Grindustry disbanded after awhile of splits and demos. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Grindustry">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
