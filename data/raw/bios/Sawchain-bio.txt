Sawchain arose from the ashes of the deathmetalband Nocturnal Grief some time in the autum 2001. Johnny, Fredde and Andreas all former members of Nocturnal Grief wanted to play fast metal with influences from the '80s...

In the spring of 2002 a crazy finnish guy named Toni joind Sawchain and after a while Stefan entered the band as the growler... Two demos got recorded but Toni had to leave Piteå and the band due to work. After months of searching for a new guitar player a close friend of ours, Joel(K), joind the band. We begun to play less melodies and more thrashier stuff, we also decided that Fredrik had a better voice for this kind of music and Stefan left the band. A year after that we recorded the “Architecture Of Evil" demo in Umeå at Dimrakk studios. The goal whit this demo was to find a new drummer....and so we did. Jonathan Asplund Joined Sawchain!

All members of sawchain lives in the town Piteå in the northern parts of Sweden. Sawchain playes some kind of fast thrash/deathmetal... <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sawchain">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
