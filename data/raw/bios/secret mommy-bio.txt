Secret Mommy is the Glitch-pop alias of musician and artist Andy Dixon, a guy born in '79 and raised in Vancouver, British Columbia.

Beginning in 2003, during the final months of his full band The Red Light Sting, Dixon began cutting sounds he recorded himself into shreds of their former selves. Despite sometimes being seen somewhat as novelty music, Secret Mommy never fails to win respect from the most scrutinizing of critics, who often notice his infinite attention to detail and appreciation of sounds that billions a day write off as the ‘noise in the background.’

He has been involved in the underground music scene since he helped start his first punk band, d.b.s, who played their first show when Andy was twelve years old. He has been playing guitar and writing music consistently since then.

He is currently a full time self employed graphic designer, under the name The Chemistry Designs. He also runs his own record label, Ache, and performs in the band Winning.
