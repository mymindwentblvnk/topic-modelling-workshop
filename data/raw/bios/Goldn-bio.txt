Josh Golden, born and raised in Missouri, began songwriting at the age of ten when he performed at church. After his first hit ''Used To'' in 2017, he moved to Los Angeles to record more material. He can be compared to the likes of the Weeknd, Post Malone and Mayday Parade. Ranging from R&B to pop and emo-punk, his songs involve love and heartbreak. In 2018 he released ''Mama, I'm so sorry'', and shortly after his EP ''happysad'' came out, inspired by a bad breakup.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Goldn">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
