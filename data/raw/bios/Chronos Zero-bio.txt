Chronos Zero borns in 2011 as a solo project of Enrico Zavatta.

Beside the orginal idea we made our way during these few years and the resulting project is what we are today!

Everything starts with Enrico Zavatta and Federico Dapporto since forever and in the late 2012 with Davide Gennari we start to get into right feelings.

In 2012, on the way of recording the the prelude chapter album (A Prelude Into Emptiness, 2013) due a stylistic choice we decided that we needed an aggressive but still melodic oriented singer..and that he could perfectly suit the chemistry of the composition.
The best choice been found: Gianbattista Jan Manenti (singer of Love.Might.Kill).

..and from then on we started this awesome cooperation.

For the year 2013 Giuseppe Rinaldi joined Chronos Zero as keyboardist.


In 2013 we presented ourself with 2 products :

“A Prelude into Emptiness – The Tears’ Path Chapter Alpha” Bakerteam Records-Scarlet Records – 10 tracks album
Guest Claudia Saponi (Absynth Aura) and “Zaza Helheim” Sara Cusato from Hyperborean.

“Inner Gates of Oblivion Suite Pt.01 : Overture” a side story from the main narrative which willl help the narrative itself in the last chapters of The Tears’ Path
with an amazing solo by Michele Dr Viossy Vioni (Absynth Aura, Maestro)

In summer 2014 Margherita Leardini and Manuel Guerrieri (Crawling Chaos) joins officially Chronos Zero.

To celebrate this event we published the second part of Inner Gates of Oblivion Suite: Amanomurakumo. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Chronos+Zero">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
