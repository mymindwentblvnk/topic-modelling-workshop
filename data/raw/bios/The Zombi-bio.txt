Finnish death metal band The Zombi was formed with the original name Zombi in 2003 by guitarist Paavo Härkönen and vocalist Ville Vuorinen. In the beginning, the music was heavily inspired by Six Feet Under, later shifting perhaps to a more brutal approach and a style closer to Cannibal Corpse.

Lacking a drummer, the two-man project made their first songs using a drum machine and released them on the most popular Finnish website for free music, Mikseri.net.

During these times also legal issues occured, as The Zombi was threatened by a lawsuit from Relapse Records and had to change their name from Zombi to The Zombi (Relapse Records has a band called Zombi).

Before the release The Zombi also made an appearance on Heavy Karaoke: Basement Tapes Vol 1 DVD with the song "In the Cellar".

Recently two new members have joined the band: Janne Rönkkö on guitars and Ville Ryöti on bass. The band is now getting ready for touring...
