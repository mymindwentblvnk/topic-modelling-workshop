FROM EARTH is a brutal music collective from the Netherlands formed in 2012, defining darkness, melancholy and extreme heaviness in its own way. 

Having gained over a decade of experience, touring all over the world, sharing stages with tons of legendary bands and recording numerous albums, former members of Born From Pain and Blind Sight merge to form a new monster of brutality, defining darkness, melancholy and extreme heaviness in its own way. The time has come to resurrect out of the ashes and arise FROM EARTH!

After the break up of their former band Blind Sight, Tommie Bonajo and Dave van Loon decided to join forces to write some new and challenging material. This material turned out as a daring mixture of modern metal with a melodic touch, but making it more dark and heavy then ever before. Recruiting three armed fellow members with former BORN FROM PAIN vocalist Ché Snelting as their frontman, the ship is now fully loaded and ready for battle!

FROM EARTH recently finished their debut album, keeping the production in own hands by guitarist and producer Tommie Bonajo at his Tomsterproject Studios. Be prepared for some thick grooves, crushing rhythms, shredding guitars, pounding bass and aggressive vocals from guttural to grinding melody and beyond!

In union to dominate the stage with an overhauling thrust of power, FROM EARTH is a force to be reckoned with!
