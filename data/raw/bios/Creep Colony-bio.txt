Fetus Eater, Skin Peeler and Damian Motisi formed Hellbound with Julian Narvali on bass. This band existed for a year playing straight-up metal, with Damian and Eater sharing vocals. Wanting a dedicated vocalist they posted an ad on internet classifieds and Gary Cancer took up that role, bringing a very death/black metal vocal style to the band. 
Damian was unfortunately deported in the summer of 2004 to Argentina. Hellbound was very surprised to discover that Gary was also a good enough guitarist to play alongside Fetus Eater, and since then he has played his more classic style of guitar and done vocals. 

 
After a good while of Supernova gigs and with the recording of a CD upcoming it became clear that there were dedication difficulties with bassist Julian Narvali, and a classified ad was posted for a new bassist. 
Hiding The Carcass was recorded in July, 2005 at Machinehead Studios with hours the band won at various Supernova events. Fetus Eater and Gary Cancer shared bass duties in Julian's absence. 
The classified ad for a bassist was answered by Rotten Scrotum of Belgium's CERIANTHUS. He was moving to Canada and wanted a heavy band to play with. 
They returned to Machinehead Studio in early September to master the CD.

Currently recording new CD, it should be done soon and a couple of previews are up.
