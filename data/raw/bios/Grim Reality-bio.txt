Grim Reality were a hardcore band from Melbourne, Australia. They existed in the mid to late 1990's. Their sound was very reminiscent of the New York style hardcore. Grim Reality didn't record much material. They released a classic 7" - Out To Win, Straight Up Hardcore Demo and numerous compilation tracks. All of these recordings were compiled and a discography was released - To The Death.
