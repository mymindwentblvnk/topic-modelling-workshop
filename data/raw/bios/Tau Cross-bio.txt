Formed in 2013, TAU CROSS is an international punk/metal supergroup from Montreal, Isle of Skye, and Minneapolis.  Fronted by Rob "The Baron" Miller, vocalist and bassist of the hugely influential UK metallic-punk band Amebix, with Michel "Away" Langevin from VOIVOD on drums, and guitarists Jon Misery from cult crust outfit Misery, and Andy Lefton of War/Plague, TAU CROSS is the natural evolution of Miller's work in Amebix. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tau+Cross">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
