there are at least two projects under the name 'Cold Sun'

1. Cold Sun, also known as Dark Shadows, was a United States psychedelic rock band from Austin, Texas. They recorded one album in 1970, which remained unreleased until 1989 when the Rockadelic label issued a limited vinyl edition of the album as Dark Shadows.

2. UK-based musician Simon Slator, who produced delicate atmospheric ambient music. He was active approximately 2001-2003, producing several albums under the name Cold Sun, including 6am, Antarctica, and Four Patterns.

3.Cold Sun, Dark Shadows. or Dark Shadows, Cold Sun. A Texas band.Contrary to popular bilief the Rockadelic release above is a not a straight reissue of an acetape.An acetape was found with several tracks by the group (only one known copy exists now in a private collection).. and through this acetape information to the group was dug up.The leader of the band was found to several tapes of sixties material and from these tapes the Dark Shadows album was mastered.Most of the material on the Rockadelic album does not appear on the acetape.The release is well worth picking up-
a genuinely phychedelic item with lots of superb and often discordend electric autoharp & sustained fuzz quitars & lots of fresh ideas.The vocals don`t always reach the same standar but this album is recommended

4. Heavy Hardcore band from southeastern Wisconsin http://coldsun.bandcamp.com/ <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cold+Sun">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
