BSN Posse is a project that saw the light of day in the beginning of 2011, being the result of the musical fusion between two members of the group MMC: Sergio Ruiz (Stay Puft) and Enrique Gervilla (Broken Lip).

Since its formation, the two musicians have continuously edited tracks, coordinating various styles of electronic music in order to create their own sound: Future Garage, Melod√≠as Purple, Dubstep, Glitch, Soul, Dub, Witch House, Uk Funky...

Their first EP "Green Poison" was edited by Supercool Records, a label from Tampa Bay (Florida), and was published in December 2011.
Currently they are working on their second EP, Forthcoming on Slime recordings (UK) <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/BSN+Posse">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
