Chrome Shift is a progressive metal band from Denmark.
Their only release to date, "Ripples in Time" (2003), features mature song writing, thick keyboards, moody guitars and tasteful drumming, the whole thing delivered by a fine vocalist with a great range who displays both emotion and power – something of a cross between Damian Wilson (ex-LANDMARQ, AYREON), Daniel Gildenlöw (PAIN OF SALVATION) and Stefan Zell (WOLVERINE). The music could be bolder, with perhaps more creative and compelling arrangements – fewer dominant keyboards and louder guitar, for example – but if this cd is any indication of the band's potential, surely they will come fully into their own by the next album. Definitely a nice piece of ear candy, especially if you like song-oriented metal.

Fans of DREAM THEATER, PAIN OF SALVATION, and particularly RUSH and ARENA will no doubt welcome the 'SHIFT'.
