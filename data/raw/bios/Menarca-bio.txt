There are multiple artists named Menarca:

1) Menarca is a minimal synth project from Italy, formed by Antonio Facci Tosatti with the help of Gianni Pedretti (Colloquio).

2) Menarca is a death metal band from Caserta, Campania, Italy, formed in the Spring of 2005 by Alfredo (guitars), Antonio (drums) and Stefano (vocals, bass). They came from other metal bands of the local underground scene: Infected Brains (Stefano, Antonio) and No Mercy (Alfredo).
They have established strong ties using their common artistic visions, which lead them to compose their first songs immediately.

They released the first demo “Heart Bleeding” in 2007.
