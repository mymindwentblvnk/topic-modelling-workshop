Inanimus Theory are a new 4 piece band based in Mildenhall, Suffolk, here to ask questions of music, then tear up the answers and do it our own way! Formally known as Astro Zombies, are brimming with ideas for the future. Watch this space!!! We have started churning out ripping tunes that are infectious and heavy like '3 Shots', 'Braveheart' and 'Uninvited'!!!!
