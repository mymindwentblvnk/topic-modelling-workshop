Wandar plays melodic Black Metal, which is orientated towards the aesthetic of
Scandinavian Metal music, without reproducing any stereotype and walking along
preceding path. The influences vary from traditional Black Metal of the second generation
to Swedish Death Metal, Folklore and classical music.

The music is catchy and diversified at the same moment; interlocking harmonies oppose
not only head banger rhythms, extreme singing and acoustic parts. Discreet adopted
synthies support the rather raw Nordic voice. Within this combination Wandar creates an
epic-atmospherically image full of emotion, longing and aggression.
If music was a picture, Wandar would display a glacier, mountains and forests as well as
mead horns, fire and endless darkness.

The lyrical influences are, besides the northern mythology, the philosophy of the
enlightenment and the philosophy of the outgoing 19th century, the Magick of the left
hand path and the disrespect of the new engineered world.

In January 2008 Wandar's first EP "Vergessenes Wandernâ€œ was released and can be purchased at
