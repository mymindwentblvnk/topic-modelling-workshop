2. Makina is a Trash Metal band formed in Mexico City in 1990. In 1991, with the former lineup of Paul Rivers, Gizmo Reza, Hans Mues and Carlos De la Pe√±a, Makina produced their first album, Dilemma, which was distributed only in Mexico and the southern United States. After the departure of Rivers and Mues, Makina returned in 1994 with a second album called Anabiosis, which introduced them to a wider audience worldwide, in part due to the music video for the song "Nymphomaniac" being promoted in MTV's Headbangers Ball. Their third album Red came out in 1996. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Makina">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
