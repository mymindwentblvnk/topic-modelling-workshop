2) Hailing from North West London, the 5-piece alternative rock band, ATUM, set out to bring depth and conscientious sentiment to a genre that often lacks both. The band draw on their cultural diversity, crossing continental Europe to Asia, to craft melodically strong, adrenaline-packed music. The ultimate result is a mature sound that spans an extensive yet eclectic influence list stretching from Jeff Buckley to The Mars Volta. They are no stranger to the London gigging scene having embarked on a successful tour in the run up to the release of their debut EP, Analog Schizophrenia . The six track release was recorded at Outhouse Studios under the skilful eye of John Mitchell, known for his work with Funeral for a Friend, Enter Shikari  and Architects. ATUM are currently in the studio working on a follow up release as industry interest continues to rise in a band that already commands a rapidly growing social network following in excess of 65,000 fans.

Band Members: Michael Hupping - Vocals | Ryan Creed - Lead Guitar | Glenn Fernando - Rhythm Guitar | Stephen Banks - Bass | Peter Balaskas - Drums

3) Instrumental stoner/groove band from Koprivnica, Croatia. They released their first EP, Atum, on March, 24
