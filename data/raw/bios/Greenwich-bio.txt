Greenwich is a two-piece indie-folk group from Gilbert, Arizona. Formed in mid-2007, this group has surpassed the idea of what good, heartfelt indie music can and will sound like. With their simplistic lyrics, beautiful harmonies and interesting arrangements. Having released their EP “everyone looks normal when your eyes are closed” on cd and iTunes, it was quickly met with praise for its uncomplicated style, but completely emotion-filled spirit. They are currently signed to Free Sushi Records and plan on recording their first full length studio album this summer.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Greenwich">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
