Warnjan was born in the summer of 2001 in a town in Pontevedra (Spain), though it wasn't until 2003 that got a stable formation. In January, 2004, Ángela joins the band as leader singer, after the departure of Jose. 

With Jony and Morales at the guitars, Piru at the bass and Richy at the drumms, the band started playing live until 2005, when Ciano substituted Jony. With this line-up the band recorded a demo (Sombras), in June 2005 in Mix-Plus studios. This demo shows a heavy metal influenced by bands such as Metallica, Iron Maiden or Dream Theater.
