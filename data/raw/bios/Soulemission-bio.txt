In 2014 band members Benny and Roel made an alliance to form Soulemission. Their musical skills and motivation were screaming to create harsh metal with different influences and styles. Honoring the sounds and records from classic death/black metal bands from the nineties, they started writing music for the next year. 
Within the music influences from black-, thrash-, heavy- and death metal can be heard, which makes the songs versatile and interesting to listen to. 
In that same year Michel joined forces on vocals and since then takes care of the lyrics as well. Lyrics which basically deal with occultism, misanthropy, melancholy and death. 
The covenant was sealed with guest-drummer Menthor (Enthroned, Lvcifyre, Nightbringer ), who did the drums for the debut album ‘Tales of Inevitable Death’. 
By the appearance of Niklas Kvarforth (Shining) as guest-vocalist on the song ‘Seas of Emptiness’ the circle was complete.
With their background in bands such as Prostitute Disfigurement and Cirith Gorgor , the band-members left permanent traces in the metal scene behind. And by creating their harsh metal with alternating influences and styles, these traces are to be extended with Soulemission! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Soulemission">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
