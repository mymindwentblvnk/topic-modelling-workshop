"Hybrid Illusion, as obvious as it may seem, has not been around for an incredibly lengthy period of time, however, hailing from Adelaide, Australia, it is hard to say any of the members of this young band have no experience in the metal arena. 

Having already made people in the metal scene stand up and take notice, the team of Andrew, Alex, Nick, Ryan and Tom pride themselves on their intense lyrics, riffs and live performances. A mix of everything metal, this five-piece is ready to make an impact wherever they can, doing what they do best. 

HEAVY-F*CKEN-METAL. "
