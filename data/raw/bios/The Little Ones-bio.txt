The Little Ones are comprised of Ian Moreno, Edward Nolan Reyes, Brian Reyes, Lee Ladouceur, and Greg Meyer. Coming together in Los Angeles, United States in early 2006, the summery-sounding Little Ones wear their influences (the Beach Boys, the Zombies) on their sleeves while composing some of the brightest indie rock of the new millennium. They self-released their debut EP, Sing Song, that spring. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Little+Ones">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
