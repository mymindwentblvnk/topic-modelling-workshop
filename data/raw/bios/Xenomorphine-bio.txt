Pudasjärvi, Finland (2009 – present)

Xenomorphine is a Finnish electronic music project, formed by Miko (Neurodrived @ Last.fm). The idea of Xenomorphine is simple: to create danceable electronic music for cyberpeople with extraordinary themes, humorous samples, wicked melodies, chemical beats and - of course - crazy attitude. This is cyberdance!
