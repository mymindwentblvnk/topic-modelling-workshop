Left in a slumber, not dead but dreaming, Tranendal has been awakened to unleash its misantropic tunes upon the world.

The two founding members started the project in 2006 but due to involvement in other bands and projects one single track (Kings of North) was the solemn prove of Tranendal's existence.

As time passes so does ones musical taste. Bands and projects came to an end and now the time is here for Tranendal to rise from its dormant state. The new material is more harsh then the doomy black influenced tunes of K O N and goes back to the early 90's black metal.

Currently plans are made for a split album which is scheduled within the upcoming months. Tranendal has also recorded a song for the Magick Rituals project by Svartgalgh Records. Be sure to keep an eye for that release as it'll be a very limited amount of copies.. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tranendal">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
