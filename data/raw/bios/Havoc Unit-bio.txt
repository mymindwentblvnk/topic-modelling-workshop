Finland is dead! Now rises the new age of machines: the industrialized proclamation of Havoc Unit - Modern Society Mass Concentration Camp. Havoc Unit [M.S.M.C.C.] is the new propaganda machine & the audio-visual forum for artists to collaborate without restrictions: a test channel where neurons communicate via chemical and electrical synapses in order to spread audio-virulence and bacteria. The iridescent concept album [h.IV+] is a terror assault on the world taboos, and for parental advisory, its explicit content may raise animosity. Listen-Consume-Delete!

Collaborating artists on h.IV+: And Then You Die, Audio Parasite, no Xivic, Solefald, Strom.Ec
