Estoner is an Estonian rock band that formed in 2009 in Tallinn, Estonia.

Musically the band can be described as a weird mash-up of crushing doom metal, the juiciness of stoner rock riffage, the songs have build-up characteristic to progressive rock, with an attempt to squeeze in surreal effects of old-school psychedelia. Throughout time, they have called themselves stoner rock, stoner doom and psychedelic doom. Those genre names are however quite misleading and it would probably be correct to say that Estoner is an experimental metal band.

They have released a demo-cd, a debut album The Stump Will Rise performed abundantly in Estonia, and also been on a tour through Europe which led them all the way to France. While keeping a lower profile for a few years Estoner has experimented even more and will re-emerge from deep beneath the earth's crust with a lower and thicker sound, presenting a new album in April 2016, followed by a tour in Europe.
