7) From Cold Spring: "Heavy / Power Electronics sinking into the dense and gloomy atmosphere of the damp bunker.... impregnated with the smell of death, violence and attrocity... Atonal electronics, dark melodies, hypnotic loops. Monuments of fear and stress. Themes of military genocide, anti-selection to some sexual deviations, motivation for the war, death and folly". For worshippers of Genocide Organ and Operation Cleansweep"
