Vancouver’s Life Against Death combine old school thrash riffing with aggressive hardcore, top it off with extreme vocals and unique arrangements to create their own take on a familiar genre.  The group is currently getting set to release their third album in five years before heading out on tour in the fall of 2013.

The new, self titled, album was recorded at The Hive over three frantic days with Jesse Gander (Bison BC, Three Inches of Blood, the Pack A.D.) engineering and producing.  The nine tracks, clocking in at a leisurely 22 minutes, demonstrate both athletic musicianship and well crafted brutality.  

It’s been 10 years and 16 members since Vancouver’s Life Against Death originally formed. Since the summer of 2011 Life Against Death consists of Claire (Twitchy Twitch) Carreras (Joyce Collingwood) on vocal duties, and Brett Roothless (Last Plague, The First Day), the only constant member of the group, still shredding the riffage.   Scott Innes (The First Day), the band’s original singer, returns to the group on drums after a break to do graduate work in English literature, and Steven Huston (Last Plague), providing the distorted low end frequencies, make up the rhythm section.  Their original blend of thrash, hardcore, punk and extreme metal has provided opportunities to share the stage with wide variety of groups from punk legends SNFU and Agent Orange to the extreme mathcore of The End.   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Life+Against+Death">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
