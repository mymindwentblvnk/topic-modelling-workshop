1. Illegal was a young underground hip-hop duo that exploaded onto the scene in the early 90s with firey lyrics. Sadly, Malik and Jamal only even released one album - The Untold Truth, which peaked at #119 on the Billboard 200 and #19 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums. The duo virtually dissappeared from the public eye until 1995 when they teamed with Too Short on the song, "Thangs Change", after which the group disbanded. Jamal Phillips would later release his debut solo album, "Last Chance, No Breaks in 1995 for Rowdy Records. Malik released one single for Rowdy Records entitled "Malik Goes On", but his debut album was shelved. Malik has worked with his cousin Snoop Dogg on Doggystyle, Warren G on Regulate...G Funk Era and Tha Dogg Pound on Dogg Food and finally released his debut album in 2005, "The Game Needs Me".
