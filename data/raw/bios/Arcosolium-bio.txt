Arcosolium was born in Alingsås 2008. It started so innocently as a death metal project by Petter and Felix. Julia joined not long after and later, Oskar joined the band too. After a while Felix left us and John took his plays as commander in chief of the artillery.

Arcosolium is pure Death Metal from Alingsås, Sweden. We will bring you war, death and pain with heavy riffs and melodys through our songs. We will give you hell of a liveperformence and you will not forget us and our gasmasks. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Arcosolium">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
