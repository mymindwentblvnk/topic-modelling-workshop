(2011 â€“ present)

Deep in the icy heart of winter 2011, Tides of Time was born in a basement in South Hadley, MA. The band's current incarnation includes founding members Wes Parker (Guitar), Zach Longhi (Bass), and Tyler Fretwell (Keyboards) alongside newcomers Joel Turcotte (Drums) and Chris Eriquezzo (Vocals). The group immediately stood out from their contemporaries in the Massachusetts metal scene for their clean vocals and progressive instrumental work. The group has since played with numerous local and national acts, notably Yngwie Malmsteen, Fates Warning, Hoobastank, Flyleaf, and Drowning Pool. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tides+of+Time">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
