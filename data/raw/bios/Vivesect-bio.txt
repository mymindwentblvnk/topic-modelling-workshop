Exploding from the barren plains of Central Illinois, Vivesect is a five piece thrash metal band
 that takes a no holds barred approach to creating brutal metal. Furious kick drums, shredding 
guitars, and violently aggressive vocals are all combined to shape Vivesect’s sonic assault on
 the average listener. That being said, it is also easy to hear that Vivesect spends time writing 
and fine tuning great metal hooks to make for an identifiable thrash metal experience. 
In late spring 2006, Vivesect was signed to Obscured Records, and released “Six Points of 
Direction” later in July. The album consists of eleven tracks that play through like a personal
 journey with questions of loss, faith, and the anger of acceptance. At the end of the year, 
Vivesect spent weeks touring Texas, Louisiana, and New Mexico, where the band shot a video
 for the song “Condemned.” Through a new partnership with Skateboard Marketing, fans will be
 able to find Vivesect burning on their favorite metal radio stations nationwide, as well as catching
 them on MTV2, Headbanger’s Ball, and FUSE. Coming soon!
