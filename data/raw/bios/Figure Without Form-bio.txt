Figure Without Form started in October 2005 with vocalist Oscar, ex-vocalist Dylan and drummer Ayumi. We decided to get some musicians from around the area to start jamming and make some original music. After a few months, we started doing some local shows and we went through a couple of member changes. Since late April 2006, the band has had a steady lineup of the five guys, Oscar, Andrew, Jake, Jackson, and Ayumi. Now that we had a steady lineup, we decided to continue making original music and share stages with bands we love. We are still pretty young, so we like to have fun with what we're doing and we are still learning more about music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/figure+without+form">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
