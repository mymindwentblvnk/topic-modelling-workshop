Apothecy came inside two young minds of Radovan and Tuky at school in 2004. In the beginning, the band carried a project-name Crewsince, made up of two words from todays text writer and graphics editor's shirt. The band started with rock and neo-punk creation. First duo-rehearsals were on electronic drum-pads and a small guitar amp in Tuky's bedroom. Later, a new member joined Crewsince named Rene as a second guitarist and later as a second vocalist too.Then the first unnamed song came. The band threw away their project-name and officialy called themselves as Fallen Pieces. Then the first real rock songs were created - One Day and later on Blasted Ways, but there still weren't any concerts, so members were visiting school of music in Nitra and their musician skills improved. Later on, the band metallized and composed the first metal song named Freakshow that we can also hear today after lots of changes. In 2006, on summer workshops, was Freakshow recorded and also a new song Lost Inside was created. Then the first small concert came in Nitra and first successes too. Few months later, Tukys brother Matus joined the band as a bassguitarist and the first real concert came on Rockfest 2007. One year later, Fallen Pieces faded out and a new deathmetal formation named Apothecy was born from ashes. After this change some other great concerts came and also some real raw and melodic songs. In April 2009, Apothecy finally recorded their firt demo album named Hidden Path. The album contains 5 songs and it is free to download. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Apothecy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
