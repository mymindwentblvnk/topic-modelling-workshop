One of only a handful of symphonic black metal bands in Venezuela. They have released one demo (and a split album containing this demo in 2004)before they changed their name to Dargothar. They play symphonic black metal which relies a lot on the keyboards, though guitar riffs are not missing either. Some female vocals are present as well. Fredrik Akhraeta (who won the award "Metal Hecho En Venezuela 2002-2003") did the keyboards and vocals on their first demo and split CD.
