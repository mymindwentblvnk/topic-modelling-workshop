Working For A Nuclear Free City came together in January 2004. Initially the studio project of the founding members Phil Kay (producer/keyboards) and Gary Mclure (guitars) since 1999, 2004 saw the band first take to the stage, now joined by drummer Jon Kay, bassist Ed Hulme and more recently Neil Harris (guitar). After a number of years confined solely to the studio, they began the process of turning the layered studio tracks into a more stream-lined live set and initial performances were extremely well received. During 2004, the band continued to perform live in their hometown of Manchester, gathering a considerable fan base. 
Key performances included Manchesterâ€™s d:percussion festival, the Leeds Festival and In The City. In 2005 the band have gone from strength to strength, with support gigs with Duke Spirit and Boom Bip amongst others, and radio play on BBC Radio 1 and XFM.
