White Lilium was founded by four 17-year-olds near Kiel, Northern Germany, in 2005. They combine various metal styles in their music. When the first EP, ‘Up to Velvety Clouds”, which completely consists of original compositions, found surprisingly much feedback, the first live gigs were organized. In the meanwhile, the line-up has changed and the second EP ‘II: Chrysalis’ was released, combining both hard and calmer, melancholy elements. 

In the beginning of 2009, White Lilium just completed –after some line-up changes - the recordings for their new demo “Tarantula”, which consists of 4 tracks, combining all kinds of Screamo, Metalcore, Deathcore and Progressive Metal.
Overloaded with energy and fire, they vary different styles, mixing dynamic and brutal parts with melodies, from clean vocals to high-pitched screams, from technical breakdown parts to simple choruses – Still keeping the eye on variety and originality. 
The criticism from the german press differs from “very positive and inventive, with high potential” to “just stealing from the big ones, nothing really new”. But focusing on the fact that they still like to play wherever and whenever they can, everyone can see their will to just have fun, playing until they collapse. 

The new demo “Tarantula” can be downloaded for free in the internet, for instance on their myspace-site: www.myspace.com/whitelilium
