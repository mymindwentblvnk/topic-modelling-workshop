The Frequency are an experimental rock band based in Los Angeles. Based upon a love of Moogs, the sound of a real Fender Rhodes piano and vintage Fender amps, the collective sound is a reflection of things old and new.  

While difficult to place in one genre of music, the band continues to explore the contrast between quiet ambient musical moments, gradual builds through lush melodies and string arrangements, and a final furious wall of sound climax that leave audiences in a state of momentary bliss. Inspired by music from Pink Floyd, Air, Can, and Spiritualized, the live show adds another level of intensity to the music. They have shared the stage with artists as diverse as Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, The Bravery, Primus, Matisyahu, Mutemath, and Lotus. The show has been described as an audio/visual feast for the senses and led Quebec City's Live Daily newspaper to declare "The Frequency should be on every rock fan's radar."

The Frequency have recently signed a worldwide publishing deal with Chrysalis Music in the UK and the song "Jim Gordon Part II" has been heard all over the globe due to being licensed for a yearlong BlackBerry television commercial campaign. Music from The Frequency can also be found in major motion pictures and television shows. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Frequency">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
