Magoth about Svartlund:
The band has been formed in December, 17, 2004. It's roots leads to Russia. I deny religions which have ever been invented by the HUMANITY (that means - absolutely all religions). However I do not set as the purpose propagation of my mentality as the mankind to me is deeply indifferent and hated. I am the only leader and participant of the project. All compositions are written by me in full loneliness as I do not have any desire to involve someone else in the most gloomy depths of my soul. Why Black Metal? Because only Black Metal can liberate all hatred and aggression in relation to mankind and the world as a whole. 

Band Members: Magoth - guitars, vocals, bass/drums prog
