There are five bands named Memorial:

1. Emo/Post-Hardcore/Grunge band from Curitiba, Brazil. They've released their debut album Angústias Trazidas Para Casa on February 2nd, 2016. You can listen to it on https://memorialcwb.bandcamp.com/

2. Renee Heartfelt Pete Appleby's new band

Culled from the remains of Renee Heartfelt, Memorial is probaby the best post-hardcore band you’ve never heard. (Word has it it’s because of legal issues with RH’s old label.) To the devoted, frontman Pete Appleby is the second coming of Walter Schreifels. Pin that on Appleby’s pre-Memorial outfit perfectly aping Quicksand’s pioneering post-’core steaz. Since then, however, Appleby and crew have grown into first-rate songwriters. With their new EP they texture an epic tension and release in a way that sounds like they’re listening to more Elliott and Shiner these days instead of Straight Ahead and Floorpunch. And beneath the immediate emotional urgency you’ll find the acute sensibility that all these MySpace emo dweebs are trying, and failing, so hard to replicate with cloying hypersensitivity. This 7-inch was supposed to come out on Revelation, but the band is selling it as a digital download for now. A one-time vinyl pressing is supposed to happen soon. Keep an ear open for the LP that’s supposed to be out sometime this year. 

3. Czech rock/weirdfolk band from Pelhřimov and surround. Memorial played from 2002 to 2008.
Milan Holeček - bass, voc, lyrics. Radek Novák - drums. Petr Havel - guitar. Albums: Granite (2003), Mystique (2004), Deutsch, Remysticsed and Okolo slov (2005). http://www.sopel.freemusic.cz/muzika/memorial.html

4. Danish thrash/death metal band from Grindsted. Memorial has released the albums called "In The Absence Of All Things Sacred" in the end of 2008 and "Shatter The Art" in 2011. After the release tour in 2008/09, lead singer Neil Poulsen and bass player Rune Sinnbeck left the band. As replacement, Dennis H. Pedersen of Down Your Throat joined the band as the new singer and Morten Jacobsen as the new bass player. During fall 2010, Memorial toured Denmark with the bands Unbelief and Downswitch, promoting their new album.
