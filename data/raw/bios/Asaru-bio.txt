ASARU was formed in autumn 1995 by me (Frank Nordmann, G/V) and Dorian Kremer (B). Together with Robert Buth (D) and Sebastian Schmall (K) the line-up was completed. Due to a serious arm injury Dorian had to be replaced by Alexander Schmidt in summer 1996.

Around that time ASARU decided to add a second guitar and Marcus Hellstr√∂m joined the band. In October 1996 the first demo, D.O.M.A.I.N. was recorded. A few months later Marcus left ASARU again. The second demo, Darkness was recorded in December 1997, featuring Ruth Knepel for the first time on the song "Schattenkind".

In 1998 Torsten Hirsch joined on guitar. After many months without a rehearsal room Alex, Basti and me continued with Michael Szmyt (G) and Andreas Goericke (D).
In winter 1999/2000 the EP Baalpriku had to be recorded with programmed drums and I played all the instruments except Ruth`s voice on "Sea of Stars" and "Travel". Right after the recordings Mick got replaced by Marius "Zosch" Volz who gave the guitar position to Thilo Feucht in spring 2001.

In the winter of 2003/2004 Andy had to go and ASARU finally found Heiko Heil to take over on drums. At that time the RUNNING WILD song "Black Hand Inn" was recorded. You can find it on the RW tribute sampler "The Revivalry". In August 2006 the longplayer "Dead Eyes Still See" was recorded and strictly hidden from the public.

In March 2007 ASARU performed their last gig and I moved to Norway. Since then ASARU had no current line-up anymore and was put on ice (again). But in late 2008 a contract with ARTicaz records was signed to bring out the latest album. What's gonna happen in the future is still unpredictable. But it's possible that ASARU will rise again one day. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Asaru">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
