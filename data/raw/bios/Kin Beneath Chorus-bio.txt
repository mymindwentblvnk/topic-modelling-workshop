FAQ

What the hell is this "Kin"?

Many of you ask guys so, here you go! According to the Mayan mythology, Kin -or often called Ah-Kin- was one of many Prophets and highest Priests. Among his prophecies there was one predicting that the world as we know it, will perish as a result of Human Creations. 

Kin's view of the human race was that they thought, acted and behaved as a shapeless mass. Due to lack of judgement they spoke as if they were a "Chorus" repeating everything they were told. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kin+Beneath+Chorus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
