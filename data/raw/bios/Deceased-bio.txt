Arlington, Virginia, United States (1985 - Present)


DECEASED arose in 1985, drawing inspiration from BLACK SABBATH, VENOM, VOIVOD, RAVEN, MERCYFUL FATE, SLAYER and SODOM. During the period of 1985-1989, DECEASED recorded and circulated three demos (The Evil Side Of Religion, Birth By Radiation and Nuclear Exorcist ) that galvanized their reputation as trailblazers of original, technical American death metal. The 1988 hit and run death of bassist Rob Sterzel brought Les Snyder into the fold, completing the quintessential DECEASED line-up (rounded out by King Fowley on drums/vocals, Mark Adams and Mike Smith on guitars). Extensive self-promotion and frequent gigging up and down the east coast brought the band to the attention of a brand new label- Relapse Records - to which DECEASED were the first band to sign.
