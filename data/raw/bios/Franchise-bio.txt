Franchise was born in Toronto, Canada on May 3rd, 1994. He grew up in a broken home and at the age of four watched his mother force her boyfriend to make her a sandwich. When he refused, his mother began to beat the boyfriend in the face with her shoes after throwing various gang signs, an event in Franchise's life that would later become the driving force behind his music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Franchise">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
