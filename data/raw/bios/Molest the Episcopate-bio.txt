Auckland, New Zealand - ferocious new age technical death metal. 

Born from the smouldering fires of a veritable feast of New Zealand's best heavy acts, Auckland City's MOLEST THE EPISCOPATE formed in early 2010 as a collaboration between Ross McDougall (ex-Antagonist AD), Jeremy Suckling (Dawn of Azazel), Paul Blomfield (ex-Force Fed Trauma), Gareth Craze (ex-Graymalkin) and Josh Hughes (Bloodletting). 

The mission statement of the band is simple: to perform cruel, modern death metal as ugly as it is titantically heavy, and to stand aesthetically and lyrically in stark, unwavering opposition to religion of all stripes, socialism, pacifism, environmentalism and the anti-thought cults of modern liberalism and conservatism alike.

In 2011 Molest The Episcopate released their debut full length entitled Socialistica Nervosa. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Molest+The+Episcopate">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
