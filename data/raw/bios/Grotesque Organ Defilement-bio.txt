MINCE-CORE band which make an old school grindcore like legend bands from the 80s decade. The band currently live in Peterborough, Ontario (Canada). Their sound incorporates elements of early pitcshifted gore and tinges of crust punk. Although their lyrical content revolves almost entirely around gore, Grotesque Organ Defilement (also known as G.O.D.) adamantly expresses their leftist socio-political beliefs of Anti-Patriarchy, Anti-Sexism, Anti-Misogyny, Anti-Racism , Anti-Homophobia and Anti-Capitalism / Neo-Liberal Globalization.
