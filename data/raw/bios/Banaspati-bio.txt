Banaspati from Tegal, Indonesia

Formed in 2000, they brought a concept which was new at their time; blackened death metal. Their name was either taken from a fiery spirit of local beliefs with the same name or Hindi/Nepalese language of plants. In 2001 they released a demo named "Manungso Nggilani" ("Disgusting Humans") and in 2008 they released their first (and probably only) full-length album named "Headless Warrior" under a Swedish label Salute Records. Currently their status is unknown due to lack of activity and/or no other information available. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Banaspati">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
