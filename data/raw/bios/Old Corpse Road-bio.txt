Old Corpse Road have carved their name into the UK black metal scene by producing classic, yet unique British black metal based on the dark folklore of Britain. The Darlington based 6 piece formed in 2007 and take their name from a coffin road in the Lake District.

Dynamically their music flows from fierce black metal through to powerful melodic passages and onto serene yet haunting moments. The band incorporate a wide range of vocals from traditional black metal shrieks, guttural lows, spoken word passages and epic folk singing. Old Corpse Road bind these elements together to produce a solid yet original take on the black metal sound.

After an acclaimed demo and a split with The Meads of Asphodel they released their debut album ‘Tis Witching Hour…As Spectres We Haunt this Kingdom’ in 2012, which received critical acclaim from Metal Hammer, Zero Tolerance and Terrorizer as well as topping the Best Newcomer category in the 2012 Terrorizer Readers' Poll. After their recent split 7" with black metal band The Infernal Sea, they are currently working on the anticipated full-length follow-up to their debut album.

Throughout this time Old Corpse Road have built up a reputation with their intense and atmospheric live performances across the UK. The band have shared the stage with the likes of Shining, Alcest, Hecate Enthroned, Winterfylleth and Wodensthrone. Their return to Bloodstock follows their storming performance in 2010 on the New Blood Stage.
