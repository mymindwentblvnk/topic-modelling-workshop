Deventter is a progressive rock/metal band from Campinas, São Paulo, Brazil.

Back to 2001, the year that Deventter was formed, the first demo EP "The Beauty…And The Dark Side Of Our Lives", which consists in a 24 minute instrumental song, was recorded by Hugo Bertolaccini (K), Andre Gabriotti (B) and André Marengo (G).

Since then, Deventter has been growing up and has added 3 musicians to its line-up: Caio Teixeira (D), Danilo Pilla (G) , Felipe Schäffer (V) and, recently Leonardo Milani (B).

Deventter's newest work is almost ready!
