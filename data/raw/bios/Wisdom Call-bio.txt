Formed in 1999 with one album in 2001, Swedish power metal band Wisdom Call has had little activity since. This is probably due to lead singer Christian Rivel-Liljegren's current involvement with bands Divinefire (active member from 2004 to present), Golden Resurrection (2008 to present), and Audiovision (Christian's side project since 2004), not to mention the now disbanded band Narnia (1996-2008). All bands he is involved with have Christian lyrical themes. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wisdom+Call">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
