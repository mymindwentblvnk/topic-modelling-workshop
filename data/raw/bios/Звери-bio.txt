Zveri (Звери) are a popular Russian pop-rock band who burst onto the Russian music scene with their debut album Golod (Hunger), which received extremely positive reviews in the Russian music press. The group was formed in mid-2002 by Roma Zver' (Рома Зверь), the lead singer of the band. He was soon joined by Vladimir Khoruzhiy on guitars, Kostya Labenkiy on the bass, Kirill Antonenko on keyboards and Misha Kraev on the drums and the group began work on their debut album Golod, released in February 2003. This album, considered by many as their best work, contained many of the songs eponymus with the group, such as Dozhdi-Pistolety (Rains-Guns), Dlya Tebya (For You) and Prosto Takaya Sil'naya Lyubov' (Simply such a strong love). This release cemented Zveri's popularity amongst the youth of Russia.

In March 2004, Zveri released their 2nd album to widespread hysteria, entitled Rayoni-Kvartali (Districts-Blocks). It sold hugely and was accompanied by a tour of the country to promote it. Vsyo, chto kasaetsya was released as a single from it and standout tracks include Yuzhnaya Noch' (Southern Night) and Napitki Pokrepche. March 2006 saw the release of the group's 3rd album, Kogda mi vmeste, nikto ne kruche (When we are together, nobody is cooler), from which Do skoroi vstreche was released as a single.
