From MySpace (copy-paste):
"Formed in '92 with the name UNDERTAKER and released the demo "Senile Atrophy". Changed name to PARANORMAL WALTZ in '93. Released demo "Church of Torments" in '94. This demo was considered demo of the year in all Portuguese medias. After guitarist Ricardo Amorin was invited to join Moonspell the band stopped for a year searching for a replacement. Nuno Gonçalves took the guitar. Released MCD "In the Name of Tranquility..." in '96. After playing some shows, the band decided to concentrate on making new songs and recording. In '97 they completed the recordings of the first full album. Meanwhile, problems with the label caused the delay of the mixing process and the CD was finally released in '98. Due to this problem the band was left without a label, and decided to put all activity in stand-by until a new album could be released... In 2000 guitarrists Pedro Miguel and Nuno Gonçalves joined forces with Sacred Sin." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Paranormal+Waltz">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
