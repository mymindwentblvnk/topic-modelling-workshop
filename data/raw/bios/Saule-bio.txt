Saule is the solo project of Brussels based musician Xavier Garcia Bardon. His first eponimous album contains three tracks/soundscapes of sentimental, lyrical, yet experimental turntablism: romantic loops, introspective rhythms, feedback and vinyl cracks. It's violence and love! All tracks were made using three record players and a few prepared records. Saule has played with Kim Cascone, Janek Schaefer, Leo Kupper, Tony Conrad. He is also a member of Géographique (a duo that has played as support for Sonic Youth, Thomas Köner or Kato Hideki and with such artists as Köhn, Martiens Go Home and Ovil Bianca…) and of Buffle (www.myspace.com/buffle)

Another Band is called Saule et les pleureurs.
