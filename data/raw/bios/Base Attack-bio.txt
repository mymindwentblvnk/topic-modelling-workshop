Real Name:Andrzej Hołubowicz

Base Attack is an alias of Andrzej Hołubowicz, DJ and producer, who originates in Gliwice, Poland. He has been producing music since 1995, using Sensor alias at first. In late 2000 he formed a group "Base Attack" together with Paweł Mildner. They became famous in Poland for their specific hard sound and doing live acts. Their production "Acid" got good feedback and made them many fans. In late 2003 they made Base Attack breakthrough track "Everybody", which was noticed by Sebastian Kaizik aka Flashrider. Thanks to his involvement, the track was re-produced in Germany and renamed to "Nobody Listens To Techno" featuring vocals by Kid Panic and Eminem. The release was successful in German and other European DJ charts. In 2004 Paweł Mildner left the project, so since then Base Attack has become a solo project and alias of Andrzej Hołubowicz.
