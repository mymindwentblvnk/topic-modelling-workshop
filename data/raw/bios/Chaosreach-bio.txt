Chaosreach was formed when Delusive Grace changed their musical direction from dark metal into something more death metal. The guitarists, brothers Topi and Tatu Hiltunen are the founding members. Together they have been making their own kind of music for over ten years. Before the reformation Delusive Grace recorded three demos under their lead. On the last one they were joined with drummer Joonas Poutanen, with whom Chaosreach started to find it´s direction. In 2008 singer Jyri Pylvänäinen from Terhen (Firebox records) joined the group. Jarmo Leikas, also from Terhen, plays bass guitar in chaosreach. Chaosreach is from Mikkeli, Finland. In winter 2009 the group recorded their first EP under the name Chaosreach. Mikko Suuronen (Zetaworks) worked with them as the producer and sound engineer. He has worked previously with bands like Shamrain, Scarlet Youth, Exit Wounds, Hanging Garden, Bloodred Hourglass (BRHG) and Terhen. The drums were recorded in Jyväskylä at the university studio. Other instruments and vocals were recorded in studio Livsfara, Kangasniemi. The sessions produced a dark and heavy sound, into five powerful and affective songs.
