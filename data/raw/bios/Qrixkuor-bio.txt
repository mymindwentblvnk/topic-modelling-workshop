Qrixkuor was born of flame and baptised in blood in the year MMXI.

The first utterance "Consecration of the Temple" was released unto the world at the debut live ritual, April 26 MMXIV.

The name is taken from the Qrixkuor-bird in the Ninth Arch of Kenneth Grant's book, "Against The Light":
"It is without a Name because born of the Aeon without a Word outside the circles of time ... and of the Tangled Light, Qrixkuor." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/QRIXKUOR">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
