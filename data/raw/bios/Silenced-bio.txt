Silenced was a DIY punk/hardcore/crust band from Connecticut. Silenced played tuned down 'DIS' inspired Swedish influenced kang/raapunk.

The band originally formed in the fall of 1995 with Nate(guitar), Bill(guitar), Stretch(bass) and Donny(drums). They practiced at the hole-in-the-wall otherwise known as Fernando's Tune Inn in New Haven for a few months in the beginning. They didn't play their first show out until about March of 1996, at what was, at that time, The Pist house in Waterbury, CT. About the time of this show they recorded a demo in the basement, which was later remixed by Howard at Spiffy Trod Nossel in Wallingford. They duped a bunch of copies, slapped a black&white-puckrock cover and traded/sold/gave them away. During the summer of 1996, Donny and Stretch left the band, and Pete and Brendan joined up to replace. Donny continued playing music in Kitty Badass, and Stretch continued playing music in Anti-Flag (at least for a while). From fall '96 to Spring '97, they played a variety of shows, recorded at Trod in December, officially changed their name to Silenced, and planned split LP with Distraught. These plans were never realized before Silenced called it quits in mid May of '97. Bill & Pete continued on, and from the ashes of Silenced came React. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Silenced">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
