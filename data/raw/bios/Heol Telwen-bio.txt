Heol Telwen was a black metal / celtic metal band from Blanc-Mesnil, Upper Normandy, France. They formed in 1999, and split up in 2014, presumably after founding member Gwadsec'hedik Kraban left. They released one demo "Mor Braz" in 2003, and their only album "An Deiz Ruz" in 2005. Heol Telwen is translated as "the dark sun" in Breton language. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Heol+Telwen">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
