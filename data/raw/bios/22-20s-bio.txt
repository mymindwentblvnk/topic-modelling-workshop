22-20s were a band from Lincolnshire with indie, blues and folk influences. They formed in 2003 and released their self-titled debut album (22-20s) the following year. The band's name comes from the Skip James song '22-20 Blues'.

The success of the single 'Shoot Your Gun' and the track 'Devil In Me' shot the band to prominence after its use in a Vauxhall commercial.

In early 2006, after four years together touring, with difficulties recording their follow-up album and a desire to change musical direction, the band mutually agreed to split up.

The band reformed in 2008 and released Shake/Shiver/Moan in 2010 and Got It If You Want It in 2012. 

On 3 May, 2012, the band announced on Twitter that guitarist Dan Hare decided to leave the band.

22-20s quietly split for a second time in 2013. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/22-20s">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
