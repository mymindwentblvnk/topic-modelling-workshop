Masters of Luxury have evolved from an intense anger management exercise into a complex, aggressive, and a whirlwind of sound. With their foot firmly up modern rock music's ass, M.O.L. has managed to find a sound both distinctly familiar yet wholly original. Tossing aside conventional song structure and limitations, the band creates songs that manage to be catchy while never running the risk of boring the listener. 
Quote from All Hail Records:
"Formed from the ashes of a burnt-out relationship and a potentially successful blues/metal band, the Masters of Luxury evolved from an intense anger management exercise into a complex, agressive, and beautiful whirlwind of sound. With their foot firmly up modern rock music's ass, M.O.L. has managed to find a sound both distinctly familiar yet wholly original. Tossing aside conventional song structure and limitations, the band creates songs that manage to be catchy while never running the risk of boring the listener. Heavy. Progressive. Metal. Groove. SuperMegaRiffazoid. All these words can be described to describe M.O.L's brand of rock."
