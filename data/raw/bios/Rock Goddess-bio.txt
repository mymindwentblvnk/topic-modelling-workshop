Rock Goddess are an all-female New Wave Of British Heavy Metal band that briefly enjoyed cult status in the early 1980s in Britain.

The band was formed in Wandsworth, South London in 1977, by sisters Jody (guitar) and Julie Turner (drums) when they were thirteen and nine years old respectively. They recruited school friend Tracey Lamb on bass and Donnica Camon on keyboards. They rehearsed intensively and, through a friend, managed to place a track on a sampler album. The Turner's father, John, ran a music shop and used his connections to get the band gigs and finally, in 1982, a record contract with A&M. Donnica left the band and they released their eponymous debut in 1983 as a trio. There were legal problems because Julie was still attending school and was restricted in the number of live gigs she could play. Lamb became disgruntled at what she perceived to be the domination of the Turners, quitting to initially form SHE, but ending up joining Girlschool in 1987. She was replaced by Dee O'Malley and the follow-up album, Hell Hath No Fury was released in 1984. The band co-headlined with Y&T and Iron Maiden on UK tours and with Saxon in France. O'Malley announced her pregnancy and left the band in 1986. She was replaced by Julia Longman on bass and Becky Axten joined on keyboards.

After their A & M contract expired, a third album, Young And Free was released in 1987 in France only, but their career was cut short by financial and contractual problems which forced them to disband shortly thereafter. In 1988, the Turner sisters reappeared as The Jody Turner Band, and Jody fronted a new line-up of Rock Goddess in 1994 to promote the rerelease of the third album on the Thunderbolt label. The band reformed briefly in 2009 to play the Hard Rock Hell music festival in Prestatyn, Wales, but split before they had a chance to perform.

In March 2013 it was announced that the original line-up of Jody Turner, Julie Turner, and Tracey Lamb had reformed and would start recording a new album. The three of them began the process of recording a new album tentatively titled Unfinished Business. The album failed to appear, but in 2017 a 3-track EP was announced. 'It's More Than Rock and Roll' was released on 19 May 2017.

On 10 July 2018 it was announced that bassist Tracey Lamb had left the band and Jenny Lane was announced as the new bassist later that year. The band were then set to release their comeback record 'This Time' in October 2018, but it was delayed until 1st March 2019 where it gained a top 10 placing the UK rock/metal chart and a top 40 placing in the national indie chart.
