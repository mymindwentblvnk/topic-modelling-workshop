Lauren Aquilina (born Lauren Amber Aquilina on 23 June 1995 in Bristol ) is an English singer and songwriter of British and Maltese descent. She gained popularity by independently releasing a trilogy of EPs ("Fools" in 2013, "Sinners" in 2013, and "Liars" in 2014) whilst studying at school. Her debut album "Isn't It Strange?" was released 26 August 2016 after she was signed with Island Records and Universal Music Group.

Aquilina's musical origins began with her playing piano in school. She has been singing since she was eight years old and has been playing piano since she was nine. A trilogy of self-released EPs ‘Fools’ (2012), ‘Sinners’ (2013) and ‘Liars’ (2014) saw Aquilina peaking in both the Official UK Singles Chart as well as creating more than just a splash in no-less-than six Billboard charts with her brilliantly haunting, trilogy concluding ‘Liars EP’. A string of UK festival dates followed, underpinned by an invitation to headline BBC Radio’s prestigious ‘Introducing’ stage at Reading and Leeds festivals. 

Aquilina's song "Time to Say Goodbye" was featured in the season six advert for British drama Downton Abbey.

Aquilina released her debut album Isn't It Strange? under Island Records and Universal Music Group on 26 August 2016. 

Following a break from recording and performing, Aquilina released "Psycho" in 2018 and ‘Tobacco in my Sheets’ in 2019. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lauren+Aquilina">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
