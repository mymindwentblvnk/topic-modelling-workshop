Cryostorm was fully formed In late December 2007 With the intention of cultivating an exciting breed of metal. Combining beautiful melodies and solos with the technicality and snarl of death metal saw the band rise over the next year from a local act to a popular Titan of underground metal in the southwest. Since then, the Devonshire quartet have stunned audiences everywhere with their frenetic live shows and insane guitar solos whilst sharing stages such as the O2 Arena, London and Bloodstock's new blood stage with such acclaimed acts as Trigger The Bloodshed, Ingested, Shaped By Fate, Detonation and many more. After winning Devon's Metal 2 The Masses 2011 a mini-album entitled Destroyer Of Ardor was recorded in time for release at Bloodstock Open Air to critical acclaim, securing gigs with Onslaught, Gama Bomb, Beholder, The Defiled and more. Prepare to have your faces melted at supernova extents by the shredding, grinding, grooving, intelligently bright, beautiful and brutal melodic powerhouse that is Cryostorm.
