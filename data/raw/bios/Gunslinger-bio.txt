There are several bands/artists using the name Gunslinger, among them:

1) An electronic band. Gunslinger is the new sound of alternative dance. Forged by the musings of Chris Anthem and mad tinkering of Blare Vidal, Gunslinger pairs past with present, blending classic song structure and vocals with years of electronic dance experience to create one of the most natural and creative sounds of any genre.

Gunslinger has performed worldwide and opened for some of the biggest names in dance including Tiesto, Pendulum and Paul Van Dyk. Eventually signing with Coast ll Coast, they began touring with Infected Mushroom and in 2010 teamed up with Last Gang for the release of their debut CD, "Early Volumes 1," an epic song oriented journey through the worlds of electro, trance, and rock. Whether it’s a live rocktronica show of guitar, sythns and drums or a slamming electro/trance DJ set, Gunslinger aims to please. - Website


2) a heavy metal band originally founded as Chainsaw in 1979 by bassist/vocalist Alan Davey (The Meads Of Asphodel, Hawkwind) and guitarist Nigel Potter. Influenced by Motörhead, Hawkwind (whom Davey later joined), Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple, they built up a reputation for playing loudly and managed to gather a steady following. Although they managed to record a demo and get a recording contract, Gunslinger split in 1982 before recording a debut. They returned in 2008 to release Earthquake in E Minor featuring Alan Davey on bass and vocals, Nigel Potter on guitars and vocals and George Agent on drums. Their next live lineup featured James Tait on guitar and Sunil Jolly on drums (both of The Meads of Asphodel along with Davey. Their current lineup features Alan Davey on bass and vocals, his nephew Louis Davey and Cat Bothwell on drums and vocals. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gunslinger">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
