Tsar Bomba is formed in Paris, France uniting old friends from various musical backgrounds. The line-up finds their sound and writes their first songs, then initiates several concerts in the French capital. 

The aerial beat of the drums contributes to the alchemy between a huge gain guitar and a heavy fuzzy bass which support efficiently a clear and rough vocal. The resulting atmosphere reminds us the darkness of Acid Bath, the classical bluesy groove of Kyuss, the might of Karma to Burn or the thick and stoned ambience of Electric Wizard.
