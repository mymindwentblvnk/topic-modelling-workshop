Absence Of The Sacred (A.O.T.S.) was formed in early 2005 by Mike (Guitars/Vocals) and Hans (Drums). A.O.T.S. currently comprises of Mike, Hans, Justin (Bass) and Darren (Lead Guitars), forming a full blitzkrieg assault of lethal proportions.

A.O.T.S. has played in over fifty live shows locally and has emerged as a venue finalist in the World Battle of the Bands in Singapore, the first extreme death metal act in Singapore to ever reach that level in an international band competition.

A.O.T.S. has been active in the participation of major metal events in Singapore since late 2005 and have released their debut album “Atrocities That Birthed Abominations” in late 2006, which has garnered great reviews in local and foreign media. The album has received airplay in radio stations in the US, Australia, Japan, Belgium, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore.

Absence Of The Sacred has recorded a promotional EP in June 2007 for labels, and will be recording their sophomore effort at the end of 2007. For a metal band that has existed for a period of less than two-and-a-half years, A.O.T.S. have established themselves well in the Asian region and soon to a wider international audience, an extreme force to be reckoned with.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Absence+of+the+Sacred">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
