Eternal Mystery is a grindcore band formed in 2005 in Louisiana.  Having gone through several lineup changes, recorded and released splits from several underground grindcore bands, and even surviving as a one-man studio project by founding member Broc Toney, Eternal Mystery is a force that is proven to be near-unstoppable.  With the addition of Josh Cook on vocals, Jarrett Frangella on bass, and Zachary Fabre on drums, Eternal Mystery will keep pushing harder and harder, giving each live performance their all, and continuing to push boundaries with their music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/eternal+mystery">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
