The Prayers and Tears of Arthur Digby Sellers is an enormous band centered around Perry Wright of Durham, NC. Wright formed P&T in 2003 and shortly after, released the band's debut, "Psalterie." The Radiohead-inspired, self-described "sad bastard music" propelled Prayers and Tears to regional fame and critical acclaim on the band's 2005 sophomore release "The Mother of Love Emulates the Shapes of Cynthia." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Prayers+and+Tears+of+Arthur+Digby+Sellers">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
