Herman Düne is an Indie/Antifolk band with roots in Sweden, France, Switzerland and Israel, formed in 1999. The current band line-up consists of David-Ivar Herman Düne (guitars and vocals) and Neman Herman Düne (drums and sometimes backing vocals). Néman, who is not from France but Switzerland, replaced former drummer Omé in early 2001. Former member André Herman Düne left the band amicably,  playing their last show together on December 13th, 2006. André now performs under the pseudonym Stanley Brinks and the band was renamed Herman Dune (without the umlaut) since then.

Herman Dune have worked with several other bands and singers such as Julie Doiron, Leah Hayes, and Laura Hoch.

Although the band has nine official albums, they have worked on many side projects, some of which include Kungen, Ben Haschish, Ben Dope, John Trawlings, Fountain Boats, Satan's Fingers, and Fast Ganz. They have also played as the backing band for recordings by Julie Doiron (ex-Eric's Trip) and Kimya Dawson (ex-Moldy Peaches). Both André and David-Ivar have also released numerous solo CDs (mostly self-released CDRs). André and David-Ivar each contributed a song to the 2006 album by Françoiz Breut, Une Saison Volée.
