Formed in Hobart, Tasmania, Randomorder have been thrashing out their hard hitting style of Metal since late 2007, the brain child of Gabe Latham (Vocals/Guitar) who's menacing vocal style and original guitar riffs begged to be heard. Matthew Bicket (Drums/Vocals) Justin Wilton (Bass) and Rod McAllister (Lead Guitar) provided the backing needed to see the band switch into overdrive with an assault on the ear drums of their hometown of Hobart in 2008.

By the end of that year, Randomorder had built a solid foundation to work from and a demo was recorded and released. In early 2009, new lead guitarist Sean Kelleher entered the fold, forming the bandâ€™s strongest line up to date. With the inclusion of a new member, the band's music evolved to a more old school thrash metal sound. Another demo featuring new material was then recorded, receiving excellent feedback from the metal community.

The band continued to break new ground in 2010 performing in Melbourne, Sydney and Wollongong with some of Australia's most aggressive bands such as Dark Order, Rampant, Toecutter and Destend just to name a few. They also supported In Malice's Wake and Desecrator on their Australian tour in early 2011.

In March 2011, work began on Randomorder's debut album with renowned Australian heavy metal musician and producer, Joe Haley (Psycroptic), handling the recording and production duties. In September 2011, Randomorder's debut album titled THE FORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE was released independently. A savage and intense album, THE FORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE will please any fans of raw thrash metal.
