Lil Peep (born Gustav Åhr) was an American recording artist hailing from Long Island, New York. He was cited as one of the primary artists responsible for the post-emo revival with his style of hip hop which came to be known as emo trap. After a slight delay, his debut album Come over When You're Sober, Pt. 1 was released on August 15, 2017. Due to a possible drug overdose, he passed away on November 15, 2017 (aged 21).

Lil Peep was described as a "SoundCloud rapper", and his musical style is considered lo-fi rap or emo-trap. The New York Times defined Åhr as the Kurt Cobain of lo-fi rap and described his music as gloomy and diabolically melodic. Åhr's music generally draws on both southern US rap and the angsty introspection of the rock subgenre post-hardcore.

In 2015, Åhr released his first mixtape, Lil Peep Part One, which generated 4,000 plays in its first week. Shortly thereafter, he released his first extended play, Feelz, and another mixtape, Live Forever. In 2016, Åhr released two seminal mixtapes, Crybaby and Hellboy. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/LIL+PEEP">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
