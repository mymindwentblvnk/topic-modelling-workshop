This artist name refers to two different bands:

1. Connecticut-based punk band formed in 1985: www.fleshhammer.com/

2. English black/death metal band. Flesh Hammer is a side project that Miles Gardiner (guitar and lead vocals) and Nick Leatherland (drums) started whilst My Defiance was slowly finishing. With Miles now writing riffs as well as lyrics, and Nick putting drums to it all, all the band needed was a bassist to start gigging. Nick informed Lee Earley about this new band needing a bassist so he joined. Soon after Lee joining (2 days) there was Flesh Hammer's first gig. They recorded their first 4 songs as a demo which they made 30 copys of. They are now writing new material and will re-record some older songs for their new CD. They aim to write metal that is variated and unrepetitive, bringing in new things to their music to keep it fresh.
