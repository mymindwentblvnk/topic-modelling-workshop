1. Voodoo is a alternative-rock n' roll band from San Jos√©, Costa Rica.

Made in 2015, this band is a classic little gift from our artists from Costa Rica, very smooth and chill, with this heavy and beautyful touch of the guitar, the bass is pretty slow but in some plays, is very aggressive, the dumbs are slowly perfect.!


2. Voodoo is an Indonesian rock band founded in Jakarta 1991
