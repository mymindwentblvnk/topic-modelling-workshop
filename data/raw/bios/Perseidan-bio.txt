Talk about of PERSEIDAN means talk about JOHN M. PETERSON. This genious of thrash-death metal started his career in 1993, in Spain, doing covers of his favourites groups and learning to play the guitar in a self-taught way.
Since he started, he has formed a lot of bands, and PERSEIDAN is the result of a long trajectory, and a very hard work.
John M. Peterson has compose and recorded all that youÂ´ll find in his first studio album, "NEW METHOD OF VIRTUAL FICTION".
