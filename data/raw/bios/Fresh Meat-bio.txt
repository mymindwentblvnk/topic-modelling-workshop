There are (3) artists named Fresh Meat:

1) A noisy hardcore band from Allentown, PA. Ex-members of Carpenter Ant, etc.

2) Fresh Meat is a technical death metal band from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

3) Fresh Meat is a Berlin based DJ, who first developed an interest in DJing quite late, at the age of about 18. That was the time when he lured nice girls into his flat to play his favourite CD´s in order to impress, melt the lady's hearts and get some action. Well, most of times it worked (not sure if it was coz of him, the music he played, the selection or a combo of everything, though) so Fresh decided to get himself some turntables and a mixer to start off spinning some Drum & Bass, Jungle and other 90´s shizzle. Being attracted by all kinds of music, he started to buy some House and Minimal records as well. but soon he had to realise that he couldn´tt afford each and every style that makes him shake his hips. So the biggest task was to find out what he actually wants to play.

Working in England and the US of A for a while eventually lead him to genres called 'Breaks' and 'Electro'. First off he especially enjoyed listening to the kinky Miami Bass stuff from 2 Life Crew, DJ Magic Mike, MC Chief, G-Force, Kid Nice and so on. Very cool, but too old skool. But luckily, we had the British featuring Rennie Pilgrem to introduce some pimped breakbeats to dance to: "Nu Skool Breaks" was born, yet firstly, it suffered from too dark and heavy sounds. But the genre loosed up and many R´n´B´ and Funk influences had to follow: The Booty Breaks , his homebase now, emerged. not only homebase, tho. gotta stay open-mined, right?
