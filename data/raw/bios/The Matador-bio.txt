There's 2 bands using "The Matador" as the name:

1. The Matador is a southern hardcore influenced band from Omaha, NE formed back in 2007. The band released a 4-song demo in the Spring of 2008, and a 5-song CD EP 'Bad Day For a Snake' on Imagine It Records June 6, 2009.

2. The Matador are a 5 piece progressive post-metal outfit from South East Queensland, Australia. They cast themselves apart from the mainstream of Australian heavy music by creating a sound that ranges from down-tempo, complex ambient arrangements to epic, driving walls of earth-crushingly dense slabs of sludge. With influences ranging from Cult Of Luna, Isis, Thrice and Deftones to Radiohead, Interpol and The National, The Matador have consciously avoided the cliché of breakdowns, blast beats and death growls that currently saturate the heavy music scene. The debut EP 'Descent Into The Maelstrom' was released worldwide on April 21, and with this release and plans to tour Australia to promote it, The Matador are aiming to bring something fresh and exciting to the heavy music scene in 2011. As a live act The Matador are building a strong reputation as a force to be reckoned with, with comments such as ‘The band utilises experimental melodic sections which help create a landscape of atmosphere, and serve as progression to a later chaotic climax of sounds…’ (newnoize.blogspot.com) and ‘their sound reveals many harmonic layers buried within the post-metal exterior. It’s bleak yet hypnotic, desolate yet enchanting’ (timeoff street press) only beginning to describe the experience that is The Matador live. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Matador">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
