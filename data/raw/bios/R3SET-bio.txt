R3SET is the kid that brings you back to that 80's pop era even if you didn't live it. If his influences are some kind of various (from Van Halen to Daft Punk through Megaman), Lionel de Fontenoy found the way to mix up these infinite universes by giving electro-pop music a new face but most of all a new sound.

(!!! Nothing to do neither with new italian band called 'R3SET!' !!!)


RUNAWAY - EP and NUIT SUR LA PLAGE - EP are by french producer R3SET (Lionel de Fontenoy).
