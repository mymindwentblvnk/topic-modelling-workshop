3. FLIGHT was an eclectic jazz rock band from Florida led by American musician Pat VIDAS in the late 70's. They released three albums where the first two are an exceptional mixture of jazz rock with some symphonic influences. VIDAS was the very prominent and playful lead vocalist who also played brass instruments, which made FLIGHT sound not like a regular fusion band, but more like brass rock of CHICAGO inspired by EMERSON, LAKE & PALMER or even GENTLE GIANT, so their albums can be recommended to all who love very technical but at the same time accessible music. 

4. Flight (Taylor, Mississippi) is lo-fi garage rock from USA www.myspace.com/inflighttunes flight.bandcamp.com
