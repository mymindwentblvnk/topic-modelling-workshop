You know that guy at the party? Ya know, THAT guy! Yea, the one that no one knows, and no one invited. The one that makes bad jokes, and hits on all the girls. The guy who’s wearing a backpack. The one that doesn’t like your music, and changes the iPod. The one everyone knows stole that girl’s camera. The guy who gives himself a nickname. The guy who friended you on facebook that night. The guy that slept over when no one else did. The one huffing balloons at your kitchen counter at 10 am the next day. The guy that wants to go out for breakfast. The guy who gives you his number so you can call him next time you have a party. 

Yea. We’re that guy.
