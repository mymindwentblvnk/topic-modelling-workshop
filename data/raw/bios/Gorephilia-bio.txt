Finnish death metal band founded in the late summer of 2006 in Vantaa, Finland.  At that time Gorephilia, still known as GoretexX was formed by Jukka (guitars), Tami (bass), Henri (vocals) and Lauri (drums).  Early in the year 2007 the first demo Rotting was released. Later that year Roope took over Lauri's place on drums and the current name was taken to use.  Some gigs followed and one of them resulted in a live demo Ritual Exhumation that put together all of the "GoretexX songs."  An attempt was made to capture the three new songs in studio, but due to lack of a rehearsal place a satisfying result wasn't achieved.

After almost a year of stasis a new rehearsal space was found and Valtteri was brought in as a second guitarist. Unfortunately in early 2009, 3 of 5 members begun their compulsory military service which slowed down the pace of training new material.  Valtteri was then replaced with Jussi.

In 2010, their very first actual Gorephilia demo In Death was released.  In the year 2011, they released the EP Ascend to Chaos.  They went on to release two full-length albums as time went by.  They released their debut album Embodiment of Death in 2012.  Dark Descent Records released their debut album.  In 2017, they released their sophomore effort Severed Monolith.  It was also released by Dark Descent Records.   In 2018, they released a split with Undergang.  The split was released by Me Saco un Ojo Records.

Tragically on December 3, 2018, Henri committed suicide.  The band continued and Jukka is the vocalist. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gorephilia">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
