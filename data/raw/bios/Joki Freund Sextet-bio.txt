Tremendous early work from German saxophonist Joki Freund -- a player who would go onto much greater fame in the progressive years at the end of the 60s, but who already sounds plenty darn great on this early combo side from 1963! The style of the work is incredibly hip -- with a definite John Coltrane modal groove in place, but also a sense of globally conscious jazz that's very much in the spirit of classic Saba/MPS work, but which predates most of that by a number of years! Freund plays tenor and soprano sax here -- in a sextet with Wolfgang Dauner on piano, Emil Mangelsdorff on flute and alto, Eberhard Weber on bass, Karl Theodor Geier on bass, and Peter Baumeister on drums -- and the record is overflowing with great tunes that more than live up to the compelling title and cover image! Lots of "Eastern" styled numbers -- and titles include "Aisha", "Carribean Ringo", "Yogiana", "HL 20", and "Killer Joe" <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/JOKI+FREUND+SEXTET">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
