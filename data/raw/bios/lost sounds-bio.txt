Memphis' Lost Sounds began in March 1999 made up of Rich Crook (Lover!, Knaughty Knights, The American Death Ray, Reatards) on drums, Jay Reatard (Reatards, Terror Visions, Nervous Patterns, Final Solutions, Destruction Unit) on synth, guitar and vocals, and Alicja Trout (Black Sunday, River City Tanlines, Nervous Patterns, Destruction Unit) also on synth, guitar and vocals. 

The band, originally working within the garage rock genre, had a collection of analog keyboards Trout had used in her previous band The Clears. The bizarre combination of new wave synths and mangled guitars was coined Blackwave.  The band frequently dealt with dark, apocalyptic themes ranging from the Book of Revelation (Breathing Machine) to the Columbine High School shootings (Blackcoats/Whitefear). The band's last show was in May 2005 in Stuttgart, Germany.

Jay Reatard sadly died in his Memphis home on 13th January 2010. He was 29. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lost+Sounds">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
