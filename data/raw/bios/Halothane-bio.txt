Melodic metal from Rochester, NY.

Conceptualized in 2010, Halothane was originally the solo project of guitarist and vocalist Nicholas Burrell. The four-song EP "Dissension" was recorded and released in late 2012, and the band lineup solidified not long after with the addition of guitarist Josh Mason (Throne of Wilderness, Nazg√ªl, ex-Neotheist), drummer Bill Rotach and bassist Joe Rotach (both of Desekrator). Aggressive yet melodic and thought-provoking, Halothane unleashes a twin lead guitar assault over a hard-hitting, precision rhythm section. Halothane is currently writing new material for a tentative mid-2014 release. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Halothane">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
