Soul Dissolution is a Belgian band, founded by Jabawock and joined by vocalist Acharan in late 2012, as a side-project of L'Hiver en Deuil. Their music lies in the realm of (post) black metal, taking inspiration from bands such as Agalloch, Alcest, Drudkh, Forgotten Tomb, Raventale,...

After a first demo (Cold Rays and Grey Waves) in 2014, the band went on to record their debut album throughout the course of 2015, with the help of session drummer Forge Stone (Norse, Gods of Eden, ex-The Amenta). Entitled "Pale Distant Light", this album was released on CD by Throats Productions, in early 2016. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Soul+Dissolution">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
