D+ is an indie rock band based in Anacortes, Washington. Formed in 1997 by singer/guitarist Bret Lunsford and singers/multi-instrumentalists Karl Blau and Phil Elvrum, the band is perhaps best known for Lunsford's droll vocals and witty wordplay, and a minimalist, charmingly ramshackle sound. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/D%252B">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
