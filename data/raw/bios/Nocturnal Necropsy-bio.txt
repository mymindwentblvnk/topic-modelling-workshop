This is a Black Metal/Ambient project formed by Lord Uhriel of Desecrated Grave and Asmoragoth of Paraphrenia (used to be called Skog). This project was actually the first to be created, a few years before Desecrated Grave or Paraphrenia.

Nocturnal Necropsy's style has changed since the demo, there are two splits to be released this year and on the later of the two, and even more clearly so on the upcoming full-length, the style is "Dark Experimental" (which is an infusion of Black Metal, Ambient, Doom, Darkwave, Free Jazz, Experimental, Noise, etc.) <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nocturnal+Necropsy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
