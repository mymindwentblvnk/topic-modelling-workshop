The band started in 2002 and after 4 years of hard work they've released the firt demo named "Pris√µes Sem Muros" in 2006, showing clear influences of melodic and progressive metal. The first album came in 2006 and the name is "Angels and Shadows". After playing in a really great event in 2008, the band stopped playing and in 2010 Menahem went back on track with a new lineup and the promise of a great album, plus many concerts to spread the new release. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Menahem">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
