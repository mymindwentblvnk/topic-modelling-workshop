In summer 2010 lead singer Johnny La Bomba and  Shredmaster JB (better known as Jens Basten, guitarist/songwriter in Night in Gales)  hooked up to live out their inmost desire since they grew up with bands like Iron Maiden, Thin Lizzy, Judas Priest and Manowar. They founded Gloryful.

Their first effort "Sedna's Revenge" (3-track demo) gained them high reputation among the classic Heavy Metal underground. Gloryful played numerous shows with bands like Powerwolf, Vicious Rumors, Ordan Ogan and Helstar and left screaming  crowds longing for their debut album.

As a full line-up consisting of advanced and professional musicians like Vito Papotto (g), Oliver Karasch (b) and Hartmut Stoof (d), they entered the studio in 2012 to record their debut album "The Warrior's Code" and chose legendary Swedish sound alchemist Dan Swanö as their producer.

Gloryful's music is not about any clichés or bullshit. It's just what it is: Heavy Metal, and this is more than meets the eye!

Their debut album will be released in summer 2013 via Massacre Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gloryful">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
