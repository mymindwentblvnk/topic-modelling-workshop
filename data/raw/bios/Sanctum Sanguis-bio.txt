In the middle of 2006, the project Sanctum Sanguis was created by Draug himself but was on hold for a while.

In January 2007, he brought the project back in life and he let the the vocalist Avernus into the band.

Summer 2007, the demo Nothing Prevails was recorded and released by Satanic Propaganda Records and shortly after, Tenebra Perpetua was created, which will be released in summer 2008.

Sanctum Sanguis is now working on the full-length album DCLXVI, more info will come. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sanctum+Sanguis">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
