In the fall of 2005, Nordvang (Erlend Antonsen) and Lars Jensen formed a nameless project for expressing their fondness for the more avantgarde side of symphonic metal. 
Originally it was thought to be a quick affair consisting of a demo with two or three songs. 
Nordvang would write all the music and lyrics whilst Lars would do all the vocals.
Turns out that once the creative process was started, there was no stopping it. 
So after the first four songs was written, the decision was made to make a complete album and four additional songs were written. 
At about the same time, the project was given a name: Quadrivium
In early 2006, Decepticon (Svein-Ivar Sarassen) was recruited to play the bass on the album.
The EP Origo was finally mixed and mastered in Sjaaen Studios on March 12.
