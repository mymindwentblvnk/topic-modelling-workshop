Humanasaur's sound is powerfully crushing and heavy, meandering  through (and scoffing at) tuning and time just enough have a primitive and casual feel without becoming messy.  While the music is rather plodding and sludgy, they do pick up the pace from time to time and manage to shake off some the thick ooze that surrounds them.  In addition to the occasional "upbeat" and thinner sounding songs, many of their tracks contain an undeniably poppy hook buried far behind the wall of feedback and noise.  The vocals have a sparse feel, seemingly drifting in and out, though always proving to be intense and tearing, laden with genuine emotion and strongly in conversation with the rest of the sound.  Upon careful inspection, many layers of carefully placed sound-identities can be heard contributing to the densely complicated, yet neanderthalian sonic thickness.  This band is effective on a somatic level, moving its listener from a very real and human place which has been obscured by evolution and modern pop music's obsession with escapism and alienation. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Humanasaur">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
