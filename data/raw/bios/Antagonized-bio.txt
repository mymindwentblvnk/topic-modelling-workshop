Antagonized it´s a Death Metal band from Panamá city, Panamá. 
 It was founded by ForstAldst in December 2006. The band´s concept is based in a ideology contrary to all other ideologies, parameters and values established as right by mankind. The lyrics are based in human behavior which by its own perverse nature it’s not understood by the rest of the humans; it also makes allusion to extreme experiences and situations that make some subjects commit unimaginable acts, this thanks to their most obscure instincts.
 From 2006 to 2008 Antagonized is dedicated to play in different metal events in their own country.
 During 2008 they travel to San José, Costa Rica to attempt to record in Cavan Studios an EP known as “Empyrean Abbadon”, unfortunately it´s not achieved completely. 
 The band changes it´s alignment between the end of 2008 and the beginning of 2009 leaving ForstAldst as only original member of the band. Thorvik and Latz incorporate in 2009 (bass and guitar respectively), but still leaving a whole in the drums. In the coming months Forst meets Alex Marquez, ex drummer of bands such as Malevolent Creation, Demolition Hammer, Resurrection and Solstice, and they invite him to record with them their debut album “Intense Pervertion”. Marquez collaborates with the composition of 2 tracks in the album. 
 The recording process starts in April 2009 and finishes in October 2009.
 Antagonized participates in San José´s Costa Rica “Bone Breaker Festival 2” in August 2009, receiving good acceptance from the crowd.
 Intense Perversion´s album mastering in “Insomnio Studios” concludes in March 2010 and it´s released by the end of April 2010. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/antagonized">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
