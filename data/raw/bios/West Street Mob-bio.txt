West Street Mob, formed in New York, USA, in the late 70s, were one of the less celebrated of Sugarhill Records' acts, despite the fact that Sugarhill owners Joe and Sylvia Robinson's son, Joey Jnr., was once a member. Their most significant release was 1983's electro classic "Break Dancin' - Electric Boogie", a version of the Incredible Bongo Band's interpretation of the Shadows' "Apache". This "break" had long been a staple of the scratch mix DJs within the hip-hop community, and its familiarity was an important factor in its local popularity. Their only two Billboard Top 100 hits were "Let's Dance (Make Your Body Move)" and "Sing A Simple Song", in September 1981 and April 1982 respectively. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/West+Street+Mob">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
