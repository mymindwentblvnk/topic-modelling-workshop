The genre-crossing metal ensemble UNSOUL hails from the noisy streets of Berlin. Maybe that..s the place from where they draw the inspirations for their enigmatic and complex compositions. The five young guys formed UNSOUL in 2003 to express their own vision of ultimate heaviness. They use metal as the shaping force of their music but enrich it with loads of weird ideas that leave the listener suprised and fascinated. UNSOULs breathtaking live performances are a true experience and their monumental style clashes unfold their subversive energy the best in a live situation. So don't miss them. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Unsoul">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
