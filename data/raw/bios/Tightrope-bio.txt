Meet Tightrope. Straight out of Montreal, Quebec, Canada, they play an energetic, punk/hardcore hybrid. Somewhat reminiscent of another local band, The Sainte Catherines, these youngsters are off to an amazing start after forming not that long ago in October 2009. The band has released one three-song demo, and just recorded their first self-titled EP, which will be released on vinyl through Big Wheel Records in May 2011.
