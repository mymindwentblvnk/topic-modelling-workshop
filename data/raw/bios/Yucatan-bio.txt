Yucatan was formed in 2006 by Dilwyn Llwyd, with a view of creating abstract, epic music. In 2007, Yucatan released its self-titled debut album, recorded at Sigur Ros’ studio to considerable praise from critics. 

The album has been described as “stunning music from a special place” by Radio One's Huw Stephens.

Yucatan has performed in a variety of festivals and gigs. Their highlight was playing three stages in the National Eisteddfod of Wales 2007-one of Europe's largest and oldest cultural festivals. They also played on two stages at the Gwyl Macs Festival 2007, a festival of contemporary music, as well as Yucatan’s own festival, Gwyl Gardd Goll 2007, situated in an amphitheatre amidst historic gardens. As well as festivals, Yucatan has played in the Taith Tafod tour of Wales 2007, and performed various individual gigs around Wales. Yucatan plans on touring extensively throughout the UK and Europe in 2008, and plans to release its second album in 2008.
