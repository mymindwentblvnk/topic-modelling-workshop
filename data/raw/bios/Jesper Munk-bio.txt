Jesper Munk (born 31 May 1992 in Munich) is a German blues, rock and soul musician.

Eighteen months after the release of his highly acclaimed debut album, Munk's second: CLAIM, a musical journey from Los Angeles via New York to Munich and the more rural surroundings of Niederding. This time Munk spent time with the producers Mocky (Feist, Jamie Lidell), Jon Spencer (Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, Heavy Trash, Pussy Galore) and Sepalot (Blumentopf), who bring new enhanced features to his work, along with his own productions. He has extended his spectrum as a singer, songwriter and guitarist with 14 exciting songs from Rock, Postpunk and Glam to Folk and Soul without ignoring his Blues beginnings. This variety is held together as a matter of course by Jesper’s extraordinary voice, which has never before been heard in such intensity. “CLAIM” brings the listener into the musical world of a young man who wears his heart on his vocal cords. 
 
Time flew by for Jesper Munk. While still singing as a street musician, he was discovered through radio and hailed as a “Wunderkind” with a voice from the Mississippi Delta and pin up looks. His career took off. The first album “For In My Way It Lies” attracted rave reviews from audiences and media alike and led to three solo tours through Germany plus supports for legends such as Michael Hurley, Willard Grant Conspiracy and Eric Burdon & the Animals as well as top German acts such as Saint Lu, Bosse and Sportfreunde Stiller. The 22 year-old Danish-German almost single handedly made Blues and his style of playing popular for a new generation in Germany. It now seems hardly surprising that the music press soon made comparisons with the likes of Jack White, The Black Keys and Gary Clark Jr.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jesper+Munk">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
