1) NYMPH is a Brooklyn-based psychedelic/avant-garde group whose tempestuously transcendent music has been penetrating the New York music scene with bared teeth.  NYMPH’S compositional palette encompasses a kaleidoscope of sound: imagine 13th Floor Elevators essaying a Rahsaan Roland Kirk jam and you begin to get the picture. Or maybe Steve Reich bonging out on Pandit Pran Nath and jamming with This Heat. The four-piece’s orgiastic din is composed and orchestrated by the nucleus of Matty McDermott (formerly of Coyote – Birdman Records) and Eri Shoji; and currently featuring the thundering harmonic prowess of bassist Nickle Emmet, with Jason Robira (Dark Meat) pounding the skins.

2) Russian indie-band from Khabarovsk. Sounds like britpop, indie, alt, etc.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nymph">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
