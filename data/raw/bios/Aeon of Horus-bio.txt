Forming in Canberra Australia in 2006, Aeon of Horus craft a unique brand of progressive metal. Thoughtful rhythmic complexity and modern guitar technicality cross paths with electronic, symphonic and ambient sounds begging a contrast of styles unique to the Australian quintet. Pulsating with blatant energy, yet subtle and creative in ways beyond their metal origins, Aeon of Horus provide the new sound of Australian metal.

Aeon of Horus have releases to date; Aeon of Horus EP (2006), The Embodiment of Darkness and Light full length (2009) and the EXILE EP (2011). The latter two release have been met with critical acclaim both in their home country and on the international stage.

In late 2012 Aeon of Horus entered the The Brain Studios in Sydney with engineer Clayton Segelov to record their sophomore full-length entitled 'Existence'. The forthcoming release, to be mixed and mastered by Jochem Jacobs (Textures, The Red Shore) will manifest the band’s unrelenting focused vision; an epic sensory experience, crushing with intensity and technicality but focused and thought-provoking.

TheMetalinquisition.com claimed that Aeon of Horus has the ability to take the metal world by storm. PowerPlay Magazine (UK) proclaimed the band as ‘some of the best death metal we’ve heard in a long time’. What is clear is that Aeon of Horus have a unique vision and show no signs of slowing in it's pursuit. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Aeon+Of+Horus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
