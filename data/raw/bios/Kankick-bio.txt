The Kankick sound is dusty, crunchy and blunted, and just the right tempo to get the proper head nod going. He started out in the science of hip-hop beat making in 1988, as a freshman in high school when he hooked up with Madlib who was a sophomore at the time. Kankick later joined the Lootpack and became the 4th member. He has now split from them though and formed the Funk Farm, which also included DJ Babu (Dilated Peoples/Beat Junkies).
