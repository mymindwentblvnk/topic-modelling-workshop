Screaming Into The Abyss is Arizona guitarist Vince LuPone's first full-length album, and the eight heavy metal instrumental tracks and three vocal numbers absolutely scream for vengeance. LuPone rolls influences such as Joe Satriani, Dream Theater, Metallica, Steve Vai, Deep Purple and Fear Factory into his throbbingly energetic, self-produced, one-man band creations, and take note to what the folks at sevenstring.org had to say, "Screaming Into The Abyss isn't a shred album, nor a fusion album, nor a run of the mill prog guitar album - it's all of the above and a lot more. Most impressively, it never once feels like it's doing 'something different' for the sake of being different. The whole album flows from beginning to end without feeling as though you're listening to 'A prog guitarist playing a slow tune', or 'A rock guitarist playing in offtime'. Quite simply put, Vince LuPone's album is a seamless array of well written, well played and extremely versatile tracks that run the gambit between moving melodies and aggressive chaos."
