Biography
Afflicted Creation started out under the name Battery, and played Metallica covers without vocals. Later, the band got a vocalist and changed their name to Fractured. As Fractured they covered songs from several different artists. In August 2011 the band changed their name again, to the dissonant. This was important because they had developed their own style and become comfortable within the metal genre. Then the band finally changed their name to Afflicted Creation. Afflicted Creation play a good mix of Death / Grindcore with input of Groove metal. This makes the music interesting and different. The band works hard with their music and try to create music that is different and unique. Afflicted Creation makes the music that they think sound good and works best for them.
