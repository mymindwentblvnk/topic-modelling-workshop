Hailing from America’s heartland, the Kansas City metal outfit known as Hester Prynne has stirred up quite a bit of attention in the underground metal scene since their beginning in 2007. 
  First hitting the scene with the internet leak of their self-produced EP "Brothel" in 2008, Hester Prynne found themselves quickly recognized among their peers and labels alike. In fact, it was later that same year HP saw the offers on the table and made the decision to sign on with Torque Records with worldwide distribution deal through Victory Records. In just a few months time following the signing, HP hit the studio to record their first label release, wasting no time in putting together what would later be addressed by many online metal zines and reviews as “one of the top underground metal albums of 2009”. With the undaunted success of their debut full length, (holding top 100 sales charts on both Smartpunk.com and Interpunk.com for over three months) “The Goswell Divorce”, the group had now achieved a respectable name worldwide, and have kept stead-fast in making that recognition flourish ever since. 
  Quickly building their musical resume in their years as a band, HP has shared the stage with a slew of notable acts ranging from The Black Dahlia Murder to Every Time I Die, and toured states coast-to-coast on their national reign of musical terror. With the nation's attention under their belt, along-side the worldwide release of "The Goswell Divorce", the band has now attained notoriety the world across. It's safe to say that if you haven't heard of Hester Prynne before, your time is soon to come. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hester+Prynne">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
