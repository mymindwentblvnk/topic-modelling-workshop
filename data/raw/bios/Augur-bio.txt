There is more than one artist with this name:

1) Heavy metal band.

2) Experimental ambient project.

1) Augur combine heavy yet catchy riffing, brutally precise drumming, laden with deep, guttural, growling vocals. With a solid line-up and an assortment of material, they have assaulted the local live scene with intense shows and a signature sound. Augur completed their first studio release, the three-track demo Origins, in early 2007.

Augur, then un-named, had its musical beginnings in late 2003 when guitarist Ben Graham and bassist Ross Kidson began writing material. After a short period with the now-Be'lakor drummer Jimmy Vanden Broeck, Augur recruited current skins-man Graeme Brown and second guitarist Karl Easey. Augur spent much of 2006 searching for a vocalist who could step up to the demanding task set by the band, a position filled in late 2006 by vocalist/dominator Gary Sansom. Within a month of completing the lineup, Augur had unleashed its signature mix of metal onto the live scene.

2) Ambient experimental project of Steve Brand using an array of objects and field recordings as sound sources. Released on Alluvial Records, among others. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/augur">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
