Rogue Planet is:

Henrik M. Arnesen - Vocals/Guitar
Vegard Hermstad - Guitar
Åge Breivik - Drums
Kristian Hindbjørgen - Bass

Formation: (2015)

Rogue Planet started as a side project of Henrik M. Arnesen, Åge Breivik and Vegard Hermstad from the epic doom band Summit. Henrik wanted to channel the stoner part of Summit’s sound into a new band. They were joined by Kristian Hindbjørgen (Funeral Harvest and Polygenic) on bass. From this, Rogue Planet was formed as an outlet for this heavier and more rhythmical style. 

Cosmic journey: (2015-Present)

The band had a hectic first year in existence. They had their debut concert supporting Dunbarrow, Summit and Skarv under Henrik’s concert concept: Nidarosdoomen. Rogue Planet recorded their first demo, a two-track release containing the songs Rogue Planet and Heat Death. The band has since continued to play concerts at a regular basis. Some of the bands that Rogue Planet has played support for include: Superlynx, Red Mountains, Kal-El, and Black Moon Circle. There is currently plans for an EP in the not too distant future. In the meantime they are looking forward to performing their cosmic ritual on more stages. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rogue+Planet">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
