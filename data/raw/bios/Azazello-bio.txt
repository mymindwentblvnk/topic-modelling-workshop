Formerly a thrash-death metal band known as MORG (as in “Morgue”), the members of Russian prog band AZAZELLO had some fun shocking pop audiences in the early 90's and then completely reinvented themselves. In fact, through the course of three albums, they have almost completely abandoned the metal genre for some truly progressive endeavours. Despite the English title tracks, they sing in Russian (although 90% of their repertoire is strictly instrumental).

They are led by vocalist, guitarist and arranger Alexander Kulak who also composes most of the material.
