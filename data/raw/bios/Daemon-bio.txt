3) Daemon is also the alternate musical handle of Monster-0's Daemon Hatfield who makes pastoral electronica on his home computer. His first album, Background Processes, is a collection of songs written from 2003-2009. Several tracks were commissioned for theatre and film projects, but others haven't been heard anywhere before. Daemon tries to make the biggest emotional impact possible with the least amount of musical elements, resulting in simple electronic lullabies.
