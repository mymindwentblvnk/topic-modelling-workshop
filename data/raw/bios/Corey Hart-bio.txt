Corey Mitchell Hart (born 31 May 1962, in Montreal, Canada) is a Canadian musician.

Hart became an instant hit with his rebellious looks, and his first album released in 1983 First Offense, featuring the hit song Sunglasses at Night. The album sold well in both Canada and the United States. The follow-up album was Boy in the Box in 1985, another very successful album featuring the song Never Surrender, which would be his highest-charting single. Hart would continue to record music, but his commercial success was significantly reduced after Box.

Today, Hart lives in the Bahamas with his wife, musician Julie Masse, and their four children.
