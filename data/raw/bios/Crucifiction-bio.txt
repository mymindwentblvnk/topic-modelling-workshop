Crucifiction is a death metal abomination evoked from spheres beyond the gates of nine angles to the mundane reality of the human world.
Spawned in the wretched underground of Athens 2000 years after the birth of the Nazarene liar and invoking full power in their ranks by the year 2002, they denounced the power of his church with their demo “Crucified with Horns” unleashed in 2003.
Underground cultists received this sacrifice with enthusiasm, and this defeat of Christ opened the way for more unholy abominations to emerge from the deep darkness of the void. But not until the stars were right…
After years of slumber, reanimation and transformation, Crucifiction was summoned back to the black earth in the year 2008. Obssessed and tormented by unspeakable visions, they constructed 11 new blasphemies which were recorded after a one-year period of morbid rehearsing.
In the same time and space, Crucifiction entered an alliance with the label Cryptia Productions, renewing their covenant with the Athenian Underground.
December 9, 2010 was the day of darkness, when the debut album "Portals to the Beyond" was finally unleashed from beyond the world of horrors.
The Old Ones roar out of their cosmic desolation as their tentacles reach out to this fragile world with ravaging wrath.
