EMORTUS was created by 3 friends, Ian Rittmaster, Tony Marsili, and Klayton Kraft. They soon found bass player, Geoff Holloway and later on found Northern California's own vocalist, Scott Gonzales. EMORTUS is a revolutionary 5-piece satanic death metal band, looking to elucidate the meaning of TRUE DEATH METAL in a world obscured by fakes and posers who do nothing but give death metal a bad name. EMORTUS currently has 2 releases, The Infernal Assault (2007) and Promo 2008. Emortus has announced their debut Full-Length, Diatribe, which they have already begun to record. More news will be posted on their myspace as it comes. In the name of all that is unholy and evil, EMORTUS shreds mind-blowing technical blackened brutality, spreading the blasphemy and defiance of Christianity to the open ears of the Bay Area, and the world, soon enough.
HAIL SATAN!!!
