"The Ride" is the first solo album from Athelstan of Forefather  comprised of 2 vocalized* and 5 instrumental tracks. The music was written between 2010 and 2012, with the exception of "Enchantment (Bewitched)", written and partly recorded way back in 1999. "Hero on the Hill" is Athelstan's adaptation of the ancient English tune "Bryd One Brere", put to new lyrics inspired by the enigmatic and mysterious "Longman" chalk figure carved into the Sussex downs. The Longman also provides the main theme of the artwork, driven by the cover art of illustrator Alexi Francis. The album is a category free "Ride" through the musical mindscape of its creator.
