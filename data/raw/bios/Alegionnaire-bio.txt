Sharing the stage with doom metal titans Zoroaster, Bongripper, Dark Castle and hooking up with Savannah,GA's swamp rockers Black Tusk for a couple of shows.

Alegionnaire bassist Aaron T. has created a solo/collaborative project entitled Audible Burst. Other guitarist Phil C. has took the time away from Alegionnaire to further progress his solo/acoustic workings.
