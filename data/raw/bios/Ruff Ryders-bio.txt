Ruff Ryders Entertainment is a New York City-based record label and management company, specializing in hip-hop music. It was founded in 1988 by Chivon Dean and her brothers Dee and Waah.

Ruff Ryders' founders were initially famous for managing rapper DMX, who became a multi-platinum star for Def Jam Records in the late-1990s. After DMX's success, the management company started its own label imprint through Interscope Records, and had success with releases from female rapper Eve, former Bad Boy Records group The LOX (consisting of its main rapper Jadakiss), Drag-On, and newcomer Jin, winner of BET's "106 & Park" freestyle MC battle competition. The Deans' nephew Swizz Beatz is the main producer for most of the acts on the roster.

As of 2006 the roster is:
Kartoon
Aja
Drag-On
Jadakiss
Styles P.
D-Block (Styles P, Jadakiss, Sheek Louch & J-Hood)
Flashy
Sheek Louch
Infa Rad & Cross
Devilz Son

Recently, Jadakiss and Styles P have announced that they are going to depart from the label and probably sign with Def Jam. The rest of D-Block (J-Hood) are signed to D-Block Records under Koch.
