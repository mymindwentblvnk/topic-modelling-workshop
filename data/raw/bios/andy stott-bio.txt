Manchester, England-based  Dj/producer Andy Stott is a purveyor of smudged and introspective dub techno with an approach that favours leaden tempos and unsettling, sample-based textures. 
in 2011, Stott released two full-length albums, Passed Me By and We Stay Together, both of which received attention from Pitchfork.com and other noteworthy music blogs.
