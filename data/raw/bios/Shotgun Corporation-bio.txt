The Heavy-metal band Shotgun Corporation (Shot Corp) came to life in the middle of 2004 under the name “Hellcome”, which was used until the end of 2008 and was replaced as soon as the band found out that there was another band with the same name. The band was formed by João Pedro Alcantara (Guitars) and Hugo Morelato (Drums). Now, besides the two founders, the band is composed by Kim Soares (vocals), Square (Bass) and César Schroeder (Guitars).
Many live performances happened during the four years of the Hellcome era, some of them in important clubs of the genre (Anchietinha, Caverna do Simpson, Porto Pirata, Teachers’ Pub, UFES, Yard Of Rock and etc.)
The band always presented set lists full of songs written by them and almost no cover songs, which was a very positive point as far as the audiences respected the work. Some rehearsal recordings were available in the band’s old myspace; having a positive repercussion they were the fuel for the band to start the recording sessions for their demo material which contains five Shot Corp’s heavy tunes. In 2010 The band is releasing Singles ("Beware Of The Leech", "The Way Things Are", "Skull Against Concrete" and "Nothing Stops The Bullet") and preparing their Debut album.
In musical terms, Shot Corp shows straight-to-the-point songs with real-theme lyrics that talk about corruption, greed, society and mental and individual struggles.
Shotgun Corporation was selected to Play 2010's Wacken Metal Battle, In ES, Brazil. The band won the Battle and played The Semi-Finals in SP - Brazil.
