Norhod were born in the summer 2009, with Michele Tolomei (keyboards), Giacomo Casa (growl), Giacomo Vannucci (guitars) and Andrea Stefani (guitars).

The band was committed entirely in composing their own songs with the idea of creating the first demo, but for almost two years since the birth of the project Norhod had a lot of lineup changes.
Finally in 2011 they reach a stable lineup with the arrival of Francesco Aytano (drums), Matteo Giusti (bass) and Clara Ceccarelli (vocals) and with these components Norhod were able to record their first EP completely self-produced: "Arianrhod", released in march 2012.

The EP soon arouses the interest from the producer Wahoomi Corvi and the from the label Wormhole Death.
Ended up the writing process of their first full-lenght they finally sign the contract and enter at the Realsuond Studio in Parma (Italy) to record "The Blazing Lily" (produced by Norhod & Wahoomi Corvi, mixed by Wahoomi Corvi, Mastered by Mika Jussila (Finnovox Studios)) which will be released the 10th semptember in digital version and on 7th october worldwide <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Norhod">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
