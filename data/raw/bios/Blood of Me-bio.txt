Saint Louis based metal act "Blood of Me" has been dropping jaws and mopping blood off the walls for most of the twenty-first century. They have provided st. louis support for Veil of Maya, Emmure, A Life Once Lost , The Faceless, Despised Icon, Suicide Silence, The Ton...y Danza Tapdance Extravaganza Oceano, Evergreen Terrace, and Killah Priest from the (WU TANG KLAN) just to name a few. Since their inception, they have been formulating some of the heaviest, abrasive and brutal music to ever come from any underground scene. Originally formed in a moldy and mildew-ridden basement in Festus, MO. just south of St.Louis, Blood of Me has always been a crued, strange home brew, trailer court chemistry, of sorts. However, they have been described as everything from hardcore to grind-core and anything in between. Hard work and perseverance culminated in the late 2006 release of their debut album "Gracefulness is Lost" independently produced without any label backing what so ever and it has met the industry's standards, to say the least. Receiving a very favorable review from Andrew Bonazilla, managing editor of Decibel Magazine (Oct 2006 issue pg.94) as well as having recieved airplay on Sirius' Hard Attack and several clear channel stations from Seattle to Connecticut. Recorded at Jupiter Studios in St. Louis, MO. with top engineer Jim Callahan who has worked with such acts as Vampire Mooose, Story of the Year, Nelly, and Murphy Lee, Gracefulness is Lost pulls few punches when it comes to the ruff and tumble. It is well beyond what you would call in your face, to tell you the truth, it's bordering upon in your ass. One thing is for sure, the metal world will have to deal with Blood of Me because what they are about isn't going to let you ignore it." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Blood+of+Me">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
