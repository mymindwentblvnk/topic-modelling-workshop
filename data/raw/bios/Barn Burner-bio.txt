With the volume, technicality and intensity that embodies heavy metal and the overarching catchiness and longevity of stoner and classic rock, Barn Burner capture a signature sound that cannot be easily placed or categorized. Cultivating the principles of partying and the ever lasting might of the riff, Barn Burner create a live atmosphere that render an audience incapable of standing still.
   Whether it is giving your best friend a well-deserved swill of beer or lovingly smashing the bottle over his head to the sound of a ruthless riff, Barn Burner will fulfill the demands of its listeners.
   The recent release of their full-length record entitled Bangers saw Barn Burner team up with producer/engineer Adrian Popovich (Tricky Woo, Priestess, Sam Roberts, The Dears, and Sebastian Grainger) to create a truly original heavy metal record, while having already toured Canada with the likes of Priestess, Bison B.C., and Lords.
