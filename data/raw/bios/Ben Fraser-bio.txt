After 12 years playing the drums, culminating in an album deal with Swiss punk band Tastes Like Chicken (now BMC), Sheffield-based Ben Fraser now focuses his efforts on creating high-quality late-night entertainment...

This takes the form of swarming, precision-made pleasure machines: the unique driving acid-tinged filth that is the Ben Fraser sound.

Since his first release on Planet Zogg Records in 2005, Ben has gone on to set-up Sabretooth Records: an outlet for his unique blend of all things deep, dark and driving. Ben has also taken his livePA all around the UK, and more recently abroad, with devastating effects at many top underground clubs- his resident’s slot at Planet Zogg (Sheffield), Underground City (Birmingham), Neuroshocked (Szczecin, Poland), Ripsnorter (Bristol), Riff Raff (Leeds), Sunrise (Manchester), Absurd Grooves (Krakow, Poland), Cabbage (Leeds), Psycle (Nottingham), Shamania Festival and so on. His commitment to live performance has recently seen him develop a set based around improvised percussion, bringing a fury of punk-style drumming to Ben’s already energetic shows.

Ben has also turned his production skills to an exciting full-on psy trance project, simply named Sabretooth. This is an opportunity for him to build on his long-standing love of Goa trance, to create a purer and slicker version of his driving sound.
