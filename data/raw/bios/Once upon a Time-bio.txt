: "Once Upon a Time is a quest project about the cosmic energy which electronic music can offer to dance floor travellers ... "
... These sonic fairytale soundscapes flow across a sea of Deep, Dark and melodic Psychedelic atmospheres, using cinematic blends and organic elements with a pumping Psychedelic Trance rhythm ... "They drive you through a tunnel of lights and shadows, depths and peaks, eerie and magical"

~ Kliments' Psytrance project is geared towards the early evening or morning dancefloor.

~ His debut album with this project : The Book of Mirrors is out on Blue Hour Sounds and can be found on Bandcamp/Beatspace here : http://beatspace-bluehoursounds.bandcamp.com/album/once-upon-a-time-the-book-of-mirrors-blue-hour-sounds
