Narghazar is a black metal band from Jyväskylä, Finland. Narghazar was formed in 2005 by Mors (guitars and vocals) and Bargaroth (bass). Narghazar was back then known as Morgoth. Soon Thyrsaras (keyboards) and Nargyrth (drums) joined the band. After few months they heard that the name Morgoth was taken. Narghazar died for some time and rose again at 6th June 2006 under the name Narghazar. Soon Thyrsaras and Bargaroth were kicked out of the band because they had disagreements with the music. Soon Xirit Astractus (bass) joined Narghazar. After a year Nargyrth and Xirit left the band because they didn't keep black metal developing music style. Soon after Balberith (drums) joined the band. Narghazar retired and Balberith left the band because of his bad playing skills.
After that Xirit Astractus (drums) joined Narghazar again and swore eternal loyalty to Narghazar. 2nd June 2007 Zuryr Ragraz (bass) joined Narghazar but were soon kicked out.
