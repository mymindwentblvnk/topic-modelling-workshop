POSTMORTEM - DEATH METAL - BRAZIL

The band was formed in 2004 when the brothers Bruno and Daniel Añaña wanted to create a death/thrash metal band. Soon they met Douglas Veiga and Willian Knuth. Back in that time, the band was called Wargod with this line up: Willian Knuth (vocals), Bruno Añaña (guitars), Douglas Veiga (drums) and Daniel Añaña (bass), but after the debut gig they change the name to Postmortem, a tribute to the thrash metal masters Slayer. 
After that, Daniel had to quit the band and Matheus Heres replace his bass duties and the group focused his musical creations to the death metal genre. Later Willian moved to another town and left the band, then Bruno assumed the vocals and a second guitar player joined the death metal assault, Mou Machado. The band gained heaviness and extreme power with these changes, which can be heard on the first demo cd, “OUT OF TOMB”, recorded at the ELECTRIC STUDIOS, between 2006/2007 in Pelotas/RS, south of Brazil. 
Now they spread his music across the death metal scene and seek for a record / distribution label. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Postmortem">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
