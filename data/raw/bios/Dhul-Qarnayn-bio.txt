The abomination came to life through the focus of one man's black aura within the wastelands of Bahrain, Learza "Omar A." the mastermind behind Dhul-Qarnayn formed the putrid and vile shrine of evil within the year 2006, after the demise of former project "Qeyamah" which means resurrection of the dead at the time of armageddon. Dhul-Qarnayn is an Arabic phrase which was first given to a tyrant king, but later on has been demonized in reference to the horned master, a variety of diverse meanings come from the term, such as "he of the two horns" ,"he of two generations", "he of two centuries", "he of two kingdoms". There have been a few members associated with the project aswell, but have later been kicked out due to their pityful intentions and their alternate lives, later on Learza decided that Dhul-Qarnayn mainly become a blood and soulpact between Satan and he, at which would share no other weak beings of frail contamination to interfere. The impure revelations have been put through a raw form of Black Metal conveniant for the extreme self-expression to take shape. Death, blood, hate, torment, reality, misanthropy, and devotion concuct the ritualism.
