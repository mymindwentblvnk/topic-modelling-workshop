Cast The Stone is a death metal band formed in 2002 in Saint Louis, Missouri, US. Cryptic and writhing, Cast the Stone has bled their way to the surface of this oblivion. Pulling out all the boundaries between metal styles, Cast the Stone is sure to please any type of headbanger. Mark Kloeppel (Misery Index/Criminal Element), Jesse Shobel, and Derek Engemann (Unmerciful, Christ Hate) have created a group with a tastefully diverse mixture of Old and New School American Metal, combined with a touch of European Black metal; all without comprimising their musical integrity. The final product is a highly intense stage performance, converying an image of strength and metal purity, with sound much much bigger than a three-piece should be able to achieve. Cast the Stone has played with bands as heavy as Lamb of God, Chimaira, Anthrax, God Forbid, Dying Fetus, Goatwhore, Origin, Full Blown Chaos, Malomar, and more. Cast the Stone will be tearing a club down near you. See you in the pit. For more info go to http://www.myspace.com/castthestoneband
