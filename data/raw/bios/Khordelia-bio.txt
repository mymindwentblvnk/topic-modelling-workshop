Khordelia is a Trip-Hop artist from London.
Not much else is known about Khordelia. Mainly due to the fact his identity is completely unknown.

While he sticks to the shadows, what has come to light is his music.
Since releasing his debut album online in February of 2014, it took just a month before he attained his first BBC radio play, in which ‘Love To Love Her’ was featured as 'Record Of The Week'.

Other than posting new material or announcing show dates, very rarely does he update his social media sites.
Only a few pictures of Khordelia exist, but in each picture his face has been digitally distorted. When performing, he wears a mask.

Will he ever put an identity to his sound…? <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Khordelia">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
