We started our band in 2005 with 3 founding members, Dizzy on vocals, Filip aka Moses on guitar and Kris on drums.
Later on Frederick joined us on Bass.
For a few months, Tom played lead guitar. But he decided to leave the band for personal reasons.
In the beginning of 2007 Frederick decided to leave the band to have more time for his other 2 bands, Sanitarium and Herfst.
He was replaced by Yves in the spring of 2007.

At the end of 2007 we've recorded our first demo: Unit 731.
After recording our demo, Yves missed his guitar.

The band decided to get Dizzy a bass so Yves could play the guitar like he does in several other bands.
From now on Dizzy is singing and kicking the shit out of his bass.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Leave+Scars">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
