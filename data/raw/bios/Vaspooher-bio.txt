VASPoohER was formed in 19 July 2003 in Mashhad, Persia (Iran), by Hamidreza Alizadeh (also known as Ham, Guitars), along with Ali Ravari (Bass), Emad Lashgari (Guitars) and Aras Karimi (Drums). Soon after, Reza Nabizadeh (vocals) joined the band.
After two years of rocking and three live shows, Aras Karimi emigrated to United States. Few months later, a replacement was found in Saeed Shariat (Drums) from the band Azooma (now he plays in both bands). In the winter of 2007 Reza Nabizadeh left the band for personal reasons. In the fall of 2007, Hamid Shirazi (Bass) temporarily replaced Ali Ravari and in the summer of 2008, Shahin Vaqfipour (Vocals) temporarily joined the band to have some vocal incorporation. In the fall of 2008, VASPoohER played in MetalFront Fest in Armenia and few weeks later Emad Lashgari left the band and VASPoohER replaced him with Ali Shahpasand (Guitars).
