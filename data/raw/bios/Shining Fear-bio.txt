The Band began their journey in early 2004, when the vocalist Barbara Mischeri and guitarist Matteo Migliorini came up with an idea for a band that would channel their inspirations and abilities. thus, with Pierluigi Lazzarini as the brilliant mind behind the drum set, keyboardist Lorenzo Tomelleri and bassist Jacopo Ravagnani the lineup was complete, and Shining Fear, with a sound that is new, powerful and unmistakably theirs, was born.
     In February 2005 Shining Fear recorded their first demo, "Catch The Breathe", a gothic-oriented work in which both operatic vocals and the symphonic use of keyboards were used. Even though it was recorded in just 16 hours, the band considers it an honest work. "Catch The Breathe" received reviews by Metal Maniac, Rock Hard and other metal magazines. In the following years their sound evolved and became more aggressive and rough, and was influenced by a more broad spectrum of genres.
    In November 2008 Shining Fear recorded their first full-length album "ApocaLife", which includes 9 tracks noted for their heavy and aggressive sound. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Shining+Fear">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
