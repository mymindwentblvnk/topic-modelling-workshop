History

The band started out as a heavy metal band by two brothers; Ali Raza & M. Ali during early 1997. Before that it was called Metal Purge. As the genre of heavy metal became more popular through the years the band were able to work with various domestic media entities that increased the band's popularity locally and internationally. In 2007 the band set out to work independently from the local radio station because of lack of cooperation to promote metal from their side.
