The Skull Defekts is a two-headed beast from Sweden. One for hypnotic rock and one for experimental electronics. The band has been compared to Can, Wolf Eyes, Wire, Shellac and beyond. Formed by Henrik Rylander and Joachim Nordwall in early 2005 when Nordwall's band Kid Commando decided to end their eight-year career as knights of the sweatiest avant rock existing. Rylander had been experimenting with feedback for a few years after the death of the infamous Swedish garage rock outfit Union Carbide Productions where he was the pulse, rhythm and founding memeber. Quickly they teamed up with legend Jean-Louis Huhta, who's been a key character in the Swedish underground music scene since the mid 80's, and the quartet was complete when Daniel Fagerstr√∂m joined after Eric Olofsson left the band after the recording of Blood Spirits & Drums Are Singing. Inspired by bands like Section 25, Lungfish, Public Image Ltd., 23 Skidoo, Arthur Russell, Cabaret Voltaire, A Certain Ratio, Brain Bomb, dub, noise, funk, and tribal ritual drumming...The Skull Defekts are kings of their own sound.

"The Skull Defekts conjure up an unlikely and unkind meltdown din somewhere between the arid No Wave of CHARIS MISSING-preriod Wire, the contemporary ramalama of Sweden's excellent Krautrock-wannabees Audionon and the artless pummeling early-70s proto-Kiss proto-Cleveland blues-free white blues of Germany's Tiger B. Smith amped up to a heartless degree." Head Heritage(Britain)  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Skull+Defekts">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
