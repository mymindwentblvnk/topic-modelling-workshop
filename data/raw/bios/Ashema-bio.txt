Metallic beatdown hardcore from Limburg, Belgium, with ex-members of Personal Vendetta and Full Court Press. One MCD, 'In A Heartbeat' out on Genet Records. They started out with 2 singers, but after Roman quitted they decided to go on as a 4-piece.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ashema">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
