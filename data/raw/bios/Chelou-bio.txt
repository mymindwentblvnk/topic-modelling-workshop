A product of the Camden punk scene his parents were native to, Chelou is a 23 year old songwriter and producer. Emerging last year (2014) with a debut EP 'The Quiet', inspired by acts as diverse as PJ Harvey, Bon Iver and Lana Del Rey, Chelou quickly made a name for himself thanks to a host of strong support from the likes of Tom Ravenscroft, Guy Garvey and Lauren Laverne on BBC 6Music and Huw Stephens on BBC Radio 1. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Chelou">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
