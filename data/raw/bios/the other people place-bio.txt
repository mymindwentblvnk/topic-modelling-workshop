The Other People Place was a project produced by James Stinson, who was one half of Drexciya. In 2001 he released the album "Lifestyles Of The Laptop Caf√©", about a love born which prematurely ended. 

Born on September 14, 1969, James Marcel Stinson grew up on Detroit's east side and graduated from Kettering in 1989. He died September 3, 2002 of heart complications in Newnan, Georgia, where he had moved earlier that year for health reasons.

"After long talks on the internet she finally agreed to meet in real life. Eye contact was made. A simple kiss exchanged deep emotions, awoke peace of mind, confusion and love. People on the streets noticed and looked in awe. It's your love. Impressed, in a different city a moonlight rendezvous occured. She said she wanted me. She said i know what i want. Some days later the cavities of life reached out. Enough with that! Let me be what i wanna be. Suddenly she was gone. Was she running from his love? Gone? Back to earth, yet luckily there are the sunrays."
