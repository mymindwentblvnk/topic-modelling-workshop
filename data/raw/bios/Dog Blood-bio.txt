Dog Blood is a collaboration between Boys Noize and Skrillex.

Boys Noize, along with BNR, and Skrillex, along with his label OWSLA, have a new collab going down between two of the biggest dudes in electronic music.  Germany’s Boys Noize and Los Angeles’ Skrillex have teamed up to bring you quite a different sound.  On one hand, you have the master of techno and electro, Boys Noize, and then dubstep poster child Skrillex.  If you listen closely enough, you’ll hear their very distinctive sounds slowly forming together.  The bleeps, bloops and crazy techno sounding parts are without a doubt Boys Noize’s work, and the hard, bassy parts can be attributed to Skrillex. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dog+Blood">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
