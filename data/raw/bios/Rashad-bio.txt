The name Rashad (often styled as R∆§H∆Ð) may not jump out to you at first mention, but you’re probably already a fan of dude without realizing it. You may remember Ohio born singer/songwriter/producer for his work with his group The 3rd, his production work (as well as a few hooks) on Stalley‘s critically acclaimed release, Lincoln Way Nights, or some of his solo music. In 2012, R∆§H∆Ð released his debut LP, Museum. 

The 18 track release has features from Styles P and PA Flex with all the production handled by R∆§H∆Ð himself. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rashad">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
