The Dave Brubeck Quartet was an American modern jazz group formed in San Francisco in 1951 by jazz pianist Dave Brubeck (1920-2012). In what became known as the band's classic line-up, the band featured Joe Morello (1928–2011) on drums, Eugene Wright (1923-2020) on bass, and Paul Desmond (1924-1977) on saxophone.  The band remains best-known for their use of odd time signatures, and were a premier group in the cool jazz movement. They produced several standards, including Take Five and Blue Rondo à la Turk.

Throughout the years, and changing line-ups, the group maintained a strong fan-base among jazz fans of all ages. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Dave+Brubeck+Quartet">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
