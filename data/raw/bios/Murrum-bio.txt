Murrum is a Black/Death metal band out of Norwich, CT. They formed in early 2011 after Chaos Architect, (Mörg and Mistress' previous band), had fallen apart. They started the collaboration in an effort to bring the misunderstood and often outcast genre of black metal to the masses whilst incorporating crushing death metal riffing. Deriving their musical style from bands such as Hate Eternal, Marduk, and Sanctification, 1349, among others, they strive to keep their sound reminiscent of the True Black style whilst incorporating the structure and sound of Extreme Death Metal bands. Later on they would pick up drummer "Kabal" during the fall of that year, bringing an extremely dynamic feel to the band with his relentless blast beats and overall knowledge of the drums and Metal. They went on to play their first show as a band with California's "Abigail Williams" on Halloween of that year which happened to coincide with Mörg's 21st birthday. In late October 2012 Erebus and Kabal decided to leave the band to pursue music in a Tech-Death band and Mistress retired from music all together. Mörg and Heretic went on as the surviving members of Murrum and continue to write material.
