It was September of 1996 when the gears of the great doomsday machine called WORMWOOD: EARTH began to grind to life. This five piece from Northeast Tennessee combines Sabbath elements, fiery melodies and just plain grooooove to achieve their unique heavy sound. Coming from a variety of musical backgrounds, the line-up of WORMWOOD : EARTH experienced an almost instant chemistry between each individual's styles which immediately united the band to achieve one common goal: To play the music they love while eventually making the band self-sufficient. 

"To best describe their music, one could imagine a euphoric free-float through space and the cosmos as the sun conducts the stars to sing the orchestrations of Brahms just before a supernova suddenly explodes in your face." -T. Droke

In 2003 Wormwood Earth took a 6 year hiatus. In 2009 the band has regrouped and are now planning several shows in the Tri-City TN/VA area.
