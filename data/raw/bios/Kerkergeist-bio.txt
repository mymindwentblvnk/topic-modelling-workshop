Kerkergeist is the manifestation of cold residual evil billowing up forth from the depths of the lifeless chambers within the grand abyss. 

This is unholy Black Metal in the name of the Lord the Devil and for all of the vices, temptations, and chaos that His Hell giveth unto us. This is ritualistic devotion in his name.

Kerkergeist is the side project of Malédiction from Obscurité, Atrophia, and Sang Serpentin.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kerkergeist">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
