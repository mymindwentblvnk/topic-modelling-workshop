The name is new, but chances are youâ€™ve already heard Catz 'n Dogz. Previously, as 3 Channels, the best friend duo have already released red hot club records on some of the most respected underground dance labels in the world including Trapez, Crosstown Rebels, Pokerflat, Boxer, dirtybird, Leena, Trenton, and their own imprint, Channels Recordings. After making underground techno for many years, the duo have now ventured into new territory. This time, as Catz n' Dogz, the boys have headed towards deep house without losing sight of their harder techno roots - exploring lush organic soundscapes with live drums and instrumentation. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Catz+%27n+Dogz">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
