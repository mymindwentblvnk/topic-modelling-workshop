Baby Bash was born as Ronnie Ray Bryant on October 18, 1969 in Vallejo, California, USA. He had a Mexican mother and an Anglo father, both of whom went to prison when he was a child. He was raised by his grandmother and uncles and was subsequently exposed to many different kinds of music.

His career started when he joined the rap groups Potna Deuce and Latino Velvet out of Vallejo, but took off when he went to Houston, Texas, and met a rapper named South Park Mexican and joined the all-star group Lone Star Ridaz, which shortly after, added another Vallejo rapper known as Merciless (Funky Aztecs) AKA Merc100Man. His first solo album, Savage Dreams, was released on the Dope House Records independent label in 2001. He was signed by Universal Records later that year. In 2003, Baby Bash released his first album on a major label, entitled Tha Smokin' Nephew: Chopped & Screwed and followed it up with Super Saucy in 2005. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Baby+Bash">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
