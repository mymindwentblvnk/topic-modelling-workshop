Raw Nordic-influenced NS Black Metal of very controversial origin. This band has many many rumours surrounding it and still the truth is not fully known. Originally the band was thought to be a side project of Darkthule from Hellas, this has been pretty much proven to be false information. Then the project was linked to Wulfhere. One thing that has been confirmed is that it is definatley a US project and NOT Hellas as originally advertised.

Lyrical concepts surrounding this band deal in NS, Anti-judeo-christianity, Paganism and war.

So far the band has released one full length, an EP, two demos and a split. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Granulosum">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
