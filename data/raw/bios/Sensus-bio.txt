One man project Sensus leads to the area of electronic experimental music still more from the half of the 90ties. Influenced by many music styles, arts, nature and happening all around Sensus tries to mix together instrumental sounds, field recordings, his own recordings and synthetic sounds, in original or deformed form, with his own way. Accidentality is for Czech musician the important element of his work, enriching his music. So each track with its atmosphere, structure or BPM can be more or less similar to known electronic (or others) music styles or it wholly frees from them. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sensus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
