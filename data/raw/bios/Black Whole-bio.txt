First discovered in spring 2009 in Dresden,Germany, Black Whole quickly released considerable amounts of creative output, resulting in the manifestation of a demo-CD within its event horizon by July 2009. Black Whole shortly after began spreading and became visible to the naked eye. Being forced to a period of lower activity by the absence of some of its elementary particles, it took another year until Black Whole began to leave the confinement of Dresden to spread further in Saxony. Nobody can tell what the future of this object will be, but definitely it will grow further.
