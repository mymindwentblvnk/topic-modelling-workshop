Kampfar, formed in 1994, was born from the ashes of the mighty MOCK, in the early times of Norwegian Black Metal. The whole idea is to make music inspired by the nordic nature, folklores and myths. 'Kampfar' translates to Odin/Wodan. 
After releasing a demo in 1995, their first release was the self-titled EP Kampfar, by Season of Mist in 1996 followed by full length Mellom skogkledde aaser by Malicious Records in 1997. Being a studio band, without spending time on live shows or tours and with no intentions to slow down they released another EP Norse in 1998, and full length Fra underverdenen in 1999 both on Hammerheart Records. Then there were 7 years of studio silence although they began to play their first live shows in 2004.
Signing to Napalm records, they released three full length albums on that label: Kvass (2006), Heimgang (2008), & Mare (2011). All were well received by critics and listeners alike. Thus completed their contract with Napalm.
Their next releases were two singles leading up to their sixth full length album, 2014's Djevelmakt released by Indie Recordings.
