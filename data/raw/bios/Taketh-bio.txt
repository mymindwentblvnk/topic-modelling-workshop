Taketh is a melodic death metal act from Linköping, Sweden. Formed in 2000 by Mikael, David and Johan. 

Taketh started with two acoustic guitars in the air traffic controller tower on the military base in Linköping in 2000. Between watching the skies, David and Mikael started writing some songs and with the joining of Davids brother Johan, there was a band.
After playing the local scenes for a few years, along with a couple of ventures outside Linköping, Taketh secured a record deal with dutch label Fear Dark Records. The debut album Freakshow was released in 2005, and followed up with a tour with Eluveitie in 2006, now with new guitar player Atahan.
A three track EP called "Minus 24" was recorded and released in 2008, but due to babies and new jobs, the band chose to take a break.
A local festival brought the band back in 2011, and with the addition of Johan Ejnarsson, the guys felt they had a sold lineup and material to go on. Plans for a second album was started, and in October 2012 Taketh entered Endarker Studios for the third time. In 15 intense days, "Ignorance is strength" was born.
After much discussion, the band decided to forego the traditions of releaseing through a label, and started planning for something more modern. A creative commons licensed release, enabling free sharing, remixing and derivative works. This would certainly be a gamble, since everything would be payed for the band themselves.
