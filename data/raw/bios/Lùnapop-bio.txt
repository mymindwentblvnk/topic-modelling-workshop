Lùnapop was an Italian pop rock music group, active between 1999 and 2001.

Lùnapop released its lone full length Italian-language album, …squérez?, in 1999. The album quickly became a commercial success: its lead single, 50 Special, hit number one on the Italian charts in 1999, and ...Squérez? was the third-best selling album in Italy in 2000. The band won awards as Italy's best band, best album, and best newcomer in 2000. Lùnapop was also nominated for a 2000 MTV Europe Music Award and won the 2000 Festivalbar award for their single Qualcosa di grande.

Lùnapop split up in 2001. Lead singer Cesare Cremonini embarked on a solo career, and has since established himself as a popular Italian singer and songwriter. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/L%C3%B9napop">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
