Monotonix are a 3-piece of vocals, guitar and drums hailing from  Tel-Aviv, Israel.

Monotonix have performed across the world and their performances are very energetic, verging on performance art. From lighting drums on fire, to hanging from ceiling fixtures, often heavily crowd-involved, no performance in the same city is like the last.

On their American tour, Monotonix opened for the Silver Jews on the west coast playing to thousands of people in cities like San Francisco and Los Angeles. The band also toured the States and Europe in 2006 playing with artists such as Ted Leo & The Pharmacists, Oneida, Calvin Johnson, The Thermals, Kimya Dawson (Moldy Peaches), Old Time Relijun, Federation X, Birds of Avalon, Now It's Overhead and many more.

Monotonix have recorded their debut full length in Tel-Aviv with producer Kramer (Daniel Johnston, Low, Pussy Galore, Butthole Surfers), in 2006. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Monotonix">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
