Glifted was formed in 2001 by former Hum guitarist Tim Lash and Love Cup member T. J. Harrison. They released one album, Under and In on Hum's Martians Go Home label in 2003. It received generally positive reviews from critics.

The album was made up of experimental soundscapes, noise, loops, and beats to create an ethereal and sometimes chaotic sound that many critics compared to My Bloody Valentine. The duo recorded some material for an EP in 2005, but it remains unreleased. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Glifted">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
