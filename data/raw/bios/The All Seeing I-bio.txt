The All Seeing I are an English electronic music group from Sheffield, comprising Dean Honer, Jason Buckle and DJ Parrot (real name Richard Barratt). They released their first single I Walk in 1997, but it wasn't until the year after that they gained mainstream commercial success with the song Beat Goes On, a cover of the song by Sonny & Cher (or rather, a cover of Buddy Rich's version of the song).

Their work was something of a Sheffield collective, and the trio worked with artists from the City including Tony Christie, Jarvis Cocker, Phil Oakey, Babybird and many others. Their regular live vocalist was Bozz, who later went on to form electronica duo Hiem.

All Seeing I were asked to produce a cover of "Beat Goes On" for Britney Spears' debut album ...Baby One More Time. The have also remixed a variety of artists, including Pulp.

Dean Honer also fronts the similarly styled group, I Monster.

Buckle went on to be a part-time member of Fat Truckers and formed Relaxed Muscle with Jarvis Cocker and Richard Hawley. He also has a brief cameo as one of the Weird Sisters rock band in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film), along with Cocker, Pulp's Steve Mackey, Steve Claydon of Add N to (X), and Phil Selway and Jonny Greenwood of Radiohead.
