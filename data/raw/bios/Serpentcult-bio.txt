Serpentcult, a band from Ghent, Belgium featuring former members of Thee Plague Of Gentlemen and Welkin, has a deal with Lee Dorrian's Rise Above Records.
They had a doom metal sound comparable to that of Thee Plague Of Gentlemen, but with clean female vocals, managing to retain an original style, until in 2010 singer Michelle left the band.
The rest decided to stay a trio, hiring other instrumentalists and vocalists as needed.
