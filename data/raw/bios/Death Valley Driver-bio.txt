Death Valley Driver 

Charlottetown, PE, CA 
       
Metal / rock / Southern 




Like it's namesake, Death Valley Driver will leave you with a sore neck and a few bruises. 
Since forming in 2009, they have become one hardest gigging metal bands on the Island. Since playing shows in April of 2009, they have played close to 40 gigs all over the Maritimes. 
In that time, they have shared the stage with Canadian rockers White Cowbell Oklahoma, Neuraxis, as well as east coast heavyweights Iron Giant, The Motorleague, Black Moor and Children of Eve. 
Last summer Death Valley Driver was chosen as PEI's representative in Molson's battle of the bands to open for KISS in Halifax. 
2010 will be a banner year for the band, with the upcoming release of their album Choke The River. The album, engineered by Haywire's David Rashed, promises to be a bruising release, with molten riffs, whiskey-burned vocals and bottom-heavy grooves akin to their influences Pantera, Motorhead and Black Sabbath. 
Death Valley Driver are out to prove that PEI can produce some of the best metal on the East Coast.
