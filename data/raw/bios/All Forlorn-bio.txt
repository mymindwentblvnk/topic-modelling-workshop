We are a 5 piece metal band from Benoni/Johannesburg, South Africa and since our inception in [yearfomed]2006 the band have worked hard to get on the road and play as many shows as possible, having played nearly every possible venue we can in south Africa and racking hundreds of shows. The band has played many of South Africa's biggest rock and metal festivals and have built up a reputation of bringing the house down on the big stage. The band is driven to push itself into new territories and are always willing to put the work in and do it ourselves. We've gone thru lineup changes, and seen it all and are pushing and working harder then ever!
