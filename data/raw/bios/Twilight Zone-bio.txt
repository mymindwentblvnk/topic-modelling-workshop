2) 2 Unlimited was a Eurodance act formed in 1991. The project was the brainchild of Belgian producers Jean-Paul DeCoster and Phil Wilde, and was fronted by a Dutch duo, rapper Ray Slijngaard and singer Anita Doth. During five years of enormous worldwide success, the act scored 16 chart hits, including "Get Ready For This", "Twilight Zone", "No Limit" and "Tribal Dance". They are thought to have sold more than 20 million records worldwide and more than 50 million compilations.
Jean-Paul DeCoster and Phil Wilde met in their hometown of Antwerp,[2] Belgium, and their first collaboration under the name of Bizz Nizz, the single "Don't Miss The Party Line" [3], was a substantial hit across Europe, including in the United Kingdom where it reached no. 7 in the national singles chart in April 1990.[4] Its success came as a great surprise to the duo and encouraged them to continue working together.

In early 1991, a 19-year-old Ray Slijngaard was working as a chef at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam [5]. Ray was a friend of Quadrophonia rapper Marvin D [6], and whilst attending one of their gigs he took a microphone and started to rap in order to hype up the unenthusiastic crowd. Marvin was impressed and introduced him to DeCoster and Wilde, who got him to record a rap for "Money Money", a track that was being planned as a future Bizz Nizz single. [2] Meanwhile, Anita Doth (Dels is her stage name), also 19, was an administrator in the parking ticket division of an Amsterdam police station. In her spare time she performed in a female rap group called Trouble Sisters and she was spotted by Marvin, who asked her to be a backing singer for him. Ray and Anita became good friends, and some people believe that they had a relationship.

DeCoster and Wilde created an instrumental track called "Get Ready For This" and they decided that it needed some vocals. They asked Ray for his input and he duly recorded a rap for it. The band was initially meant to be a solo project with Ray fronting the act but then he added female vocals from Anita. They were so pleased with the result that they agreed to work with them as a duo, and thus 2 Unlimited was born. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Twilight+Zone">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
