Blodrunk was formed in 2005 by Erlend Ask Hanssen and Lars Bragen. The idea was to play some kind of fast metal but to avoid playing pure blackmetal, deathmetal or any other kind of extreme- metal. We naturally moved towards thrash and brought in catchy rock- riffs together with some simple but heavy grooves. Øyvind Kvalvågnes joined the band as a vocalist and bassplayer in april 2006 and participated on our first demo "Ei bøtte med blod", but left the band in august 2007. Within the 3 following weeks singer Martin Amsrud and bassist Wilson Urrustarazu joined the band. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Blodrunk">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
