Location: Greece

Amidst the filth of the spontaneous instilment of the laws of men. Through the human malevolence and the adversities of those few excommunicated from the lifestyle of the many, there sways like a pendulum the impermeable pact with the Adversary in the mirror. The nomenclatorial blood-bond that no death can do part nor no life will ever be worthy of applying it in its absolute grandeur: Violence. Deterioration in every form possible is the Goetic Equivalent in the system of mental derangement of the divine.
