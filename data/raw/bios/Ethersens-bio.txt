ETHERSENS is a progressive metal band from Midi-Pyrénées, France that was formed by Johan (guitar) and Mickael (guitar). They became a serious project when Steph (drums) decided to join the band in 2002.

In 2003, after several line-up changes, the band finally had a proper line-up when Fred (bass) and Stephan (vocals) joined the band. With everyone in the band having experience in other bands, they decided to focus on making an album more than beginning with demos or playing live.

The band recorded their debut album "Ordinary Days" during 2005/2006 that would be released on Scarlet Records in 2008.
