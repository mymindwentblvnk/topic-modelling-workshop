FABULOUS DESASTER is a thrash metal band from Bonn (NRW), Germany.

Founded in 2005 as "Stay Hungry", playing several acoustic Metal gigs (mixture of own material and cover songs). Changed name to "Fabulous Desaster" in 2010, now focusing only on Thrash Metal. The band's name is a reference/parody of the Exodus album "Fabulous Disaster". 

2010 line up:
- Jan (lead guitar & vocals)
- Jörg (rhythm guitar & backing vocals)
- Bude (bass guitar & nuclear weapons & vocals)
- Luke (drums)

After recording the 6-track EP "When The Silence’s So Loud" in 2010, Jörg left the band and Fabulous Desaster was put on hold.

In 2013 Matthes (Luke’s brother) joined the band on lead guitar and Fabulous Desaster was reanimated.
After working on new songs, Fabulous Desaster recorded the 5 track demo "Chaos.Torture.Terror.Violence" in summer 2014.

2014 line up:
- Jan (lead guitar & vocals)
- Matthes (lead guitar)
- Bude (bass guitar & nuclear weapons, now being highly toxic & vocals)
- Luke (drums)

In late 2014 Bude decided to leave the band (but still pursuing his dream to devastate the world).
Andi from the Heavy Metal band Hornado didn’t shrink from the virtually impossible task to fill in for Bude.

Current & 2015 line up:
- Jan (lead guitar & vocals)
- Matthes (lead guitar)
- Andi (bass guitar & lunatic performance & vocals)
- Luke (drums)

Well ok, here we go:
Fast, not slow, not modern, not old school (yeah ok, most people would say it is), not retro, not progressive, not technical, not simple …you got it:

It’s THRASH METAL!
