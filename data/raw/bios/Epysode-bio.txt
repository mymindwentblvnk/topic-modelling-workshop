EPYSODE is Samuel Arkan's (guitarist of the band Virus IV) new band project. Since years he was working on what was finally called "Obsessions" with the help of many high class musicians from the progressive/power metal scene. The final result is qualitative material which offers melodic and very song-oriented progressive metal at its best.

With the outstanding expressive voices from the likes of Kelly „Sundown“ Carpenter (Beyond Twilight, Darkology), Oddleif Stensland (Communic), Rick Altzi (At Vance, Thunderstone), Magali Luyten (Ayreon, Beautiful Sin, Virus IV) and Liselotte Hegt (Ayreon, Dial), the concept debut album “Obsessions” reaches an impressive draft and atmosphere which makes it a 'must have' for fans of ambitious bands/projects like Ayreon, Evergrey, Avantasia or Star One.

In addition to the singers' line-up, the project is peppered with the skills of many other musicians: besides the mastermind, band leader and guitarist Samuel Arkan, bass player Kristoffer Gildenlöw (Pain of Salvation, Dial), lead guitarist Christophe Godin (The Mörglbl Trio), drummer Leo Margarit (Pain of Salvation) and the young keyboard talent Julien Spreutels (Ethernity) are all part of the project. 

Mixing and mastering of the album was done by Tommy Hansen (Helloween, Pagan's Mind, Jorn). "Obsessions” will be released on August 26th by AFM Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Epysode">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
