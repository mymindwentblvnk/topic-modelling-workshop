Bhaobhan Sidhe were a Dutch black metal band formed in 1992. They released a 7'' EP titled "The New Order" in 1993 on Wild Rags Records followed by several demos between 1993 and 1995. Throughout their early releases they had played raw black metal with drum machine, but for their first and only full length titled "Corpse Crater" (1996) they changed their style to ambient/electronic music in the same vain. The band was fronted by Conscicide Dominus Arcula who also played drums in the Dutch underground black metal band Bestial Summoning. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bhaobhan+Sidhe">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
