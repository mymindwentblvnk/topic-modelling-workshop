Utrecht, Utrecht Province, Netherlands (2002 - 2009)

Utrecht based metalband Led Astray simply plays metal the way the bandmembers themselves like to hear it: a dynamic hybrid of death and thrash and although the band is not religious, there are undercurrents of spirituality in their lyrics. Led Astray was founded in 2002 by guitarists Martijn and Rogier with the intention of creating a refreshing mix of death and thrash in which the two styles complement each other seamlessly without sounding generic or attempting to be original. In search of the remaining bandmembers auditions were held after which Jona (drums), Melvin (vocals) and Yorick (bass) completed the line-up. 

Early 2005 the band self-released a six-track demo entitled Denying the Inevitable, which received praising reviews by the international metalpress. Following this release Led Astray hit the stage as often as it could to promote its demo and sold out quickly. The band featured in Henk Westbroek's weekly television show on RTV Utrecht called Westbroek! and was given the opportunity to shoot a video for the song Exceed the Feeling of Nothing. In July 2008 Led Astray entered the studio again. This time they chose Quintijn Verhoef’s Independent Recordings in Utrecht to record the first full-length “In Ways Unforeseen”.

Led Astray split-up in late 2009 due to members finding it difficult to make sufficient time for band related activities, musical preferences having changed, as well as feeling they had reached their limit musically. Yorick remains active as a guitarist in the progressive death/blackmetal band Deleterious and Melvin now handles drums in the grind band Porco Dio. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Led+Astray">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
