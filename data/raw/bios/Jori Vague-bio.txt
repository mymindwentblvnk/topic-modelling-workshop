American artist Jori Vague first garnered attention in 2017 when a handful of his singles went “internet platinum” on SoundCloud. Songs like “Pink Ranger”, “Focus”, and “Somethin’ on the Side” all racked up millions of streams which caught the attention of labels, fans, and the SoundCloud staff as well. SoundCloud then added Jori to their list of artists to watch in 2018 who were showing promising signs of momentum.   In 2018 Jori lived up to the hype the SoundCloud buzz had brought him with a few more additions to the catalog that measured up to his previous releases. In September 2018 Jori released “Facade”, his biggest single to date. This song was spontaneously dropped and took over Twitter, gaining 100k views in 24 hours and over 2 million to date.   In March 2019 his EP Indigo Nights was released featuring the hit single “Facade”. Indigo Nights became an instant classic with tracks such as “Better Off” and “Figment” which officially solidified Jori as a moody late night artist. In the fall of 2020 Jori continued his streak of vibes by adding Summer Simpin’ to the collection, an EP consisting of 3 songs. Though Jori Vague has received label, local, and global attention, he currently remains independent. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jori+Vague">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
