Recognized as the artist of a new generation, the rising pop star, and Platinum-selling artist SVEA debuted in 2018 with the slightly provocative singles "Don't Mind Me" and "Selfish". Spending every day writing songs and perfecting her signature sound, her highly-acclaimed debut EP ‘This is’ was released early 2019. “This Is” showcased the young artist’s talent as a developing songwriter, holding nothing back with her raw and emotional lyrics. 

Following her debut, SVEA collaborated with Danish powerhouse Alexander Oscar on their duet “Complicated”, co-written by SVEA, which - combined with all her songs - has seen SVEA reach nearly 40 million streams on Spotify alone and a Platinum certification in Denmark and Gold in Norway. SVEA has then performed on major TV shows in Sweden and Denmark and touring in the UK and Germany opening up for Picture This (who found her on Instagram). 

EQ Music wrote: "The young Swede showcases a supreme level of accomplishment. As a lyricist, she lays all her cards on the table. The lyrics are bristling with substance and unfiltered emotion. I am seeing, SVEA has the potential to become a bigger concern within the Swedish pop realm.” <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Svea">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
