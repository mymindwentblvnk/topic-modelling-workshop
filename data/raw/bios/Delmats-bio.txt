After the ethno-death band Secret South split-up, the mastermind of the band Drago Mandic (guitar-lead vocals), joined forces with drummer Vedran Pazulj and went on to form (the band) Death In Fire. However, Death In Fire disbanded due to technical difficulties, but the idea and basis for further collaboration remained. During that time, the lyrics and music for the basis of today’s Delmats were born. 
The band itself was formed and began with its work in the beginning of 2006 in the following line-up :
Drago Mandic (guitar), Zeljo Dalmatin (guitar-vocals), Ivan Jovanovic (bass), Vedran Pazulj (drums) and Dalibor Bosnjak (lead vocals). 
The band struggled with finding a name for quite some time, but, in the end, it was decided that the band shall be named after one of the original (first) inhabitants of the Balkans (Herzegovina to be more precise) – the Dalmati. 
During the band’s efforts in writing the songs for their first (debut) album (Seeds Of Impurity), Dalibor Bosnjak (vocals) quit the band due to personal reasons, leaving Drago and Zeljo in a position to take complete control over vocal arrangements. 
The band entered the studio in late February 2007., and recorded their debut album. The band also struck a bit of luck when they got accidentally associated with John Auld from the United Kingdom, who did professional album covers for their debut CD. 
The band itself never played before an live audience prior to their first gig in Ljubuški, on 13th April 2007., on the promotion of their debut album, along with Koshmar and Agera Contra. It was their first public appearance.
