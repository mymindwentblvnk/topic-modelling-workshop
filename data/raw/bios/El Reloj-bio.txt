El Reloj is a progressive rock band that emerged out of the Buenos Aires rock scene of the 1970s. The band consisted of Willy Gardi (lead guitar), Juan Esposito (drums-vocals), Eduardo Frezza (bass, lead vocals), Osvaldo Zavala (guitar) and Luis Valenti (Hammond Organ, vocals). Their brand of music usually garners comparisons to Deep Purple. By employing blues rock riffing, complex song structures, symphonic tendencies and breaks in their music, El Reloj acheived much fame within the Argentine capital's underground rock scene. 

The band was formed in 1972, and by the following year, they issued their first single ("El Mandato"). 73 and 74 saw the release of three more singles ("Vuelve el Dia a Reinar", "Alguien Mas En Quien Confiar" and "Blues del Atardecer"). By 1975, the band finally released their debut LP. Titled simply "El Reloj," this album symphonic hard rock that extended the scope of the music far beyond the limitations of the single format. Conceptually rich and musically vigorous, this first album was a masterful example of the symphonic hard rock sensibilities that so characterized the band. 1975 also saw the release of "El Reloj 2," which has been described as being more symphonic than hard. However, by 1977, the band broke up. 

1983 saw the band reunited under Gardi's guidance. That line-up released "La Esencia Es La Misma." 11 years later, the original line-up reunited and released "Santos y Verdugos." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/El+Reloj">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
