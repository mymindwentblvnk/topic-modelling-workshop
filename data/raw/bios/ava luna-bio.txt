In an alternate world somewhere, the Ronettes developed three crushes – one for James Chance, one for David Byrne, and one for Aphex Twin – and they all decided to form a band. Yes, sometimes the electro noise-punk would drown out the gospel croons, and sometimes the soaring harmonies would make the post-dance beats sullen, but somehow they made it work. 

The boys & girls in Ava Luna probably couldn’t have met but in a New York public high school, and by no means should they have ended up all in one band. But so it goes. 

Carlos sings and writes the tunes; Felicia, Becca and Anna do vocal harmonies and dance steps; Nathan plays jagged synth-noise lines, Ethan plays bass and Julian plays the drums. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ava+Luna">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
