We are of atoms and Milky way, guided by the violence and the intensity of the Universe. The dark matter holding our fragmented humanity together. We are the crude mirror showing the failure of our existence. We come to avenge our infinite potential and from it's exposed guts, we will dirt the guilty face of mankind. We are Vehemal.
