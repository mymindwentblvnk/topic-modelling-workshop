Based out of central North Carolina, Cursed From Birth formed in the summer of 2012. They recorded their first e.p., “Sins and Sacrifices,”at Warrior Sound Studios in Chapel Hill, and immediately began playing shows. In June of 2012, Cursed From Birth successfully competed in a battle of the bands, winning a local opener slot on that year's Mayhem Fest in Atlanta, Ga.
