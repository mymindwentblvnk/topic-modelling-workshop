YellowFever play minimal art pop ala Young Marble Giants, Stereolab, and 80s Rough Trade. They formed in the summer of 2006 and have two self-released EPs, a 7” released by Hugpatch records, and a full length compilation of all their previous recordings that was released by the Vivian Girls’ label, Wild World, in December 2009.
