Northern California’s SHADOWKILLER are living proof that raw talent, ambition and honesty can still prevail in a very large metal music community. With their debut record Slaves Of Egypt, and a sophomore album on the way, they look to expand their world wide fan base with their new partners at Pure Steel Records!

By aligning their unwavering dedication to the do-it-yourself work ethic with a signature sound, singer/guitarist Joe Liszt, bassist Dan Lynch, drummer Gary Neff, and guitarist Marc Petak have helped to define the landscape of today’s nor cal metal music scene. The backbone of their work? Stylistically progressive songs, suggesting a range of influences from Iron Maiden to Symphony X. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Shadowkiller">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
