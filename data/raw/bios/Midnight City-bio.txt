Midnight City are Liverpool based DJ/Producers and long-time friends Jonny and Josh. Producing records since the early 00s, they have a rich background in the diverse spectrum of electronic music.

They started Midnight City in late 2013, during the dizzying resurgence of 'Deep' and 90's inspired House music in the UK. Their first club hit came in the shape of beloved house diva Kim English's 2015 vocal cut and Hed Kandi anthem 'Natural High', which the duo produced and released through illustrious New York label Nervous Records.

In late 2015, they found mainstream success co-producing the Philip George and Anton Powers summer smash 'Alone No More', which topped both the UK Singles and Club charts. 
Their own singles followed in 2016, including debut 'Just Like That' (Get Twisted/Sony) which reached number one in Music Week's Upfront Club chart and follow-up 'Free', released on Pete Tong's legendary FFRR record label.

After a brief 2017 hiatus, the duo marked their return to the clubbier realms of house music with their latin/tribal inspired numbers 'Carmen' and 'Release Yourself', released on Kevin McKay's almighty Glasgow Underground label. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Midnight+City">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
