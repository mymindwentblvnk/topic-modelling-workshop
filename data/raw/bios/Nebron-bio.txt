The band was formed in 1996 by ISTVÁN VASS-lead guitar and BALAZS LEVAI-vocals. Before that we had played in an elementary black/death band called PURGATORIUM. After having chosen the name NEBRON we started to write our new songs and later we had some gigs in Hungary. In October 1997 we entered the studio and recorded our first and only demo "THE MESSAGE". We recorded these songs with GYÕZÕ KÖRTVÉLYESSY-drums and FERENC PAPP-bass. The sales were very good, we sold 1000 cassettes in all parts of the world, and got a lot of good review in the metal magazines, like ABLAZE mag, HELLFLAME mag.,ANCIENT CEREMONIES, CHAOS mag. and more others. We sent tapes for some labels and in the end of '98 DARK HORICON RECORDS. gave us a honest contract for a CD. Meanwhile we kicked out our drummer and bassist and recorded some songs with two other members. In '99 we found our true drummer, TAMÁS SÁNDOR, our rhythm-guitarrist has been ZOLTÁN CSENDES and BALÁZS LÉVAI playing on bass beside the vocals since then. Our first CD was signed on DHR in winter 1999/2000 and it consists "THE MESSAGE" demo and four bonus tracks from '98. Later in March 2000 we recorded two killer pagan songs for a split CD/gatefold LP. The split CD version was released in the spring of 2002. on DARK HORIZON RECORDS/REALMS OF DARKNESS PRODUCTIONS with 3 killer bands from North America. ALLFATHER from Canada, HORDES OF THE LUNAR ECLIPSE and GNOSTIC from the USA. It was the main release before the full-length, and the result was very good! Since than our full-lenghth album songs are ready, now we want to release these newest songs for our "DOMINATION OF SEVEN BLOOD" album.
Our lyrics are about ancient Hungarian history, pagan culture, heathen values, human weakness, nature, grim darkness, destruction, etc. We are very interested in the ancient Sumerian, Egyptian, Phoenician cultures. Ancient Hungarian paganism is very similar to these. Before the Christian expansion, in the 9th-10th century, the Hungarian pagan hordes were very strong and were feared all over Europe just like the Vikings in Scandinavia. We spread the heathen spiritual heritage against the Christianity.

Nebron is the Latin version of a word of Assyrian origin, its meaning is "hunter". This name can be related with ancient Hungarian history, as according to ancient sources he was the main god in the religion of the Hungarians. This is the reason why we all considered this name as the best one.
