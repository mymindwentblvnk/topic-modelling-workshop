August Frost were a death metal band from Vancouver, Canada. Their lineup consisted of Mark and Scott Fraser doing guitar/vocals and bass respectively, in addition to Jordan Burgess on guitar and Bart Ings on drums.

In 1993, the band released a demo cassette titled State of Mind with six tracks in total. In 1995, they released the demo cassette Destiny Machine, with four songs totaling to 21 minutes in length.

In 1997, August Frost contributed the song Krickets to the 'GRRRR!! Extreme Music From Vancouver - Volume 1' compilation album created by Devin Townsend. Also during that year, the band would release their only full-length album, Engines of God. Krickets was featured as the second track. This was August Frost's final release before mysteriously disappearing.

Engines of God would later gain a small cult following after a handful of the tracks from it were used as the soundtrack to EA Sports' 2009 games, NHL 09 and 3 on 3 NHL Arcade. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/August+Frost">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
