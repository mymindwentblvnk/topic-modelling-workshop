Black metal from Finland.  Released a demo in 2003 and a full length album in 2011 entitled "Relics Of Inner War".  This is the solo project of Vainaja, who also plays in Horna and Sargeist.  
The music of Cornigr is very inspired by the early 90's Norwegian black metal scene, specifically the music found on albums such as "Under a Funeral Moon" and "De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cornigr">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
