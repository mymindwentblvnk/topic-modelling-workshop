Prayers of Sanity appeared in Lagos, Portugal, decided to show everyone that 80's Thrash still lives. Formed in December 2005 by guitarist André, bassman Carlos and guitarist/vox Tião (in that time he was drumer/vox), Prayers had their inicial line-up complete. Some time after and with some tryouts, the drummer Bruno was found and the final piece to their line-up was added.

Altough influenced by several music genres, Thrash-Metal stood out and defined the stile of these Portuguese Thrashers.

After 20years of the origin of this genre, Prayers of Sanity made Thrash-Metal a constant meal, but still adds its touch of modern energy, beer and party! Prayers of Sanity are not "just another Thrash band"!

After some important gigs like Algarve em Chamas VII and sharing stages with international bands like Gama Bomb(IRL), Bonded by Blood(USA), Sworn Amongst(SWE) and with some important national bands like Digamma, Mordaça, etc., they've decided to record with Dalma Productions their debut album "Religion Blindness" summer 2008. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Prayers+of+Sanity">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
