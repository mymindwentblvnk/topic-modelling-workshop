Whispering Tears has begun as an instrumental band, Nicolas, Bruno and Frank playing guitar, Sylvain at the bass and Cedric behind the drums. The bunch of friends has started to evolve without trying to stay in a particular style but seeking their own kind of sound. Since, technical improvement and having fun are the only aims of the band. Yves as vocal join them to complete the line-up. In 2001, the band recorded his first album (8 tracks self-produced CD) called "Carmina Lacrimosa". Few concerts in Paris (New Morning, Batofar, Gibus...) and in different other cities (Lyon, La Roche sur Yon, Orléans...), several local and foreign press chronicles and interviews help them to promote and broadcast their productions.

Today, Whispering Tears heads totally toward a Death Metal based style. Eric's incoming as vocals performer and the inspiration of the new tracks come within this logic. The new EP called "Esprit souillé", recorded and produced by the band itself shows from now on a new direction and the true commitment to offer a dynamic and powerful music. For tomorrow, Whispering Tears has for objective to play more live and find the people to participate to the diffusion of the EP and to record the new LP before the end of the year. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Whispering+Tears">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
