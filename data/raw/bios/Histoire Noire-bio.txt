Formed in 2001, this Belgian trio plays oldschool raw Black Metal. The band recorded 2 CDemo's ("Dood en Verderf" - 2003 and "Demo II - Wraak" - 2006) and one exclusive track for the third Lugburz compilation (Hecatombe of Men). 
Because of 2 of the 3 bandmembers moved to other countries, the band is non-active nowadays. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Histoire+Noire">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
