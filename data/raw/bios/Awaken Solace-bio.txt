Awaken Solace is a new Brisbane based, female fronted symphonic metal band that combines a theatrical mix of orchestral power metal, medieval baroque and fantasy-style soundtracks. Full orchestral and choral arrangements compliment the band’s five piece line-up of vocals, bass, guitar, drums and keyboards; making the band unique to the current Brisbane and wider Australian metal scene.

On 1 June 2012, Awaken Solace launched their debut album 'In Nightfall’s Embrace', a 2 disc digipak, containing an additional symphonium rendition of the album. Each disc contains 14 tracks of pure musical indulgence, from fast paced, progressive, sweeping epics through to beautiful, soft and melodic arias that will leave the listener breathless.
