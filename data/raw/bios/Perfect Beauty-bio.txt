Taken from band's Facebook page:

Initially active from 2006 until 2007, Perfect Beauty was my testing ground for various kinds of "anti-music", such as industrial electronic, dark ambient and noise. Due to computer crash, it was put on ice in late 2007.

In 2011 I managed to retrieve the data from the old hard drive and Generator album was finally released. In between 2011 and 2013 I released several EPs containing both old and new tracks, still very harsh and hard to listen.

In 2014 project underwent the major changes - it became even more dark and minimalistic, as I started to produce Drone Doom Metal instead of electronic.
