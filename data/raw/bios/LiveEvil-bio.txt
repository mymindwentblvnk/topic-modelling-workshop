The band was founded in 2003. It didnÂ´t have a live drummer at the beginning and the rytmical section consisted just of samples and drum loops. This team configuration was recorded on the four-song demo called LINES (Crystal production).
   One year later a promo stuff was cut. It contained two songs (SELFCURING and LUCID) that foreshadowed the style LIVEEVIL was going to adopt. The first video-clip was cut for LUCID and songs managed to circle around a few radios. After several concerts a live drummer was taken in. A successful Bohemian-Moravian tour with bands DISSOLVING OF PRODOGY and EUTHANASIA confirmed that this acceptance was the right choice.
   In spring 2006 LIVEEVIL cut a long-play record which shows a combination of bold and expressive keybord ideas with a subtuned quitar and vigorous vocals wandering into a typical gothic rock metal sound in some parts. LIVEEVIL seems to be one of the best formations of this style appearing on our musical scene today. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Liveevil">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
