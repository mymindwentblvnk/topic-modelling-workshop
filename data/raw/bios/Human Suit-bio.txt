Human Suit was founded  in the middle of 2006 in Paderborn, Germany. After a short starting period and some month of hard working they released their first self-titled Demo in the beginning of October 2007. The music can be described as modern, energetic and quite rapid Thrash-Metal with a melodic note on the right place and an intentional dodgy songwriting.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/HUMAN+SUIT">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
