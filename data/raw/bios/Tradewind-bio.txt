Tradewind were formed in the end of March 2001 in Volos (Greece) by Dimitris (keys) and Kostas (drums & vocals). A promo CD named “Conspiracy Of Dreams” was out in the same year. After that, the band remained idle until December 2003 when was reformed in Thessaloniki (Greece), where Kostas alone searches and recruits new members: Ntinos (guitar) and Antonis (guitar), alongside with other session musicians who filled the empty band members places. Two more demo CDs followed: “Love it is…” (May 2005), “Aspects” (February 2007). The CDs are produced by the band trying to present and transmit an atmospheric and powerful metal sound.
