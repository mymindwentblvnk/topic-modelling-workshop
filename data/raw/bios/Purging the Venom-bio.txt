Formed in 2011, Purging The Venom are a four piece metal band from the south west of the United Kingdom and have progressed from a straight forward metal band into a groove orientated, melodic thrash metal outfit.

Throughout 2012, the band had played shows all around the U.K supporting acts such as Evile, Revoker and Romeo Must Die as well as recording their first demo "Eradicate the System".

In 2013 Purging The Venom recorded and released their first EP titled "Possession" which received great feedback critically and among their local metal scene. In addition to the release of the EP, Purging The Venom promoted this release by touring the south west of the United Kingdom as well as supporting acts such as Bleed From Within.

Purging The Venom's current line up was solidified in early 2013 when Ben Rice joined the band on drums and the band began writing a follow up to "Possession" in late 2013 due for release in 2014.

In 2014, Purging The Venom joined forces with Equivalence Music as their booking agent. Later in the year they will be touring the U.K and playing bigger support shows. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Purging+the+Venom">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
