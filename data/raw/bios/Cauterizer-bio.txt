Cauterizer is a metal band from the Danish town of NÃ¦stved, and has been playing together since summer 2013.

The quartet from the southern Zealand, plays a strong mix of melodic and progressive death metal and they are strongly inspired by band such as Opeth, Amon Amarth and Lamb Of God.
In January 2017, the band debuted at the small venue called Paramount in Roskilde. Here they performed a 45 minute concert, with original music and a compelling cover of Metallicas Seek And Destroy.
Since their debut, Cauterizer has participated in Emergenza Festival 2018, where they performed two short concerts.
So far, the climax of the bands career is the concert in Slagelse in the last part of 2018. Here Cauterizer performed together with Killing and the mighty trash metal veterans Impalers.

The bands is now looking forward to the recording of their first ever EP. The recording is starting in June 2019 and will be at Sonne Studios, with Nicklas Sonne - the frontman of Defecto - behind the console.
