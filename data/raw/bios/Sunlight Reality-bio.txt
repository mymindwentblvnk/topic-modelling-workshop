SUNLIGHT REALITY was formed in June 2011 in Nizhny Novgorod (Russia) by ex-members of a band Fall From Reality, which earlier released an album titled WITHDRAWAL (2009, Chaotic Noiz/Soyuz music). Fall From Reality gained recognition as a Russian melodic death metal band by performing numerous shows across Russia while touring together with various local and foreign well-established bands.
The current lineup of the band includes Vladimir (guitars) and Alex (drums) as the founding members. Vladimir took a leading role in composing the material. An old friend and collaborator (ex. Crownthorn, ex. IVO) Stas Verichev brought his extensive skills as a vocalist. Stanislav Stoupin (NOESIS - USA) joined forces with the band as a bassist.
Recently, the band has recorded their debut album titled "Through the Rings of Darkness" in NAVAHOHUT studios (Moscow, Russia). The album was mixed and mastered by Arkady Navaho. Keyboards on the album were composed and recorded by Artyom Nizhnikov. "Through The Rings Of Darkness" features 10 tracks of technical melodic death metal. Lyrics to the album was written by Vlad Tarasov. Vlad earlier wrote/contributed lyrics for other bands such as Fall From Reality and Crownthorn. Throughout the years the band members of Sunlight Reality also played roles in these projects.
