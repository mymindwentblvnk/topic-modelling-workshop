Grand Supreme Blood Court is a Dutch Death Metal band with Doom Metal influences. The band rose from the ashes of "The Company of Undertakers" of which Martin van Drunen, Eric Daniels and Bob Bagchus already made songs for in 2010. Those 4 tracks were left in the closet due to the busy schedule from the other bands, Asphyx and Hail Of Bullets. In the meantime Eric kept working on riffs and thought it was time to see them evolve as songs and thus being recorded as well. So it happened, the name change was a fact and Eric wanted Alwin Zuur (Asphyx) as the second guitarist. Eric and Alwin sat down together and brutality was born. 

In the autumn of 2011 the album was recorded in the Sonic Assault Studio (where Asphyx's - Death...the Brutal Way was also recorded) by engineer Frank Klein Douwel. 11 tracks of ultimate brutality and heaviness. Theo van Eekelen (Hail Of Bullets) joined the band as a bass player. In the end, the album was called Bow Down Before the Blood Court. The concept was clear: absolute punishment for those who fail to obey. 

The musical influences of Grand Supreme Blood Court are: old Possessed, Death Strike, Infernäl Mäjesty, Hellhammer and Malhavoc. Century Media released the album worldwide in November 2012. Since the labelroots of Martin, Eric and Bob are bound to this very label since 1990, the band feels it is great and natural to see the album released here as well.
