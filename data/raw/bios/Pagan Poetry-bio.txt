Pagan Poetry was created during 2001 (Santiago, Chile), when Gonzalo and Andrew decided to continue with an old school metal project. On April, Nicolás joined the band to make noise with the bass. The band opened their first show in December, with good opinions from the crowd.

In 2002, Eduardo joined Pagan Poetry, as the new singer, and the band started to play a lot in Santiago, Chile, at some metal bars and clubs. A first demo was recorded, but before, Sebastian Rodriguez was recruited to be the other guitar player.

There were some problems and Sebastian left the band, six months later, Felipe Novoa took Sebastian's place, and the band went to the studio to record a new self produced demo, called Black Omen.

2005 was an interesting year for the band, but at the end of it, Felipe Novoa left the band, and Pagan Poetry returned to the first complete line-up, which includes Gonzalo, Nicolás, Eduardo, Andrew and Felipe Rodriguez as the guitarist on gigs and concerts.
