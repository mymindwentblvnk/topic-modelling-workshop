There are multiple artists using the name Ovo: 1) an Italian noise rock band; 2) a Portuguese indie pop band; 3) a Polish rock band; 4) an electronic/experimental group from California, USA.

1) OvO is a noise rock band formed in Milan, Italy by Stefania Pedretti (?Alos, ex-Allun) and Bruno Dorella (ex-Wolfango, Bugo, Lava), often joined by friends that belong to many different musical scenes. Bruno and Stefania basically started this project to stay together: they were used to follow their partner’s different bands on tour, but they were also sick of the problems that every band has connected with the members lives, works, studies. It was natural for them to form an open but autonomous duo, free to tour and record with or without the collaboration of other musicians. Their albums are released in Europe by Bruno Dorella's label Bar La Muerte. Official Myspace: http://www.myspace.com/ovobarlamuerte

2) Ovo is an indie pop band from Lisbon, Portugal, formed by Maria Radich (vocals), Nuno Barreiro (guitar), Filipe Malta (keyboards) and Tiago Gonçalves (bass).

3) Ovo is a Polish rock band that puts at least as much effort into the packaging of their albums as in the music itself, which is very detailed and precise. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/OVO">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
