Obscuria is a Melodic Death Metal Band from Dresden, Germany.

Obscuria was found in January 2006 by Bernd and David trying to create a style of Metal combining heavy Death and Thrash parts together with melodic parts and solos. After several days Chris, a friend of Bernd and David joined as the bass player. Later on Markus and Roland, the little brother of Bernd, joined and we started to write songs so that we were able to record our first 4-track-demo “Victory or Death” in June 2006. In the same summer we had our first gig supporting the Tequila Monsters in the Groovestation, Dresden. Till the end of the year 2006 we played several gigs supporting Sadistic Brainslaughter, The Roughnecks, Exidium and Identity Kills. We also played our first gig at a festival called Metalfestival ² gegen Krebs (Metalfestival ² against cancer).
At this point we want to thank all bands we were allowed to support last year and also a big thanks to Enni (G.U.C.) and Anja for producing the Metalfestival² DVD.

In the beginning of 2007 we started to record our first album, that will be released in summer 2007.
