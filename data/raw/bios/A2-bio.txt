There are multiple artists with the name A2.

1) A2 aka Wesley Bishop, rapper and producer hailing from the Croydon area. He is apart of the new “7” coined by many artist such as Krept & Konan, Stormzy, Bonkaz and Section Boyz who all come from the CR7 postcode. Like many rappers in the UK A2 started rapping on grime before being influenced to start rapping on more R&B sounds alongside creating production with oldskool R&B samples. Some say this is new genre defined sonically as “Trap Soul”.
Since 2012 A2 has dropped seven E.P’s “Hennessy Thoughts”, “Faded Photographs”, “VII”, VII 2, “Once Too Many” and the critically acclaimed “More Sleep”. Late in 2016 he recently released More Sleep 2 as a wait over for the fans anticipation of A2’s first mixtape Blue coming at some point in 2017.

2) Mona Lisa Overdrive formerly known as A2.
A gripping new mix of “80’s New Wave" meets "Modern Electronica". A2 is sure to grab your heart with their cool modern sounds, atmospheric guitars, and deeply emotional vocal style. They are currently unsigned...but you can find their tracks all over the web...as well as on Sega's "Shadow The Hedgehog" Game and the Shadow soundtrack ("Lost and Found"). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/A2">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
