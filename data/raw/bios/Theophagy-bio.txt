Theophagy was formed in the summer of 2007 in West Lafayette, Indiana and plays a mix of death metal and prog with symphonic tendencies.  You've never heard anything quite like this.  Comparisons can be made to bands such as Nocturnus, Disillusion, Nihilist, Opeth, Swallow The Sun, Equilibrium, Dream Theater etc, but the music stands alone.  That's a pretty screwed up combination of bands anyways.
