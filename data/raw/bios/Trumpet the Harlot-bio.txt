Trumpet the Harlot is a Northern Virginia-based metal band that never ceases to impress with its technicality, relentless speed, and undying energetic live show. A group that concentrates less on the current image associated with metal and more on the songs and the emotions they evoke, this quintet is about one thing: the music. The songs and live show are full of brutally fast riffs, chugging anthems, and an energy that has to be seen to be appreciated. With one look at these four, you can tell there is something different about them. Unafraid to be themselves, there are smiles, high fives, and a lightheartedness that is truly infectious. Trumpet the Harlot realize that metal is ready for a shift and are prepared to spearhead it. Their debut album will be released March 20th, 2012, produced by Matt Bachand of Shadows Fall and Times of Grace. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Trumpet+the+Harlot">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
