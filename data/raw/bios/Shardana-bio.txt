Shardana was born in the early 2008 thanks to an idea of Fabrizio Pinna (rythm guitar) and DanieleManca (lead guitar) to create a metal band with epic and battling sounds. 
Aaron Tolu (bass and vocals), and Matteo Sulis (drums) soon joined the band. 

Shardana was the name of the Sardinian pirate folk who sailed the Mediterranean sea in the second millenium BC that mostly inspired the songwriting of the band, trying to merge the Heavy Metal sound with the Black and Viking one. 
The lyrics of the band talk about the glorious courage and the legendary proud of those people who contribute to soar the influence of Sardinia at the times of the pharaoh Ramses. Part of the songs are written in Sardinian Language, such as: Sa Battalla (The Battle), Sa Sedda 'e su Diaulu (Devil's Seddle) and Pocos Locos y Maliunidos (Few, Mad and Not United). 
After a period of rehearsing the band started to play at some of the most important festivals in the island like the “Heavy Sands Festival” in Cagliari who brought bands like Mnemic and Kaledon. In the middle of 2009 Shardana started recording their first Mini CD. Actually the band is engaged in the composition of new songs and in promotional activities along Sardinia.
