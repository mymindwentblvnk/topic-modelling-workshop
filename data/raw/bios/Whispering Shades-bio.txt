Whispering Shades was a Melodic Black Metal band from Poland, formed in 2003 and split-up in around 2006. They were known for their independence and promoted their work as independent and musical rights. They were known for being very Anti-Black Metal image and they could almost be considered Death Metal, in that context.

Their one and only album entitled "The Dawn of Immortal Hope" was a demo album, which featured six tracks and embodied passionate lyrics of darkness and sadness. While trying to hide behind the fence with the animosities of Satanism. This album was released in November of 2004 and of that era was; certainly uniquely, individual and old-school oriented. 

When they first had formed they covered various Heavy Metal and Melodic Black Metal artists. Later on, the line-up had some prior conflicts and that's why some of the members had left. The drummer of the band was in need to join the Polish army and had to leave. After their demo they figured their pay was too low, thus quitting and giving their tracks out free on the internet.
