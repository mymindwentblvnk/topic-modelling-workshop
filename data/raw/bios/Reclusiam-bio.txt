Reclusiam blends the two doom metal sub genres of funeral doom and death doom metal. The atmospheric values are gloomy, despair-driven, yet beautiful and enigmatic. As far as vocals are concerned, the solitary member Ryan Henry takes the route of grunts and growls. Laurie Ann Haus (Autumn Tears, Todesbonden) contributed with the spoken words on "Litanies of Rust and Decay". Henry has truly created a depressive masterpiece that is sure to appeal to fans of modern-day doom metal.
