Iras is an African rap artist who developed the art of composing, writing & storytelling ever since he created his persona.

His vision of the hip-hop world is the reason why he doesnâ€™t take the same approach as typical rap artists and instead creates characters, their psyches and then put them in motion through stories.

His atypical universe will give you an outlook of the newest generation of African rap artists. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Iras">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
