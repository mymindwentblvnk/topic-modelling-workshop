There are multiple artists going by Atomik.  1. Thrash metal band from Miami, Florida.  2. A hip-hop DJ.  3. An electronic music artist.

1.  This band is interested in hanging out, playing Xbox, eating pizza and jamming.  This thrash metal band started out in late 2008.  It was formed by drummer Chris Fonseca and lead guitarist Mario Carvajal.  They hail from Miami, Florida.  They have many influences such as Municipal Waste, Toxik, Kreator, Razor and Artillery.  During the band's early days, they had Erick Videla on rhythm guitar and Andres Gonzalez on bass.  Ryan Taylor became the vocalist.  They called themselves Atomic at first, but someone suggested them to change it to Atomik with a K.  Ryan was asked to do rhythm guitar and vocals while Mario and Erick were lead guitarists.  Erick left since they didn't need three people playing guitar in the band.  Andres left the band for personal reasons.  Bassist Alan Suero replaced Andres.

The official lineup now is Ryan Taylor on vocals & guitar, Mario Carvajal on lead guitar, Alan Suero on bass and Chris Fonseca on drums.  They released a self-titled demo in 2011 and a self-titled EP in 2012.  They disbanded in 2013 and then reunited in 2017.  They decided to work on a full-length album.  In 2018, they released their debut full-length album The Fallout through Dr. Fukk (frontman of Thrash or Die)'s label Empingao Records.
