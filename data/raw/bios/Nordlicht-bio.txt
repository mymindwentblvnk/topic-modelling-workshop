Nordlicht is a black metal / ambient solo project of Nimosh from Switzerland. He also runs Kunsthall Productions label with Wintherr from Paysage d'Hiver. Nordlicht was formed already in 1996 though to this day only one release has been released - the debut album "Nebelmeer" in 2002. However, Nordlicht is still alive and has contributed a track on the compilation of various artists called "Schneesturm". There is also a split release with Paysage d'Hiver coming up later in 2007. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nordlicht">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
