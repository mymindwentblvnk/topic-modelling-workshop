Legacy of War is an unsigned death metal band from Northern Nevada. They have been playing for near 2 years now, unsigned, without a lineup that they were happy with. They have now found a lineup that really works together to create some of the most brutal music heard in NV. That lineup is Drew Gliever [vocals], Zac Fitchett [guitar], Matt Vallarino [Drums], and Danny Mandokie [bass]. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Legacy+of+War">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
