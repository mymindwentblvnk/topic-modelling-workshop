2, Malsum (extreme metal):

Named after the Algonquin tribes “god of evil,” a wicked spirit in the form of a 12 foot man with the head of a wolf, Malsum unleashes terror and awe among all mankind. Formed by band members Sam Cabrera(guitars,vocals) Cliff Robinson, Brian Townsand(drums) and John Lucero(bass) in the winter of 2003. The members of Malsum (pronounced Mall-soom) have shared the stage with metal giants Cannibal Corpse, Testament, and Malevolent Creation. Malsum has gone on to make a name for themselves as leaders in extreme metal. Known for their intensity and energizing live performance, Malsum has floored audiences around the Southwest of the United States. Sam Cabrera and guitarist Cliff Robinson offer soaring riffs and chilling vocals that are sure to get heads banging. Combined with bassist John Lucero’s unreal bass lines and Brian Townsand’s pulverizing drums, Malsum creates contagious insanity. With the completion of their demo, Malsums next step is to introduce their brand of extreme metal to the entire U.S. and abroad. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Malsum">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
