Midvinterblot was founded in October 2010 by Pamela "Trollgumma" Wasiluk and Stefan Stolica. The band has been working on its own material ever since and was mostly focused on live gigs which resulted in the band only having one demo recording. During the two years of the band's existence, some smaller changes in line-up have occurred and the band currently includes seven members.

Måns Carlbring - Guitar
Anton Trollmania - Guitar
