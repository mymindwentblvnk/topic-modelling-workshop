Paganfire is a deathrash band from the Philippines, formed some time around 2003. Paganfire play a lo-fi and brutal form of blackened thrash metal, rooted in the old school of 1980s demo tape metal bands. Their music shows clear influences taken from Venom, Sabbat, Tormentor, and (early) Mayhem. 

As of 2009, they have put out three demo tapes, one self-titled full album, and a series of split releases with other underground metal bands such as Evil Attack, Interment, and Warlock Moon. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Paganfire">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
