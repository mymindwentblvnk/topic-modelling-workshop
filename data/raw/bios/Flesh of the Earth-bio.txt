*Flesh of the Earth records live. We believe this represents our sound better than copy and looped style recording that so many "popular" radio artists use. Too many bands sound like crap when you see them live because they depend heavily on lip syncing and looping - with us, what you hear on our recordings is what we actually sound like in a live setting *

Formed in spring, 2008, Flesh of the Earth is a three piece band of self taught musicians from the Northwest L.P. of Michigan, USA. 

Their influences range from the darker side of music and they try to approach it with an artistic macabre. The sound of FotE  is more of a horror movie and varies from Groove Metal, Black n' Roll, Death n' Roll and Doom metal genres.  A various concoction of Horror and Metal.


Flesh of the Earth is:

Tudnar the Butcher -  Lead Guitar/vocals
Uncle Goat - Percussion
Sijjvra - Bass Guitar
