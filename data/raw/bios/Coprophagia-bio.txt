Coprophagia (which means consumption of feces) is a Death Metal band from Skøyen in Oslo, Norway, but they describe their genre as Humor Death Metal. The only known member of the band is called Steffen. 
After the successful song called "Ding Dong Song", inspired by the Swedish singer and photo model Günther (Mats Söderlund), they recorded the songs "Eating Santa Claus" (aka "ESC") and "Orphanage Determination". They also  tried to adapt some lyrics by Norwegian danse band Ole Ivars in their songs.
After recording some other tracks based on Ole Ivars' lyrics, they decided to dissolve the band due to the lack of a fan base. Three of the remaining members started the project of Arizona Renegades, playing flute-based western/country instrumentals, which also failed. The band now calls itself Dictator (among another bands with the same name), still based on the same music genre as in Arizona Renegades. More than a dozen songs were recorded since then. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Coprophagia">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
