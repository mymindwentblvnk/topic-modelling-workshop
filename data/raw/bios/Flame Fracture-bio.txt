Flame Fracture are a five piece death metal band from the South West of England. Taking a wide range of influences from the pioneers of melodic death metal as well as both heavier and more progressive bands they deliver music with multiple vocalists, harmonised guitars, interesting basslines and pounding drums.

Their debut EP 'The Keep' was released on bandcamp in July 2012 and can be found at http://flamefracture.bandcamp.com. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Flame+Fracture">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
