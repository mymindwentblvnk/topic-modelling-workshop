SYSTEM SHIT is an old school Crust/Hard Core band From Halifax, NS, CANADA! And no we are not a Politically correct band we just don't cater to the racist sexist homophobic types,Theres already to much hatred in this fucken world.

We started as a joke, noise-core band back in 1988 and evolved into what we are now. We've been through a million line up changes and have recorded 12 demos. We've got four 7 inches out (KILL THAT FUCKER, HELL-O and a split with BLOODY PHOENIX and a new one with CLUSTERFUX.)

We also have a 12 inch split out with HUMAN ERROR and a split CD with A.S.B.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/System+Shit">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
