CFCF is the stage name of Canadian electronic musician Michael Silver. Based in Montreal, Silver took the name CFCF from the call sign of the city's CFCF-TV.

CFCF's debut LP, Continent, was an impressive collage of vintage electronic textures evoking grandiose landscapes worthy of a Michael Mann film. The River, an EP based partly on Werner Herzog's classic film Fitzcarraldo, deepened a growing obsession with conjuring far-away landscapes and voyages through a style which is at times melancholy, propulsive and ecstatic. Working in genres ranging from house and disco to ambient and new age to rap and R&B, and pulling influences from Peter Gabriel and Popol Vuh to Mr. Fingers and DJ Screw, CFCF's music is at once versatile and far-reaching yet eminently listenable and recognizably pop, and always vivid.

Since these two releases Silver has stayed busy with a series of evolving mixtapes. Do U Like Nightbus? explores the titular "genre" through his remixes of Aaliyah, Ciara, and Twin Peaks, while Reincarnation presents a dark mindmeld of exotic chants, pounding drums, R&B crooners, and menacing dancefloors. As with his own music, you get the feeling you are embarking on a fantastic journey to an unknown destination.

As a DJ, CFCF has toured across Europe and the Americas in a variety of contexts. He’s DJed with indie acts such as Toro y Moi, Neon Indian, and Caribou, played The Museum Of Modern Art’s PS1 venue with Animal Collective and Oneohtrix Point Never, and performed full-on parties with Hercules and Love Affair and The Juan MacLean among many others.
