Bury Me at Dawn is an Italian band which was formed at the beginning of 2008 from an idea of Valiant (Vox), And* (Drums) & Andrea (Bass) who wanted to create a band which would combine the pace of hardcore with the more intense sounds of metal, inspired by bands of international fame such as Architects & For The Fallen Dreams. 
With the arrival of Vito (Guitar) & Luciano (Guitar) the band was finally founded and has since played in several gigs, sharing the stage with other bands from the Italian scene such as Kernel Zero, Rising Hate, Waiting for Better Days Arcadia etcâ€¦in some of the most popular venues in their hometown, moving their scene also to other locations as their music became known further afield. 
In the meantime the idea was born to launch a self produced EP which was then made in September 2009 and which will be soon promoted with new venues. 
BMAD are continuing to create new songs which will soon be on myspace.com/burymeatdawn
