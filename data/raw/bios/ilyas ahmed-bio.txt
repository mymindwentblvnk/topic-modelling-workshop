Ilyas Ahmed is a multi-instrumentalist born in Karachi, Pakistan, in 1974, raised in in the Northeastern and Middle Atlantic regions of the United States.

Since 2005 Ilyas Ahmed has been blurring the folk, drone, raga and rock realms into a sound that is uniquely his own.

A string of self-released CDrs in 2005/2006 brought Ahmed immediate attention and he soon released landmark albums on Time-Lag, Digitalis, and Root Strata. In 2010 Immune began working with Ahmed first giving his first two albums Between Two Skies and Towards The Night a deluxe vinyl release and then in 2011 releasing a split 7" between Ahmed and Steve Gunn for Record Store Day.

Ahmed's brand new album With Endless Fire was entirely written, performed and recorded direct to analog tape by Ilyas Ahmed in Portland, Oregon.  It is Ahmed's first album since his 2009 release Goner (Root Strata) and continues the much fuller sound presented there, giving us his unmistakable voice with a mix of acoustic and electric guitars, harmonium, organ, and drums.
