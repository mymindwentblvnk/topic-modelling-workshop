The band formed in summer 2010 and these three 17 year olds have been kicking up a stir with some really ambitious sound music. There’s definitely a Joy Division thing in there though I reckon they have a sound closer to that of Echo And The Bunnymen, which is always a good thing in my book. The band are gearing up for their first single and hopefully 2011 will also see some more gigs, to-date they have only done 2 shows! Have a listen to ‘Oxygen’ and be impressed:
