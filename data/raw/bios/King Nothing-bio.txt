King Nothing - Đorđe Dimitrijević - is from Požarevac, a small city in east central Serbia that you could hardly call a punk-Mecca, yet it's mostly known for it's political power-struggles as it was stronghold of former Milošević regime during the 1990es as well as the backbone of opposition movement. King Nothing started Larynx there in 1983, making it one of the first home-made tape projects in former Yugoslavia. Firmly grounded in clear ideological principles, he wanted to make "first music of white youth, completely liberated from negro or oriental music elements" - as he himself has put it. In course of 6 years he released more than 60 tapes in limited editions on his private "LX Music LTD", very few of whom appeared elsewhere, with some featuring on Marzidovšek's Marzidovšekminimallaboratorium <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/King+Nothing">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
