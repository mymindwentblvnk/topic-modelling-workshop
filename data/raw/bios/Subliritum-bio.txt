Subliritum is a progressive epic black metal band from Trondheim, Norway

New album "A Touch Of Death" world release date 15th April 2011

Norwegian Black Metal in the styles of Emperor, Satyricon and other classic bands in that genre. An epic and progressive album that is by far the best release of this black metal genre on the label.  Squeezing a bit more death metal into their melodic black metal frame, as well as some hints of thrash, Subliritum come up with an impressive work of epic, melodic extreme metal. Features Keep Of Kalessin members Vyl (session drums) and Thebon (guest vocals).

Subliritum was founded back in 1999 and released the highly acclaimed symphonic black metal album “Dark Prophecies” on Evil Horde Records in 2001. The band released the progressive EP called “Dark Side Of You” in 2004, but was shortly after put on hold because Torbjørn (Thebon) and Vegar (Vyl) wanted to focus on their band Keep Of Kalessin. In 2007 the rest of the members decided to reform with a new line-up and started to write new material. This time the band has taken the music to a new level with epical, brutal and grim black metal with elements of thrash and technical death metal. We assure both our old and new fans that you can expect a great album. 

Current Line up:
Jonas Moen-  vocals
Sverre Berntsen - guitars
Kristian Moen  - bass, keyboards 
Dag Leistad Müller - guitars
