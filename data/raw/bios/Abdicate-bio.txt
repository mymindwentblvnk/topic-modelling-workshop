Abdicate is a brutal death metal band from Rochester, NY formed in 2008, by Lewis McDonald, Alex Perez, Brian Young, Rich Buzzell, and Richard "Yeti" Kirk. Abdicate released the demo "Argument of Kings" just weeks after starting out and was released by Sevared Records on the Sevared Demo Series. After a long stint of shows with other great bands, (Suffocation, Dying Fetus, Deicide, Decapitated, Devourment, Mortician, The Faceless, Brutal Truth, Decrepit Birth, Pigsty, Jig-Ai, Cannabis Corpse, Malignancy, Master, Monstrosity, Splitter, Abacinate, Dysentery etc.) Finally in 2009, they recorded the first full length entitled "Forged in Ruin" also released on Sevared Records. Shortly after "Yeti" would step down from the band and Juan Perez (formerly of Agiel) would take the realm of vocals. After a tour, some fests, in 2011 they recorded they're second full length, Transcend Through Sacrifice" again on Sevared. Going in a slightly different direction, with a more straight forward brutal death sound, they have honed they're sound and are ready to devastate the world! In 2014 they released "Fragmented Atrocities" on Sevared Records, once more steamrolling rolling through 8 tracks of brutality!! 

They released a full-length on Severed Records titled 'Relinquish the Throne' in 2008.
