Swedish chanteuse Casja Siik is something of a unsung gem in Nordic music. With glitter-gulleted vox and indie panache she churns out stunning melodic content and rocky twinges. 

Hot off the back of releasing her latest studio album ‘Contra’ in October last year, Swedish singer-songwriter Cajsa Siik stepped into 2015 with the announcement of three new singles, “Follow You Down” (as featured on Criminal Minds), “State Of Low” (as featured on The Royals) and “Change Of Heart”

With ‘Contra’ receiving unanimous acclaim from the likes of Noisey, NME and BBC 6Music, Cajsa Siik has now looked to cement herself as one of the standout voices for the year ahead. While ‘State Of Low’ showcased the effervescent side to her production, ‘Change Of Heart’ aimed to challenge her vocally. Together giving a retrospective feel to her sound as a whole.

With comparisons to fellow Scandinavian’s Lykke Li and Robyn, Cajsa Siik’s transcendent voice, accompanied by ethereal and harmonious production, has helped her stand out from the so-so vocalists of today, and enabled her to gather a solid fanbase at home and abroad.

Media has been all in favor of Siik’s latest releases with pieces in Q Magazine, MTV Iggy, Nylon Magazine, The Guardian and BBC6 Music to mention a few. Cajsa also got her own 30 minute radio special on national Swedish radio – that alone tells us something about her current status in native Sweden. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cajsa+Siik">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
