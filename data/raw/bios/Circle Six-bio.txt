Circle six began as an experimental noise project in 2005. It has evolved to incorporate IDM and industrial influences and uses those styles to mold comfortably into many genres without being restricted to any one. The sound is derived from intimate interaction with low-level software sound environments that help to lend a unique perspective to composition and design. That sound then finds a new voice when redefined in live performances.
