Dirty Woman is a Stoner- rock/metal band that was created by guitarist Edson Alemán (former Atoxxxico, Invectiva, 34-D and Tusken Raiders). The first line-up counted with the participation of Alfonso Brito on vocals, Ray Orta at the bass and José Antonio Fortul on the drums. All of them recorded a 4 song EP entitled “First Party”. 

In 2009 Dirty Woman found a stable cohesion with their definitive line-up: Aside Edson Alemán, DW is now formed by Ángel Castillo (former Faded Mortar) at the bass, Lutz Alexander Keferstein (former Blood Soaked and Arkhé) on vocals and J.C. López (former Tusken Raiders) on drums.


Thus the band has continued their shows on diverse forums and festivals from Mexico City and the Mexican province getting great critics and acceptance by specialized magazines like R&R and Stonerrock Mexico, as well as, even more important, from the crowds and Stoner and metal scene.

The sound of the band is diverse. Being classified among the Stoner world, their music is characterized by riffs that find a resemblance with those musical structures of blues and Hard Rock from the 70´s (strongly influenced by Grand Funk, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple and Led Zeppelin) but with a hevier sound.  Influences of the NWOBHM, street rock such as AC/DC’s and the density of Thrash and Power Metal can as well be easily found.

Aside, the listener can recognize the heavier classical rhythmical and mammoth riffs of Stoner, since Dirty Woman’s members enjoy the music of Corrosion of Conformity, Spiritual Beggars and Down.

Last december, Dirty Woman launch “Demon Lover”, their second material. The album is OUT NOW!
