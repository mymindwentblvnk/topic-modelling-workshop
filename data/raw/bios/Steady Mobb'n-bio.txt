Steady Mobb'n was a rap group composed of Californian rappers, Crooked Eye and Billy Bathgate who were signed to Master P's No Limit Records in the late 90s. The duo first appeared on Master P's single "If I Could Change" in 1997 and shortly after the group's debut album Pre-Meditated Drama was released. The album was a success and made it to #29 on the Billboard 200 and #6 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums. The following year saw a follow-up album entitled Black Mafia, but it was a huge failure only making it to #82 on the Billboard 200 and the group was released from No Limit. Dispite being released, the duo stayed together and released two independent album, 2001's Crime Buddies and 2003's Espionage, before disbanding.

Billy Bathgate then changed his name to "Bavgate" and is now signed to Thizz Ent., he has made numerous appearances on compilations released by the label. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Steady+Mobb%27n">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
