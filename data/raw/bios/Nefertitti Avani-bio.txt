Singer/Songwriter Nefertitti Avani was born in the heart of Cleveland Ohio. The late Howard Johnson, her grandfather, was a member of the Original Ojay's but decided not to be a part of the group because he wanted to be Lead singer. Like her grandfather, she decides her own path. Her father, singer/producer, introduced her to music at the age of ONE. She could play twinkle twinkle little star at the age of two. Grandmother Almitra Hakim, responsible for introducing the city of cleveland to African dance, was one of the first to push Nefertitti into stage performances. Nefertitti was on television by the age of eight dancing and singing on a very popular morning show. By age nine Nefertitti had a book full of songs all self written. Because of all of her life obstacles, including a near death experience in Atlanta Georgia in 2009, she has always had an interesting approach to her compositions that seem ahead of her time. Nefertitti, which means, "The beautiful one has come" really lives up to her name with a bright spirit and music that will last a life time. This timeless artist is capable of all genres of music and specializes in pop and r&b. Avani, which means, "Gods gracious gift" is her destined name and a perfect fitting description of what she will be to the world.
