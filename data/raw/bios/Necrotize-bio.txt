Necrotize bridge the gap between metal and death with a hybrid sound of metal grooves, chugs, death blasts, thrash rhythmns and even occasional black metal elements.

With a new release due in 2010 through Dissected Records, Necrotize are upping their game since 2007's EP 'Death Comes To Us All', and are hell-bent on destroying audiences all over with their fierce live set!
