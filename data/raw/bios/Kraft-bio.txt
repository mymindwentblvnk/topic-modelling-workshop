There are, at least, five artists known as Kraft: 1) A lusitanian black metal act. 2) An Helsinki experimental folk duo. 3) A pseudonym of DJ, Pavel Kraft. 4) An ebm Spark! side-project. 5) A pseudonym of London DJ, Philip Anim.

1) A lusitanian 'black metal' act, born from the ashes in 2001 and raised by feelings of depression and misanthropy that fill our music from the very first day. We praise bands like Nargaroth, Burzum, Graveland, Shining, Darkthrone and many others for the inspiration but non the less our music is unique and we're proud of it. Black metal is not dead as long as we keep the spirit alive inside of us.

Releases: "Lusitanian Pride" (2001), "Twilight Halls Of Sorrow" (2002), "Black We Stand At The Dawning Moon" (2003), "And The Lands Turn Dark" (2004), "The Ruins Of Time" (2005) & "Where Lost Hope Dies" (2006).

2) An experimental folk duo (from Helsinki, Finland), who made their debut in July 2005 at the Time Of Music festival in Viitasaari. The duo strives for genre-free musical communication and expression. Sounds are produced with a variety of instruments ranging from fiddle and accordion to live electronics, glockenspiel and the human voice. Kraft performs all sorts of music for people who love music of all sorts.
