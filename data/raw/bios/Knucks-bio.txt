Knucks (born Ashley Nwachukwu on November 12, 1994) is a British rapper and producer from South Kilburn, North London. He is currently signed to his own independent imprint No Days Off (also known as NODAYSOFF CC LIMITED).

In the early 2000s, Knucks lived in inner-city London and became interested in grime music, and would perform 8-bar relays with friends during and after school. As a teen he realised he wanted to be a musician. In Year 8, Knucks went to a Nigerian boarding school, where his love of music developed further. When he returned to London at age 14, KnuckS discovered Nas and Curren$y and transitioned from grime to rap. He performed in front of an audience for the first time at age 16 or 17, at an open mic night hosted by Regent Studios in South Kilburn.

Throughout these years starting from 2012, Knucks has rose to 'the British rap elite'. During this time, he formed his own label/brand, No Days Off. In 2014, he released his debut mixtape Killmatic, the title being a play on his hometown Kilburn and the Nas album Illmatic. The next year, he released the song 21 Candles on Soundcloud, which propelled him even further into having a career.

After a series of singles from 2015 to 2018, Knucks would sign a deal with Young Entrepreneurs Records and Island Records, releasing his debut EP NRG 105 in May 2019. A year later, Knucks would go back to being independent, releasing his second EP London Class in September 2020.

Knucks received even more recognition with the release of the Breaking Bad-inspired single “Los Pollos Hermanos” in 2021. His debut album ALPHA PLACE was finally released in May 2022, featuring guest appearances from Stormzy, SL, Sainté, Youngs Teflon and Ragz Originale. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/KnuckS">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
