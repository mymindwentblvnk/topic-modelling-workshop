The story of Moon Over Culm begines back in 2004, when we've started in line up: Gromm, Dreamerion and Buli. Few people have passed through the band and the final line up is Gromm, Dreamerion and Etanalath. Our inspiration comes from whole slavonic and local tales. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Moon+Over+Culm">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
