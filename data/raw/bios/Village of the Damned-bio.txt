This is not an artist, but appears here due to incorrectly tagged soundtracks. If this non-artist appears in your charts, do last.fm and yourself a favour. Fix your tags by putting the actual artist name in the artist field. The easiest way is to use MusicBrainz Picard. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Village+of+the+Damned">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
