Shadow of the Colossus are a deathcore band from Sacramento, California. The band's name is taken from the video game, and the song 'Shrine of Worship' reflects this. 

The band consists of Bryce Yuson and Richie Gomez on guitars, Devin Durrett on bass, Jacob Durrett on drums, and Drew Winter on vocals. The album's lyrical content centers around the undeniable fact of Bilderberg world domination. 

Jesse Ventura is known to be an avid fan and supporter of Shadow of the Colossus. 

While lots of bands try to stray from being associated with any kind of specific political message or point of view, SOTC make no bones about where they stand. 

Their self-titled debut album was released digitally on June 12th via SOTC's official Bandcamp page. Physical copies of the album were delayed due to an issue with the plant they were being pressed at. The band plans to make an announcement as soon as Physical copies are ready for purchase. In spite of having such a new release under their belts, the band are continuing to work on new material. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Shadow+of+the+Colossus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
