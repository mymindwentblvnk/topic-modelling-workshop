In 1998, Nosferion, Satarius and Aras tried to find a drummer in order to make an extreme metal band, they found Comte Acrius and Livor Mortis was born, a Black Metal Band. Things remained the same that year and afterwards Necronos joined the band but didn t stay a lot of time in the band because he wasn t motivated enough and couldn t devote it much time. It s only in 2000 that Livor Mortis made his first gigs and recorded its first 4 track demo: The Flames of Hate In 2001 we decided to fire Aras because of lack of motivation, he was replaced by Thror. Some months after his arrival, Livor recorded a second demo: Splendor Mortis which enabled the band to make more gigs in belgium and some france. During January - February 2003, the third demo: Astre des Tenebres was recorded. In august 2004, Chapitre XIII, the new MCD was recorded. It was pressed and limited to 500 numbered copies. Some changing appeared once again on vocals. Thror went away for some personals reasons, of time and motivation. He was remplaced by Lord Lokhraed (Grim Landscape - Nocturnal Depression (F))
