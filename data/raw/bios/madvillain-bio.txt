Madvillain was an American hip-hop duo consisting of two MCs and producers, MF DOOM and Madlib. Their debut album Madvillainy was met with wide critical acclaim for its unique approach. Their short songs, obscure lyrics and sparse choruses made for a sound that was generally unfriendly to commercial radio, but was lauded as a key aspect of their identity as an underground act.

In 2006, Madvillain was featured on Stones Throw Records and Adult Swim's DVD/CD Chrome Children with a new song and live performance. Kidrobot followed this by announcing a Madvillain action figure.

On May 26, 2010, Madvillain released the song "Papermill" via Adult Swim's website. On January 3, 2011, Madvillain released the song "Avalanche & Victory Lap" via Stones Throw mixtape.

On 31 December 2020, Dumile's wife posted an image of MF DOOM on Instagram and Facebook stating that Dumile died on 31 October 2020 at the age of 49, which was later confirmed by his representative. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Madvillain">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
