---------------------------Bio---------------------------

Hailing from Brooklyn, Silent Killer (Sean S.) has already proved himself as a serious force to be reckoned with, following with the release of debut album "Everyone Bleeds", available everywhere on CD, iTunes, Amazon, Beatport and every where.
And releases already under his belt on notable record labels such as Outbreak Ltd, Obliterati, Hate, Ohm Resistance, Guerilla, Counterstrike, Algorythm and forthcoming tune with Gein on Human Imprint.
Silent Killer’s style is heavy yet steadfast, keeping you gasping at every break with his signature mind-blowing Reese and hardcore inspired drums. Sean is now blessing dance floors with his chaotic movement of drum n bass. Be prepared for pure damage and plenty of exclusive tracks during this set.
