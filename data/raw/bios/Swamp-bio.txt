3.  http://myspace.com/welcometotheswamp An American sludge metal / swamp metal band. Formed in early 2010, Swamp is a four-member one-man-band consisting of the collective figments of the various musical imaginations of Stephen Hoffman, slowly and painstakingly integrated into a coherent musical form through excessive amplification, anal-retentive drum programming, and the lyrical genius gleaned from hours of extended screaming matches with mirrors. 
Swamp, playing out of Galesburg, Illinois and Indianapolis, Indiana, recently released their debut EP Three Cheers for the Firing Squad – a crushing blend of sludge metal, stoner metal and doom metal, with some hardcore thrown in for good measure; the album has been well-reviewed and is available for download on Last.fm as well as on the band's Bandcamp page.
