There is more than one artist with the name Beggar:

1) A British mod band formed in late 1977 in a Welsh village called Mountain Ash, perhaps most well-known for participating in the 1979 "Mods Mayday" gig in Canning Town, London, England. They disbanded in the summer of 1980.

2) A currently active Christian band that have released their debut album, Scraps of Grace.  Inspired by both biblical text and real-life experiences, Scraps of Grace brings a new voice to Christian music. 

The band received rave reviews after playing for the National ELCA Youth Gathering in San Antonio, Texas.  Incorporating conventional rock with pop undertones to a Christian genre, Beggar has engaged youth from around the world.
