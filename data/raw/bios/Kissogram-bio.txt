Kissogram is a German electronic  band  founded in Berlin, DE in 1999  by Jonas Poppe (vocals, guitar, keys, programming) and Sebastian Dassé (keys, programming) .

After a few singles and an EP on some independent labels, the group signed in 2004 with Louisville Records , a Berlin indie label , and has released so far three full-length albums and various singles .

(Currently the band is unsigned after Louisville Records announced bankrupt in March 2010.)

Live shows have always been an important part of the band’s activity, both as opening act (Kissogram have opened gigs for Peaches, Franz Ferdinand and other artists) and as main act.
In 2008, drummer  Joe Dilworth joined the band. 

Kissogram’s music has been labelled through years in many ways , and it’s difficult to exactly insert it in a single genre because their sound influences come from many different styles, but we could mainly describe it as a synth pop / electro rock with a markedly vintage ‘80s touch.
