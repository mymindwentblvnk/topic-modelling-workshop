For many music lovers, the divide between classic rock and contemporary metal has remained vast, with few bands capable of capturing both the untamed wildness of bygone eras and the focused energy demanded of current heavy metal. Motherload have come to bridge that gap!

The bandâ€™s formation occurred when four friends stumbled upon the realization that they shared a vision more similar than they
first thought. Oz and Tom forged a friendship several years ago but initially continued pursuing independent goals until it suddenly became clear that their separate pieces belonged to the same puzzle. Likewise with longtime friend DC and trusted powerhouse Esson, who were recruited on bass and drums respectively.

Monstrous riffs and instant choruses arose naturally from the determination to forge well-crafted compositions. This is a path the band are keen to maintain, always striking a balance between musicianship and big, anthemic rock. Motherload are now in the process of unleashing a new beast upon an audience of passionate rock fans who know what they want and have waited patiently to receive it. Drawing on the influences of British greats such as Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin, as well as the powerful offerings of Metallica, Pantera and even the finer moments of Bon Jovi, Motherload have developed a unique hybrid blend of timeless rock.
