Brazilian progressive metal band Anaxes was formed in 2005 by the guitarist Bruno Pinheiro Machado and the drummer Thiago Caurio, with the intention of creating an instrumental group to play covers of classics of their genre.

With the addition of the vocalist Guilherme Antonioli, the new line-up performed many concerts throughout the South of Brazil, receiving great response. After that Benhur Veira Lima (vocals/bass) and Cassio Vianna (guitar/keyboards) joined the band.

After recording their first demo in 2006, Anaxes had great exposure in the music scene due to the high technical level of their songs, making good melodies without losing the feeling, some of the marking characteristics of the group, which received great feedback from the main rock/metal magazines.
Right now Anaxes is recording its debut album, which shall be released in 2009. More details will be available soon. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Anaxes">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
