OLD CHAPEL is an orthodox sepulchral squad spreading the infection of old school doomed death metal since 2010 under the leadership of Pavel Suslov (vocals) and  Sergei Karpukhin (drums). Based in the city of central Russia called Ivanovo OLD CHAPEL was known in underground with two unholy releases â€“ 'Tales from the Churchyard' and 'Symptoms of Possession'.

In the end of 2016, after several years of silence, the chapel has opened the gates again to unleash all the demonic creatures dwelling and waiting inside. Inspired by old horror movies and witching rites, the band tells nine chilling stories of horror, decay and possession through their newest album 'Visions from Beyond' (Chaos Records, CR-049). Among the prevailing uncompromising fast-temped tracks  'Visions from Beyond' also incorporates some measured dismal chants in a doom metal vein. Oppressive sound, catchy lead-guitars and bleeding vocals form chilling atmosphere of the album making you feel buried deep under the floor of old cursed chapel.
