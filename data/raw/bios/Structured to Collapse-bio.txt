Since it's birth in the spring of 2007, Structured To Collapse has strived to bring something different into the world of death metal. Structured To Collapse is a band that brings it's own style to the table which reflects the dark and harsh times that one is forced to live in! Structured To Collapse throws a crazy yet organized choas to your ears with a positive but fierce attitude! The band is strongly influenced by all of their fans as well as all genres of music and everday bullshit that we can all relate to. This only pushes them to push harder and harder to get there music out to the masses!!! After putting out a demo in the summer of 2007, the band is now ready to record again after many member changes and will be in the studio soon with a new line up that will literally melt the skin from your faces!!! Structured To Collapse plans to go on a full US tour possibly in the early spring so keep your eyes pealed for the explosion awaiting to happen possibly in your own town!!!  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Structured+To+Collapse">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
