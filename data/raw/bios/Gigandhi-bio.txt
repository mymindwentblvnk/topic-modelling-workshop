Gigandhi was an underground metal band from Copenhagen, Denmark formed in 1991. Their music was similar to the post-metal of Neurosis and the industrial metal of Godflesh and Red Harvest. This, together with being influenced by Indian Classical/Hindustani music and culture, lead the band to calling their own music 'Hindustrial'. They released two albums; Rafflesia in 1996 and Chaaval in 1998, as well as several demos. They split in 2001. 

Gigandhi sometimes played under the pseudonym Elephandhii for alternative live performances that differed from their usual live shows as Gigandhi. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gigandhi">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
