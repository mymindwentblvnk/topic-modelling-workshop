KHEPHRA is a musical project born in the mid-nineties. Initially, the training consisted of: SHADOW (guitar), Andras (voice), Draughar (drums). Before recording the first demo, Shadow left the band for personal reasons and was succeeded in his place Arioch. Recorded demo ( "KHEPHRA") even Arioch reluctantly left the band for reasons relating to the study, and instead took over Alastor. With the new line Andras (voice), Draughar (drums) and Alastor (guitar) we recorded 8 new songs, never published, and now we are looking for some labels eager to publish, are 7 songs by PURE BLACK METAL, fast, high-impact . <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Khephra">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
