Abominat: Norwegian death metal band formed in 2002. The first demo "Deadworld" was recorded in 2004.
A 7" EP was recorded in 2006 and released on No Posers Please! Records. In 2007 a couple of new tracks were recorded and a "somewhat unofficial" promo was made with the new songs and some older ones on it. Abominat will be featured on an upcoming 7" series from Relapse Records, but the band split up in early 2010.
