Bento Mc is 20 years old and lives in Munich. He starts to freestyle just for fun when he was aged 16. Last year he began to write his raps down, but he was not able to record it. Since June 2006 he is recording his stuff with a headset and a program called "Music Maker". He was born in Recife/ Brazil, so he is also Portuguese speaking, this is the reason for some Portuguese parts in his tracks. For sure he have to buy another mic, to get better qualities.
