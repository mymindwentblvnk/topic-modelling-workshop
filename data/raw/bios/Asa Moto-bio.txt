Hailing from the suburbs of Ghent, Asa Moto are Oli and Gilles. They first arrived on DEEWEE with the ‘Stay Awake’ / ’Wanowan Efem’ double header. They are back with a new E.P produced alongside Dave and Stephen Dewaele. 

’Systema Naturae’ utilises old school stabs in a modern fashion over slow-mo sound, ‘Make Me Prada’ brings large sound melody, ‘Athina’ is off-key funk and ’Syriacid’ is modern in a classic fashion. 

In June 2018 their third EP appeared on DEEWEE, this time delivering six radically different pieces of music, providing something for everyone. Dance floor : covered. Kitchen: covered. Hi Fi: check. Car: sorted. EarPods: done. Up to you to find out which one was made for which.
