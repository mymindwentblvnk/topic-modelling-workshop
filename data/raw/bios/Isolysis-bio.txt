Isolysis began life in 2005 and enjoyed extensive live shows all across the UK gaining fans wherever they went. In late 2007, after the recruitment of Dan Monic in the position of lead guitar and during a break from live performances, Isolysis set themselves a gruelling, yet thoroughly enjoyable schedule of extensive rehearsals and writing new material. March 2008 saw the welcomed return and debut performance of the new, improved Isolysis.

Taking the UKâ€™s live music scene by storm and with regular radio play on digital and internet stations in the UK and across Europe, Isolysis are enjoying every moment. Gaining fans and notoriety they are fast becoming a force to be reckoned with.
