Inferialis was a famous gothic/doom metal band in the moldavian underground metal scene, despite only having a very limited rehearsal tape with two tracks :
1. Broken Piece of the Sun (6:59)
2. It was a Yarn (6:05)

After the band split-up in 1998, vocalist Petru and keyboardist Dan went on to form the disco band O-zone which sold millions of discs all over the world, and released big hits like the "Numa numa" song. Petru was kicked out in the early days of O-zone, because two "better-looking" guys were needed. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Inferialis">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
