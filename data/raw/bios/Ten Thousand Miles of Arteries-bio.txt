2) The West was Nothing but a Dead Beast (2008)

Sol Y Nieve released a compilation of the two demos called 'Exorsa' on cassette in December of 2010. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ten+Thousand+Miles+of+Arteries">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
