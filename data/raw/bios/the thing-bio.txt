The Thing is a Norwegian/Swedish jazz band, consisting of Mats Gustafsson (saxophones), Ingebrigt HÃ¥ker-Flaten (double bass), and Paal Nilssen-Love (drums).
The trio was established in February 2000 during a series of concerts in Stockholm and a recording of Don Cherry-compositions that was released in Sweden by the label Crazy Wisdom/Universal. Melding German, British and American traditions of free music, their repertoire has later been collected from various sources such as James Blood Ulmer, Frank Lowe, PJ Harvey, White Stripes, Lightning Bolt and Joe McPhee. McPhee was also a participating musician on the "She Knows..." album (2001).
"Garage" was released on the Smalltown Superjazzz label in 2004. An EP of live material performed with Joe McPhee and Cato Salsa Experience was released in 2005, as well as a live album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Thing">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
