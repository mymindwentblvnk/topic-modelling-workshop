Merauder, a groove metal/metalcore from Brooklyn, New York. 

"The fucked up part is we named it what it was... metalcore! Of course we don’t see any PC aka money for any of that, you know how it goes. Seriously we are not going to take credit for metal being in hardcore, there was always some kind of metalish band in the NYHC scene, but we were not your typical metal band, weren’t a dime a dozen, that’s fo’sure and we talked it like we walked it. From the first singer to Sob and me, we were actual real ghetto kids not dudes whom moved there for a lil bit. No, were born and raised Brooklyn NY ghetto Latinos and that is what Merauder is, straight up band! Always been! Now as for the scene we had a lot to do with the so called hardcore bands sounding metal, but I don’t label them hardcore! I don’t label Merauder hardcore, because we're not and never tried or have been. Misinformed people do. Merauder is metalcore, period." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Merauder">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
