What do you get when you take a woman from Langley British Columbia, of French and Greek descent, whose early exposure to music came by the way of Nina Simone, Billie Holiday and Portishead?

Sophia Danai, a singer/songwriter described by ION Magazine as "a multi-faceted artist" with music that is both cinematic and soulful. Enter Chin Injeti, two time Grammy Award winning producer for artists such as Pink and Eminem; One day, on Facebook, Chin sees a charming video of Sophia playing her Electone organ in her parents basement. He is blown away. Immediately he was in touch and history is soon to be made. Many songs later, including collaborations with DJ Khalil, THC (Kendrick Lamar), Talib Kweli, and Shad K, to name a few, Sophia Danai's debut EP, 'Wishing Well' is now available from The Hastings Set. https://itunes.apple.com/ca/album/wishing-well/id628122072

The latest issue of her magazine, also entitled "Wishing Well" is available, featuring some of the artists aforementioned. The magazine uniquely outlines her personality the way that her music does; it is thoughtful, imaginative and compelling. http://issuu.com/wishingwell
