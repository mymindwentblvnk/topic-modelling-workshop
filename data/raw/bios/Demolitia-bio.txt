Demolitia is a self classified "Beer Metal" band from Chambersburg, Pennsylvania.  The band was formed using the pieces of a local Chambersburg act called Shame's Parade.  After various changes and replacements in the beginning Demolitia found their groove and took shape in the form of: Brandon 'Tank' Sherman on vocals, Andrew Hawk Davidson on guitar, Shawn Hann on drums, and Tyler Gervasio on bass.  After 2 years of writing, playing, and recording Gervasio decided to part ways on good terms and was later replaced by Greg Burkholder.  Although the lineup change occured shortly after the recording of their second CD 'Wreckoning' the band continued to play local shows throughout their tri-state region.  After a brief hiatus at the end of 2009 the band is currently working on new material and a new live show experience.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Demolitia">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
