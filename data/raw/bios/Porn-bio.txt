1.) PORN is a French industrial-rock band, founded in 1999. After releasing their first album, "Glitter, Danger & ToyBoyz", the band went on hiatus for several years, reforming in 2009. Since, they've released a compilation of their first ten years of music, "A Decade In Glitter And Danger", and a new album, "From The Void To The Infinite".

2.) Porn (The Men of), or Porn, is a San Francisco band founded by leader Tim Moss. Moss is joined by Dale Crover (Melvins), and Billy Anderson. Richard Goodtimes, from San Francisco, is good friends with Tim Moss. Tim Moss is the leader of Porn. It should be clearly stated that Richard plays an important part in the band 'Porn' and in the life of Moss. Many collaborations and ideas spring from late night conversations between these two, resulting in an abundance of ideas for songs and future tours.

Porn toured with the Melvins on their Double-Drumming Rock for Peace tour at the end of 2006. A new album is planned for the near future.
