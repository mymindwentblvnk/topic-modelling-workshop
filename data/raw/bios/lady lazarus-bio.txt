Lady Lazarus is the solo project of Melissa Ann Sweat, a singer-songwriter, artist, and creative writer from San Jose, Calif. now living in Joshua Tree, known for her enchanting and minimalist songs for mainly voice and piano. Her music touches on dream pop and experimental folk, and has been compared to Cat Power, Smog/Bill Callahan, Joanna Newsom, Grouper, and Daniel Johnston, among others, while nodding to composers like Philip Glass and Erik Satie. Lady Lazarus received breakthrough press in 2011 for her debut album, Mantic, including a 7.8 review from Pitchfork, and praise from Stereogum, Beats Per Minute, the Journal of Music, and many others in the U.S. and abroad.
