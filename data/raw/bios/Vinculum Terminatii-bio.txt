VINCULUM TERMINATII is a one-man melodic doom metal act from Providence, RI USA.

Vinculum Terminatii blends Swedish and Finnish influenced melodies with thick somber rhythms, and deep doom growl vocals. On two tracks on the "Omnis Decido" release, Megan Vogt joined to offer her haunting vocal style to compliment the VT material.

Nicolas AKA Brutalnet (Instruments and Male Vocals) also has or has had associations with Lecherous, Botulism, Goratory, Fuckfest, Spectral Effect, Irradiant Sunset, and Acephalus.

Vinculum Terminatii announced in March 2007 that the first full length CD entitled "Forever. The End." would be released in 2008. The CD was released electronically in September of 2008 and is nearly 80 minutes long. The CD was remixed and the name was changed to "Perpetuum" in 2009 for a limited electronic-only release. There was no physical release of the CD, but it has received rave reviews.
