Mourners Lament is a Funeral Doom Metal band hailing from Vi√±a del Mar-Santiago, Chile. Being familiar with the chilean Doom Metal scene, with fellow doomsters like: Uaral, Mar De Grises, Poema Arcanus or Bitterdusk, these guys don't disappoint at all, keeping that almighty chilean doom flag attached to the top of the Andes. Crushing yet melodic Funeral Doom, in the vein of Evoken, though Shape Of Despair or Comatose Vigil influences are present. Recommened to the fans of the afore-mentioned bands.
