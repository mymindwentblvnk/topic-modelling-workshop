Since then, were composed the musics that would be in the CD Wonder, recorded in the summer of 2005. In October of the same year, HB begin a tour, playing in festivals like: Outubro Negro, Ad Aeternum Fest, and others... Due to changes of the band members, HB was in stand by during some time. Now HB it's able to return to the stages with new members and new songs. COME AND SEE OUR WONDERS!
