Beyond Mortality(Not to be confused with the thrash metal band from Sweden) is a Progressive Death Metal band that formed in early 2009. With influnces such as The Faceless, Jason Becker, Periphery, Burning The Masses,The Black Dahlia Murder, Allan Holdsworth, Guthrie Govan, Beneath The Massacre, All Shall Perish, After The Burial, and Within The Ruins; Beyond Mortality has a sound that blends the genres of Jazz Fusion, Neo Classical, and Death Metal altogether in one. Beyond Mortality has been playing shows locally for over a year now and are looking to soon play more and hopefully out of town. In December of 2010 the first single Maximus (Mover Of Planets) was released to show a preview of their new sound. An Ep is in the works of writing and hopefully will be out in 2011.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Beyond+Mortality">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
