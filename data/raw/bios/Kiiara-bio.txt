Kiara Saulters (born May 24, 1995), known professionally as Kiiara, is an American singer and songwriter from Wilmington, Illinois. Her debut track 'Gold' was released in June 2015 to some acclaim, peaking at #13 on the Hot 100 in October 2016. Her second single, 'Tennessee', was similarly well received. 

Slightly left-of-center pop artist Kiiara is a breathy vocalist whose output falls somewhere between that of Jhen√© Aiko and Lorde. Born in May 24, 1995, The Wilmington, Illinois native previously recorded as Kiara Saulters and independently issued the homey acoustic pop song "Bring Me Back" in 2013. Eventually signed to major-label Atlantic, she worked with the Cataracs' Niles Hollowell-Dhar and David Singer-Vine, as well as Brenton Duvall and Felix Snow, and recorded Low Kii Savage. The EP, which alternated between downcast electronic pop and bass-heavy, trap-style rap production, was a radical change in direction. Preceded by the breakout single "Gold," it was released in March 2016.

The following year, she appeared on the Linkin Park single "Heavy," which broke into the Top 50 of Billboard's Hot 100 and peaked at number two on the Hot Rock Songs chart. Later that year, she issued the singles "Whippin" with Felix Snow and "Wishlist." After featuring on Cheat Codes' 2018 track, "Put Me Back Together," Kiiara released her own single, "Messy."  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kiiara">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
