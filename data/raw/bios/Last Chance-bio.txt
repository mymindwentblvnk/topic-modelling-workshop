There is more than one artist with this name:

1) Last Chance are a hardcore band from the Central Coast of Australia.  The band formed early 2010 in San Remo. The band has little experience but have a goal set, "To make music they would want to listen to" and to support their local Hardcore scene.

2)
The Last Chance was a straight edge hardcore band based across northern England. The band played their last show @ 'edge day' in Sheffield on 22.05.2004

They recorded a 7" for AM Records and a MCD for Dead & Gone Records which kickstarted that label. A full length was planned but the usual band bullshit scuppered that and the band died on its feet. A final 7" was released called 'Where We Stand'. It has the sound of a band on its way out.


3) 
Last Chance is all about the old school punk rock with a positive message. Gaining a respectable fan base up and down the west coast, support from college radio and landing on prime shows has helped & encouraged them to record their first full length album. Recorded at Pus Cavern in Sept 05' by Sacto favorite Joe Johnston, the album "Messages & Slogans" will be out Feb 17th 2007 and will be talked about for years to come, soo be sure to check them out at their next show soo you can tell everyone you saw them first.


4) Also there is a pop-punk band from Almaty, Kazakhstan

5) RAC/Oi! band from USA. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Last+Chance">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
