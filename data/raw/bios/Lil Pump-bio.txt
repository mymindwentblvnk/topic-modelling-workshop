Gazzy Garcia (born August 17, 2000), known professionally as Lil Pump, is an American rapper and songwriter.

Born in Miami, Florida, Garcia rose to popularity late 2015 via music sharing website SoundCloud, gaining millions of streams on the site. 

Lil Pump's rap career started when he met now frequent collaborator and friend Smokepurpp. After Pump was expelled from school for fighting in 2016, he was asked by Smokepurpp to free-style and a beat he produced, which we now know as Lil Pump's debut self-titled single.

The track, alongside follow-up hits "Elementary", "Ignorant", "Gang Shit" and "Drum $tick", became successes on the aforementioned streaming app SoundCloud, garnering millions of listens.

The rapper burst to mainstream success the following year with the Diablo-produced track "Boss", which apart from also achieving millions of SoundCloud listens also peaked at #101 in the USA.

The following single "D Rose" collected a great amount of attention primarily thanks to its Cole Bennett (also known as Lyrical Lemonade)-directed music video, which at the moment has over 175 million views on the video platform YouTube.

Garcia is best known for his song Gucci Gang which peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100.

The rapper currently has two albums: his self-titled 2017 debut and "Harverd Dropout", which followed in 2019.

Lil Pump and fellow Miami rapper Smokepurpp co-headlined the "No Jumper" tour in 2016, and he has also performed at Rolling Loud. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/LIL+PUMP">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
