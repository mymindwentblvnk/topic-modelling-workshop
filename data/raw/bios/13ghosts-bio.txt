The core of 13ghosts, which takes its name from the William Castle horror flick (filmed in Illusion-O!), is duo Brad Armstrong and Buzz Russell, who trade off vocal and songwriting duties throughout the album and whose voices and influences often contrast dramatically.

13ghosts was formed in 1990 under a different name, and lasted a few years before succumbing to the excesses of being 21. Though the members remained friends, they were spread across the country and didn't make music again until the death of the bass player in 1998. The original inception of 13ghosts was Brad Armstrong and Brett Russell sitting in the basement with guitars and loose ties after the funeral, trying to write a record about their friend. Though this record was never released, it inspired them to put together a lasting group. They built a studio with Andrew Vernon and began recording.  Sammy Boggan joined on bass in 2000, and Jason Lucia joined on drums in 2003. The band self-released two albums and two EPs, then in 2004 agreed to release a hand-numbered, limited pressing of Cicada with Skybucket Records. Cicada was re-released on Skybucket in a standard format in fall 2005. Their newest album The Strangest Colored Lights was released on Skybucket in 2008 was rated 7.6 on pitchforkmedia.com.

The bands members are: Brad Armstrong (guitar/vox), Buzz Russell (guitar/vox), Sammy Boggan (bass), Jason Lucia (drums), Andrew Vernon (controllers, sounds, loops)
