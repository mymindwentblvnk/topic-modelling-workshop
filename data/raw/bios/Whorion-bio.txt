Whorion was formed in 2009 by Ep Mäkinen to make metal that cracks bones, but at the same time having powerful symphonic elements. The vision was clear - to create a feeling that the listener is being sucked into the dark matter of space, slowly waiting for the world's end.

After a few years of composing, training and mastering new style of playing, material started to come together and Whorion was ready to get reinforcements. At the start of 2013, Iiro Illman and Dorian Logue joined the band and the first release started to get fired up. The last link was added when Ari Nieminen came across and nailed vocals with a deadly blow. And Whorion was born and constructed in the way that it was visioned from the start.

Later additions were made for their debut release Fall Of Atlas by young talented drummer Ukri Suvilehto and composing masters Vili Itäpelto and Jussi Kirves, who made the vision of symphonic elements come true. With this brutal, symphonic path, Whorion marched towards the dark future.

Ahead of the release of the EP, Whorion was joined by the last member to complete the circle. A man from the colder northern paths....Heikki Saari, a legend in his own trade and one who brought such dynamics to the band.

On January 17th 2014, Fall Of Atlas was released and took the band on a path where there is no return. A few months after its release Whorion toured the United Kingdom to spread the word on a headline tour.

On April 24th 2015, Whorion will release their debut album The Reign of the 7th Sector.
