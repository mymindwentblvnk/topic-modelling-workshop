Bergtagen was formed in late 2006 by Jon Rosenthal. Beginning in the realm of ambient and neofolk, Rosenthal desired for Bergtagen to expand, adding black and doom metal to the mix. 2007 saw the addition of Mike Fioretti on guitar, soon to be replaced by John Becker (who also plays violin), Mike Nelson on bass, and John Sharpe on drums, soon to be replaced by Velnias's AJS.

After two years of inactivity, Bergtagen was ended April 19th, 2009. Jon Rosenthal now makes minimalist electronic music in Luminescence. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bergtagen">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
