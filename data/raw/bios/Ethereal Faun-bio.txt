Ethereal Faun was formed in Spring 2007  by Francesco Capomagi and guitarists Lorenzo Marcelloni and Marco Parlapiano. The group's goal was to create music that mixed Folk, Progressive and Death elements with Melodic Metal. The trio was soon joined by drummer Alessandro Manoni and vocalist Marta Pierdominici.

Ethereal Faun's songs combine several influences including folk music in the form of  fiddle, flute melodies  and acoustic guitar as well as energetic metal riffs and female vocals.  Death and progressive metal elements are also present in the form of heavy screams and instrumentation.

After playing a number of live shows the band released their debut Demo in April 2008 which  included a mixture of  original tracks and covers. Their debut album "The Nightlitany" featuring exclusively original material  was released on March 21st 2009 to coincide with the Spring Equinox. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ethereal+Faun">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
