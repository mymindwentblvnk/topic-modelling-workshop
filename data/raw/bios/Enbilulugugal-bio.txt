Apokalyptic experimental black noise band from California, USA formed in June of 2000 by two scumbags known as Izedis [R.I.P.] (Vocals, Bass) and Nebiru [R.I.P.] (Guitar). They soon set out to destroy ears, minds and speakers with their insane vision of Frostfucked Black Metal Goatsodomy. After about a million demos, Nebiru left the band and TheCoprophiliac (also of Necrobestiality) replaced him. Another million demos later and one Full-Length, TheCoprophiliac decided to fukk off and Alcoholonomicon from Blood Cult and Tjolgtjar forced his way into the band to vomit out shithot guitar licks. After that, the booze and drugs kicked in and not much is known.

The band was finally laid to rest for good in early 2020 with the passing of Izedis. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Enbilulugugal">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
