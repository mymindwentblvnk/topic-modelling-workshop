Violet Days is the electronic pop project of Swedish singer/songwriter Lina Hansson. Born in a small village in the countryside, Hansson was raised in a musical family, singing Swedish folk songs with her siblings and finding inspiration in the Beatles, Michael Jackson, Coldplay, and the Sounds. In 2010, she made the move to Stockholm to pursue music. Initially, Violet Days -- named after her grandmother Viola -- had an edgier sound, with first single "Razorheart" sharing similarities to Demi Lovato or Kelly Clarkson's pop/rock anthems. Slowly, the sound shifted to include more ethereal textures and a focus on synths, evidenced on 2015's pensive "So Dope." That same year, Violet Days released "Screaming Colors," an explosive synthesis of their rock and synth sides. Along with collaborator Kris Eriksson, Hansson scored her first notable hit with 2016's "Your Girl," which would be streamed over five million times. With vocal delivery and atmospheric soundscapes similar to contemporaries like Daya, Halsey, Zara Larsson, and Tove Lo, Hansson followed "Your Girl" with "O.D on You." In addition to issuing remixes, Violet Days also recorded a mashup of Michael Jackson's "Dirty Diana" and Rihanna and Calvin Harris' "This Is What You Came For." In early 2017, "Suck at Love" was released. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Violet+Days">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
