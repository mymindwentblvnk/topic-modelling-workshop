There are two bands named Raid:

1) vegan straight edge metalcore band that formed from the ashes of the Christian metalcore band One way. Along with Vegan Reich and Statement, Raid pioneered the hardline movement and ideology. 

Their music was loud, fast, hardcore that was as uncompromising as their political beliefs. Not to mention being an artistic expression of their stance against for drug-free living, gender equality, anti-racism and animal liberation. Their output started as fairly conventional hardcore punk, which gradually evolved to incorporate elements of heavy metal and effectively became spokesmen for the Hardline movement.

In 1989, they self released a demo tape and this led to a seven-inch single called Words of War a year later through Vegan Reich's own label, Hardline Records. The band split as they moved away from the straight edge lifestyle, but not before recording some session singles tentatively titled Above The Law. It was released posthumously in 1995 by Victory Records, titled Hands off The Animals.
