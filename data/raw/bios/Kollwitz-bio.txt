A chilling, post-punk metal breeze, straight out of Bodø in Northern Norway.

The band started out in 2006. The members all had connections to the once blossoming hardcore scene in Bodø (The Spectacle, Uzumaki, Hjertesorg, The Fences, Oceanism, Cold Mailman). They started somewhat anew with Kollwitz in Oslo in 2007. After many years of being herded in such a remote – and thus highly unique – scene as the one in Bodø, their Fysisk Format-released debut album “Like Iron I Rust” resulted in great reviews and Kollwitz making a national name for themselves. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kollwitz">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
