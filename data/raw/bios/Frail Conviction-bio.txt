Frail Conviction is a greek metal band, formed in 2005 by Alexandros and Iraklis. The first demo "Whispers In Sorrow" was recorded in 2005 with the great help of Nikos D. (Symphony of Night). However all guitars and vocal tracks were re-recorded in 2008 and a new ... hopefully improved version is available.

You can also download their demo in their website  Frail Conviction Homepage  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Frail+Conviction">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
