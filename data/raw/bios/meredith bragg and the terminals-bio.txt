East Coast singer-songwriter Meredith Bragg (http://www.meredithbragg.com) crafts atmospheric chamber pop with an indie rock sensibility. Bragg is often supported by his longtime backing band, the Terminals, usually consisting of cellist Elizabeth Olson, drummer Jonathan Roth, and keyboardist Brian Minter. The Kora Records released their debut, Vol. 1, in 2005. The five-song Departures EP followed in January of 2006. Meredith released his first true solo album, Silver Sonya, in December of 2007. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Meredith+Bragg+and+The+Terminals">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
