Twilight Fauna is a one man atmospheric metal band from Appalachia. Constantly pushing the boundaries between genres, multi-instrumentalist Ravenwood uses a variety of traditional folk instruments alongside conventional black metal guitar work and primitive drumming to create a unique blend of blackened folk metal. Since forming in 2011, Twilight Fauna has released multiple full lengths, EPs, and splits including the much acclaimed Hymns of a Forgotten Homeland. With songs steeped in atmosphere, Twilight Fauna is one man's deeply personal vision into the history of himself and of the mountains of his birth.
