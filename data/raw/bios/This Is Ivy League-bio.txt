Ryland Blackinton had written a few songs which were heavily rooted in bossa nova and folk music. Alex Suarez quickly learned the songs and brought a cohesive poppy edge to them. The culmination of the two styles produced a folky-pop sound that both were pleased with. This was the basis of their first single, “London Bridges,” which was released by indie label Twentyseven Records in 2006. Their debut full-length was released April 1, 2008. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/This+Is+Ivy+League">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
