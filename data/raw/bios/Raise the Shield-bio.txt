Raise the Shield is currently a one-man heavy metal outfit from Indianapolis, Indiana, USA. It is helmed and guided by principal songwriter, performer and multi-instrumentalist Dave Cardwell, who produced his first demo release, "Shocked Awake" in August 2006. This was followed up two months later by the release of his full-length demo "Play With Fire" which blends American and European traditional metal with high-class musicianship and a modern thrash edge. He has since released a second full-length CD in January 2007 entitled "Release Yourself" exploring the technical side of metal without sacrificing intensity and melody. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Raise+the+Shield">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
