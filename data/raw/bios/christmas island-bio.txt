Hailing from sunny San Diego, California, Christmas Island's music is happy and poppy on the surface, yet there is a dark undercurrent to their brand of lo-fi pop punk. Simultaneously joyous and almost twee while secretly depressed and deeply disturbed. Citing Tronics, Urinals, Television Personalities, the Clean, Versatile Newts and The Fall as influences, Christmas Island are Beach Boys style pop by way of the late 70's- early 80's UK DIY scene. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Christmas+Island">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
