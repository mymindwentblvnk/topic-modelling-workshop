One of the most unique and exciting bass music outfits to emerge in recent times, Koven is the production alias of producer Max Rowat and Katie Boyle.

First conceived in December 2011, the Koven project was sparked into life with the ‘Wake You Up EP’. Instantly making an impact across the scene, Koven’s very first release saw support from some of the most influential tastemakers of the time, including UKF and Inspector Dubplate, Ministry Of Sound, Radio 1, XFM and more. 

After making a name for themselves with the free 'Wake You Up EP' and remix work, in March 2013 the time had come for Koven to drop what was unbelievably their debut release. Released on Futurebound's Viper Recordings, an outlet renowned for its ability to find new talent, 'More Than You' announced Koven as a new, formidable force on the EDM radar. A blend of melody, contorting bass and the unforgettable vocals of Kate Ashton, 'More Than You' solidified Koven's style, earning them even more new fans and over 1.5 million views in the process. The single featured remixes from Drum and Bass dancefloor kings DC Breaks and support from Radio 1's Zane Lowe, 'More Than You' began the next phase of Koven's rise in the dance music scene.

Whilst completing remix duties Koven also worked with Ministry Of Sound producing a track for Hadoukens album and Nissan's collaborative project 'The Nissan Juke Box'. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Koven.">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
