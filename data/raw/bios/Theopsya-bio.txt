In 2006, Theopsya was born in Toulouse (France).
The band has undergone changes but finally hold steady and lay the basis of Theopsya. Clementine Rico ( lead singer), Tanguy Jacquemier and Pierre Bedos (guitars), Remy Alarcon (bass), Esther Perli (keyboards) and Nicolas Sordello (drums) hold the place of this frame. Playing heavy metal along with strong melodic parts is the band's main will.
A demo has been recorded in 2007 with this line up, the band played many local gigs during this time.
Few times later, due to personal reasons related to studies and distance, some members left the band and Theopsya finally has to split for a while.

In 2010, Nicolas and Remy decided to reform Theopsya and came to find a constant line up quickly.
Manon Civial (lead singer), Adrien Salado (guitars), Pascal Guehl (guitars) and Nacht (keyboards) join the band between march and June 2010.
A revitalized Theopsya is then setting up with a writing style rhythmically more progressive with death influences (mainly due to both guitarists influences), while keeping the melodic roots layed by former members.
The band played several shows in 2011 and especially reach the Emergenza Finale contest in june at "le Bikini" and gave support to the symphonic band Whyzdom during his tour in November.
Late 2011, in partnership with "Les sons du silence", the band released an EP called "Tales of an Angel" that includes 7 titles with old and new songs.
Mid 2012, the band has to separate from Nacht and Pascal, respectively substituted by Julien Badier (from Simeria) and Julien Commerenc.
Today the band is working on new materials in order to release its first album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Theopsya">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
