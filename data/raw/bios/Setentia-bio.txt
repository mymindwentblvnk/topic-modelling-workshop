Setentia formed in Auckland New Zealand circa 2009. Characterized by their heavy aggressive layering of distorted dissonance & somber clean sections, the six piece has established themselves as one of the younger emerging innovators of death metal in New Zealand. 
Tirelessly working over the course of six years the progressive death metal circuit has announced the coming release of their self produced Debut Full length album Darkness Transcend. Spanning shy of an hour and covering a vast territory of styles and mood, Darkness Transcend delves into the personal journey of the members themselves to render a sense of purpose within the music. 
Having shared the stage with the likes of Ulcerate, Psycroptic, Aborted, Black Dahlia Murder and Dawn of Azazel, Setentia has shown sonic prowess amongst New Zealand.
