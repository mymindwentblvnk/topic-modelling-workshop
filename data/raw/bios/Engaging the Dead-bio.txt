Biography
Formed in Winter of 2007, Engaging The Dead is a 5 man formation band from Oporto, Portugal, with a single goal to create blistering music in the art of death metal, blackmetal and progressive metal, which can even rise forth the dead from their graves with the craving need to ascend to the afterlife, for the desire of flesh and devourment of every soul.
Engaging The Dead has a yet to be released EP 'Unholy Harvest', recorded, mixed and mastered at SOUNDVISION studios, in Vila do Conde, Portugal, produced and engineered by Paulo Lopes and Engaging the Dead.
