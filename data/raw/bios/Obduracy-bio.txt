Obduracy is the result of a relentless and enduring dedication to creating devastating, unadulterated metal. Inspired by a desire to mold an aggressive, unforgiving, and genuinely evil sound, founding members Jeff Udall (Fumigation/Drillpoint) and Nick Miller(Sonburst/Drillpoint) on guitar, with Steph Desilets (Drillpoint) on drums, began crafting the style that would become Obduracy in summer of 2010. That September, Evan Curtis (Afflicted Faith) moved from Winnipeg and quickly started contributing. Finally, after a long search and many auditions, Dean Desarmia (Syncytia/Epocholypse) rounded the group off in March, adding demonic vocals the to bandâ€™s already dark sound. Characterized by a crushing sonic palette and just coming off a debut album, Obduracy is prepared to take on all challengers. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Obduracy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
