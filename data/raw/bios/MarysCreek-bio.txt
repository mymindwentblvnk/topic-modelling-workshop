MarysCreek was founded by Mats Nilsson in early 2004 with the goal to start a powerful band that would make a noise in the world. The first member to join Mats in the line up was Stefan Halldin, a hard hitting drummer with lots of attitude and energy. Around August 2005 the third member of MarysCreek came along with Robban Möller, a heavy grooving and dynamic bass player. After having found guitarist Bobby Ho and with his know how, history and musicianship, the band was complete. 

They gained live experience and acquired appreciable reputation within the Swedish live-scene by constantly touring Sweden and presenting themselves with a powerful and convincing stage show, for example together with Uriah Heep, The Poodles and From Behind. In December 2005 MarysCreek began to record the tracks for the debut album “Some Kind Of Hate”. Guitar based melodic rock and heavy groove, successfully delivered in a big sounding modern production with sweet sounding, melodic songs.

After having finished the recordings they started collaborating with famous Swedish producer Fredrik “Fredman” Nordstrom (In Flames, The Haunted, Dream Evil) to mix this powerful debut album. The worldwide release of “Some Kind Of Hate” is scheduled for March 2007.
