Frost Commander is a heavy metal band formed in Warsaw, Poland in 2010. Their first attempt to reach the local underground audience was release of EP "Magic Dagger" in 2011 which was followed by numerous gigs played across Poland.
After couple of personal changes band reformed in 2013 and managed to record "Destination Unknown" single followed by full length album "Invincible" which was presented to the world on Spring 2014.
With elements of speed metal and melodic power metal "Invincible" brings back the old school power metal presented in 80's by the bands like Omen, Virgin Steel or Liege Lord: Rumbling percussion, harmonizing guitars, epic guitar solos, melodic, epic vocals and a solid bass work. It also comes with the stories told about thrilling encounters with insanity, meaninglessness, all-too human motives and the sheer unintelligibility of the universe on anthropomorphic terms. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Frost+Commander">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
