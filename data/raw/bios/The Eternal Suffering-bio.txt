After a short period of live shows The Eternal Suffering entered the studio to Record their first self financed Album entitled "In Darkness We Shall Reign".The mastering of the album took place in Tampa-Florida in the famous Morrisound Studios by Jim Morris himself and gave the band amazing reviews from all over the world.Once again the press hailed the band and voted In Darkness... as the release of the month in Metal Hammer,soon to be followed by 4 more webzines. Several live shows took place all over Greece but unfortunately the band came to a pause due to military obligations of its members. Currently a 4 track promo is being recorded in order to get the band back running.
