In 2007 five men gathered in the lower regions of The Netherlands to form Burn the Iris.

Deriving inspiration from a vast variety of great bands such as The Ocean, Isis and Burst, while at the same time confronting mutual differences, the band initiated the creation of aggressive, catchy grooves of their own.

At the end of 2007 they recorded their promo CD and in 2010 the ‘Sovereign’ EP saw daylight.

The press described their first recordings as "tight as hell, various as a roller-coaster" (Fret) and claiming they “...mercilessly pound with aggression, tempo changes and some truly epic moments” (Terrorizer). With their new material everybody is in for even more heaviness! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Burn+the+Iris">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
