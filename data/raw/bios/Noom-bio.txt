Noom is an abomination. They are not interested in your realities, theirs is subverted. They are perverted, young, decadent but symmetrical. They love silver liquids. Their eyes are green on a black background. So much talking produces even more talking: “And the word is rotten meat!”

Noom is a provocation. Be insulted, those with spoilt ears. Their musick is a sound circumcision. They circumcise you, “baptize” you, while you alone nail yourselves on the cross.

Noom is a liquid. They are biological, dense and viscous, with no additives. They bet on their own fleeting. They are not afraid of fermentation and putrefaction.

Noom is irrationality. They are not masters of themselves. The subject is an effect of language, the means how people fill the void of the Symbolic. They are this void. Do not try to fill them! Do not ascribe them. Abandon your expectations. They will always disappoint you.

Noom is a ritual. They are the sound that cuts your throat hoping to never awaken again. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Noom">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
