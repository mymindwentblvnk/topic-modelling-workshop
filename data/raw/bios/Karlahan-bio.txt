Karlahan is a symphonic metal band from Barcelona (Catalonia) which mixes metal with lots of different influences, from melodic death metal, black metal to progressive metal. Now the band consists on 5 people: Toni González (growling vocals), Aleix Valverde (drums and vocals), Sergi Nuez (bass), Jordi Bolibar (lead guitars) and Guillem Rejón (guitars and vocals). 

The band started with a more folk direction, but this changed and now they are developing a more mature style experimenting with many different styles. Karlahan participated in December 2007 in the recordings of the  new Equilibrium album called "Sagas" as a guest band. Their first album is called "A Portrait of Life" and has been produced by their scottish mate Scott McLean (Falloch) and Karlahan's guitarist Jordi Bolíbar. The album has been released in September 2009. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Karlahan">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
