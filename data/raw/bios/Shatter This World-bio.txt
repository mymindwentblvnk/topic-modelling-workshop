Shatter this World was formed in the Winter of 2006 from two previous local bands. This five piece band's sole objective is to write catchy aggressive music. Shatter This World has accomplished numerous goals and will continue to persevere. 

They have been fortunate enough to work with some of the biggest names in the scene. During the fall of 2007 Shatter This World entered the studio to record their first self titled 6 song ep with jonny Fay, ex-The Red Chord. In early '09 they did a 4 song ep with Ken Susi of Unearth entitled "Shit Out of Luck". 

With an outstanding lineup, a high energy live performance, and love for the metal scene, Shatter This World will continue to make a name for themselves. Keep an eye out for big things in the future! 

"Metal Mayhem continued when New Hampshire's Shatter This World assaulted the studio with their heavy and melodic 6-Song EP in September. If you're into melody, breakdowns, double bass and ridiculous guitar squeals, you'll want to check these guys out.

The Reverend (RTTP): 
"Shatter this world: ultra tight playing. And they are recording with a really good friend of mine, mr kensusi.com. When ken tells you to put a breakdown in or play your guitar behind your head, you listen. Kensusi.com once stopped me (cause we are really good friends) and he said "you need a breakdown right here" and you know, he was certainly correct. Anyhow, these guys were the height of the moshing just like one would expect."  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Shatter+This+World">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
