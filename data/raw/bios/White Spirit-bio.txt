White Spirit was a British band that included Iron Maiden guitarist Janick Gers. Other members of the band were Bruce Ruff (vocals), Malcolm Pearson (keyboards), Phil Brady (bass), and Graeme Crallan (drums, also see Tank).

White Spirit were part of the NWOBHM (New Wave Of British Heavy Metal). The band, originally from Hartlepool, released their first 7" single "Backs to the grind" on the independent heavy metal label "Neat". The B side for this single was "Cheetah".
White Spirit then moved to the MCA label on which they released their first and only album in 1980. The album was simply titled White Spirit. One of their songs, "High Upon High", is also included on the Metal for Muthas Volume II: Cut Loud compilation. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/White+Spirit">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
