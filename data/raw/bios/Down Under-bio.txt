Down Under is a melodic metal playing band hailing from Lahti, Finland. The band has already been to studio for a few times despite their young age. 

After a couple of line-up changes, Down Under seems to have found their final form. Jonne Lyden - vocals, Matti Kyllonen - bass, Joni Nordman - guitar, Ville Kaipainen - guitar, Henri Nordman - drums.

During the winter of 2005 Down Under's first demo was published. "Sick Descriptions" consists of four songs; Mirrors, Callous We All, Maggots Within and This Is How It Ends.

The band has stopped playing together after all these years. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Down+Under">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
