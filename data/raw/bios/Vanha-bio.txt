Vanha, meaning "Old" in finnish, came to existence on one summers evening in 2016.
Originally formed by Jan Johansson (Vocals/Guitars/Keyboards),
as a sideproject to explore the most depressive, darkest & heaviest of sounds.
As the first 2 songs of a demo was made, "Read The Scars", Jesse Oinas joined
on drums.
Later on, getting a deal with Black Lion Records, a full production was made,
called "Within The Mist of Sorrow".
7 tracks of death, agony, heartbreaking darkness & depression.
Heavy hard-hitting drums, roaring bass & guitars, the beauty of piano, various strings, 
& pipe-organs, all combined with dark growling and clean vocals.
Line up:
Jan Johansson - Vocals/Guitars/Keys
