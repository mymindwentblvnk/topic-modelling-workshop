Daniel Pearson (born 2 July 1982) is an English musician and songwriter from Kingston upon Hull, England. He has released to studio albums as a solo artist, and plays guitar, bass guitar, keyboards and percussion on his releases.

Blending elements of indie rock, alt.country and classic guitar pop, Pearson's immediately accessible songs deliver the emotional connection and honesty that only instinctively great songwriting can provide. His soulful vocals and finely-crafted songs have found themselves on the airwaves of BBBC 6Music, BBC Introducing, XFM, Amazing Radio and Australia’s biggest radio station Triple J. Writers for Uncut Magazine, Drowned In Sound, Shout 4 Music, Pop Matters, R2 Magazine, AllGigs, Sabotage Times, For Folks Sake and No Depression have been quick to celebrate the arrival of a new voice and have drawn comparisons to Ryan Adams, Bob Dylan and Ben Howard in a series of rave reviews for his two albums Satellites and Mercury State.

Already a veteran of rock n' roll and punk bands by his early-twenties, Pearson had toured up and down the UK and released various singles and EPS before going solo in 2010. After deciding to maintain his artistic independence away from the machinations of a larger label, Daniel has become a very successful example of the new music industry – an artist that maintains control over every aspect of his career, has a real connection with a loyal and growing fanbase and competes for press and radio coverage with acts with huge marketing budgets through the simple strength of his music.

A compelling live performer, Pearson has shared a stage with acts like Michael Kiwanuka, One Night Only, The Bluetones, Willy Mason and Josephine as well as playing a string of headline dates of his own in the UK and USA. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Daniel+Pearson">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
