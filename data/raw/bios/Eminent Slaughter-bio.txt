Eminent Slaughter, formed in late summer of 2011, consists of guitarists Jamie and Ted along with bassist Dylan, drummer Andrew and vocalist Nick. In July of 2012 they were chosen to open the last day of the Central Illinois Metal Fest. In late August 2012 Ted left the band to pursue his personal endeavors. Eminent Slaughter then recruited Dave, though his stay with the band did not last long. He left the band at the tail end of November 2012 and was replaced by Chris, a great player who adds a refreshing new presence to the band. Together as a band Eminent Slaughter have played over 15 shows in one year of existence and create a sound combining their personal influences that is both unique and brutal. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Eminent+Slaughter">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
