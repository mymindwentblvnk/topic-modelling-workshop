Started from the remnants of the Fort Myers hardcore band Sonofabitchmustpay, this band developed by influences of both local artists, and sheer fury. Mixed with moments of both intense emotion and said aggression, comes a sound that's both unique and familiar.

2)Enchiridion - Melodic Death Metal Band from Germany. The bands first step was set by singer and guitarist Louis with his solo-project „Dawn of Descent“. Because of the melodic Deathmetal-ejaculations, which were influenced by bands like „Kalmah“; Louis was able to establish a small international fanbase.
After 4 years of searching, he finally got supported by Philipp, Tobias and Stephan. These three men discovered the potential of „Dawn of Descent“ and joined the project happily. Soon after, a new name for the band was found - „Enchiridion“.
The quartette instantly started working hard and thus, after only half a year, the first EP „Silent Death Curse“ was released in June 2014. The EP contains newly recorded songs of „Dawn of Descent“ as well as new compositions.
