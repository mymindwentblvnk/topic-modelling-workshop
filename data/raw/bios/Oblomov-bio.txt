1) Czech black/death/experimental band founded in 2000. Currently two men project. First demo ("The Final Destination") recorded in the same year, followed by the "Wishing The Renaissance" EP released in 2003 on Radiation Noise Prod. Full length album "Mighty Cosmic Dances" was recorded in late 2004 and released following year by I.F.A. records in Czech Rep. and by Deepsend records (CM sublabel) worldwide. Third album "Communitas (Deconstructing the Order)" released via Werewolf production in October 2009. The album is strongly inspired by social and cultural anthropology and contains many unusual elements as well as Björnar E. Nilsen of VULTURE INDUSTRIES (Nor) as a guest on vocals in two songs.

The band combines different elements (saxophone, didgeridoo, etc.) with standard death/black metal influences. Important part of their music is programming. The used drum machine on their debut album what brought to it a cold and space atmosphere. The album was inspired by sci-fi and scientific themes.
