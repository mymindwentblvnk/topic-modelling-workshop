Black Eyes was a post-hardcore band from Washington, D.C., United States that existed from August 2001 to March 2004, disbanding two months prior to the release of its second album, Cough. Its members included Dan Caldas, Jacob Long, Mike Kanin, Daniel Martin-McCormick and Hugh McElroy.

Prior to releasing the first album, Black Eyes released a 2 song 7" EP and a split EP with Early Humans. The split with Early Humans features an early version of "Someone Has His Fingers Broken" entitled "Have Been Murdered Again." Black Eyes' eponymous debut album was released on April 15, 2003 through Dischord Records. Most tracks featured the band's trademark dual vocals, from bass guitarist Hugh McElroy and guitarist Daniel McCormick, as well as two full drum kits and the occasional horn blast or synth noise.

After extensive touring with Q and Not U, the band broke up just before its second album, Cough, was released on June 1, 2004, also through Dischord Records. For this batch of songs, the band incorporated frenzied brass instruments into its sound, pushing further into free-jazz territory.

Black Eyes disbanded after a final show at the The Black Cat in Washington, D.C. All of the band's former members have since moved on to pursue other projects, such as Earthen Sea, Hand Fed Babies and Mi Ami. Hugh McElroy has become fully immersed in his DIY record label, Ruffian Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Black+Eyes">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
