Established in 2011 Empyrion is on the rise to spread the crushing truth about humanity’s prospects and poisonous nature – in music and words. The band plays a blend of dark raw death and black metal – or blackened death metal – with technically conceived riffage, pulsating bass, fast drums, massive keyboards and more than brutal vocals. In August 2012 Empyrion agreed on a record deal with Gothoom Productions and released their „Mindshifter“ debut album on 14th December 2012. The album was recorded and mixed in Roland Grapow’s studios in Zvolenska Slatina. Members are: Jan Kozar (vocals), Juraj Glovna (guitars), Rado Glovna (guitars), Edo Farman (bass), Martin Janecek (keyboard / sampler) and Miro Raucina (drums). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Empyrion">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
