Cast From Eden rose from the ashes of the Louisville, KY scene to counteract the seemingly dying passionate roots within the hardcore subculture and to reintroduce the implantation of ideas. Musically metal oriented and predominately influenced by death, Swedish, and black metal, there is still a subtle fusion of hardcore present in both the music and the mind set of the band.

They have had the privelege to share the stage with such bands as Between the Buried and Me, Bleeding Through, Bloodlet, Burnt By the Sun, Caliban, Candiria, End This Day, Prayer For Cleansing, The Red Chord, and Undying. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cast+From+Eden">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
