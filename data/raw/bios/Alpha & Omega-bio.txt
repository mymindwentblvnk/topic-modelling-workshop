There are, at least, two bands named Alpha & Omega.
1) Alpha & Omega are a roots dub duo that mix both analogue and digital elements, comprising bassist Christine Woodbridge and keyboard player John Sprosen, both of whom had played in reggae bands previously, Sprosen also having worked with the Roaring Lion Sound System. They began working together in the mid-1980s, splitting their time between their home towns of London and Plymouth, and issued their debut home-recorded cassette in 1988.
They were picked up by Greensleeves Records, who acted as a parent company to the duo’s A&O label, and also worked with Jah Shaka, for whom they supplied rhythm tracks. Although they are strongly influenced by artists such as Lee “Scratch” Perry, King Tubby and Augustus Pablo, they have developed a sound that has been described as “uniquely British”. In a review of their Mystical Things album, Rick Anderson, writing for Allmusic, wrote: “This prolific London-based duo is responsible for some of the most convincing old-school reggae to come from the first world.” 

2) A Los Angeles, USA metalcore/crossover band, formed in 2007. Influenced by the likes of Cro-Mags, Crowbar, All Out War, Stigmata, Integrity, Leeway & Metallica. In 2008 they released a début EP, “The Devil’s Bed” (6131). In that time, they had toured the US three times & shorter tours, with the likes of Madball, Terror, Internal Affairs, Trash Talk & H2O. They have appeared at This is Hardcore Fest (Philadelphia), Great American Hardcore Fest (Boston), made multiple appearances at United Blood (Richmond, VA) and Sound & Fury (CA). The band makes its first European tour, Oct /Nov 2010.
In 2008, the band released the “Devil’s Bed”, an EP containing three demos and two new tracks. The combination of metal, East Coast hardcore, and their own kind of sound left their fans wanton for the next album release.
“Life Swallower”, the band’s first full length album, was recorded, mixed and mastered at Buzzbomb Studios by Paul Miner, known for his work with the likes of H2O, New Found Glory, Terror, Thrice & Death By Stereo. The album also featured pre-production contributions from Chad Gilbert (New Found Glory), Andrew Kline (Strife) & nick jett (Terror).
Alpha & Omega are currently signed on to 6131 Records.
