Red Warszawa was formed in the 1980's by 4 highschool friends. Their lyrics are mainly danish, but sometimes they also sing in english, german, swedish and norwegian. The lyrics are mostly about young people in trouble, heavy metal, hash, girls and beer.

The band consists of the following:
Heavy Henning - Le guitarre
Måtten Møbelbanker - Le percusionnes
"Lækre" Jens - Le Vokaliste
My Tight Ass - Le Bass-guitarre de l'electrisse


The band is well known for its manic live performances.

They call their music Polish Punk, because their high school teacher showed them a Polish punk band back in the early 1980's. Heavy Henning then decided to found a 'Polish punk' band, even if they had no idea what Polish punk even was. They then came up with the name Red Warszawa, which is referring to the Communist government in Poland at the time, and the wrongly translated word for Warsaw in English, thinking it was the same as in Danish (Warszawa).  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Red+Warszawa">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
