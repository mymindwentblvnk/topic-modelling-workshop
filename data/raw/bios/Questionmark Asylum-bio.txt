The 4 members of Questionmark Asylum are Mistafiss, Rosta Swan, Digge Doms, and Ding Ding. You could say that they sound a little bit like Pharcyde, actually most people couldn't tell them apart. They were big local favorites in Washington D.C., but were only hot for a short lived period of time nationally with the release of their single, "Hey Lookaway" on their album, "The Album", released in 1995. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Questionmark+Asylum">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
