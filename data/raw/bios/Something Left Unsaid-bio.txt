San Francisco Bay Areaâ€™s SLU has unleashed onto the California metal scene. Their first EP, " In Memories Of Blood" is available now iTunes, Last.fm, Big Cartel, etc.

This release is the culmination of extremely hard work beginning just this year, in March 2010, when two close friends began sending tracks back and forth over the internet. Soon the band was solidified and have been working nonstop across California.

SLU's style appeals to metal fans across the board by blending heavy riffs with melodic harmonies and strong vocals. Having played hundreds of live performances between members, SLU is sure to not disappoint.

The band is currently on tour through Jan. 2011.
