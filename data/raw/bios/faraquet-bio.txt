Faraquet are a math rock band formed in Washington D.C. in 1997. They released their first EP on DeSoto Records and then eventually released a full length on the DC label Dischord called View From This Tower. The band broke up due to artistic differences in 2001 but have since reformed in 2007 to tour Brazil and the United States (see dischord.com).  2/3 of the members reunited as another math rock band called Medications after the original split. Devin Ocampo fronts Faraquet, Jeff Boswell plays bass and Chad Molter drums. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Faraquet">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
