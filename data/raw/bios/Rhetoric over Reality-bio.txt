About
Initially conceived in 2009, Rhetoric Over Reality have undergone several major changes in lineup to produce the final 3 piece outfit you see today. Our approach to writing has always been to make music that we would want to listen to ourselves, but constantly pushing our skills as musicians. Citing diverse influences as broad as Dream Theater, Mastodon and Frank Zappa we attempt to bring varied styles to produce edgy tracks which tell a story and do not always proceed in a predictable manner. This has led to the anecdotal tag that we are 'a band for bands'. We don't aim to re-write rock/metal, just to approach it from a different angle.

And no... we don't need a singer. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rhetoric+Over+Reality">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
