There are several artists named Igneous.

1) Igneous was an early Norwegian Death/Black Metal band which disbanded in 1992.
They released two demo tapes:
1991 - Dark Side
1992 - Anti Amen

2) Igneous are a band from Callander in Central Scotland. Their career started and finished at Mclaren High School (2000-2003) where members, Matt Corden (vocals/rhythm guitar), Jamie Scott (Bass), Dave O'Rourke (lead guitar), and Stephen Alexander (drums), created their unique brand of pop/blues/comedy/soft rock. 
They split due to musical differences (dave likes Nickelback and Limp Bizkit), Stephen's lack of motivation to rehearse, and Jamie's desire to play guitar in his new band Miss Molly (now known as Boyfriend/Girlfriend). 

Now, in 2006, Jamie and Matt are working on a new project catalogueing the Igneous 'best of' with new recordings (replacing Stephen with a drum machine and Dave with a synth). The compilation is called 'Igneous Suck Dick' (Chris, from one of their contempories 'Recc', wrote this on the Igneous lyric jotter). This album is arguably their greatest work to date.
