Drawing on elements of soul, jazz and R&B to create a clean and lyric-driven style of bedroom pop, Lucid State is a musical duo comprised of vocalist Ben Northam and guitarist Shayan Fassih. Formed in Oxford in 2018, the pair have since gone on to co-write and co-produce a string of diverse singles, with their first full project 'Talk to Me' dropping in February. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lucid+State">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
