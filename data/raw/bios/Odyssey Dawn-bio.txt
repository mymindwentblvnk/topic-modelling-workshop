Odyssey Dawn, a melodic Heavy Metal band playing Metal in the raw. Not bound by being labelled to a sub-genre, Odyssey Dawn pulls influence from Power, Thrash, Death, or just plain whatever sounds good. Powerful vocals provided by vocalist Alex Madrid, and Kevin Aguilars catchy yet face ripping riffs build the backbone for this band. Michael Moore and Emilio Salinas lend there skills as the rock solid rhythym section the riffs need. Odyssey Dawn demans you listen to them! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Odyssey+Dawn">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
