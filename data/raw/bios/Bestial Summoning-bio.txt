Bestial Summoning was a quite early black metal band from The Netherlands with two demos and a full length. The band was formed in 1991 and had quite a following in the underground scene in the beginning of the 90's. The full-length is fully dedicated to former Mayhem singer Dead, who committed suicide in 1991. In 2002 a compilation of old material was released through War Hammer Records.

On the 8th of August 2008, Conscicide committed suicide on his 35th birthday. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bestial+Summoning">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
