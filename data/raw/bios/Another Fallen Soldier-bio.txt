Another Fallen Soldier is a melodic death metal / metalcore band. They formed in the summer of 2003 by musicians looking forward to do something aggressive but at the same time melodic. Their sound is from a mix of rock and metal with vicious breakdowns along with brutal and clean vocals. The band has a unique style and sound, with the themes of their songs being socially fuelled and personal.

Another Fallen Soldier took the local scene by storm, opening for some of the best metal and hardcore acts such as Nora, Dead to Fall, Evergreen Terrace, Remembering Never, Locked in a Vacancy and Burnt by the Sun. 

Split in 2006.
