Eloise was first drawn to music growing up in rural France, where as a child she began to comb through her parentsâ€™ diverse record collection, take piano lessons and sing in a choir. In her early teens, back in London, she began to teach herself the guitar by mimicking the chord patterns she saw on YouTube. 

By age 17, the artist began to share acoustic covers on Instagram gaining notable supporters including Billie Eilish, Sam Smith and Bruno Major.

Eloise is the definition of wise beyond her years. Ahead of her recently released debut project, Somewhere In Between, the UK singer and songwriter has been recognized by outlets on her home turf as a breakout rising star for her way with words, emotion, and a unique incorporation of classic styles like jazz, R&B, standards, and current pop. With the release of this mini-album, she is truly poised to take the world by storm. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Eloise">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
