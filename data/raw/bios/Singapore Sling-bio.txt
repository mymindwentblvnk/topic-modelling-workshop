Singapore Sling is a shoegaze band from Reykjavík, Iceland. The group was formed in 2000 by singer-songwriter and guitarist Henrik Björnsson, aided by his friend, guitarist Einar Þór Kristjánsson.

Their neo-psychedelia sound has often been compared by the media to acts such as The Velvet Underground, My Bloody Valentine, The Jesus and Mary Chain, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club and Serena Maneesh. Although, in a tongue-in-cheek statement, the band's frontman Henrik Björnsson defines it as "a cross between Simon and Garfunkel".

As of 2016 they have released eight studio albums and a best of compilation. Singapore Sling have supported The Brian Jonestown Massacre on their North American tours and covered "Dirty Water", a 1966 garage rock hit by The Standells in their debut album. They have also covered The Monks' "I Hate You" in the 2006 compilation Silver Monk Time: A Tribute to the Monks.

Singapore Sling was formed in Spring of 2000 in Reykjavík, the capital of Iceland, with the reunion of Björnsson and Kristjánsson. Björnsson had some 8-track demos and wanted to create a band. One of these demos surfaced online in the Iceland Airwaves 2001 official website and later became "Overdriver", the opening track of their debut LP.

While Björnsson is the sole official member, as well as the primary musician on the band's recordings, the live and studio lineup has changed from its original incarnation, and as of November 2015, consists of:

    * Henrik Björnsson: vocals / guitar / keyboard
    * Einar Þór Kristjánsson: lead guitar
    * Ester Bíbí Ásgeirsdóttir: bass guitar
    * Björn Viktorsson: drums

Beginning in 2008, Björnsson participated in the band Dead Skeletons. He also formed a side project called The Go-Go Darkness as a duo with his wife, Elsa María Blöndal. Björn Viktorsson was previously the drummer of Dean Sean and also worked with Glasgow-based electro/psyche act The Cheesemongers. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Singapore+Sling">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
