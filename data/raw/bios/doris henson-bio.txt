Doris Henson formed in the Spring of 2002, and toured to the west coast two months after its full inception. Made up of former collaborators and former strangers, the band featured Byron Collum (Giant's Chair) on bass, Michael Walker (Olympic Size) on guitar, Jamie Zoeller (Chicago's Nymb) on guitar, Wes Gartner on drums, and Matt Dunehoo (Proudentall) on vocals. The band has parted ways, but all members are currently involved in some kind of music project. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Doris+Henson">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
