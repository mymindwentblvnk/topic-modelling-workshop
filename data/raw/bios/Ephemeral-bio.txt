Ephemeral (USA):
Back in the heyday of 99¢ Special, there were many pieces that didn't quite fit the feel of 99. Exit, being the sole creator of 99¢ Special, lumped these other tracks in to various projects, such as LMC, Nature's' Descending, and Ephemeral. LMC got the techno/noise side, Nature's' Descending the more musically inclined, and Ephemeral housed the experimental and noise works.
