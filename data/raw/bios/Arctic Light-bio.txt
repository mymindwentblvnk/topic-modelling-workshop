Arctic Light was founded in early 2006 in Graz by Benedikt Palier (voc, viol), Jakob Neuburg (guit), Martin Hierz (guit), Christian Salchenegger (bass), Leon Leder (drums) and Safet Pehlic (keys).
The stile is hard to define: it's a mixture of melodic black-, folk-, and deathmetal.
The first records are planned to start in Summer 2007.
