Kiln is a Michigan-based ambient trio that is a reincarnation of an earlier ambient group Fibreforms. The trio comprises Kevin Joseph Hayes, Kirk Marrison, and Clark Rehberg III. Creating engaging instances of chroma-sound together since 1993, they have built an expansive discography over the years, exploring the intuitive fulcrum of melodic rhythm & texture within imaginary sound spaces of treated instrumentation. They construct radiantly textured soundscapes that envelope and immerse the listener in a panoramic smudge of chromatic rhythms and syncopated tones.
Their most recent release is "meadow:watt" (2013, Ghostly International).
