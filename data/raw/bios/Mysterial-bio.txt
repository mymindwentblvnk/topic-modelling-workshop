Mysterial is a ritual ambient project from Poland, formed by Rob Darken of Graveland.
"Samhain Mysterium" is a dark ritual performance recorded back in 1995, when the black rites were performed deep in the cursed woods at the old pagan mountain. The song has finally been unearthed in 2012 and appeared on "In to Samhain", a split CD which also includes demo recordings by Lord Wind from the same year. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/MYSTERIAL">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
