Risen from the ashes of thrash metal act Denata, Tomas Andersson and Roger Blomberg teams up with Mique Flesh (ex. Witchery/Seance) and invokes new musical spirits summoned in hell's fire. The idea and hunger for a new project soon formed into what now has been unleashed as Freevil. The idea was to create something diverging from their natural influences and create something new and unexpected. Just going with riffs that felt good – not caring to much where on the metal brutality Richter scale they fitted – as long as they ROCKED in the widest but still deepest sense of the word.

After some intense rehearsal sessions of blood, sweat and fears – ten songs were formed and recorded in the cultural asylum known as Studio HellSmell, where Mique entered the throne as studio engineer.
With a hellish troika of Tomas (guitar/addition vocals), Mique (drums and vocals) and Roger (bass armageddon) their first opus was eternalized/infernalized in 2006/2007. And a fourth character was also brought in to do some additional synths and FX; the spirit of composer Phanatos was also added to heat things up even more - in this tasteful witches brew of raw yet sophisticated timeless metal bearing the sign of Freevil.

After completion of the recording sessions, and detailed mixing early 2007, the material was mastered by Peter In de Betou (Dimmu Borgir, Marduk, Dark Funeral etc) and the material was brought up the last notch of hell's circles, to be unleashed in this demented world known as Earth.

So prepare yourself for some straightjacket fun, some mindblowing sophisticated yet raw – raw yet sophisticated in your face metal that will charm or haunt you…or maybe both! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Freevil">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
