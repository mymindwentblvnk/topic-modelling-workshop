Game Theory was a power pop band which formed in 1982 in Sacremento, California, United States. The band's only constant member was singer and songwriter Scott Miller (vocals, guitar) who led the band through two major lineup changes before he disbanded the group in 1990.

During its career, the band released five full length albums: "Blaze of Glory" (1982), "Real Nighttime" (1985), "The Big Shot Chronicles" (1986), "Lolita Nation" (1987) and "Two Steps from the Middle Ages" (1988). A sixth, "Supercalifragile" was issued in 2017.  

The band's two major lineups were its 1982-1985 lineup of Miller, Nancy Becker (keyboards, vocals), Fred Juhos (bass) and Dave Gil (drums), and its 1985-1989 lineup of Miller, Donette Thayer (guitar, vocals), Shelley LaFreniere (keyboards, vocals), Guillaume Gassuan (bass) and Gil Ray (drums). Interstitial members included Michael Irwin (drums) and Suzi Ziegler (bass).   A lineup consisting of Miller, Ray (who switched to keyboards), Becker's brother Jozef (drums) and The Three O'Clock leader Michael Querico (bass) existed from 1989 to 1990 and re-recorded three older Game Theory for the band's 1990 compilation "Tinker to Evers to Chance" before disabanding. Following the band's split, Miller and Jozef Becker formed The Loud Family in 1991.

After Miller's death in 2013, it was revealed that he had plan to reunite Game Theory to record a sixth album which he tentatively titled "Supercalifragile". In 2016, friends and family of Miller orchestrated a successful Kickstarter campaign to fund the recording of the album with most of Game Theory's former members. The album was released in August of 2017. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Game+Theory">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
