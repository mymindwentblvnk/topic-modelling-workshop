The Phoenix band Dyke & the Blazers picked up on the rhythms, bass and organ innovations of James Brown's band and released "Funky Broadway - Part I" in 1967, the first black dance single with the name "Funky" in the title. "Funky Broadway" was later covered by Wilson Pickett, resulting in a #1 R&B hit.

Originally from Buffalo, New York, the band got stranded in Phoenix, Arizona while backing the O'Jays.

Vocalist Arlester "Dyke" Christian was shot to death in 1971. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dyke+&+The+Blazers">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
