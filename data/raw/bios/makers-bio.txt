At least 2 artists use the name Makers:

1.
Makers is a 5 piece Metalcore outfit hailing from Fresno, California, that was formed in early 2011. With the Metalcore scene that is out there today (which is setting it's foundation on integrity, passion and high energy music), it's no surprise that Makers has and will continue to build a faithful fan base. With the upcoming release of their much anticipated EP entitled "Aliments" (in Summer of 2011), Makers is guaranteed to push boundaries and produce a track list of aggressive hardcore and melodic metal that will set the bar in this ever-changing scene. Fronted by Jacob Bosschieter (ex-ICATCHFIRE), most bands lack the creativity and have the true grit required to demonstrate what it takes to set themselves apart from every other "local" band out there. That being said, Makers has no regrets in calling themselves just what they will be known as: Makers.
