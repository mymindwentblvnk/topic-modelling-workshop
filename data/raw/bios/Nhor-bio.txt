Nhor is a one-man project from Herefordshire, Midlands (UK). He draws influences from forests, mystery, eschatology, astrology, the earth, storms, mist, wind, rain, nature, the night sky, Beren & Luthien, the Starks, loneliness and sorrow. Nhor's music is very difficult to describe, it floats from ambient, neofolk, to doom-laden black metal. 

Nhor has released 2 EP's, 2 books, and 1 VHS. The black metal/doom EP that has been awaiting a release since his first EP is out August 2011.


"These are songs I have written, inspired by black metal. Only listen to them in the dead of night with your eyes closed, alone & with patience." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nhor">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
