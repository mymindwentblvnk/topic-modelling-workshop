"Nephren-Ka (not veiled nod to the great Nile) was born in 2006 when guitarist Florian Christmas and Sébastien Briat (eg Sryknos) combine to put feet on a project in order to play brutal Death Metal and violent, inspired by Hate Eternal, Incantation, Nile, Angelcorpse or Morbid Angel ...

Surrounding himself drummer Pialoux Thibaud, the combo starts dialing and repeat tirelessly. With the arrival of singer Laurent Chambe (eg dislocation) in the group in 2007, Sébastien loose the microphone to devote himself to the guitar. Bassist Alex Phalippon (eg Exhaust) completes the quintet integrating Nephren-Ka in 2008. Auvergne deathsters are finally ready to spit their live music with some local concerts restless, especially with Detorn, Chaos Legion, Lyrside or Bordeaux of Offending .

Having stored the necessary and finally reached a respectable level experience to this style's challenging the brutal Death Metal, Nephren-Ka recorded its first demo Revenge and Supremacy in spring 2010.

Drawing on themes the strange world of Dune Frank Herbert cycle, the Auvergne follow a separate path bathed Science Fiction and intend to demonstrate on stage their resentment and anger!
