A gothic metal band from  the Netherlands founded by ex-Orphanage drummer (Holland's first Gothic Groove Metal band ) Erwin Polderman and vocalist Carla Douw. A charismatic singer with passion in her voice, melancholic and mystical, atmospheric synths and piano, heavy guitar riffs and a groovy rhythm section are the main features of La-Ventura.
Their song "Trefoil" was included in the free music compilation "Songs From The Crypt". In November the band began the recordings for their upcoming debut album, which wes actually mixed and mastered in the USA. All was set in motion to make the release a big success, so finally the debut "A New Beginning" finally was released through Razar Ice Records in the late 2007. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/La-Ventura">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
