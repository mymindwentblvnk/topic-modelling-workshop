Mirkvid's roots can be traced back to 1996 when Graf decided he wanted to start a band with good friend (and current drummer for Bound by Entrails) Seele Mörd. Taking inspiration from bands such as Dissection and Bathory, the duo started composing material under the name of Requiem. The Requiem leagacy had reached fruition when a bassist/vocalist was found, and had started
playing live shows, including a battle of the bands competition in 1997.

Due to "artistic differences", the short-lived vocalist/bassist left the band, leaving it a duo once again. The duo pushed on, changing the name to Mirkvid's Darkness, and recorded the unreleased demo In Arctic Moon. Unimpressed by the unprofessionalism of the producer and unexpected additional studio costs, Graf decided it was time to experiment with home recording devices and techniques,learn to improve his vocals, and, in agreement with Seele Mörd, ultimately decided to go solo. Graf also decided to strip the name down to simply MirkviD.

Graf's first solo recording,the raw Hymns to Mother Night, gained favorable reviews from online metal magazines and most notably, Metal Maniacs. From there he went on to record Lupine Eve, which expanded on the foundation that was laid down with "Hymns..". This featured some of their strongest material to date, and a new focus on composing shorter, more intense songs. Influenced by different styles of industrial music, the next release Transylvanian Backbeat took a turn in a different direction.

Due to the changes, Transylvanian Backbeat was not well received in press reviews, and it was back to the drawing board for MirkviD.

Shortly thereafter, Graf started composing more metallic hymns that would
ultimately be the Sumerland album. At this point in time, an additional
guitarist and synth player named Orlok joined the fold. Sumerland perfectly balanced the raw metal of the early recordings along with the more experimental sounds on "T.B.", and it was only the beginning of the current era.

After a somewhat lengthy break, Graf started writing songs that were in the vein of the old albums. Rather than making a short EP with only a couple new songs, Hymns to Mother Night would get an overhaul and be re-recorded for the new
album The Burning Night. With this album, MirkviD have re-established themselves as a black metal force to be reckoned with. The follow up, Unser Reich only solidified their status with songs that are by far their most intense to date.

In late 2007, Graf made the decision to re-release the classic works with RuneFire Records, and will continue to host his new recordings with them as well.
