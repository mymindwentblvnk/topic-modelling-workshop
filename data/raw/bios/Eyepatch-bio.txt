EYEPATCH, hailing from Arnhem, the Netherlands, started at the end of 2002 and produces loud, uncompromising metallic music. An energetic cocktail of thrashmetal like Darkest Hour or the Crown and metal like Unearth or Lamb of God, with a slight twist of hardcore added especially for the mosh-parts. Guitar-riffs from Hell, pounding basslines, drums as quick as lightning and as massive as Mount Everest coupled with the voice of the Dark Lord himself, EYEPATCH caresses your eardrums and slams you into the moshpit at the same time.
