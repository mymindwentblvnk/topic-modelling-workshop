Formed in late 2007 by Alexander Wyld and Sebb Garner, their aim: to create original sounding 'pagan' metal. Under the name of Aesir, the band played gigs throughout England and Cornwall, and even recorded a bathory cover for a belgium bathory tribute CD. But after several necessary lineup changes, a new musical direction was sought, and so the band decided to make a fresh start;

Morgawr was born.

The Cornish word for sea serpent; Morgawr

The new aim; to delve deep into Cornish and Celtic mythology and to fuse it with black, folk, power and progressive metal.
