Timber Timbre is a Canadian folk music project formed in 2005 and featuring Mika Posen, Simon Trottier and Taylor Kirk.

Their debut album "Cedar Shakes", recorded in a farm house near Bobcaygeon, Ontario, was released in 2006. Hence the moniker Timber Timbre as an ode to the surroundings and the warm haunting sound of the album.

2007 saw the release of Medicinals, an album recorded by Kirk in his empty Toronto apartment. "Cedar Shakes came from driving around in fields, but I don’t think Medicinals reflects the city at all actually," Kirk told the Kingston Whig Standard. "If anything, I think Medicinals is a more fetishization of the rural landscape because ultimately, that’s where I want to be."

Medicinals was released on Shuffling Feet records, the Peterborough based label of Jonas Bonnetta (Evening Hymns), who also mastered the record.

Toronto’s Out of this Spark records released Timber Timbre’s third album in January of 2009. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Timber+Timbre">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
