There are multiple artists associated with the name Slapdash:

1) Swedish groove-thrash metal band. Originally named Atrocity, they went through lineup changes, releasing two albums under the moniker Rosicrucian in the first half of the 90's. They changed their name to Slapdash when Jens C. Mortensen took the roles of vocalist. Released one LP in 1996 named "240.25 Actual Reality". As the band dissolved, guitarist Lars Linden went on to join death/thrash metal band Carnal Forge; later joining forces with Jens briefly.

2) Slapdash was begun in 1994 as Clutter in Los Angeles. The band at the time featured Steven Graff, Brian Taylor and Steve Casa. As gigs came and went, the lineup went through many changes, eventually settling with Graff, Casa, Lee Jossel on drums, and Robert Ramos on bass. 
It was at this point, in 1998, that the band was asked to change their name, going with Slapdash. 
In 2000 Graff acquired the service mark, and after releasing a debut CD "Reciprocal" in 2006, he acquired the US Trademark. Since then, videos have popped up on YouTube, and the band has been releasing about a single-per-month, drawing from a new batch of sessions during 2008-2010. The band shares its name with that of a now defunct Swedish thrash-metal band, which has led to confusion among its new fans. Slapdash is definitely a pop group, and Graff has taken pains in promotion and cover art to draw a sharp distinction with their predecessor of the same name.
Steven Graff is still principal songwriter, and is a member of BMI. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Slapdash">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
