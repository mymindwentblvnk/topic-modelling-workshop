1) Undying was a melodic death metal/melodic metalcore band from North Carolina, USA, formed in 1998. Their blend of fast-paced music and dramatic guitar melody, mixed with crushing breakdowns and screamed vocals became as much a trademark as the band’s poetic lyrics and vegan straight edge politics. Musicianship and an emphasis on songwriting allowed the band to deliver music and message that blur the lines.

Made up of ex-members of Day of Suffering, Prayer for Cleansing, and Catharsis, Undying signed with Fifth Column Conspiracy, who released their debut EP This Day All Gods Die, which went on to sell out two pressings before the label folded. Garnering the attention of Belgium’s Goodlife Recordings, the band’s first full-length, The Whispered Lies of Angels followed in 2000.

Original vocalist Timothy Roy was diagnosed with throat cancer and left the band, replaced by new vocalist Logan White for their 2003 album At History's End.

2) Undying was started in 1999 by Hiraedd with the sole purpose of creating austere black metal of a superior calibre; bleak, cold and grim. One album, "A Haunt Within The Mist" was recorded in 2004, capturing the spirit intended. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Undying">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
