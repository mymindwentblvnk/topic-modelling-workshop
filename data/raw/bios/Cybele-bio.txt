Norwegian goth metal band formed in 1994. The lineup was originally all-female, but, due to many lineup changes during the first years, the lineup was mixed. The band is named after a Phrygian goddess.

The bands first demo got them a record deal, and their debut album received good critics. Cybele toured Europe and played at the very first Inferno Festival in Oslo before they went separate ways in the early 2000s.
