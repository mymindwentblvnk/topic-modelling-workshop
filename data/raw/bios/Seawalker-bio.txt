Seawalker was formed in 2006 by C, following his decision to end his previous solo project Accelera Deck. C was born April 1976 in Birmingham, AL and remains there to this day. The music of Seawalker is written and performed as sonic prayers sung from, and back to, the universe.

Seawalker currently has three recordings available "Every Love Unwinds" CD, "Flower" split 7" picture disc with Broken Letters, and "3 Songs" mini-LP. All were released by Lathelight Ltd and are also available digitally.
