  2. Morning After (1994–2005) was a band which hailed from the city of Lahti in southern Finland. This four-piece hardcore wolfpack plays NYC-styled mid-tempo hardcore with no gimmicks or synthesizer-bullshit. Morning After is all about hardcore, pure and simple. Four guys, enthusiasm and rage.

  3. Morning After (1971) was an English underground proto-punk/heavy fuzz-blues band who only released one obscure and unknown album entitled Blue Blood in 1971. Some of the tracks on the album sound like Blues Rock from the late 1960s and some have a more progressive touch such as Shuttah. Great & heavy guitar work that predicted much of the early '77 punk sound. Fuzz and wah-wah all over the album, snotty and passionate vocals, all own great compositions. The album title Blue Blood assumed a noble wealthy family and a member of the establishment but the music and lyrics are just the opposite. The music on this album is pure British Underground, electrifying, pure and raw. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Morning+After">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
