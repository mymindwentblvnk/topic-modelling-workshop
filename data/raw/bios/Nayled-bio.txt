Nayled was originally founded in October 2002 in northern Germany. The mixture of Metal, Emo- and Hardcore emerged on the Phantom EP (recorded at Soundlodge Studio) in spring 2003. Then the singer changed and Nayled entered the Eikey Studios in the beginning of 2005 to record the new Antibody EP with the help of producer Eike Freese (f.e. Dark Age, Negator, Torment). 

Nayled come around with skills and originallity that shook the scene. Groovy pounding mosh part, emotional choruses and a singer who was more than able to convince in both categories make Nayled the new constant in Germany's Metal- and Rock scene.
