Mothertrucker have been combining the riff power of Sabbath and Kyuss, the quiet menace of Slint and Mogwai and the epic ambience of Isis and Pelican to create a powerful rock onslaught since 2003 and are still rolling. The band have released a number of records in that time, including the album Trebuchet released by Argghh records in France, and have shared the stage with the likes of Boris, Mono, 27, Black Cobra, Jesu, Aereogramme and Truckfighters. A new album of epic material is out NOW!! Dark Transmi55ions. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mothertrucker">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
