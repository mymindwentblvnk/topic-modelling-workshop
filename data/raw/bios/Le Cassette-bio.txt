80s inspired electro/synth pop by Adam McNab (Lead singer/songwriter and co producer), James Nalepa (Producer), Joe Wood (Producer).

Originally from West Yorkshire, Le Cassette’s members are now spread across England, creating 80’s inspired music from a distance. With careful attention paid to the detail in their production, the band has produced some of the most unique tracks within the genre. In addition to creating music that is compelling, thoughtful, and at times playful, Le Cassette distinguishes themselves with beautifully arranged vocals, taking inspiration from Peter Gabriel, Roxy Music, and Phil Collins (and sometimes evoking a young David Bowie). 

With a deep sense of excitement, Telefuture is proud to present Le Cassette’s debut release, Left to Our Own Devices, an album nearly two years in the making. Whether it be the bouncy synth pads, the carefully orchestrated sound design used throughout the album, or the eclectic moods that the release as a whole has created, Telefuture is confident that there is something in this album for everyone. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Le+Cassette">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
