There is more than one artist named Tropics:

1. The man behind 'Tropics' is Chris Ward. Heâ€™s a 22 year old Brit taking influences from 70's jams, post-punk and whatever else he taped in his youth, bringing us the radiant sounds of dreamy, summer nostalgia.

His music has already caught the attention of Pitchfork and XLR8R who have posted up tracks by him, as well as a number of bands including Bear In Heaven and Little Dragon whom he has already remixed. His first EP, titled Soft Vision will be released in October 2010 followed by more singles and an album in 2011.

2. A post-hardcore band based in London, England; featuring ex-members of Rohame, Bullet Union, Meet Me in St. Louis, RAT:ATT:AGG, Navajo Code and An Emergency. Guitarist Jodie Cox also plays for Narrows.

3. A concrete rockabilly band based in Toronto, Canada; composed of Slim Twig (vocals, guitar) and Simone TB (drums, vocals).
