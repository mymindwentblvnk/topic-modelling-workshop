Band was formed in August of 2010 by Danny Ruiz, Jesse Schoof, and Dave Decker. Our first, self released, album, "No Escape" was recorded by Ryan Butler of Landmine Marathon at Arcane Digital Recording in April of 2011. We hope to sign with a label. We want to release our first album "No Escape" through a label or some sort of distro. We're looking to do splits with other awesome grind bands. We're planning on touring. Any promoters, labels, bands, distros, or grinders interested in talking to us or booking us.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/GODawfulNOISE">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
