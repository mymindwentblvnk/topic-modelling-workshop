Extreme Death / Black metal from Florida.

``Bulldozer Of Semitic Destruction`` was recorded and produced in a very well-known metal recording studio. When the studio's producer learned of the NS lyrics on, he was horrified that his name would be associated with NSBM, and thusly refused to continue with the project. The recordings were finished in another studio while legal negotiations took place resulting in the label agreeing not to disclose the studio or producer. (Notice, the band is from Florida.)
