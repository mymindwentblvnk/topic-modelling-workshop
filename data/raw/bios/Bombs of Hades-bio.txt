BOMBS OF HADES was formed in 2002 in Västerås, Sweden  just to to have some fun while drinking in the rehearsal studio. At first it had 5 members and the music was some sort of Crust Punk. But after a while only 3 members were left and the music had transformed into some kind of old school death metal ala 1985-1990. After being sort of a side band for years, and the line-up changing from time to time, the band has now transformed into a fulltime band (with Ekman, Söderback and Forsberg still playing in THE RULING CLASS though and Stålhammar has other projects going). As former members of ABHOTH (Ekman & Stålhammar), MACABRE END/GOD MACABRE/UTUMNO (Stålhammar) and TRIBULATION/DISSOBER (Forsberg) they are certanly no newcomers when it comes to Old School Death Metal!! STAY BRUTAL!!
