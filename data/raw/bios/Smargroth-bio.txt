The leader and the founder Smargroth, from whom the band got its name, has dwelled in the musical spheres for many eons until he founded black metal as a superior genre. He started Smargroth in 2006 and soon recruited new experienced members Kos, Vraan, Ulverbite and Oybl. In the fall of 2009 band published their first album "The Arrival of Necrotronian", limited to just 200 copies.

Two years later, new album, named Empyreal Cycle, that was forged for 6 months in dark secrecy, is promising to change your days into inferno.
