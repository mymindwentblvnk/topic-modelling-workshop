From Brazil, Maestrick is a progressive rock group formed in 2004 with 2 LP releases and 2 EP releases since 2010. From covers on The Trick Side Of Some Songs which was a medley of different classic progressive songs through time, to their first LP Unpuzzle, the band continues to release new music. The most recent album, acclaimed from many progressive fans alike Espresso Della Vita: Solare was mostly based on the comparison of life to a train ride. Choo choo! 

The album is expected to have a direct sequel, Espresso Della Vita: Lunare within early to the middle of 2019. Fans of the band are setting high expectations, and due to the previous nature of the band they are not expected to disappoint. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Maestrick">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
