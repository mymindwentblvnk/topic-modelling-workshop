Eradikator are a 5 Piece Thrash Metal Band from Birmingham UK. The birthplace of heavy metal bands such as Black Sabbath, Napalm Death and Judas Priest. Drawing on all their life and musical influences, Eradikator set out to create Thrash metal that would make even the most hardened metal heads ears hemorrhage liquid steel. Eradikator are commited to the ideal of living in mediocrity to bring heavy music to the masses and living life as one big party with a single goal of being able to tour for the rest of their lives. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Eradikator">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
