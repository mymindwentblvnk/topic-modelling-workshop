There are 4 groups the use the name Excel:

1) Maybe there is life in Venice, CA, that doesn't involve the beach; iron pumpers and Suicidal Tendencies, since that's all you seem to hear about. Yes? Of course, there is always EXCEL! Their demos were major impression sessions and now with the release of their first album "Split Image", the direction of EXCEL is officially exposed. Combining a rabble-rousing attack of metal with deep hardcore roots, the outcome is thick and heavy with sudden excursions into the rapids. Paced by ample guitar chunka chunka's axe man Adam Siegel works the frets on compositions that are interesting yet not overly original. Dan Clements' talk-singing type of vocal projection fits well with the EXCEL approach, and comes in at the right places. EXCEL is definitely brick material, hard and sturdy. Not suffering from snare core, they advance with sonic power and creep forth with an awesome fatness.

2) Excel is an ambient/drone collaboration of James Ferraro (the Skaters) and LaBanna Bly (P.A.R.A.)

3) There was also a power-pop band called Excel, their song "Rock Show" has appeared on a couple of compilations of obscure power-pop.
