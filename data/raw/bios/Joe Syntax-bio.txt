Prodigious new talent and recent Med School signing, Joe Syntax is a 24 year old drum & bass DJ and producer. Originally from Norwich and now residing in South London, Joe has carved out a niche for himself, focusing on experimental D+B with a discernable dancefloor edge. He started producing in 2007 and has since gone on to release on a number of labels including Hospital, Med School, Allsorts, Blu Saphir and Grid Recordings. In this time, he has also garnered the respect of some of the scene’s pioneers with Fabio, Hype and London Elektricity amongst his legion of supporters.

Joe’s artist name derives from the idea of his music as his own personal language with its own arrangement and unique structure, so it’s unsurprising that his music varies from experimental half-time compositions through to all out dance-floor rollers. Joe cites electronica, breakbeat, techno and downtempo as key influences and name checks Ninja Tune’s Coldcut, Hexstatic, Luke Vibert, Leftfield and Carl Cox amongst his most inspirational artists.

As a DJ, Joe is renowned for his creativity, often mixing his own material with work from up-and-coming producers and he now has a DJ schedule which is taking him around the world. His stand out set at fabric in January 2011 was a far cry from his attempts to mix his dad’s old dub records with some hip hop tunes on a set of Sherwood belt drives aged 16. Having been listed as one of K Mag’s ‘Top 10 Producers To Watch In 2011’ and armed with a plethora of hot Med School dubs, one thing’s for sure – all eyes will be firmly fixed on Joe Syntax as we look to the future. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Joe+Syntax">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
