Dance-art-damage! D.C.'s Measles Mumps Rubella play a hard brand of dance-punk that draws comparisons to an edgier !!! or a modern-day A Certain Ratio. Since their debut 45 release in 2002 (recorded by Dischord heavyweights Ian Mackaye and Don Zientara), people have been talking a whole lot about this band.

Slinky bass lines and spiky guitars permeate MMR's sound, along with persistent, multi-percussionist beats and aggressive, distorted shouts. It takes the band awhile to find the groove, as some of their songs top the 10-minute mark, but when they finally grab hold of it they never want to let it go.

MMR just released their debut EP to great fanfare on the "too cool for school" Troubleman Unlimited label and already have a full-length album in the works. It appears they are just getting the party started. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Measles+Mumps+Rubella">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
