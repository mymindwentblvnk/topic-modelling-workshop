The Story of UnleasHer until today 

UnleasHer was formed in autumn of 2001 when 3 friends decided to start jamming for fun. Tuomo had been playing the guitar for 5 years and Petri had some experience with the bass, so it was a good basis to go on with, even though Hemmi was a "rookie". Luckily Tuomo had drums - so it was easy for Hemmi to start experimenting with drums because no big investments were needed. 

In the beginning, the band played Kotiteollisuus covers, but quite soon the band composed their own songs too. If you listen to their songs, you could hear influences also from bands like Dimmu Borgir, The Kovenant etc... quite atmospheric stuff in general. 

UnleasHer's first public performance was in the summer of 2003, at 'Huiluuruppeemat' summer festival at Maaninka. The band was known as "Messenger" as those days. 

In July 2004, UnleasHer recorded 3 songs with the assistance of Tommi Liukkonen (Sethery). 2 of these songs were released in form of the 'Brain Terror' -demo, in November 2004.
