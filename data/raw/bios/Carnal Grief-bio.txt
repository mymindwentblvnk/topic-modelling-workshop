Carnal Grief, originating from Arboga, Sweden. Formed in 1997 with the aim to play Melodic Death Metal but have since then shifted its aim although the Melodic Death Metal vibe is still present in the sound of the band, most obviously by the way Jonas sings. One could say that Melodic Death is the foundation and that they've added elements of Heavy Metal and Hardcore to the formula.
