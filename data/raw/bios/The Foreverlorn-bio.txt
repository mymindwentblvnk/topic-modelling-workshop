The band was founded in a small town near Munich, Germany in 1993 by current member Haris Durakovic. The first and only Demo yet saw the light of the day in 1996.
Mainly influenced by Gothic/Death/Doom Metal bands at that time, such as Anathema, Cathedral and others, the demo featured five tracks and was the first and last official recording so far.

Today, the band transformed into a one-man-project by Haris Durakovic (kARHu, The Intimate Room, Misanthrop), busily collecting relevant material to be recorded. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Foreverlorn">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
