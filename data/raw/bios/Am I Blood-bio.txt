Thrash-Metal band from Helsinki (Finland) formed in 1992 and formerly known as St. Mucus. 
They released a record as St. Mucus in 1995, which is called "Natural Mutation". With their actual name, Am I Blood has released 4 records and an EP so far, including: "Am I Blood" (1997), "Agitation" (1998), "Gone With You (EP)" (2000), "The Truth Inside the Dying Sun" (2001), "The Truth Inside The Dying Sun" re-edition (2005) and "Existence of Trauma" (2011). 
The "The Truth Inside The Dying Sun" record was ready to be released a couple of years before 2005, but the band decided to wait due to some trouble with an American label. Eventually the album was released with the Finnish label Scandinavian A1 Music. 

Jenne Kerminan sounds like James Hetfield especially in "Gone With You" (MetallicA).
