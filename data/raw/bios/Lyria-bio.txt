Lyria is a Symphonic Alternative Metal band idealized and founded by the singer and songwriter Aline Happ in 2012 in  Rio de Janeiro, Brazil .

The name Lyria was inspired by the Greek Mythology and the lyre that was an important musical instrument for the Greeks. It is also related to the flower lily and to the word lyrics.

In the end of 2012, Lyria presented its first song called Reflection inspired by the Narcissus Myth. 
The song was really well received especially in Europe and in The United States. 

In 2013, Eliezer Andre (drums) and  Thiago Zig (bass) joined Lyria as official members. 

In 2014, the band decided to take a break from concerts and focused on its first album - Catharsis - that 
was produced through a successful crowdfunding campaign where fans from different parts of the world got really engaged with the cause.
