Whenyoung is an Irish trio based in Dublin. The trio comprises Aoife Power (Vocals/Bass), Niall Burns (Guitar), Andrew Flood (Drums). 

Their story started in Limerick... three underage teenagers met for the first time after sneaking into Costello's Tavern: the only bar in town that floated their musical tastes. After bonding over cheap vodka and the sound of The Velvet Underground, they began playing music togeter and moved to Dublin to seek some big city excitement. Developing their sound, still with a DIY approach, the band moved to London and last year became Whenyoung.

On stage, Whenyoung perform a dizzying rock show where Aoife's dreamy, heart-in-the-mouth vocals fizzle between swigs of Guinnss and infectious guitar riffs. Aoife's mesmerising stage presence has been compared to "Suzi Quatro in her heyday, bashing out throbbing bass lines". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/whenyoung">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
