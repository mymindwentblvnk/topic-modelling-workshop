Poets Of Thought. Real Name: Paul Hunter. Aliases: Brother Of Soul, Dual Tone, Paul Hunter, Red Hook Project, Second Crusade, Small World

Recording for the Cookin' offshoot of LTJ Bukem's Looking Good/Good Looking Records, Poets of Thought (actually just one man, Paul Hunter) brought the sound of jazzy hip-hop to the British drum'n'bass scene, with recordings mostly free of breakbeats at all. Given a chance to shine on Bukem's late-1996 compilation Earth, Vol. 1, Hunter responded with two diverse tracks, one a piece of blunted hip-hop and another a surprisingly accurate interpretation of '60s Latin-tinged soul-jazz. - John Bush, All Music Guide  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Poets+of+Thought">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
