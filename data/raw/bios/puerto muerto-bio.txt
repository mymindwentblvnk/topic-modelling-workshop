Puerto Muerto was supposed to be a bar. You know, the kind of place the lowest forms of humanity could meet, drink and occasionally engage in revelry. Tim and Christa decided it was much easier to start a band than open up a tavern. So instead of serving clients liquor and beer, they decided to intoxicate those same folks with the songs that they had envisioned them singing there. Tim Kelley (vocals/ guitar) brings a hefty dose of The Clash, Stiff Little Fingers, The Pogues, The Kinks and Buddy Holly to the table, while Christa Meyer, inspired by Nina Simone, Kurt Weill, Nick Cave and anything dusty and neglected, sashays her mezzo soprano front and center. Their debut release "Your Bloated Corpse Has Washed Ashore" (2001) is now a cult classic and the band band continues to surprise and enthrall critics and audiences alike with their ingenuity and inventiveness. In 2005 the pair released a supplemental soundtrack to the original slasher film The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and toured performing live with the film in the US and UK. Their 2008 release "I Was A Swallow" won critical praise by showing the duo's more intimate and subtle qualities. Currently the band is working on their next album; a bombastic, revolutionary affair that will cause the patrons of the fictitious bar Puerto Muerto to flood the streets and wreak havoc. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Puerto+Muerto">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
