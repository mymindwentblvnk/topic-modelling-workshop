Repulsion may refer to two different bands: 

1. Repulsion are a legendary band hailed as being one of the biggest influences on the grindcore genre, despite only releasing one official full length album entitled "Horrified" in 1989 (recorded in 1986).

The band formed in 1984 under the name Genocide, releasing three demos with this name.  Later, they changed the name to the more "fitting name" for their style of music and lyrical content, which is Repulsion.  With the name Repulsion, they released one full length album, two demos and a single.  They broke up around 1991 and after over a decade, the band decided to reform again circa 2004.

Repulsion hold a legendary status as a band influencing countless earlier grindcore bands like Napalm Death, Carcass and Terrorizer.  The band is also hailed as one of the first breeds of grindcore being mixed with death metal, influencing the goregrind genre heavily.

2. Repulsion was the original name of the legendary gothic/doom metal band Type O Negative. They released their demo album None More Negative during this time. Soon after they changed their name due to the above grindcore band already having the name. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Repulsion">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
