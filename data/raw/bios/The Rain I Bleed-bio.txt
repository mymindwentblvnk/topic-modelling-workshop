The Rain I Bleed is a melodic metal band from Greece formed in 2008. The project started from Mina (the singer) who is responsible for The Rain I Bleed's music and lyrics. Their debut album "Narcissist" was released in the summer of 2011, produced by Chris "Rektor" Ntaskas, mixed by Jonas Kjellgren from Scar Symmetry at Black Lounge Studio (Sweden) and mastered by Kevin Reeves at the Universal Studios (USA). In the special credits of the album is also included Jeff Loomis from Nevermore one of the world's top guitar players as a guest with a guitar solo, Jonas Kjellgren a very skilled musicia from Scar Symmetry as a guest with a guitar solo, the Swedish designer Niklas Sundin from Dark Tranquility who designed the album's cover and the talented Gogo Melone from Luna Obscura who designed the album's booklet. The Rain I Bleed was also the support act for the Dutch band Epica in their shows in Greece, a very important and successful moment when the band created a good fanbase in their homeland and took some really encouraging reviews from the press.
