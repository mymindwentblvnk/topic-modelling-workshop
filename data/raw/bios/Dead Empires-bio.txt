Dead Empires is a three-piece heavy instrumental progressive metal band from the Hudson Valley, NY. 

While the band is instrumental, they choose not to label themselves as such- the sound is ever-evolving, and they’d prefer to put out music that is organic, natural, passionate- rather than stick to a particular genre. The band likes to combine a wide range of influences to produce a sound that sways from epic, ethereal soundscapes to heavy post-rock riffs, rounded out with good old fashioned sludgy heaviness.

Their new recently-completed new album "Waiting In Waves" was released November 6th 2012, and comes hot off the heels of their critically acclaimed MONUMENTS EP. The album was produced, recorded, and mastered by D. James Goodwin (Devo, Murder by Death, Thursday, Kaki King, Norah Jones) at The IkOsOn Studios in Woodstock, NY and features art by Revolution Dream Design (revolutiondream.com). The album will be available on 12" colored vinyl or digital download. PRE-ORDER “WAITING IN WAVES” NOW at deadempires.com.

The album was funded in part thanks to a successful kickstarter campaign, allowing for the vinyl deluxe edition to be produced. Your help was kindly appreciated! 

The band’s original EP “MONUMENTS” was recorded by Will Riggs at Bigg Rigg Studios (myspace.com/biggriggstudios) and mastered by Bumblefoot (of Guns N' Roses, bumblefoot.com). It is available as a free digital download or on deluxe limited-edition CD, hand-numbered and assembled by the band with exclusive art as well as a bonus track.

Both MONUMENTS and the SUMMER 2011 DEMO will be made available for free digitally to anyone who purchased a Vinyl copy of WAITING IN WAVES or a CD copy of MONUMENTS, while supplies last (please contact deadempiresmusic@gmail.com for more information).

Some reviews of WAITING IN WAVES:

“8/10! Memorable, entertaining, intricate and compelling...get your head out of whatever you’re rotting by and check out this band!”
-Kevin Stewart-Panko, Decibel Magazine (Nov 2012, Issue 97)

“4/5! If you haven't given this hard-hitting ensemble a chance yet, your time would be well spent getting acquainted with them. ...Dead Empires is an instrumental endeavor, fluctuating between sledgehammer riffs and moments of light repose. One minute, an energetic groove grabs you by the collar, banging your head back and forth vigorously, and the next you're smoothly reclined into a comfortable jazzy interlude. ...Waiting In Waves is a fantastic first full length by a band who is striving to earn an audience.”
-Barry Adkins, Better B# Music Blog (http://betterbsharp.weebly.com/)

"4/5! Waiting in Waves shows a confidence in song-writing that makes it seem like the band perfected their sound two or three albums ago, with a creativity that indicates they’ll be keeping it up for many more."

Some reviews of MONUMENTS:

“5/5! The skill here makes each track seem layered, genuine and intense. Each song is simple and complex in its own right… The style that Dead empires delivers is so intense you can’t help being sucked in… It’s a great release and its weighted and genuine. I see big things coming for these three dudes from Poughkeepsie NY. So remember the name Dead Empires.” 
-Collin Trabacco, stereokiller.com

“8/10! It is pure heavy music devoid of any cliche’s usually associated with post-rock, sludge-metal, doom-metal acts. The dexterity the musicians in the band display over the course of the 4 tracks is exciting without being too complex or pompous. There is also a strong emphasis on great songwriting and memorable musical passages that gets stuck in your head instantly. This is a great demo from a band that for once doesn’t really have the usual trademarks of any genre except it kicks ass.”
-Doommantia.com

“Monuments is a solid, up-tempo slab of progressive, sludgy instrumental post-metal, guaranteed to kick you in the face. …their video for “hello” to oblivion should hopefully convince you that this is worth your time.” 
-GroverXIII, thenumberoftheblog.com

“It sounds like a fan of sludge metal got together with a fan of thrash metal, added a prog metal dude, and then, with no one dominating their influences, combined powers equally like some awesome metal version of Captain Planet. …really heavy and genuinely intense.” 
-theluxuryyachtreview.com

"a heavy, familiar, but strangely unique band of instrumental metal. (Warning: May contain toxic soundgasms, keep away from children!)"
...The combined assault of the guitar and bass with absolutely angry drum parts makes for a psychedelic sonic spectacle of vicious riff-based music. If you dig any sort of instrumental metal or post rock, I suggest you keep these guys on your radar." - Misha, The Burn Space Blog

“New York’s Dead Empires bridge the gap between hardcore riffery and moments of thoughtful repose. The trio’s debut, Monuments, is an ambitious four-song EP. With rapid-fire riffs and exquisitely buzzing bass lines… the group go to great lengths to provide a set of instrumentals which won’t disappoint.” 
-Barry Adkins

"Monuments is intriguing. The band manages to pack quite an array of metal into the four songs and twenty minutes: one can hear sludge metal, bits of progressive metal, and bursts of thrash metal. The EP is certainly going to get attention from a diverse group of music fans, especially because Dead Empires executes each style well without being gimmicky or inaccessible—and without the help of a vocalist."
