Wedingoth is a musical project based on openness, the mixture of styles, whose credo is claimed eclecticism. It combines the power of rock served by a female voice charged with emotion, nuances inviting air travel backed by an orchestral technique.

Summer 2009, the group entered the studio to record their first album of 13 tracks: Candlelight. This is a concept album based on a reflection on the future of mankind in the disturbing context of land degradation. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wedingoth">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
