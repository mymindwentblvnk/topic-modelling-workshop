There are 5 artists called Endorphine: On the main picture you may see the japanese one.

1) Japanese rock/visual kei band (VO: Yukari (ex-Baiser) GU: Mizuki (ex-Baiser), BA: Shion (ex-JE*REVIENS), DR: Yoshiki), disbanded after three releases in 2001.

2) Thai Band:
Things got started back in junior high when friends Bomb (drums) and Kia (guitar) decided to form a band and asked Bomb’s brother Bird (bass) to join in.

But with only drums and guitars, it wasn’t much of a band — at least not one that could compete in any of the band competitions that make or break wannabe stars. They needed a lead vocalist, and that’s when Da came in.

Impressed with Da’s unique and powerful voice, the band asked her to join. “Since we played rock music, we never thought our lead singer would be a girl,” Bomb said. “But when we heard Da sing, we knew she was the missing piece.”

They were almost set, but there was still one other thing they needed — the right name.

Stuck in traffic one day, Bomb spotted a bumper sticker that had the word “endorphine” written on it [Student Weekly and most dictionaries spell the word as “endorphin”]. Curious, Bomb looked the word up and found the perfect name for his band. “Endorphins are a chemical substance produced by the brain when we’re happy or in pain,” Bomb said. “And we want people to be happy listening to our songs. Hence the name Endorphine.”

3) French industrial/noise artist.

4) Polish electronic/etno band.

5) Russian Alternative/Rock band
