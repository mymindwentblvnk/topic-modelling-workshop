1. Jörg Burger is also known as The Modernist, Burger/Ink, & Bionaut. Under his Triola alias he records ambient techno and has released a full length titled: Triola in Fünftonraum with the Kompakt label. Burger's productions are usually easy to identify by their prickly keyboards and heavy tech-dub atmospheres.
