Witches of Doom are a goth-stoner-doom band born in Rome in January 2013, when Federico Venditti –guitars-, DaniloPiludu –vocals- Jacopo Cartelli-bass- Andrea Budicin-drums- got together and started their own musical project in order to play a personalised mix of 80’s goth, 70’s hard rock blended with a 90’s sensibility that harks back to Type o’Negative and Moonspell among others. 
The Roman ensemble started to write their own material and in just a few months the bulk of the debut album was already panned out. Witches of Doom want to play in front of an audience and in Spring 2013 they embark on a series of live dates within the Roman circuit where they will establish their name as one of the hottest bands in the Roman underground music scene.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Witches+of+Doom">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
