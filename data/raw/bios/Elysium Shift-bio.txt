Elysium Shift sprang to life in the summer of 1995, and have been havin' a good time ever since! Over the years the band have evolved from a young teenage grunge act to the purveyors of killer metal we know and love today. They have gigged extensively, supporting the likes of Misery Loves Co., Blaze Bayley, Kill II This and Raging Speedhorn in the past, and have also graced the stage at the Total Rock Tattoofest. 

Elysium Shifts' sound is a unique blend of old-school influences, such as Testament and Pantera, and more contempary influences such as Machine Head and Soilwork. They combine melody with searing aggression to awesome effect whilst all the time concentrating on that seemingly elusive factor, enjoying themselves! The brand new album, "Inhuman Nature" was launched on the 24th March at The Rose Theatre in Rugeley, Staffordshire, England to a sold out capacity crowd of 300 fans, old and new who wanted to both get their copy of the album and to catch the bands incendiary live show.
