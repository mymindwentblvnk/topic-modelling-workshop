Dungeon Beast began in Olympia, Washington in 2005 as a one-off demo project.  The demo featured 4 tracks and was entitled 'Skeletal Assailants.'  In the fall of 2012 original guitarist Matt Preston (of Borrowed Time, Ghost Tower and Infectonator), now stationed in Lansing, Michigan, released a new collection of 3 songs under the name Dungeon Beast, working with an otherwise new line-up from the first demo and bringing in the talents of Matt War (Harbinger, Wastelander), Sam Ceckowski (Demon Bitch) and Rael Andrews (Bert) for the collaboration. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dungeon+Beast">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
