We are Sacred Ground! We dwell in the middle of the desert near Palm Springs in a lovely cactus covered Yucca Valley. We have been a band since November of '09 with our current line up, but three of us have been in the same band years back. We all enjoy heavy metal music from greats like Metallica, Lamb of God, and Bodom, yet we all have a soft spot for more melodic and hardcore stuff too...among some are Avenged and August Burns Red. We aren't really sure what style we enjoy playing yet, we basically are a melting pot for a few genres, but we can hang with the real heavy stuff, and kick it back with some soft too. We currently have just put out a demo album which was recorded at Zombie Studios in Riverside, CA. Dustin the sound engineer there did a great job with the strict 5 hours we had to record. If you have questions or want to talk to us feel free to leave a comment on here or our myspace, and one of the band members will holla back at you!  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sacred+Ground">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
