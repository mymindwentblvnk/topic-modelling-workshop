Viable formed new years eve 2003 and experienced the true viable writing process for the first time the following summer in a good friend's sweltering 3rd storey loft.

Members consist of ex members (Brooks and Jenner) of Chatham high school band Second Fall, and 1 ex member (Fox) of London band Tubularcube. Curiously enough Hodge and Fox had been part of a failed attempt to launch a group some years earlier, but once Hodge of London met Brooxy, it was evident that the 2 guitarists shared many views and influences, as well as sense of musical style.

The music is the focus of this group. It is highly dynamic, often dissonant and rhythmically relentless. As Viable matures, it strays further from its trends of origin. Its stylistic diversity grows, enriching and confusing the listener simultaneously. This is a musical group attempting to shed its surrounding scene and look inside itself for inspiration. 

It wants you to hear that which results.
