200-2002, blurry Beginning: Slumbering without proper line-up, only TK (from Pyuria, Shadows of Sunset, Luciferase) and PB (from Necrobiosis, Fall of the Leafe, Luciferase) involved. Within that period too many persons were invited in and out, though OM (from Pyuria) and TF (from Mental Transformation) were found.

 2003, procreating: Pregnancy in the spring of 2003 gave birth for the first-born bastard, Gamashinoch. Labours for mini-cd took place in converted slaughterhouse, the maternity known as Haven Studios. First tour with Repugnant and Centinex occurred.

 2004, assignment: Moment of intimacy with Golden Lake Productions begetted the harlot named Fragments of Perdition. Birth took 20 hour with caesarean section in Pop-Studio. Outcome led to another tour, this time with Insision, Godhate and Hateform

 2005-XXXX, healthcare: Gamashinoch got clonic manipulation by Hammermill Records. Medical Inspection disclosed the enigma in vocal cords, TS mended the annoyance. Dysrythmia was solved by castrating  TF out and integrating TL (from Torture Killer, Deepred, Demigod) in, as a new pulse apparatus. Moments granted OM to abandon the situation and concentrate on his own matters.  LS (from Funeral Feast) grinded in to balance the consensus. Degeneration still prolonged, to cease the spoiling TS got replaced by JK (from Autere).

 Theme: hate, anguish and egoism that serves as a satire towards the larvae known as humanity. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Death+Du+Jour">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
