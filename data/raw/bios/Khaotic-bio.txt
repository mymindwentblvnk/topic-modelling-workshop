Created in june 2012 by D. Profaner, Khaotic is not only a project, but a very personal art in music form, it was created to express deep feelings and thoughts about the obscure, the human weakness and total hatred and repudiation to christianity. Khaotic came to praise the true darkness, unmask the lies, to defy those who are submissive to the farce, to fight against alienation, to desecrate the word of god. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Khaotic">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
