Týr is a folk metal band from the Faroe Islands. Their music can be described as a blend of viking, folk and significant progressive structures. The band incorporates many folk elements and melodies in their songs, spiced up by the musical inclusion of the islands' native folk structure. Their songs include many rhythm changes and complex time signatures.

The project began in January 1998. Heri Joensen met his old bandmate, Kári Streymoy, at a party in Copenhagen, Denmark. Joensen suggested to Streymoy that they should meet up and jam. Streymoy initially declined, but later took him up on his offer.

They were soon joined by another former bandmate, bassplayer Gunnar H. Thomsen, making the duo a trio.

Singer Pól Arni Holm and guitarist Jón Joensen (Heri Joensen's brother) were part of the band while they recorded How Far to Asgaard but left soon after its release.

Terji Skibenæs joined after Jón Joensen had left the band. Allan Streymoy (Kári Streymoy's brother) took over singing duties for a brief time during which they released the single "Ólavur Riddararós". After Allan left Heri Joensen took over the vocals. It was this line up which recorded Eric the Red.

Skibenæs left the band for a while after the release of Eric the Red. The band played as a trio for some time. In the summer of 2004 they were joined by Icelandic guitarist Ottó P. Arnarson for a very brief time. When the latter left, Skibenæs came back. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/T%C3%BDr">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
