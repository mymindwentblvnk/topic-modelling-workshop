'Purvaja' is a one man Vedic/Black metal act from Hyderabad formed in the October of 2011. Purvaja is the solo project of Rahul Das who handles all guitars/ vocals/ drum-sampling/ lyrics and even the artwork. His previous solo DSBM project 'Cry' was closed few months back due to personal reasons.

With various influences from genres like Norwegian black metal and Vedic metal, Purvaja tries to combine the elements required to reflect on its lyrical themes based on Vedic culture, Hindu Philosophy, Mythology and other related theologies.
