St. Paul, Minnesota, USA (2010 - Present

Chaos Frame is a Power/Progressive Metal band from Minnesota, USA.

Bringing St. Paul the finest in regressive metal since 2010. 

Chaos Frame will never: feature lengthy wank solos, rhyme 'fire' with 'desire,' BREAK IT DOWN BRO, give you up, let you down, write pointless intro tracks, front-load all the good songs 

Chaos Frame WILL: bring the riffs, change keys a lot, change time signatures a lot, add blastbeats to things, have epic parts, experiment a bit, release material when it's good and ready <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Chaos+Frame">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
