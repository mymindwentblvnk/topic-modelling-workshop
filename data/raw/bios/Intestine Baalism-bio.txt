Intestine Baalism is a Japanese death metal band that was formed in Tokyo 1991 by Seiji Kakuzaki (Vocals / Guitars), Takeshi Ohkouchi (Drums) and other unknown local musicians as a thrash metal band. After Katsumasa Yoshida joined on bass in 1992, they switched to playing death metal. Intestine Baalism fuses traditional brutal death metal with melodic death metal in direct, often surprising juxtaposition. After the release of one demo, the label Repulse Records signed the band and released their debut album, An Anatomy of the Beast. Due to several unexpected troubles, the band was put on a hold for a long while. Two remaining members, Seiji and Katsumasa, continued to write music while they were seeking full-time members who were able to dedicate themselves by 100% to the band. In 2000, these were found and the second album was recorded. Banquet in the Darkness was not released until 2003 by Blackend Records. In 2004, Intestine Baalism started working on a third album, titled Ultimate Instinct, which was released in 2008.
