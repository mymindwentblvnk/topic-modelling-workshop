There are multiple artists named Koresh:

1) Koresh are four drunken idiots from London. When they can be bothered to put down the cans and pick up instruments they play a vicious mixture of nasty doom riffs with ADHD tempos. Imagine someone playing Eyehategod but really fast so they go to the pub quicker.

More recently Koresh have taken on two new members: Ritch (guitar and hair) and Donny (vocals), who have both proven themselves as drunkards: Donny cutting his teeth with ex-tourmates Among The Missing.

As of late April 2010, Koresh have achieved the unspeakable and have actually managed to record their debut album 'Crippledriver', which is released Withered Hand Records.http://www.witheredhandrecords.com.

2) Koresh was a punk band from Wilmington, NC, formed by members of Anarchist Task Force.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Koresh">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
