Saux is a creative Amsterdam-based producer and multi-instrumentalist. He uses real instruments, old samples and an eclectic mix of contemporary music to create new tracks everyday. At the age of 11 he got his first keyboard, which changed him from being passionate about music into a passionate musician. Saux draws his inspiration from jazz, funk, and soul as well as from present-day beats and future soul and funk.
