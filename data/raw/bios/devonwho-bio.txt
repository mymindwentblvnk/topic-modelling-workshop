One of the Klipmode family - whose membership includes Suzi Analogue, mndsgn and Knxwledge - the LA via Portland-based producer, devonwho, makes awesome, synthy, low-slung beats that sit somewhere in between hip hop and experimental electronic music - if you're up on Beat Dimensions or the Beatnicks 12"s you'll know the vibe. Various members of Klipmode have done a series of EP releases entitled 3P (which can be yours for less than Â£5 - seek them out), and devonwho's is out today - free of charge too if you are willing to give up your email address.  Get on this early, click the link below to get a hold of it.
