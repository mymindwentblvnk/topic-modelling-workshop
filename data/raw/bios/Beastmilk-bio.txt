BEASTMILK MANIFESTO
i would not drink milk and nor would i have my children's blood paying for both sides of the war with my milk (let's just get some more foreign oil). and how do you feel about the menstrual cycle. the blood: you can not continue to drink my breastmilk: the average menstrual cycle is twenty-eight days. drink it! how much money causes ovulation; a gushing geyser of oil? (mmm, warm!) contaminated blood products imported from the U.S. in the 1970's and the 1980's: quite content with just sitting here watching television pumping away: and menstruation does not occur. children are SICK! milk is linked to kidney stone fake-milk and toothpaste, to tainted liquor. It's contaminated: I don't want the machine to be taking over.

In March 2015 Beastmilk parted ways with guitarist and co-founding member Johan "Goatspeed" Snell and changed the band's name to Grave Pleasures. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Beastmilk">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
