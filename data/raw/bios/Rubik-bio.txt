Rubik is a name of at least two acts:

1) A Finnish indie quartet
2) A London based producer/songwriter

1) Rarely has an indie rock band created such fuss all over the Finnish music scene as Rubik.  Formed in 2002 an already sold-out mini-album up their sleeve, the band released their debut LP "Bad Conscience Patrol" to much anticipation in March 2007.  The album instantly acclaimed critical praise with comparisons to works of Radiohead, Sigur Ros and dEUS.  Their "Bad Conscience Patrol" debuted 7th in the Official Finnish Charts. It also gave them their first hit with the single "City & the Streets"

In 2007 Rubik toured Finland, UK and Germany, performing at distinguished festivals such as Hultsfred, South by Southwest, Transmission and Eurosonic. The band has shared stages with acts such as Mogwai, Autechre, Apostle of Hustle and Disco Ensemble.
