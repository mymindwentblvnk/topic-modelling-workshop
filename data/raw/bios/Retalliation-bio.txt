Retalliation were a death/thrash metal band which released only one demo, titled Death from the Inside in 1995. They were a prison band, their demo was recorded in jail via a prison musical development center. Fortunately the tape was released before the warden was aware of its content. After learning of the albums violent lyrics, they were banned from the program. Thus preventing a second release.

Their charges incase you're curious:

Rick Desroisier  (vocals): 2nd Degree Murder
Sebran "Mike" Shagoury (bass): 2nd Degree Murder
P.J. Fredricks (guitar): Armed Robbery (out on parole)
Gerald Fitzpatrick (drums): Armed Robbery (out on parole) <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Retalliation">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
