Deaf Wish began in a soggy West Melbourne rehearsal room in May 2007, standing around screaming and bashing through songs with one solid philosophy: ‘go to feedback’ when things fall apart.  After a handful of rehearsals, they recorded 10 songs and played 2 shows.  Then guitar player Sarah Hardiman flew to the UK and never came back.
     Deaf Wish stopped for a year whilst the album was passed around and grew a cult following stemming from punks and spreading around the pubs and yards of Melbourne.  Deaf Wish reformed with a new member in June 2008, performing as a ramshackle unit of four suburban no-hopers, bleeding through feedback, noise and emotional abandon.
     They were picked up by local label Stained Circles (Dirt Bombs, Jay Reatard, Clockcleaner, Stabs, Pink Reason, etc) and toured around Australia.
     While they are often compared to US bands like the Wipers, Husker Du and Red Kross; Australian bands such as X and Venom P Stinger; it is an unarguably and distinctly Melbourne suburban sound that Deaf Wish have made their own.
