Opus Nocturnales is a Flemisch Black Metal band and was formed in 1997 in Deurne-zuid, Antwerp. After breaking up in 2001, the band was reformed again in 2005 by original members Corvus Nocurnales (vocals) & bassist Lord Kur/Sekiaku and former guitarist Skald MorphiuS (who was  in the band since 1998 or 1999 untill the breakup in 2001).
