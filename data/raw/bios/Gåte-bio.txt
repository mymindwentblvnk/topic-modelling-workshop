Gåte (Norwegian for riddle or mystery) was a band that formed in Trondheim, Norway in 1999. They played Norwegian folk and folk inspired music, blended with heavy rock and electronica, sometimes called progressive folk-rock.

While some songs are original, many come from traditional Norwegian folk songs. Some songs are based on the poems of the Norwegian poet Astrid Krogh Halse. These include "Følgje" ("Companion") and "Stengd Dør ("Closed Door"). The music consists of guitaring, violins, synthesized keyboarding, drumming, and the distinctive voice of Gunnhild Sundli.

On September 6th, 2005, the band announced that they would "take a break" to pursue other stuff, mostly because of Gunnhild's desire to do something else. This came as a surprise to many, as the band has been a success both in Norway and abroad, especially in Germany. However, they released a new album in 2006, Liva, a live recording from Rockefeller, Oslo.

Gåte returned for a one-time performance during the culture festival UKA in Trondheim, on October 24, 2009. After the success with this concert, they announced they would tour festivals in Norway in the summer of 2010. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/G%C3%A5te">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
