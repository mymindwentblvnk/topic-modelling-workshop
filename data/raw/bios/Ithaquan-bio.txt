Ithaquan is a metal band hailing from Kokkola, Finland.

The band started in summer ‘07 by Kaapro and Ville.

Their music can be considered as progressive metal, though its very eclectic with influences ranging from jazz, blues, progressive rock, ambient etc. Their first demo ‘The Torn Nemesia’ was to be out in the spring of ‘09 but it was tossed away because of the sound quality. They are now re-recording 'Qualm' for a single release. Their first ep will be recorded during the summer and it will contain three new songs and maybe some bonus tracks.
