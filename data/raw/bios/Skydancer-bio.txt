In the last six years Skydancer has been growing step by step to made itself a shining name into the immense mass of Heavy Metal bands. Founded by Daniel Soengas, in the seaside town of Vigo, the northwestern Spain, they defined an unique style. Extremely rough vocals, melodic patterns and skillful guitar solos had been their trademarks since the first album ¨Pozo de Lágrimas¨ (2008). The vocal tone, and a intense dark atmosphere, made it an absolutely different experience among the metal releases of the year. (¨A breath of fresh air for the Spanish metal scene.¨ Kerrang!)

Second album, ¨Endorsed by Self-Destruction¨ (2009). Produced this time by Daniel Soengas, main composer of the band. Lyrics turned to English. This work was more mature, and even faster and sharp than their debut, getting great reviews on the most important metal magazines (¨The evolution of this band it´s simply unbelievable¨ - Metal Hammer )

Only a year later, the third work of Skydancer was ready to strike. ¨Way of Departed¨ (2010), an EP with a more technical vibe but with their personality absolutely untouched. This work became a breakthrough for the band, not only because of the growing complexity of the songs. This free-download EP, worked as magic, reaching worldwide with an great feedback. For first time the band seriously gigged around his country headlining their own shows and even reaching some others abroad.

This seemed the perfect moment to capture the power of live magic, so in November of the same year, one of their performances was recorded. ¨Underground Alive¨ (2011) shows the band playing the set-list of the tour with no tricks, like any night, at any place...

In 2012, their 3rd album is released: ¨Winterkiller¨. A brand new metal masterpiece resuming the best of their carreer. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Skydancer">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
