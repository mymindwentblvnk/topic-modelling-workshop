THE PLAGUE'S AFTERMATH from Paderborn are definately anything but forgettable. With their very own brand of modern technical metal they already blasted stages all over Germany, showcasing their unique approach to songwriting and musical skills.

Formed in 2006 under a different name, the band quickly evolved into what it is today, a full-on progressive metal assault consisting of Adrian Gucze, Rafael Felix, Lukas Seiffert, Malte Beckmann and Moritz Klein. First and foremost, they are determined to stand apart from the pack of today's generic modern metal, creating music that is as worthwile as it is aggressive.

Bringing on an absolutely relentless live show, THE PLAGUE'S AFTERMATH are certainly turning some heads. From the savage guitar licks to the brutal and polyrhythmic groove parts there is nothing left to be desired.

2010 sees the release of their "Memento"-Demo, a pretaste of what's to be expected on the band's first full-length CD.
