Five old men from Chicago that remember to keep it short and sweet. Intense, Exodus-precise riffs with SOD-would-be-proud mosh parts. Seven songs in 14 minutes, one-sided LP with a silk-screened B-side, hand-screened covers and a set of baseball card inserts. 45 RPM for maximum crush. Don't let the ''thrash'' part fool you; this isn't wannabe 80's throwback nonsense. No solos, no denim jackets, no Reebok's, no shit. Ex-members of a ton of bands you've never heard of, but are awesome: HE WHO CORRUPTS, AUTHORITY ABUSE, OFF YOURSELF, THE BLONDE ALIBI, THE LETTERBOMBS & dozens more.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Chicago+Thrash+Ensemble">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
