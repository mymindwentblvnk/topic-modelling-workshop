Shaheen Jafargholi (born 23 January 1997) is a Welsh teen actor and singer from Swansea, Wales. He is of Iranian and Welsh descent. He appeared on ITV's Britain's Got Talent show and sang "Who's Lovin' You" at Michael Jackson's globally televised public memorial service in July 2009. In May 2010, Jafargholi signed a record deal with Island Records, with his debut album "When I Come of Age" due for release in 2011, along with his debut double A side single "Last Train Home/Hip Teens". However, neither were released, and Shaheen was quietly dropped by the label.

In December 2014, he is releasing an EP, Acoustic, before releasing new music in 2015. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Shaheen">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
