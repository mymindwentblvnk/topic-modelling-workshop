Keith McKnight - KMC doesn't recieve half the kudos he deserves. The lad who's Glasgow (Scotland) based, was around 1992/93 the only DJ in Scotland to go down the Drum and Bass path. Scotland at the time was wrapped up in Euro Gabber/Happy Hardcore scenes but he stuck to his guns and put on a few D&B events in Edinburgh named "Jungle Book" for which LTJ Bukem was one of the guest DJs (his first gig in Scotland), and possibly where the collaberations started. 
He was also the owner of Drastic Plastic Records just off the Royal Mile in Edinburgh. 

He is starting his own label "MicroDeepBeats" in 2009 focusing on deep, experimental drum & bass. 
Can be contacted through his "System Comms" business website.
