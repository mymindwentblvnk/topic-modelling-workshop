Philosopher (Lovecraftian Death Metal)

Philosopher … a person who seeks to understand and 
explain the nature of things around them. A person 
devoted to studying and producing results in
philosophy. The word, "philosopher," literally means
"lover of wisdom."

PHILOSOPHER from Chemnitz / Germany were formed in Winter 2002
in order to deliver technical, yet accessible “Odschool” Death
Metal. Influenced by such classical heroes of the genre such
as Morbid Angel and Death, the band wasted little time to 
join live action soon after the first songs were written.

In 2004 the band signed with RUPTURED SILENCE Rec. and produced
their first album "Thoughts" at Worldsend Studio with Sound-Wiz
Mario Dahmen (who worked for Roadrunner and Locomotive Music 
and bands like The Anti Doctrine, 10-Fold-B-Low and many others.)

PHILOSOPHER are currently gigging to promote their current
output, which gained a storm of positive reactions from
the local metal underground. Although their relatively 
short period of existence the band became quickly recognized
for their unique brand of versatile, “thought-out”, yet 
catchy Death Metal and powerful life-performances. Their strong
musical relation to famous american writer H.P.Lovecraft made
them soon well-known not only to Death Metal Fans.

Due to massively self-promoting their Demo and Album 
PHILOSOPHER gigged with bands such as Finntroll (Fin), 
Amoral (Fin), Naglfar (Swe), Fleshless (CZ), Debauchery, 
Soul Demise, Death Reality and many, many others.

In 2006 the band released their next Output "Laws ov Form" EP.

Although strongly related to their Oldschool-Influences 
and “Elder Things” in general, PHILOSOPHER never live in 
the past, but look forward on the next steps toward their
future goals.
