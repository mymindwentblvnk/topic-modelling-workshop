In early 2011 five guys, united by their love of beer, games, and rocking tunes, joined forces to create a musical Frankenstein. They sewed together searing guitar lines with belting bluesy vocals and brought it to life with rock ‘n roll groove.

In only a few months they had won two battle of the bands, toured the Eastern Cape and Gauteng and recorded their first EP, ‘IDKFA.’

In July, 2012, while in the grip of a furious, HBO induced, euphoric fit, they recorded an epic cover of the Game of Thrones theme song. Through powerful, Internet magic, the track made its way onto 5FM.

Now, armed with gut-punching rock ‘n roll, a combustive stage show, and badly wired pedal boards, All Guns Full Ammo is set explode. Literally.
