AKHLYS was created by Naas Alcameth (NIGHTBRINGER, BESTIA ARCANA) in 2009 to serve as a voice for the Muse that arises from the dark lands between death and dreams. A 37 minute single track dark ambient album entitled “Supplication” was released in limited number by Starlight Temple Society the same year. 

Since that time AKHLYS has been slowly fleshed anew arising again as a dark ambient and black metal unification, the reification of dream sojourn through the chambers of Yesod.
Latest album titled as "The Dreaming I" released on April 20th, 2015. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Akhlys">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
