After the breakup of Concealed Damage and almost two years of other separate projects, guitarists and former band mates Petr Oplatka and Cameron Stucky began working together again in late 2007. Before the spring of 2008, the pioneers had acquired Dan Saltzman on bass guitar and Daniel Larsen on the drums. They played as a four piece for some time before teaming up with Jacob Gittens to handle vocals - thus completing the lineup, broadening the songwriting process, and bringing together the brutal sound of a new project, Illucinus.

Their first work, "The Machine" (EP) features Illucinus in the prime ripening of their abilities. Larsen creates on-point drum fills in-between chunky blast-beats and heavy stokes; Oplatka and Stucky harmonize, shred, and destroy with their axes; Saltzman eats babies with his bass, and Gittens tops off the mix with his developed, intense vocal capabilities. Illucinus together creates a breed of death metal fusion that is musically intricate - melodic, progressive, and heavy - a very memorable combination of musical aspects.
