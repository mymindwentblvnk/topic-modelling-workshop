Mumrunner deal with aesthetics from contrasting aspects of sound: sometimes abrasive alternative rock melds with dream pop soundscapes that gives the impression of being otherworldly.  The Tampere, Finland based band love to play loud but never forsake an interest in subtler dynamics which makes Mumrunner's ambitions unique and special.

Forged from bands such as Getawaycab and Revival Hymns, Mumrunner impressed with their debut single Zit/Rut which caught interest and the imaginations of zines and blogs home and abroad.
