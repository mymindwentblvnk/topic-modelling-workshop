Internal Calibration Balance is a project I had to do due to the lack of musicians around me in Alice Springs Australia.
In late 2012 I decided to do nothing else except concentrate on music and creating it.
Spending most of 2012 in the bedroom writing songs, learning the craft of home recording, and building up gear, I now have the First album ready to record completely.
During this Time I have also become fortunate enough to Have Mark Hawkins doing the Work on the follow up EP.
Although I.C.B. is currently in the bedroom, plans of playing as a "a one man band" have always been on the cards.
The Point of this Is fun and fun first, Other musicians are welcome to join live but the music will always be written and composed by myself, the more I write the more personal it becomes and the more fun I have with the project.
