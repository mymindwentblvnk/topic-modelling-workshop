RetroSatan was a heavy/thrash metal band from Argentina formed in the 80's. One of the members of the band, Ruben, left because the style changed more Thrash. Then Diego, Claudio, and Marcelo joined at the end, but the band fell apart before they could record new songs. Marcelo two years later (1991) formed a short-lived project called Grito Mortal with two other Retrosatan members. Their album Grito Mortal was originally a demo called "Grito Mortal En Vivo". Re-released in 2005 by the
Brazilian label Dies Irae. Very limited LP edition with gatefold cover, including pics and flyer prints. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Retrosatan">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
