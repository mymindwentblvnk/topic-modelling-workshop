Trinitron Meets the Mars People is a Dance/Math rock band from Walnut, California. The band features a combination of musicians that have played and have interacted in the San Gabriel's ever changing Prog/math/hardcore/Indie scenes. Their sound is a combination of Minus the Bear-esque guitar-taps and Keys, with minimal sophisticated time signatures and a majority of Dance beats. The name "Trinitron Meets the Mars People" comes from an inside joke amongst current and recurring band members, Gabe and Reginald..

In June, 2007, Brandon, Drummer for Trinitron,  then Bassist for Indie band The Ready Aim Fire! contacted Guitarist Raymond Markel in hopes of kick starting the then-Two-Pieced band into a Trio with a regular Bassist for Trinitron.


In late September, 2007 the band, with the help of The Ready Aim Fire!'s Dave Trautz and Donavan Foy recorded their first EP, titled Cho Chang vs Margaret Yang. October 12th, 2007 the band played their first show at The Wire Music and Art Venue with a line-up that featured San Francisco natives We Be The Echo and Los Angeles journeymen, Ninja Academy.

The band's first full length album, titled Mars People Meets the Trinitron, was recorded in late April, 2008, and contains 12 tracks. AH HAAHA HA goes this Hilarious Hyena, the ninth track on the album features guest vocals from recurring keyboardist and member of The Ready Aim Fire! Dave Trautz. It is the only song with vocals. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Trinitron+Meets+the+Mars+People">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
