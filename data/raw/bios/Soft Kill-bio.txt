Soft Kill is the post-punk brainchild of Tobias Grave (Blessure Grave). In fall 2010, the project started demoing their first tracks which already showed their shared devotion to goth and post punk acts of the early 80’s. Indeed, the band’s debut full-length, “An Open Door”, is haunted by the ghosts of The Cure, Killing Joke and Magazine. In the seething restraint of “Borders Comfort” full of skittering single-note guitar runs, one hears the echoes of Joy Division’s propulsive dirges, while the new wave bounce of “Sea Of Doubt” is an heir to such art-damaged synth pop as Wire’s classic “154”.

Soft Kill clearly revere these inspirations, but their music - a style they’ve dubbed “Based Goth” - is its own animal, part of a lineage but unafraid to evolve into something new. October 2012 sees the release of the long awaited new single “Seven Hundred”, followed by the band’s second album in Spring 2013. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Soft+Kill">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
