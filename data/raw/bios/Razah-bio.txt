Born in Jamaica but raised in Brooklyn, R&B singer Razah grew up surrounded by crime, violence, and drugs. With a strong-willed mother, Razah survived the tough environment without ever falling prey to the street life. He took music seriously while in school and hung out at the famous Don One studio in Brooklyn after class. Seeing everyone from Wayne Wonder to Shabba Ranks come to the studio strengthened Razah's reggae roots and whetted his appetite for stardom. Years of sending out demos led to a meeting with the production team Manhood Entertainment and a single, "Feel So Good." The sweet, breezy, and independently released single sparked a bidding war with major labels fighting to sign the smooth singer. A track dedicated to his mother, "Feel So Good" became a regular spin on R&B radio in late 2004. With reggae, R&B, and hip-hop all in the mix, the singer's debut album, Breath of Fresh Air, was released in early 2005. ~ David Jeffries, All Music Guide <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Razah">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
