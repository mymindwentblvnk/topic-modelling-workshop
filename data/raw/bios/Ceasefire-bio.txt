They have previously released the singles " In The Dead Of Night" "It's You" "Heartache" "Heaven Knows" and "This Love Will Tear Us Apart". A new single "No Tomorrow" as well as an album with a full release is expected in 2014.

Former member Brandon Franklin left January 2013 to be replaced by Danny Molloy who stayed until January 2014. They are managed by the very talented Gabriel Lee.

The sum total of Ceasefire can be broken down into the individual parts that compose this project of passion. Where music is just a pastime or hobby for some, Ray Alexander (vocals), Kamren Alexander (guitar), Tristan Montgomery (bass) and Anthony Hainsworth (drums) believe in it as a lifestyle. And while the band’s name may indicate a pause in the action, the music is a bombastic expression of the human experience and they’ve only just begun.

Ceasefire have one goal and that is to be a sonic force of a rock band that moves the head as well as the strings of the heart. Formed in 2011 and based in Orange County, CA they are known foremost for their incredible live performances, Ray’s captivating vocal presence and Kamren’s razor sharp guitar hooks that are part art, part science. Theirs is a sound that channels 80s new wave, 90s arena rock and elements of homage to their broad stretch of influences which range from Joy Division to Oasis & Coldplay, The Killers to Imagine Dragons, Morrissey to Pink Floyd and the Cure to ELO (yes, that ELO).

How Ceasefire came to be follows the same pattern as many other bands: we have the Myspace classifieds to thank for Anthony and from a mutual friend’s astute referral came Tristan Montgomery Brothers Ray and Kamren seemed to know at an early age that music was their future and have become the band’s primary lyricists and the songs are what their feelings sound like. A melody, a guitar tone, a chord or an audio experiment can be the catalyst for what eventually becomes the next dynamic song like the post-punk air strike, “Heaven Knows.” They were formerly known as Stereofix.

“This is a band that plays the same sort of rock that fills arenas at every U2 show” - Orange County Music Examiner 

And arenas are what Ceasefire is aiming for. In 2011 the boys entered the studio with Tim Palmer (U2, Ozzy Osbourne, Blue October) and Paul Fox (Faker, There Might Be Giants) to record their first single, "This Love Will Tear Us Apart," & in 2013 the boys entered the studio with Josh Mosser (Imagine Dragons, Iron Man 3: Heroes Fall, Christina Aguilera, Skylar Grey) and Mark Needham (Imagine Dragons, Neon Trees, Walk The Moon, Youngblood Hawke) to record their newest EP, "In The Dead of Night EP" featuring their first single, "In The Dead Of Night," which is one of their favourite and most propulsive songs to play live. They’ve shared the stage with Everclear, Daughtry and Dramarama, were nominated for Best Live Band at the 2012 OC Music Awards and have had their music featured in episodes of MTV programs such as The Hills, The City and The Real World. This is a band on the ascent. They also in 2014 have regularly all year been in the top 5 with their single "Wake Up" on the World Famous KROQ Locals Only Playlist vote.
