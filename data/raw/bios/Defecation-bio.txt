Defecation is a death metal / grindcore side project formed by Righteous Pigs guitarist Mitch Harris and then Napalm Death drummer Mick Harris in 1987. They released their first album Purity Dilution in 1989. This was to be their only release for fourteen years, as Mitch joined Napalm Death the same year. The project was put on hiatus in 1991 when Mick left both bands to form Scorn. 

A second album (Intention Surpassed) was recorded solely by Mitch and was released in 2003. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Defecation">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
