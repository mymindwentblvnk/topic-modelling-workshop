Blood by dawn was started in 2004, in Deland, FL by drummer Steve Scudero and at the time bassist Steve Tracey. Before their first cd was released, they had already acquired 2 new guitarists. Local shredder Derek Fleming, and long time friend and former band member Steve Stone. In 2007 the band parted ways with their original vocalist. Which led to a relentless search. After several attempts at finding a stable front man, they decided to look within the band. Then bassist, Steve Tracey stepped up to the plate and knocked it out of the park. The next step was to recruit long time friend, Delfin Rodriguez to take over on bass.


Now a fully formed unit, Blood by Dawn releases a new cd entitled "Upon the horizons of fate". Ready to destroy anything in its path. Blood by Dawn merges an old school Florida death metal attack, with a new school overall groove.
