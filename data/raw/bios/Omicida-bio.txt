OMICIDA are a new modern-day thrash metal band, as they wear their influences on the sleeves while adding their own unique flare with their extreme precision and break-neck, dual-guitar shredding. The band does not try and re-invent the wheel, they just add some new dynamics to it. Formed in Los Angeles (2014). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Omicida">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
