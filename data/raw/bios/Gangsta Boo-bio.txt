Gangsta Boo (born Lola Mitchell on July 27, 1979), also known as Lady Boo, was a member of the Memphis, Tennessee-based rap group Three 6 Mafia's Hypnotize Mindz.

She was the sole female member of the group, which she left after the release of the album When the Smoke Clears: Sixty-6, Sixty-1. Mitchell left the group due to a falling out with several of its members, and following a public conversion in 2001 to Christianity. In 2003, Mitchell said, regarding her religious faith, that she was "still making mistakes," though she was "learning from 'em now." She added that her "relationship with [her] higher power" was "a personal thing."

Name Change

"I wanted to change my name because of the stereotype that goes with 'Gangsta this' and 'Gangsta that.' "I wasn't living the gangster lifestyle, so I wanted to lose the name. Everybody was always telling me that it didn't fit me anyway. I was young. I grew up and matured, so I decided to go with 'Lady Boo,' since I say Lady Boo in my raps anyway." Since the release of her 2003 effort, she has maintained the emcee name "Gangsta Boo". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gangsta+Boo">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
