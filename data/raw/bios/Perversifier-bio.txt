Perversifier was born from the impure mind of K.Desecrator in the middle of 2009, as a one-man band.
A line-up is now established with Max Abomination (Nuclear Abomination, Gulag, Theraphim) on bass, and Glaurung (ex-Enthroned, Morbid Rites, Emptiness, NehÃ«mah) on drums.
Perversifier is for all those who have forget that metal is not about trends, female voices or stupid emo songs about adolescents problems, but only spikes, leather, alcohol, goats, destruction, debauchery and true passion.
