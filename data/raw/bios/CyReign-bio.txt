Band formely known as Star Scream.
A five-piece band from Belgrade, Serbia, assembled on April, 2007. After a few lineup changes band takes it's final form in november, 2010.

By combining all of their interests, thoughts and ideas, they were able to develop their own music style which is mostly influenced by mainstream metal and that has been labeled Cyreign as metalcore-melodic death metal band.

Curently CyReign is looking for a publisher for their first TBA album.
