Wehwalt is an individual in the sense defined by the german philosopher Max Stirner in his book Der Einzige und sein Eigentum ( The ego an dits own). He always refused to be limited to movements and schools. Since 1989, his conception of music leads him to a new attitude of no definition and a quest of new spaces of constant metamorphosis. Polymorphous entity, he gives priority to unique and spontaneous performances, combining unpredictable sonic textures with an inner self poetic inspiration in order to produce a « mise en abime » and a special kind of pyschic and physical creation.
