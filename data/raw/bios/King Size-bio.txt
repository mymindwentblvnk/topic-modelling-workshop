King Size


There are many groups with this name , but the best of all is in Bulgaria and it is one the most successful.
1) hard & heavy band from Belgrade, Serbia.
They have released one LP so far called "Whisper" in 2007.
Line Up:
Srdjan Jeremic - vocal
Aleksandar Sestak - drums
Vihor Ristic - bass
Danilo Petrovic - guitar

2) Fun-Punkband from Cuxhaven, Germany. Their current status is a local band, but they got more potential. If they don't know what to play as encore, they simply search in a book full of german nursery rhymes. They got a flavor for such things and of course for german folk music. The band consists of 4 people, 2 guitars, bass and drums.
