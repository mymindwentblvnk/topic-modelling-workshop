Uaral is a dark folk / doom metal band from Curic√≥, Chile formed in 1996 by Aciago (all instruments) and Caudal (vocals).
They have released four demos and two full-length albums, "Sounds of Pain..." (2005) and "Lamentos a poema muerto" (2007) - the latter contains only two new tracks, the other songs can be found on the "Laments" EP.

There was an old man named Uaral; when Aciago and Caudal were children, he used to tell them stories and teach them how to play music. When he passed away, they decided to form a band and christen it "Uaral" in his honor. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Uaral">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
