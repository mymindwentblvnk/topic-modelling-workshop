The band was formed in Norway in 1989 by guitarist Tore Østby, singer Dag Østby, drummer Werner Skogli and bassist Freddy Samsonstuen. In 1990, after a demo tape, Arve Heimdal replaced Werner Skogli and Ingar Amlien replaced Freddy Samsonstuen. A year later, Dag Østby quits, and the band is forced to search for a new vocalist. After many auditions, the band hooks up with Roy Sætre Khantatat (Roy Khan), a classically trained opera singer.

Their somewhat short-lived career (the band disbanded in 1997-8) was characterized by a unique and distinct sound on the power/progressive metal genre which was slightly altered with their last studio release, Flow.

Conception was reunited in 2005, playing the important American prog-metal festival Prog Power USA 2005 (Friday September 16) and Norwegian Scream Magazine 15 Years & 100 Issues Festival (Saturday October 1), bringing guitarist Tore Østby (Ark), singer Roy Khan (now lead singer of Kamelot) and the rest of the band back together.

Conception reunited again in 2018 and released an EP, My Dark Symphony.
