Glorior Belli is a black metal band from Auxerre, Burgundy, France. Their lyrics focus on Luciferianism, darkness, and the occult. Since 2011 they have included a blues inflected style in their black metal, creating a unique niche not found in other black metal bands.

Glorior Belli formed in 2002 with Antares & songwriter, guitarist, and vocalist Infestvvs. They released a demo titled Evil Archaic Order in June 2004, followed by the debut album Ô Lavdate Dominvs in May 2005 on CD by Eerie Art records (Chilean label Aquilus Cruoris released the LP, and Satanic Propaganda records released the casette). Their sophomore album Manifesting the Raging Beast was released by Southern Lord records in June 2007. These earlier albums are played in an "orthodox" black metal style common to mostly Scandinavian groups.
 Meet Us At The Southern Sign their third album was released on CD by Candlelight records June 2009 (German label Blut & Eisen released the LP) - on this album they began to include a blues style in their initially very "orthodox" black metal and also included clean vocals for the first time. They released a split 12" with Creeping called  Rites Of Spiritual Death on Necroterror records on the first of January 2011 that featured low pitch atypical vocals and a much more subdued style compared to their albums. They changed labels yet again for their fourth album The Great Southern Darkness released by Metal Blade records on CD in September 2011, taking their blues inflected style even farther than before and implementing clean vocals again. Their fifth and most recent album Gators Rumble, Chaos Unfurls was released by Agonia records in October 2013 on CD and LP.
