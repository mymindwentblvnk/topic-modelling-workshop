ASYNDESS started during summer 1994 as a one man band led by Loïc Cellier. After a year of intense composition, the first release "Illumination" is recorded in september 1995. In spite of a shity cover, this demo tape received good reviews and the name of ASYNDESS became known in the french undergound scene. The second recording took place 5 months later in january 1996. "Desesperances" is more an album than a simple demo but it was out on tape too. This one had a full color cover and was limited to 300 copies. The responses were pretty good. Italian label Polyphemus records [rip] (Novembre, Gospel of the horns, etc..) released "Desesperances" full lenght album in april 1997. Unfortunately due to some troubles inside this record compagny, no promotion has been done.
Third release "L'accomplissement" was recorded in january 1999 with the participation of G. Seron for the writing of the lyrics. Despite a promotional effort next to labels,"L'accomplissement" remained forgotten in darkness during 3 years of stand by. "L'accomplissement" went finally out in march 2002 on french label Sacral Productions.
Originally, Asyndess was Loïc's main band, along with the doom death act Despair's Tiny Things with whom he was playing. Then, he created Belenos on his own and started releasing demos of both Belenos and Asyndess until he decided to stop Asyndess and transformed Belenos into a true "live" band. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Asyndess">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
