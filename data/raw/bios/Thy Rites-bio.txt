Thy Rites was born in MMV to praise the name of Lord Satan and desecrate the weakling light of Jehova. Spiritually influenced by abominations of the Ancient Ones, Canonical Madness, Religious Debauchery, Horned Sodomy, Hateful Antichristianity, Demonical Fanatism, Divine Blasphemy, Apokalyptic Disgrace and glory of all Legions of Hell!!! Musically Thy Rites hail the Satanic Blackened Death Metal as it meant to be in honour to the old morbid way. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Thy+Rites">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
