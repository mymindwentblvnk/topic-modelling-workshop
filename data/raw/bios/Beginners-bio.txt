BEGINNERS is an American Electropop band formed in Los Angeles, CA in 2013. The group consists of vocalist Samantha Barbera, guitarist Bianca Posey, keyboardist Honor Nezzo and drummer Jason Walker. The band was formed in the Wiltern Theater in L.A. where after years apart when Barbera and Nick Ruth re-united to support their former drummer of Foster the People. It was that night that Barbera, (former vocalist of hardcore punk band Holy Fever), and Ruth (who has produced and written for artists such as Kelly Clarkson, Carly Rae Jepsen and Andy Grammer) found an instant chemistry together and became inspired to work together again. They embrace an unapologetic creative freedom and openly serve a blend of cutting-edge pop with textured elements from the trap and electronica with a punk rock spirit and catchy dance anthems.

Their self-titled debut EP, Beginners was released in 2014, with the track "Who Knows" being the hit single. Followed by their second EP Pleaser in 2016 which included hit singles like "Making Love to the Dead" and "Gangsters or Lovers". After the one year pause they released some independent singles like "Young And On Fire" and "Start A Riot" being the significant ones. These releases marked their turn to a more "edgy" pop style evolution and also helped to garner immediate recognition from the press, tours with bands like Walk The Moon and over 15 million streams on Spotify.

The single "Let That Money Talk" was released in February of 2018 which is confirmed to be included in their forthcoming album CREAM. The album is anticipated to feature major collaborations from artists like Kygo. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Beginners">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
