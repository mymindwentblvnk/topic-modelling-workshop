Valborg is an experimental blackened death/doom metal band from Bonn (NRW), Germany.

Valborg creates dense, inventive music that escapes categorization. The trio's blunt, forceful songs are at once raw yet hold a nihilistic sophistication that forges clouds of nightmarish atmosphere, giving them a narcotic, dreamlike feel that very few bands achieve.

"Formed in the spring of 2002, we spent the first year of our existence writing and recording material. Those songs ended up on our debut release in the summer 2003, titled "Songs for a Year" (Zeitgeister Music). From 2003 until 2006 we produced eight more experimental tracks, which are still unreleased. In the summer of 2007 we began writing new material, for what would eventually be called "Glorification of Pain," and entered Stonehenge Studio by December 2007. Nine tracks were recorded on analog equipment and everything was played "live", except for the vocals, some synths and some guitars. The main intention was to catch the true moments of playing together as a band and to get a more natural, dirty sound with an old school feeling. "Glorification of Pain" will be released in early 2009 by Vendlus Records. In December 2008 we entered the studio again to record the follow-up album "Crown of Sorrow". "
