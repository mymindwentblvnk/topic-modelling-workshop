London based, Belfast-born blogger-production-dj duo Matt McBriar and Andy Ferguson need little by way of introduction. Their 'FeelMyBicep blog" is the go-to place for taste makers world-wide for lost and forgotten disco / chicago house / detroit techno / Italo edits and everything in-between.

On a production tip, they have released on such labels as Throne Of Blood, Traveller Records, Mystery Meat and 2012 saw their critically acclaimed vinyl only track $tripper get released on Love Fever hitting the top chart spots on Juno and selling out worldwide. Their remix track record has also been excellent with them stamping their distinguished sound upon works from Blondes, Toby Tobias, Chamboche, Blood Orange, Cosmic Kids and many more for labels such as Domino, Wolf Music and Tusk. Now they have been snapped up by Will Saul's Aus label with a collaborative EP including tracks “You” and “Don't” which once again hit number one on Juno and has been causing the Beatport charts some bother. 

Bicep have two albums and a handful of singles, EPs, and remixes. Their eponymous album, Bicep, was released in 2017 and achieved major critical acclaim, including being named the #1 album of 2017 by Mixmag. Their follow-up album, Isles, was released in January 2021 to generally favourable reviews. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bicep">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
