The album Preemptive Strike actually belongs to the band Entrenched (USA) of the same name but from a different country.  They have another page under Entrenched (USA) to clarify.
Entrenched emerged from the trenches of New Jersey when Sean and Charles started jamming together in September 2009. Once songs started being written nonchalance turned into brutality par excelance. Like munitions manufactured in times of war; riff after riff, song after song, Entrenched wrote with skill, passion, and precision . The recording campaign of the first full length began in November 2009 and carried on into the spring of 2010. It was recorded in Charlesâ€™ subterranean command bunker and nothing but perfection was acceptable. After a lengthy recruiting campaign and one conscription, Entrenched enlisted Michael Mullins to perform some additional solos. The album was finished and mixed in August 2010 and was mastered by Alan Douches at WWSM. The first Entrenched record is being prepared for deployment and is soon to be unleashed upon mankind. Look out for Entrenched in the year 2011.
