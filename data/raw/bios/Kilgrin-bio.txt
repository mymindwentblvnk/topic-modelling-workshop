The story of Kilgrin begins in 2009, when partycoverband Ulisevat Rakkarit (Howling Hooligans in english) was found. The band of four played several gigs in parties, bars and youth centers. In 2010 band decided to take a more serious approach to their playing and few own written songs were made. A new singer, fifth member, was hired to band and they recorded a demo recording, played gigs and took part in Ääni ja Vimma 2011 competition in Helsinki. Soon the band was back to four members, when the new singer and band decided to part their ways in spring 2011. In spring and summer 2012 the band recorded a three-song EP Come with Me Now, which was published in July 2012. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kilgrin">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
