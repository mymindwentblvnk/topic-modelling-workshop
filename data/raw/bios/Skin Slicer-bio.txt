Formed in 2007 by Jimbo, Skin Slicer is a tribute to 80's Thrash Metal. Not supposed to be a "serious" band but more a sideline project. They're first promo "Thrash in Hell", out in 2007 was the intro about a concept for they're first full LP "Made in Hell" (out in 2008) in the same way of Venom, Possessed, Old Bathory with "Hell" words abuse and demonic hellish lyrics. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Skin+Slicer">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
