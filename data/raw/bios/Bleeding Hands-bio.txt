Bleeding Hands are a Metal Trio based in the heart of Gothenburg, Sweden, consisting of three young metal musicians. The trio was created in late October of 2014 with one simple goal, to make melodic and interesting heavy music. Due to the great musical chemistry they have already recorded a full length album.
 Bleeding Hands have created their sound by blending heavy metal, old school thrash, melodic death and progressive metal with their own unique sound. Still keeping it interesting is a main objective, with crispy rock and roll vocals, characterized by its bay area influences, as well as intriguing rhythms and lyrics that still doesn’t diminish the fact that they have catchy riffs, dynamic songs and a great stage presence. 
 Their first album ”Lost Integrity” was released in July of 2015 and contains a mixture of different styles, but it all comes back to the shared passion for hard music and the need to make something new. 
The album was released through aMadea Music and is available all over the world, and is distributed to music stores all over Sweden.
 In november BH got through to the final stages of the Sweden Rock competition among thousands of applicants and Hard Rock magazines all over have reached out to review the album which we are looking forward to in 2016.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bleeding+hands">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
