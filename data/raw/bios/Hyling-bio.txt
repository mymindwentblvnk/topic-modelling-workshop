Hyling is a black metal band born in 2000, consisting of Claudio "Goatlord" on drums and Federico on guitars.
Francesco and Claudio C. joined the band as bass player and singer respectively the year later.

The first album was recorded at Remaster Studio (by Tony Fontò and Nick Savio of Whiteskull band) in June 2002 and (self) released in 2003 with the name "Last Winter".

After the recording session Claudio C. left the band cause of some incomprehensions so, he appeared as session voice.

In November 2005 the band returned to Remaster Studio to record 7 new songs with a new session singer, Tyrant-X (ex guitarist of the band Fucktory-X).
Two weeks later "Lethargy" was complete. Because of some problems, it was published in 2010 (by The Oath Record).

Meanwhile Claudio "Goatlord" left the band to focus on other black metal projects (Horta Funebra, Esequiem, Malaflame).

The year later Francesco and Federico decided to record another album.
Helped by Enrico (ex Riul Doamnei) on drums, they started writing new songs.
In February 2014 Patrik Carlsson (singer/guitarist of the Swedish bands Anachronaeon and Eyecult) joyned Hyling as session voice.
The recording session began in July 2013 at Hyling Studio by Giorgio Maraia (Riul Doamnei Keyboardist).
All voices were recorded at Anachronaeon Liar Studio in Vësterås (Sweden) by Mattias Balk (Anachronaeon Bass player) in February 2014.
