SweetHard is an international rock band founded by Dexter on June 2007. The average age of the band is around 18-19 years old. Some weeks later Johny L. (bass), Anto (guitar) and Jury (voice) joined the band. 
They started to play some covers while the started conposing their own songs and real soon, in July 2007, they already had a few good songs and so they started recording a little project. This project was going to consist of 8 songs, but it was later reduced to only four including "I die a little more" and "are you ready".
It was later on when Dexter got in touch with Negro, a drummer. They rapidly started playing with him and decided to have him as the drummer of SweetHard. The songs started to get a mayor personality specially when practicing. In October 2007 Anto left the band due to internal problems, this left them with only one guitar, Dexter. 
SweetHard continued their way and they started to play in clubs of Madrid. Now a days they are recording new songs that will come out soon.     <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/SweetHard">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
