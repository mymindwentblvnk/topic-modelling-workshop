Long ago, in early 2010, somewhere in the bitter cold of New Hampshire, a terrifying storm was brewing. That storm was actually a metaphor for an increased rate of herpes at Keene State College, but Zombie Fighter also formed at that time (and in no way has anything to do with said herpes).  

Zombie Fighter brings an aggressive style of thrash metal from an area otherwise devoid of heavy music. These fine young lads want only one thing... BEER! And also to kick your ass with blistering guitar solos, thrash beats, and groovy bass lines.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Zombie+Fighter">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
