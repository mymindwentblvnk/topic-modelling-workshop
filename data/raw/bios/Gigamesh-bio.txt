Gigamesh has been making his mark for several years in dance clubs around the world with his own popular blend of remixes, as well as his work with remix group DiscoTech, and his role in Señor Stereo, a disco influenced live-electronic group. Today,Consequence of Sound exclusively premiered the a mixtape, featuring exclusive remixes of Katy B, Theophilus London and Afrojack, that he made especially for Thursday September 22nd’s Check Yo Ponytail show at El Rey. Gigamesh will share the bill that night with Miami Horror, Class Actress, LA Girlfriend and Franki Chan. You can hear and download the “Check Yo Ponytail” mixtape on Consequence of Sound.

Gigamesh will release his debut self-titled EP October 18 through Our Label International. Fans will also have the chance to buy the extended version of the singleWhen You’re Dancing Ft. Induce exclusively on Beatport starting October 4th. Known for pushing the boundaries of dance music, Gigamesh opens the EP with disco-infused single “When You’re Dancing (feat. Induce)” with a hook that commands you to move. “It’s So Intense” lives up to its name as a hazy synth-driven club banger. EP closer “People” shows the melodic side of Gigamesh, lead by melodic vocals from Nicole Godiva while still incorporating bass guitar and synths.

Gigamesh has received considerable attention and support from DJs as diverse as DJ AM and Brodinski to Busy P and Fare Soldi for his bootleg remixes of artists like Animal Collecitve, Lykke Li and Radiohead, the latter two of which hit #1 on the Hype Machine. Through his widespread success, Gigamesh was hired to remix Mike Posner’s “Cooler Than Me” in late 2009. Ultimately chosen to be the first single on Posner’s debut album, the Gigamesh version went on to sell over 2.5 million copies and hit the#6 position on Billboard. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gigamesh">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
