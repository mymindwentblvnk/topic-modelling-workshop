Aleks and the Drummer are a farfisa organ and drums duo from Chicago. They have recently recorded their first EP, "May A Lightning Bolt Caress You!" at Staygold Studio with producer Dave Sitek and engineer Chris Coady.

this is aleks adding to the post above: i don't know what stuff is posted here, i don't use last.fm as much as i'd like to. i just wanted to say that i think some of this stuff up here is from the demo days. it gives you the idea, but we have amazing sound on the professional recordings. you can buy the ep in chicago, london, and Brooklyn for now. it's cheap, or listen on our myspace page to check if you're listening to the good stuff here.

thanks
aleks
