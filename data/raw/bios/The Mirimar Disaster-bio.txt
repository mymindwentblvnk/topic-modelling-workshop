The Mirimar Disaster ... a sonic creation merging metal, noisecore, sludge and ambient sounds ... a brutal, yet intelligent combination of forward thinking guitar based music...
...each member's musical past, and influences, have ensured that 'The Mirimar Disaster' have their very own unique sound.

The five piece metallic assault was formed in Sheffield late 2003, when Slomo, Frank and Dean's former band separated, and they went in search of a new bass player and new direction.  Nicky was quickly recruited on bass, and three songs soon followed.  In the late Spring of 2004, Stocky was added on vocals to complete the line up, and two further songs were written.

After three months of writing and rehearsing in Sheffield's infamous 'Jump Studios', the band made their debut live performance on August 13th 2004, at 'The Grapes' in Sheffield, UK. The show was a total success, with people having to be turned away, and the band receiving a great reviews from the local press.

Over the last twelve months, the band have played in excess of 25 shows, and have played with such acts as Cult of Luna, 3 Stages of Pain, Mistress, Eden Maine, 65daysofstatic, Snowblood, and many, many more all over the UK. The band also spent the early part of summer '05, recording their first five tracks, at 2Fly Studios in Sheffield. The response to this first demo was somewhat outstanding.

The band have since secured a deal with Undergroove records and a self titled debut album was released on 19th March 2007.

In June 2007 Stocky (vocals) left the band.

In August 2009 they announced they has disbanded via their myspace page. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Mirimar+Disaster">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
