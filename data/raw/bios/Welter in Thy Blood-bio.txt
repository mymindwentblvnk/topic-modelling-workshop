Welter In Thy Blood is a three piece black doom project from Los Angeles, California.
 
      
Since 2006 they have had the distinction of being both innovators and outcasts among the black metal scene. Obscure, extreme and unattainable; this is art... it's not about fame or glory. Rather than attempt to usurp some apocryphal throne, Welter In Thy Blood possess the rare strength and perseverance to blaze their own path. Their uncompromising collective vision presents an exclusive aural documentation of the unquestionable decay of human existence. The elegies of Welter In Thy Blood speak of their virulent hate of human existence and the lauding of death and solitude. Revealed through a staggering funeral cadence and guttural ululations is a feeling of absolute torment and despondency.  Like a putrid mass for an unholy God.


Welter In Thy Blood released their fourth album, Todestrieb, a violent storm of hate and despondency through the Italian label Dusktone Records.
