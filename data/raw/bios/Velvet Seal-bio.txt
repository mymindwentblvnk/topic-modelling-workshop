Velvet Seal is a young symphonic gothic metal band that formed in 2006 in Hungary. They released a four track demo in 2007 and started working on a full-length album after that. The band actually finished the album, but released this four track promo to gain label attention for the actual release of the album. The members are Gabee (vocals), Csabee (guitars & synths), David (bass), Bali (drums). 
The idea of the band came early summer of 2006, after having numerous reherseals with a former Hungarian band, searching for something even more, experimenting, gothic, modern, but at the same time both popular and a little more challenging musically. The concept was to form a band, that is mainly gothic with a strong female voice, and to add bit from the all other music that influenced the composer, and thus having something unique. The strong symphonic arrangements, together with the dark, sometimes even a little bit progressive guitar riffs, all softened by incredible vocals and melodies, form the music of Velvet Seal.
