EarthGang (stylized EARTHGANG) is an American hip hop duo from Atlanta, Georgia, composed of rappers known by their stage names, Johnny "Olu O. Fann" Venus and Doctur "Eian Undrai Parker" Dot.[1][2][3] Formed in 2008, EarthGang released its first EP, The Better Party, in 2010. This was followed by several singles and three albums, including Mad Men and Good News in 2011, and Shallow Graves For Toys in 2013. The latter peaked at No. 11 on the Billboard Emerging Artists chart and was largely well-received, with Noisey calling it "one of the most well thought-out releases of the year" and praising the album's "playful delivery and biting lyricism."

In late 2017, they signed to J. Cole's label, Dreamville records (following a release of a three EP trilogy).
