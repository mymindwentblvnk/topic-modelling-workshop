Initially formed in 1999 by high school friends Travis Nesbitt (vocals) and Logan Jacobs (bass), Canadian alternative rock act Social Code was originally called Fifth Season. The LP Patiently Waiting was released in 2001, and the group later changed names to their present alias upon finding their original moniker to be popular already with a group overseas. Inking a deal with Interscope in late 2003, the band released their debut album as Social Code, A Year at the Movies, in May 2004. Dates that fall were spent on the road in Canada headlining shows with Bif Naked and the guys from television's Jackass. A few lineup changes occurred over the years; after guitarist David Hesse left the band in the mid-2000s, Chris Ruddy (ex-Drive by Punch) soon joined on to complete Nesbitt, Jacobs, and drummer Ben Shillabeer. Ruddy was later replaced by Morgan Gies on guitar. Social Code also opened for Good Charlotte on select Canadian dates during their 2005 tour. ~ Corey Apar, All Music Guide <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fifth+Season">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
