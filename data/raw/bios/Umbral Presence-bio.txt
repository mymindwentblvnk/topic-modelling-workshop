The project was formed in 1997 by Rustam (Noctulius), the Rakoth's vocalist and keyboard player as a more brutal and occult-oriented alternative to Rakoth. The first demo-tape, "... et germinet Chaos", was recorded in 1998 by Noctulius alone and featured five tracks. The tape was distributed by Elven Witchcraft Distribution and was accepted ok by extreme metal audience. In 2000 Noctulius invites Lidagon (Alex "Lex" Plotnikoff, Glazemaker guitarist) as a session guitarist and they record the first full-length album, "Caelethi I". Album was locked in the desk for quite awhile, until in 2006 Noctulius decides to re-record it with proper sound and performance quality. After that the deal with Sound Age Productions (Moscow) was signed and the album was released. Currently the new album (so far titled "Caelethi II" - surprise!) is under development.
