Red Scalp was formed in 2012 but its origins go back to 2011 when Łukasz Dąbkiewicz after meeting with Mateusz Półtorak decided to form a band. At first it supposed to be a progressive metal band. Many musicians, more or less engaged, came and went but each and every one of them contributed something. From progressive metal through metalcore and many other genres the band has finally decided to play a stoner/southern metal. Luckily the duo has met a guitarist interested in playing that kind of music. It was Jędrek Wawrzyniak, who immediately liked the vibe. After a few months of exhausting rehearsals guys were on the edge due to the lack of bassist. Then there was the right man at the right time – Łukasz Jankowski. At this point they had everything they needed to conquer the world. Having this line-up they played one concert which, to say the least, sucked ass… The band lacked one important ingredient – vocals that would grab everybody’s balls and squeeze them dry. There were a few candidates, but only one was the right one – Michał Małachowski whose voice is so metal that he breathes out rust.  Red Scalp has only one goal – to play music that will be the pure essence of a strong impact, energy and melodic vocals, as heretofore and forever, as long there will be people to listen to this. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Red+Scalp">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
