Formed in Southern New Jersey, this 3-piece alt-punk outfit has pushed the boundaries of not only band names, but what people consider "Punk". 
Their self-proclaimed genre of "Not-The Worst 'Other-Sounding' Band in South Jersey” has gotten people to notice guitar player Brandon Smith’s unique voice and songwriting, coupled with the double-bass pounding drums artfully crafted by drummer BJ Pettit. 

Their full-length debut Welcome To Rio Grande has shown their diversity and passion as a band. It's one album that you don't wanna miss out on.
