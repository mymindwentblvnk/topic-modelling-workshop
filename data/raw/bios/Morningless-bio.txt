Line up changes and humble demos, ups and downs, death and rebirth, Morningless has gone through a lot to become what it is right now. Starting up from nothingness and inexperience in 2002 and splitting up  after a satisfying five years filled with joy and sweat, the band is now rising up from its ashes after a long break with a first full length album in hands. The fruit of a spark that lit the flame back, solid friendship and a lot of time, goodwill and efforts, Distance is an offering to old and new fans alike. With this new weapon of theirs and a perfectly fitting line-up, Morningless is cranked up and ready to hit the stage once again.

Our album Distance can be downloaded for free (donations are welcome) from our website. A FLAC-encoded version is even available from our Facebook page at http://www.facebook.com/morningless.
