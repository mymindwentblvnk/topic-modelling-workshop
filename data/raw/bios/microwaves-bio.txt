An annoying pain in the ass since 2000 or so, Microwaves have been committed to creating a blues-free environment with varying degrees of success. The past few years have seen even the most noble of intentions collide with ego to yield a membership that has always been in flux and has seen even the best fall prey to the industry. With this in mind, Microwaves must dare to forge beyond such passive aggressive scenarios.

Previously operating as a trio, the Kuzy/Roman axis remains intact. After repeated line-up changes Microwaves now omits the use of a bassist altogether with surprising results. Modern day noise rock for modern problems that utilizes guitar, drums and electronics in a way not quite done before.
