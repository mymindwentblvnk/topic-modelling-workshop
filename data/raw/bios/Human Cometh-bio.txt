It all started in December 2009 when guitarist Morgan Pettersson invited singer Kaj Roth to sing on one of his new songs and 2 months later, a full album of 9 songs was recorded and tracked with the steady rhythm section of drummer Jon Robbins and bassist Bjorn Pehrson. Not to mention the lovely background vocals by Steven Gardner which is just an important cornerstone of the Human Cometh sound as Kaj..s unique voice, Morgan..s fantastic six string work, Jon..s heavy metalhead drumming and Bjorn..s thundering bass.The music is written by Morgan Pettersson. The words to No Fear + Stalker in the night+ Jaded are written by singer/songwriter David Rice and Morning Star the words are co-written with Kaj Roth. We are happy to announce that Human Cometh will release a 2nd CD in 2010 with the working title HCII! But for now, our debut cd "Evolution" is available now with awesome artwork by Anders Plassgard!
