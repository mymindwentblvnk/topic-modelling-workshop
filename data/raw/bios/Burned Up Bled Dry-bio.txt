Hardcore/Grind outfit from Arkansas. Started in 1996, toured and recorded heavily until a 1999 hiatus, then got back together in 2005 and just recently released a split with Arkansas' crusty-sludgy, Deadbird (Ex-Rwake). BUBD is obviously influenced by 90's fastcore, like Despise You, and Capitalist Casualties, only with a darker tone. On the Deadbird split, they have a more modern, melodic hardcore sound Aka. They've had two 7" EPs (one on Slap-A-Ham), the recent split with Deadbird, and appear on the famous Bllleeeeaaauuurrrrgghhh! - A Music War compilation. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Burned+Up+Bled+Dry">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
