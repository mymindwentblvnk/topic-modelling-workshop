Straight from the big São Paulo, Brazil, Victor Ruiz lives for music since his youth, when started to play the bass guitar, at the tender age of 10.

He was introduced to the Electronic Music world by a friend, who is a Techno Music producer. With the help of this friend, he began to produce his own tunes. His influences are a gathering of lots of kinds of music, including Heavy Metal, Techno and Motion Soundtracks. With 19 years of age, he graduated the Electronic Music Production course at the Anhembi Morumbi University on the year of 2008. Victor makes a very powerfull and personal Minimal Techno, which is a solid mix of singular textures with the strangest melodies and always leaded by a strong and hard bass line. In other words: perfect for the dance floor.

Having remixed tracks from Smokers Area & BoomCardona(Converge), Bigger Than Jesus (Excentric Music), André Bastos (Lo Kik),and having his tracks remixed by Nathan F. (Autist), Minicoolboyz (Minus), and Bigger Than Jesus(Excentric Music), beside reaching the Top 100 Minimal at Beatport twice he is a phenomenon in the making.
