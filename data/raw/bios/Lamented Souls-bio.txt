Doom metal band from Norway (Kolbotn). Formed in 1991. You can call it a supergroup - the members are Apollyon (Aura Noir, Immortal, Apostasy, Cadaver, ex-Dodheimsgard), ICS Vortex (Arcturus, ex-Borknagar, ex-Dimmu Borgir), Bestial Tormentor (Boh, Demon Cleaner, Inferno), Necrodevil (Beyond Dawn, Inferno, Virus). It was the first band Simen Hestn√¶s aka ICS Vortex ever did vocals for (on the second demo, he played drums on the first). 

They are currently recording a new album tentatively titled "Echelons of Decay" due for release Fall '10. One of the tracks off the album was played at a live show in early 2010.
