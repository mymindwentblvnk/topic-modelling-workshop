In Ovo formed in late 2006 with members from other San Antonio area local bands.  Line up struggles have plagued the band over the last three years they believe they have finally found their definitive lineup.  The name In Ovo comes from the book Imajica by Clive Barker. In Imajica, there are five Dominions. The first four Dominions are reconciled, which means you can pass freely from one to another; like crossing a state line or a bridge. The Fifth Dominion, Earth, is unreconciled, which means you cannot pass freely from one to another. The In Ovo is a limbo between the Reconciled and Unreconciled Dominions. It requires a great deal of skill, magic, and knowledge to pass into the Reconciled Dominions, and an even greater amount of skill to survive the In Ovo.

The In Ovo is a wasteland that you must cross through to get from Earth to the Reconciled Dominions and vise versa. Some of the creatures in the In Ovo, called Oviates, are nothing but wasted life forms that are 'no more than scraps from a cannibal's table, sucked bloodless and gnawed: idiot doodles of life that don't bear translation into any material form'. They are creatures the sun would never see, their paths lit by their own luminescence. Other creatures, like Voiders and Gek-A-Geks, are more sinister. These are beasts that have no purpose in life other than death. They are uncontrollable, unnatural, and pure iniquity. They have forms and appetites that no book has ever set down. They have rages and frustrations that are centuries old.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/In+Ovo">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
