There are 2 bands with the same name.
 The epic-Black-Death-Metal-sounding band is from Germany.
 The others are playing swedish Death Metal from, uhm… Sweden.

 I guess you guys are able to hear the difference.


 If you like the epic version from Upper Franconia, Germany click here and use the „like it“-button:

 If you enjoy the swedish guys click here and ask for friendship:

Both would be best.
