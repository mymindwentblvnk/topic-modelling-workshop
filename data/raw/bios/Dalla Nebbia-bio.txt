Dalla Nebbia is an American quartet featuring a layered organic style rooted in atmospheric black metal but adding in progressive and heavy doom components. Formed in 2010 by founding members Yixja (Guitar) and Zduhac (Vocals), the two would go on to release two digital only releases, "From The Fog" (2011) and "Thy Pale Form..." (2012). At the end of 2012 the band would go on to record their first full length album, entitled "The Cusp of the Void". This album featured new recordings of the previously released songs and feature the band's two newest members, Alkurion (drums) and Tiphareth (bass), resulting in an enhanced listening experience full of complexity. The album also featured a cover of the Windir classic, "Black New Age".  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dalla+Nebbia">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
