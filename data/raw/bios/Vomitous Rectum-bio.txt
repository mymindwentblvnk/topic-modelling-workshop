Vomitous Rectum is a brutal death metal/grind band that formed mid 2005 in New York. The band recorded a 4 song demo, and only played two shows before splitting up in 2006. During that time, however, Grindethic Records decided to remaster and release the demo as part of the 3 way split CD with Putrefy and Blasphtized. The 2008 release of "Vomiting Putrid Blasphemy" brought about the reunion of all four original members. Shortly after the release however, Mark (drums) had to leave the band, but was replaced with Ryan McKenna. With that lineup in place, the band recorded their debut full length CD, "A Series of Brutal Moments" in late 2008. The CD was released in August 2009 on Gutterchrist Productions. In April of 2010, The band reunited again with all four original members and entered the studio to record 4 brand new songs, which will be released as a split CD during summer 2010. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vomitous+Rectum">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
