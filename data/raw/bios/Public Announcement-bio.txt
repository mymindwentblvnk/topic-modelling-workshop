Public Announcement, originally known as MGM, is an R&B and hip hop group formed in Chicago, Illinois, in 1989 by R. Kelly. After releasing a single for the local Tavdash label in 1990, they eventually signed with Jive Records in 1991 and released their debut album, Born Into the '90s, in 1992. Led by Kelly, the group scored hits such as She's Got That Vibe, Honey Love, Slow Dance and Dedicated, eventually reaching a million copies going platinum. After a tour, Kelly left the group to start a solo career that continues today, whereas the group was suddenly left in limbo after his departure. They scored their only Top 5 hit without Kelly in 1998 with Body Bumpin' Yippie-Yi-Yo, from the album All Work, No Play. This album featured Felony Davis taking over for Kelly. In 2000, they scored another Top 40 hit with Mamacita, from their eponymous album on Epic, but it wasn't as big as any of their Kelly-led hits. There were rumors around 2004 that Kelly was looking to produce a new album with the group, but nothing has yet come of it.
In 2006, Public Annoucement released their fourth album "When The Smoke Clears" on their own label, Boss Entertainment, through Fontana Music/Universal Records. After a short hiatus to pursue solo interests, Earl, Glenn, Feloney, and Mar-K are working on a follow-up album, expected to be released in 2011.
