Progress Of Inhumanity was formed in 2006 in Athens,Greece by 3 friends named Patroklos (ex-From The Basement,ex-Collateral damage),Kostas (ex-Collateral damage),Nick (also in Vulnus,Mencea). The purpose was and still is to play raw and fast grindcore with soul and spirit. Sick of today's hypes and trends they started jamming some tunes and rapidly came up with their own material. After some gigs here and there between 2007-2009 with local bands and well-known bands like EXTREME NOISE TERROR and BIRDFLESH,Progress of inhumanity encouraged by the positive feedback entered the studio for the first time. Having already composed 21 tracks the time was right to record their very first full-length. The recordings took place at a close friend's studio from January to February 2009.The whole project was recorded,mixed and mastered by Stelios Pifeas and the band itself. At the time,the band is looking for a proper label to release their debut album and play more shows within Greece and abroad.
