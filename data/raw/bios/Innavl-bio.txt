Innavl was originally conceived as a 3-man band, but the former guitarist was appearently kicked out of the band (And beaten severely) for cutting his hair short.

The members behind Innavl are Lord Drakh and Count Morloch, two kvltists of considerable infamy. Both share a burning passion for black metal, as well a formidable history of mental illness.
