EVERFEST was founded in Dec 2002 in Frankfurt, Germany. The Band plays classic Heavy Metal with Power- and Prog Metal influence. In Feb 2004 the band recorded a professional 4-Track Demo-EP with producer Marc Bugnard (ex-ROKO). The Demo was a big success and the band was chosen by METAL HAMMER Germany and the W:O:A-Team to play a show at the world famous WACKEN OPEN AIR - FESTIVAL.  When "Rising" was released in 2006 everybody knew there will be more and so the fans, still enjoying the numerous gigs in the Rhein-Main-Region, are waiting to get some more ass kicking songs of this powerful band. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Everfest">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
