Trees of Eternity came into being when Juha Raivio (Swallow the Sun) and Sweden based singer Aleah got together in the latter part of 2008 to work on a song for the upcoming STS album. The plan was to to feature Aleah’s vocals on part of a song already prepared by Juha, but when they instead began to experiment with a vocal line Aleah had written for the occasion the session quickly headed off in a new direction and the project took on a life on its own.

Since then several more songs have been written and roughly produced, but the intention is to polish it all up during spring 2009 and complete a five song promo for label presentation. 

Members:
Aleah Stanbridge - vocals (2009–2016; died 2016)
Juha Raivio - guitars (2009–2016)
Kai Hahto - drums (2013–2016)
Fredrik Normann - guitars (2013–2016)
Mattias Normann - bass (2014–2016)

On April 18, 2016, singer Aleah Stanbridge died from cancer at age 39. Two days later, Juha wrote on Facebook that the album has been ready to be released for a while and that the plans are still in motion. He's also planning to release Aleah's solo songs in the future. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Trees+Of+Eternity">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
