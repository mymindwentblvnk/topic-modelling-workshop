Macha is an experimental post-rock band from Athens, Georgia comprised of brothers Joshua McKay (main song writer/multi-instrumentalist) and Mischo McKay (drums/percussion), Kai Reidl (multi-instrumentalist), & Wes Martin (multi-instrumentalist& ex-Edie Brickell and the New Bohemians guitarist). Macha's music combines the precision tension-and-release post-punk of Mogwai with the lush, hypnotic grind of My Bloody Valentine, along with bits of new wave and Indonesian Gamelan. They are known for incorporating some of the following instruments into their sets: Javanese zither, Balinese bamboo flute, hammered dulcimer, Hawaiian slide guitar, talempong nipple gongs, Nepalese shawms, vibraphone, standard voice, guitar, and drums, as well as a '70s-era thrift-store organ dubbed "the Fun Machine." 

The band released their self-titled debut album in 1998 for Jetset Records. In 1999 they released See It Another Way (Jetset). They also teamed up with Bedhead a year later for the mini-album Macha Loved Bedhead (Jetset 2000). Four years since their last full-length, the group returned with Forget Tomorrow (Jetset 2004) expanding their sound and venturing further into pop territories. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Macha">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
