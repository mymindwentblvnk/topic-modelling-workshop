Thrash-Metal band from Kerava, Finland formed in 1992 and currently known as Am I Blood. They released their first album "Natural Mutation" as St. Mucus in 1995. Just one month before releasing the debut album, their original singer Pasi Koskinen (Amorphis, Ajattara) left, so they changed their name to Am I Blood.
