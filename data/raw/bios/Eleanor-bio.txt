There are four bands with the name Eleanor.

1. Eleanor is a pop/rock/punk outfit from Queens.

2. A Japanese melancholic, gothic metal band formed in 2005, now under the label Black Listed Records. The band describes their music as "lyrical melody with a heavy guitar sound that will charm your heart."

3. Eleanor pulls the listener into close emotional orbit with metallic drumbeats and melting violin chords. Eleanor's music is experimental yet grounded, blending an original sound with cohesive, accessible melodies. But arresting and stirring harmonies reflect that, behind every toe-tapping note, there is an artist exploring his and our own imperfect humanity. Palpable honesty and fresh lyrics echo this exploration, this struggle. And in the end, the listener can't help feel captured, drawn into the music's agile movement and captured by the language for its reality.

4. Eleanor Academia, who had a dance hit in the 1980s with the Shep Pettibone remix of her song "Adventure".

5. Eleanor was a grindcore band from Gaithersburg, MD from 2004-2007. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Eleanor">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
