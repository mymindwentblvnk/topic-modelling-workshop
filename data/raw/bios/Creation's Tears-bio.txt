Creation's Tears are a Dark Rock, Gothic Metal or Heavy Metal Music band based in the Greater Belfast region of Northern Ireland, with some members based in England. Creation's Tears have been defined by British journalist Malcolm Dome and Swedish producer Jens Bogren as belonging to the Gothic Metal genre. The band themselves are keen to escape categorisation and frontman Brian Eddie Reynolds has been documented in rock music press as saying that Methods To End It All is definitely not a gothic album. Brian Eddie Reynolds has been quoted in several interviews as follows: “I think of Creation’s Tears as music for the emotionally disturbed, the suicidal and those who have been oppressed by the female of the species”.
