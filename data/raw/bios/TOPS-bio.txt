Coming from Montreal, Quebec, TOPS deliver a clever blend of groovy 80s-inspired indie pop and gentle rock. They consist of Jane Penny, David Carriere, Riley Fleck, Jackson Macintosh and Marta Cikojevic. After releasing their debut album Tender Opposites in 2012 and its critically acclaimed follow-up Picture You Staring in 2014 through Arbutus Records (the prominent Montreal label behind Grimes, Sean Nicholas Savage and Braids), their latest release in 2017 – Sugar at the Gate – displays an intriguing mix of sadness and romance that hits deep to their listeners’ emotional core. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/TOPS">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
