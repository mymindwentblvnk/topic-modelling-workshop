Fuzz rock trio Calva Louise have shared some big journeys to get where they are today. On guitar and vocals, Jess Allanic is a native of Venezuela who moved to France in her teens. There she met bassist Alizon Taho with whom she eventually travelled to the UK, where drummer Ben Parker joined the picture. Now based in London, the group routinely rip up venues nationwide with their explosive garage/surf tunes. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Calva+Louise">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
