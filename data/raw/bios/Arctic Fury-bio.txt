Arctic Fury began in 2006, with Alex Mullings, Gaz P, Yom Hardy, Rick Blomfield and Nick Montegriffo beginning a 6 month barrage of York's univeristy and local music scene. Delivering catchy choruses, chugging riffs and thundering rhythm, the Mark II lineup topped 2007 off with a no-holds barred performance at Woodstock 2007 at York University. Having been on hold for a year, Arctic Fury are back in town and will once again be destroying the boards at premier music venues all over York! 

In 2008, the Fury reformed, laying Yorkshire and beyond to waste with more metal than the Pope's chastity belt. We're back, we're bad, we're black, we're mad!
