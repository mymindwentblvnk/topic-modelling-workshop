There are two bands using the name Gorse.

The other is an avant-folk group hailing from Cornwall, England whose debut opus "May The Gorse Be With You" was released on V/Vm Test in 2002 to much critical acclaim.   Their genuine cover quote by Aphex Twin ("this music will make you mad") is perhaps an overstatement, but only just.

One is a stoner/noise rock band, hailing from England, whose debut EP was released in 2009 on Calculon records. They have a new album called Bovine Soul released on I Made this Records. Their sound incorporates heavy repetitive elements from Amphetamine Reptile to Neurosis, the industrial feel of Godflesh and psychedelic guitar washes of Sonic Youth and Boredoms.
