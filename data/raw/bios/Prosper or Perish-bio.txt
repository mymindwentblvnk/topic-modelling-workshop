Prosper or Perish formed in Philadelphia, PA in 2006, released "The Dawning EP" in 2007 and released the "Defiant" LP in 2011. Over the last 2 years they have gone through a few line up changes and recruited a new drummer and bassist, whose powerful and diverse styles of playing have reshaped Defiant. The band is currently writing new music for their next effort and plan to record in early 2014. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Prosper+or+Perish">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
