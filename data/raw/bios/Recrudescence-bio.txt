Recrudescence began in mid-2005 under previous surnames such as "Behind Reflections." The project began with heavy melodic thrash influences from the early 90's, but during their short run, the band dabbled into a variety of styles including early grind and 70's groove. After several basement Ep's, the album 'Tracking the Decline of Human Society' was released in 2008. The band broke up later that year. 

"The locals were the usual fare of wannabe bands with ample squawking, squealing and grunting, however newcomers Recrudescence, who were humorous and self-deprecating with their form of Cephalic Carnage inspired death grind, caught my ear."
