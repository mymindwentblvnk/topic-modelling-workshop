Though the Singers Unlimited have not recorded a new album since 1980's "Easy To Love," their popularity continues unabated. Their fourteen album catalog, recorded for Germany's MPS records and now available as the "Magic Voices" collection, reflects the best of what the human voice is capable. The arrangements that member Gene Puerling wrote for the group were nothing short of a revelation-and the group's use of studio multi-tracking (a burgeoning technology) developed a sound never heard before. The name "Singers Unlimited" is forever inscribed in the annals of vocal jazz, and deservedly so.
Puerling's Singers Unlimited arrangements earned him the reputation as one of the best vocal writers in the world. Members of the renowned jazz-gospel vocal group Take 6 often gives credit to Puerling and the Singers Unlimted as innovators in the a cappella world, claiming that they "went to school" on Puerling's arrangements.
