There is more than one artist named Worms of the Earth:
 
1. Worms of the Earth is the Rhythmic Noise /Dark Ambient project of Dan Barrett. The idea of Worms of the Earth emerged in 2004, though it gestated until 2007 when the first workings came to light. Since then, a critically-acclaimed full length and an EP have been released on Canadian experimental/industrial label Bugs Crawling Out Of People, numerous remixes and compilation appearances sculpted, as well as 50+ shows across the eastern US and Canada alongside acts such as Haujobb, Iszoloscope, Scrap.edx, Terrorfakt, Asche, Mono-Amine, and many more. In 2012 WOTE joins Tympanik Audio.

Worms of the Earth evokes the harsh sounds of ancient technology combined with chthonic dark ambience and eastern mysticism to create aural rituals which explore esoteric knowledge and the pursuit of the ascension of the self.
