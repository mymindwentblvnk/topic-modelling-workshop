A Cricket In Times Square formed in 2000 at University of Maryland’s student radio station WMUC. The fledgling band played a number of shows in the Washington D.C. and Baltimore area, perhaps most memorably at the Black Cat's The Velvet Underground tribute night. The epic versions of "Sister Ray" and "Heroin" they performed having incurred the wrath of the best club in town and many of their fellow performers (and finding little in common with the District's Dischord-centric music scene), the band felt it had little left to accomplish in D.C. (In the band’s defense, the club did know which songs ACITS would be playing.) After completing the recordings that would become this release, ACITS relocated to Seattle in late 2003 and enlisted a new rhythm section in Dino DeJesus (bass) and Dominic Senibaldi (drums). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/A+Cricket+In+Times+Square">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
