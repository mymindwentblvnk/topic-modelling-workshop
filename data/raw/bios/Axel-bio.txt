There are most certainly many Axels.

1.) Latin Pop singer.  From all music guide:
"Born in Rafael Calzada, a small town in the province of Buenos Aires, Argentina, Axel Fernando began playing the piano at an early age, even gaining acceptance into the national conservatory, though he initially ended up deciding he would rather concentrate on more classic scholastic training. This didn't last too long, however; at 17 he realized it was music he truly wanted to pursue, and began practicing and looking for work. Axel got a small gig as a waiter and bar piano player in a soap opera, and when that was done, he went to the tourist spots on the coast to play for the vacationers who thronged there, moving back home when the season was over to plan his next step. His dedication paid off, and soon he was offered a job as pianist for a children's show, eventually being promoted to host, an opportunity he used to display his own original songs. Sony Music Argentina took interest in the young singer and offered him a contract, which he accepted, and in 1999 Axel issued his debut album, La Clave para Conquistarte, followed by Mi Forma de Amor in 2001. Two years later Amo came out, and 2005 saw the release of the by-now heartthrob's fourth record, Hoy."

2.) NYC Rapper whose most famous song is "100 to  1"  Other songs include, "MTV Cribs" and "Ebonics" a version of the song which teaches spanish phrases.
