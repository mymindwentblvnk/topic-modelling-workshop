2 bands, either Neo-folk from Norway or Doomgaze/post apocalyptic stoner from Bergen, Norway.

SOLSTORM (solar storm) is the mindwork of Ognoise, a noise talent from Kopervik on the westcoast of Norway. Emigrating to Bergen with Jaran Hereid and Camilo Beltran from deathmetal act GOLIATHON, they formed the line-up of Solstorm together with Helge Taksdal and drummer ALKOLUST (Hellish Outcast, Byfrost). Concentrating mainly on apocalyptic themes, creating the sound of armageddon and the inevitable end of all things SOLSTORM combine noise with doom and anti-euphoric stoner metal. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Solstorm">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
