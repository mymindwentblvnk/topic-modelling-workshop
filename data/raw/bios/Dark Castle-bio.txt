Dark Castle is an American sludge / doom metal  two-piece band from St. Augustine, Florida, United States formed in 2005.

They first appeared in 2008 with an elaborately packaged self-released demo (Flight of Pegasus) that garned a good deal of favorable attention from the metal press and other bands (including Relapse Records' Minsk).  It is easy to see why this unsigned band turned so many heads, as there are several obvious elements that separate them from their peers.  

They released their first full-length album, Spirited Migration, in 2009.

The original lineup :

Stevie Floyd - guitars, vocal ;
Rob Shaffer - drums, vocal.
