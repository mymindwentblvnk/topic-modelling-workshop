Dexters are Tom Rowlett (vocals), Chris Heggie (guitars, BV’s), Ben Debo (lead guitar, BV’s), Chris Mardon (drums) and Jamie Harris (bass). The band formed in 2011 after growing up together on estates in the rougher part of East London. Their sound is inspired by where they grew up with narrative packed lyrics about how hard life can be with influences including the melodies of The La’s and The Strokes and the sheer punk, visceral aggression of The Clash and The Buzzcocks. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dexters">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
