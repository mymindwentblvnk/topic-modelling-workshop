“terrible, absolutely fucking terrible”
“Worst shit ever.”
“that band teeth gnashers is extremely gay”
“Just listened to crypt-thing, they sold out. “
“Free folk black metal, which is nothing but a lame joke.”
“worst bullshit i’ve experienced all year long. unoriginal. untalented. uninteresting. go back to your shitty punk records. i’m sure the Animal Collective track is being mocked because it’s just sooo last year for them.”
“This band has nothing to do with Bone Awl besides the obvious theft of ideas.”
“not into this at all. pretty much painful to listen to.”
“go away”
“Not worth the time”
“the link doesn’t work… could you try again? i’d be interested in checking this out.”
"I can't say I listen to extremely weird music, but Teeth Gnashers is kind of screwed up music."
