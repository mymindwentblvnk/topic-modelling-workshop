Their first smash hit was "Dickes B": a declaration of love to Berlin. They won two ECHO Awards. With the international versions of "Music Monks" and "Next!", they broke through the borders to the surrounding countries, especially France.
Most of the German songs however, are completely translated into English on some of the international versions of the Albums "Next!" and "Music Monks".
