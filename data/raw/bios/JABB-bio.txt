The preposterous Copenhagen-based outfit JABB is the sound of 3 cocky young men and their sarcastic approach to electronic guitar music - with all pseudo-intellectual experiments set aside.
Half rooted in degenerated pop and arrogant no-wave and half based on the potent beats and imbecile repetition of the club scene, the band tears along soundscapes of wailing guitars, hard-hitting drum machines and booming bass-synth.

JABB is also the name of an Alexandria, VA based rapper with a focus on soulful aspect of hip hop.  Jabb is associated with fellow Alexandria rapper Black Cobain as well as the rapper Mi$tro and producer Jay Cornell (producer for Trouble.)
