The fierce berserker from the Underground 


 


When a band is kept alive for over ten years, despite being overshadowed by other projects, then there must be something to it... 


 


To assume that THE ARTIFICE needed time to mature would be presumptuous. Flo, Mike, Leandro and Christian just had other priorities at the time. Nonetheless a common love for Metal steadily kept bringing the four guys back to the practice space to rehearse for the odd gig. Whether it be in the Reitschule Bern, at the Headbangers Ball Open-Air, or in some rundown venue in the outskirts of the city, THE ARTIFICE were always met with approval and interest. It didn't take long for the band to attract an audience of regulars, while the desire to record and release an album and play more heavy-hitting, modern THRASH METAL gigs grew stronger and stronger. 


 


At last, 2016 sees THE ARTIFICE releasing their self-titled debut record. Eight ruthless songs that each pound into pretty much every moving part of the body. Relentlessly direct, energetic and refusing to be subtle nor timid, these songs shape a raging album that now will be blasted live for the audience. A sore neck is guaranteed! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Artifice">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
