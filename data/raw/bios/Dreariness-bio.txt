There are two bands named Dreariness:

1) Dreariness is a depressive black metal / blackgaze band from Rome, Italy, formed in 2012 as a collaboration between Gris and Torpor (from Misere Nobis), and vocalist Tenebra.
The project was born with the desire to be overwhelmed by the whirlwind of emotions, through the fusion of classic sounds and themes characteristics of depressive black metal, with those of post-black metal / blackgaze. Their debut album “My Mind is too Weak to Forget” was released in January 2013 on Nostalgia Productions.
