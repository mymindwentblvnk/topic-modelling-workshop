Dracena was formed in 1994 in Gothenburg (SWE). At the beginning it consisted of only female members, but after some line-up changes the band ended up with a male drummer in 1998. We have released 3 demos (1997,1999, 2001) and one full length album (2006)

The album ''Infernal Damnation'' was an independent release. recorded the album by Mia Larsson, he all the vocals and played all the instruments except for the drums which was played by Mojjo.
