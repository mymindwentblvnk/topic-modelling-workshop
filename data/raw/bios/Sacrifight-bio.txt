Sacrifight was formed in early 2005 by Simon Vanscheidt (Vocals / Guitar), Stefan Balbasus (Lead Guitar), Marcel Staudinger (Bass) and Sidney Vice (Drums). After their first shows they became one of MÃ¼lheims favorite underground bands and are known by press and people. They created a new, innovative sound out of old and new school rock music. Hard and loud guitars mixed with melodic influences and autobiographic lyrics are their trademark. Their lyrics deal with emotions they had and with a life in this fu**ed up society (they like to call it Black-and-White-society). Right now they are recording their first demo EP. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sacrifight">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
