Mystic Opera is symphonic and melodic dark metal from Finland, with influences by Rhapsody, Dimmu Borgir and King Diamond, also classical composers like Frédéric Chopin and Johann Sebastian Bach. The band's lyrics are based on J.R.R Tolkiens legendaric books Silmarillion and Lord of the Rings.


Mystic Opera was found by keyboardist-composer Anssi Pajuoja in November 2005. Pajuoja, bass player Janne Myllymäki and drummer Janne Honkanen had together power metal band called Arcadian, and Mystic Opera was founded on the ruins of it. Mystic Opera´s original line-up was completed by guitarist Sami Pilve and vocalist Emilia Rantasalo. In February 2006 Juha Arola replaced Janne Honkanen as Mystic Opera's drummer and in May 2006 Mira Honkanen took a place Mystic Opera´s vocals. The band started to record their first promo "Mighty Sauron" during the summer 2006 and it was released end of December. After recording, vocalist Mira Honkanen decided to finnish co-operation. In February 2007 band´s line-up broke complitely because of problems with some members and their attitude in the band.


Band's line-up isn't complete yet, but Mystic Opera has found a new brilliant opera singeress and awesome quitarist, so the drummer and the bass-player are still missing. Mystic Opera is searching high-skilled, fast and sharp drummer who can play their songs well. New songs are in places faster, darker and more complicated than songs before. So it´s good if drummer can play blastbeat.
