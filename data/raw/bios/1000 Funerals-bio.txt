A slow, dark and romantic funeral doom project from Iran. Their first album Portrait of a Dream was released in 2005.
The band officially dissolved in winter 2005. 5 years later, 1000 Funerals continued again in autumn 2010 with "Haamoon" from Unperishable Fall and released the album Butterfly Decadence in 2011.
1000 Funerals split up again in summer 2011... forever.
