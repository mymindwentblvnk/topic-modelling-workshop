Paysage d'Hiver is a one-man atmospheric black metal / dark ambient band from Berne, Switzerland, formed in 1997. The sole member is Tobias Möckl aka "Wintherr", also of Darkspace. The name Paysage d'Hiver is French and translates to "Winter Landscape"; the songs' lyrics talk overall about winter, darkness, and out of body experiences. Wintherr has cited the Burzum albums "Hvis lyset tar oss" and "Filosofem", among others, as an inspiration for his music. All of Paysage d'Hiver's own material are released through Kunstall Produktionen, a label Wintherr runs together with Nimosh of the band Nordlicht.

All demos after "Steineiche" CD-R have first been released on tape, but have been or will be re-released on LP/DLP - "Winterkälte" even on 3LP - as well as A5 digibook CD formats.
