Another band doomed to obscurity due to their signing with JL America in the early 90s, Puerto Ricans Organic Infest specialized a particularly feral brand of percussive death metal somewhat comparable to Decide's second album and early Suffocation. They released "Penitence" in 1993 after making a name for themselves on the demo circuit. Its belated follow-up was issued ten years later. They are still active today, having changed their name to Organic. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Organic+Infest">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
