Horde of Hel was named in 2000, by 4 members who wanted to do the most hateful art this scene ever seen....

HORDE OF HEL is a product of total madness and inhumanity, we have no respect for the weak of mind, the prophets of any religion. HORDE OF HEL support and hail the tyrants of the past and now! Massmurders and unhuman beings we find joyful and strong! Suicide and selfdestroying is the choice we..ll bring to get to you all!! Depression and self denying we..ll sympathize with!! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Horde+of+Hel">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
