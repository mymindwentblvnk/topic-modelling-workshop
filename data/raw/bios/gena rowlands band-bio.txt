If you were to look up the bios of the Gena Rowlands Band players, you would encounter names like Fugazi, Tsunami, Dismemberment Plan, et al. The Gena Rowlands Band are people who were reared in that Washington D.C post-punk community. Members have toured and recorded with those names and more. But the big deal here is that the GRB leaves those names and sounds behind.

What you hear is utterly different. Strings stolen from a b&w movie score—or New York’s experimental scene. The skitter of jazz brushes. A voice that draws more power from a whisper, a wry lyric, or a soulful falsetto—than a scream.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gena+Rowlands+Band">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
