From dreamy soundscapes to slacker fuzz pop, Suburban Haze weaves together an ethereal experience from just a quartet. Formed in late 2012 from members of Tired Minds and All in a Year, Suburban Haze recorded an EP within a few months which saw them gain support slots for bands like Gatherer (NZ), Safe Hands, Oslow, The Sinking Teeth, Maids, Valjean and FGWMWS just to name a few. The dynamic sound has ensured the band has never been out of place, no matter the show.
Combining DIY punk ethos with the sounds of alternative rock, shoegaze and indie they’ve toured the east coast and impressed crowds with their passionate stage performances. Their debut EP has made the rounds on Triple J Unearthed, appearing on Rosie Beaton’s program and reaching Top 10 position in the unearthed charts.

Suburban Haze has just finished recording a full length album which is slated for release in September with singles being released by Matt O’Connor’s A&R Department. The band continues to tour around the east coast and are constantly writing new songs and looking to the future as a band.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Suburban+Haze">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
