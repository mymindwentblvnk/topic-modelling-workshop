The design of the Hebrew letter samech is a circle, and represents infinity, because it has no beginning or end. In Kabbalah the samech represents the infinite power of the Ein Sof, G-dâ€™s infinite light. Another brilliant Jewish music group out of Poland, Samech is a string trio with percussion that makes music with a sweeping melodic edge and a strong rhythmic drive. Picking up where Davka and the Masada String Trio left off, they combine a variety of world music traditions into a fresh and exciting new music. Charming and endlessly listenable, this is a new chamber music for the 21st century. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Samech">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
