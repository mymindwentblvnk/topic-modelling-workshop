Fuck Your Shadow From Behind was founded in Würzburg in August 2007 by Tobias Jaschinsky, Adrian Schler, Nikita Kamprad, Sven Lutz and Benedikt Willnecker. After a short time Fabian Klinker joined the band as a drummer and the first demo was recorded. Their first show was played in December 2007 as local support for War From A Harlots Mouth and Calléjon and after having played further gigs the band's name grew bigger in Germany's metal scene. The greatest success until now was earned at the Summer-Breeze Open Air in August 2008, when the Newcomer Contest was won against five other bands and the festival was opened the next day on the mainstage in front of thousand of visitors. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fuck+Your+Shadow+From+Behind">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
