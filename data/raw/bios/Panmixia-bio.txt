Invisible Friend is a 5-year collaboration between Mike Jedlicka and Geoff Richards (Electric Blanket).  They began by sending Reason files back filled with live instruments (sitar, bass, guitar, piano, tabla) and electronics.  Walter Maenhout helped out with drums on track 1 and Lisa Marsicek played the violin on track 7. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Panmixia">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
