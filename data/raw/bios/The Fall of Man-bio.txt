The Fall of Man is two bands



the first were born in a pretty casual way,on a summer night in a conversation between two friends, Che (vocals) and Joao (guitar),after some beers and talking about a previous project that they had together along with Tim (guitar),just said to each other..".why the fuck dont we form a band?".And so it was,two phone calls were made and after a week, Mito (bass) and Pedro (drums) showed up and they started jamming together.Tim who had plans to go to Spain at the time, didnt go after all, so he immediately joined the boys who wanted him in the band since day one. After a few weeks the guys already had a couple of songs and it became clear that there was a special vibe between the five. A vicious mix that goes from thrash to deathcore with no boundaries whatsoever.


The second is what come up on the player. from NH.
