Not to be confused with John McLaughlin's band with the same name.

4TH DIMENSION was founded in 2005 by singer Andrea Bicego and keyboard player Talete Fusaro. Since the beginning the band focused on a specific style, symphonic power metal, following the steps of metal gods such as Stratovarius, Sonata Arctica, Rhapsody of Fire & more. During the first year the current line-up was built, comprising also drummer Massimiliano Forte, guitarist Michele Segafredo and bass player Stefano Pinaroli.

In 2008 4TH DIMENSION started writing original songs, the first of which, “THE SUN IN MY LIFE” was recorded in early 2009 and appeared on a compilation called “TOTAL INVASION vol. 3”, (which was distributed with a run of 20.000 copies in Italy and Germany during summer festivals such as GODS OF METAL & WACKEN OPEN AIR).

The songwriting process was completed at the end of 2009 and, soon after, ALESSIO LUCATTI (keyboard player of italian metal heroes Vision Divine) took an interest in 4TH DIMENSION's sound, consequently deciding to produce the band's debut album, which was finally recorded between may/august 2010 in Pisa. The album was also engineered and mixed by Alessio Lucatti and mastered by Luigi Stefanini at New Sin Studio (Labyrinth, Vision Divine, White Skull and more) in Treviso. It also features FABIO LIONE (Rhapsody of Fire's impressive lead singer) as a very special guest.

In early 2011 4TH DIMENSION signed for italian label CRASH & BURN RECORDS, which is about to release the band's album, “THE WHITE PATH TO REBIRTH”.

February 24th, 2011 is going to mark the beginning of new fantastic experience for the band, with 4TH DIMENSION supporting SONATA ARCTICA and LABYRINTH in 11 dates of the forthcoming European Tour...
