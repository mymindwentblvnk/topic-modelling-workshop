There is more than one artist with this name:
1) Wasted was formed in the fall of 1996 in Joensuu, Finland. They play raw old school punk rock, something that only few Finnish bands played back in '96. The band has released a couple of albums, the latest - Here Comes The Darkness - in year 2013.
2) Over the last 3 years Wasted (from Amsterdam) has slowly spread like a fire in the underbrush of the European live circuit. With a sound that is founded on the personal inspirations from the bands members such as Tom Petty, Aerosmith, Mot√∂rhead and the Dixie Chicks and many others Wasted creates their own unique blend. With pre-production work on Wasted's debut album in full effect, Frank Suicide (lead guitar), Alex BL. (main Vox & Bass) and Roland Ritchie (Drums) are stepping into the limelight.
3) Danish heavy metal band from 1980. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wasted">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
