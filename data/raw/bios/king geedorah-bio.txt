King Geedorah was an MF DOOM side project. A concept album drawing on samples from sources as obvious as Godzilla movies (specifically "Kaijū Daisensō," titled "Invasion of Astro-Monster" for English release) to those as obscure as the closing theme from the original  Gatchaman  anime. Other notable samples include one from Just-Ice's song "This Girl Is A Slut" which appears in the song "The Fine Print" and the original Dark Shadows theme song (which appears in two tracks), to say nothing of an inspired use of a Hall & Oates song opening, "Take Me to Your Leader" offers a diverse and yet strikingly coherent pastiche of cultural artifacts.  

Of course, DOOM himself raps but very little on this disc, but the "rap-by-committee" approach works so well that you'll hardly notice the variety of styles, flows, and voices. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/King+Geedorah">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
