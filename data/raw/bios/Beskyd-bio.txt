Beskyd - Ukrainian Atmospheric Black Metal.

Formed in 2012 by guitarist/vocalist Stanislav K. ("Snig") and drummer Andriy Z. ("Las Wiatr"). Inspired by such bands as NegurÄƒ Bunget, Drudkh, Lustre - Snig desired to express his own musical ideas and views in the genre. During the work on the material, he invited his friend guitarist Oleksandr B. ("Dammond"), who fully shared his thoughts on the music and how things should be done. It was also agreed to have no bassist, just 2 guitars.

The first demo "By the Paths of Native Land" was released online in 2014. Before the recording even started, Snig stated that he has to leave the band due to personal reasons. But before that, he recorded all vocal parts for the demo. After 2014 release, new music for Beskyd is primarily composed by Dammond.

In 2015 the band already had enough material for a new release. And at the end of 2015, their first full-length album "Never to Return" has been released (CD+digital). Despite the desire to preserve the original style, there're noticeable differences in music compared to the demo album. Obviously, the departure of Snig, the former composer, had its impact. The band still kept most of the initial principles, such as minimalism in music and no-bass-guitar (first 2 releases were recorded with a bass synth).

In 2015 bassist Onedal joined the band. With renewed vigour, the band works on a new music.
The material for the next full-length was nearly complete in 2017, when the band released online "Voice of Battle" - a single from the upcoming album. However, over the next 3 years, the trio was unable to come to a common vision of music.
In 2020 it was decided to part ways, leaving Beskyd as Dammond's one-man-band. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/beskyd">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
