Hardingrock is a collaboration between the musicians Star of Ash (Heidi Solberg Tveitan), Ihsahn (Vegard Tveitan) and Grimen (Knut Buen).

The album Grimen presents folk tunes on the Norwegian national instrument, Harding fiddle, text and melodies based on Norwegian mythical tradition, arranged and recomposed in modern form with influences from heavy metal and classically inspired electronica. This is an experimental project where folk tunes are thematically broken down and expressed in a new rhythmic and harmonic form with guitars, piano, keyboards, percussion, recitation and song.
