Formed in 2001 under the name Dark Monarchy, Strigoi Vii is a black metal band hailing from Ohio, performing regularly in the Midwest USA. Over the years, the band has revolved around founding members  VPR MRBRZR (guitars, vocals, synths) and Nekross,(guitars, vocals, effects) with contributions from various musicians from the Cincinnati/Dayton area. The band is now rounded out by Dan (Succorbenoth, Lilin) on drums and Clint (Beer Can Graveyard) on bass guitar.
While under the banner of Dark Monarchy, the project was a straightforward black metal affair borrowing elements from BM scene godfathers, and USBM contemporaries. With the name change in 2009, the band have since eschewed much of the aural/visual elements owed to black metal, hinting to a wider range of influences as evidenced live and on the upcoming vinyl releases. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Strigoi+Vii">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
