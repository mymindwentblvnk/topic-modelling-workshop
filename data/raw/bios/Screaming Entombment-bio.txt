Screaming Entombment was formed in October 2009 by vocalist Dusty Hansen and guitarist Eric Kwiatkowski. In November 2009 they recruited bassist Taylor Dahlen and drummer Jake Hart. With the line-up complete they steadily began writing material and played their first show six months later. They since have played multiple shows and music festivals with great response due to their high energy stage show. In October 2010 they began work on their first EP "Become the Suffering". The album was self released in January 2011. Multiple Festival dates and concert gigs later, the band shows no sign of slowing down!  Fast forward to August 2012 with the release of the new full length album "Malice Of Your Maker".  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Screaming+Entombment">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
