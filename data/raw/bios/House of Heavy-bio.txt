BIO:
Henrik Lundberg and Mattias Wellhag
(also in Preserved in Grace) met during a studio session outside of Skövde, Sweden, some fifteen years ago. H. playing bass in Masquerade at the time, and M. singing in some crap band that were going absolutely nowhere, and pretty slow at that...

The two became really good friends when H. later joined that very same crap band... Ever since, they' ve talked about how cool it would be to write some music together, just for the fun of it.

Many hours were spent drinking beer and headbanging to 80:s hard rock, fantasising about putting a band together.
Nothing happened, of course, until Masquerade more or less fell asleep and M:s crap band disappeared into oblivion about ten years later...

It was about that time M. bought himself a Gibson Explorer (the coolest guitar known to man, if you ask M...) and some cheap studio equipment and started experimenting away, not really knowing what the hell he was doing...

At the same time H was rockin´ out like a hard man in his living room creating interesting noise with his Gibson Les Paul arsenal (the coolest guitars known to man, if you ask H…).
Things suddenly started sounding pretty awesome and the result of that, is: House Of Heavy.

After two years of writing and recording together in M:s livingroom (faster than the speed of light!) the self titled debut album is, belive it or not, finished!

In September -08 HoH signs a digital distribution deal with Metal Blade and also manage to flirt their way into a world wide deal by signing on for the mighty Spiritual Beast Records in October -08, for a physical release. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/House+Of+Heavy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
