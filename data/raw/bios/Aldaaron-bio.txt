Spirits from the ancient times, gathered under the banner of Aldaaron the Lord of Trees and Warrior of the Valars, the Aldaars came to light in the year 2004 in the obscure forests of the Alps on the initiative of Ioldar.

Drawing its inspiration from an epic vision of Nature, the music of Aldaaron is the union of furious epic melodies with atmospheric parts.

The lyrics express feelings of solitude, sadness, revenge, domination, as one could feel standing alone on a moutaintop or walking by night in a cabalistic winter forest, feeling the spirit of the age-old woods and the purity of the eternally snow-covered summits.
