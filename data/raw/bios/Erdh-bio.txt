ERDH came to life in 2010 after Nicolas Pingnelain (composer, instruments) met WORMFOOD leader Emmanuel LÃ©vy (vocals, lyrics). ERDH's debut album "Resilient" (mixed/mastered by Jens Bogren at Fascination Street Studios) is now available in stores.

Erdh's debut album "Resilient" is a series of seven tracks which read as so many mazes, structure shifts, meandering paths, ebbing and flowing. Those expressive, straightforward metallic core grids are suffused with experimental electro abstraction. The final scene mingles digital effects, overdrive and a sepulchral voice. The oil is cold, it spreads methodically and its borders are unpredictable. Forget about univocality: in a dark introspective space, the sound is robot-like and mouths a threat, the origin and outcome of which remain mysterious. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Erdh">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
