"Nott began with a wave of thunderous tales of the depths and the unknown, 3 EPs in total. Boiling up from the chasms of isolation, the project then relocated to Seattle to advance the endeavor. It was in the spring of 2018 that the first full length arrived, a narrative of anguish, sorrow, and unfettered hatred.

The release of The Wretched Sounds signaled a new era for Nott, and the project evolved from the studio to a live force. This new breadth and dimension broadened the dissonant atmosphere and suffocating gravity of Nottâ€™s sound, swallowing all in its path." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nott">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
