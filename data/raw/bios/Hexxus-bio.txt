2. HEXXUS is a heavy/black/death metal band from Lule√•, Sweden, formed by Mikael Abrahamsson (vocals and bass) and Jens Josefsson (guitars) in November 2000. To complete the 

line-up Jonas Mejfeldt (guitars) and Rickard Abrahamsson (drums) was recruited. HEXXUS recorded two unreleased demos as a heavy metal band influenced by Irish and Swedish 

folk music between the year 2000 and 2005. Due to the lack of finding a permanent singer things were moving slowly and HEXXUS was put on ice. Refusing to accept defeat, 

HEXXUS was resurrected in 2007. Returning to their roots in black/death metal, Micke takes over the vocals and HEXXUS starts to write new kick ass material. By combining the 

rhythmic riffs and song structures of heavy metal, with the power and aggression of black/death metal a demo was recorded and released in the summer of 2007. HEXXUS is 

currently hard at work playing live and writing new material.

The HEXXUS line-up is:
Mikael Abrahamsson - Vocals & Bass
Jens Josefsson - Guitars
