Tropical Trash are a Louisville-based noise rock combo founded by singer/guitarist Jim Marlowe. The band has had a somewhat flexible lineup during its existence, notably as a trio featuring bassist Ryan Davis of State Champion and drummer Jeff Komara of Sapat and Alcohol Party. 

As a trio, the group released the 2015 full length UFO Rot on Load Records in the U.S. and on Riot Season in the EU. The live release LIVE AT THE FILLMORE ETC was recorded while touring the U.S. West Coast in support of Slint. UFO Rot was followed by the 2017 EP, A Dent In The Forever Can, and the quasi-full-length 2017 EP, Decisions' Empty Nest.

The group returned in January 2019 with Southern Indiana Drone Footage, adding drummer Sal Cassato and Dan Davis on tenor guitar, clarinet, and synth, alongside Marlowe and Ryan Davis.   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tropical+Trash">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
