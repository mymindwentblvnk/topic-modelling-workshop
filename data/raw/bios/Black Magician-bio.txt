Black Magician formed through mutual appreciation of 70s prog, eerie folklore, and truly good ale.  While they confess to being just as influenced by the late 60s British folk scene as by the old guard of heavy metal and doom metal, Black Magician’s ideology is firmly rooted in the sinister. The brooding landscape of Arthur Machen and haunted countryside of M.R. James is where they reside most contentedly.

Black Magician attempt to distance themselves from the current trend for pseudo-occult rehashed doom posturing and clichéd horror film imagery, trying to be much more sincere, based on their genuine fascination with the darker side of British history. With heavy riffs, swirling Hammond organ, and dark acoustic passages, Black Magician invoke a grim incantation, an ode to anti-urbanism, and a very English darkness. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Black+Magician">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
