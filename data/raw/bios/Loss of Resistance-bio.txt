Loss Of Resistance is an officially by David Lehnart (drums) and Eric Zeidler (vocals) in 2004 founded Metal Band from Bad Kreuznach, Germany.
The band name comes from a term of the epidural anesthesia.
The band members themselves describe their style of music as "gut violin" as it was impossible for them to objectively define on one of the genres in the murky soup of metal styles and they operate in their songs in various stylistic devices.

After several cast changes and a new beginning, the lineup remained stable till Joel and Marc left the band in november 2009. In this month, the band released their first album "Firm".
