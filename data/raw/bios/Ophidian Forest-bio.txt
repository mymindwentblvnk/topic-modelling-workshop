OPHIDIAN FOREST are a multi-national black metal collaboration focusing on chaotic pagan black metal. They live thousands of miles away from each other, but this doesn't prevent them from creating their dark sonic art. They simply exchange and combine their individual recordings, not bothered by the fact none have ever met each other in person.
Black metal has no boundaries and is created all over the world and Ophidian Forest are the living proof of that. Guitarist/bassist Zaragil lives in Croatia, drummer Otrebor lives in San Francisco and vocalist/keyboardist/lyrics writer Amalgamoth is from the Netherlands. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ophidian+Forest">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
