2. Bucky are a rock 'n' roll duo with more wit, charm and energy than a skipful of squirrels, and a self-deprecating demeanour that makes it all look easy. While they're heavily influenced by the early '60s America of Chuck Berry, Elvis Presley and Beatlemania, they're no mere revivalists. With songs about the library, the swimming pool, dogs, horses and cars, they display a gentle, down-to-earth sense of humour that's all British. 
Bucky are Simon (guitar and vocals) and Joff (drums and vocals). 

3. A Philadelphia rapper associated with the New York group D-Block.

4. Acid techno producer from Flanders, Belgium.
