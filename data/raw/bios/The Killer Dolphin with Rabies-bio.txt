These Rabid Dolphin boys hail from Madison, WI. With their crazy guitar work and spazzy drums reminiscent of such heavyweights as Dillinger Escape Plan, these noises will hit you in the face like a zombie squirrel being shot from a potato gun. You won't know what hit you and when you think you might have the the slightest hint of an idea what might had occurred they switch it up to a more melodic jazzy sound thus confusing the fuck out of your tired and withered brain that enjoys a little too much Nickelback on the radio.
There shall be much to look forward to in these guy's future, that is if the can survive all constant line up changes. So don't be surprised if you found out you were once in this band. 
Just beware. Although there is no physical evidence of them having rabies or actually killing anyone it's best be wary. Keep in mind that they very well might be weredolpins. Sure you're laughing now but when one of them sneaks into your pool and then kills the fuck out of/rabifys your brains during that post-midnight skinny dip shit won't be so funny, will it? <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Killer+Dolphin+With+Rabies">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
