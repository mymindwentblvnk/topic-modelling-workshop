Los Angeles-based singer/songwriter Naomi Wild got her start as featured vocalist on a handful of electronic pop hits before making her solo debut in 2017. With R&B, dance, and hip-hop influences, Wild began songwriting in college, reaching out to other songwriters and producers over the Internet with vocals recorded on her smartphone. In 2016, she caught the attention of Tim Legend, who recruited her for his song "Hope." Electronic duo ODESZA were the next artists to hear her airy vocals. Upon hearing a sample of her voice, they wrote a song around it. That track, "Higher Ground," arrived in the summer of 2017. Weeks later, Wild released her debut solo single, the trap-influenced "Lessons," produced by Bizness Boi. In 2019 she was featured on the Machine Gun Kelly track "Glass House". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/NAOMI+WILD">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
