From Syracuse, NY, Engineer is compromised of three brothers and a brutal dude behind the drum kit. For those unfamiliar with the group, they play an intelligent and extremely loud blend of sludgy-hardcore and noisey, experimental rock that call influences from the likes of Knut, Breach, Anodyne and the Amphetamine-Reptile back catalogue (i.e. Helmet, Unsane, The Melvins) while maintaining a sound that is distinct, original and very much their own. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Engineer">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
