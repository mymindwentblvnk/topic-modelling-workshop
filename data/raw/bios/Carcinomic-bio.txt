"Carcinomic" refers to anything pertaining to cancer. It's more frequently used in the context of "carcinomic metastasis", a state involving the movement (metastasis) of cancerous cells from a central malignant tumor, using our body's own natural highways. This project started out as a simple exploration of various styles of death metal using biological concepts for lyrical content, but it has evolved into something far more focused and powerful, hopefully. So I hope you enjoy this work. There is more to come in the new album, "Opus: Human Discordia", a multi-part concept album about scientific relationships with our surroundings, ideals versus reality, and what's to come of mankind.
