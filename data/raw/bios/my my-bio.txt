My My are hard to grasp. Sometimes they perform as a threesome, sometimes alone. Often they DJ as a team, sometimes they follow each other. You can think of My My both as a loose entity and a firm collective. It interlocks wonderfully, not only on their records, but also when they are performing live. A DJ set by Carsten Klemann introduces the night and carefully switches over to Lee Jones and Nick Hoppner doing their live set, which in turn is followed by Nick and Carsten DJing for hours and hours on end. It all intertwines effortlessly and one needs to have a close look in order to really know who is fiddling with what knob.

My My have been turning heads and gaining a very respectable following over the last year or so with a series of well received EPs, most recently on Will Saul and Sideshow's new label Aus Music with the 'Butterflies & Zebras EP'. Their production work and live shows have both been praised for their versatility and uniqueness, so it comes as little suprise that on the heels of their first few EPs, they are soon to deliver their debut album 'Songs For The Gentle' on Playhouse.
