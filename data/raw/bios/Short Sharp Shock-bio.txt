Short Sharp Shock (also known as SSS) are a crossover thrash band from Liverpool, England. They are signed to the music label Earache Records.

The band released a six track demo in May 2005, a four track EP the next year and their debut album Short Sharp Shock soon thereafter. Their label at the time was Thrashgig / Dead & Gone Records. Their switch to Earache Records meant the album was re-issued in early 2007 with bonus tracks. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Short+Sharp+Shock">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
