Formed in December of 2011 under the name Malignant Abomination, the project was meant to be a novelty band between guitarist, Will and a close friend. It quickly became more serious changing the name to Hypoxic, and becoming Will's solo project. Two tracks were recorded before changing the name one last time to Swine Overlord and recruiting Devin as vocalist and drummer. SO quickly began writing a unique and punishing blend of slamming brutal death metal, combining Devin's guttural vocals with skull-smashingly heavy instrumentation. In August of 2012 SO was played on heavy metal online radio station Brutal Existence Radio, giving them their first exposure and giving them the attention they needed to establish a fan base. SO's Demo 2012 was released in the early Fall, containing 3 tracks. On Halloween of 2012, they then released their first EP, Anthologies of Abomination, which contained the 3 demo tracks, as well as 2 new songs. 

Since the release of their EP they have quickly been climbing the through the ranks of the underground brutal death metal scene, establishing a name for themselves. Working together with bands such as Gutfucked, Habitual Defilement, and Goemagot, the duo has become a strong force in the new brutal death metal scene. 

In March of 2013 the band signed to Gore House Productions, which will re-release their EP, and will also put out their debut album, Parables of Umbral Transcendence. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Swine+Overlord">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
