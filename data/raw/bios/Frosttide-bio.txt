Joni Snoro decided to form a folk metal band in autumn 2009. He asked Joonas Nislin to play drums. The band also got a guitarist and bassist. He himself played guitar and sang. It was harder to find a keyboard player. In the end the guitarist and bassist left for their own projects. Juho Patinen joined the band as the guitarist around Christmas 2009. For a while they practiced Joni's songs with two guitars and drums, until the band found a keyboard player, Lise Richardson in the beginning of 2010. The band entered the Toukofest band competition around this time. They were looking for a bassist, and the previous guitarist and bassist filled in for a while, until the first official bassist entered the band in spring 2010. The band was now complete. The first show was at Toukofest 2010, and the band made the shared second place in the band competition. 
The band released their first EP Dawn Of Frost at the end of summer 2010. 
In the winter 2010 the band came to the mutual decision to part ways with the bassist of that time and switched temporarily to another, who didn't stay in the band for long.
Currently Frosttide have no official bassist, but two gig-bassists instead.
