K U O K O is the alter ego of multimedia artist Jasmina Quach, mainly committed to writing electronic music by singing, recording and composing songs at home using the computer and electronic music devices as well as acoustic instruments such as the guitar. Always intending to give her voice as much room as possible she enjoys beatprogramming as well as drum synthesis, reversed guitar effects, layered synth melodies and arpeggios to create a dreamy atmosphere in her songs. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kuoko">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
