Hanni-Mari Autere (b. 1969)

My career as a folk musician dates back to my upper secondary art school days in Savonlinna. Before that I had studied classical and pop music and played and sang in several school bands and orchestras. Different genres of music have always interested me although folk music became the dearest. I took my M.A. at the Folk Music Department of the Sibelius Academy in 1999.

My degree comprised studies with my first instrument, the violin, but I also studied accordion, woodwinds and folk singing. I have also studied Irish and Swedish folk singing, in addition to Cuban percussion instruments.
