Eithel Fuin (pron: ay-tell foo-in; elvish words for “Source of Darkness”) is a melodic extreme metal act with strong black metal influences. Born in the 1st half of 2005 in Modena (Italy), the band is formed by Aimvhar V. (vocals and drum programming), Shade (keys and drum programming), Seifer (guitars) and Helvete (bass). Several changes happened during months: due to this problem, we use a drum machine instead of real drumkit, waiting to find the right person to play with us. We have recorded a “Rehearsal 2005” Demo, only for us just to test how recording runs, and then we started the real work of recording with our selfproduced mcd, entitled “Source of Darkness”. At the moment, we are organizing some live gigs in northern Italy to promote our work.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Eithel+Fuin">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
