Founded: 2012
Location: North East, UK
Genre: Technical Death Metal/Slam/Deathcore



Hailing from the extreme music melting pot that is the North East of England, Osiah transcends the deathcore label with what could possibly be the most torturous barrage of filth the UK has produced in recent years. Crushingly intense breakdowns and deathly chops tread a familiar path, but jarringly detuned guitars, unpredictable tempo changes and vocals that range from wide-ranging pitched screams to commanding guttural bowel openers, add an extra evil to the sound that cannot be put in words.


Osiah Released their latest full-length album ‘Terror Firma’ in June 2016 via Siege Music. The album gained praises from Metal Hammer Magazine, Bloody-disgusting and many other prestigious publications, cementing the band as the hottest and heaviest band on the UK deathcore scene.
