ColdSpell comes from the land of the Ice and snow up in the north of Sweden in the iron ore miners town Kiruna. The band had Its beginning in 2005 and the songs have been waiting to come alive and see the light of the day with this 5 piece hard rockin band. The songs of ColdSpell is a mixture of everything we grew up with and the influences comes from the groove of the seventies to the choruses and melodies from the eighties and from the raw and naked touch from the nineties to the fantastic bands and productions of the new millennium. The members of ColdSpell has lots of years playin together and in other bands over the last decades but our main focus now is the hardrock that ColdSpell creates and delivers. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Coldspell">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
