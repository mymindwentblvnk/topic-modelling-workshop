Abysmal Torment is a deathgrind/brutal death metal band from Malta. They were formerly known as Molested, the band was formed in 2004 by Nick Farrugia (vocals), Gordon Formosa (vocals), David Depasquale (guitars, Canniria), Gan Pawl Bartolo (guitars), Tim Briffa (bass)  and Wayne Vella (drums). The band plays brutal death metal with hints of guttural low vocals, high screams, furious blasting and slamming riffs. They are often described as being like Devourment, Beheaded and Guttural Secrete.

After a few line up changes the band hit the stage with Gan leaving the band. The band released their debut EP "Incised Wound Suicide" which took the heaviest sounding influences from Devourment and Wormed to make a very pleasing MCD for fans and spur awesome reviews.

They then were picked up by Brutal Bands unleashing their debut full length album "Epoch Of Methodic Carnage" in 2006, which continued in faith of most brutal death artists and putting in various other influences including hardcore into their brutal sound.

However, the band in 2007 year and a fall in them cancelling tours to promote this debut album and it wasn't until early 2007 they started to tour. They toured with Sanatorium in late 2006 which continued with the Ludwigshafen Deathfest, Slovak Deathfest and Luzern Deathfest with such bands as Craniotomy, Disembowel and Amagortis in 2007. Soon afterwards they were a headliner in dutch Drachten Deathfest including Septycal Gorge and Suffocate Bastard.
