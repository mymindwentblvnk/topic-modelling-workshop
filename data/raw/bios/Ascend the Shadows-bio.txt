Ascend The Shadows was a metal band out of New Haven, CT. They were a prominent force in the local scene from 2008-2010. The band was formed in the summer of 2007 by brothers, Rob (Guitars, and lead vocals) and Tyler (drums) Martinez, along with their good friend Kenny Huelsman (Lead guitar). The band recorded a 6 song demo and then began playing local venues such as Toad's Place, The Space, and the ATC. They released a more refined EP in 2008, which received airplay on the states premier rock station, The Rock 106.9 WCCC. Although the future of the band looked promising, lineup changes lead to an early demise of the band, only three years into its existence. Members throughout the tenure included: Kenny's brother Cody Huelsman (bass), a long lasting member Dylan Champion (bass/guitar), Anthony Astacio (Lead Vocals), Alec Hall (Lead Vocals), and Brandon Rush (bass). Kenny decided to pursue another musical avenue in late 2009 and formed his own band alongside his brother Cody. They are known as, As Everything Ends and are making their name known in the metal scene to this day. Once Kenny left, ATS pushed on for awhile, with Rob and Tyler putting all they had into doing what they loved to do, after enduring all the lineup changes, before disbanding in the summer of 2010.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ascend+the+Shadows">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
