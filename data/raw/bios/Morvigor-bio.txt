Black/death Metal Band from The Netherlands

Guitar: Stefan Van Delft
Guitar: Sytze Andringa
Bass: Evio Paauw
Percussion: Brendan Duffy

Inspired by an extensive list of bands, ranging from Mayhem to Pink Floyd and from Morbid Angel to Joy Division, Morvigor plays their own take on expressive Black/Death Metal. Psychedelic clean parts are followed by dirty punk riffs and finished by melancholic climaxes. Euforic and down-hearted. Experimental and conservative. Uplifting and enthralling. Morvigor walks the beaten path jumps into the dark from time to time.
