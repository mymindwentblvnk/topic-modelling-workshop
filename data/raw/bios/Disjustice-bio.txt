Sarcastic antonym made up for an electro joke. DISJUSTICE, obviously a ironic name forward the French duet, is, as the original, a duet formed at the end of 2007 on Mexico City, by Arturo Vega and Bernando Montaño, and it's nothing but a harsh blink of sarcastic beats and awkward humor.

The self called: “Mexican trendyasfuck electro idm disco zombie phychobilly country post punk and reggeaton duet and also is the contra part of French electro pussy fuckers JUSTICE”.

They call them selves The DISJUSTICE. Like if that broken antonym will be the answer. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/DISJUSTICE">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
