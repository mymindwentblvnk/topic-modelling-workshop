A Heavy/Power/Epic Metal band from Cyprus originally formed in 2005 under the name ABLAZE. Since then they played several gigs. At a certain point the band decided to change it’s name to HARDRAW and they began to present their own material. In addition to that, in order to promote their songs played a lot of gigs with guest vocalists from time to time. HARDRAW along with R.U.S.T.(another Cypriot band) organise an annual heavy metal festival “POWER OF THE NIGHT FESTIVAL”. The new material and the great will, helped the band to compose some new songs. These songs along with the oldest ones, represent the true SOUND of HARDRAW! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hardraw">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
