KONTRUST are touring together in the current formation since 2005. The band released their first Longplayer "we!come home" and the single/videoclip "phono sapiens"  in the same year. With this first output KONTRUST evolved to a big player in the Austrian music scene already and gave an impressive amount of concerts in Europe. The sextett quickly became a regular guest in clubs all over the continent and played at festivals with international reputation.

In 2010 the new album "Time To Tango" and the single "Bomba" mark a big breakthrough including top-chartpositions in the Netherlands. The latest release became a popular hit on the internet and received massive airplay on TV and radio. KONTRUST owes this success not only to the strong feedback in the international musicpress but also to a constantly growing international fanbase. In the same year KONTRUST was awarded with the Amadeus Austrian Music Award.

The band always breaks new ground with inventive concepts: with remarkable ideas, an uncompromising liveshow and a powerful style KONTRUST will continue to amaze old and new fans in the future. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kontrust">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
