Having started their musical career in Detroit, Kill Memory Crash began performing at raves and warehouse parties in the mid-to-late 90's, slowly translating their leftfield influences into their own cryptic language. Now based out of Chicago, Alex SanFa√ßon (electronics), Adam Sieczka (vocals), and Gabriel Palomo (percussion) continue to voyage deeper into the conscience of the international audience via their acclaimed label Ghostly International. 

The year 2005 saw the release of their first full length effort entitled American Automatic, the follow up to the 2003 EP When the Blood Turns Black. Their latest effort, the Of Fire EP, has proved once again that Kill Memory Crash continue to push the musical boundaries that have defined it.
