Melodic. Symphonic. Progressive. Technical. Epic. Metal.

These have all been used to describe Whisper from Heaven's sound. Amulyn's angelic voice resonates over the dual lead / rhythm guitars wielded by Derek Corzine and Hunter Routh. Darren Overcash carves his own niche in the sound with bass lines that carry each song. With progressive drum styles and heavy atmospheric & symphonic elements, the music is rich and full of emotion, enveloping the listener into a wall of sound with lyrics that reflect the band's faith in Jesus Christ. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Whisper+from+Heaven">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
