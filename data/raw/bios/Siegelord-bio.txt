After years of silence and slumber, something stirs. Darkness looms over worlds untold as the fetus of a savage new god kicks. Pantheons crumble and the faithful weep as the cosmos gives birth to a new dark conqueror. 
Four brothers, black of armor and void of soul, roar in adoration and corrupt praise. The Fallen rises, accompanied by hymns that drone like sanity's funeral dirge...
Siegelord captures the essence of this morbid tale, presenting it to you with musicianship both dark and powerful. Hope shall be forfeit when such soundscapes of war echo through forgotten lands... and when the last cry for battle has left our lungs you shall know the Fallen has ascended.
