NIGROMANTIA was formed in 2009, in the eastern part of Hungary. In the very beginning they played extreme metal, featuring symphonic elements as well. From this era their first demo was born, entitled ”Visions of Death” with 3 songs, which was released in 2009. One song ”End of Life” was adapted into a music video. Both the demo and the video have been a subject of many positive reviews.

In 2011 NIGROMANTIA's first self-released demo was born in 2011 entitled ”Blind Faith”, which contained 5 songs. Thus far, the EP has been well recieved not only in the band's mother country, Hungary, but also across Europe.

After the success of the "Blind Faith" demo, NIGROMANTIA recorded his first full length debut album in April 2012, at Noisehead Studios, Austria. The album entitled "Inherited Burden" will be released in fall of 2012 by Noisehead Records.
