Virginia Jetzt! was a German indie pop band founded in the small town of Elsterwerda in Brandenburg in 1999. In May 2010 the band announced break-up for the end of the year. 

The band released four albums: Their 2003 debut album "Wer hat Angst vor Virginia Jetzt?" - a play on words from the Edward Albee play "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" - was followed by "Anfänger" in 2004, "Land Unter" in 2007 and their last one "Blühende Landschaften" in 2009.

Virginia Jetzt! are known for their emotional yet upbeat guitar pop. They are generally considered part of the new wave of German pop music which rediscovered German lyrics.

On October 22, 2010 they gave their last concert at Admiralpalast, Berlin.
