The Japanese band called themselves Psycho To Black on their first demo, but before their second demo they changed it into their current name. The band claims to be influenced by both Black Sabbath and Eyehategod, but the sludge/doom that PSYCHOTOBLACK plays lies much closer to the music of the latter. The band is also reccomendable for fans of Grief. Shared members with Coffins <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Psychotoblack">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
