Bizarre, doom-laden black metal is presented on their release "A Thousnd Cries Has the Night."   It features one long track with soundtrack of horror feel and some avant-flourishes/noise interludes. The music is violent and chaotic like mix between Leviathan (US) meets earlier Emperor, and Mike Patton's Fantomas also seems invoked in their sound of otherness.  (You can read more about this band at the Aquarius Records website.)
