The band ANTROPOID was formed in november 2003, when Igor(guitar, vocals) joined three guys, Tomas(guitar), Jan(bass) and Marek(drums), who were rehearsing at Mlada Garda. The guys liked similar music genres, they had some jams together, rehearsals, tried some riffs, some songs were created. This line-up worked for three months. However, they were not happy with his skills, they managed to change the drummer. Igor asked Gabriel, the drummer of the band Militia, and offered him free post. He agreed. The band could proceed with making 
new songs, and in june(4.6.2004) Antropoid launched its first concert. Since then guys had gigs frequently, and 10.8.2005 Antropoid recorded first version of song“INSANE BULLETS” in Exponent studio, Hlohovec. This song, and some live songs were placed on cd, and. This promo cd was named “INSANE BULLETS & LIVE FUCK” and guys presented this material at their gigs during september to november 2005. In november 2005 (17th – 20th) Antropoid in Exponent studio recorded new demo(INSANE BULLETS), which includes all Antropoid songs that guys played on gigs meantime.
