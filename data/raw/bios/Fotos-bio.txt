Fotos are an indie rock band whose members come from  Hamburg and Cologne. They began in 2006. The group consists of Thomas Heßler (guitar, vocals), Deniz Erarslan (guitar), Frieder Weiß (bass) and Benedikt Schnermann (drums).

The band has been inspired by British indie rock and their melodies have a British sound but with lyrics in German. They say that their theme and attitude fits more with the German rock-style.

They released their first album 26 September 2006 and were signed to Labels, a sublabel of EMI. In the summer of 2007 they played at the Hurricane and the Southside Festival and in 28 March 2008 they released their second album Nach dem Goldrausch.
