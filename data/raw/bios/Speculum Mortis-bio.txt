Speculum Mortis is a Pagan Black Metal band from North Italy that formed in 2003. After several changes, Speculum Mortis has now the definitive line-up. Speculum Mortis' sound is influenced by the old black metal school and medieval themes, with original and personal adds from the previous experiences of the band members. Lyrics and atmospheres are about historical macabre themes, such as the plague in Italy and Europe in 1348, which is the concept of the first full-length CD, titled ``1348``. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Speculum+Mortis">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
