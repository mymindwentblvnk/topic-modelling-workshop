Tal National is a band from Niamey, the capital city of Niger, West Africa’s largest nation (and one of the world’s poorest). Although they are hugely popular in their homeland where their music is heavily featured on Niger national TV, they can still be found selling their CDs on roundabouts in Niamey, since the country has no distribution system. Each year they do national tours, travelling 18,000 kilometres throughout Niger, performing shows in over forty cities.   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tal+National">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
