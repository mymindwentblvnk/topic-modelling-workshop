The Masters Apprentices were a leading Australian rock band of the 1960s and early 1970s, fronted by singer Jim Keays. They formed in Adelaide in 1964 and continued until 1972, reforming briefly in 1988 and on several subsequent occasions. The Masters were hugely popular throughout Australia, scored a string of chart hits and were consistently hailed as one of Australia's best live and recording acts. They started out as an instrumental band, rose to prominence during the mid-Sixties "Beat Boom", moved through psychedelia and bubblegum pop, finally becoming one the first and best Australian progressive/hard rock groups of the early Seventies. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/The+Master%27s+Apprentices">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
