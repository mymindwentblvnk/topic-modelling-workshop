The band's self-financed debut single in 1980/81 was 'Rapist in the Park' became an underground hit and all three tracks off their single were frequently requested on John Peel's Radio 1 show. The other two tracks were 'Pets' and 'I'm a Square'.

Members were:

Kevin Leigh - Guitar
Andrew Leigh - Bass
Peter Leigh - Guitar
Graham Snell - Drums

Second 7" single in 1982 was a 4 track EP, untitled but with the tracks 'Softly, Quietly or Shout', 'Steven', 'Inaminate Objects' and 'Marching Song'. Lisa Sinclair joined the group on alto sax and clarinet. Julie Hadwin who later went on to guest with The Style Council, sung on the this EP, replacing Kim Glenister, who fell out with the founding members Nick Page and the Leigh brothers.

Both were pressed in 'minimum runs' of 1000 copies and are uber-rare and valuable today.

The group disbanded in 1982/3 with the Leigh brothers continuing on as Johnny 7 until the mid- to late-1980s. 

Highlight gigs were at the Rock Garden, pubs in Hampstead and north London area, Brighton Poly, Bath Academy of Art, Rickmansworth (supporting Wilco Johnson and the Solid Senders) and Cassiobury College, Watford in 1978 where the 3-piece 'The Executives' opened for Anorexia. Two members of the Executives went on to form Wham!

Nick, Peter and Andrew are still in contact with each other despite Nick living in Australia and are good friends with Rudimentary Peni drummer Jon Greville.
