Sunz of Man is a Wu-Tang Clan affiliated group that currently consists of Prodigal Sunn, Hell Razah, 60 Second Assassin, Shabazz the Disciple and Killah Priest. The group's first incarnation also included 7th Ambassador and producer Supreme. Along with Gravediggaz and Killarmy, Sunz of Man is one of the most popular acts affiliated with the New York based hip-hop collective, Wu-Tang Clan.

Prior to becoming affiliated with the Wu-Tang Clan, Sunz were known as Da Last Future and included rappers Shabazz The Disciple and 7th Ambassador, along with producer Supreme. 7th Ambassador retired before the group's Wu-affiliated days really got started, and soon before the release of their debut album The Last Shall Be First in 1998 both Killah Priest and Shabazz began to clash with Wu leader RZA, both eventually effectively cutting their Wu ties and leaving the group for solo careers. Supreme was kicked out of the group in late 2000, when it was discovered he had been heavily bootlegging the group's music, including leaking a whole album titled The First Testament. Killah Priest, who was absent from the recording of the group's second album proper Saviorz Day in 2002, has began to rediscover his Wu-Tang ties and is expected to work with the group again soon, while Shabazz made his official return to Sunz Of Man in early 2003.
