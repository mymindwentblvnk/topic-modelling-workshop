Electronic soul pop musical group from Philadelphia. The band name was inspired by the love relationship between novelists Vita Sackville West and Virginia Woolf. 

Much of the music is vocal driven and includes a wide range of harmonies. Many have compared Pague's voice to that of Florence Welch. Jennifer Pague has been writing songs under the Vita moniker for the past two years. Her romantically tragic and adventuresome lyrics tie into her European travels to Belgium and the Netherlands.

The haunting harmonies and vocal layering combined with crazy instrumentation and simple drumming produce a sound that reflects R&B, soul, jazz, and powerful choral ballads.
