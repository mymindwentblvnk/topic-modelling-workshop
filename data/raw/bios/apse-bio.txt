Apse (pronounced /‘apps/) is a cadre of ghosts that has been wailing into the cold New England wind for a decade. In recent years the group has channeled itself through ATP Recordings, reaching a larger audience so all can immerse themselves in its dark realms. Its sounds are heard on the tribal atmospheric swamp of Spirit, the drug-addled lo-fi montage Eras, or recently on Climb Up’s more rousing gesture toward the light. The group's live performances - often known for their unmistakable dark intensity and shamanic conjurings - are not to be missed. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/APSE">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
