Letum is a dark ambient solo project from Lindesberg, Sweden, formed by Mattias Henriksson. The music of Letum is known for its haunting atmosphere and serene soundscapes, but also for the fairly short length of the songs relative to most artists in the genre.

The ideas that comprise Letum have existed for a long time, but it has only been in recent years that these ideas have manifested themselves in official CD releases. Mattias works on Letum in his spare time; professionally, he is a teacher and the manager of IT company Mint Solutions. Letum was signed to Swedish label Cold Meat Industries, the debut album, "The Entrance to Salvation", was released in 2001. It was followed by "Broken" in 2006.

The name of the project is often stylized as "Láº½tum". It is a Latin word which means death or demon in the underworld.
