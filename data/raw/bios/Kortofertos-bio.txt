Kortofertos is a solo fantasy metal project, created by Alexander Shvets (Kyiv, Ukraine)
The idea is to combine Fantasy in three aspects:  metal, story line and art.

The music is based on a fantasy story line and has two names - the first is composition name, second - story chapter name. That was made for two reasons: to make a bridge between fantasy story and music and to compensate the lack of songs. The primary genre is symphonic metal but the music is mostly instrumental, however every elemental album has its own song and a single. And If it is said that the album is about, for example, water element, than everything is filled with it, no politics, beer or other stuff. 

The fantasy part is about the druid adventures and how he fulfills his mission given by Life itself. People turned against gods and terrible things happened. And the druid must stop this somehow. The story will be available when it will be released.

The last but not least part is art. Every composition and, respectively, chapter has its own unique digital fantasy-style illustration, which describes one of the key moments there.
