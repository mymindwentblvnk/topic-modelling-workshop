Hacksaw to the Throat was a band from Oakland, California that was based on the idea of constant change. The band started as a 2-man grindcore assault, which soon evolved into a 4-man death metal band, transforming into the not so easily classified band they were until their break-up in 2007.

Their debut album entitled 'Tear My Eyes Out...' was a slice of thrash-influenced grind, but not enough to get them noticed outside of their local scene. But, with their second full-length "Wastelands," they displayed a much more experimental sound, drawing a vast range of influences from bands including Neurosis, Pig Destroyer and pg.99 to Radiohead and Godspeed You! Black Emperor. Unfortunately only a lucky few have experienced the talent that is Hacksaw to the Throat.

The band built up a huge reputation and following in the hardcore/metal community in the San Francisco Bay area, but they wished to spread their music further than that.
