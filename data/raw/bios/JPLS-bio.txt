Jeremy Jacobs first released his brand of very stripped down minimal techno on net labels such as Clever and Redevice. He made his first Minus appearance on 2006’s ‘min2MAX’ compilation, following it up with the 12” ‘Program’, which had the distinction of perhaps being the most minimal thing ever released on the label. In 2007 he released his debut longplayer ‘Twilite’ also on M_nus. 

Jacobs makes his home in Indiana, one of only two M_nus artists who don’t live in Berlin. The website mnml.nl asked him if he planned on moving there. “Not yet. Berlin’s cool and I like Europe but I do such good work in the U.S. because I don’t have anything to do there. I like feeling really isolated from everything else. So as far as right now I’ll still be in the U.S.”

JPLS also performs as a live act. He played at the ‘min2MAX’ showcase at the DEMF in Detriot in 2006 and the M_nus New Year’s Eve showcase in Rome, Italy that same year, where he performed live in front of 10,000 people.
