Flowers From The Man Who Shot Your Cousin is American musician Morgan Caris from Wappingers Falls, New York. 

His debut album Hapless was released in 2006 on Waterhouse Records in France. It is said to be reminiscent of early Leonard Cohen or late Nick Drake with soft melodies, quiet guitars and bare arrangements that evokes Smog or the Silver Jews with dry and sometimes darkly sarcastic lyrics. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Flowers+From+the+Man+Who+Shot+Your+Cousin">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
