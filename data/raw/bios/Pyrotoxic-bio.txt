Pyrotoxic plays uncompromising high-speed thrash metal with influences drawn from the most legendary old school masters such as Dark Angel, Bulldozer, Tankard, early Slayer, Destruction and Armagedom. 
The band was formed in early 2006 when Liisa was looking for members to play in her ultra-brutal thrash metal act. Liisa knew Markus from earlier band projects, and Markus seemed like the only decent drummer around. Then Liisa got to know Ville, who was also interested in playing thrash metal. The original bass player Taneli joined the band quickly after Ville.

Taneli left the band in early 2007 to pursue career in Nailgunner, and was almost immediately replaced by Teemu. Since the very beginning there had been ideas of adding another guitar to the band in order to create a heavier sound. However, it seemed impossible to find the right guy to fill in the spot, and after a few less-successful try-outs with different guitarists the band decided to keep it simple and continue as a 4-piece. After recording the 1st demo Pyrotoxic decided to give the 5th member another try, when Antti seemed like the guy the band had been looking for. 

The plans for the future are clear: Weâ€™ll play as much gigs as possible in Finland and abroad and continue to wreak havoc on disc.
