Hawksley Workman (born March 4, 1975) is the stage name of Ryan Corrigan, a Canadian rock singer-songwriter who has acquired critical approval for his original yet accessible blend of cabaret pop and glam rock.

He was born in Ontario, Canada, near Huntsville in the Muskoka region, north of Toronto. To pursue his musical career, he later moved to Toronto.

His first album, 1999's "For Him and the Girls" earned him comparisons to the likes of Tom Waits, Rheostatics and Harry Nilsson.

"(Last Night We Were) The Delicious Wolves", released in 2001, became Workman's breakthrough record both in Canada and Europe, spawning the hit singles "Striptease" and "Jealous of Your Cigarette".

Workman has also produced records for a number of other artists, including Serena Ryder, John Southworth, Tegan and Sara, Sarah Slean, The Cash Brothers, and Great Big Sea.
