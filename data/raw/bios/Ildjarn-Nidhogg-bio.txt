Ildjarn-Nidhogg is the name under which Ildjarn released music recorded with friend and collaborator Nidhogg. Much like Ildjarn's other output, the style of music ranges from raw black metal to peaceful ambient music.

The Ildjarn-Nidhogg name first appeared on the 7" Norse EP in 1993, and again in 1996 on the Svartfr√•d MCD. These two releases, along with unreleased tracks, later appeared on a compilation entitled Ildjarn-Nidhogg years later in 2003 after Ildjarn ceased recording music. The two musicians also recorded an album of serene ambient music entitled Hardangervidda which was released in 2002. Leftover tracks from this session were subsequently released on MCD under the title Hardangervidda Part 2 in the same year. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ildjarn-Nidhogg">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
