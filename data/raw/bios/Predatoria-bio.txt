Predatoria was assembled in 2004 by Koen (Vocals) and Croess (Bass) after leaving their previous band. 

After several try-outs with a different line-up the empty spaces in the band were eventually filled up by Hannes (Guitar), Dille (Guitar) and Kristof (Drums). 

From beginning 'till end Predatoria combines groove and melody, the old school way! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Predatoria">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
