Officially, the group has existed since September 4, 2009, when Archangel and Mortis decided to create a group in the direction of black-death metal. The group was well educated members of other groups. The first official full composition of the group established in mid-January of 2010. Then it was as follows: Archangel - Guitar, Mortis - Bass, Frost - vocals, Ed - guitar, Infernus - drums. Then in early April, after a series of concerts, there were changes in the composition - the drummer and vocalist left the group. It was decided that the vocals will perform Archangel and Mortis. Later it was decided to expand the group Dark Omen. The group came Krumper. He replaced the guitar playing Archangel, and the Archangel became a main vox with assistance from Mortis (vocals).
