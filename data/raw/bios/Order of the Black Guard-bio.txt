OOTBG are an English Metal band formed in England in 2008 and subsequently released their now very rare "Brotherhood of the Grim" demo which featured raw versions of tracks from their debut album "The Way of cross and dragon" on Victory by fire records.  They use many genres to create their stripped back sound ranging from Black Metal, Doom, Punk, English folk music and traditional Heavy Metal. Their second album "Black is the colour, none is the number" is due for a late 2012 release. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Order+of+the+Black+Guard">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
