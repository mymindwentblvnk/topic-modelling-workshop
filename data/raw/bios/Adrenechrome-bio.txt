Like zombies with a taste for flesh... Adrenechrome is a quartet of heavy metal monsters set upon the world with an appetite to bring back good old fashion in your face, no frills rock n' roll. The early spring of 2010 saw the formation of Adrenechrome in their hometown of Orillia, Ontario. The four horsemen consisted of Chris "Chutty" Friesen - ripping riffs and furious lead vocals, Timmay Kehoe - stinging guitar and haunting background vocals, Matt Copeland - god of thundering drums operatic harmony vocals and Mike Van Dyke - dark lord of the rumbling, gut busting bass. All members shared the same love of heavy metal greats like Pantera, Black Sabbath, Think Lizzy, Metallica and the new fresh sounds of Mastodon, High on Fire and Children of Bodom. It wasn't long and summer saw the boys tearing it up for audiences around Ontario, showcasing their blistering all original set and becoming tighter every step of the way. Sonn, Ontario alone couldn't handle the roaring beast, Adrenechrome had to unleash it's fury outside the province and headed east to Ottawa and Montreal to give the francophones a stiff shot of old-school meets new school metal offerings, true Adrenechrome style. Their 1st tour was a smelly success, with the boys finding their road leg's quite nicely. So now as they spread like Ebola across the country and internet [and soon the world] these harried road warriors will continue to unleash sonic mayhem, liquefying the guts and minds of any man, woman, animal, mineral and vegetable within ears shot.
