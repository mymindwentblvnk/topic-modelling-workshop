Karkadan was founded in 1997, inspired by the upcoming extreme metal acts of this time, to create its own style of extreme metal. The line up at this time consisted of Robby Beyer (Vocals), Thomas Reeß (Drums), Felix Moosmann (Bass), Florian Spannagel and Daniel Pütz (Guitars).

Working on their mixture of heavy metal and extreme black / death metal vocals, the band entered the studio for the first time in 1999. The Maranis Studios (Sanvoisen, Sadian, Nocte Obducta, Fallen Yggdrasil) were chosen to record the debut album Eternal Black Reflections in December 1999.

After the recordings for the first album, Florian and Felix left the band for musical reasons, Thomas for health reasons. The line up was completed by Marcel Frano on drums, Christian Grunenberg on Bass and Philip Oefner on Guitars. 

In 2001 the band joined Belphegor, Eisregen, Mystic Circle, Agathodaimon and Lord Belial as support and performed at Summer Breeze Open Air. Martin Daniel joined the band as permanent drummer.

Their second album Utmost Schizophrenia was recorded during 2003. After the recordings Daniel Pütz left the band and was replaced by Johannes Kirchherr. The album was released the next year by Supreme Chaos Records. The album became voted on place 11 (out of 70) in the soundcheck of the German Legacy Magazine and got awarded as album of the month by Morbid Sounds and Bloodchamber.

Because of lack of motivation, drummer Martin was replaced by Johannes Gronover in 2005, the year in which the band supported Suidakra, the band played at Zabbaduschder Open Air and Metallic Noise Festival. 

In 2007, the band played live with Rage, Legion of the Damned and Communic and at Inferno Festival in Norway and again Summer Breeze Open Air. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Karkadan">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
