Hailing from the North of Portugal, Alijó, Stuprum Dei, the latin for “God Rape”, was rised in the fall of ’02, satanically invoked in war with the pure intention of spreading chaos and terror as a blasphemous worship for Satan.

Stuprum Dei is an admittedly campy and evocative devilish band with a twist of humour necromancing the past orthodox, now considered unorthodox by the less attuned, thus becoming re-innovative, harking unto the Satanic roots of original Metal, particularly in the guitar riffs, basslines and classicly legendary melodies, while remaining completely true in their own right, retaining integrity, as it comes from the black heart. A Satanic band who has successfully travelled from the past through the "star" gate to the present.

In the beginning, Stuprum Dei used to practice Raw Black Metal. The band evoluted during a few years in different ways, transforming their own songs and sound, to a more technique style, with a strong influence of Death and Brutal Death Metal. This musical evolution, as well as the continued equipment work had become to what is the band nowadays.  As a consequence of this continued evolution, Stuprum Dei can say that they are reaching their own sonority and style.
