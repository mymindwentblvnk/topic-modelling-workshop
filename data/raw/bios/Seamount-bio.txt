Seamount is a traditional Heavy Doom Metal band from WÃ¼rzburg, Bavaria formed in 2007, influenced by the Fathers Of Doom, Pentagram, Black Sabbath, Saint Vitus and Revelation ...with a pinch of NWOBHM elements.

Seamount is a band that features four extremely talented German guys on the basic instruments and a restless American vocalist behind the microphone, that is no other than Phil Swanson. Far from a "new guy" when it comes to heavy/doom metal scene, since his voice has graced numerous bands, the most notable being Upwards Of Endtime, Atlantean Kodex and Hour Of 13
