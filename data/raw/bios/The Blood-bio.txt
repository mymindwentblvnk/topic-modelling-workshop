The Blood are an English, London-based punk rock band, formed in 1982. Led by Cardinal Jesus Hate and JJ Bedsore (AKA Colin Smith and Jamie Cantwell), the band formed in the early 1980s under the name "Coming Blood". Their music is a blend of hardcore punk, Oi!, heavy metal, football chants and shock rock.

Many of their songs criticize religion or discuss political or philosophical topics.

Their first single, "Megalomania", ridiculed the Pope. Doctor Wild Thing played drums on 'Megalomania'. Their second single release "Stark Raving Normal" (a double A side with Mesrine) criticized one-dimensional patriotism, apathy and mediocrity. The Cardinal calls himself a punk secular humanist.[1] Their first album, False Gestures for a Devious Public featuring Evo (ex Angelic Upstarts,Warfare & Major Accident)on drums (1983), hit the UK top 30 and was voted one of the yearâ€™s best releases by Sounds magazine.[2][3] They used to be managed by Garry Bushell, and their song "Such Fun" was on the Oi! compilation album Oi! Oi! That's Yer Lot!. 'False Gestures For A Devious Public' 1983 also included the song 'Mesrine' which was an anthem about the French iconoclastic gangster Jacques Mesrine. 'Mesrine' by The Blood was released in 1983 which preceded the release of the film of the same name that was made in 1984. J.J. Bedsore died in 2004 of multiple organ failure due to years of chronic alcoholism.

On 10 December 2006, (International Human Rights Day) The Blood was reformed by the Cardinal and some of his friends to release the song, "Kill The Pimps", on the Eyeline Productions record label.
