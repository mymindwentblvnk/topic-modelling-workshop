Desolace Divine is a Melodic Metal band that aims to create songs from all walks of life; from ballads to a heavy sound to more mellow melodic music. The message of the lyrics are not subject to a narrow view either, ranging from fantasy themes to love songs to battle marches. 

The band Desolace Divine was founded in October 2010 by Martin Vos, Xander ten Boden and Linda van Vugt. Together they started looking for other musicians. They started writing songs together, and later found Jeffrey as the bassist. After a long search for a drummer, with several auditions in between, Rob joined the band on the 3th of November, 2011. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Desolace+Divine">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
