While major cities of the east and west coast are looked to for the latest trends in electronic dance music, there is formidable action bubbling in the vicinity of the Midwest. This is where longstanding DJ and producer Apparatus resides and from where he has been steadily and reliably creating entrancing sounds. Drawing as much from futuristic elements of progressive house, tech house, and electro music as from traditional music sources, Apparatusâ€™ approach has the accessible sensibility to appeal to a wide range of listeners at the same time keeping its dance floor roots.
