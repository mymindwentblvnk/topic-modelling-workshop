Since 1992, the name of PLATANUS does stand for unconventional intensity, experimental flexibility and emotional authencity. In their songs, PLATANUS tell about the mania of man, about beloved hatred and hateful love, about the abysmal truth with all it's tedium lies.

In March 1999 PLATANUS inclosed themselves in the SUBSONIC STUDIO of Carlos Silva - a man who's outstanding productions for SUDDEN DEATH and MORBUS justified the trust put into his work.

TESTSET

is a shining reflectance of the headstrong complexion of PLATANUS, enriched with a five-polar interpretation and the hidden side-effects caused by secret collegue CS. This all makes a blend, that evaporates the recently emerging tidal wave of Hipmetal to a superfluous drop.
