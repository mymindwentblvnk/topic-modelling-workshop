Wall of Death, together since April 2010, is now ranked among the principal exponents of the new European post-psychedelic rock scene.
Inspired by the scintillating understatement of the Velvet Underground, the esthetics of Pink Floyd, the stridency of Neu and the Silver Apples, this trio of Gabriel (vocals, guitar, sitar), Brice (keyboard, vocals) and Adam (drums) draws us into their somber, troubling world of uncertainty, perpetually seeking the keys to its future in the ruins of the past.
With roots extending from America to old-world European culture, Wall of Death creates a sound that is powerful, heavy, haunting and visionary.
A synthesizer reaching deep into the bass register, an acid-tinged guitar drenched with echo, a warm-toned organ and violent drums combine with voices that range from soaring to fathomless, creating a masochistic yet flamboyant universe in which this group heals its collective wounds. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wall+of+Death">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
