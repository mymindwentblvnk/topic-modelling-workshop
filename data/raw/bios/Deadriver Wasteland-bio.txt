Deadriver Wasteland plays heavy metal . Originally rooted in British Columbia, Canada's isolated central interior badland, Prince George, they currently reside among the skyscrapers of the largest city in the province, Vancouver B.C. Like a band of gypsies they marched out in search of the opportunity to play their trade. From the start they have shared the same vision, to remain united and true to the music. They are die-hard metalheads who despise glamour, rockstars, and the weakness that afflicts all popular image driven music.
