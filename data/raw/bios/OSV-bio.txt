O S V - Project is an all Instrumental project featuring progressive/fusion style music highlighted with top end guitar soloing and melody. The project was started by bassist Steve Sexton, Drummer Gary Oppert & Keyboard/guitar player Brandon Vaughn in 2006 with the intent to write several full length CD's ( projects ) and find the right lead guitar player(s) to compliment these projects. OSV feels they have done this on "Mission One" with Mathias Holm a great guitar player from Sweden & Paco Hernandez another great guitar player from Spain. Forward looking the plan is to release a 10-12 song CD for the first OSV-Project entitled: OSV-Mission One Featuring Mathias Holm & Paco Hernandez. We are waiting on the guitar lead sections for the final track and the CD will be complete. Details will be updated at this site as the project advances.
