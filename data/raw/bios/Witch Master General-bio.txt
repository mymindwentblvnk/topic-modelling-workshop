Witch Master General were formed in 1986 by Mark Beaudoin (lead guitar) and Tom Kavanagh (drums) in Nepean (now part of Ottawa), Ontario. Their first work was a cass that consisted of two different rehearsals, of which 30 were made but it remained unreleased. Shortly after, the band got to record Winds Over Salem, in 1988, and a second and final demo, Discontent, in 1989. Eventually, they changed their name to Red Orchestra (named after a song of theirs off the Discontent tape) and released the song "African Raindance" in the various artists Capital Punishment compilation. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Witch+Master+General">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
