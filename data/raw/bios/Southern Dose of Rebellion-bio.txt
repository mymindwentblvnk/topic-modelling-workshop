SDR reigns from the great Southern state of Texas right outside of San Antonio. San Antonio is known as a metal city but doesn’t have any bands waving the Texas flag as National Acts. SDR is here to change that. Like the many bands of the past, we bring in many influences to make a Southern onslaught of heavy riffs, screeching solos, blasting drumbeats, and brutal vocals. Prided on our dominating live performances, we will play any show at any venue and promise to leave the fans in awe. Southern Dose is made up of Riley on vocals, Corey on guitar, and Clint on drums. We are a fresh band but are quickly moving up the ladder and making a name for ourselves as a force to be reckoned with in the local metal scene. Come check out a show near you and you’ll see that our rebel ways are here to stay. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Southern+Dose+of+Rebellion">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
