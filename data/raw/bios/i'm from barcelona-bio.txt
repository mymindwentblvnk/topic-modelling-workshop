Despite their name, I'm From Barcelona is a pop group from Jönköping, Sweden.

They have around 30 band members and use an eclectic mix of instruments such as clarinets, saxophones, flutes, trumpets, banjos, accordions, kazoos, guitars, drums, and keyboards among others. While most band members provide backing vocals on releases and during live performances, Emanuel Lundgren is founder, principal songwriter and lead singer for the group.

In 2006 the band released an EP entitled Don't Give Up on Your Dreams, Buddy! as well as a full length album, Let Me Introduce My Friends - both of which were well-received critically. Their second full-length album, Who Killed Harry Houdini?, was released in October 2008. Forever Today followed in March 2011.
