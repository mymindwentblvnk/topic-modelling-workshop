White Ring is a dark, trance-inspired duo based in New York, NY. Formed in the mid-2000s, White Ring began to emerge sometime in the middle of 2008. White Ring's first release was a split 7" with oOoOO on Sweden's Emotion Records - the split featured the track Roses. Roses was also featured on the duo's debut EP, Black Earth That Made Me, released in later 2010/2011. They also released a 12" single for Felt U, with a Neil Young cover as a b-side. White Ring is currently working on a debut album, slated for release in the summer of 2012. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/White+Ring">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
