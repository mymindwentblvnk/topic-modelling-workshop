Malignant Monster is raw, cutting-edge, blood-soaked, blackened thrash metal from Perth, Western Australia. 

Malignant Monster represents man harbouring, and outwardly expressing, the deepest levels of human ugliness and perversion. An unstoppable, calculated and malicious fiend. An invisible epicentre of evil, sending shockwaves throughout and beyond his community. A jackal, a vulture, a snake, a wolf in sheep’s clothing. A face in the crowd: a neighbour, acquaintance, associate, somebody’s brother, somebody’s son. Hiding in plain sight. Draining the world of its colour.
