Noble Beast is a Minnesota-based traditional/power-metal band. We're influenced by everyone from Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, and Dio, to Blind Guardian, Helloween, and Symphony X, to Kreator, Emperor, and Ensiferum. We probably have at least one song you'll like. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Noble+Beast">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
