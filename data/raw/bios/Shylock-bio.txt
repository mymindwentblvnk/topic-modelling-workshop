1) Progressive rock band, 1970s, France

With endless comparisons to King Crimson, Shylock remains one of the premier French symphonic bands. Other comparisons are made to Arachnoïd and Pulsar. Darkness is the key here. Their influence can be felt in such bands as Xaal, Minimum Vital, Tiemko, and Änglagård.

1977's "Gialorgues" was recorded with the primary membership consisting of drummer André Fisichella, guitarist Frédéric l'Épée (who went on to play with Philharmonie), and keyboardist Didier Lustig. Bass player Serge Summa was added for the second album, 1978's "Ile di Fievres" (Fever Island).

Their outstanding moments are shown in their more lengthy compositions. However, virtuosic musicianship was never absent. 

2) Melodic heavy metal band from Germany formed in 1998. Released Walking Tall in 2013.

3) Swedish heavy metal band who released one demo and had one track appearing on the "Metal Knights" compilation.
