Thomas Fehlmann's musical biography started in 1979 when he met Robert Fripp (King Crimson) and started experiments with synthesizers. One year later he formed the band Palais Schaumburg (together with Holger Hiller) which lasted until 1984. In 1988 he founded the record label "Teutonic Beats" to promote electronic music from Germany. He joined  The Orb  as a floating member in 1990.
Now that his work with The Orb has earned him a place in electronic music history, Fehlmann is afforded the artistic license to transcend all previous boundaries. His musicality and experimentalist drive converge with exceptional grace and system-bumpin' appeal. Granular hip-hop grooves and exotic chord structures interface with bold, synthetic finesse, while his housier inner child locks down some precision dance-floor cuts immersed in fluidly manipulated filtration. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Thomas+Fehlmann">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
