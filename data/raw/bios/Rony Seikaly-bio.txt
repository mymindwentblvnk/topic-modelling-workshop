Rony Seikaly is known for his spinning moves around the opposing team's defense on the basketball court. These skills garnered him the nickname, "The Spin Doctor." In the last few years Seikaly has become known for a different kind of spinning: Music.

The former NBA superstar is not new to music or DJing. Since the age of 14, Seikaly has had a music room in any home he has lived in. Here, Seikaly plays music for friends, parties, gatherings, birthdays. Any type of event, and Seikaly is the one behind the decks. The more friends and friends of friends were exposed to Seikaly's talents, the more he was encouraged to share his DJing skills and selection with the public. Two years ago, Seikaly was convinced to play out for fun, and the DJ rollercoaster ride has not stopped.

"Sports will always be my love. But music will always be my passion," Seikaly--now an in-demand DJ and producer--states.

Driving, high energy, and most of all uplifting, Seikaly's passion for the music is threaded through his seamless mixes. Drawing from all the genres he is intimately acquainted with and the DJs whose methods he admires, Seikaly brings in the best of the best. Touches of trance-inflected melody lines, dynamic tribal rhythms, subtle yet memorable vocals, a soulful vibe, and an ever present body-shaking beat all figure into Seikaly's sets. In the course of an evening, one can experience a little bit of Morillo, Danny Tenaglia, Pete Tong, Sven Vath, Behrouz, Paul Oakenfold, Sasha, and Digweed in a Seikaly helmed nightclub.
