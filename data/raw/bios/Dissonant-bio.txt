Dissonant is an Israeli fresh sounding metal band formed in late 99. People have tried to classify Dissonant's music under different styles but nether the less, Dissonant prefers not to grasp on any specific genre.
With dozens of past shows and six years of experience, Dissonant is a well organized band which compromises on nothing. Dissonant's debut album, Consolidated Reality Fragments - (1000 copies limited edition), which was entirely self-recorded, produced and mixed, shows Dissonant's ability to create an international-standard release without any outside support.

Dissonant started out as a fun/instrumental band which came to realize its writing and composing potential. Over the years, Dissonant has been focusing on writing and performing while molding into its current structure. Dissonant's album consists of six songs which are marking stones in their musical evolution.

Today Dissonant is on a quest for an international recognition by searching a label that will take Dissonant's music to a new level.
