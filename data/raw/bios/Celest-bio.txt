1) Celest is an independent band from Mexico City. Started by Jerónimo Quintana, Florencia Quinteros, Jerónimo Hill, and Roderic Picard. Their sound is a mix of dream pop, ambient, and alternative rock. In 2017, they debuted with their first EP, entitled Noches de Huracán. Their first single, "Ghosts" was included in the soundtrack of the Mexican film Camino a Marte, directed by Humberto Hinojosa, being the song of the final credits and the official song trailer for which they won the Silver Goddess for Best Song Original. Their name comes from the fascination for the sky, the cosmos, and the color of the sea. It is a musical project that emerges from the playful practice of male and female voices.
