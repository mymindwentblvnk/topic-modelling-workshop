Tyron Kaymone Frampton (born 18 December 1994), better known by his stage name slowthai, is an English rapper from Northampton, Northamptonshire. In addition to being included in the BBC's Sound of 2019 poll and NME's NME 100 list, Frampton has also received acclaim from publications such as DIY, Vevo, and Metro.

Frampton is well known for his notoriously gritty and rough instrumentals and raw, politically charged lyrics, especially around Brexit and Theresa Mayâ€™s tenure as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. His stage name originates from his childhood nickname - Frampton had a speech impediment which caused him to speak slowly and with a drawl. Originally known as Slow Ty, he changed it to slowthai when he released his first single in 2016. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/slowthai">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
