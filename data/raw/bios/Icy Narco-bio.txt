Rolando Gomez (b. June 23, 1998), better known by his stage name Icy Narco, is an American recording artist coming straight out of Miami, Florida.

He first rose to fame following the release of "Viagra Niagra," but later came into more mainstream spotlight under the wing of Elliot Grainge's 10K Projects label, where he released songs such as "Numb & Frozen," “Otherside,” and his biggest song to date, "LINK," The success of these songs has helped him get onto major Hip-Hop media outlets such as XXL and WorldStarHipHop.

He has since gone on to tease more tracks, collaborating with fellow South Florida rappers such as ohtrapstar, Kid Buu, and producer Jimmy Duval to create the first song he made after moving to L.A., "EASE THE PAIN (Legend)."

Icy's debut album, WINTER CAN BE MURDER, released on September 27, 2019. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Icy+Narco">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
