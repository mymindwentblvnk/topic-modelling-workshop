American deathcore band from Greensboro, NC, formed in 2001. They are well known for their abundant use of audio samples from western pop culture video entertainment.

The band began as a studio project, releasing an EP, Inhaling the Breath of a Bullet, in 2002. Two years later they changed their lineup and released their first full length album in 2004 entitled Never Good Enough for You. Since then, the band has released three more studio albums, a DVD, and a box set of re-mixed and re-recorded material from their early years.
