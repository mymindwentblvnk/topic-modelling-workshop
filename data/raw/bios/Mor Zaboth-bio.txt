The band was established in the summer of 2005. Myotis (guitar, vocals), Sornaal (guitar) and Tuthir (drums) were soon joined with Eutera (keys). Later on, a session bass player, Pecolar also joined the band. In November Mor Zaboth had their first gig in “Bodega bar” in Maribor. Soon after the concert Pecolar left the band due to different reasons. Despite the fact, Mor Zaboth continued to create new music and plan new concerts.

Secondly Mor Zaboth performed in “MC Pekarna” on a Christmas Metal Attack. Nejc G. (Infidia) came to their assistance and filled in for the missing bass player. However the decided to look for a permanent bass player. Olfjor turned out to be a good musician and a good friend, so he became a permanent member of Mor Zaboth. Two more concerts followed. They performed at Metal Alliance Fest in Kurd, a hall in “Pekarna in Maribor” and at the Black Metal Holocaust in Channel Zero in “Metelkova in Ljubljana”. A rather creative era was following, in which many different music ideas and plans for the future were made. Afterwards the group decided to go to the Studio Ultra and record their first demo, Towards The Darkest Dawn which came out in January 2007. In autumn a collaboration between Mor Zaboth and and another band, Sabaium took place. A result was a smaller tour around Slovenia in different clubs(Chanell Zero, Mc Kreš, AKD Izbruh, Koruzjak), and many new experiences, ideas and friendships were built. The band Mor Zaboth has played 2/17/2007 for the first time this year in Gornja Radgona MD Grom. They are doing new stuff for their next album at the moment and won't have any concerts in the near future. Mor Zaboth play and make melodic black metal. They are inspired by darkness, mistycal and the everlasting beauty of nature. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mor+Zaboth">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
