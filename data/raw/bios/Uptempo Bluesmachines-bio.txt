Band from Ertvelde, Belgium.
Formed in 2002 by Stanny, Tim, Marlon and Kristof. After four years, when Kristof decided to leave, the band's set up changed. Eventually found it two new members: Sam & Bert. UBM's music is sometimes described as stoner metal spiced up with some good rock'n roll arrogance. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Uptempo+Bluesmachines">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
