It is difficult to imagine another band experiencing the same musical journey as Harvyst. Their ten year existence has seen them transform through various incarnations into a dance-inducing mind-meld of hard techno, jamtronica, and trance. Harvyst have successfully infiltrated the dance/DJ scene in a short period of time, performing at festivals, breweries, and underground raves, and sharing the stage with many popular Michigan electronic artists such as Jay Denham, SuperDre, Punisher, and Detroit Techno Militia artists DJ Seoul, T. Linder, Dark Cube and DJ Psycho.  In addition, Harvyst have kept one foot in the jam band scene, opening for national artists such as Boombox and Signal Path.  A Harvyst show has always been a unique performance unto itself, a one-time event that will never be repeated, and listeners across the state have long been confused, intrigued, and entertained by their sonic explorations.
