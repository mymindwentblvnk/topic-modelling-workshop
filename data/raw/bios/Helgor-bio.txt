Helgor was formed in the year 2000. Four different people with different musical backgrounds joined forces to conjure up the sound that gives Helgor its bizarre face.

Vocalist Erik gets most of his inspiration from melodic death metal and Russian music. His interpretations of his own lyrics give a Helgor song a sick twist. Erik's inspiration for writing lyrics comes mostly from cult horror movies.

Vocalist David is the pagan warrior among us. Musical inspiration is drawn from old Swedish death metal and obscure black metal. When writing lyrics, David is inspired by his Frisian ancestors and by paganism. When David starts singing, most people get the feeling as if they're locked up in a fridge. It's the sound of permafrost!

Vocalist/bassist Roeland is the one who brings a large quantity of volume with him. His screams sound like dying pigs suffering from foot and mouth disease. Inspiration is drawn from chaos and several forms of extreme metal. His lyrics deal with everyday insanity and frustration.

Vocalist/guitarist/drum programmer Dennis gets inspiration for song writing out of every sort of music. From Indian ragas to Impetigo, it doesn't matter. His vocal style is more conservative, he uses a lot of low grunting.

Helgor published their songs on the Internet and were soon picked up by Meathead records to appear on their "International Heavy Metal Box" compilation CD.

Helgor has released on demo containing the tracks: "Enslaving the Human Goulash", "Show Us Your Anger", "M.K.Z. Outbreak 2003", "Human Origami", "Flexor Carpi Radialis" and "Desperate War". This demo displays a great mix of several styles of metal: death, thrash, black, grind & doom.

Unfortunately Helgor disbanded in 2005. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Helgor">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
