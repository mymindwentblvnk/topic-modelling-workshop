Joseph Fris, formerly of Black Wolf Sakrifice, founded Sakrefix as a solo studio project in early 2005. Soon thereafter, he released the demo, Dark Spells Cast Under the Eclipsing Moon, to an enthusiastic underground and quickly sold every copy. The demand for a live set – not practicable as a solo project – was strong enough by 2006 that Mr. Fris allowed his child the breathing room that it demanded, and he enlisted the skills of four new musicians. Eric Gilstrap was added to Sakrefix’s ranks first; Gary Cadima (The Killing Machine, Abythos), Patrick Piecara (Nyarlathotep, Abythos), and Viktor Farinelli were added not long after. Immediately upon completing the lineup, Sakrefix headed to Amplitude Media in Austin, TX to record their debut full-length, In Shadow’s Embrace, and sent it to Bergen, Norway where Ivar Bjornson of extreme metal legends Enslaved mastered it. In support of the L.P., which was officially released by metalhit.com in July of 2008, Sakrefix has played shows across its home state of Texas, supporting such acts as Watain, Mictlantecutli, Book of Black Earth, Withered, Deceased, Insidious Decrepancy, Averse Sefira, and many more. Less than a year after releasing In Shadow’s Embrace, Sakrefix is now heading back into the studio to record their sophomore effort, Evolve, which, living up to its title, is a massive leap forward in terms of songwriting, and is sure to surprise long-time followers of the band. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sakrefix">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
