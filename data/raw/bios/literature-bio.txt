Four Austin gadabouts (members of Moth Fight) turned their attention to wrong-headed recording recordings and slant song songs, aiming for a sonic portmanteau of "enduring" and "endearing". They each succeeded in making loud noises, then editing one another to create a taut, novel sound. Melodies emerged from broken equipment and, one day, someone showed up with some actual chords and verse. Suddenly they're readying a slew of singles (produced by Greg Ashley of the Gris Gris) and touring the world.

An album appeared in 2012 called Arab Spring. Another is due in August 2014.
