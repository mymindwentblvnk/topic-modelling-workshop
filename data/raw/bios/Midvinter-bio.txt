Midvinter was a  Black Metal band from Sweden. 

The band was formed somewhere in 1993 and in 1994 they released their first demo, "Midvinternatt". In 1997 they released their first, and only, full-length, "At the Sight of the Apocalypse Dragon" and shortly after that the band split-up.

But in 2006, two of the old members got back together and a new full-length was planned to be released in 2008, but nothing has been heard of it since.
