Masterpiece is indie band from Central Europe. Important part of their music is DIY attitude (guerilla gigs, home recording, mobile phones videos) and eclecticism. Guitars, synthesizers, grooveboxes, laptops, pads, vocoders, samplers, pop melodies hidden behind sound and arrangement barricades of diverse genres. Breakbeat rhythms, noise guitars, hardcore singing (screaming), dance sound rising somewhere from all the electronic gadgets... And the whole is somewhat rock&roll like.
