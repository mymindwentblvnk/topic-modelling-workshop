BIOGRAPHY
Clapatria is a metal/rock band with the base in Malm√∂, Sweden. Our music is emotional and sometimes heavy, all embraced by a touch of melancholy and a dark atmosphere. But there is no forumula for how a typical Clapatria song must sound. We rip traditional song structures apart in a dynamic way. But we don't have to, we can also create a traditional song. The lyrics are about emotions, nature, the sad states of mind and aggression against injustice and failed politics. Right now Patrick and Clara form the base of the band, but we play with a guitar player and are currently looking for more members. Clapatria has only existed since 2004, but have already created almost 20 songs. 6 of them are included on our new demo CD <<Dystopia Dawn>>. Right now we are recording our third demo, As My Dream Devours, that will contain no less than 12 songs. In the near future we plan to make as many gigs as possible after finding the right musicians to play with. 

Cheers, Clapatria
