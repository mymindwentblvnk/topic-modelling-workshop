Mixing elements of hip-hop and rock & roll, Inhumans employ both symphonic skill and lyrical dexterity, making each performance an unpredictable roller coaster of laughter and screaming.
Consisting of seven members, Inhumans is:

Mite Aswel (Raps), Ivory Coyote (Raps and more), Saint Dennis (Guitar, Keys, Bass, Vocals), Cheebles (Bass, Keys, Saxophone), Enzymes (Turntables), Jojo Punivi (Trumpet, Guitar), and Cutthroat (Drums), with the occasional accompaniment of a female back-up trio called Heavy Flow.

Formed in Missoula Montana, Inhumans have been together since 2004, playing through-out the state, and opening for such acts as 2 Live Crew, Awol One and Scarub from Living Legends. Having marinated in their hometown juices long enough, and with the support of their large local following, Inhumans have decided to relocate and utilize Portland Oregon as a home base to supply the world with their unique blend of humor, intelligence, and style.
