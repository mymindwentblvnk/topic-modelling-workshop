After departing from black metal band Blessed By Fire of Detroit, Josh (drums) and Harley (vocals, keyboards) decided to go into a new direction with help from Josh's long time friend, Jeff, on guitar. Following the completion of new material, Peg (guitar) was added to the lineup. After recording demo material and lacking a bassist for a almost a year, Nick was chosen to play the 5-string and accompany with writing. After only one week of practice with Nick, Vintenar played their first gig with the completed roster at Paganfest '08 @ I-Rock in Detroit. Now with a final lineup, recording of a full-length is expected to be finished 09'.  Before they are released on the bands website, new songs are debuted through Ragnarok Radio based out Dearborn, MI.   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vintenar">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
