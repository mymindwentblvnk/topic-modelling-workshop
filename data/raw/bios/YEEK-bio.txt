A multimedia artist, filmmaker and musician who hails from Jersey, NJ.

Between mixtapes, producing, contemporary art pieces and flight hopping from state to state Yeek has finally been able to drop his first solo music video which he directed and edited himself.

I would probably describe my style as 'imaginative'. My main influences come from cartoon style illustrations, funk music, & the 90s hip-hop culture & 90s hardcore American punk culture. I would have to say the major difference between LA & Florida is that the people are meaner in Florida & that helped me grow as person. I was born in Jersey City, raised in Florida." - YEEK
