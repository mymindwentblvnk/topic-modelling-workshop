GuilThee is a Hungarian psychedelic death metal band from Veszprém.
The band was founded in June '06 to create a special toned death metal music with esoterical sounding. They prop the agressive howling crying vocal with robust guitar sound, complex riffs, tight drumming with double bass drum and mallet - convoluted bass. The feeling of songs is based on synth carpets.
