They compile an epic metal sound and a blisteringly destructive live shows. The band reside in the Reading area of the Berkshire metal scene which has spawned such impressive bands as Exit Ten, Sylosis and Malefice.

Signed to London based label Siege of Amida Records, and released their debut E.P. "Chronicles" which was released in 2007. This throws in metalcore influences with in the technical death metal that produces thrashing scaling guitars, grinding drums and screaming vocals with opposing growl vocals.
