Pink Siifu, born Livingston Matthews and based in Los Angeles, has made music under many other names, most prominently Iiye.  Matthewsâ€™ music weaves a web between various pillars of neo-soul, and sun-dried California hip-hop but at the center, there is a comprehensible Siifu. His persona is fully fleshed out: an earnest poet dependent on prayer but too shy to scan as self-serious, speaking his thoughts through the voices of others and disguising his own in crooked, glinting bars. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/pink+siifu">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
