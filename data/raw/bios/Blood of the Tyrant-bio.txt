Blood of the Tyrant is a metal quartet from Chicago that strikes a perfect balance between earth-shaking heaviness and elegant technical finesse. Drawing upon a wide array of influences that includes Meshuggah, Black Sabbath, Neurosis and Goblin, Blood of the Tyrant seamlessly combines the drama and melodic intuition of traditional heavy metal with the crushing brutality of the vibrant modern metal scene. Intricate guitar harmonies sit comfortably alongside plodding, doom-laden riffage and chaotic bursts of hardcore-inspired fury, and songs are carefully arranged to have a severe and lasting emotional impact. A maelstrom of progressive and metallic textures, Blood of the Tyrant is not to be missed. For fans of Mastodon, Baroness, Isis, High on Fire, Zombi, Today is the Day and Yakuza. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Blood+Of+The+Tyrant">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
