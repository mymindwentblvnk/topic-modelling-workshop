Bleeding Art is a Melodic Black Metal band with Death Metal influences from Poland. They formed during the mid 90s and started off with a Death Metal image. They worked their way into more Melodic but, Darkthrone-influenced stuff. 

"Moja Dusza" is their first 1997 demo. This demo was a good starter to lead them into their real unofficial album "In the Eternal Garden of Death" in 2000. Surely, it was more promoted because, it eventually lead into touring and became an independent split with Borgmester Dahl. However, Moja Dusza still wasn't released directly to the labels for audio purposes because, they also did show various band pictures within it.

After Bleeding Art's obscure independent status, they did some touring with Tromsnar, it was frank that they were ready to claim their status as Melodic Black Metal. The tour was notably recognizable for this.

Nowadays, Bleeding Art had split up but, still was acknowledgably reserved in Metal history. Supposedly, they didn't instigate any promotional ideas and wanted to leave their status quo as obscure but, still part of the scene of underground Independent Polish Black/Death Metal.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bleeding+Art">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
