Tender Games is an electronic pop music duo from Berlin who are signed by SUOL Music. It is the brainchild of two German producers; Ulrich Harrison AKA HRRSN, and his more-than-trusty sidekick, Marlon Hoffstadt.

Having bonded in Berlin through a mutual love of music, this eclectic pair are now traversing a path that's all set for the scene's upper echelons. While their inspirations are wide and varied (Harrison credits YouTube with much of his musical education, while Hoffstadt touched on everything from soul to funk to hip-hop during his formative years), it's a reciprocated merging of sounds and styles which pays off in spades.

While the pair are neither classically trained musicians or pretentious analogue heads, their rich and nuanced sound very much belies the fact. Indeed, theirs is a potent myriad of sounds that works wonders on the ear, with everything from modern to retro timbres merged into a sumptuous and delectable mix. Precocious, young and with an unrelenting thirst for quality-laden music, there's something refreshingly honest about the work of Tender Games.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tender+Games">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
