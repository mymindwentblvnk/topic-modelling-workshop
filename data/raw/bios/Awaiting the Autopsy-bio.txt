Awaiting The Autopsy was a slamming brutal death metal band from MÃ¼nster, Germany. They formed in 2007 by Ulli (Vocals), Briel (Guitars) and Chris (Drums, Poostew, Corporectomy) to play some of the sickest brutal death metal being made on this planet. The band do this well with their crushing guitars, blasting catchy drum patterns and guttural to high screamed vocals like Begging for incest meets Guttural Secrete.

The band set to work immediately with a 2-song demo "Eight Girls Instead of Nine" in 2007 via Amputated Vein Records which boosted their career in the underground because of the hyped up atmosphere this band created.

It was soon to make new material for the band in late 2008 and decided to call a hault to live performances until a follow up was out. They set to Third A Studio to record their debut full length album entitled "Couldn't Tell The Bodies Apart" via Amputated Vein Records on the April 29th 2009.
