A big part of Imperthean's captivating allure is due to the fact that his music and lyrics merge into a single cry which seems to reach us from outer space: the smart stop-starty scratching-like effects and the fuzzy eeriness of the vocals almost evoke a broken-down transmission from some unearthly being trying to reach us before it becomes too late. The being warns us and curses us, speaking heart-heavy words of regret, venomous rage and hate. As the story reaches its epilogue, it becomes apparent that this broken-down voice, barely able to reach our deaf ears, is indeed the collective voice of human conscience.   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Imperthean">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
