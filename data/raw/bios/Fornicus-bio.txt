Birthed in the heart of America's bible belt in late 2012, Fornicus was conceived to cast darkness over the ignorant masses and their foolish dogmas. Blending qualities of black, thrash, and even a taste of death the band creates a vicious aural assault that will quench the listenerâ€™s thirst for all things metal. Throughout the first year of the band's existence the songs that would become their debut album were meticulously crafted by members Scott, Chris, and David and eventually were completed with the addition of Kelly at the beginning of 2014. The tracking began shortly thereafter in Scott's own Velocity Studios for the album that is now known as "Storming Heaven," a bold statement chastising Christ and his blind sheep for their "righteous" ways with the ultimate goal of destroying God's Kingdom. With live rituals now beginning and the album's release, the force that is Fornicus will strengthen to take its place as one of Kentucky's premier practitioners of metal. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fornicus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
