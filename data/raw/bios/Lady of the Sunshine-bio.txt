Angus Stone reveals a darker more contemplative side on the brooding rhythm and blues of his first solo album 'SMOKING GUN', out April 2009.

Angus wrote, sang and played electric and acoustic guitar on the album of which he co-produced with his accomplice ‘Finn’ (Govinda Doyle) on drums and bass. The album was recorded over 6 weeks throughout 2008 in an old water tank in the scorching hills of North QLD, Australia. Finn’s wife would cook supper for them and her new born baby whilst they worked till the young hours of dawn. 

“I’ve been skipping off in between tours for about a year now to shake my head of these songs,” explains Angus, "Every one of the emotions in your head has it’s own voice and this album is what became of them." 

Smoking Gun sees Angus crawl into the alt music underground world, embracing a myriad of themes, emotions and genres that allowed Angus the freedom to take a simple idea for each song and let it take whatever trip it lead him on.
