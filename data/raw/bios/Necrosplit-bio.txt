Three friends, called Lukas Wowra,Daniel Sch√∂nberger and Max Hausjell decide to start a band. They knew from the very beginning, that their music will have to be fast and hard, but at the same time melodic, too.

So the first songs were written soon and cut in. Necrosplit combines fast and chunky riffs with aggressive vocals and anything necessary to convey their own interpretation of Thrash Metal. Currently they are writing new songs and cut them in to present them as soon as possible.

Now Necrosplit are looking forward to conquering the stages and inspiring the people with their music. The first demo CD The Beginning Of The End will probably be released in August.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Necrosplit">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
