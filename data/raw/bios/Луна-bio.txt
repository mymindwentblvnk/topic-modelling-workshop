Kristina Viktorovna Gerasimova (born in Dresden, East Germany, 28 August 1990), better known as Луна (Luna), is a Ukrainian indie pop singer-songwriter, model and photographer in the past. She's currently based in Kyiv, Ukraine.

Although she's described as the voice of a generation in Ukraine, Luna's career started in L.A., the spiritual home for all songs that talk of glamorous sadness. She moved to L.A. at the age of 20 with her husband and had her son there — beaches, palm trees, and sunsets on Venice Beach soon became the set for emotional turbulence and immigrant isolation. "I wrote my first songs in L.A., the city still holds my most intimate, my favorite memories," Luna explains. "This is where my child was born, and the most intense moments of my relationship took place. We left everything in Kyiv, we had a small child, didn't know anyone, we didn't really know how to love each other. In one moment when I was distressed I found some old poems I've written, and suddenly had a strong desire to go to the studio and record."

During her time in L.A., Kristina felt a strong connection to Ukraine which fueled the creative impulse. After the revolution of 2014, she came back with her family. "We felt a very strong desire to return to Kyiv. I got my ideas looking back at Ukraine, and really wanted come back and create, change something here. So I started to write again." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/%D0%9B%D1%83%D0%BD%D0%B0">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
