Life passes by. We leave nothing behind, but what our spirits create with all the love and devotion. ART is the most sublime creation of the human spirit, an eternal testimony of the artists gift towards humanity. Through art, the man outruns his limits, he becomes a Creator, he overcomes death, becoming immortal. MUSIC is art. MUSIC rises from our souls, from our minds and spririts. MUSIC is, for us, the path to Etenity, the chance of reaching forever Freedom. 

So here we stand, in front of you, revealing you our souls, our spirits, our TRUE MIND. 

Our dream, our purpose, our meaning is this: 

The Rise Upon Eternity where Music Inside Never Dies 

TRUE MIND’s story began in September 2006, when Vlad, Anna, George, Novac & Stefan started a new Melodic/Symphonic Metal band in Brasov, Romania. The band’s debut took place at the “Gaudeamus” International Festival in Brasov, where Anna won the special award for the “Best Vocalist in a Group”. The next recital was at a Halloween party, followed by a mention received at the “JoyArt” International Festival. The real concert debut was on the 27th of January 2007, in a “Rock Marathon” in Brasov with other 4 Romanian bands (Seven, Rising Shadow, Loudrage and Katharsis).
