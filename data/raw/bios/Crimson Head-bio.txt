Crimson Head were a independent melodic death metal band from Japan. Their only release was 'Bad Song' mini-album in 2005. They seemed to be heavily influenced by video game series Resident Evil (known as Biohazard in Japan) since their name was 'Crimson Head' and there are many audio exerts from the game in their songs. The song 'Crimson head' was later redone by Wild Turkey's next band, PLASMA JET.
Vocalist Wild Turkey is now known as Kosuke, playing bass in DEATHGAZE.
Guitarist/Bassist 勇人 is playing guitar in DELUHI (as Leda) and bass in Galneryus (as Yu-to).
