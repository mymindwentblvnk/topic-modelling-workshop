Psychicthrob was a death metal band from Quebec, Canada. They were formed in 1988 as the  Damaged and they decided to change their name in 1990 to Psychicthrob. Frank Beuurrkk (Vocals/Guitars) and Steve Cloutier (Bass) moved to Québec City and recruited Didier Gagnon as a drummer instead of Stéphane Provencher (ex-Gorguts, ex-Damaged).

The band then created an "Advanced Tape" in 1990 which leaned towards an earlier form of death metal and speed thrash metal variation. They then released a demo entitled "Bursting Dementia" in 1991 which focused more on staccato riffs and heavier basslines. They finally released an advanced 4 track tape in 1992 before splitting up.
