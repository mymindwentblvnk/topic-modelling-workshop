DAMNABLE came into being in May 1992, with the line- up: Yehovy (vocals), Clans (bass), Melon (drums), and Andy (guitar). After about a year of its existence Rolly (bass) joined the band and Clans started to play the guitar. Some very brutal stuff was created as for these days. In April 94 Yehovy left the band and he was replaced by Bayn (vocals). With this new line-up DAMNABLE recorded a rehearsal tape, thanks to which the band was able to play on the biggest musical festival in the east of Europe-FMR Jarocin 94. After the Festival the band recorded a demo with 8 tracks entitied „Obsession Pain" in Salman Studio in Bialystok (August 94).

At the end of 1996 Clans left the band. His seat was replaced by Bayn (guitar & vocals). A good run began with the mini-tour in January, in Poland, with the Sweedish band DERANGED. After the tour, the band recorded a new material entitied "INPERDITION", the Polish label Immortal Rec release "Inperdition" on MC. The same material was supposed to be released on CD by the Italian label CRYPTIC SOUL PROD. Unfortunately the CD hasn't appeared till now and these are the Italians who take the Blame for that.

In July '97 the German T&M RECORDS released 2 tracks of DAMNABLE on a split 7” EP with the Spanish HAEMORRHAGE.
In 1998 a new deal was signed with NOVUM VOX MORTIS. As a result of that a new album entitled " The Futuristic Trial of Mankind " was recorded in Selani Studio in Olsztyn. It was released as a split MC & CD with the band INCARNATED. Later on, Melon left the band and was replaced by Sivy. At the beginning of 2000 the contract was signed with RELAPSE REC. For the re-edition of "INPERDITION " in the form of 4 Way “POLISH ASSAULT” Split-CD. After the recordings Sivy deceided to leave DAMNABLE, so they continued as 3-piece.

In 2001 the Band played a Mini-tour with VULGAR DEGENERATE and also well known festivals like FUCK THE COMMERCE IV, OBSCENE EXTREME III, BRUTAL ASSAULT and MORBIDE FESTSPIELE. Minitour with Brainwash and a lot of other gigs are planned for the future. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Damnable">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
