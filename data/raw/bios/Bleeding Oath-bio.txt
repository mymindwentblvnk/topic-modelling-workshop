Bleeding Oath are a London based Progressive Metal band founded in December 2009 adding something fresh and new to the British metal underground scene.

Their sound, which fuses together elements of Progressive Metal, Black Metal and Jazz played in a brutal, yet experimental context, has resulted in a unique sound which sets them apart from other metal bands.
Their influences include Opeth, Dream Theater, Meshuggah, Emperor, Between the Buried And Me and many more. Prior to the release of their Debut EP in 2012, the band released several demos, mainly consisting of material recorded and programmed solely by band-leader Haigh. The band supported Evile in the thrash metal band's UK tour leg in Camden, and competed in the Road to Bloodstock competition, losing in the semi-finals. Shortly before this semi-final, bassist Ben Janes left the band for undisclosed reasons and was replaced by Moat Lowe. In December 2011 Terrorizer Magazine named Bleeding Oath the "Best Unsigned Band" of 2011. Their debut EP was released in early 2012 to a positive reception. However in February 2013 the band broke up, sighting numerous creative and career issues as their reasons for breaking up. Haigh will pursue a career as a composer, while Douglas will seek out other endeavours and White and Lowe have formed a new band, Novena, which will release the finished sophomore Bleeding Oath EP under their own name.
