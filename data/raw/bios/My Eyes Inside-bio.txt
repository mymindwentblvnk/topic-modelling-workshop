My Eyes Inside is a project that had been in development for two years before finally coming together in 2006.
Formed by musicians from different parts of Portugal, their music is a union of different styles and has influences that each member brings to the band's sound, basically mixing genres based on rock and metal.
Still in 2006, the group recorded an EP called Revelations, and after that, spent their time promoting their sound in the north of the country.
Now, while finishing the last wave of the "Revelations Tour", the band is composing new material for their debut album to be out still in 2008.
The band is formed by André Cordeiro on vocals, bassist Guilherme Lapa, Hélder Bernardo on guitar and drummer João Pires. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/My+Eyes+Inside">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
