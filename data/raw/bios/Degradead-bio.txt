Degradead took their chance and went down to Gothenburg and recorded their debut "Til Death Do Us Apart" in IF Studios. The album was produced by a team calling themselves H.O.R.D.E, mixed and engineered by Björn Gelotte and co-engineered by Jesper Strömblad and Daniel Svensson. Result of the recordings is a piece of Melodic Death Metal finding the perfect balance between Death Metal, Thrash Metal and catchy melodies, with their already very own signature. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Degradead">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
