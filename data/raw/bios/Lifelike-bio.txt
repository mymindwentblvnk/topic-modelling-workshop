As many lucky teenagers from the late 80s, Laurent Ash started as a bass player in a small High School band influenced by new-wave and pop music acts like Cabaret Voltaire, Frankie Goes To Hollywood or Simple Minds and discovered the art of sampling thru the first popular 8/16bits computers. 

Producing first for other artists in the early & mid 90s, he joined the parisian label 20000ST in 2001 (which was responsible for the hit single of Demon You Are My High) to release one of his first hit singles The Soul Of My Love , which features vocals performed by the NYC originated black icon Mandel Turner.

Massively playlisted by DJs like Alex Gopher and supported by the parisian radio FG, The Soul Of become in a few month the classic summer 2002 club anthem reaching place n°5 in the french dance charts. 

A few months later, the single Black Chess (The Cult EP A-side), a dark but dancefloor track, was choosen by Thomas Bangalter, Philippe Zdar & DJ Falcon for the famous Toghether 2002 Tour as their first record played in each gig, and became an anthem.

Remixing  for artists or labels like Annie, Belle, OT Quartet, Headbangers Rec., Demon or Sebastien Leger, helped Laurent to establish his trademark thru a very special kind of sound. His meeting with the german producer Christophe Hoeffel in winter 2004, ended up by the now famous track Discopolis: simply one of the biggest underground selling anthem of 2005/2006.

The track, picked up by Alan Braxe (one of the three guys that was behind the huge hit  Stardust Music Sounds Better With You) on his label Vulture, is now re-released on Defected with video support from Seb Janiak (Daft Punk Burnin) and new remixes Alan braxe, Chris Lake, and Kerri Chandler <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lifelike">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
