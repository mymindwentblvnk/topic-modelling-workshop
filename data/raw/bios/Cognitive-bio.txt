Formed in 2011, Cognitive are, despite their young history as a band, already a household name in the underground death metal scene. Having played in 11 states and shared stages with the likes of Macabre, Cattle Decapitation, Waking the Cadaver and Internal Bleeding, as well as self-released their debut EP, The Horrid Swarm, in July 2012, the band shows no signs of slowing down as of winter 2012. With their upcoming self-titled full-length, Cognitive will pick up where they left off with “The Horrid Swarm”, and deliver another release full of unmerciful technicality, pummeling grooves and vicious brutality. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cognitive">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
