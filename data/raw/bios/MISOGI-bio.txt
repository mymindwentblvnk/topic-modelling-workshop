MISOGI is a music producer from London, originally from Dubai, born February 14th, 1999. He started making EDM in 2012, until his side project drxp in 2014, which later became the main project called MISOGI. He changed his genre from project to project and pretty much workes in phases. His first project, OCCULT, was pretty dark and sample based, PINK2 was EDM and trap, PLAYMISOGI® was kinda industrial, while the newest EP, Death Metal, is all about the 80’s alternative rock, post punk, new wave and emo.

For rappers like Lil Yachty, AJ Tracey, Xavier Wulf, Bones, Chris Travis or Night Lovell he makes hip hop & trap beats but his own music is very different. He programs drums that sound real, plays his guitar and sings on his own songs. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Misogi">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
