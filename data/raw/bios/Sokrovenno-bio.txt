Sokrovenno was formed in the late 2005, when Autunno (bass and vocals) and Maleficus (guitar) found out their common interest in Classic Literature and Nature. Autunno started writing music.
In the early days of summer '06 they made a home-recorded demo called "Leggenda", but it lacked sound quality, thus they decided not to release it and yet went on fuelled by new enthusiasm.
In the Autumn of the same year, tha band gained Wartide at the rythm guitar and Sin at drums and perc. In the same time, Autunno's studies of Philosophy led him to join the tenets of the great Greek thinker Epicurus (IV-III Century b.C.).

With the new formation, some of the old stuff was re-arranged along with the new material.In February 2007, "Flammantia Moenia Mundi" (The Flaming Walls Of World) came to light. Some of the lyrics were inspired by the remarkable Roman and Epicurean author of the I Century b.C. Lucretius.

In Fall 2007 Sokrovenno enter Alpha & Omega studio with Alex Azzali to record their debut album "De Rerum Natura" (About The Nature Of Things). Once again inspired by the great Lucretius, the band intends to fuse Black Metal with classicism and philosophy with the aim to free the weak from the fear of a deterministic world.
The album will be published soon through Bleak Art Records.
