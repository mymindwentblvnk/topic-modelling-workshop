Esmerine is an experimental group started in 2003 by Bruce Cawdron and Beckie Foon, who have contributed to other Montreal-based bands as Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Set Fire to Flames, and A Silver Mt. Zion.

Esmerine's music consists mainly of percussion, cello, and marimba, lacking the guitars present in other Godspeed side-projects. Esmerine's style shares many characteristics with minimalist classical music, and chamber music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Esmerine">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
