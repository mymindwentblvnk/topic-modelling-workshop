The UK's South West Grindcore trio HUMAN CULL started off back in 2007 under the name GRAN TOUCHER.

After releasing two demos, an EP in June 2011 & featuring on countless underground compillations and gigging around the country in support of it, one final line up change made the band decide to lay the days of GRAN TOUCHER to rest and move on as a three piece with a set line up under the name HUMAN CULL.

2012 rolls in and now Edd, Morrish & Sam bring us the intense grinding music that is HUMAN CULL, delivering a rapid paced old school Grind & Crust mixed with some Power violence and the heaviest elements of 90's metallic Hardcore.

The band now on a steady rise have only gone from strength to strength travelling the UK delivering their aggressive raw energetic display that can only be held on par to the day's of Lee Doran's time with Napalm Death.

The band have gone on to support the likes of GRAVE DESECRATOR, BLACK BREATH, NAPALM DEATH, WORMROT, WITCH CULT, VULCANO & play at such iconic festivals such as the Blastonbury Festival.

2012 saw Human Cull release a new record 'Split Second Extinction' via Goatprayer Records. 

HUMAN CULL are a must for any old or new fan to the Grind Scene.
