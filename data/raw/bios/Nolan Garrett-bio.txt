Nolan was born to Sean and Marci Garrett on December 9, 1997 in Tacoma, WA. Nolan tried some summer sports activities as a young child, but came to the conclusion that, “sports are not my thing.” In February 2006 during second grade, Nolan was convinced to try a new activity that he might like outside of school. Because of an old, warped, nylon string guitar that was in the closet, he chose guitar lessons.
After begging not to go to his first lesson, he actually found that he enjoyed guitar. This was due in part to his fantastic guitar instructor, Daniel Harris. Ever since that day, Nolan has only excelled. Early the following year, after nearly six months of lessons, Nolan had his first taste of performing with a blues band. He played in front of approximately 200 people at the “Relay For Life” fundraiser in April 2006 and Nolan fell in love with performing and has yearned to continue. As he’s progressed over the last 4 years, He’s performed in three talent shows in elementary school, played with family friend Mike Schrum’s blues band at various venues, and two years ago (April 2008) he even performed for two nights on a Caribbean cruise ship! On March 20, 2010, he won both the solo and band divisions of the “KIDS GOT TALENT” Talent Show, presented by Puget Sound Music for Youth Association. His prize was studio time to record his original songs. This will provide a new opportunity for Nolan to hone his craft.

Nolan is currently a student at Mason Middle School and is in the jazz band. He continues to excel in academics with all A’s and is only getting faster and more motivated at guitar. If he continues down his current path, and maintains the level of commitment and hard work he has demonstrated, who knows how far he will go? The sky’s the limit. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nolan+Garrett">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
