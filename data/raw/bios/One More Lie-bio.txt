In 2005, One More Lie is founded by Ünsal Özata in contemplation of combining Swedish Death Metal / Metalcore genres and eastern tunes with a modern approach. Making its first concert appearance in Middle East Technical University’s “Metal Days” in 2006, One More Lie has been appreciated by energetic and enthusiastic stage performance with current line-up after several member changes. As yet, the band shared the stage with acts like Self Torture, False In Truth, Soul Sacrifice, Magick, Decaying Purity, Carnophage, Decimation, Tahrip and many others. 

In 2008 March, the debut EP “Chaos Reloaded” was recorded and engineered by Ünsal Özata. The cover artwork of the EP is designed by Daniel (Vildhjarta). The band is planning to record their debut full length album in summer 2008.
