Tokyo Sex Destruction consists of JC Sinclair, RR Sinclair, RJ Sinclair, and SF Sinclair (The Sinclair Family, whatever that means). It's not an easy task to define their sound: 60s garage rock meets soul, meets left winged political music, meets indie rock. The Band is from Barcelona, Spain.

The band is known by its productivity, since 2002 they have played more than 100 times per year, released three albums and 2 EP's. They're known across Europe, where they've become a referent of the European rock music. Although they come from Spain, they have had a huge success in France. 
Their first album was "Le Red Soul Communitee (10 points program)" in 2002. An electric work, where a garage-punk burst full of social proclams and an insolite audacity, which situated them overnight amongst the most attractive proposals of the Spanish musical panorama. This fact was determining for them, and they decided to dedicate themselves exclusively to the music. Later they released a vinil single, and in 2003 the EP "The big red box for the syndicate of emotions", edited also in Germany by Trans Solar.

In 2004 they released the splendid album "Black noise is the new sound", which untied a huge succes in France. Almost with no time between, in 2005 they released another disk, where they garage-punk evolved and got a bit darker, with some soul influences, and some psychodelic point, getting more interesting every time. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tokyo+Sex+Destruction">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
