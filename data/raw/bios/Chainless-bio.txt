Chainless (= Gonçalo Salgado, Lisbon) is this mystifying persona which we don’t know much about, his music ensemble revealed on his sound cloud strongly suggests a modern vision of what used to be called Witch House, mix it up with considerable doses of Post “Haunted” Dubstep you have some kind of celestial doom upon your ears.


Also produces music under the alias Lake Haze. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Chainless">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
