Subscaria is a Metal act from sweden.
 The name Subscaria is influenced by the deep (sub) scars after the invisible bloody wounds of long time psychological terror. In addition to the band name are many of the lyrics on the debut album also deeply influenced by the mood of "Subscaria".
Musically represents Subscaria a Swedish melodic growl metal that has its roots in the 80-90Â´s metal scene with influences from everything that sounds like music. It's very hard to put this kind of music in a particular genre. It simply sounds very Swedish. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Subscaria">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
