Gilgamesj was a Heavy Metal band from Leerdam, Netherlands, which was formed in 1975. They never really got really famous, although they certainly had potential, mainly because they didn't care about money or fame. 

Eventually, however, they had to get noticed by a recordlabel, and they did by a label called Rave On Records, where they released "Take One" in 1984, the only release which consisted purely of Gilgamesj songs.

Bandmembers:
Stanly Sanders
Hans Laponder
Frank van Stijn
Jan Vos
Gerrie den Hartog

Other releases that feature songs by Gilgamesj are;
1982 - Metal Clogs (Compilation LP)
1985 - Rave-on hits hard (Compilation LP) (song Daybreak)
1988 - Metal in Rocks pt. 1 (Compilation)
2004 - Heavy Metal Maniacs pt. 3 (Compilation 

The band split in 1997 but continues playing in a new outfit named Zixth Zense since 2001. The band reunited in 2010 and is playing live again!
