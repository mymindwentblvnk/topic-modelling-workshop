WOLFPACK UNLEASHED were formed in January 2005 by Daniel Haberl (Drums) and Wops Koch (Guitars), soon later to be completed by Karl Preininger (Guitars) and GÃ¼nther Wirth (Vocals).

WOLFPACK UNLEASHED shall stand for powerfull, cleverly arranged music, combining aggression and melody, excellent musicianship and musical quality - not fake images and underground Rockstar behaviour. This goal was achieved with their first CD , "The Art of Resistance", released in August 2006 and the Debut album "Anthems Of Resistance" out in September 2007.
