Waves of Amphitrite is a one-man epic metal project based in Elmhurst Illinois, USA at the helm of which stands founder Bryan A. Wysopal. The first E.P., The Wonders of the Fey-born Night was conceived of, written and recorded originally between 2004 and 2006 with additional corrections and re-recordings occuring during the spring and summer of 2009. The E.P. is currently expecting a small scale release early 2010. With the experience and practice acquired through the creation of this work, the first full length album, "A Window Facing Westward" was penned and is now nearing the stages of completion. The earlier pace of the project now picking up, new and exciting material is already in the works for the NEXT full length album. Each work promises to be more epic and over the top than the last! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Waves+of+Amphitrite">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
