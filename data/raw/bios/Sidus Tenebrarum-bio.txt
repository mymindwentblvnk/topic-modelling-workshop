2001 the "SIDUS" was born by the hands of "BELLOZ" (drums) and "SANTA" (guitars) in Pordenone(IT). They started to compose the first songs inspired by the old 80â€™ school and the violence of true black metal. 2002 "GIULIO" (screams) and DEZO (bass) joined the SIDUS and the band composed the first demo called" SIDUS TENEBRARUM", 3 tracks for 11 minutes of raw hate.
