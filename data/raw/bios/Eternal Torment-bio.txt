Eternal Torment is a death metal band hailing from the Gold Coast. The band was formed with the sole purpose of creating uncompromising death metal. Weaving technical guitar riffs, relentless drumming, pounding bass lines and truly ferocious vocals to create a devastating fully automatic assault. The band plans on spreading their signature-style brutality with live shows planned across Australia.

********************************************************************************************************************

The now defunct Eternal Torment was a grindcore band from Buffalo New York that lasted from 1992 to 1996. Formed by Al Costa, (bass, vocals- former Arsenic Disposal, Immortal Terror), Dan Nelligan, (drums- former Putrefest, Skungk, 5 years gone, presently in Stemm), and Carl Pace, (guitars- formerly Arsenic Disposal, Immortal Terror, Putrefest, 5 years gone, Plus Seven Long Sword, Alpha Male, presently in The Beta Cloud, Golden Dawn Trio, and other projects). The line up was a part of the then powerful Buffalo/Niagara Falls/Rochester grind/thrash/death scene. The scene then was unimaginally huge and strong. Local shows alone would yield in excess of 300 hardcore warriors at such venues as The Skyroom, The River Rock, Randalls, and The Penny Arcade. The "scene" was a support group for abused, neglected, and frustrated street kids. There was no fashion code, very little infighting. It was all about getting in the pit and working off your depression. Brothers and sisters in arms. The bands were especially close, other local faves like Infestation, Beyond Death, Carnal Dissection, Grotesque Infection, Cannibal Corpse, Baphomet, Putrefest, and too many more to mention would share their plate, bed and soul with one another. The guys in Eternal Torment were graced to have shared the stage with such amazing bands as- Carcass, Death, Godflesh, Entombed, Cannibal Corpse, Cathedral, Napalm Death, Grave, Massacre, Nocturnus, Immolation, Mortician, Incantation, Old Lady Drivers, and many, many more. So where are they now? Carl Pace now does an ambient project called The Beta Cloud, and perform on occasion with The Golden Dawn Trio, as well as in avant Jazz/experimental outfits. Dan Nelligan now plays in the brutal Metal band Stemm, Al Costa is now a devout father and husband.
