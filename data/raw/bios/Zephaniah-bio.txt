Zephaniah was introduced to music at a very young age. With an influence of pop, soul, jazz, Broadway and classical music, Zephaniah was taking in every musical aspect that touched his ear. Zephaniah started off by leading his Father’s church choir at the age of six. He traveled with his father’s choir to different Competitions across the country.
 
At a very young age, Zephaniah knew exactly what he wanted to do for the rest of his life. “I remember as a young child staying closed up in my room, recording vocals with cassette players, using anything in my room for drums. And once I recorded all the vocals, I would perform in arenas (my room) in front of an audience (my toys) and gave my all. I would do a concert everyday in a “different city”. In my mind, it was the greatest tour. I did costume changes as well”
