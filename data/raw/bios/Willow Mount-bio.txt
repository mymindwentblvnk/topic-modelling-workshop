Willow Mount has released (as of 12 January 2010) one CD called Vanitas. On their myspace page, they only have this to say about who they are as a band: 

"Most assuredly, I say to you that you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice; and you will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will be turned to joy."
