Ultraphallus exists since 2002. Created in Liège, Belgium by Phil Maggi and Gabriel Marguerie, during sessions of dark-ambient combo Eve and the Sickness.

“Band’s name Ultraphallus is a homage and the real name given to Michael Jackson’s father, Joe Jackson, who raped and educated his children hardly...Joe Jackson is the Ultimate Father...For All, he IS the Ultraphallus.” 

In 2004, the band released U.1, a first 4 tracks demo.

In 2006, release of Lungville, distributed by Conspiracy Records. In November of that same year, Ultraphallus took part of the Suma tour for fifteen gigs in Europe.

In 2008, release of the album The Clever, recorded in Liège during five days, engineered and mixed in January with John Roo and Snoninovitch. 

"Ultraphallus sent us their self-produced cd and we knew immediately we had to carry it. Belgian Hypnotic noise-rock with hints to Sleep and the Melvins. Some awesome headbanging dirge."
