Mass in Comatose is a three-piece death metal act from Tallinn, Estonia that plays old-school death metal with a playfully experimetal edge. The birth of the band was in early 2007, when Sorts, having parted ways with Nihilistikrypt, sought to set up his own project recruiting Ove from Aeon Aethereal to fulfill the duties of lead guitar. During the summer of 2007 Siim, the bass player (Cramp, ex-DNR) was found via an online add. Many applicants were auditioned for the vocalist position including Aeon Aethereal's vocalist Ott Kadak, but due to lack of time he didn't have time to commit to the project but contributetd the lyrics for "Control the Masses" He also appears on the album in the form of guest vocals. Instead, Siim took on the vocal duties as well and the initial line up was complete.

In early 2008 recording began on the MCD release "Sempiternal Nightmare Industry" with Thonolan (Urt) filling the session drummer spot, the release date of which is scheduled for sometime in 2009.
