There are two well-known artists known as "CMA":


--

1. The first one is a 19 year old electronic music producer from Holland. He started his journey into creating music at the age of 12. Pursuing a lifelong passion, he mainly produces chillout electronic music filled with warm and gentle sounds. He thinks that you don't necessarily need the use of words to express emotions, but music on its own shares enough.

Some of his best works:
''You're Not Alone''
''You're Free''
''Without You''
''Small Losses''

2. The second one is a hip-hop group, also known as The CMA or California Music Authority or the Cool Man Association, comprises Living Legends crew members Luckyiam and The Grouch. After many collaborations over the years, the two felt their styles and way of thinking would work together as a side project and CMA was formed. CMA is a chance for Lucky and the Grouch to touch on topics and styles that they otherwise might not cover. The debut CMA project Overall dropped in 1998, generating critical acclaim and an enthusiastic fan base. Their latest project, the highly anticipated All Over album (November 2004), solidifies the two as a legitimate force on their own. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/CMA">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
