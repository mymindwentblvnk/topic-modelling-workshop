One of the most known and popular, though not best, hardcore bands of Turkey. Before putting an end to their 11 years of musical career in 2003 they released two full lenght albums, New World Order Sucks (1995), and Suffer Hits (2000). Former one more Thrash and Death Metal than anything "core", the latter was not free of those anyway, which sounds Crossover, as they were mostly influenced from Sepultura and Suicidal Tendencies, and other bands ranging between thrash, punk and death metal. Among their two albums, there is only one song that is Turkish. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Antisilence">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
