There are two artists that go by the name of 'Laïs' or 'Lais': 1. A Flemish folk group. 2. An R&B singer and rapper based in Toronto.

1. Laïs is a Flemish folk group featuring the voices of Jorunn Bauweraerts, Nathalie Delcroix and Annelies Brosens. The inspiration for their songs comes from old song books. Their style can best be described as a modern take on medieval songs.

The band was formed at the music workshop Volksmuziekstages in Gooik, Belgium. The well-established Flemish folk band Kadril noticed the girls singing a capella and took them on tour as their support act.  While touring with Kadril Laïs built up a small fan base with their a capella songs. Their first CD featured appearances by Kadril, but later the girls would find their own musicians to complete the band. Today Jorunn, Nathalie and Annelies are joined by Fritz Sundermann (electric and acoustic instruments, harmonium), Hans Quaghebeur (squeezeboxes, hurdy-gurdy, whistle), Ronny Reuman (percussion) and Bart Denolf (electric and acoustic bass).

2. Lais is a Canadian R&B singer and rapper, who stormed onto the scene via Reddit’s HipHopHeads when his first mixtape Session One went viral on the platform. After deciding to dive into producing and songwriting as a way to pass the time while being on house arrest he rediscovered his love & passion for music & fashion. Born in Pakistan, but having moved to Virginia at the age of 3 and again to Toronto at the age of 13, Lais has been able to tap into a unique variety of cultures, aesthetics, and sounds from his own life experiences all while telling his story. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/La%C3%AFs">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
