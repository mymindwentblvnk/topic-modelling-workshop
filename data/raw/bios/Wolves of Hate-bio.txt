More than 1000 years after the northmen discovered America, the vikings return to Vinland. WOLVES OF HATE was formed in the cold winter of 2006 by Peter Slivkanch (Guitars, Vocals, Keys and Warmarches), Rodd Hamann (Guitars), and Scott Schultz (Bass). Hailing from Colorado, USA and armed with guitars rather than axes, their assault is no less barbaric.

Their debut CD "BATTLE HYMNS AND WAR SONGS" is a well produced, fast paced, and brutal onslaught of bloodlust and fury. "BATTLE HYMNS AND WAR SONGS" is just as the name implies, the soundtrack to epic battles, the stories of the brave who have fallen, and the celebration of victory.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wolves+of+Hate">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
