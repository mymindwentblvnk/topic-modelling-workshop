Bio: 
1) Aphorism’s Josh Pyle is no stranger to electronic music. Drawn to the darker end of its spectrum in the early 90’s, Josh spent years in the Industrial music scene. Involved in a number of projects, Josh relocated from Texas to Chicago in 2000. With a music background spanning well over 15 years, Josh’s project Aphorism began to take shape in 2005. 

Although obsessed with the ability to create physically impossible sounds while driving his equipment to the edge, Josh never lost his love for post punk and Wax-Trax! era electronic dance music. With inspirations ranging from Berlin Electro to Skinny Puppy; from Amon Tobin to Dub, the combination of stylistic influences plus an interest in 60’s and 70’s European soundtracks, all contribute to the Aphorism sound. 

Aphorism joins Tympanik Audio for his incredibly dynamic debut album release titled ‘Surge‘, featuring remixes by Totakeke, Access To Arasaka, and Tapage, slated for CD release on March 23rd, 2009. In the meantime, you can find a new and exclusive track by Aphorism on Tympanik Audio’s recent compilation release ‘Emerging Organisms 2‘

2) Aphorism is a band from Salvador, Bahia, Brazil. With influences from black metal, death metal, grindcore and crust, released their first EP in June 2014. The EP "I" can be downloaded at http://aphorismkvlt.bandcamp.com/
