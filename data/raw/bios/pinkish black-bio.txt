Pinkish Black is a duo from Forth Worth, Texas. After the bands Yeti, The Great Tyrant, The Pointy Shoe Factory, Maxine's Radiator, and many others, Daron Beck and Jon Teague formed Pinkish Black out of the emotional pain endured as a result of the suicide of their close friend, Tommy Wayne Atkins. This band is dedicated to keeping it real and from the heart.

Their debut LP was released on Handmade Birds. They have also released another 12", titled "Razed To The Ground," in 2013.
