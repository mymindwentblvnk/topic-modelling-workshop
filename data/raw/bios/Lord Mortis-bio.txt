Lord Mortis were a Canadian Death Metal band formed out of Rimouski, Quebec. The band was formed in 1991, broke up in 1996 and left behind 2 demo tapes. The first, a self-titled demo, was released in 1992 and contained 4 tracks. The second, called 'Bridge Between The Shores', was released in 1995. 'Bridge Between The Shores' was recorded at Studio Victor in Montreal under the guidance of Pierre Remillard of the band Obliveon. Both demos were released and distributed independently. In 2004 the band released a DVD which captured footage from 6 different live shows (2 from 1993 and 4 from 1995). This release was also taken care of in an independent fashion. It is also worth noting that the band's logo was created by Dan Seagrave, who is responsible for many significant album covers amongst the early Death Metal scene (Entombed, Benediction, Dismember, Morbid Angel, Nocturnus...). It is unknown whether or not the band members went on to join any other significant groups. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lord+Mortis">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
