Akua Carson is a Canadian singer-songwriter and producer who has straddled the lines between R&B, electronic and pop when it comes to making music over the years. 

Having already sparked musical comparisons to Rhye and Jessie Ware, and having opened for Katy B, Solange and  Cody ChesnuTT, it’s safe to say that AKUA’s career as a solo artist is off to a promising start. 

While her introduction to live music began as a timid backup singer during college, deep down, AKUA had her heart set on a solo project from the moment she stepped on stage. Yet it would take hours of tinkering alone in her bedroom and a brief (but weird) stint singing at a luxury Middle Eastern hotel-bar for AKUA to overcome her self-doubt and hash-out the unique sound she's come to possess. 

Deciding early on to defy the conventional mold of “singer-songwriter,” AKUA took an interest in music production right away and took to working with production software, loop pedals and vocal effects to curate her sound. 

What emerged from this musical exploration was a variety of raw and deeply personal songs and soundscapes which AKUA would further develop with the help of producers & multi-instrumentalists Andy Bauer (of Twin Shadow) & Martin Rodriguez.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Akua">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
