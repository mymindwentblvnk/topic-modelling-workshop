Searing Meadow was founded in summer 1999 when two friends, M.Ikonen & V.Pekkala, had a desire to play brutal and aggressive death metal. After a few months they met V.Korhonen who shared the same kind of musical interest and joined the band as a bass player. The only thing missing was a good drummer, which was very hard to find in a small town like Turku. Finally in summer 2000 they got themselves a great drummer when A.Hakkala joined the band.

The band released three self-financed demos between 2000 and 2002 after they signed a record deal with Finnish label called Rising Realm Records. The bandâ€™s debut album was recorded in Turku at Noise Camp Studios in May 2004. Finally in July 2005 their debut album Corroding From Inside will hit the stores in Europe (USA release was in March 2005).

Searing meadow has nowadays five members. Sasu Haapanen joined the band as a third guitarist in late 2004 and Mr. Ikonen will concentrate more on vocals in the future.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Searing+Meadow">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
