Nuclear Hellfrost is a black metal group from Fort Wayne, Indiana, their tracks also influenced by crust music and hardcore punk. Their name is a reference to the 'atomic freezing' or 'nuclear winter' theory discussed by the late Carl Sagan and other scientists, who feared that a new world war could result in so much nuclear destruction that the sun becomes blocked out and lands begin to freeze. The band picked up major attention in early 2015 when former vocalist Reece Eber vandalized the grave of Pantera's Dimebag Darrell; numerous music fans and Nuclear Hellfrost's other members condemned Eber's actions, the group stating that they in no way support anti-gay remarks or other forms of hatred. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nuclear+Hellfrost">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
