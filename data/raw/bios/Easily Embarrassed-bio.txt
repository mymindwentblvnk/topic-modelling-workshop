The Dutch brothers Van der Schilden and Peter Spaargaren have been exploring musical emotions with deep, atmospheric layers since 2006, forming the electronic act ‘Easily Embarrassed’. Combining various styles and flavors, from electro to ambient and from dub to psychedelic, they blend retro synthesizing with today’s sounddesign.

Hailing from the EE Studio in Aalsmeer, Holland, they’ve already earned their marks releasing 2 free EP’s “From Sunset Last Night to Sunrise This Morning” and “Darkened Emotion”. Easily Embarrassed moved on from there, leaving the demo scene behind when they released their debut album “Idyllic Life” on Cardamar Music. The up- and downtempo flows of ‘Easily Embarrassed’ has developed strongly over the years, not afraid to venture into the unknown, but always staying true to their own, distinct sound.
