2. Nova Prospect is a six-piece Melodic Death Metal outfit from the Ohio, United States of America. The band was formed in early 2007 by founding members Cory Waugh (bass) and Doug Hodges (guitar) and has gone through a few grueling member changes before solidifying the current line-up in June 2008. After months of writing new material the band entered the studio in October 2008 to begin tracking their debut album "Usurper" at Sacred Sound Studios in Martin's Ferry, Ohio and offer their first testament to heavy metal.
