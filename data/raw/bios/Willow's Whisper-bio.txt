How it began… 

The tale of Willow’s Whisper starts in 2000, when Nele (keyboard) en Bart (guitar) decide te make some music together. Two was not enough and they asked Kristof, Nele’s brother, to play the bass. He said yes, provisional, till they found another, but he stayed. Kimme took the microphones and a drummer was found in Karel. Sam was asked to be the second guitarist, but a few months later Bart quit the band. This five are now Willow’s Whisper. They had a few try outs with second guitarists – Wouter and Wim – but for several reasons this didn’t work uit.
