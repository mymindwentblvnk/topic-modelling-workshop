For Selena and Sin was a melodic metal band, founded in Finland in 2004. The band currently consists of Annika Jalkanen (female vocals),  Pasi Kolari (guitars), Martti Pohjosaho (guitars), Teemu Turkia (bass), Teemu Oksanen (keyboards), and Kuha Sillanmäki (drums).

Performing an unique mixture of metal, rock and pop, For Selena and Sin have had their distinctive sound right from the beginning. Already with their first demo (Draining, 2005) the band showed such potential that it wasn’t a great surprise when a record deal with dutch Mascot Records was signed.

In 2007 For Selena and Sin recorded their debute album Overdosed on You in Studio Watercastle with producer Arttu Sarvanne.. The album was highly praised by media in Finland and abroad, and it received several “album of the month “ titles. After the album being released, the Selenas wasted no time getting themselves on the road. Intensive touring through Finland, Europe and Russia made sure the band became known by the great public.

Year 2009 saw For Selena and Sin head to Studio Underground in Västerås, Sweden, to record their second album Primrose Path. Collaboration with producer Pelle Saether brought up a more energetic and diverse side of For Selena and Sin. The new masterpiece features 12 catchy songs, including Kylie Minoque cover song Confide in Me. Also a music video was shot over the first single, Psycho Lover.

Split up in 2011. Annika Jalkanen, Martti Pohjosaho and Aapeli Kivimäki went on to form Cold Hour.
