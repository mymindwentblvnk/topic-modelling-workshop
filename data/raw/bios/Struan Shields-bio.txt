Singer/song writer Struan Shields hails from Arlington County, Virginia where he's starting to create quite the stir, sharing stage bills with other upcoming talent in the form of pop-rockers Sing Me Insomnia, fellow singer/songwriter Chase Coy, power-poppers The Hint and Shields' good friends; Indie-rock outfit The Downtown Fiction. Struan prides himself on his DIY ethic, choosing to write and record his songs at home and he also keeps a close relationship with his ever-increasing fan base, regularly communicating with them via various social networking sites and even offering a personal phone call for anyone who pre-orders the EP.
