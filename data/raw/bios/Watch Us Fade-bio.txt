Watch Us Fade was formed in 2011, with Luke Watson and Joe Spencer on guitars, Connor Sanders on vocals and Oli Mullins on drums. Soon after the formation, Connor was hospitalized after a kidney failure; so work started in early 2012. After numerous lineup changes, Jack Crooke joined as a guitarist whilst Joe went onto play bass. 

The band released self produced EP on the 22nd September 2012; titled "Into the Fade". After this; the band had a change of genre and adopted heavier guitar riffs, deeper and more powerful vocals and more of a unified stage presence. 

On 6th October, Watch Us Fade played their last gig with Oli Mullins on drums, whom departed the band in order to go to Bangor University. Cassius Hewitt-Dudding was then recruited onto drums.

On the 4th November, Luke Watson left the band due to a lack of enthusiasm for metal music. Soon thereafter, Tom Phillips joined as guitarist. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Watch+Us+Fade">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
