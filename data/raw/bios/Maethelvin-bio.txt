From Nantes, west coast of France, comes a guy that calls himself Maethelvin (pronounced "Ma-e-tel-vine").  

Maethelvin’s project was initiated in 2007. Fascinated by digital sound, he provides a perfect sound-track for car-chasing and TV shows from the 80’s, falling somewhere between forgotten Italo-disco melodies, and Jan Hammer’s soundtracks. As a DJ, Maethelvin is providing well-powered DJ sets, from italo-disco to future-disco, reviewing 20 years of creation in electronic music, with a strong dancefloor feeling.

He appears on the Valerie and friends compilation with the track Lost In Big City. His songs can be found on his myspace page. Check it out.
