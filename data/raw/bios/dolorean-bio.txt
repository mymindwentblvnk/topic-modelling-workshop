The band started off in bars and cafes around Portland, Oregon with singer-songwriter Al James performing songs as Dolorean. It picked up speed after he teamed up with Jay Clarke and the two began to perform as a duo. Al on the guitar and Jay on a student piano. The resulting work was considered album worthy. So, with the help of The Standard's Robbie Duncan on drums Dolorean cut its first album on CDR in 2000.

Since then Al James and Jay Clarke have worked together to create four subsequent albums: "Not Exotic", in 2002, " Violence in the Snowy Fields", in 2004, "You Can't Win" in 2007, and ''The Unfazed'', in 2011, all with help from various friends from in and around Portland. Recently Dolorean covered Elliott Smith's "The Biggest Lie" on, "To: Elliott, From: Portland"". They released their final single ''Miami Wine'' in 2014. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dolorean">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
