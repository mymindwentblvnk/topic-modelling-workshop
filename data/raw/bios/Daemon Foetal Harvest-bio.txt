DAEMON FOETAL HARVEST was conceived in early 2006, by the two founding members, guitarists, Alex and Keith. Heavily influenced by old and new school death metal, Daemon Foetal harvest is a blend of viciously twisted rhythms, subtle melodic overtones and intricate lead work.

The band then underwent a series of lineup changes, until cementing the current line up of Rod on bass, Craig (BATTALION) on vocals, Daniel “KINGSLAYER” (SECRATAIN, PESTILENTIAL SHADOWS, THE FUROR) on drums, and Alex and Keith on guitars. DFH quickly entered the studio to record a five track EP. The result, Abducted and Compacted, an exceptional debut release. A unique fusion of melodic and neo-death metal, with a distinct Australian flavor. Insane vocals, warped rhythms, complex melodic leads and perverse over the top lyrics, jam-packed into five chaotic tracks.

The end of 2006 saw the departure of drummer, Daniel, due to interstate commitments (musical and otherwise), which delayed the release of the EP. DFH decided to forge on and embrace technology, performing their debut gig with a drum machine at the Palm Court Hotel early this year supporting international band, Nervecell, and local Australian giants, The Furor, on the Road Rage Tour.
