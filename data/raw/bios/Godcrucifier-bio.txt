Godcrucifier is a Death Doom Metal band from Italy. They were formed in late 1991, as "Infernal Angel".
A Death/Black/Grind Metal band extremely rough, released only a demo, “Mega Satanic Holocaust”.

After few months, the name was changed into Godcrucifier. A second tape, called “Infernal Demoniac Satanism”, was recorded – it sounded better than the previous one. These tapes were never officially released.

The real Godcrucifier story begins in 1993, when Lorenzo (Vocals) and  Paolo (Guitar) changed all the band members and the sound – from Death to Melodic Death/Doom. First the "Promo Tape 1993", and then the demo “Jerusalem” were released (1994): the last one was a successful tape, which spread the bands name around. Together with Lorenzo & Paolo, were Alessio (Bass), Federico (Drums) and Luca (Guitar).

In 1995 Paolo and Alessio left the band, and formed "Kind of Unexpected". The demo “Alien Sun” was recorded, but this release had no success, due to a poor promotion. A pause was needed, and it lasted almost two years.

In 1997 Lorenzo called Paolo and Luca and gave life to another chapter in Godcrucifier's history: the band name was Godcrucifier again, and they  recorded the new demo “Intergalactic Christ”, a come back to certain Melodic Death atmospheres with minor Black Metal influences.

In 1999: Lorenzo began to work on some new tracks, but, due to the very different style (gothic/electronic/wave), decided to release them with another band, called Syrian. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Godcrucifier">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
