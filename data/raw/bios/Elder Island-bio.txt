Bristol based triad pigeoned in d.i.y. / r&b / pop / electronic / dance music.

A mixture of jiving mpc beats, alongside a myriad of effected keys, guitar, bass and cello is set off by an overlay of soulful female and male vocals.

Soft rolling noise and catchy melodies makes for many formats of ethereal sound scapes with a draw string of gyrating drops that pulls all together to form a collection of loose structured ‘move your mind and feet’ pop songs. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Elder+Island">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
