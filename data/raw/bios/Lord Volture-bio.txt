‘The majesty of a lordship, the power and velocity of an electrical charge and the beastly ruggedness of a scavenging vulture’

LORD VOLTURE are a Dutch heavy metal outfit in the tradition of Judas Priest, Iron Maiden and Iced Earth, led by vocalist David Marcelis. After an explosive take-off in 2010 with the release of debut album ‘Beast of Thunder’ (feat. Jeff Waters of Annihilator) the band rapidly rose to find themselves in the frontier of the Dutch heavy metal scene. With their follow-up releases ‘Never Cry Wolf’ (feat. Sean Peck of Cage) in 2011 and “Will to Power” (Mausoleum Records, feat. Chris Poland, ex-Megadeth) in 2014 the band set their definitive style while increasingly gaining recognition everywhere they were heard. With all three albums being well received by reviewers worldwide, LORD VOLTURE have gained significant presence in the global metal community. This massive exposure opened doors to many festivals and support slots. As a result, LORD VOLTURE have shared the stage with Y&T, Primal Fear, Firewind, Sanctuary, Circle II Circle, Tim Ripper Owens, Blaze Bayley, Vicious Rumors, Blitzkrieg and numerous others, while touring through the larger part of Europe. From the British Isles to eastern Europe and from the Baltics to the Mediterranean, LORD VOLTURE have made their mark. Now, with a new line-up, LORD VOLTURE are sharper than ever before and ready to unleash more high-pitched power vocals, mind boggling guitar solos and pure unpolished heavy metal onto the world. For all who bear a heart of steel, LORD VOLTURE is a definite MUST!
