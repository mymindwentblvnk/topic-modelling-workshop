Whichheaven was founded in 1997 by two guitarists: Dzeju and Michal in Warsaw, Masovia Poland . They have gigged and recorded in various line ups and are still looking for a distribution deal with plans to release various sessions recorded over the past few years.

Their influences as artists are typically symphonic black metal ala Dimmu Borgir, but their sound is a little more Annihilator than Emperor, relying a little more on power metal and thrash influences. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Whichheaven">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
