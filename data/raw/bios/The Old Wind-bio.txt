1) TOW / The Old Wind
A band created by former BREACH vocalist Tomas Liljedahl (previously Hallbom).
Debut album “Feast On Your Gone” to be released on Pelagic Records in April 2013.
Liljedahl wrote all songs as well as played every instrument on the album.

Originally incepted as a studio project, Liljedahl soon realized that these rough,
abrasive songs needed to be performed live, with a real band.
And so he teamed up with his former BREACH band mates Niklas Quintana (guitar)

and Kristian Andersson (bass guitar), added drummer Karl Daniel Lidén (VAKA)
to the line-up and asked Robin Staps of Pelagic Records / The Ocean to join on 3rd guitar.

This album is the first sign of life of a band which consists of old veterans
of the European heavy music scene – still, a juvenile band that has not yet played
a single live show!
“Rehearsals are scheduled for May 2013, and everyone of us is really pumped
to get this going”, says Liljedahl.
