Merankorii was born in the beginning of 2004 in Portugal as a side project of Mind Booster Noori, a tentative form of cultural art with a melancholic and depressive touch of a reality injection to a body who had no more hope of living. It soon evolved into what could have become quite a schizophrenic movie but, instead, turned into "Doom Poetry from a Melancholic Soul".
