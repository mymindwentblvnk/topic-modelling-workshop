Ricky Bailey & Delegation... delivering all that's great about British 70's, 80's & 90's Soulful Funk!

Delegation one of the foremost recording and touring soul funk bands of the 70's, 80's and 90's with a string of chart hits in the UK, all over Europe and the US.  

The band that recorded "Where Is The Love" (We Used To Know) and featured on the then, leading music TV programme in the UK, "Top Of The Pops" which also arrived on UK screens on Thursday nights was the only TV place to be to catch the UK chart scene, in fact if you were going out you wouldn't go out until you had seen TOP!

Still working hard at his craft with his soulful, rich vocals and masterful leadership... Ricky is a man with a mission and as he comments, "There's unfinished business".
