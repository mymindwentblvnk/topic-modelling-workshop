TRAVAIL writes songs with a conscience. their music comes from the heart and soul of each
member. their journey began when MATT LESLIE and DANIEL MCKAY decided to form a 
band that could serve as a role model for the kids who felt disillusioned with popular heavy 
music. playing any venue they could in the dallas/fort worth area, TRAVAIL released there 
first cd, "ANCHOR OF MY SOUL". after building a solid fan base in the dallas/fort worth area, 
TRAVAIL found themselves tested with the departure of their gutiar and bass players. not 
knowing how to continue, they called upone their faith. coming to the terms that music 
was their calling, they decided to regroup with friends BRIAN HOOVER(guitarist) and 
DUANE SMITH(bassist) to continue what TRAVAIL had started in the DFW area. TRAVAIL 
continued their ambition to play whenever and wherever they could, gaining new fans 
at every performance. they also had the priveledge to tour up and down the EAST COAST 
and MIDWEST. also got to play such festivals as: TEXAS ROCKFEST and TEXAS TOMFEST. 
their devotion to playing live has ensured them a reputation of being hard workers. the 
press has even turned an eye on TRAVAIL, with HM MAGAZINE featuring the band as a 
premiere up and coming band. the track "LIES" attracted national and international 
interest in TRAVAIL after being featured on an HM MAGAZINE SAMPLER CD.

the album entitled "BEAUTIFUL LONELINESS" is 13 tracks of hardcore 
metal with a hip-hop flavor. it includes the bands previous demo 
material produced and remixed by BARRY POYNTER (LIVING SACRIFICE, ZAO). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Travail">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
