Celestial Shore's debut EP California Eden clocks in at four tracks in seven minutes flat. In that brief span, it shifts gears recklessly between its multithreaded, intensely melodic motifs - the collected effect is one of gunning your '41 woody straight off the pier, smack through the loop-de-loop, and out into the surf. The Brooklyn-based trio followed this EP with the Place Aux Dames 7" on Double Denim Records, and late last year released a four-song all-analog split tape with Shopping Spree on Prison Art.
 
Celestial Shore will release their debut full-length record entitled 10x on Brad Oberhofer's Local Singles Records on April 23. Mixed by Greg Saunier (Deerhoof), 10x expands on the band's earlier outings with more fully-developed song structures, offering more room to employ its growing bag of tricks – the odd beat dropped here or there, muscly breakneck spazzouts, and ecstatic wind-up reveries that immediately distinguish their sound and feel. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Celestial+Shore">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
