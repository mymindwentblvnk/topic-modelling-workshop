Belathuzur was the Black Metal solo project of former Mütiilation's drummer Krissagrazabeth. The band's name was Belathauzer but the demos were widely bootlegged/shared under the name Belathuzur in the years since the band became inactive, with an image of Krissagrazabeth taken from Mütiilation's "Satanist Stryken" demo. 

Unlike someone may say, Belathuzur has nothing to do with Satanicum Tenebrae (dark ambient project of Meyhna'ch), they were two totally different project. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Belathuzur">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
