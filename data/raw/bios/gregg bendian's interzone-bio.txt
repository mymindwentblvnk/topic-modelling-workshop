Percussionist/composer Gregg Bendian is an unusual character: a musician with serious free jazz credentials who also professes a fondness for 1970's-style progressive rock. Regardless of musical category, Gregg Bendian's Interzone is a phenomenal ensemble. Bendian handles the vibes and glock on Interzone's Myriad, with Alex Cline and Steuart Liebig ably navigating the leader's charts on drums and bass. Nels Cline, Alex's brother and one of today's finest electric guitar improvisors, rounds out the quartet. While the Pierre Moerlen ensemble of nearly a quarter-century ago ultimately fell prey to many of the same stylistic missteps that afflicted other '70s fusionists, Gregg Bendian's Interzone makes no compromises for the sake of commercial appeal in a jazz market now largely split between soft and retro. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gregg+Bendian%27s+Interzone">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
