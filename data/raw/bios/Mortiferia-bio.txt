Mortiferia was founded in early 2007 in Skien, a city in the south-east part of Norway. A local band called Nèmesis was searching for members to fullfill their line-up. Meanwhile, a few members of a local black/folk metal band called Sectum were eager to start something on the symphonic front. Per Ivar from Nèmesis got in contact with the guys from Sectum, namely Joakim, Herman and Bård, and shortly thereafter, they were a part of Nèmesis, which also consisted of drummer Kenneth and vocalist Frøya. Tarjei and Tom Willy, the previous guitarist and keyboardist of Nèmesis, had decided to leave his band due to various reasons.

Mortiferia has composed music in the style of symphonic metal, and in July 2007, they recorded their first EP, containing 7 tracks, though unfortunately under poor conditions.

At the end of the same month, the band parted ways with Per Ivar due to musical and professional disagreements. They also wanted to incorporate more extreme and folk elements to their sound, and when Bård Bergby, the vocalist in Sectum, quit the band to focus more on another band of his, it was natural to fuse the two bands together, abandoning the Sectum name and logo, but keeping the songs alive under the name Mortiferia. The band has always led into directions of it's own due to it's wide musical specter.
