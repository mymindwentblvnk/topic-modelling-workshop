This is a band from Northampton, PA - made up of prep school boyz and carnies, a band that shouldn't exist but somehow does.  With incisive odes to paranoia, dysentery, and Colt 45, you'll wonder how such an entity has come into being.  These guys play heavy because it's in their blood!

Current Members:

Jason West - Lead Guitar
Justin Dottor - Bass, Backing Vocals
Terry Payne - Lead Vocals
Blake Wohrmann - Drums
Bryan Ferencz - Rhythm Guitar
