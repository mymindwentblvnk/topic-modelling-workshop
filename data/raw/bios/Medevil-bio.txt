Medevil is a highly energetic, fast-paced metal band known for their tight songwriting, intense stage presence and roaring vocals. They are one of the few metal bands coming out of Chilliwack BC, Canada and hold that title proud as they have earned much praise and respect since their inception in 2014. 

Their music could be described as "power thrash" with half of their set being chorus-driven, and the other half focusing on blistering fast riffs.

Conductor of Storms, their debut album, was released in 2016. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Medevil">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
