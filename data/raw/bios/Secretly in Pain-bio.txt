Secretly in Pain was a depressive black metal band from Quebec (Canada), formed in 2007 by Marthym and Morbid. After recording two, so far unreleased, demos the band began working on a full length with the title Fuck this Life. This album, released in 2008 on tape, would be their first official release. 
After, Morbid was removed from the line-up by Marthym and a new line-up was created as B.G., Marco and Mond joined the band. Plans were made for a rerecording of Fuck this Life, as well as a second full length. The band signed to Pest Productions but before any plans were realised the band was put on hold, only to become active again after a few months. However, no new releases were made and the band's current status remains unknown.
