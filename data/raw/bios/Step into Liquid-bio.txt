2002 STEP INTO LIQUID came into being. The band from hamburg (germany) emerged out of MEGACE - well known for their special style of progressive metal with female vocals.
Now the five musicans of SIL follow a different path. Clearly more transparent than in the earlier days, the music flows between rock and metal. The style is marked by surprising compositions, being understandable and catchy at the same time.
Getting fluent – the chosen meaning of the name – expresses also the act of melting the different styles, brought in by the musicians, into one another. 

Home on stage and traveling the world with their songwriting - one way to describe
STEP INTO LIQUID.
Various assosiations, emotions ranging from melancholic moods to aggression -- that's TRAFFIC IN MY HEAD -- the first longplayer off  STEP INTO LIQUID from Hamburg, Germany.
Their style is placed somewhere between rock and metal hitting the mark of ear and heart. What has been indicated in 2004 with the MaxiCD FIRST STEPS is consequently lead on by TRAFFIC IN MY HEAD.
One cannot deny the past of the five musicians! Too deep are their roots - four of them were long members of MEGACE, the band STEP INTO LIQUID was emerging from. Creative guitars meeting a rock solid rythmfraction and together with the many-faceted vocals, STEP INTO LIQUID are even more present than before! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Step+Into+Liquid">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
