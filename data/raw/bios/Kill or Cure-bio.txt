Kill or Cure released their debut album in January 2014 to critical acclaim. Full of crushing metal anthems, it's a rare mix of groove, aggression and melody, combining powerhouse vocals, technical excellence and razor sharp hooks.

Press reviews:

- “This is their first album, and for a debut album, it’s absolutely stunning. The musicianship on show is what you’d expect from a band with loads of albums under their wings, and it’s an amazing starting point. Exciting, stimulating and uplifting.” -  Get Your Rock Out
- “I was honestly blown away... I can picture Kill or Cure on the main stage of any Metal festival with a legion of fans backing them up. It’s rare that I come across a new band that, in my eyes and ears, could conquer the mp3 world and share stages with the big dudes.” - Manchester Rocks
- "This band's lead singer really knows how to rip it, be it with clean vocalled mastery or harsh growled metal madness. The choruses are to die for and just soar beyond all expectations." - Two Guys Metal Reviews
- "Outstanding songwriting and skilful musicianship. 9/10. Excellent" - Onslaught Radio
- “5 star review: I’ve had the privilege to review some truly A grade music with The Metal Review, but Kill or Cure’s debut album has really got me excited. A truly fantastic creation!” - Tom Breedon, The Metal Review <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kill+or+Cure">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
