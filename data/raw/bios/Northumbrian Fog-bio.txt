Northumbrian Fog is the solo project created by Lord Ã†thelfrith. With help from the great and wise Turenn, he is working towards releasing a debut full length album (Name to be announced soon).

What one should expect from this project should be nothing less than the harsh, cold, bloody atmosphere of a kingdom long gone. This is a quest of pride, and heritage. To give life to that that has been forgotten, and arise the white wyvern of England once more.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Northumbrian+Fog">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
