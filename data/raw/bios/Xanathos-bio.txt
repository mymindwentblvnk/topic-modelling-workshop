Xanathos is a Blackened Death Metal band formed in Zaandam, Netherlands founded by Sonneillon and Sisyphus on the 18th of June, 2009. Not long after that Samael and Sirius were recruited to fill in the bass and percussive instrumentation. Inspired by: Behemoth, Gorgoroth, Dark Funeral, Emperor as well as the classic composers Mozart, Verdi, Liszt and Zimmer, and many many more.

Xanathos' intention is to create an intense, virtuous and divine form of Blackened Death Metal with powerful orchestrations while maintaining brutal Metal as the core of this formula.

Xanathos recorded its first demo IMPERIUM NEKROPOLIS, consisting of five songs, in January 2013, which we will complete throughout February. After that, Xanathos will start their road to conquer the throne by musical force as one of the extremest bands in the Netherlands. "If God declares war with Us, so shall we oblige - Reign with Might!"
