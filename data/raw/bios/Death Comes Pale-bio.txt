The foundation of DEATH COMES PALE was originally established by guitarists Bo Guldal and Lars Hj√∏rnholm in the band CARNAL HARVEST (formed in 2003). 

In 2005 the drummer of RAGEBORNE Martin Kilic joined CARNAL HARVEST and the creative foundation of the band was expanded.

In 2007 Martin brought in Kasper Hornstrup (PARIAH SYNDICATE) into the project. After a couple of rehearsals, Kasper was hired as frontman for the band. 

In May of 2008, the band played their first live-show at the HERNING HEAVY HOLOCAUST 08 alongside DAWN OF DEMISE and PSY:CODE. 

Still in need of a bass-player, Kasper tapped Anders Stegmann from PARIAH SYNDICATE and after a few rehearsals Anders were added to the ranks.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/death+comes+pale">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
