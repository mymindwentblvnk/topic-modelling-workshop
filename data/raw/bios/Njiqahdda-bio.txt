Njiqahdda is an atmospheric black metal duo blending psychedelic rock, ambient and many other styles into their unique sound which deals with meditation, spirituality, nature, transcendence. 

Njiqahdda consists of 2 musical entities; Njiqahdda and Njiijn. They are one in the same, just expressed through audio differently. Njiijn explores many types of percussive ambience.

Njiqahdda speaks its own artistic language far removed from decipherable convention - there are no allusions to nationalism, satanism or the occult to be pulled out from here. It's pure and all-consuming catharsis, a rare and raw specimen of rock completely separated from image and meaning, one focused only on the exploding pools of color inside the mindâ€™s eye.

Njiqahdda means "Disciple Of Truth".

"Who we are is not important. The conveyance of abstraction is what IS important. Learn to grasp that which resides both within and outside. To manipulate that which manifests itself in purpose. Bending the weak minds and wills of those who are buried within. Realization is the key." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Njiqahdda">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
