Started in early 2008 by founders Ricky 'Teio' Schuleman and Lawrence 'Daemon' Nielson, Stigmata Dawn is a 5 piece abomination hailing from the blackest abyss in Nelspruit. This harmony uses darkened Melodic Death Metal to seduce the crowd into a malevolent, frenzied orgy from hell.

A mixture of harsh sounds and bloody coughs is what Stigmata Dawn portrays. The lyrics of the band are based on various occult themes and real life occurrences as well as the disturbing nature of our human kind. Stigmata Dawn tries to bring a fresh sound to the Death/Black metal scene. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/StigmataDawn">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
