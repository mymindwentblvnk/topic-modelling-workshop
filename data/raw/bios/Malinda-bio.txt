Malinda Kathleen Reese (shortened to Malinda as her stage name) is a NY/DC based singer, songwriter and actor with a mission to make community through her art. She began her career as a professional actor in regional theatre, originating the role of Ella in "Ella Enchanted: the Musical" and starring as Girl in the DC regional premiere of ONCE. Her original work is a creative exploration of what it is to be a young person in our world today. Dubbed a "social media luminary" by the Washington Post, her YouTube videos range from little conversations, to quirky songs, to fully produced original music videos. Her debut EP, Love Letter, draws influence from pop, musical theater and folk. With the advent of her own music, Malinda is quickly becoming known for her strong sense of vocal storytelling, balancing her pure (to quote her fans) “angelic” tone with a more powerful raw belt. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Malinda">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
