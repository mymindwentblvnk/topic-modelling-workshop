Last Days of May (LDOM for short) is an improvisational rock/experimental trio formed around guitarist Karl Precoda (originally in The Dream Syndicate).  They don't shy away from bone-crunching sound, but don't use traditional song structures or lyrics.  Foregoing genre or category, they work somewhere between improvisational jazz and straight-up rock, though the excesses of either of those are nowhere to be found.  

Their first, self-titled album was put out by No-Fi records in the late 1990s.  They released a pair of follow-up records on Squealer Music, Radiant Black Mind and Inner System Blues.

Their current whereabouts are unknown. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Last+Days+of+May">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
