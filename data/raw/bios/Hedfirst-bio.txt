Hedfirst was formed in 2000. From the beginning Hedfirst was directly focused on hard work, strong attitude, and of course shows. It brought Hedfirst as a recognizable band on polish metal and some hard-core scene. Hedfirst released three full lenght albums (“Hedfirst” – 2003, “Scarismatic” 2005 and “Godforsaken” 2007). First album was released in 2003 by Crash Music Inc. in USA and many other countries. Hedfirst has created periodic polish tour which is called Metal Union Road Tour. In every year Hedfirst invite some greats polish metal and hard-core band to be a part of Metal Union Road Tour. Hedfirst had shared the scene with such great bands like Testament, Soulfly, Mudvayne and Walls Of Jericho.
Right now Hedfirst is focused on a promotion of his latest record, which has been released by band’s label Altart Music on 15th of October 2007. „Godforsaken” is most powerfull, strong, hard, brutal, but with some melodic part, album in Hedfirst’s history. So, if you are into bands like: Hatebreed, Pantera, Slayer, Throwdown, Machine Head etc. this album is FOR YOU.
Hedfirst is currently unsigned and looking for a label.
