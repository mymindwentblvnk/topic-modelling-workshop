Dawn Of Disease is a Death Metal band from Osnabrück, Germany.

Dawn Of Disease was originally founded in 2003. One year later they released the MCD “Through Bloodstained Eyes”, which was sold out within a short time. Despite several performances with popular bands, 2007 marked the end of the band. After numerous line-up problems Dawn Of Disease finally dissolved. But the resurrection with a new line-up didn’t take a long time...


In spring 2009 co-founder and singer Tomasz decided to bring Dawn Of Disease back into being with a nearly completely new line-up. Beside drummer Mathias, who had already been a member of the last known line-up, Lukas (guitars) and Olli (guitars) joined the band. A little later bass player Michael completed Dawn Of Disease shortly before the recording of the first 4-track-promo in November 2009.


In June 2010 Dawn Of Disease recorded their first full-length album “Legends Of Brutality” together with Jörg Uken at Soundlodge Studio (God Dethroned, Dew-Scented, Sinister...). About a half year later a record-deal with NoiseArt Records and a booking-contract with Rock The Nation was signed.

Swedish Death Metal is a huge influence on the quintet. In their songs a big number of typical swedish elements can be found, but Dawn Of Disease are able to add an own style beyond these bounds. Their sound is determined by hardness and melody, subliminal harmonies and killer riffs are accompanied by rapid blastbeats and pounding doublebasses. The vocals, that are between dark growlings, aggressive screams and in-your-face shoutings complete the songs.
