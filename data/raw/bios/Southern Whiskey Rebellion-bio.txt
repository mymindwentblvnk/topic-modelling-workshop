Southern Whiskey Rebellion has been pounding the southern metal scene with LOUD guitars and a plethera of whiskey shots for almost a decade. This brutal quintet has mastered the art of drunken sludge riffery. With infuences that span from Black Sabbath and other 70's rockers to newer bands like Clutch and Mastodon, this band brings an original brew from the Big Easy and surrounding areas. The band is spearheaded by original members Wayne Porche(Bass, Backing Vocals), Jacob LeBlanc(guitars, Vocals), and Mickey Lagrange(Samples). After a couple of member changes, Ron Orgeron(guitars), and Cody Martin(drums) were added to form the solid line up of today. The future looks bright for SWR as their CD, "On Guard Until Seal is Broken" has gone over very well, and has been accepted by a wide range of listeners of all ages. The Whole band was born and raised along the bayous of South Louisiana and it definantly shows in their sound. SWR has made their mark all along the Gulf Coast scene , they are a must see."On Guard Until Seal is Broken", their independant debut release is best summed up as "An infusion of southern sensibilty for harmony and emotive tune, with oldschool punk attitude, and the essense of the swampland." (Ginny Moon of Luner Hypnosis)
SWR has had the honor of sharing the stage with acts such as Goatwhore(Metal Blade), Soilent Green(Metal Blade), Crowbar(Spitfire),Eyehategod(Centry Media), Bleed The Sky(Nuclear Blast) and A Perfect Murder(Victory) among others.
