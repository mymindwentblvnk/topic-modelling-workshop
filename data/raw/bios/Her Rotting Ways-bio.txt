After a three and a half year hiatus, Michigan's Her Rotting Ways is back faster and more dynamic than ever. Influenced by Death/Black/Thrash and Doom Metal, Her Rotting Ways combines these and a melodic sense of violence to construct one of the more original sounding bands within their genre. The ever-changing riff exchange between guitar, bass and drums keeps the listeners busy before the onslaught of sheer vocal terror rings the ears. Intermittent melodies and soaring guitar solos share center stage with the darkened shroud Her Rotting Ways casts abroad, seducing the audience with its succubus-like tendencies.

Influences include Celtic Frost, Black Sabbath, Morbid Angel, and Dissection.
