Suicides were a Belgian underground hardcore band who were active for a short time in the middle of the â€™90s, adapting many different styles within their music such as crust punk and brutal death metal. Although the level of eccentricity ultimately grew too big and the group soon scattered into quite a few different musicprojects. The lead singer/guitarist formed another underground band a few years later (later known as the predecessor of the experimental collective The Demo Saou).

Suicides are also a German music project (Die Suicides). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Suicides">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
