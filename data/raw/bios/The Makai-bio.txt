Formed in 2005, The Makai immediately found an audience within the booming punk and metal scene in Chico, CA. Having embarked on an American tour in the summer of 2006, which brought them to two-thirds of the country, the band enjoyed opening slots for such fabled metal groups as Dillinger Escape Plan, High on Fire and Goatwhore. In early 2006, The Makai were awarded a Cammie when they were voted Critic's Choice for Best Local Band by the Chico News & Review, while guitarist Zeke Rogers was crowned Local Badass via his unwavering support and dedication to Northern California music and community. (Rogers is the founder of the local rock show database Chicolist.com, as well as having been a member and founder of many successful Northern California bands.)

The Makai embarked on an epic six week summer tour in 2007, during which they played the Emissions from the Monolith Festival in Austin as well as debuted their full length album, The End of All You Know, on Seventh Rule Recordings.

In 2008, The Makai enjoyed a successful tour of Europe, playing in France, Germany, Holland, Czech Republic, Italy and Belgium.  Following that tour they released a split 7" with German grind band Attack of the Mad Axeman in early 2009.  That was followed up by a split 10" with Portland epic-crust band Nux Vomica in the summer of 2009.

The Makai is currently putting the finishing touches on a new recording that will be released in 2010.
