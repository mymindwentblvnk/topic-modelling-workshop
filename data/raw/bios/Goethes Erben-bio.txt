Goethes Erben (Goethe's inheritors) is a musical group from Germany started in 1989 by Oswald Henke and Peter Seipt.  The basic idea was to put spoken german words into the center of a music-theatre. After the releases of two demo-tapes and their debut-concert, Peter Seipt leaves the band in July 1990 to go his own musical way with The Seer. Oswald Henke is only working in his studio after that.

In February 1991 Goethes Erben is formed as a group again. Mindy Kumbalek (keyboards, drums and saxophone) and Conny R. (guitars) make the trio perfect.

In this stocking they record their debut-album "Das Sterben ist Ã¤sthetisch bunt" ('Dying is aesthetically colorful') which makes the start of a triology and is published in February 1992 on the Hamburger Label DARK STAR. On this label the following albums are also published. 

Short time before the release of the second album "Der Traum an die Erinnerung" ('The dream of the rememberance'), Conny R. leaves the band of her free will. Their Germany-tour in August 1992 makes the group popular in the country. Mindy Kumbalek and Oswald Henke are supported through Peter Seipt as a part-time-musician.

Until now their musical ways have changed a lot, their popularity increased, as well. They gave several concerts and tours, have had nearly 20 albums and 3 DVDs produced (not every single one was published). 

Their musical genre is not easy to describe. However, they are officially classified in the "Neue Deutsche Todeskunst" ('New german art of death') genre. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Goethes+Erben">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
