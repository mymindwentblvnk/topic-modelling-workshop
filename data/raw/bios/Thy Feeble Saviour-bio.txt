Excruciatingly painful filth is the best description for this one. This band is kind of a mix between the rawest of Black Metal and the harshest War Metal. Blasting and sporadic drums that bring up images of older Beherit or Order From Chaos. High pitched rambling while gargling on baby blood is a good way to describe the vocals, and the guitars are fleeting and to the point. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Thy+Feeble+Saviour">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
