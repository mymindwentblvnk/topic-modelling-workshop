Killing the Reason is an Extreme Metal Band from Granada (Spain). The current line up was consolidated in 2010's Summer focusing on Black Metal. Due to different member influences, they  managed to combine tradition, present time,  technique and atmosphere that characterizes all band compositions. After playing in various concerts in Granada and other Spanish cities, they decided to record their first EP. It was recordered under the tutelage of their good  friend and producer, Javier Rodríguez, getting an excellent result. The desing was carried out by Jose Luis Ballesteros, known as “Gemelo Bueno”, who was able to capture the main members band idea. The release date of the EP entitled: “Beyond Eternity” is on 15th October, 2012. This EP will be accompanied by a mini promotional  tour and hopefully a lot of work for the future of "Killing the Reason”.
