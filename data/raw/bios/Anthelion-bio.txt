Style:
Interweaving brutal rhythms, sorrowfully beautiful piano melodies, and strings of grandeur, Anthelion's music encapsulates beauty, intricacy, extreme intensity, and conflict into a single expression. The vocals are an elaborate web of croaks high and low, stringed together with ear-dissecting screeches that fully express the strong emotions in the songs. The guitars incorporate a sound deeply influenced by speed metal and techniques from classical music onto a foundation of dark and heavy black metal guitar, which compliments Anthelion's resplendent style of music arrangement. Though still fast and brutal, the drums differentiate itself from the usual black metal act by alternating different techniques and tempos to enhance the sense of rhythm in the music. The bass also mixes high-speed picking with techniques from classical music, and appears not only as a sonic underlay but also in solos with other instruments and by itself.
