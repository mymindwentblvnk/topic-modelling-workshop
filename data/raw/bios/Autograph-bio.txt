Autograph was an American glam metal band from Los Angeles, California. Best known for their 1984 hit "Turn up the Radio" (with a music video that was a regular staple on MTV) and  initially active from 1983 to 1989, the band was reformed during 2002-2005 by their founder Steve Plunkett and released albums in 2003. In late 2013, original members Steve Lynch, Randy Rand, and Keni Richards  restarted the band. 

Autograph formed in 1983 with vocalist/guitarist Steve Plunkett joining up with guitarist Steve Lynch, bassist Randy Rand, keyboard player Steven Isham, and drummer Keni Richards. The band seemed to have it all: a fine commercial hard rock debut in 1984's 'Sign in Please', good looks, and great hair. Still, it wasn't enough, and by the time they released the following year's disappointing 'That's the Stuff' the 80s rock audience had moved on. Their 1987 single "Loud and Clear" got a bit of attention, thanks to Ozzy Osbourne's cameo in their video, but it all arrived too late to save the band, which split up in 1989. A posthumous collection of outtakes called 'Missing Pieces' was released about a decade later. 

Despite scoring a massive MTV hit with their very first single, "Turn Up the Radio", which continues to be a classic rock staple, Autograph's songs got lost in the shuffle of the thriving Los Angeles pop metal scene.  Still, interest in their first big hit continues, with the song featured in a variety of places such as the popular 'Grand Theft Auto: Vice City' video game. In 2003, Steve Plunkett put out a reunion album of sorts: an all-new material album entitled 'Buzz', which retained their 80s sound. They've also released the odds and sods album 'More Missing Pieces'. 

Reunion (2013–present) 
In late 2013, original members Steve Lynch, Randy Rand, and Keni Richards got back together for a reunion. Due to Plunkett not being interested in doing the reunion, they have replaced him with Jailhouse, Agent X, Flood, 1RKO, solo artist singer/songwriter/guitarist Simon Daniels. 

Since 2014, by which time Richards had been replaced by Mark Wieland on drums, the band has played the Monsters of Rock Cruise, M3 Rock Festival, The Moondance Jam, The Halfway Jam, Firefest UK, Rockin the Rivers, The Iowa State Fair along with other festivals, theaters and worldwide touring.

In July, the band was featured in USA Today NEWS after playing the famous Halfway Jam Rock Festival. On September 23, the band released their 3rd single "Every Generation" and is featured as track of the week on Classic Rock Magazine.  On January 7, 2016, the new 5 song EP 'Louder', with 4 original new singles and a live version of "Turn up the Radio", was released and is available on the official website. 

On January 10, 2017, the band completed the recordings for the new full album which was released as 'Get Off Your Ass'  on OCTOBER 6 after signing with EMP Label Group owned by David Ellefson.
On April 8, 2017, Keni Richards died at the age of 60. 

On July 24, 2019, Steve Lynch decided to move on to other projects so the band added a new guitarist on August 27, 2019. Jimi Bell previously played in the House of Lords and Maxx Explosion.
