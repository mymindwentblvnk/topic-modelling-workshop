Sam Airey is a musician who originates from the Isle of Anglesey, now residing in the city of Leeds, West Yorkshire. He writes songs, and quite often these songs are about the seaside and/or death, but never exclusively these things.
 
Raised in rural North Wales on various types of folk and country music, Sam blends these influences with the sounds and experiences he has encountered along the way. He plays a variety of instruments, but is sometimes joined by friends, both in studios and on stages. Gaining an ever-increasing amount of plaudits, his live performances have garnered comparisons to such notable songsmiths as Nick Drake, Conor Oberst and Fionn Regan.
