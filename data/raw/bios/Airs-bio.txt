San Francisco based shoegaze trio founded in 2009 by Chris Broyles (Verw√ºstung) and Aaron Kelley (Vuota, Ripple'Field) following the disbandment of their previous musical projects, and joined in 2013 by drummer Kendric DiStefano (Amethyst Falls, Logistic Slaughter) and Conrad Houghtby. Largely remained a studio act until summer 2011 when the band played their first shows in California. Since forming, Airs have released three full length albums and a large number of highly limited EPs on a variety of bizarre formats (including a 5.25" floppy disk in one instance).

A third full length entitled Adore was released on February 14th, 2013.
