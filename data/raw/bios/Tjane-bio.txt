TJANE was founded in september 2003. After playing with the Irish music band Moira for about 8 years, Guy Roelofs decided to explore his own musical roots, traditional music from The Lowlands.

The music of TJANE is rooted in Dutch tradtional music, but influences from other kinds of music, like pop and Celtic are an integral part of the TJANE sound. Because of these influences a kind of Dutch worldmusic is created! Included in the repertoire are original compostions. At the moment they are the only band the Netherlands that play this kind of folk-fusion, so comparing TJANE with other Dutch bands is not possible. Obviously TJANE doesn't try to conservate but aims to re-vitalise our cultural heritage. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tjane">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
