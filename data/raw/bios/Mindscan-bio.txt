MINDSCAN
Besides the bands & acts that displayed their talents on Lowlands Festival 2005, there was a much bigger event only a few of them witnessed: The birth of Mindscan... 
When four people meet up and unite their love and passion for metal and alcohol, there is simply one direction to go: ON STAGE! 
After a try-out one week earlier, Mindscan played their first gig on the 14th of october in Nighttown, Rotterdam, only 7 weeks after their full birth. 
What appeared to the audience was much more than a new dutch metalcore band! 
Mindscan display a mix of: 
•Melodic metalcore, deathmetal, mosh, punk and doom with clean emotional vocals, death screams and brutal grunts, confronting you from 3 sides of the stage 
•A furious show that's filled with adrenaline, affection for the audience and each other and last but not least, an urge to drain themselves from every last bit of energy 
Now, finally we can show you the recipe: 
•Mandy Struik: guitars, clean vocals and grunts 
•Tamara Smith: bassguitars 
•Nico Beemster: drums and grunts 
•John Saarloos: guitars and clean vocals 
 
Mindscan recorded and released a promo CD called Diagnosis in 2006 and a CD single called Paralyses in 2007. They also feature on Stainl; a Dutch metalcore compilation released by Tocado-records/Increase records in 2007. The band is currently working on their first full length. Their music has shifted more and more towards Mathcore... <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mindscan">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
