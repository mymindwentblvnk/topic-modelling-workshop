New Mexico-based Spiritu was formed in August of 2000 by vocalist Jadd, guitarist Chav, bassist John Bess and drummer James. The following year, the band headed to Seattle and entered the studio with renowned indie rock producer Jack Endino (Nirvana, Soundgarden, etc.), emerging three days later with their self-titled debut album. Released by Meteor City in September 2002, it was followed by a European tour in support of Clutch and Spiritual Beggars, after which Spiritu returned home to work on their second L.P.
