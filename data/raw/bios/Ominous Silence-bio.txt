Ominous Silence was formed in 2005 in Veliky Novgorod. Band name reflects the calm before the storm, about to happen something terrible, but it is not happening yet, a feeling akin to the roar of air masses in an empty room, bringing forth the ringing in the ears. 
It is difficult to determine the OS musical style. Today the group is working at the junction of atmospheric gothic melodies and power metal rhythms. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ominous+Silence">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
