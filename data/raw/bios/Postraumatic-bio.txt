The band was formed in Athens, Greece in 2008 musically focusing on technical thrash metal. As time progressed, attempts began to be made at introducing and importing musical elements from a broader scope, for example a more industrial feel (Industries of Suffering).

Lyrically themes, ideas and beliefs are explored and/or criticized such as ethics (or the lack therein); religion and oppression of human rights (e.g. clitoridectomy); human manipulation via behaviorism and mind controlling; etc.

As of late 2010, after several line-up changes including the addition of samples and effects controlling, the band is in the process of writing and exploring new material, rehearsing, and recording a demo of some older tracks.
