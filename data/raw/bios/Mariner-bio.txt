MARINER began as a group in the late 70's, as "FOURTH CHAPTER". 
The members grew up together in Dearborn Heights MI. and began their professional life by playing the local school dances. 
As their reputation for perfection grew, so did the attendance at all the various venues they preformed at. 
In 1980 the band entered a nation wide "battle of the bands" winning out over 700 other entries. 
This propelled the band into touring. 
Japan, Canada and the U.S. became the bands home throughout the rest of the 80's. 

MARINER continued well into the 1990â€™s, setting attendance records and recording a large number of songs and video's. 

Mariner tracks have been placed in Film and Prime time TV shows including 
" Cold Case files" and Reunion on FOX.
