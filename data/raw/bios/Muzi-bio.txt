Born in Mbabane, Swaziland, a small enclave surrounded by South Africa, Muzi and his family moved to Southwest Atlanta when he was just a few years old. His mother reunited with his father, whom she met while putting herself through college at Atlanta's AU Center. Having to return to her native country to care for her family, she also gave birth to Muzi. In an effort to become an official citizen of the United States, his father passed on his American name, and Muzi became Billy-Ray Little Jr. While growing up in the SWATS, Billy-Ray discovered his passion for music by listening to the tunes of all genres, including country, dub-step, hip hop artists such as Bone-Thugs-N'-Harmony and hometown idols Outkast. He and a few high school friends formed an a capella group, singing the likes of Boyz II Men covers at open mics and talent shows. They naturally progressed into writing and recording original songs, ultimately becoming a songwriting team. They signed a deal with RCAM, alongside label-mates The Indigo Girls, and continued writing for various producers, such as The Underdogs. Billy-Ray then garnered his first major placements with title tracks on several 2010 releases. After this endeavor Muzi began his solo career along side beatsmith Shoden!1 and Somnolence was then set in motion. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Muzi">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
