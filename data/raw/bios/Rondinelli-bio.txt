Rondinelli is "fronted" by drummer Bobby Rondinelli and his brother Ted who plays guitar.  This band has only two albums, but has a very strong Black Sabbath connection.  Bobby himself played drums on two Sabbath albums over the span of a couple of years from 1993-1995.

Also singing on the first Rondinelli album (Wardance) was Ray Gillen, who sang for Sabbath in 1986 & 1987, as well as singing for Badlands, who was fronted by Jake E. Lee, Ozzy Osbourne's former guitarist.   James LoMenzo played bass on this album and left to join White Lion in 1985.

The second Rondinell album is fronted by Tony Martin, who sang on six Sabbath albums from 1987 through 1995.  It also has Neil Murray on bass, who was in Sabbath too.

Good stuff and you'll probably like it a lot if you listen to Tony Martin's era of Black Sabbath. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rondinelli">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
