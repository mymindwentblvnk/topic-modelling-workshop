The band gained notoriety after being banned from a contest organized by "Tiempos Violentos", the most well known heavy metal radio show in Argentina. Some rumors say that the band does not exist, as it seems that all they do is insult Gustavo Olmedo (a local radio DJ, host of Tiempos Violentos), but the truth is that a record exists, and the band opened for Brujeria this year.
