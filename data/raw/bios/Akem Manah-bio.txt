Two bands are known as "Akem Manah":

1) Akem Manah is an eclectic doom metal band from Belgium that was formed at the end of 2007. Its musical influences include doom and death metal, mixed with progressive elements, while the lyrical concepts are mainly inspired by existentialist philosophy and supernatural horror literature.

Over the years the band suffered a number of line-up changes, but eventually settled on a core line-up consisting of Benjamin (7-string guitars), Ruben (fretless 6-string bass), Michaël (drums) and Xavier (vocals and synth). In 2010, they wrote, recorded and released their first album, ‘The Testament of Sealant Mound’.

With the help of Glenn on second guitar, 2011 also marked the band’s first national and international live performances, sharing the stage with Saturnus, Officium Triste, Marche Funèbre and others. In the summer of 2011 Glenn left the band and was replaced by Kevin.

During 2011, the band recorded "Beneath", a twenty-one minute long track, combining elements of every influence Akem Manah has ever incorporated. It was released January 2012 and promoted at a series of gigs in the Spring. In the Fall of 2012 Kevin left the band and was replaced by Xavier.
