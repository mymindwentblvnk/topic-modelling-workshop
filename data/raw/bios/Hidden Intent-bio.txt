Early 2011 bassist/vocalist Chris McEwen (Abyzmal, Troops of Doom, Obsidian Aspect) and lead guitarist Phil Bennett (Desert Eagle, Metallica Black Album Tribute, Iron Maiden Tribute) decided to form a thrash metal band after their current bands fell through. 

The two came up with material quickly, the music heading into an old school thrash sound mixed with elements of 90's groove metal and blackened thrash. After a brief encounter with a drummer and a long search for a replacement, Jay Rahaley (Blood Mason, Treachery) was recruited to complete the line up. 

Hidden Intent's sound is a throwback to the old school days of thrash metal i.e. early Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, Coroner, Annihilator. Punters have often said Hidden Intent's live shows/sound has been described as 'Good time thrash', 'energetic', 'amusing crowd interaction' and a reminiscence of Testament and Slayer .

2013 sees Hidden Intent in good form having toured South East Asia including headlining the Bangkok Thrash Festival as well as releasing their anticipated debut album "Walking Through Hell" independently and releasing a music video on YouTube for the title track of the album.
