Dead Disco were Victoria Hesketh (aka Little Boots), Lucy Catherwood & Marie France (now with Video Villain). Together they formed a thrilling Leeds, UK band - with a mix of new wave, post-punk & pop - they created a buzz amongst locals, then nationwide.

Lucy & Marie met Victoria, in August 2005, whilst at Leeds University & the trio spontaneously bonded, over a mutual love for The Bangles, Blondie, The Killers, Billy Idol, Gang of Four, The Slits & The Rapture.

They released four singles:  'The Treatment' (High Voltage) 'City Place' (Playlouder) 'Automatic' (Fierce Panda) and 'You're Out' (679).

For both 'The Treatment' and ‘Automatic’ Dead Disco teamed up with producer du jour James Ford. The result sounds like an unlikely, but genial, meeting between Ladytron and Girls Aloud (with added guitars), making ‘Automatic’ an incredibly infectious slice of pop perfection. 

‘Automatic’ has an equally contagious video (directed by Saam Farahmand - the guy responsible for the Klaxons’ ‘Gravity’s Rainbow’ and ‘Atlantis to Interzone’ Videos) that features the girls stylistically thrashing about inside a revolving cube. 

Dead Disco disbanded in December 2008 because of unknown causes (you can read here). After this, the girls concentrated on their own projects: Victoria Hesketh on Little Boots, Lucy Catherwood and Marie France on Video Villain.
