Kreuzweg Ost is a dark wave/martial industrial/neo classical project by Michael Gregor (Silenius of Summoning), with Ronald Albrecht. The music is a blend of world war-related samples and loops with booming sounds and instrumental pieces. There are no vocals, instead, the predominant samples are arranged so that they take their role, sometimes telling kind of small stories similar to radio play snippets.
