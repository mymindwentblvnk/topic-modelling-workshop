Frozen Caress is an italian gothic/doom metal band. The project was born in 2005 as a duo when Davide Serra [vocals, piano, keys] and his friend Andrea Viola [ex-female vocals] decided to play together. In winter 2008 Davide and Andrea suddenly stopped their work relationship: Frozen Caress became Davideâ€™s solo-project. The first release was an acoustic and untitled home-made demo published on-line in 2009; at the end of the year the solitary musician met Erika Martin and Antonio Leggieri, rispectively vocalist and guitarist, who joined the project to work on the second demo "Souvenirs" and the single "De Solo Corde"; meanwhile the new bass player Edoardo Giardina was joining the project, Erika left the band because of some personal problems, so Davide became the only singer. On jannuary 24th 2014 the new Frozen Caress line-up released the debut full-length album "INTROJECTION": it's available for free through the internet and stands for a huge style development.
