There are multiple artists named Saturnalia:
  
1) Saturnalia was a British psychedelic rock band founded in London, England, UK. Their sole album was the first 3D picture disc and has therefore become highly collectable. It also gained a certain amount of notoriety by featuring the band members topless on one side of the picture disc.
The band, including former members of the band Horse, went on a headlining tour of the UK, culminating in a performance at London's Rainbow Theatre. The tour was not a financial success and the band disbanded soon afterwards.
Band members were Aletta Lohmeyer (vocals), Adrian Hawkins (vocals), Rod Roach (guitar), Richard Houghton (bass) and Tom Crompton (drums).
The LP "Magical Love" was produced by former Yardbird Keith Relf, and it was first released in1969 (and not 1973 as erroneously stated elsewhere), having several reissues being done later (by Italian Akarma label for example). The album contains slightly occult themed Psychedelic early progressive rock, resembling Jefferson Airplane with their similar male/female double vocals and West Coast psych sounding guitar tones.

2) Saturnalia is a band from Omaha, NE, United States, founded in 1999 by the current band members Adam, Mark and Ron. In the early winter of 2002 Matt and Shawn joined the trio.
