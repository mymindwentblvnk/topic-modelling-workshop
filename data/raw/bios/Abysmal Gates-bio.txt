Melodic, yet brutal USBM and Blackened Death with symphonic keyboards blended together to unleash atmospheric darkness that is dynamic and grim all at the same time. In the vein of BLOODSTAINED DUSK, ABAZAGORATH, CRIMSON MOON, TENGEREKEN, etc. "Serve their mortal flesh, devoid of light!" "Overall, an outstanding release that should be picked up by any demanding metal listener who devoutly worships at the altar of Emperor or Dimmu Borgir. Intense - Live4Metal". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Abysmal+Gates">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
