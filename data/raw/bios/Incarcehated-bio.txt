A powerful thrash act based out of João Pessoa, Brazil, Incarcehated were formed in 2013 by Arthur Hermann (Guitar/Vocals), Thiago Rodrigues (Bass), Cácio Zérra (Lead Guitar) and Lucas Anderson (Drums). Employing a fast and agressive South American style of Thrash while maintaining a melodic groove-oriented edge, the quartet recorded a self-produced EP entitled "Halfskull" which have the track "Nightmare Reality" featured on a compilation album by EMP, label from Megadeth's bassist and founder, David Ellefson.

After spending some time playing live and crafting their music, they landed a great debut album, Tales From The Streets in 2016, which show us a more grown-up and focused band pushing foward to achieve their own sound.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Incarcehated">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
