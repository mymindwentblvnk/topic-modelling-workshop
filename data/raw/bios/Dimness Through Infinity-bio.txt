The 1998 formation of DIMNESS THROUGH INFINITY comprised female vocalist Aliye and Alyin Abbak, male singer Aytac Ozcan, guitarist Emrah Korkmaz, keyboard player Bülent Sarilar. The band made their first public impressions with the 'Dreadful Tales Of Feeble Breeze' demo that same year. However, Sarilar would then exit prior to 1999's 'When The Soul Weeps Alone…' recordings. In 2000 Aytac Ozcan opted out as DIMNESS THROUGH INFINITY prepared for their debut album 'Nymph'. Bringing in Ebru Namli as new female singer the group also made the decision to incorporate violin and cello to their sound. Unfortunately the band is disbanded.
