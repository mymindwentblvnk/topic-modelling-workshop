Oblique Effect is the debut solo album from progressive rock guitarist Lucian S. Tu. The CD offers incredible instrumental/progressive metal tracks showcasing intense musicianship, grinding guitar riffs and soaring leads backed by a punishing rhythm section of drums and bass. Tu also features a number of talented guest guitar soloists on Oblique Effect, including Jim Williams, Jeff Slingluff and Eric Kirkland. The music combines the heaviness and drive of albums such as Chris Poland's "Return To Metalopolis" with the progressive leanings of the recent, heavier work by groups such as Dream Theater. There are a few vocal elements; a couple of spoken introductions and brief vocals on "Mirrored" and "The Little Drone", but by and large this is a visonary instrumental metal meltdown. Highly recommended. Instrumental Guitar (Electric (Heavy)/Heavy Metal/Progressive), total running time, 60:13
