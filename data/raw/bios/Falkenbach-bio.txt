Falkenbach is a one-man German Viking metal project created by Vratyas Vakyas (literally, "The Searching Wanderer"). Vratyas Vakyas lived in Iceland for a considerable time, but now lives in DÃ¼sseldorf (NRW), Germany again. Throughout the band's lifetime, Falkenbach has progressed from a rawer, more "black" sound towards viking-influenced folk metal with mainly clean vocals. Vakyas' music is nowdays accompanied by session musicians.
