Badm√≥mzjay (born September 27, 2002; bourgeois Jordan "Josy" Napieray) is a German rapper with Polish roots.

In 2019 she signed a record deal with the major label Universal Music, shortly after she founded her own label, Bad Momz Records. Her songs quickly received millions of hits on Spotify and YouTube.

In her songs and music videos she clearly distinguishes herself from the classic German rap. With her (clothing) style she tries to emphasize this demarcation and her closeness to American hip-hop. 

She takes up well-known works of trap music, imitates role models such as Nicki Minaj, Cardi B and 21 Savage and switches between German and English. Her red-dyed hair and long artificial fingernails are one of her trademarks. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/badm%C3%B3mzjay">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
