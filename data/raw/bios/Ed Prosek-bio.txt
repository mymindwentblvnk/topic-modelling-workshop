Ed Prosek is an American singer-songwriter, currently residing in Brighton, United Kingdom. 

'Striking new talent Ed Prosek brings a modern authenticity, passion and originality to the British Singer-Songwriter scene and is quickly establishing himself as an up and coming artist with serious prospects for the future.
In 2010, California native Ed Prosek brought his original flavor of orchestral folk music to Brighton. The son of an Opera composer, his musical talents emerged from a formal classical background, including years of study at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music, and a stint with the notable Magik*Magik Orchestra. His current project is the culmination of his classical prowess and savvy pop sensibilities; producing a sound that transcends labels or the boundaries of genre. Accompanied by a seven-piece band and a string quartet, his most recent work, his re-imagination of Paul Simon’s classic: ‘Homeward Bound’ has been featured as the soundtrack to the newest Cathedral City ad campaign. His debut release, ‘California’, having sold several thousand copies since its release in June 2012, has established Ed as an artist to watch out for in the coming year. With his upcoming tour and follow up EP to be released Spring, 2013, the excitement and anticipation is building along with his dedicated and ever expanding fanbase.'
