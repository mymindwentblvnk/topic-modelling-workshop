Tel Aviv natives, Vaadat Charigim ("Exceptions Committee") are a trio consisting of Juval Haring, Yuval Guttman and Dan Fabian Bloch.  They play a blend of 80's Israeli underground rock (influenced by the likes of Plastic Venus and Yossi Elephant) with a more contemporary Shoegaze sound.
Despite the language barrier, songs that have leaked online, have won praise both in the local as well as international media, due to Haring's unique vocal style - a beguiling combination of melody and dissonance, sweetness and darkness.
Producer Kyle "Slick" Johnson (who has worked with Modest Mouse, Wavves and Cymbals Eat Guitars), worked  for long months together with the band,  on their debut album - "The World is Well Lost", which was recorded by the band in a southern Tel-Aviv apartment.
