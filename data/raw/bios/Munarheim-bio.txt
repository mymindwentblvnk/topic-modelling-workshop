Munarheim was founded in 2007 and released their second EP „…und der Wind sang“ under the banner of “Düsterwald Produktionen”, accompanied by positive reviews.
In March 2013 a first foretaste of the upcoming debut album (“Nacht und Stürme warden Licht”) was released as an 4-Track EP. First live appearances followed with additional band members to recreate the sound of Munarheim live as close as possible as on CD. The lyrics revolve around inner yearning, nature romanticism and social critique.
The music relects a blend of black metal and folk with orchestra coloratura. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Munarheim">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
