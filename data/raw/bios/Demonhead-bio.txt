Spawned in early 2007 from a mutual love of metal and hard & heavy rock, with members from 'Eye of the Enemy' and 'Envenomed' Demonhead are ready to tear the roof off!! Widely known for their energetic, infectious and sometimes chaotic live shows, Demonhead will leave you with a grin on your face and a nasty hangover the next day. Armed with their Debut E.P. "Demonology 101" fusing pub rock with face melting solos and fist pumping metal anthems, they are a band you definitely won't forget.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Demonhead">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
