Although born in 2013 fueled by the desire to experiment with mixing musical genres and odd soundscapes, Dust In Mind doesn’t turn the music world around – it only shows its endless creative possibilities. The music and the tortured vocals from Dam (inherited from the Death Metal band Blindness) combined with the ethereal voice of Jen (Shindo, Light And Chaos as guest, Marc Canova as guest) makes Dust In Mind a powerful, unique and groovy Industrial Metal band. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dust+in+Mind">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
