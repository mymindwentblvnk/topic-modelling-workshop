EOC was formed back in 1991 after the split up of Nex and Excess Of cruelty. They played somekind of brutal deathmetal.
In 1995 a second guitarplayer Jan Verscheuren entered the band and a promotape was recorded (Fionnuala). The tape was released at the end of 1996.
Their first full lentgh CD was recorded in september 1997 and released in 1998. It turned out to be a fairly well played melodic deathmetal in the veins of In flames, At the gates and other swedish deathmetal bands.
In 1998 Raf veulemans left the band to join Aegrimonea (black metal). A new bassplayer joined: Gerry Verstreken (Chemical Breath). In 2000 Joris Tallon left the band due to personal conflicts within the band. EOC searched for new musicians and worked on new material. They did some more gigs in Belgium and abroad. They did their gigs under the old name. During 2003 - 2004 they recorded another CD. The CD was released under the bands name Re:creation.The band split up sometime afterwards
