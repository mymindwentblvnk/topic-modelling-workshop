Gravetemple is the name given to the line-up of Attila Csihar, Stephen O'Malley and Oren Ambarchi. The trio formed in United States in the summer of 2006 to perform a series of live shows in Israel, while Israel was engaged in the 2006 Lebanon War. In Summer 2008 the trio reformed together with Australian drummer Matt "Skitz" Sanders for a short European tour. This band is not to be confused with the Burial Chamber Trio which consists of a similar line-up but with Greg Anderson instead of Stephen O'Malley. Gravetemple released The Holy Down in 2007 through Southern Lord Records; Ambient/Ruin in 2008 and Le Vampire de Paris in 2009 were Self-released.

Gravetemple is a sacred metaphor & psychedelic spiritual abstraction. They combine metal instrumentation with feedback, drones and minimalist composition. Expect a disorientating mix of lighting and sonic power, and an unforgettable physiological experience, communicated via a wall of amplification. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gravetemple">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
