The band was created during jam sessions in July 2007 when the members saw that the music they create together doesn't sound that bad. At first there were only David (then on bass), Milos and Goran. Later they found out that the music sounds good with a keyboard. David changed his proffesion to keyboard. The band was looking for a bassman and in the right time Andrej showed up. The band is now playing instrumental music that connects manny different musical styles.
