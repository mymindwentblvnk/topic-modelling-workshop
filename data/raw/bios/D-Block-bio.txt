D-Block formerly known as The L.O.X. is a group of 5 emcees originating from Yonkers, New York discovered by Mary J. Blige. The name The L.O.X. originated from "The Warlox", however, it was shortened to The LOX. The LOX is now a backronym for "Living Off Experience" and is composed of Jadakiss (Jayson Phillips), Sheek Louch (Shawn Jacobs), and Styles P (David Styles), and the newer recruit J-Hood (Jae Hood)  and A money (Anna Levenshus).  (J-Hood has subsequently left the group.)  As The L.O.X., Bad Boy Records released their first album Money, Power, and Respect and released "Money, Power, and Respect" as their lead single. During this time, their tribute to the late Notorious B.I.G., "We'll Always Love Big Poppa" became a single that put the group on the map.
