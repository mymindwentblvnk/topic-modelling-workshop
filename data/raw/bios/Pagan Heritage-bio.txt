Pagan Heritage was formed by W.Timmer in 2005 in Groningen, the Netherlands. A promo was recorded and now looking for a label to release it on cd.

Pagan Heritage is black metal going back to the roots of the second wave of black metal. The band is influenced by bands as Graveland, old Darkthrone and Burzum and Beherit. Pagan Heritage does not look for any compromise with the current commerce surrounding present black metal.

The philosophy of Pagan Heritage is low tempo grim black metal.

Pagan Heritage has released one demo called The Book of Shadows on Sword Productions and a new demo called Hymns of Suicide will be released on the same label soon and is ready. Pagan Heritage fully supports the Pagan Front, its bands and labels. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pagan+Heritage">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
