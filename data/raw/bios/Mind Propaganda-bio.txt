MIND PROPAGANDA is an Atmospheric Heathen Black Metal band from the Oriana Lands. In December 2005 we've recorded our first "Demo" - 21 minutes of Pure Antichristianity enforced by Pagan Wrath. In June 2006 it was released as a Split-CD with German band ISMARK by Nordsturm Productions. First full album "The First Strike" is planned to be released on CD in October 2006 by Blazing Productions.
