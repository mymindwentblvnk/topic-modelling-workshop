SEDUCE THE HEAVEN was formed in mid 2009 by guitarist Alex Flouros and soon joined by the lyrical soprano Elina Laivera on vocals founding in this way the main structure of the band. In the following months, a full album consisting of 10 tracks had already been prepared for the recording process.

SEDUCE THE HEAVEN is combining powerful elements of Melodic/Death, Metal-Core, Power and Symphonic elements in a unique, technical and brutal, yet very melodic way. Their debut album "Field Of Dreams" covers a wide range of musical styles moving from progressive to PANTERA-like paths, from the bursting trails of NWOAM and bands like Killswitch Engage to the powerful breakouts of the Swedish melodic death metal scene. What is also special about the sound of SEDUCE THE HEAVEN is two vocalists exchanging duos of male growl vocals and female clean vocals that move from rock to lyrical paths delivering also a gothic note onto a massive setting of wave-crashing guitars, drums and bass. Jazz harmonies, 80's influences, dark, aggressive, straight in-your-face blast of power, melody and atmosphere. SEDUCE THE HEAVEN is a unique fusion for fans of many sides of the metal battlefield.

The band's current line-up is:

Alex Flouros - guitars
Elina Laivera - vocals
Marios Mizo - growl vocals
Chris Kollias - bass
John Thomas - drums
Sinnik Al - guitars
