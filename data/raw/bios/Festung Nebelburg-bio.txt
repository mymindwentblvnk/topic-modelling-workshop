In the last days of November 2004, Nattulv decided to start a studio project, a "one-man-band" called Nordfrost which became FESTUNG NEBELBURG after a bit more than a year. Nattulv started to write lyrics about the nature-related Germanic paganism of ancestors and the general admiration for nature and the circle of the year as well as of the life of the ancient Germanic people. Another imporant influence (which became more and more important) for Nattulv´s music and lyrics is his homeland, the the Bavarian Forest in the South-East of Germany with its deep dark forests, high mountains and its special sagas formed by the soul of the amazing and mystic landscapes. The Bavarian Forest is considered as a place where Germanic tribes crossed the resident Celtic tribes of that area. This cultural and spiritual heritage is an essential part of Nattulv´s "motor" to continue with his music.
All songs and instruments are recorded in his homestudio. He is responsible for the playing of the instruments and for the vocals. Besides classic instruments like e-guitars, he also tries to use more "folky" instruments as flutes and harmonicas. In the musical aspect, Nattulv is mainly influenced by Black Metal, Neofolk and Rock. After sending away some promo-CDs of his recorded material, Blood Fire Death Productions decided to sign Festung Nebelburg. The debut album “Gabreta Hyle” is planned to be released in the end of June 2007.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Festung+Nebelburg">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
