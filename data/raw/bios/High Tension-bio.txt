Since 1996 the 2 Dutch amature producers X-ecute and Fennek stopped competing each other and teamed up.
High Tension was born. In that time hardcore or gabber music was our thing. 
Slowly we moved over to trance music. 
After we gained more experience and tools we got more into jazzy lounge, house and techno music.

X-ecute performed at several parties as a techno DJ and in that time Fennek teamed up with the Dutch rapper Nieuwegrond.
