Draper has had a passion for music from an early age and at 16 started recording in collaboration with various underground artists. Merely two years later, inspired by the stiff competition here at Indaba Music, he became heavily involved in the remixing scene. Rising through the ranks, he appeared frequently on our winners’ lists, receiving accolades such as runner up on the Laurie Anderson competition judged by Lou Reed, first prize in the ‘Electronic Musician Magazine’ and ‘Conspiracy For Good’ original composition contests, and most recently placing as a runner-up in The Qemists remix competition.

Draper’s first big break came when he remixed a video commentary by YouTube celebrity Chris Smoove. The remix, entitled ‘Waiting On A Noob’, went on to become his first release, reaching the number 14 spot on Amazon’s hip-hop/rap chart within hours of its release. He has recently been scouted to produce an EP with Blac Flagg Labs, a hip hop outfit based in Detroit. The self-titled EP is set for release on Prime Records USA in December.

Late in 2010 Draper released his first e.p. aptly titled “The Introduction”, which is an electronic banquet of sweet synths, undulating rhythms, and complex melodies. Trafficking heavily in dubstep and electronica “The Introduction” is most striking for its refreshing listenability. You can get a couple of the tracks for free or buy the entire e.p. over at Draper’s homepage.
