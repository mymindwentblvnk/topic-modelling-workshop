The first official line-up was: bass player Dario, singer Ronny (ex Hydra), lead guitarist Luka, rhythmic guitarist Gabr√øele (ex Evil Presage) and drummer Luca (Hatefable). Between May and July the band write 5 songs that were recorded on the "Damnation's Flower" demo. At the end of the recording sessions the drummer Luca decides to leave the band. The separation was totally friendly. After several auditions Darko Kun from Subliminal Verses joined the band as the new drummer. After the last summer concert, the bass player and founder, Dario Orecchia, left the band. MayAle (ex Hatefable) joined the band as new bass player and Luka and Ronny friendly left the band for musical differences.
