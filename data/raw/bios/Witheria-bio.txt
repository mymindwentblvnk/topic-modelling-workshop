Witheria was formed in the early 2000 as Tuberculosis joined forces with Kusmar, Rob and Hardon (gtr), who all lived in Espoo, Finland and shared a passion for raw, relentless metal.

They soon recorded they first demo “Fallout” in just one day. The band was affected by the members’ military services, but managed to write and record the “Demo 02” and “Pureditself” demos, and further developed their thrashy style.

In 2004 Witheria recorded their first promotional CD at Seawolf Studios. The promo got some praise from the media, but no recording deals were signed. A pre-production demo was recorded and the band booked Jive Studio to record their first full length “Infernal Maze” in 2005. The album was released the following year by a small Finnish label Twisted Face and got great reviews presenting 45 minutes of darkened thrash metal.

The band played gigs around Finland and wrote material for the 2nd album “Painful Escape”, which was recorded in Jive Studios in 2007. Stay Heavy Records released the album in early 2009. Witheria promoted the album at the Finnish Metal Expo and played several successful gigs, including one in London, UK. Great reviews were flooding in, the material being more versatile than ever before.

Finally, in 2010 Witheria booked D-Studio and recorded “Vanishing Order”, their 3rd album. It’s the best sounding, most complex and heaviest work the band has ever done. "Vanishing Order" will be released on 2nd March 2011 by Violent Journey Records in CD and digital download formats. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Witheria">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
