While most biographies are filled with boasting fancy promotional praises like "The new definition of metal", this is not one of them. Like there is no need to reinvent the wheel as the circular shape is proven to work best, there also is no need to reinvent the metal as it always comes down to heavy, hard and fast riffs that fight along fierce drumming, thunderous bass and vocal tone you always wanted to use to tell your boss you quit your stinking job.

Scarcyde was formed in late 2008 by Kai, Toni, Jesse, Ville and Aki so despite being fairly new addition to metal scene the members have vast experience from other past and present bands/projects. The music itself is a combination of the five different personalities and their influences resulting in something that has been described as hardcore as well as deathmetal and many things between. In the end, the decision of the style is in the ear of the listener.

First demo was recorded in February 2009 at Matrixtor studio and by the summer a full live set was ready to be thrown to live audiences. In August, Scarcyde ended up opening TLY mainstage for bands like Amoral, Profane Omen and Entombed. In March of 2010, Scarcyde opened for Scar Symmetry on their tours last show with Bible Black. 

While future remains unseen, this is just a beginning. You wanted metal, we welcome you to Scarcyde.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Scarcyde">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
