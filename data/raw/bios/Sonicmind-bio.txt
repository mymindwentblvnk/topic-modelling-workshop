Sonicmind started as a pretty basic melo-death band in the vein of the Swedish scene but some way, some how, influences from other music genres started to appear in the songs. Those "outside" influences include such bands as Queen and the Beatles, to name a few. Broadening their musical scope fueled the bands' development and the Sonicmind sound of today was developed quickly.

The response from the live shows and the Everlasting & Co. demo was so good that Sonicmind decided to record a single with a decent budget. The band wrote and rehearsed 10 songs for the pre-production and eventually songs called "Face Off", "Drive" and "Reflections" were chosen to represent the spectrum of the music. "Face Off" was released in March 2006 and it was success within media but in the audience as well.

The band went on a hiatus shortly after lead vocalist Lauri decided to leave in early 2007.

In 2012 Johannes, Kristian and Matti decided to reunite. With a new drummer and a vocalist Sonicmind is preparing to record some new and some old songs as well as playing live.
