Calvin Johnson is a guitarist, vocalist and founding member of the bands Cool Rays, Beat Happening, The Go-Team, Dub Narcotic Sound System, and The Halo Benders.  He is known for his uniquely deep, droning singing voice.  Johnson was born in Olympia, Washington.

He has worked with Beck, Heavenly, The Microphones, Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, and Built to Spill among others. He has also produced recordings by many bands.

Calvin Johnson is the founder of K Records in Olympia, Washington, and was one of the major organizers of the seminal International Pop Underground Festival.

His first solo album, "What Was Me", is a quiet acoustic piece about love and loss. On a few songs he sings with no backing guitar, and the effect is haunting.

His second album,  "Before the Dream Faded...", is a jazzier piece. It includes multiple collaborators, making it markedly different from his first album. The songs cover an odd range of subjects, such as the size and color of hearts, Lucifer, and falling in love.

He can be found spinning records as Selector Dub Narcotic. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Calvin+Johnson">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
