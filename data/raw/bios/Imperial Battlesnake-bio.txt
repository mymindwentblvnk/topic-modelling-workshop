Imagine that somewhere in the middle of a deep, black ocean five Rock and Roll soldiers emerge form their under-a-skull-shaped-volcano studio and proudly hoist their flag, emblazoned with only one word: "ATTACK!". One need not use their imagination to see that IMPERIAL BATTLESNAKE wastes no time dropping the gauntlet and charging forward into an aural war with its first full-length album "ATTACK!", Not just the title of the album, "ATTACK!" is a battle cry for the legions of Metal militiamen who want nothing more than to see real Metal return and blast corporate faux-Metal into paste.

With razor-sharp guitar riffs and cast-iron vocals IMPERIAL BATTLESNAKE ride roughshod astride a rhythm section fervently dedicated to punishing dynamics. Since early 2004 this band has been rattling the sabre handed to it from the metal warlords of a bygone era while blowing the dust off battle lines drawn by fallen punk rock combatants. IMPERIAL BATTLESNAKE's first EP/Demo, 2005's "Truth to Power" was met by rock critics with much praise. Sleazegrinder.com called it "real, live, raw, pick-up-your-teeth-on-the-way-out rock n' fucking roll, so if you're in the mood to punch somebody out or break just about any law at all, track this down and crank the bitch first." Monica Kendrick of the Chicago Reader called BATTLESNAKE "the geniuses behind Pastor of Muppets". Now galvanized by several national tours, IMPERIAL BATTLESNAKE brings its most mature and aggressive offering to the table.
