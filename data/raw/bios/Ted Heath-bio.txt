Ted Heath (1902-1969) was the top UK bandleader of the 40s, 50s and early 60s. Born in Wandsworth, S. London, he started playing trombone at the age of 14 and played with Jack Hylton, Ambrose, Sid Lipton and Geraldo. He brought his own orchestra together in 1944 for the BBC and his career took off, including many hit records, the biggest success being "Swinging Shepherd Blues". During the 1950s his orchestra frequently performed at the Hammersmith Palais de Dance and from 1956 Heath and his orchestra were regular visitors to the United States. He employed many of the big-name British jazz musicians and his vocalists included Denis Lotus, Lita Rosa and the top British vocalists of the early to mid-50s, Dickie Valentine who went on to have a very successful solo career. The orchestra was disbanded in 1964 when Heath's health started faltering. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ted+Heath">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
