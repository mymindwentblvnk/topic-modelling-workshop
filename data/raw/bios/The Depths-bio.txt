1) Blackened thrash/death metal from PA.

2)The Depths is a one man project, unleashed about an year ago by 25 years old guy, Habib Tammar, who began playing music since his childhood.

He started with piano and then at 15 he oriented his musical tastes and debuted on guitar playing. Furthermore he got to deal shortly with some other instruments such as percussion, flute, harmonica but his interests are focused on guitars.

At the age of 16/17 years he got in touch with local bands :
1998/1999: synthetizer in a group of pop/rock In Tunis (Tunisia).
2000 : - participation in a competition on national radio (RTCI) program live enlivened by Donia Chaouch and supervised by Fawzi Chkili
-Membership in his first metal band.
2000/2003 : Joined Metal band Occulta as a guitarist.
2004 : Joined Alithea as a guitarist.
2005/2006 : Two side projects unleashed, the first one dealt with some Gothic, Alternative Rock, trip hop and ambient fans. The Second one, brought "The depths" project to life.

Some various appearances : *National radio RTCI *Concerts at "l√©toile du nord" *First edition of "festival de la guitare" *Concerts at "pyramide du lac" *International "World Music" festival at Tabarka
