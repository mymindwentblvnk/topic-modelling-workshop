Black Beast is a finnish black metal band. They formed in 2002 and even though their earlier material could be considered as raw black metal, their newer sound is substantially more calculated and somewhat more melodic. They are currently active and signed to Primitive Reaction Records. With two releases under their belt (Black Beast [EP, 2005] and Unholy Finnish Black Horror Union [Split, 2006]). It is to be noted that the main man (Infernal Tormentor Necrocorpse von Demonblood) is also the owner of Primitive Reaction Records(Beherit, Bloodhammer,Armour,Reverend Bizzare,Azrael Rising, etc). 

The lyrics deal mainly with satanism, blasphemy and chaos.
