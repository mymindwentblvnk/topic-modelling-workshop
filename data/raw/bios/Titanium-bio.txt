There are three bands using the name Titanium:

1. Titanium is a New Zealand boyband formed in 2012, by the Edge FM. The lineup consists of Zac Taylor, Andrew Papas, Jordi Webber, Shaquille Paranihi-Ngauma, Haydn Linsley and T.K Paradza. They released their first single, Come On Home in September, 2012. The song debuted at number one on the NZ charts. Starting September 28th, Titanium toured New Zealand for their 'Come On Home' tour.

2. Titanium was formed in the year 2006. The idea for forming the band came up from Pechur and Ivan. The first line-up of the band was: Goce - Keyboards, Gjorgi (S'klet) - Drums, Vlatko (Decadence) - Bass Guitar, Ivan (Dead Society) - Guitar and Pece (Scattered) - Vocals. As time passed by, there were some line-up changes and that slowed down the process of composing new music. Goce, Gjorgi and Vlatko left the bend. So far, the band had a few gigs across Macedonia. The current line-up is: Pece (Pechur) - Vocals, Ivan - Gutar, Bojan - Keyboards, Marjan (Vlajche) - Drums, Dame - Bass Guitar.

3. Titanium is an Austrian techno group consisting of brothers Felipe & Nicolas Bacher. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Titanium">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
