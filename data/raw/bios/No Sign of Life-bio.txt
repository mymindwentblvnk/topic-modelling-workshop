Biography:

NSOL is one of the most exciting modern metal bands out there and even though they musically are rooted in the metal genre, the band draws on influences and elements from all over the music field.

Rising from the small town of Laukaa in Finland, NSOL has managed to create a wide fanbase globally, but especially in their homeland. In the band’s lifespan they have celebrated victories and final ranks in most of the top band competitions in Finland, sold thousands of pieces of their demo CD’s and even got one of their demos distributed in Japan, to name a few things. In 2010 they released the debut album “Chaotic Type of Normality”, which followed with a lot of touring, mostly within the Finland, but outside the borders as well. NSOL sees that the biggest satisfaction comes from creating the music and performing it live, and the new album “Embrace Your Demons” is where you truly are hearing the sound of NO SIGN OF LIFE.

“Embrace Your Demons” is not a concept album. It is an album full of stories about inner demons and point of views that should be spoken about. The band has finally found the perfect balance between the epic melodies and the earthshaking rage they always have had in them, and also the space for everything else. NO SIGN OF LIFE’s music has always included various different elements that are not usually heard in metal music. Those elements, all tied up with powerful groove, is the factor that makes NSOL a completely unique group in todays metal music field. Demons inside are waking up. Are you ready to face them? -Jacob/Mighty Music
