Project of Dan Clark (The Mighty Chouffe, Justin Vernon's Goddamn Cabin, The Dark Clan, Stromkern, am.pscyh, Ego Likeness, and The Gothsicles) and Dave Norman (Lockjaw, ex-Dark Clan), Magma Dragon is intended to fuse badass american headbanging riffs with fucking epic-ass euro power metal. Sharpen your sword and prepare for battle.

"We make metal music about swords, dragons, wizards, heroes and conquering armies. Shit that MATTERS."

Dan Clark plays all the guitars, keys, lead vocals, and programming. Dave Norman is the drummer. The rest of band is made up of: Brent Leubner on bass, and Mercy Skye also on keys and vocals.
