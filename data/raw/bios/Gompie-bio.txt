Gompie is a Dutch novelty act, after an idea by Dutch rock 'n roller and entrepreneur, Peter Koelewijn. Gompie was named after a caf√© where the DJ would play the track 'Living Next Door to Alice'. He would put the volume down and the crowd would shout "Alice? Who the fuck is Alice!?". 

The Gompie version of the song, 'Alice Who The X Is Alice' was an unlikely #1 chart topper in The Netherlands in 1995. Koelewijn recorded an Ajax version of the song when AFC Ajax won the UEFA Champions League a couple of months later: 'Who The F**K is Bayern, Hajduk en Milan'. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gompie">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
