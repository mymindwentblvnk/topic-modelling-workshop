Founded in 2000 by Cain and producer / songwriter Philip Faith, RISE OF THE FALLEN is a gathering, a celebration to the light still to be restored. RISE OF THE FALLEN proposes powerful Orchestral sound scapes evolving around post-modern electro rhythms, ancestral tribal rites and hell driven guitars slashing their way through primordial chaos.Industrial injected apocalyptic metal...with dark cavernous vocals.Emerging from the catacombs of the British post-punk era, growing up with great innovators such as cabaret voltaire, einsturzende neubauten P.Faith wanted to create a project that had the intensity of the pre-computerized music blended with modern electro textures without falling in any cliches..Anchored with a heavy guitar sound.The lyrics are predominant and the songs are built around classical structure .
