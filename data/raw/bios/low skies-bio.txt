Low Skies was an American Indie-Rock band from Chicago, Illinois. Their sound was described as "consisting of moody, atmospheric rock with a strong country and desert-rock influence." The band formed in 2000 after a chance meeting between drummer Jason Creps and guitarist/vocalist Christopher Salveter.  After deciding to record together, they played with a number of local musicians before settling on a permanent lineup with Jacob Ross on guitar, Brandon Ross on bass and Luther Rochester on keyboards. Low Skies self-released their first EP prior to signing with Flameshovel Records in 2002.

Their debut full-length, The Bed, was released in 2003. After completing their first real tour as a fully formed band in the fall of 2003, Low Skies entered the studio and ended up with recording the 2004 critically acclaimed EP "I Have Been to Beautiful Places." Low Skies supported acts such as Neko Case and Okkervil River. In 2006 they completed their sophomore LP, "All the Love I Could Find". Shortly after wrapping up the recording sessions, Rochester and the band parted ways. About 2007 the band split. In the meantime songwriter Chris Claiborne Salveter has formed Judson Claiborne.
