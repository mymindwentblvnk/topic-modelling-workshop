Bill and Cody began playing music together nearly a decade ago. After many projects were held together and separately, they began writing together again with no intention of anything coming of it. To their surprise, the song ideas were coming out faster than they could keep up with. 

That's when they agreed that they would try to take this new approach and avoid all the standard pit falls that come with forming a new band. To put it simply, if the music is not fun and does not compel the band, then the point is being missed entirely. Of course that fucking failed miserably and now we're constanly fighting and at eachothers throats. But it makes for good songs. 
A mutual friend introduced Bill and Cody to Drew and the inevitable jam sessions began. After several months, Drew was asked to join the "project" as it had been dubbed. Thus was the start of Pride Subject. 

With Pride Subject now three members strong, it was time to locate a bass player and singer with as little self-respect as the rest of us. That's when Aaron came along. Shortly thereafter, Scott was forced to join the band as well. 

Pride Subject spent most of 2007 getting the band started, finalizing a lineup and starting the song writing / recording process. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pride+Subject">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
