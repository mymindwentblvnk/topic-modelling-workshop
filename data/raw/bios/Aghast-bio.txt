There are several bands & artists named Aghast:

1) Aghast was a dark ambient project by Nebelhexë aka Andréa Nebel and Nacht aka Tania Stene. They released one album  in 1994 on Cold Meat Industry "Hexerei Im Zwielicht Der Finsternis". This obscure, ghostly and semi-Satanic album made quite an impact at the time. Aghast created haunting, howling and sinister sounds, that managed to freak out even experienced horror movie fans and even Hollywood actors, such as Megan Fox, who reported that the music made them turn on the light and look under the bed. Naturally, this album impressed the extreme music scene, where it reached cult status. Due to Andrea's involvement in the film industry, Aghast's music was used several times in subcultural Horror films such as the Sci-Fi movie Regression, the horror film The Specter, and the horror film Sinister by Hollywood director Scott Derrickson (The Exorcism of Emily Rose) with actor Ethan Hawke.
