Amazingly, Darlene Love, a superb vocalist, hasn't had much of a track record as a solo singer, at least not in terms of hits. Love was a founding member of the Blossoms in 1957. They did several sessions and were resident singers on the television show Shindig. Love sang lead vocals on " He's a Rebel," which was credited to the Crystals, and "Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah," which was issued as Bob B. Soxx and the Bluejeans. She cut six singles for Phil Spector's Phillies label, with " Wait Till My Bobby Gets Back Home" the most successful. Love became busy as an actress, but reunited with Spector for the 1977 single " Lord, If You're a Woman." Love appeared in all four Lethal Weapon films, and was also in the Royal Shakespeare Company's co-production of Stephen King's Carrie. Her 1990 LP, Paint Another Picture, failed to chart in America. Love later toured as a background vocalist with Cher. She appeared briefly on the soap opera Another World in 1993.
