ENTERING THE STUDIO

We're about to enter Rock Society Studios to record the first full lenght, to be released on fall/winter 2010.

We're working with Roberto Cufaro, founder of Theatre Des Vampires and VII Arcano, who will manage the whole sounds.

Soon to be streamed "Recording - Behind the scenes"...
...so....
STAY TUNED
