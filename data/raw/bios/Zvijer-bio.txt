Born long time ago in the city of Anderva. Since young age he thought that life is impossible without music, or maybe his mind was just messin' with him. Anyway, music experiments made him famous around the world (that he built himself). Well known for his inappropriate behaviour and agressive nature. As a very talented musician (in his mind) he started recording music that did not make any sence, merging different genres together. He called that music cocktail Å ljatrakam. Few months later some strange songs popped out and  he decided to publish album under the name "Bidon"  (English: "Can"). Bidon is full of music mix kept at a certain temperature and pressure. Founder and guitarist of Satresaci Tisine. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Zvijer">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
