Parole are a four-piece doom / sludge/crust band comprised of members from Coventry and Leamington Spa, United Kingdom. Formed in 2009, they cite poverty, pain, death, weakness, addiction, violence, hatred, abuse and suffering as their influences. A five track EP titled simply ‘PAROLE’ was released on October 11th 2009, and has so far recieved positive feedback from most listeners. These guys create an awesomely rancid mix of eyehategod’s groove-injected riffery and fierce hardcore-infused sludge vocals, pouring forth filth and ferocity, As said in zero tolerance magazine. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Parole">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
