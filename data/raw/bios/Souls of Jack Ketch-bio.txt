Souls of Jack Ketch were born from the ashes of various metal and hardcore bands in the north east of England. Formed at the beginning of 2012, all of the members brought various influences which forged the sound of the band today.

These include old school Thrash to Hardcore Punk incorporating an essence of Death and Doom. There are many more that can be named, but the band are all about playing it heavy, loud and live!

Souls of Jack Ketch are a close knit unit that operate with a no-compromise attitude. The energy that the band delivers is reflected in the feedback given by fans and promoters. The band essentially just want to get out there and play as many gigs as possible to introduce themselves to all those who love metal!

We have already met some amazing fans and bands along the way, and eagerly await what the future holds.
