Infinite Redemption (IR) is a Black/Thrash metal band from Mumbai, India.

Unforgotten and unforgiving, this is basically what IR mostly talk about through their music. 

Many of us today, talk about the atrocities that we or rather a common man faces. From politics to corruption, from terrorism to inhumanity and all the jazz involved. In this bargain, we often forget what we’ve already been through or rather those things that have already happened and gone back in time. Bringing back the period, the events, which have already gone by in time but still some where down in everyone’s heart and mind, those memories are still present. Those memories are old and forgotten, like an old and aged, rusted chunk of iron.

Infinite Redemption believes in keeping the agony alive. Bringing back to life, the memories of the long gone, hatred and angst is what IR trying to achieve. Hence the genre is defined as Rust Metal.

Infinite Redemption is : 

Rust - Vocals
Heith - Lead Guitars
Katas - Rhythm Guitars/Vocals
Amey - Bass
Nandan - Drums

Here is the sampler to their upcoming EP, which is produced by Vishal J. Singh (Amogh Symphony)
