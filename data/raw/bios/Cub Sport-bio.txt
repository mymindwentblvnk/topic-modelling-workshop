Another new single, "Pool!," was released in March 2013. The band officially changed their name to Cub Sport in August 2013 before releasing new single "Paradise." 

In 2016, the band released their debut album, entitled This Is Our Vice. Two singles have been released from the album - "I Can't Save You" and "Come On Mess Me Up." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cub+Sport">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
