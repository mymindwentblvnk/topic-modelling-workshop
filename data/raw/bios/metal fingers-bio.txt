Metal Fingers is one of the many alter-egos taken on by Hip-Hop artist MF DOOM.  All of Metal Finger's works are instrumental, and are released in "volumes," each one being called "Special Herbs."  The title of each track on the 10 "Special Herbs" volumes is named after a herb or flora.  There is some confusion among the titles of the albums, because of how they overlap with previous volumes.  For instance, "Special Herbs, Vol. 2" actually contains its predecessor, "Special Herbs, Vol. 1," as the first 9 tracks of the album.  A similar overlap occurs with vol. 4 (including 3 as well), but later releases tend to combine volumes and say such in the title. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Metal+Fingers">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
