Misery Index is an American death metal band formed in 2001 in Baltimore, Maryland by Jason Netherton (bass, vocals), Mike Harrison (guitar, vocals) and Kevin Talley (drums). Some say the band is named after Assück's last album of the same name (1996), however the socio-political theme featured in many of the lyrics also point towards the economic term (both increasing inflation and unemployment result in the rise of the misery index). As of 2010, its line-up consists of Jason Netherton (bass, vocals), Darin Morris (guitar), Mark Klöppel (guitar) and Adam Jarvis (drums). The band released their most recent album "Rituals of Power" on March 8, 2019 via Season of Mist records.

Their music is best described as death metal with strong hardcore and grindcore influences. Their vein of music is often said to resemble their fellow Maryland death metal outfit Dying Fetus, as Netherton and (former guitarist) Voyles are former members of the band. Misery Index's lyrical subjects focus mostly on the ills of modern society.
