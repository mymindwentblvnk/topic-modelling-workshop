Cocytus is a Dark Ambient project from Australia, which is also the reincarnation of the Chinese / Beijing Dark Ambient act known as IHVHLXXII. 

After moving to Australia, the artist re-released 'Dtxenioutha' (originally on Dying Art Productions) on his own label. The music is based on the Occult with a basis of infantile autism. 

There is also a death thrash band out of Kenosha, WI named Cocytus. They were active from April 2006-December 2009. They released a demo entitled "Demo 2006" and an EP entitled Pestilence. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cocytus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
