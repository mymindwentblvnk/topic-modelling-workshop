"Quick Fix - Rat Race EP debut with a panic attack on your record player with some booze-fueled-hate-gore as you would see in a 80's slasher flick. Taking queues from Damaged-era-Flag, It's-Alive-Ramones, and adding a dose of classic midwest hardcore ala Negative Approach and the Fix. Get Pissed!"- Records of the Damned  

3. Punk band from Sydney, Australia.    https://quickfixshc.bandcamp.com/
