Es La Guerilla was a French band from Paris. Formerly known as a hardcore band, they played a southern-metal/sludgecore that Crowbar fans may enjoy. Some members of the band now play in the southern-metal band Hangman's Chair. 

In early 2010, a East-European reunion tour was announced. Unfortunately, guitar player Sid Ahmed died in February. A gig in honor to his memory is planned in Paris on March 11th, where Guerilla will share the stage with Hangman's Chair, L'esprit du clan, Knockoutz and various guests from the French scene. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Es+la+Guerilla">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
