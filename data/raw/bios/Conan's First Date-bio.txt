Conan’s First Date incarnated in the city of Szentendre in late 2008. Tuned down to the ground, touched by various influences, CFD delivers a modern, catchy, dynamic but yet brutal, complex and traditional metal music involving elements from death and thrash as well as from stoner and southern rock. Such bands would come to mind as machine head, BLS, soilwork, entombed, nevermore or pantera. The very first record of the band was self-made and gained success around the Hungarian rock and metal media. One of the most frequented webzine of Hungary, heavymetal.hu labeled CFD as the ‘already one of the biggest surprises of 2009’, while other magazines also concordantly agreed that this shouldn’t stay inside the walls of the country. Since the summer of 2009 the band is promoted by Powerground management, which supplies local, but widely successful bands such as Watch My Dying, Slytract or Cadaveres. Effigies consist of two different materials including the first recording, ‘The Werewolf Rising’. This ‘double EP’ is an essential record leading from the heavyweight mayhem of Killing Machine to the floating space trip of Million Miles From Home, a cover song from the 90s rave/techno act, Dune. The self-productive effort of the band became stronger as the band created its first video without any involvement of an outside production studio. The video was shot for the song ‘The Werewolf Rising’ from the identically titled debut EP.
