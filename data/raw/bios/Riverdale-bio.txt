1. Riverdale (Montevideo, Uruguay)

Charged with pop-punk hooks and melodies, along with perceptive and thoughtful lyrics, the band brings a taste of something new to the music scene in Montevideo. With a brand new Ep in hand, Riverdale is set to take their craft one step further and expose themselves to as much audience as they can.

With Nicol√°s Moreno, on vocals and bass; David Lazar, on guitar and back-up vocals; Manuel Curiel, on lead guitar; and Felipe Magnani, on drums, the band takes the year 2010 as a challenge and plans to tour as much as possible, rocking their way up to the top. After all, this is what Riverdale is all about: four friends making music and loving every minute of it.
