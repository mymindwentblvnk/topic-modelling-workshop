Eyes Adrift is a rock supergroup consisting of Curt Kirkwood (vocals and guitar, currently with the reformed Meat Puppets), Krist Novoselic (vocals and bass, formerly of Nirvana) and Bud Gaugh (drums, formerly of Sublime). They released an eponymous album (see below) of country influenced rock in 2002, taking all of their previous backgrounds and putting them together. After a period of extensive touring they later broke up (in 2003).

Kirkwood and Gaugh would team up again for the one off project Volcano which produced one limited edition self-titled album.
