This Scottish trio offered a commercial, beautiful, dreamy expression of the early 90's UK obsession with spacey ambient "chill out" music, as practiced by The Orb and Sven VÃ¤th among others.

Fronted by vocalist Dot Allison, One Dove released five singles (including "Why Don't You Take Me", "Breakdown" and "White Love") plus had their song "Fallen" featured in the soundtrack to the trashy cult classic "Showgirls". They released their sole album Morning Dove White in 1993.

After they aborted the recording of a second album in 1995, Dot Allison went on to have a respectable solo career further exploring the sounds of electronica and electroclash; Ian Carmichael went on to be a remixer/producer for various artists including Manchester band Lamb. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/One+Dove">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
