Blue Judy is a four-piece indie rock band from Los Angeles with a flair for intense vocals over upbeat, danceable arrangements. Singer Gustavo Galindo, guitarist Joe Walker, and bassist Luke Benedum met and started Blue Judy while attending college in Claremont, CA. Following the success of fellow Claremont-brewed indie acts We Are Scientists and Speechwriters LLC, the band moved to Los Angeles and continued to develop their writing and performing styles. A change in the drum seat brought recent music school graduate Brian Zarlenga into the band, solidifying a strong rhythmic foundation in their sound.

In April 2006, Blue Judy finished their second self-released recording, "The Common and Continual Mischiefs". The EP, produced by Heroes and Villains Productions (Dan Burns and Billy Mohler), features five original songs in which Galindo's uniquely addictive voice flourishes over a dual-guitar-driven sound that ranges from celestial melodies to pure chaos.

Blue Judy was recently featured on SiTV's rockumentary/reality show "Jammin", which included a private rehearsal with The Doors drummer John Densmore. The program showcased Blue Judy's headlining performance at The Viper Room, exposing a national audience to their high-energy live show. In addition to The Viper Room, they've played at a variety of high-profile clubs around Hollywood including House of Blues, The Key Club, and The Mint.

Blue Judy's relentless 2007 gigging schedule will continue to bring them all over Los Angeles as well as regional SoCal locations to expand upon a growing fan base. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Blue+Judy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
