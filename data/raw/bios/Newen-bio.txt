Newen is embodied in a time of sounds caged by the metallic sound of the city, in an era of minds imprisoned by progress and spirits lost by the weariness of the times ....... even with chains that give us superhuman strength When they are no longer ... we raise our arms and voices and we join the beat of the machine and the dry blow of bare hands, the cry of rage and the shamanic voice that remembers, the metal strings of the new world and the Resounding echo of what was ..... all together, between Sansara and Nirvana, karma and Dharma ..... trapped between ages, bloodsheds, suns, tribulations, oblivion and memory ... NeweN rises !! Newen remembers !!, Newen recovers !! And his inevitable death will bring a new cycle to reach the immovable destiny of everything created, to emanate life from death, to create death through life !!!! With all our rage !!! With all our lack !!!! With all our impotence !!! With all our Newen !!!
