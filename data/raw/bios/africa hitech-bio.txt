Africa Hitech is an electronic music project consisting of Mark Pritchard and Steve Spacek. They released their first EP Blen on 19th April 2010 and a second, Hitecherous, on 28 June 2010. Their debut album 93 Million Miles was released on May 16, 2011. 

Pritchard is probably best known as half of the '90s ambient duo Global Communication (he also produces as Harmonic 313). Spacek first made a splash 10 years ago with his own rnb group, simply called Spacek, and since then has worked solo and in projects like Space Invadas (he also happens to be the brother of drum & bass artist D-Bridge). The two producers first teamed up as Africa Hitech at the Red Bull Music Academy in 2007 and have put out two EPs for Warp since then, both of which flirt with elements of dubstep, grime and funky. All of the tracks on 93 Million Miles are previously unreleased, except for Out in the Streets, which is available as of today through Bleep. 

Africa Hitech embodies its membersâ€™ passions for an eclectic diaspora of electronic styles, from soul, dub and acid to UK garage, grime, techno, house and Jamaican dancehall. Mark Pritchard and Steve Spacek stand at the intersection of all these styles and the result is a synthesizer fuelled syncopated percussion and bass madness.
