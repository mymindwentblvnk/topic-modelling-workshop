A collective featuring Brad Weber of Caribou, Angus Fraser of Tenth of May, Dan Roberts ex-Winter Equinox and Clint Scrivener.

"A fusion of styles can be a tough thing to pull off effectively, yet Pick A Piper manages to push the realm of both splendor and mayhem like some sonic rite of passage. A combination of neo-psychedelic dream-pop and tribal-fueled double-drumming explodes into a torrent of live-energy where an Afro-Brazilian celebration meets pop-loving hearts."
- Lonely Vagabond

Pick a Piper are known for their sweaty, energetic live shows, where audience members become a part of the band by the time the set has finished.  

The band recently filmed a video in Iceland (and a bit in Canada) for their single "Rooms", which can be viewed here: http://www.vimeo.com/7417034
