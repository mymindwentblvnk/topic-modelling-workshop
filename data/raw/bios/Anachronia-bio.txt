AnachroniA is a Beauty & Beast band from France with folk influence.
Their debut album was released in 2004 and carries the name The Endless Agony. This is a nine track album with a storyline basically dealing with how insanity is drowning the character to his/her end, revisiting the character's life and mankind's fate.

As you can read from the line-up the band is educated on a lot of instruments, with the result of this being an album without a dull moment. 

Highly recommended!
