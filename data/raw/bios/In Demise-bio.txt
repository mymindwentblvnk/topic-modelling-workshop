In Demise is a Berlin based band which plays Technical Death Metal and was founded in early 2005.
After slightly changing their style from melodic to rather progressive and replacing their singer, they played several gigs in Berlin and outside of Berlin, including gigs with Defeated Sanity and Cerebric Turmoil as well as the "Filthrock Festival 2006" with Behemoth, Dark Fortress, Sanatorium and more. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/In+Demise">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
