Killdozer are an American band that formed in Madison, Wisconsin in 1983, with members Bill Hobson, Dan Hobson and Michael Gerald. They took their name from the 1974 TV movie directed by Jerry London, itself based on a Theodore Sturgeon short story. They released their first album, Intellectuals are the Shoeshine Boys of the Ruling Elite, in the same year. The band split in 1990 but reformed in 1993, losing Bill Hobson and gaining Paul Zagoras, and continued until they split up in 1996. The band released 9 albums, including a post-breakup live CD, The Last Waltz, released in 1997.

Killdozer was a one-of-a-kind band, notable for its erotic songs, and its serious but not-so serious lyrics about the hardships of working in a circus, sung by singer Michael Gerald at the top of his lungs. Many of the lyrics dealt with disturbing narratives from the circus freak sideshow, or about his relationship with the bearded lady. The band also became famous for its uproarious cover songs, the most memorable of all being Don McLean's "American Pie". A version exists on their 1989 all-covers album For Ladies Only.

Killdozer is regarded by many to have set the foundation for grunge music, in spite of that genre's association with the city of Seattle. The band were stalwarts of Touch and Go Records during its legendary 1980s phase and they often toured with or played alongside stablemates such as Scratch Acid and Big Black. Steve Albini, who recorded Killdozer's 1995 album God Hears Pleas of the Innocent, has on many occasions cited Killdozer as a band who reach his exacting standards.
