As the final nails were hammered to the coffin of Reverend Bizarre (1995-2007, R.I.P.), guitar player Peter Vicar - nowadays going with his real name Kimi Kärki - started to follow his vision of a new Doom Metal band. He felt forced to fulfill his need to compose and play this most arcane form of metal in the way it was meant to be, full of intensity, cruelty, heaviness, and force. Still firmly walking in the footsteps of Saint Vitus, Trouble, Witchfinder General, Pentagram and The Obsessed, this new band brings together an international lineup of four devoted metalheads, who have experience from a long list of bands, such as Saint Vitus, Reverend Bizarre, Count Raven, Terra Firma, Centurions Ghost, Orne, End of Level Boss, Umbra Nihil, E-Musikgruppe Lux Ohr, Weekend Beast and The Path is Clear.

Chritus - Vocals
Kimi Kärki - Guitars
