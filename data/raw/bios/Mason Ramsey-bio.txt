Mason Ramsey is an 11-year-old singing sensation who captured worldwide attention as the “Walmart Yodeling Boy.” His grandfather Ernest Ramsey says Mason started singing when he started talking. They would listen to the songs of Hank Williams Sr. down in the basement.

He sang for Josh Turner at the Carson Center at age 4, opened for Gene Watson at age 5, and started playing the guitar at age 6. He also sang with Kenny Rogers on a Christmas TV show when he was 7. He had his first performance at the Stars & Steel Guitars show at the Benton Civic Center. Mason is a member of the Stars of Tomorrow Show at the Kentucky Opry.

Mason is rising fast in the music business. He still lives with his wonderful grandparents and attends grade school in Golcanda, Illinois.
