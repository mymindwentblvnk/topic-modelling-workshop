Deletion was formed in Göteborg, Sweden late spring 2005 and consists of experienced members from bands such as Dissection, SoulReaper, Taetre and Thornium. The music is dark death metal, with a patina from black metal.

In the beginning of 2006, Deletion recorded the first demo and contacted Painkiller Records. Painkiller liked the songs and decided to make a full album. And after much blood and hate the recording was completed. 

The release date for the album has been set for June 2, 2008.
