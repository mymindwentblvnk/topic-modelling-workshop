Kilo Kish is an alternative R&B singer, songwriter, and occasional rapper who has recorded with the Jet Age of Tomorrow, the Internet, Vince Staples, Gorillaz, Childish Gambino, and Chet Faker, among others. She has also released her own material. 

Born Lakisha Robinson in Orlando, Florida, she spent part of her childhood in New Jersey prior to returning to Orlando and was briefly in a pop group called D'Angelz. She moved to New York, attended the Pratt Institute, and worked as a model and waiter.

Led by the dreamy "Navy," her first EP, Homeschool, was self-released in April 2012. A couple years later, after assorted collaborative work, she connected with the music wing of French fashion label Kitsuné for Across, another EP of atmospheric, slackened R&B. In 2015, she appeared on Etienne de Crécy's Super Discount 3 and Vince Staples' Summertime '06. Reflections in Real Time, a sprawling and deeply personal album that flitted between fully developed songs and fragmentary interludes, followed in February 2016. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kilo+Kish">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
