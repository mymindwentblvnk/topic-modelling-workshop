Right now there are 4 bands with the name TENEMENT.
One is located in
(1) Berlin (Germany),
another one in
(2) Dundee (Scotland), another from 
(3) Neenah/ Appleton, Wisconsin (United States), and finally one 
(4) Bristol (England).
They are all playing different kind of music:

(1)  tenement (Germany): Indie/Rock/Pop
(2)  Tenement (Scotland): Rock/Indie/Punk
(3)  TENEMENT (United States):
Hailing from Appleton, TENEMENT play punk-rock similar to the more melodic side of SST spliced with the early sound of the Twin Cities. A beautiful mix of early Hüsker Dü’s ferocity, DINOSAUR JR's guitar soloing and distortion, and THE REPLACEMENTS youthful energy, TENEMENT stand out in a modern-era by focusing on great and original songwriting that made these other aforementioned bands so special.
