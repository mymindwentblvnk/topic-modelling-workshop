blood will tell

12 years ago, when bloodphemy released their first promo, did several gigs and gained a serious amount of interest before being forced into a silent death, we all knew they'd come backâ€¦

today that has become reality and bloodphemy is back stronger than ever! 

for the last couple of months 3 original members, edwin nederkoorn, winfred koster and wicliff wolda, have been working hard on writing new material and realising a variety of artistic ideas which soon will see the light of day.

apart from the old, there's some new blood as well; arnold oudemiddendorp (devious, altar, bleeding gods) will vocalise our bloody tracks while rutger van noordenburg (cavitation, shinigami) will make your ears bleed with his ripping lead guitars.

expect some raw industrialised death with a whiff of insanity coming your way before the end of this year. meanwhile you can enjoy the re-recorded version of bloodphemy's "blood for me". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bloodphemy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
