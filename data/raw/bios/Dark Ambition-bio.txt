Death/black metal band from South Korea (Seoul). 

Dark Ambition's music style is rooted in twin guitar melodies and Melodic Death, however the music encompasses a wide range of metal genres including Black, Gothic and Thrash. The unique characteristics of Korean melody and atmosphere can be heard in their music as well. Although using traditional music elements, the band's motivation remains to play heavy metal. Each song on the album has a distinct character and fans have been anticipating the fusion with traditional instruments in the new songs.

Rather than a bland mix of various kinds of music, Dark Ambition searches for the essential characteristics of each genre and incorporates them into the whole. They don't limit themselves to only a Korean sentiment ; various influences are cited in their music, while they strive to ensure the result remains a cohesive work. The song concepts are about opposing the absurd, social resistance, inquiry into the self or suppression of the weak. Among these concepts runs a strong promise of hope in the future.
