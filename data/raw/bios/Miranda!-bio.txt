Miranda! is an Argentinean electropop band formed in 2002.
Band members include Alejandro Sergi (vocals), Juliana Gattas (vocals), Lolo Fuentes (guitar) and Bruno de Vicenti(programming, who later on left the band. Now they are also performing with Monoto, the new bassist.

The History of Miranda! begins in 2002, when Alejandro Sergi decided to join Juliana Gattas, Lolo Fuentes and Bruno de Vicentis and start a "techno pop" music band, though they were classified as a rock band. When they began to play around the Buenos Aires Underground, they started playing their music in different places, making their number of followers grow at each performance.

Their first CD was Es Mentira (Spanish for It's a Lie). It consisted of ten songs.
In 2004 Miranda! edited their second studio album, called Sin Restricciones (Without Restrictions), made up of twelve songs, including Yo te diré (I'll Tell You), Don (Gift) El Profe (The Teacher) and Navidad (Christmas) as its highlights.

The band was named after the Argentinian actor Osvaldo Miranda. Since the band began playing, they wanted to meet Osvaldo Miranda. This finally took place during the Buen Día Arriba festival, in December 2002, in a bar near a park at Palermo Viejo.

The band combines love themes, nice ballads, and electronic waltzes mixed with some of sexual desire, creating very dance-able songs and carefully prepared shows.

There is a big controversy regarding the sexual content in some of Miranda!'s songs' lyrics, mostly in El Profe ("The Teacher" in English) – which was released as a single; and is about a male teacher fantasizing about sexualy abusing one of his female students, probably suggesting pedophilia in the verse "Quisiera que me mientas cuando pregunte tu edad" (I wish you would lie to me when I ask you your age) and also "Quiero que te toques para mi, quiero tocarme y acabar en ti" (I want you to touch yourself for me, I want to touch me and end up on you).
