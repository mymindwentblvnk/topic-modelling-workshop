Roach Gigz is an American rapper and hip hop artist from the San Francisco Bay Area. Gigz released his first major mixtape in 2010, entitled Roachy Balboa. He runs his own label, Goomba.

In 2006, Gigz started rapping in his closet with a microphone, and started to create his own hip hop songs, which were liked by his peers. He first gained fame locally after forming a hip hop duo called B.I.G. with rapper Lil 4Tay. Roach Gigz was given the nickname due to his resemblance to a character from the movie Next Friday named Roach.

In May 2010, Gigz released his first major mixtape entitled Roachy Balboa, which received much airplay on Bay Area radio station 106.1 KMEL. Pitchfork described the mixtape as "one of the most energetically fun rap records released this year." Gigz was selected to be one of KMEL's Top 10 Freshman Rappers of the Bay Area. In November 2010, he released his single "Can I Rap". A music video for the song was uploaded onto YouTube and has received over one million views.
