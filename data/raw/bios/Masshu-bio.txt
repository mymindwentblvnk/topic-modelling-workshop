Masshu plays dark and compelling music that deals with Satanic symbolism and occultism. The name Masshu refers to a mystical mountain in Sumerian/Babylonian mythology that symbolized the gateway to the underworld or the "Abyss". In some occult texts, it is the lurking place of the worshipers of the "The Great Dragon", Tiamat/Leviathan; representing primeval Chaos. The "Ancient Serpent" called the Devil, or Satan.

Originally formed in Phoenix Arizona, the band was conceptualized by guitarist and vocalist, Storm, in the summer of 1996. Later, joined by drummer Genocide, Masshu recorded "Into The Darkness" in 1997, which the band produced themselves. It took until 1999 for "Into The Darkness" to be released, but it still stands as a great Black Metal recording. Not typical of the American Black Metal scene. 

Storm is now the sole member of Masshu and has released a mini CD called "Pandaemonium". The title refers to the abode of all demons in Milton's "Paradise Lost." It is the place built by Satan's orders, as the capital of Hell. The CD features three new songs and two previously unreleased demo versions of songs from the "Into The Darkness" CD. Currently Masshu is compiling new material for another recording.
