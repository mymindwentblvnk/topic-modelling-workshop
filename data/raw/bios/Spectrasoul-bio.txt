Since their emergence in 2006, SpectraSoul have carved a truly unique position, not only in Drum & Bass, but electronic music as a whole. Beautifully deep and etched with groove yet powerful enough to move any dancefloor, SpectraSoul's stunning musical productions are a far cry from the soulless, synthetic rave fodder so many unfortunately associate with Drum & Bass today. Their creative evolution has seen them incorporate such a variety of tempos and moods - bending genres in the process - yet their underlying sound remains instantly recognisable, and in many ways unique.

2016 saw the duo spread their wings and launch their very own label, Ish Chat Music. With the release of three EPs in twelve months, they drastically upped the frequency and diversity of their output, with experimental tracks sitting alongside straight up club music. 001 to 003 garnered wide-ranging support from Radio 1and Beats 1 and from a variety of highly respected music media outlets such as DJ Mag, MixMag, Resident Advisor.

The final quarter of 2017 will see the release of their third studio album, ‘How We Live’; the fourth release on their own imprint. The album is an exploration of the underground sonic pallette and a return to the core ideals that formed the drum and bass genre; uncompromising, energetic, experimental and danceable. The duo, in their trademark fashion, straddle the varying styles within the genre and showcase, once again, the diversity of their production capabilities. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Spectrasoul">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
