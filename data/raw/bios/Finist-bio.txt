FINIST - A project started by Saturious of Nokturnal Mortum, which came to light with the release of “Crosses Shall Burn” in 2002. A fusion of Black Metal, Folk, Power Metal, and Ukrainian Nationalism themes. Very powerful sound ranging from mellow verses to screeching choruses, bring new light to the Ukrainian NSBM scene. With the new album “Awakening”, released in the end of 2005, they improve upon their formula. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Finist">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
