Formed at the end of 2004, the members of Barred had all grown up in the same small town in Southwest Wisconsin. The original three members: Dan Wheelock (Guitar), Tyler Johnson (Vocals), and Stephen Bradford (Drums) started out playing an assortment of punk, thrash, and classic metal covers. Beginning to write their own material, their first songs were heavily influenced by early thrash bands. The band went on to pick up Roman Fletcher (Bass) to complete the line up. Having lost interest in the band, Fletcher's place in the band was filled by Josh Cooke. Near the end of their time together, the group had evolved into an amalgam of thrash, hardcore, and sludge. After graduation, relocations and new musical projects have limited the activity of the band. Wheelock and Cooke went on to join Guilty of Destruction, with Bradford later joining Slob Donovan. The first demo the band produced, "Thrash Metal Revival," was recorded in August of 2005. The first version of "Beyond This Point" was recorded in the band's practice space at Wheelock's garage in the summer of 2007, which the band went on to re-record in Bradford's basement in spring of 2009. The selections from "Beyond This Point" are, as of yet, incomplete due to the lack of vocals on all tracks. The band is on indefinite hiatus.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Barred+In+50+States">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
