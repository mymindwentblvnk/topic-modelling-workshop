Concealment are a band based out of Sintra, Portugal. Playing a blend of Progressive Death metal with grindcore since 1995.
Concealment were formed in Sabugo, a small place near Sintra in 1995. The musical style of this band consists of a complex dissonant guitar work, off-time polyrhythmic drummings, unconventional 9 string bass lines and a expressive bleak vocal style. The Concealment's lyrics are based in the coldness of the modern world, the desperation of the present and next generations.
The original line-up of the group consisted of Luis Martins voice/guitar, Pedro Machuco bass, Filipe Correia guitar, David Jeronimo drums. The band was initially inspired by Death/Grind bands like Napalm Death, Carcass, Morbid Angel; and by the experimental/progressive bands like King Crimson, Emerson Lake and Palmer, the earlier Pink Floyd...
In 1998 Pedro Machuco and Luis Martins left the group. Paulo Silva joined the band as the bass player and Filipe Correia became the lead vocalist of Concealment.
In 2001 the band stopped for a hibernate period till 2005.
After the stop the band joined again to compose the EP "...of Malady" the track list are; -Eye, Pandemic, Acanthous, Seance, Utter Sensuous, The Hissing. This work reveals a different musical approach more dynamic, more slower and tense than the other works. 

In 2007 the band released their debut album "Leak".
"Leak" has a little of all Concealment's previous works, from the lugubrious complexity of imperaffection to the dynamics of "...of Malady", and with an extra experimental side. The first promotion of Leak was in the Alta Tens√£o Indoor 2007 with the Danish Metal band Mnemic and portuguese bands Re:aktor and For Gods Fake. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Concealment">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
