Shooting At Unarmed Men was the project of former mclusky member Jon Chapple (guitar/vocals). It had existed as a "sporadical joke" since around 1999, possibly as an outlet for Chapple's songwriting which could not be accommodated by mclusky.  The initial lineup included bassist Simon Alexander of King Alexander (who co-wrote the mclusky song chases); and drummer Steve Morgan.

With Simon Jarvis (of Big Joan) replacing Alexander, they released two albums: Soon There Will Be... in October 2005 and  Yes! Tinnitus! in May 2006, both on mclusky's former label Too Pure.

This line-up played their last gig on April 16th 2006 at Cardiff's Clwb Ifor Bach, at which Chapple sold most of his books, videos and some of his records before emigrating to join his girlfriend in Melbourne, Australia. There he recruited Tom Cooper and Julian Tovey from local band The Cheats, and this line-up played their first gigs at The Tote, Melbourne in October 2006. The album Triptych, a normal-length album split across 3 CDs, was released in August 2007 in Australia, and internationally in March 2008.

Cooper and Tovey then left the group, and Chapple brought in Richmond Brain on bass and Chris Drane on drums. They recorded With The Youthful Energy Of A Zealot in late 2008, before Brain left to be replaced by Drane's bandmate in A Friend Of Mine, Patrick Walker. The album was launched with a gig on January 31st 2009 at The Tote, Melbourne, described on the band's myspace as "LAST EVER SHOW EVER".
