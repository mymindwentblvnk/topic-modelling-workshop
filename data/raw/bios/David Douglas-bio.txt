David Douglas (1983) is a Dutch producer of electronic music. David Douglas (1799) was a Scottish plant hunter who explored North America collecting seeds of plants and trees unknown to mankind at that time. Inspired by the Scottish botanist, David from '83 started looking for his own musical seeds. The greatness of nature – the sublime mountain landscapes, Icelandic lupine fields, arctic coastlines, Californian fir forests – invigorate his music. 

'Royal Horticultural Society' is David’s debut EP although it sounds like anything other than a debut. His music can be described as warm, playful, analog, adventurous, diverse and pure. But most of all as he quotes himself: 'It's electronic music for the mind'.

'David Douglas - Royal Horticultural Society' will be released digitally June 12th.
