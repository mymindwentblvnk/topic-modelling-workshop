There are two artists with the name The Truckers:

1) The rock band The Truckers was formed in Rimouski, Quebec in the summer of 2004 from the ashes of the death-tech-prog band Soul's Pitfall. At the begining, this was only a hobby for Larry and Marcel, then they decided to look for musicians that could perform with the band for a more serious business. They recruited Renaud and David from the Mont-Joli band Sideway and Bobo from Mesh. Pat joined after a couple of weeks. Now with a two vocal action, The Truckers are ready to make their way on the fast lane of the underground. The music can be described as a good mix of grind, mosh, trash and blast beat melodies. Trucker's Vision Part 1, taped and mixed at Studio SP(Astral Gates, Vortex, Foot Clan, Rosemary's Nightmare, and many more) in Rimouski, went out on October 8th 2004, the day of the first gig of the six-pack. Since then, The Truckers played many gigs and with bands such as l'Acad√©mie du Massacre, Leng Tche, Fuck The Facts, Neuraxis, Misery Index, Vortex, Decapitated, Augury, Quo Vadis, Guttermouth, Despised Icon, Ion Dissonance and B.A.R.F. They are now in the process of having all the parts of their Full-length album done. "Get rich or drive tryin'", will be released this fall. They will break up in 2012, after their last show scheduled to december 30th.


2) The Truckers is a stoned doom metal band, consisting of Julius Totaro on guitar and vocals and Christian Qvortrup on drums. They have not released anything yet, but they had a few songs rotating on the net. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Truckers">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
