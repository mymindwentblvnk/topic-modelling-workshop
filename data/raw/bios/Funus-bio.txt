There are 3 bands named Funus: 1.) a black metal band from the Netherlands, 2.) a black metal band from Hungary (since 2007) and 3.) a punk rock band from Trinec in the Czech Republic (since 2009).

1.) FUNUS is known for its own way of creating a dark, yet soothing atmosphere in its musical experience. Where Black Metal reaches its borders, FUNUS travels further and dives into the depths of experimenting with sounds and with its use of instruments in a deviant and disturbing way.

Though - appearently for (some of) the listeners - some serious rumours about the band are swept into the world, FUNUS will always let the listener be guessing which characters are truly behind the band. Why, remains unknown.

Formed in 2006, with debut release "FUNUS" in 2009 and with free single release "ROSEFIELD ROAD" in 2011, FUNUS is making progress at the moment working on its upcoming third release.

2.) Currently has two demos, from 2007 and 2008.
