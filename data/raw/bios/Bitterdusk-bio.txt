Very well executed slow, melancholic Doom the way it was done in the early/mid ninties by bands like Anathema and My Dying Bride but with clean vocals and musically not quite as heavy. A must for fans of Anathema's 'Pentecost III' album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bitterdusk">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
