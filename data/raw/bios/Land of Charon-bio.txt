Land Of Charon (1995 - 2015) was a cult Hungarian underground rock band. They had one demo (Örökmécses) and two albums (Asztrálgép, A Láz). Their music was labelled as "goth" , "dark rock" and "doom rock" but they prefer the tag "occult rock" as the best (yet this label describes more the atmosphere of LOC and not the music, which had nothing to do with the genre of retro doom/hard rock, currently defined as occult rock) 

The music of Land Of Charon is complex, multi-layered and heavily atmospheric rock, sometimes reminiscent of Fields Of The Nephilim, with doom and death metal hints, especially in some vocal deliveries. On their last album, A Láz (The Fever) they obtained a more metallic guitar sound. 

Around 2004-2005, due to personal conflicts and lack of relative success, bandleader-guitarist-singer János Veress "Janeth" put the band on temporary hiatus. 

In the year of 2009 Janeth reformed Land Of Charon, with long-time companions Balázs Holly (bass), Ferenc Énekes (guitars) and Norbert Kovács (drums). They started to play festival and club shows in Hungary and new LOC material was on it's way, too. The death of bandleader Janeth in 2015 has put the band on permanent hiatus and the new, unfinished material has remained shelved.
