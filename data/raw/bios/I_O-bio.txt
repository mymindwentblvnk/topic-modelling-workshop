i_o was one of the aliases of USA-based electronic music producer Garrett Lockhart. Garrett’s very first release under this moniker got him featured on mau5trap’s seventh installment of the We Are Friends compilation and a premiere on renowned electronic music platform Dancing Astronaut, being labelled as “a name to watch going forward”.

Spinnin' also believed in the talent when signing his collaboration with worldwide-famous electro house DJ and producer Tommy Trash, Oxygen, together with Daisy Guttridge as well as his 2019 collaboration with indie singer Grimes.

Before presenting himself under the i_o pseudonym, Lockhart also went by Fawks, having featured releases on popular labels like Dim Mak, DOORN Records and even a remix of Skrillex and The Game’s El Chapo on NEST HQ.

Lockhart passed away on the 23rd of November 2020, at the age of 30. May he rest in Power and his music be forever remembered. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/I_O">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
