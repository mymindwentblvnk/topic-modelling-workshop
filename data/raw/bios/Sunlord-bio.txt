Formed in 2004 by Argentinian vocalist and guitarist Alfonso Ferrazza, Sunlord originally started as a Slayer/Pantera tribute band. This allowed the band to get paid gigs, draw a crowd, and travel around the US. Sunlord's line up changed multiple times over the years, but the first important professional drummer was Tamas Vajda, who was with the band for two years and recorded "The First One " in 2005, Sunlord's only album to date. Szimon Rapacz, a bass for hire of the NYC music scene, was with the band for a while and got to do a great job in the album as well. The band then changed line up again, with Jeff Almeyda at the drums and Ken Huskey at the bass. Sunlord's been rocking the Tri State area and expanding since then, and is currently working on the second album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/SunLord">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
