Crypt Infection was founded in 2009 from the ashes of Encoma and Butchery. Hailing from Ventura, CA, this band's unique flavor of Technical Death Metal has been making waves in the scene. Vocalist Ken May's guttural growls and piercing highs offset Lead Guitarist Joe Billingiere's brilliantly disturbing riff and sweltering solos. With blisteringly fast double bass drums and the occasional gravity blasts from Jeremiah Taylor, the sound is rounded out by their sludgy, precise bassist Mike Payton and Rhythm Guitarist Robert Carter. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Crypt+Infection">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
