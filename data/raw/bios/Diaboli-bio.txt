Diaboli is a Finnish black metal band. It was formed under the name Sigillum Diaboli in 1992, but changed to Diaboli in 1995. The band worked as a 2 man group for years until Hrim Grimn'r committed suicide in 2001, and since then the only member of Diaboli has been Petri "Pete" Ilvespakka. To this day Diaboli has released 7 full-lengths along with 1 EP and a collection of previously unreleased material from the early years.

The members of Diaboli have had violence charges a couple of times. In 1999 Ilvespakka attempted to kill a man with an axe, and by this he was sentenced to 4 years and 6 months in prison. However he was already released in March 2002. Also Grimn'r served a few years in prison in early 2001 for violence charges, before the suicide in June 2001.
