Insanity has always been a dark secret of society; its victims were confined behind padded walls and numbed by Thorazine - shunned by the populous at large as the undesirables. These unfortunates, who were deemed mad by the so-called rational psychologists of the modern age, lingered in a twilight world where all time is lost, the mind is subdued, and the spirit destroyed. The mentally ill have been subjected to the worst crimes humanity has ever imagined and their screams were either ignored or fell upon deaf ears until now.

Out of the dust of the abandoned asylums a force has been unleashed upon the world; the tortured souls of a forgotten past will no longer be content to linger in the shadows. Their combined voices have been made manifest the time for the reckoning has come! Its shape is pure anger. Its sound is absolute violence. Its enmity toward mankind is all consuming. The entity has become a combined power to take vengeance upon the world that had abandoned them. They have become known collectively as Wretched Asylum. Led by the anguished vocals of Phil Smolinsky, and supported by the brutal guitars of Michael Todd, the throbbing bass of Ryan Mix, the haunting electronics of Matt Jennison and the pounding drums of Scot McGurl Wretched Asylum is an industrial metal assault never before experienced. Nothing can prepare you for the madness unleashed onstage nothing can stop the onslaught you can either participate in the mayhem or be consumed by it. What society has sown, the mentally disturbed shall reap! The entire earth will soon know the price of its inhumanity the world will soon know the retribution of Wretched Asylum!
