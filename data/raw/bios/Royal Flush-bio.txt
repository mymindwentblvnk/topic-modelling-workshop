5. There is also a rap group named Royal Flush hailing from Houston, Texas, led by Rick Royal. In their early days they were an extension of the Rap-A-Lot Records -family and even dropped out an LP under J. Prince's wings in '88. The Flush re-emerged in 1991 with their sophomore and at the same time final record 976-Dope which is said to have exerted a great influence on many Southern rappers.
