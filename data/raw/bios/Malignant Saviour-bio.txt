Malignant Saviour was formed by Craig Land (vocals) and Ken Pascoe (guitars, synths) in the Summer of 1995. They began writing songs for their own enjoyment, but became more serious in their endeavours upon the recruitment of Brandon Swales (drums) and Paul Howells (guitar). Malignant Saviour existed as a quartet until mid '96, at which time Howells was asked to leave. Not long afterwards, Pascoe announced that he was emigrating to the U.K. However, the band continued rehearsing with a view to commit all their material to disc. Finally, one afternoon in December 1996 they entered the studio, where they laid down drums, guitars and vocals, live. The following weekend saw a second guitar and vocal track being recorded, as well as synths. The album "Hymns To A God Forgotten", was pressed in a highly limited edition run of just 36, only for the band themselves and their friends. It featured 9 tracks, including a cover. Although never shopped around, there was some label interest, which was dismissed. The album is unavailable, but here is the first opportunity for the world to hear the voice of Malignant Saviour. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Malignant+Saviour">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
