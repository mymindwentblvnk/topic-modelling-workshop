Rukhsana Merrise is a British singer-songwriter from west London. 

In September 2014 she set herself the task of writing, recording and releasing a song every week of the month, and so her “September Songs” EP was born. Released solely on soundcloud, the EP soon clocked up over a quarter of a million plays and brought her to the attention of record label and promoter Communion and also BBC Introducing, who added her track “So They Say” from the EP to their Radio 1 playlist in June 2015.

Rukhsana has toured the UK and Europe with Bear’s Den and supported artists including Jack Garratt, Laura Mvula, James Bay and Leon Bridges. This summer saw her appear at various Festivals including Glastonbury, Somersault and Bushstock.
