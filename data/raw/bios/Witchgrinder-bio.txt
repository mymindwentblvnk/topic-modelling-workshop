The dark metal industrialists WITCHGRINDER rose from the deepest, darkest graves of Melbourne in mid-2009. Bringing you a unique new style of terror, their music is inspired by the 80s metal sound of Metallica mixed with the strong, industrial grooves of Ministry, Rammstein and Static-X; from the classic horror/sci-fi stories that make your skin crawl, their lyrics and samples give a spooky, Rob Zombie/Marilyn Manson feel to the music. WITCHGRINDER have been tearing up the Australian live music scene with their powerful and energetic live performance. May 2010 – WITCHGRINDER will release their debut E.P. “Through the eyes of the dead” which will follow with constant shows and touring. Be sure to come along and watch the monster that is WITCHGRINDER grow!!! "Through the eyes of the dead" and official Merch available online and at live shows.
