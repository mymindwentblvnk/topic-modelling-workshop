Catnapp is an electronic Live Act from Buenos Aires, Argentina, based in Berlin that combines breakbeat, drum and bass, alternative electronic, pop, rapping and other genres, resulting in an intense and nostalgic atmosphere with Fat percussion and lots of treble. Songs run through the simplest girly lyrics with a 4/4 beat to the deepest and scariest childhood memories with huge compressed pads and synths, resulting in a unique sound.
