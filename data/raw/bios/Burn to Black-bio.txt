Continuing in their typical DIY aesthetic, Toronto’s Burn To Black follows up 2004’s self-recorded and produced demo with its full-length debut, Mach 666 (Urgent Music Records). Since forming in 2002, the band - Mike Krestel, Paul Harrington, Robin Ouellette, Evan Johnston and Sam Dunn (director of Metal: A Headbanger’s Journey) - has always done things its own way. From recording and producing to mixing and album art, the approach has always been that if you want something done right, you’d better do it yourself. Burn To Black has now established itself as a force in Canada’s metal scene with a highly praised live experience that shows a band clearly enjoying itself without sacrificing the tightness that one would expect from a metal band of these times. The band now has their sights set on bringing its death/black/thrash n’ roll to as many people as possible. Check out Mach 666 which hit stores on October 31st, 2006.
