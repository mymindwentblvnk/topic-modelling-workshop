Shrouded came to life on September 20th, 2008. Three days later, the first four song demo was completed.

This project was the idea of Elektrokutioner (Decrepitaph/Skincrawler) who wanted to play some Swedish style Death Metal influenced by bands from the early 90's. He contacted Lasse (Hooded Menace/Vacant Coffin/Claws) to lay down some drum tracks for the band. After completing the first song, it was decided this would be more than just a "project" and more of a serious band.

Elektrokutioner is handling the song writing and guitars/bass, while Lasse is doing the percussion as well as the solos/leads. The vocals are done by both members throughout the songs as well.
