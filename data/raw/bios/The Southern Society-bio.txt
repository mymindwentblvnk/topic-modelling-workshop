The Southern Society is a heavy/southern metal band from Subotica, Serbia. It's the brainchild of singer/guitarist/songwriter Tibor Szloboda, and guitarist/songwriter Endre Tolnai. They started the band in June of 2008, after a few years of plannig. In the summer of 2008 both of them were on hiatus from their previous bands: Amok (Tibor) and Nowhere-Drive (Endre), so they decided to start the long awaited project. Even before they started searching for the other 2 members, they began writing their own material for their upcoming debut album. In October of 2008 Endre recommended drummer Marcell Roncsak, also from Nowhere-Drive to join the band. In February 2009 they recruited Sandor Dorogi, a local musician to join the band as their bass player, and completing the official line-up. In 2012, Attila Nemet (Amentes, ex-Amok,ex-Raze) became the new permanent drummer for The Southern Society. 

The 4 members had very different musical backgrounds, but they also had a lot in common, so this helped in the development of their own sound. It could be best described as a mixture of heavy metal and southern metal/rock with some progressive elements.
