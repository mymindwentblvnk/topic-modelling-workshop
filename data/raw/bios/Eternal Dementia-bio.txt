Eternal Dementia was started in Norway by Stig A. Kristiansen and Tor Erik Simensen (ex-Ragnarok) in 2002. But things began to happen a few years earlier, back in 2000 when Stig recorded the song "The Terror Lies Hidden". One night during a session of alcohol consumption with some friends Stig put on the song and immediately caught the attention of those present. The response was so good that Stig began to work hard to form a band.

In January 2004 the band entered the studio to record their first effort entitled "The Virgin Sedated and Seduced". The demo was mixed and mastered by Tony Waade at Mistral Lydstudio and printed to 200 copies. Two songs were recorded for this release, as well as an intro track to "Set Out to Die". The music in the demo can be described as a blend of howling vocals, crushing guitars and thunderous drums contrasted by mellow synth passages.

Eternal Dementia play neither black nor death, just authentic metal. Their musical style is highly original as they believe that music should be about expressing oneself. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Eternal+Dementia">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
