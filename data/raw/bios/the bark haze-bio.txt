Bark Haze is a duo/trio of Thurston Moore, Gown(Andrew MacGregor) and Pete Nolan(if he is around). They have been called "the most rocking sit down guitar band ever" so now they stand up and try to be the most rocking stand up guitar band ever. They have destroyed audiences on the rainiest nights ever and kicked monitors off stages at community theatres. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Bark+Haze">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
