Minneapolis-based indie power-pop band Seymore Saves the World is made up of pianist and lead vocalist Scott Hefte (Superdanger), bassist Shawn Neary (Ex-Tapes 'N Tapes), and drummer Nate Perbix. The band writes about the position of outcast teenager and nerd. Pitchfork describes the band's sound as "borrow{ing} a great deal from similarly wry piano-based 1990s pop artists such as the New Radicals or Fastball. However, no influence more blatantly shows through these twelve songs than Ben Folds." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Seymore+Saves+the+World">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
