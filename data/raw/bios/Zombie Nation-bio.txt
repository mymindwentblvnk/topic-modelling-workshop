Zombie Nation is a German techno and electro project of the Munich based DJ and producer Florian Senfter (aka Splank!). Until 1999 Emanuel Guenther (aka Mooner) was also involved in the project.

The first Zombie Nation five track EP was released in the spring of 1999 on DJ Hell's label, International DeeJay Gigolo Records. The debut release contained the unsuspecting song Kernkraft 400, which was based on part of David Whittaker's music from the 1984 Commodore 64 game Lazy Jones. A licensed re-make of that song landed in high chart-positions all over the world.

Since 2001, Florian Senfter has released tracks on different labels under his new pseudonym John Starlight. In 2002 he did not renew his contract with Gigolo Records and decided to start his own label, Dekathlon Records. In early 2005, the new sublabel UKW Records was launched with John Starlight's "John's Addiction Part 1" followed by "Paeng Paeng" by Zombie Nation which was recorded a few months later. Sven Väth realized the potential of that song at first glance and licensed it for Cocoon Records.

“Working for the perfect moment” is how Splank! still describes his work with Zombie Nation. Get the best out of every single live moment and prove it again and again in every new situation. A risk-loving attitude and well-approved hardware equipment is what he needs to rearrange spontaneously and to directly react to the crowd. In the meantime, Zombie Nation live has become a brand and is among the most successful live acts in electronic music.

Since 2003, The track Kernkraft 400 has been a popular song at NHL, soccer, rugby and basketball games, used by numerous arenas as their goal-celebration song, and many more as a motivational beat. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Zombie+Nation">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
