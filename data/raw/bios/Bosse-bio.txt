There are two bands named Bosse; a rock band from Germany and an instrumental, minimalistic acoustic artist from the United States.

1. Bosse - a German rock band from Braunschweig (Brunswick).
Bosse got their name by their singer and former Hyperchild-member Axel Bosse. Further members of Bosse are Björn Krüger (drums), Thorsten Sala (guitar) und Theofilos Fotiades (bass).
In 2005 the band released their first single Kraft, produced by Wolfgang Stach. After that, they supported the German the crossover band Such A Surge on their farewell tour.
On 25th April 2005 Bosse released their first album Kamikazeherz on EMI, which achieved respectable success. In case of this they became support act of Mando Diao.

On 28th July 2006 the band released their second album Guten Morgen Spinner (again on EMI and Die Irritierten as the first single.

In 2007 the band took a break. Axel Bosse himself did several solo unplugged shows, supporting Emil Bulls on their acoustic tour as well as Kim Frank during the summer. Getting a lot of fun out of these unplugged appearances Bosse added a few festival solo shows (like Rheinkultur in Bonn).

The third album Taxi was released in the summer of 2009 on the label Fuego. The record was produced by Jochen Naaf (who worked with PeterLicht and Polarkreis 18) and Axel Bosse himself. Three singles were released so far: 3 Millionen, Liebe ist leise and Sommer lang (also referred to as Der Sommer ist noch lang).  The single "3 Millionen" was released in early 2009, and received much airplay. Axel Bosse was also a featured artist on Deutsche Welle's PopXport.

On September 29, 2011, Bosse came in third place in the annual Bundesvision Song Contest, out of 16 contestants, one from each of the German states. Bosse represented Lower Saxony, and sang "Frankfurt Oder", from their fourth album, Wartesaal (released February 25, 2011).

Bosse was nominated as Best Artist at the 1LIVE Krone 2011 awards. They came in second place, losing out to Clueso.

On March 8, 2013, the band released its fifth album, Kraniche, and confirmed a tour through Germany.[4]

Bosse made their second appearance on the annual Bundesvision Song Contest on September 27, 2013, this time coming in first place. They once again represented Lower Saxony, and sang "So Oder So", a single from Kraniche.

Bosse was nominated as Best Artist again at the 1LIVE Krone 2013 awards. They came in second place, losing out to Casper.

In 2017, Dutch rock band BLØF scored one of the biggest hits in Dutch history with "Zoutelande", their adaptation of Bosse's "Frankfurt Oder".
