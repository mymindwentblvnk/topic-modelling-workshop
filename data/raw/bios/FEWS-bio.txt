Fews (stylised as FEWS) are an American-English-Swedish rock band, formed in 2014 in Malmo, Sweden and are currently based in London, UK. Self described as post-punk, with motorik elements of krautrock and noise pop, the band blends this sound with elements of neo-psychedelia.

The band have released two album, Means in 2016 and Into Red in 2019.

FEWS specialise in propulsive, motorik noise-pop. Producer Dan Carey (Bat For Lashes / Sexwitch, Toy, Kate Tempest) found the band via Soundcloud &  invited the band to his studio. Epic 8 min debut  single ‘ILL’ quickly followed on Carey’s Speedy Wunderground label, described by The Times as a ‘meeting of NEU! and the Jesus & Mary Chain. Dark, brooding follow-up ‘ The Zoo’ was described by Stereogum as piece of ‘malevolent post-punk that bears additional semblance to DIIV and Faust’ .

Hot on the heels of the 6Music playlist for ‘The Zoo’, the band completed a sell-out tour with Spring King further enhancing their reputation as an exhilarating live experience. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/FEWS">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
