There are three bands:

1) Fire Garden is one of the most artistic, creative and aspiring bands. A project founded by Zeeshan Baig a.k.a. Zee in Chicago. Since then the band has released one EP ‘The Prelude’ (2012) and a full length studio record ‘Sound of Majestic Colors’ (2014).
 
Fire Garden’s philosophy is not to classify their music to one particular genre but to explore different styles to find their own sound. The band incorporates classic sounds, odd time signatures, skull crushing riffs, catchy vocal melodies, guitar and keyboard solos into their music without compromising the soul of music.
 
Breaching all the rules of traditional songwriting Fire Garden is continue to explore its journey into modern progressive music with all the classic sounds of its origins.
