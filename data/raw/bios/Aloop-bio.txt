Aloop is a band unwilling to compromise when it comes to the creation of their music. In developing their explosive and pulverizing sound, Aloop creates music charged with pure energy and raw emotion. Including elements from death-, heavy- and classical metal, Aloop combines the heaviness of e.g. early Sepultura with ass kicking southern thrash elements similar to those of Pantera and Slayer. The sound of Aloop has been labelled as a redefinition of old-school head-banging metal. Even though the quintet's sound is highly inspired by old-school metal, Aloop has managed to create a unique sound charged with melody and mind-shaking brutality hitting the listener hard in the face.
