the Knell plays slow metal, in general an amalgalm of doom metal styles. Founded in 1998, the band released only a handfull of tracks, due to rather unstable line-up. Disbanded in 2003 for about a year.

The debut full-length album was released on January 12, 2007 by TotalRust Music. Current lineup is working on material for the second full length, to be recorded in the summer/autumn of 2008. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Knell">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
