Sarah Shannon, lead singer of '90s indie-rock darlings Velocity Girl, releases her second solo album, "City Morning Song," further marking her departure from the guitar driven noise pop of her former band.

On "City Morning Song," Shannon composed all 12 tracks herself with help from piano player Matt Perry on six.  Within the frame of Martin Feveyear's earthy, analog, and apropos production (he has also worked with Mark Lanegan, Rosie Thomas, Brandi Carlyle, Village Green, and John Wesley Harding), "City Morning Song" offers up track after track of timeless classic pop with the central feature of Shannon's solo work -- her voice -- showing strong as ever.

With Feveyear at the helm, Casey Foubert on drums, Yuuki Matthews on bass, Sonny Votolato on guitar, and Matt Perry on piano, the stars were aligned to bring forth a collection of lush, satisfying love songs.  "I'm so happy with this record!" says Shannon, "not only because I love the way it sounds, but because it was a joy to make. Making my first record was such an arduous, protracted process. Of course there is always hard work involved in making a record, but working on this was fun ...thank God! I needed making music to be fun again."

So there you have it. Love songs. Making music for the shear joy of doing it. Go ahead and submit to the guilty pleasure of a good pop song sung with a pretty voice. Sarah Shannon's "City Morning Song" gives you permission to do just that. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sarah+Shannon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
