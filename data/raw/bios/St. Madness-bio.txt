St. Madness are a thrash metal band from Scottsdale, Arizona.

They are well known for their theatrical live shows with "guest appearances" by the likes of: Satan, Saint Madness, Carl the Clown, and Evil Elvis.

In October 2005, the group's lead vocalist, Prophet was diagnosed with cancer. This is the official press release that was issued:

"I have been diagnosed with the same cancer as Lance Armstrong and Tom Green. Though this is a very difficult time for me, my family and St. Madness, together we are all standing tall. I must have one of my testicles removed and I have cancer in my lymph nodes in my back. This Sunday, October 23rd, a writer from The Phoenix (Arizona) New Times magazine is coming to my house to interview me. After the interview, I am going to shave my head for their cameras, and then I am going to give my hair to Locks of Love' for children who need hair for wigs.

This is a disease that anyone can get at anytime. I don't feel that God is punishing me or anything like that. We all have sufferings to deal with in this life and it's just my turn. I plan to beat this and to be stronger than ever!!!

Peace,

Prophet/St. Madness"
