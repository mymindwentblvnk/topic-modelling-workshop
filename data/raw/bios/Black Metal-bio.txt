Dutch old school black metal in the vein of Sarc√≥fago and Beherit, hailing from Zaanstad, North Holland. Formed in 1990 but split up soon after their only demo "Pentagram" was released in 1991 by the Greek record label Black Power. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Black+Metal">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
