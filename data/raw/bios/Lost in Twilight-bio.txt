Lost in Twilight was formed in 1994 by drummer Janne Hänninen, keyboardist Jarno Hänninen and guitarist Jarno Laakso. In 1997 Sami Inkiläinen joined the band as a second guitarist and in July 1998 they recorded their first, self-financed album "Descending Mist," which was entirely instrumental.

In April 1999 Jii Adore joined the band as a vocalist. The first demo with vocals, "Forever Autumn," was released in October 1999 and it topped the Metal charts at mp3.com.

When Lost in Twilight signed with Hammerheart Records in 2002 they changed their name to Divercia and have since released several albums.
