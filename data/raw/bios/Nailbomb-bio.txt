Nailbomb was an industrial thrash metal  band that formed in 1994 as a side project by Brazilian musician Max Cavalera of Sepultura and Soulfly and English musician Alex Newport of Fudge Tunnel. Based in Phoenix, Arizona, they recorded a studio album, titled Point Blank, which was released through Roadrunner Records. They also played only a single live performance before disbanding.

Nailbomb hosted other musicians to play guest spots, including D.H. Peligro (Dead Kennedys), Max Cavalera's brother Igor Cavalera (Sepultura co-founder), and Mexican guitarist Dino Cazares (co-founder and guitarist of Fear Factory, Brujeria and Divine Heresy).

Nailbomb's second album, Proud to Commit Commercial Suicide, was a live recording capturing the band's appearance at the 1995 Dynamo Open Air Festival in Eindhoven, Netherlands. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nailbomb">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
