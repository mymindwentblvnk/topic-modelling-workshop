Sunset Steel is the awe-inspiring name of a one man-heavy metal/surf rock army from Deutschland, CA. Their songs tell tales of love, tenderness, crime fighting and other BIG AMERICAN STUFF. New songs are added frequently to the current collection of top notch smash hits in which the spirits of eighties rock music and Miami Vice-like beach stories clash with maximum power. The sound to surf your soul! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sunset+Steel">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
