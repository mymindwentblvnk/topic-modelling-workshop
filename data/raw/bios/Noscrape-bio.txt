"This is some seriously heavy, lethargic stoned out sludge!!! Good grief! Listening to this will give you a dense trip even if you go nowhere NEAR drugs..."

Band's core estabilished in 2001 by Dario and Dag, in a little place in the Bergamo's countryside, northern Italy.
Started as a punk-rock cover band, in 2004 they reach the first definitive lineup which includes: Dario (voice/guitar), Dag (guitar), Zana (bass) and Tina (drum).
After a lot of (shitty) never released recordings, in 2006 the band selfproduces its first demo called Ludovico Techinque. In 2007, the band gets into more stoner-oriented sounds and selfproduces its second demo called Stoned.

In 2008 Tina leaves the band so the lineup changes again: Zana moves to the drums, Dag to the bass while Tirlù (guitar) and Pero (synth & keyboards) join the band which, after some months, records its third self-titled demo.

In middle 2010 Pero leaves the band which however in January starts recording with Suffering Studio (ambient musician Adamennon's recording studio) its first EP called “Soundtrack to a post-atomic landscape” (Victory By Fire, Acufene, GroundGrinder, PerettaCoreZine); the EP has been released on August 2011.
