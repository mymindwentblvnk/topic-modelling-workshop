Wellington , New Zealand 2004 the band SEKHT was born.

Started by guitarist & founding member J.HELLKATZE.

Sick of the current metal trend in New Zealand and the world in general And Love Of Heavy Metal Started a mission to produce a sound that took all the bits & pieces of all the good types of Heavy Metal and roll em into one.

To Give The World "HELLCORE" metal.

"From the Heart/Core At The end Of The Day We Play
what ever the HELL we like Metal Wise"

The Term Was Coined Whilst The Band Was developing
a Following & Their Sound In CHRISTCHURCH New Zealand
Were They Have Been Based Since 2007

Influnced by the old guard of metal like - Black Sabbath
Pantera,early Slayer & Metallica , White zombie to name a few,
through to european black & deathmetal ,thrash,hardcore,speed,power,tech,industrial,goth,doom etc.
Pretty much any decent metal band that made an impact on the band members lives.

So thus far the band has
What seems to be a reliable & hungry line-up!!! a four piece to be reckoned with live!!
