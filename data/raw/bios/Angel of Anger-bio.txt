ANGEL OF ANGER were born in November 2003 from an idea of Andred (vocals) for “giving life” to her lyrics.  

Andred, with the help of Lord Axl Mato (Voice/Guitar of Winged) decides to search for new members interested in a brand new project.  Spezz (Bass-Player - founder of Basic Dream, Relic) quickly decides to join the band.  In May 2004 Angel of Anger completed their band with Animal as Drummer.  

And so everything begins… During 2004 the band is searching for their own musical identity, composing different songs. In November of the same year, Denis joins the band as solo guitarist.  On 10 December 2005 Angel of Anger take part at the “Blasphemous Storm Festival” at Screambloodygore (BO).  In January 2006, due to different musical affinities, Denis leaves the band; His role is immediately taken by Los.  Angel of Anger present the new member on 02 July 2006 with a live concert at “Ceremony Black Fest” in Lowenhof Pub (BO).  In 2007 Angel of Anger record their first cd titled: “ANGEL OF ANGER” care of “Lo Studio Dell’Arcano” (Bologna). After recording, Animal decides to leave the band, replaced in October by Grodnah. Currently, Angel of Anger are engaged in live exhibitions for promoting the album.

After some live experiences Angel of Anger are still collecting successes, due to a strong sonority and presence. The band’s sound is not definable, built up with a Gothic base but Influenced by the most extreme of musical genres such as Death Metal and Black Metal.  The vocals are melodic yet comprised also of screams and growls, interpreted in a natural and expressive way.  Their lyrics are full of arcane thematics.   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Angel+Of+Anger">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
