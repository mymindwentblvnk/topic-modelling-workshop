Mindpatrol was founded in summer 2012 by Luc Francois and Xavier Hofmann as a studio project. As the writing sessions of the album were much more intense and productive than expected, it soon became obvious that the initial studio project should become a real band.

With the goal of telling a story on each one of their future releases, Mindpatrol don't care about genre limitations and play whatever music fits best to the mood of their concepts.

On their first album „Downfall Theatre“, you can find a huge variety of different musical styles reaching from a ballad and melodic power metal to nasty thrash and fast-paced black metal. Expect a fresh new way of making metal! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mindpatrol">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
