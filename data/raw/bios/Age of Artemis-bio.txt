Age Of Artemis is from Brasilia, Brazil’s capital. It was formed by Pedro Senna’s idea (drummer). To complete the lineup, the band has these well known musicians: Alirio Netto (Vocals), Nathan Grego (Guitars), Gabriel “T-Bone” Soto (Guitars) and Giovanni Sena (Bass).

A producer was asked to combine their musicality, technique and taste. To be part of this endeavor Edu Falaschi (Angra / Almah) takes place to give a direction and identity to the album. The detailed process of production and recording resulted in the explosive album “Overcoming Limits”. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Age+of+Artemis">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
