PAUW (Dutch word for Peacock) is a psychedelic rock band from The Netherlands, formed in 2012. Three friends from Twente, The Netherlands, with a huge passion for the psychedelic music of the 60s and 70s decide to jam together. 
Rens Ottink on drums, Eszl du Vois on bass and organ and Brian Pots on guitar and vocals were immediately a hit after the first time playing together, meaning the birth of PAUW. The boys then spent weeks in an old pig barn to prepare for their magical prospective set. 

In 2014, they recorded a few demos in the same barn, and reported these to the “Popronde”. Subsequently, they were booked for a whopping 38 shows, making them the most booked band in the history of the Dutch festival. In the meantime, they provided support for Temples, Elephant Stone and performed an aftershow for Kasabian. They made their debut on radio and TV, with performances at 3FM, 3voor12 radio and De Wereld Draait Door, a popular talk show. The Netherlands came to learn about PAUW in a short time. 

In 2015, they continued as a four-man band. Eszl du Vois returns after a period of absence as bassist, and multi-instrumentalist Kees Braam, having been fixed roadie from the very beginning, joins the band as keyboardist. 

With a runaway beaten drummer, a bombastic bass, an enchanting keyboardist and a charismatic guitarist with dreamy vocals, PAUW will take you on a magnificent and unforgettable trip.
