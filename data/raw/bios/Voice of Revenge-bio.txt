Voice of Revenge was founded in 2005 by Peter Kretschmer and Thomas Döll in the german based town Würzburg. The aim of our music is to create songs which are interesting and showing a margin of diversity in combination with bewaring the exigency of Brutality and Feeling of Death Metal. Their Trademarks are the combination of Songstructures which are very remarkable and incisive and melodies which backgrounded in different kinds of Death Metal. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Voice+of+Revenge">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
