Pripegal is a project inspired by pre-christian
Slavia and modern neopagan conceptions,
particularly Jan Stachniuk's and Zadruga's.
Musically, the greatest inspiration for Pripegal
is Bathory. Copying Master isn't the aim though,
for the sounds of Pripegal differ much from those
that can be found on Quorthon's albums. The
concept of Pripegal is based on bringing the
atmosphere of past ages as well as the creator's
personal emotions in a modern form. First ideas
and tracks emerged in 1995, however the
possibility of their realisation didn't appear
until 4 years later. That's how "Slavia Antiqua"
came into existence, subsequently released in 2004
by Hammerbolt Rec., limited to 300 copies.
In the meantime tracks were created for the second
album, "Ziemia Gromadzi Prochy" ("Earth Gathers
the Ashes"), has been recorded in Winter, 836
years, after collapse of the last, greatest Slavic
temple. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pripegal">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
