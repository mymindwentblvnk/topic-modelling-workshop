Nuclear Omnicide is a crossover band based in Helsinki, Finland. Starting out as a more straightforward thrash metal outfit in 2010, the band continued soaking up influences and honing their sound until eventually evolving into a heavy, fast, aggressive and intense group with a distinct signature style. Swearing by their motto of always giving a 110% and always destroying, Nuclear Omnicide has gained a reputation of being a crushing live act. Now with a newly cemented kick-ass line-up and a bunch of amazing gigs under their belt, including most of the biggest metal festivals in Finland: Tuska Festival, Jalometalli, Nummirock and a Sepultura support gig, the boys are looking to continue wreaking havoc in and around Finland and Europe in 2017 and beyond. So far the band has released 2 EPs and 2 full-length albums.
