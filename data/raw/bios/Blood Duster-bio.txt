Blood Duster are a five piece grind/death/stoner rock band from Melbourne, Australia formed in 1991, they are known for their fast and heavy musical style. The band are currently enjoying some semi-mainstream success after their self-titled Blood Duster album and an appearance at the annual Big Day Out festival.

The band's first offering, Yeest, was a straightforward grindcore album. The follow up album, Str8 Outta Northcote was a southern-flavored stoner rock album. The band's third album, Cunt was a more intense and true-to-its-roots offering, with rhythmic bluesy metal guitars and heavy drumwork.

Blood Duster toured across Europe and Japan in mid 2005 to promote the release of their first DVD, tentatively titled "The Shape of Death to Come" as well as a re-release of their first EP, "Fisting the Dead".
