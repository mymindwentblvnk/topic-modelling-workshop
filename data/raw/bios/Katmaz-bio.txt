Katmaz is a Brooklyn based songwriter, producer, and multi-instrumentalist that approaches music visually, resulting in a cinematic quality to his sound.  Born in Buffalo, NY, Katmaz found his passion for music at a very young age.  After moving around the midwest and touring with the alternative act, Debussi,  Katmaz settled in New York City in 2014.  With the help of fellow producers Braden Blair, Savings, Matt Cody (SZA, Ro James) and artist Dylan Jones, Katmaz created WaveCave studios.

In April of 2016, Katmaz gave a sample of his emotive, soulful strain of music with his first solo release "Nautical Things".  Jason Grishkoff (Indie Shuffle) called it "beautiful enough to put me into a stupor" and placed it in their "Best Folk of 2016." Currently, he is focused on recording his next EP which mixes electronic and analog elements to develop a new, unique sound. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Katmaz">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
