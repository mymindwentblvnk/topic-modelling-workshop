ALITOR is a Thrash Metal band from Indjija, Serbia, founded on July 11th 2011 by Marko (bass guitar/vocals) and Stefan (drums) along with Aleksandar (guitars) and Jovan (guitars). Their intention was simple: to play Old School Bay Area Thrash Metal (in honor of Forbidden, Exodus, Vio-Lence, Heathen, Testament, Death). Their first gig, marking their official start as a band, was a local "battle of the bands", where they took second place after only one month of practicing. 

In December 2012 ALITOR released their first demo, an EP entitled “Embittered”. This demo was recorded in Citadela Sound Productions Studio in Belgrade during the months of September/October 2012. It was produced by Luka Tower Matkovic from SPACE EATER. “Embittered” garnered great reviews from around the world, ultimately encouraging the band to start work on their debut full length. Once again the band entered the Citadela Sound Productions Studio in October 2013 to start recording their debut album entitled “Eternal Depression”. The album was released in September 2014 by German label WITCHES BREW!
In November Alitor, together with Space Eater, is going on their "Passing through the fire to Europe" tour.


“Alitor strives towards somewhat different structure from that usual for thrash metal, thus their performance, primarily in terms of guitar, melody and structure, relies on legacy of bands Atheist and Death, while solid basis comes from the 80s Bay Area thrash metal scene.”
-Nocturne Magazine, December 2013.
