Formed in 1997 in Potomac, Maryland Spirit Caravan is a doom/stoner metal band featuring the legendary guitarist and vocalist Scott Weinrich (aka: Wino) formerly of The Obsessed and Saint Vitus. The band had a lyrical emphasis on spirituality (though not necessarily religion) and global politics.

Other band members were Dave Sherman (bass and vocals) and Gary Isom (drums). Weinrich credits them for encouraging him to join the band and become active musically again, after he had abandoned his music career.

Thought the band has officially split, it is believed the band split-up a short time after their tour in 2002.

After the band's demise, Weinrich joined Place of Skulls, founded a new band, The Hidden Hand, and contributed vocals and guitars to Dave Grohl's project Probot. Sherman went on to join long-time stoner drummer Eric Little to form the band Earthride.

Their song "Dove-Tongued Aggressor" was featured on the Tony Hawk's American Wasteland soundtrack. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Spirit+Caravan">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
