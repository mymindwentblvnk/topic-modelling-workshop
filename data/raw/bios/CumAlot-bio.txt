2006
CumAlot was formed at the summer of 2006 by George(guitars) and Thanasis(vocals)
(Morpheus). In a short period of searchirg they found and added in the first 
line-up of the band, Aris(drums)(x-Abiogenesis), Thodoros(guitar) and Kosmas
(bass and backing vocals)(Infravision,x-Bios).Before the first live performance
Thodoros didn't continue with the band for personal reasons.With that line-up 
the band took part at few live performances and had a view to start recording 
their first demo.

                                 2007
In the beginning of the first recordings, due personla reasons the band separated and went
in a long period of inactivity.The recordings tapes were never released.

                                 2008
After a long time passed all members made their own projects utill one day George
and Aris decided to start the band from scratch.The other members couldn't
continue with the band, so they had to find new members.

                                 2009
The result of a long researching for a new line-up brings Chris(vocals)(x-Mossbakk,x-Fly on a carion)
at the role of singing, Nikos(bass)(TUPA) as a bass player and Stefanos(guitar)
(x-Erratic Escape) on guitar.Then the band entered the studio to record their
first single "Nobody Can" which was filmed as a videoclip to improve the return of
the band. Meanwhile CumAlot is preparing tnew material in order to record the first full length
album which will propably released at the near future. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/CumAlot">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
