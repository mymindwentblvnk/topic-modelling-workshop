In 1997, Morgana Lefay split apart. Persson, Heder and Soderling relocated to Stockholm, leaving Rytkönen and Eriksson to find new members. Contractual disputes with Black Mark ended with Rytkönen and Eriksson (along with new members from Fantasmagoria) having to change name to simply Lefay. Persson, Heder and Soderling recorded an album under the Morgana Lefay name, but only to get rid of contractual obligations. The album is not recognised by the current incarnation of the band.

In September of 2004 Lefay resigned with Black Mark and regained the rights to use their full name. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lefay">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
