A Projection is a gothic rock band from Stockholm, Sweden. With dark textures of effect-driven guitars, lush synthesizers, and heartfelt, introspective lyrics, their music has frequently been compared to that of Interpol, New Order, The Cure, and The Chameleons.

Formed in 2013, the band quickly became an underground sensation, owing much of their success to their powerful and atmospheric live performances. By combining a dense, sinister sound with suggestive video projections, the band quickly established themselves as a highly sought-after live act. Following the release of their eponymous demo EP, the band was contacted by several record companies, eventually signing with the Hamburg-based label Tapete Records.

The lead singer Isak Erikson left after the completion of the second album "Framework" and was replaced by Rikard Tengvall, previously active as the bass player of the band.
The band switched to Metropolis Records for their third album "Section" <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/A+Projection">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
