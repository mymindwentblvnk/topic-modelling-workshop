Little Annie, also known as Annie Anxiety Bandez (also 'Little Annie Anxiety Bandez') is a singer, painter, and stage actor, perhaps most widely known for her vampish performance of the song 'Things Happen', with the band Coil. She has recorded extensively with vanguard figures of late twentieth century music such as rock musician Kid Congo Powers, dub stalwart Adrian Sherwood, punk/experimental band Crass, and experimental/electronica band Coil, an entity that had its origins in the first Industrial band, Throbbing Gristle. 

Little Annie currently performs in New York City, and has released solo albums since the 1980s.  Her most recent album, 'Songs from the Coalmine Canary' is co-produced by Antony Hegarty, and Joe Budenholzer, of Backworld.
