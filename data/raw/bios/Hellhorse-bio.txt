Hellhorse is a full blown assault of arcane misanthropy bordering on the divine. Hailing from the grim and frostbitten kingdom of Tucson, Arizona, Hellhorse is devoted to the expansion and preservation of the sacred art forms of Ouija and Rune Magicke. Channeling talents gleaned from the holy gifts of the Chaos Gods and fusing them with an intellectual capacity far exceeding that of any mortal with terrestrial origins, Hellhorse looks forward to its releases with Twelve Gauge Records.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hellhorse">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
