Echobelly are a British/Swedish indie band. They were brought to prominence after much praise by singer Morrissey who asked them to be the opening act on his 1994 tour. 

The two main members are vocalist Sonya Aurora Madan and guitarist Glenn Johansson. They briefly peaked during the Britpop craze of the mid-1990s with 2 UK Top 10 albums, 1994's everyone's got one and 1995's on.

Other albums include 1997's lustra, 2001's people are expensive and 2004's gravity pulls. A best-of compilation was released in 2002 called i can't imagine the world without me.

In 2008 a new best-of (simply entitled The Best Of Echobelly) has been released by SonyBMG while the band is working on new material.
