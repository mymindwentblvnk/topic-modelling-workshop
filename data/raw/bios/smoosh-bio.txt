Smoosh were a three piece indie pop band, formed in Seattle, Washington in 2000.  The band comprised three sisters, Asya Saavedra (keyboard, vocals), Chloe Saavedra, (drums), and Maia Saavedra,  (bass) and recorded for Pattern 25 and Barsuk Records.

Smoosh gained early recognition through their connection with Death Cab for Cutie drummer Jason McGerr, who instructed Chloe at the Seattle Drum School, and the support of well-known indie acts Cat Power and Sleater-Kinney.

The group released three albums (She Like Electric, Free To Stay, Withershins) and toured internationally with Eels, Bloc Party, and The Dresden Dolls before disbanding in 2012.  On June 12 of that year, the group announced via Facebook that Asya and Chloe would continue recording under the name Chaos Chaos. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Smoosh">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
