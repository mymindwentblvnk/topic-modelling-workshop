1) Disbanded Japanese heavy/speed metal band that played in the 80s, their music is heavily influenced by occultism.

2) Swedish death metal band. Formed by the "original" (i.e., pre-Akerfeldt, and thus pre-recording) members of Opeth. Mikael Akerfeldt had been recruited by David Isberg as a bassist without the knowledge or consent of the remainder of the band, despite the fact that he would be replacing or supplementing their current bass player. The end result was that Opeth in its entirety (aside from Isberg and Akerfeldt) quit and formed Crowley.
