Nostra Morte is a symphonic gothic metal band from Mexico and this is their debut CD, the title of which may be translated as “A tale before dying”. As you would expect from a symphonic gothic metal band, their songs are generally extremely epic with pervasive warm keys and strings, and backing choir. They are driven by the guitars and drums, however, both of which are quite hard and aggressive, offering a striking contrast to the symphonic/choral warmth. The songs are generally mid-paced with a nice subtle changing tapestry of riffs, along with and occasional galloping blackened power metal runs and heavy acoustic symphonic interludes. There is a noticeable transition to more festive, even playful, melodies and riffs in the last few songs on the CD.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nostra+Morte">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
