There are two known bands with the name Warden:

1 - Warden's first steps into realms of obscurity were made with the release of “Visions Of The Shadow Kingdom". They ventured into dark ambient/synth with the subsequent "Rites of Passage". After a live ritual in May 2016 Warden incorporated live instruments and a more ritualistic approach on "The Obsidian Realm". Warden's form reflects discoveries made in unknown realms and vast inner landscapes.

2 - Warden is a metal band from Osijek, Croatia, formed in 2008 by Tihomir Mor, Zvonimir Mor and Ivan Periškić. At that time Tomislav Mor was playing with Pandemonium, but when they fell apart he joined Warden. They were playing covers of their favorite bands, but still needed a vocalist. At the beginning of 2009, Ivan Vampatić agreed to join the band. Now the lineup was complete.

Main influences on their music and style were bands such as Pantera, Amon Amarth, Dethklok, Carcass and Kreator. They were practising by covering songs and slowly began to discover their style. At the end of 2009 Tomislav Mor wrote their first song called Demonation. They stayed a garage band until 2011, when they made their first appearance on stage in Slatina.

They are currently recording their first demo album, planed to be released in 2012. They are also looking for gigs at the moment.
