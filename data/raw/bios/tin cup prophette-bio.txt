Getting her name from the tip cup dangling from her fiddle case, Amanda Kapousouz (a.k.a. the Tin Cup Prophette) is no stranger to the stage. From New York City, she entertained thousands of commuters daily on subway platforms for small change. Working her way above ground, Kapousouz began to play with various bands in the city, ranging in style from traditional Irish to heavy metal, bluegrass to jazz, dixieland to rock 'n' roll. She has also composed music for modern dance, arranged music for film, and has toured extensively on the Irish music circuit.   

"Gaining experience from playing with so many different bands and being exposed to different styles of fiddling have really helped me develop as a musician", she says. In addition to music, Kapousouz is an academic tutor to children in the entertainment industry with credits including School of Rock, The Emperor's Club, The Big Apple Circus, and The Sopranos.  "Teaching is NO 9-5 job, especially in the entertainment industry, and paired with a music career, well, there's really no time to sleep."  

City life took its toll, and Kapousouz decided to move to the music-friendly town of Athens, Georgia, to pursue music on her own. "It's been great backing people up in varying genres, but I think from all of that experience I really know what I'd like to do musically and I'm ready to be a frontwoman."  In August 2003, Kaousouz competed among over 130 bands and songwriters in Smith's Olde Var's open-mic-madness tournament, and managed to win first runner up.

Since then, the Tin Cup Prophette has been writing songs and performing scattered shows while searching for the right band. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tin+Cup+Prophette">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
