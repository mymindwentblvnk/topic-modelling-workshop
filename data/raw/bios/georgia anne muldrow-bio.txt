Since then she has had many different collaborative efforts both independent and mainstream that have flown under the radar like her duets with Erykah Badu, "Fly Away" on Sa-Ra' "Hollywood Recordings" album and "Master Teacher" on Erykah' last album, "New Amerykah Part One: 4th World War". More recently she produced and sang lead vocals for the song, “Roses” from Mos Def’ current album, “The Ecstatic”.

Georgia is also known well for an abstract production and writing style that breaks from normal song structure as can be seen on most of her previous releases. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Georgia+Anne+Muldrow">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
