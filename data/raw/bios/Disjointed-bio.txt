Disjointed is a Hip-Hop artist, and member of the Boomslang Crew (including Sin7ven, fo1006 and Mawthra).  He's the Audio engineer who mixes/masters all music for the group, and others outside of it when he does commissions.  A rapper and producer as well as being an all around great person, how he remains humble is truly a feat to be praised for. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Disjointed">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
