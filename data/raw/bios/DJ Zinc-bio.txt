DJ Zinc is a drum and bass disc jockey from the United Kingdom.

DJ Zinc is renowned for both his skills as a DJ and for the quality of his productions and remixes. He rose to prominence in the period of drum and bass production dominated by the hip-hop-influenced Jump-Up style, although he has continually positioned himself at the cutting edge of the music by embracing a variety of styles in his versatile DJ sets.

He also remains a relative rarity in the drum and bass scene in that his productions outside drum and bass, most notably in the breaks genre under the pseudonym Jammin, are highly popular. Several of his productions have been successful in the 2 step or UK Garage genres, and Zinc's work is also appreciated by Grime artists. Towards the end of the decade, Zinc's embrace of fidget house has seen him gain further popularity as he released the 'Crack House EP' and can be found playing non drum n bass sets on a fairly regular basis.

DJ Zinc produces and DJs as part of the Ganja Kru and True Playaz collectives, often in association with friend and mentor DJ Hype. He also runs the Bingo Beats record label, which releases both drum and bass and breaks records.
