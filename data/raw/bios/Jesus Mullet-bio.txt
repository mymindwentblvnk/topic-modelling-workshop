Originally formed in February 2001 by Jay Chapman and Mark McGee, Jesus Mullet's goal is to play straight up heavy rock 'n' roll. After acquiring bass player Andrew Rashotte in early 2002, the band has recorded several demos and most recently recorded the full-length "Waiting For The Next Wagon". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jesus+Mullet">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
