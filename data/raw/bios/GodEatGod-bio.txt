Godeatgod is a band from Illinois and plays sludge in the vein of Eyehategod and Crowbar. This is the letter they send to Metal Maniacs and was published in MM’s November 2000 issue. This is for me a kind of manifesto against all these "Vampyric/Gothic metal from Sweden with dark male vocals and beautiful female vocals, Featuring members of…" or "Fast brutal atmospheric black metal from Norway" that are polluting the metal scene these days…They say what many peoples think including me about these bands.


Dear Metal Maniacs,

We came up with 20 reasons our band, Godeatgod, can’t get a record deal or appear in Metal Maniacs : 
1) we don’t wear corpsepaint
2) we don’t own hubcap-sized pentagram necklace
3) we don’t pretend we worship Satan
4)don’t have anything with wings/horns/fire on our covers
5) no keyboards
6)no ugly goth woman doing spoken word passage
7) we’re not in 17 other side projects per members
8) we don’t wear bulletbelt, leather pants and spikes, 
9) we don’t dye our hair black, 
10) we don’t play anything "atmospheric", 
11) we’re not Swedish or Norwegian, 
12) our band photos weren’t taken in the woods, in a cemetery, or in the winter, 
13) you can read our logo, 
14) non of our songtitles begin with "Thy" or "Thine," 15) none of our past members have committed murders, burnt down churches, or ate human flesh, 
16)none of us are centuries-old vampires, 
17) you can actually hear our guitar riffs in our music, 
18) we’re not faster, more technical, more brutal, thrashier, more progressive, more operatic, more hateful, more Satanic, or darker than every other bands
19) we’re not pushing 40 and living with our parents
20) we don’t suck. 

We’ll try to remedy these problems before we complete our next cd. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Godeatgod">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
