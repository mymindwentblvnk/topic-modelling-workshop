Ethan (guitars) and Matt (vocals/drums) had been making music together for a few years in central Ohio, and they had been sitting on their weight in brutal death gold. After looking for the right guys to accompany their instrumental devastation, they felt that they had found the perfect guttural voice in Jon (vocals/drum programming) to join their ranks, with Angelo (bass) also coming into the the band in May, 2012.

Now that the group was finalized, they just needed a name. It came very quickly to Jon as he knew their shared love for the legendary goregrind outfit known as Last Days Of Humanity, and he suggested Indigestible Suppuration as an homage to their brutal sound. Naturally, everyone agreed that not only was it a powerful and vicious name, but it would truly represent the sound they wanted to bring to the table.

While I.S. is still in its infancy, the group is not looking to be confined by any limitations that may stand in their way. They collectively have been beating the odds and putting out music that they are not only proud of, but seemed to be garnering a good bit of attention as well.

This is only the beginning of the destruction that Indigestible Suppuration is capable of. Stay tuned at their official Facebook page for updates on their domestic auditory terrorism!
