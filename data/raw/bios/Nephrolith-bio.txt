The spiritual katharsis has begun in the anno MMVIII originally founded by Nerthag, Isvaroth and Skargart. Soon after, Navtyr and Tersagir completed the circle of etheral spirits. Their first revelation was brought to this dimension in the beginning of anno MMIX. They continued the path on which they spread their comprehension of soul's departure. In the meantime new shards of the great revelation have taken form in which they are trying to present a deeper meaning in death as well as life that is the host of all evil, breeded by humanity.

Nephrolith is a spiritual keeper between dimensions of the living and the departed. It is worshipping creation of illuminated darkness against putrefacted human existence. Essence within humanity itself has been covered by infinite ignorance and evil light â€“ Xullux.

An era of enlightment has come to purify the culprit. Obscure katharsis is on its way to deliver us from this eternal illusion and all that exists will be revealed by reflecting the blackened illumination. From the ashes of the decaying eden a renewed flame will be set ablaze and carried amongst the chosen.
