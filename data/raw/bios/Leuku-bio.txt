The four Leuku members started playing music together in the early 90's. The group provides their listeners with big sounding rock with interesting melodies and harmonies, and the band also wishes to broaden the musical horizon of their audience. Leuku sound is a unique blend of different genres of rock, with diversity from metal and alternative rock sounds to extreme psychedelia. The band utilizes tough-as-nail sounding guitars, mellow basslines and raw beating of drums in its music, all wrapped together with melodic and powerful singing and the storyline of everyday working class life, as well as universal oneness and soul search.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Leuku">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
