Dark Legend was formed by The Reaper in the autumn of 2004 in a dark room in bohus. 
The reaper made the records "Dark Demo" and Midnightwalk at the graveyard all
 by himself in his dark room. Dark Legend went underground after Midnightwalk in 2005, then again
in november 2005 Dark Legend had recruited The raper and they released the EP Motherfucking Darkness
which sold in 2 ex worldwide. The followup to MD was called Death without end released in march 2006 and sold in
 1 Ex worldwide and was mostly spread by the internet (just like motherfucking darkness)
autumn 2006 saw the release of damned fucking darkness and the recording of the record dark legend will kill you (released in 2007)
Since august 2007 dark legend has been writing material for their next coming full length : Fuck my ass bleeding.
And that's were dark legend are now.
