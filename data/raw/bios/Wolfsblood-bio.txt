There are multiple artists with this name:

1)Russian dark ambient/ritualistic music

Wolfsblood is the one-man project made by Russian neofolk web-zine Seidr creator, Wolfsblood. 
Some other people took part in Wolfsblood albums recording. 
They are the musicians of Moon Far Away, Waldsonne, Embrace Of Branches and Ritual Front. 
Vigdis Sol is the official vocalist of this project and its permanent member. She is a specialist in Scandinavian languages, lives in Tallinn, Estonia.
The second album ALU was made as a non-musical one specially. ALU, it's not a music, but the modern ritual, based on ancient Scandinavian tradition. 
There's also voice of Leonid Korablev ("Galdur" track), declaiming the ancient incantation from Icelandic Book of Magic Galdrab√≥k. Leonid Korablev is a leader Russian specialist in ancient Icelandic mythology and magic runic texts. He is the author of the number of books devoted to this themeas well the author of runic monogram ALU, represented on the album-cover.
Wolfsblood project has never made any live concerts and nowadays to make them seem rather impossible by number of objective reasons. 
The third album is being in the working process nowadays and most likely won't be the ALU continuation.
