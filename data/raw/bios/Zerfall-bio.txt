There are a few Bands from Germany called Zerfall.

One of them is from Essen in NRW. They play fine Black Metal, sometimes with acousticparts.

Another is a very small band from Itzehoe in Schleswig-Holstein. They do very simple anarchist, anti-capitalist punkrock/hardcore. As far as I know they split up right after playing their first concert in Glueckstadt and never released any of their songs, but somehow a few mp3s got rescued and are now only avaiable on some filesharing-networks. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Zerfall">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
