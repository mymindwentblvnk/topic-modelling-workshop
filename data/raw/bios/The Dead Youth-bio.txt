One of the earliest death metal bands from Chicago, IL, The Dead Youth were formed in 1988. Their line-up consisted of John Karnes (bassist), Joe Schaeffer (drummer), Rick Sprague (guitarist) and Dave Piekarz (vocalist), of whom the last three would form Usurper in 1993, leading The Dead Youth to split-up the same year.
