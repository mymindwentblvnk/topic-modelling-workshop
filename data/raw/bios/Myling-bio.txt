Black/Folk Metal

Myling is about invoking the dark Germanic spirit with the means of the youngest traditional Teutonic traces, namely the Scandinavian folklore. These remnants with primordial ties are keys to unlock pure doors to the secrets inherited in blood. With the direct link to the folk spirit by a traditional melody in each hymn and the use of real incantations taken directly from Swedish folk magic in the lyrics, the secrets of the blood are chanted and the primeval apparitions summoned.

Myling was formed in Västerås Sweden in 2007 by Orm - Vocals, Drums, Keyboards (Tyrant (Swe), Wod, Domgård, Ormgård) and Åskväder - Guitar, Bass (Hetroertzen).

It is Orm that runs Scythe of Death Productions which is a label that spreads anti-cosmic propaganda, with main focus on Dankwaþiudiskatruwōn (dark Germanic heathenism).
