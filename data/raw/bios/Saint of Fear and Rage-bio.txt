S.O.F.A.R. (Saint of fear and rage) is a group consisted of six people with different music styles, but combining those differences, we got something we have today ...uniqueness. Everything started in March 2005 with something that should've been a thrash metal project.. we called it Necrotomy, but soon, with the arrival of the new members..,the time was passing by and we created,what we have today, a black Symphonic gothic band called S.O.F.A.R. (Saint of fear and rage). Like in every other band, in the previous 5 years we dealed with the problem called change of members, however, we would like to thank every musician that has ever played with us and gave his contribution to the band. So far :) we have published one demo album called At Hell Gates in 2006 and one album, our very first one, called Behind the falling star in 2009.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Saint+Of+Fear+And+Rage">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
