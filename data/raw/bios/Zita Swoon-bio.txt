Zita Swoon entered the music scene of Antwerp, Belgium back in 1993 under the name A Beatband with the EP Jintro Travels The Word In A Skirt. The group is typical of the musicscene in Antwerp, with members playing in numerous other groups. Its best known member is Stef Kamil Carlens (who at the time was still dEUS' bassplayer as well), but the initial group also included Aarich Jespers.

The same group released Everyday I Wear A Greasy Black Feather On My Hat in '95 under the name Moondog Jr., and shortly thereafter were legally forced to change their name again.  They settled on Zita Swoon, which means 'intense desire'. The success of the album resulted in invitations to the Lowlands, Pinkpop and Torhout festivals. They also appeared live on MTV that year in Most Wanted with Michael Blair.

Their first appearance in the US was at the South by Southwest festival in '98. Zita Swoon has played at numerous locations, from New York to the Belgian Rock Werchter festival, the Holland Festival and also in Germany. They have been awarded the title Cultural Ambassador of Flanders in '99 (after DAAU and dEUS) and their work has been supported by the government with 1.5 million Francs.
