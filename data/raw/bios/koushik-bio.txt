Koushik is a Canadian electronic musician from Dundas, Ontario.

Koushik is signed to Stones Throw Records and has released Be With (2005), a collection of singles and EPs from 2002-2005; and Out My Window (September 30th 2008). He has worked with Four Tet, Caribou (aka Manitoba) and Madvillain.

The son of Indian immigrants, Koushik attended classical Indian singing classes with his mother as a child. His interest in other genres, more specifically hip-hop, also came at a young age while visiting record shops during trips to the farmers market in Hamilton, Ontario

Koushik specializes in making that hazy, hip-hop-based downbeat sh*t that you could easily compare to contemporaries such as Four Tet (who released Koushik's first single on his Text label), RJD2, and DJ Shadow. What sets Koushik apart from the others is a beautiful '60s psych-pop element that tends to pervade throughout. It shows itself in the spacious panned strings, acoustic guitars, and harpsichords that fall in and out of each other; and the beats have a harder regimented classic true school hip-hop sound, that Four Tet and Prefuse 73 tend to stray away from. But what I truly love about this record is Koushik's voice. His singing is soft and mixed way down in the center of the track, sounding like the voice choirs you'd hear on one of those old Percy Faith or 101 Guitars from the late-'60s. But more importantly, causes the listener to focus more on the music than the lyrical content. If you're a fan of any of the aforementioned artists, you need this record. â€“ OTHER MUSIC, NYC <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Koushik">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
