The Element is a California/USA based Progressive Rock/Metal act.

 The Element is composed of musicians who use their knowledge as a tool to carve technique, feeling, and heaviness into their music.  

 The band began with their debut concert in Brazil, opening for Blind Guardian in 2002.  After they received such good reception in Brazil from their first album, “Mind Sludge,” they decided to move their efforts to America in order to expand to an already fast-growing fan-base there.  
After Rafael Macedo joined forces with Mitch Stewart (Circle II Circle), Henry Moreno (Imagika, Taunted), and Jeremy Villucci, the band had found it’s perfect lineup.  With their new lineup complete, the band is releasing its new album titled "From Sand - Part I" in January 11th, 2012. The album was mixed and mastered by legendary producer, Beau Hill (Ratt, Warrant, Alice Cooper, Europe, Gary Moore, Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton, Winger).
