The Dying died on 29 july 2010. Their statement on facebook: "Ten years we gave everything in our power, but now we feel that we have achieved everything we could achieve with The Dying. We recorded albums, played fullhouses at Graspop and Pukkelpop, did support for Exodus, Arch Enemy,... and opened for Slayer at the Lotto Arena. We toured from Tallinn To Bilbao... with minivans ...and nightliners! On the road we met a lot of cool and crazy people! It was one hell of a blast!"
