The birth of Cpt. Kronos

Antero had been writing and recording song ideas at home. He wanted to have drums for one song an asked for Matti to make the demo drums in early 2012. Antero's influences were old horror movies and doom bands. Since Antero thought the material was good enough, he decided to form a proper band. The band started in summer 2012 when all the current members were found. This is how Cpt. Kronos' story began.

There were two songs ready and two more were written and rehearsed during the summer 2012. The Invocation EP was recorded at Cpt. Kronos' rehearsal room during november and december and mixed soon after.
