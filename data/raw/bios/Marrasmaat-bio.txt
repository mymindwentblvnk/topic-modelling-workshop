Obscure Finnish Black Metal from the Southern part of the country. They create Black Metal with a strange but recognizable atmosphere. Taking inspiration from the everlasting cycle of Life and Death, Marrasmaat studies the presence of the Mist thatâ€™s always lurking in the corner of our eyes, escaping our view, until the time has come to be succumbed by the cold Breath. 
They have released one self-titled EP so far containing two tracks.
