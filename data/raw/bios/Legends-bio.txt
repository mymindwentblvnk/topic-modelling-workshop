Legends was a project in the late 90ies consisting of Eric Clapton (guitar), Marcus Miller (bass), David Sanborn (sax), Joe Sample (piano) and Steve Gadd (drums). They performed a couple of concerts including the opening concert of the 31st Montreux Jazz Festival (Switzerland, 04. July 1997). This concert was recorded, but never officially released. However this take has appeared in the bootleg scene as a double-CD under the title of "Gods Meeting".
