3) MAR is a band from Columbia, Missouri playing a mix of noisy rock and sludge. It's loud and there's a lot of odd time signatures and grooves and so forth. Imagine if the Jesus Lizard wrote their songs with a calculator. Named after the sound a guy makes at the gym when he lifts.

4) mar is a metal band from Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK. Mar is a post-metal band in the most general sense. There's lots of influences here ranging from hardcore to black metal to doom and some ambient. They are currently in the midst of working on an album to be released later this year [2015] and were featured on the most recent Crushing Intolerance release with this song. Mar is a band made up of people from strong left-wing backgrounds and thus has a focus on ridding the scene of right-wing poison.
