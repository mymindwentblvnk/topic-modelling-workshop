Amaranthine Lament is a one-person black metal project from Dover, Kent, UK, formed in late 2008. Lyrical themes typically include: abstract/surrealist imagery, the supernatural, dissatisfaction, anti-right-wing politics, internalised thoughts and occasionally, settings of classic literature. 

Musically, the creator aims to use the conventions of black metal in various ways to create something that is unique, or at least memorable - often melding them with outside influences, but still remaining firmly within the black metal genre at its core, although the music does break away from this genre. in some cases.

On an extramusical level, the creator often aims to take the listener out of their current space of existence and project them into an alternate sound-world. In this case, the music is best listened to through headphones, preferably with closed eyes and/or in a darkened room, although this isn't necessarily essential to either enjoy or otherwise gain something from the experience. There is no right or wrong way to listen to it. At this point in time, lyrics are only published when the creator feels they will significantly add to the listener's perception or interpretation of the intended sound-world. 

To date, three demos have been released, the latest and most ambitious yet being the 90-minute "Spirit Geist" cassette, which is the first release on the creator's own D.I.Y. label, Amaranthine Pathways. All three demos are currently available in physical and download forms.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Amaranthine+Lament">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
