Oshawa, Canada.

The cloudy beginnings of VESPERIA lay etched in the gorged bodies of former musical projects among the now 4 piece band. Twisting, writhing and forcing their aural onslaught upon metal audiences across the globe have sincerely ensured the band’s continuity through all the harsh and arduous battles modern metal bands are sure to encounter in their tenures.

Originally formed in 2005 by now lead vocalist/ bassist Morgan Rider as a black metal band, the sound, direction and theme of the music naturally evolved into the style of fierce and heroic metal the band is now known for. Shortly after releasing their long overdue brand folk metal 2011 full-length ‘Voyage from Vinland’, VESPERIA redefined their purpose and direction once and finally with their 2012 demo ‘The Swordsman’, drawing the ears and attention of metal fans around the world.

Now, Vesperia prepare to unleash their newest record ‘An Olden Tale’ upon the unsuspecting masses to demonstrate their true mastery of their craft. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vesperia">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
