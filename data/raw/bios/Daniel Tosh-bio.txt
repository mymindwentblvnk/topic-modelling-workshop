Daniel Tosh is a comedian who currently resides in Los Angeles, CA. He has recently performed on Comedy Central Presents. He has also made appearances on such shows as The Late Show, The Tonight Show, and Premium Blend.

    " Born in Germany but raised in Florida, Tosh's father is a preacher, this often shocks nearly everyone who has ever heard any of his material. In Miami, Tosh hosted/created the late-night tv show "Tens", where he would interview and mock the numerous models who inhabit the city's South Beach area. After touring the comedy club circuit, a successful performance at the respected Just for Laughs international Comedy Festival in Montreal introduced him to the big time. He started appearing in comedy festivals as far away as New Zealand, Ireland, and averaging over 100 college performances a year. He made his first appearance on The Late Show with David Letterman in 2001 and a year later was hosting his first standup special, Comedy Central Presents Daniel Tosh. In 2005 the cable network's record label released his debut, the CD/DVD combo 'True Stories I Made Up'. His sardonic and sarcastic material and the casual way it's delivered has made him a college favourite and a frequent guest of the Comedy Central tv network. His material is sometimes topical, but mostly observational humor." 

He does not care who is in the room. His jokes are snide and sarcastic and he loves to make it uncomfortable for people in the club.

Daniel Tosh attended the University of Central Florida in Orlando.

Currently, Tosh hosts Tosh.0, a show showcasing internet video clips on Comedy Central. In the show, Tosh ridicules people in videos, and finds them in the present and attempts to allow them to redeem themselves. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Daniel+Tosh">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
