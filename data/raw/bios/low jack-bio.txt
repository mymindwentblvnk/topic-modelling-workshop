Low Jack (Philippe Hallais), perfectly personifies the new breed of electronic musician who has grown up between the analog/digital age, using intuitive software programs like Logic and Ableton to spontaneously express ideas and emotions. Always fascinated and interested in analogue drum machines and synthesizers for their warm and deep sound, he performs and produces exclusively with machines like the legendary Roland Tr-909, Tr-808, Tb-303, Elektron MD UW and MM. Online distribution has also made it possible for them to reach out and connect with audiences across the globe, no matter where they are. 

His teenage years were spent listening all kind of music to get the "right personal touch" and playing turntables in clubs around Rome, Italy. At the time it was hard to hear good dance music in Rome apart from one or two tracks that crossed over into the commercial clubs he sometimes visited with friends but that was enough to whet his appetite and he immediately got wrapped up in the beats, connecting with the music on a deeper level. He started exploring the electronic medium and became fascinated by how some DJs could apply their own personal vision to the music, elevating it to an art form. This was exactly the inspiration he needed and he was soon experimenting with loops on his laptop, and buying records (DrumCode, Cadenza, Plus8, Perlon, Spectral and of course Minus) to dj with. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Low+Jack">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
