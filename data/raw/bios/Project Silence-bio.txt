Project Silence is an industrial metal band from Kuopio, Finland. 

Blending industrial and extreme metal to energetic and brutal soundscapes, Project Silence has created its spot in the modern metal scene and made a unique blend of brutal sounds with rhythmic and melancholic beats.

Established in Kuopio by vocalist Delacroix in 2008 , the band's early material was closer to industrial metal and aggrotech based music. As time went on, the band's music began to have heavier tones and electronic elements, industrial elements still being a big part of it.

The band released their first album '424' in 2012, which mixed melodic metal and atmospheric industrial. 2016 band signed a worldwide contract with Sliptrick Records and later the same year they released their second album 'Slave To The Machine', which was heavier with ingredients from death, black and other extreme metal subgenres and the same evolution continued with their latest EP in 2018's 'Infinity' and 'Fallout' single (2021).
