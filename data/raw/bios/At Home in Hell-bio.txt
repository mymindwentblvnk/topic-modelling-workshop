At Home in Hell (AHIH) came together in January of 2005 in Great Falls, Montana.  Their goal was to innovate the local music scene by combining aspects of industrial metal with hardcore.  Stage shows focus heavily on a visual aspect, complete with masks and ultra violet lights to create a haunting stage presence.

AHIH debuted on April 9th 2005. After playing a few shows, they began production of their self-titled debut album.  The self titled album was released on March 25th 2006 by Coalition Recording Artists.
