Necronomichrist is a brutal metal force from Athol, MA. Their first full length album, featuring the original four members(Divoll, Geikie, Plummer, Cycz), entitled "Harlequin Fetus" was released in March 2007. With the addition of two more band mates(O'Brien, Patterson), Necronomichrist found their sound. In April of 2009 Necronomichrist parted ways with original lead guitarist Jimmy Geikie due to professional differences. Guitarist Brian Tracy of Alabaster Wormwood fills the role of Lead Guitarist in the band. Necronomichrist has been playing around the Massachusetts area for the past couple years. In July 2009, Necronomichrist recorded an EP titled The Intimacy of Armageddon. During the recording session the band hired Bill Sawin to replace Cameron Cycz at lead vocals. The EP should be released around Christmas 2009. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Necronomichrist">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
