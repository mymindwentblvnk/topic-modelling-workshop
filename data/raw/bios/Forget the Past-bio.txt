Forget The Past started as a 3-piece in July of 2005. We wrote our first 3 songs in 3 days of existence and shared the stage with acts such as Set Your Goals, Clifton, and I Am The Ocean, among others, and recorded a 5-song demo, within the same month. We are comprised of current and former members of Bleed So Lovely, The Masses, and Clifton. Our music is heavier than Chuck Norris' dick, balls, and the list of women he's fucked while on a Total Gym. Our songs are written about experiences with love, betrayal, friendship, and our own unique values. Please, listen for yourself, and let us know what you think.

UPDATE: We will be re-recording and re-releasing our demo, with a couple bonus songs, withing the next couple of months, so be on the lookout for that! We'll keep you posted right here... <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Forget+the+Past">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
