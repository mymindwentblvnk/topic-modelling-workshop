KARMIC LINK is the (project?) bastard child of Stathis Kassios (ex-keyboard player of Sweden's SYSTEM SHOCK and Greece's NIGHTFALL) who decided after a period of extensive recording and live experience (sharing the same stage with bands like Paradise Lost, Queensryche, Nightwish, Judas Priest, etc.), to give birth to a surrealistic event inside normal timespace. Somewhere around 2006 he started working on some songs while at the same time he recruited the female entity Mina G. (ex-Kinetic, The Rain I Bleed), a charismatic mezzo-soprano, who paradoxically fited this crazy ship of karmic ideas. The link was established and the result was mixed and mastered in the famous TICO TICO studios (Sentenced, Impaled Nazarene, Sonata Arctica, etc.) in Finland. So sinners...beware. The salad so far consists of mediterranean energy, doses of industrial coldness, atmospheric landscapes, progressive spots, instrumental madness, dark pop tunes, electro breakdowns, funky grooves and hard rock pentatonic moments. Why do you read this? You have to find out the Karmic Link into your personal existence. 

The group's debut album is called "No Light but Rather Darkness Visible" and the concept behind this intriguing title, is questioning the Eastern vs Western modern conflict but from a metaphysical point of view. Guest musicians on the CD include Bob Katsionis (FIREWIND), who recorded and performed all rhythm and lead guitars, and Jani Liimatainen (SONATA ARCTICA), who laid down leads on one of the two instrumental songs of the album.
