Capricia was formed in 2002 by guitar players Arnold Nesis and Eran Spira. They began the search for musicians to form a progressive metal band. In their endeavor to find Jerusalemâ€™s top musicians, they found Amit Degrassy (Bass), Uria Mevurach (Keyboard) and Shmuel ushilov (Drums). 
Besides the band members, Capricia works with many classical, metal and jazz artists from Israel and abroad such as Vidi Dolev, Mexican singer Malinaly Reyes (Fractalia), Mexican singer Isadora Cortina, and many others who are soon to be revealed. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Capricia">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
