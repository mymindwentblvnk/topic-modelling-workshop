Cheerleader Concubine is a 2-piece goregrind band from the United States, heavily influenced by guro hentai imagery with a kawaii/chibi approach. Pitch-shifted gurgles, throat-shredding rasps, mechanical high-speed drums, and ultra-drop tuned guitars combine to create a primitive, yet brutal concoction with influence from slam death metal.

This project started in '07 as a joke. Originally, CxCx was a cybergrind influence midi/digi/grind band. In 2008, Cheerleader Concubine released a split LP with Unicorn Hole that featured their cybergrind sound and later in the proceeding years focused on more serious songs through a few MySpace demos featuring real guitars and better production. 

In May of 2014, Cheerleader Concubine made a comeback with their first ever official release entitled Bukkake Birthday Party.
