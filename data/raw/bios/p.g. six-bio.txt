Pat Gubler, a.k.a P.G. Six came on the scene in 1994, as a member of Memphis Luxure, a noise/rock band from Port Chester, NY. That band morphed into The Tower Recordings, a musically omnivorous ensemble that released several albums on the Siltbreeze and Communion labels over the past decade. Pat’s first solo album, “Parlor Tricks and Porch Favorites” (Amish 014) saw the light of day in 2001, followed by “The Well of Memory” (Amish 019) in 2004. “Music From the Sherman Box Series” (AMI 024), a collection of instrumentals arrived in Fall 2006. His music fuses an unlikely range of influences including 60s British folk, country rock, & experimental music. P.G. Six has shared the stage with a variety of performers including: Ghost, Slint, Yo la tengo, Michael Hurley, & The Incredible String Band. His 4th album, Slightly Sorry was released Feb 2007 on Drag City.
