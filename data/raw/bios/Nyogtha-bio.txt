Nyogtha is a doomgaze band from Reading, UK, formed in 2007 by Tanith Griffiths and Edward Radcliffe.
The duo has managed to cultivate a unique blend of spiritual shoegaze and occult drone, combining the melodies of Jesu with the dark atmospheres of Sunn O))) to create a musical experience that transcends the astral plain and takes the listener deeper into the introspective void.
