The Fateful Hour is a doom metal project which was created by Brandon Green and Ben Fortier. Originally it was a studio project, but when the two decided the music really needed to come to life, they recruited some of the most talented metal musicians on the South Shore of Massachusetts. Their dark, brooding sound provokes thoughts of nostalgia and existentialism, evoking a fateful atmosphere.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Fateful+Hour">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
