Beyond Within was formed in the spring of 2002 by founding members Chris Finlay and Paul Larochelle. After customary line-up changes, the band currently consists of 
Todd Pidgeon (vocals) 
Chris Finlay (lead, rhythm guitar) 
Paul Larochelle (drums) 
Dave St-Louis (bass guitar) 
Pat Malette (lead, rhythm guitar) 

The band has been working relentlessly for the last three years sculpting and perfecting their unique sound, which could be somewhat described as European-influenced melodic death/thrash. Persistent practice has greatly improved the skills of each individual member, making the band's presence more intense and unified than ever. 

Beyond Within has played over 100 live shows, sharing the stage with notable acts such as: Cryptopsy, Behemoth, Decapitated,Kataklysm, Skinless, All That Remains, 3 Inches of Blood, Throwdown, Necronomicon, Neuraxis, Quo Vadis, Martyr, Beneath the Massacre, The End, Ion Dissonance, Winter Solstice, Misery Index, Despised Icon and Anvil. 


With a new album recently released , Eternal Pestilence is perhaps the best showcase of their abilities, but is simply a glimpse of what the future holds for Beyond Within.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Beyond+Within">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
