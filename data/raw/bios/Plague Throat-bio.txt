Dishing out brutal death metal, Plague Throat, a 3 piece death metal outfit from Shillong, India, is led by Nangsan Lyngwa (vocals, guitars) accompanied by Iaidon Jyrwa (bass) and Dolreich Bianglang Kharmawphlang (drums) have proved time and again that Shillong’s underground metal scene could never be taken lightly. Being an instant hit among fanatics after the release of their debut EP, ‘An Exordium to Contagion’, the elements of doom which embodies their lyrical contents have now taken them to the next level. The band has been in the live circuit since 2008. The band's single Present Chaos has been featured in many metal compilations released in the country and internationally. The band recorded their self-produced single The Pretentious and the Deceived in 2012 which racked up another compilation entry and created a buzz about Plague Throat as being the next big thing to happen in the burgeoning Indian Extreme metal scenario. They followed it up with their debut EP, An Exordium to Contagion, which was recorded and mixed by the band, and mastered by Srikanth Panaman at Doom Cave, Bangalore and was released via Incanned Productions at Serene Atrocity on the 8th August, 2013 in Shillong. It was followed by Shillong’s biggest extreme metal gig in history and only succeeded in furthering the reputation as a “band so tight that it would give Mother Mary’s cunt quite a shame.” <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Plague+throat">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
