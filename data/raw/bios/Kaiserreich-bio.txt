KAISERREICH was formed in September 2004 by the will of Serpent Est (Chants), Necrobosco (Guitars), Krieg (Drums) and T. Morgan (Bass). On February 2005, once T.Morgan left the band, Necrobosco took his place as bassist. In May, a new guitarist come in the name of Elfire. Finally the band chooses its moniker as KAISERREICH. First live show has been performed the 31st October 2005. A month later, Abraxas joins the oath under the sign of KAISERREICH.

In early 2006, KAISERREICH recordered the eight tracks of their first full length, named KRRH.
Elfire left the band in Spring 2007.
During the summer 2007, Pest, guitarist and singer in his BM band named Inverno, joins the band for few months with no live shows on his side.
On September 2007, KAISERREICH signs under the FUNERAL MOONLIGHT PRODUCTION for the release of the first album. A new reinforcement comes in the name of Luce, as guitarist, on March. Necrobosco left the band due to physical trouble and personal decision. All Honor to him!

Due to the defection of Necrobosco, T. Morgan (the very first guitarist of Kaiserreich who was author of the song “Cross as Diadem” on KRRH) officially joined the band again and composed the “Solitudes of Infinite” song that appears on the 7” split vinyl with the well-knowed french BM band NOCTURAL DEPRESSION.

By the end of 2009, KAISERREICH composes its new album RAVENCROWNED, an epic black metal saga that is coming to light on May 2011 under the aegis of DE TENEBRARUM PRINCIPIO. KAISERREICH signed with the DTP label for two albums and the third opus is already composed and ready to be recordered.

…the Darkness Soldiers on!

Despite the name, KAISERREICH is not a NSBM or a politicized band. KAISERREICH is NOT a satanic nor a declared anti-christian BM band. The name KAISERREICH means “Emperor’s Kingdom” and aims to the magnification of a new order under the guide of the Supreme-Gathered-Will that lies, shattered, deep inside the proud and deserving ones. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kaiserreich">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
