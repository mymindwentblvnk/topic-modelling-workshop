Barshasketh was formed in 2007 as a solo project by Krigeist with the intention of creating pure black metal, intentionally free of genre cross-pollination. Second-wave blasphemy re-imagined and reinterpreted through extensive use of layering and counterpoint. After two well received demos via Wolfsvuur Records, the debut album 'Defying the Bonds of Cosmic Thralldom' emerged in 2010. Following the release of the first full length, Krigeist relocated to Scotland after travelling through south-east Asia. After settling there, he went about piecing together a live lineup and a series of live performances followed, culminating with a show in support of Negative Plane. Out of this live lineup, GM (guitars and vocals) was made a permanent member and BH was recruited on drums. This trio recorded the second full-length, 'Sitra Achra', released in 2013 through Todestrieb Records. After recruiting bassist BB on bass, the lineup was complete and Barshasketh recorded two split EPs in quick succession. The band went on to record a third full length, 'Ophidian Henosis' at the infamous Necromorbus Studio in Stockholm. This most recent full length, brought to you by Blut&Eisen Prod. and World Terror Committee undoubtedly presents the bandâ€™s finest work to date and showcases a new level of musical and lyrical maturity. Extolling an adversarial spirituality, these seven hymns of darkness evangelize the impure and the obscene.
