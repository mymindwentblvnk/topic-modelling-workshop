Navigating an atypical musical expedition, Burnt Friedman’s unusual trajectory curved its way through an adolescent obsession with drums and a singular dedication to amassing a self-recorded audio-library dating from 1978. What followed in the late 80ties was a period of art academia, then immersion in the first flurry of collaborative music projects. Since 1993 he released records under various names, such as Nonplace Urban Field or Drome and began working as Flanger with Uwe Schmidt aka Atom™. As a result of annual travels to Australia and New Zealand the Nu Dub Players took shape in 1997. In the year 2000 Friedman founded his own record label, Nonplace, to ensure continuity for independent musical adventures like collaborations with Jaki Liebezeit (Burnt Friedman & Jaki Liebezeit) or The Nu Dub Players (Burnt Friedman & The Nu Dub Players). Besides, Friedman started a collaboration with David Sylvian and Steve Jansen.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Burnt+Friedman">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
