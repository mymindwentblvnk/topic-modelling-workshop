MONS LVNAE (Mount of the Moon) were formed in the Summer of 1998 by the hand of three friends. Although initially the sound of the band was more based on Black/Death/Doom Metal, by the passage of time, it started to sound more and more with Goth/Folk Metal. Through the years, MONS LVNAE had a lot of changes in it's Line-Up, but still the band has managed to record three demos: IMPERIVM LVNAE (2002), REVIDERE AD VITAM (2005) & Seven Winds (2007).
