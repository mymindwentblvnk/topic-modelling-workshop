Ascend the Fallen is a hardworking dedicated band hailing from Pittsburgh, PA. Their style includes heavy breakdowns, yet extremely melodic riffs, jaw dropping solos, fast paced creative drumming and a vocal mixture of high pitch screams and lower than low death growls. "ATF" has everything a metal fan wants. And to top it off ATF's live performances blow everything away. These guys bring it all to the stage every time they play. Some influences are All Shall Perish, The Acacia Strain, Parkway Drive, Whitechapel, Between the Buried and Me, In Flames, Darkest Hour.
