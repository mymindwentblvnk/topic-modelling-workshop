1.) The Hollow is a hardcore band formed in Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia in 2008

2.) The band formerly known as The Meathooks. The Hollow are a rock band formed in New Jersey. http://thehollowband.com/

There might be some confusion... I think there's 2 bands on here named The Hollow... one from Australia (Hardcore band) and the other from the United States (New Jersey)... rock band... somehow their profiles, music, photos, information seemed to have been merged, but please note these are 2 entirely different and unrelated bands. The album titled "The Hollow" (released in September 2010) and all tracks on it are from the United States band The Hollow whose website is http://www.thehollowband.com. They have no affiliation whatsoever with The Hollow from Australia. Thanks! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Hollow">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
