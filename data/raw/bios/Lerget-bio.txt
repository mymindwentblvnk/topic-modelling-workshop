Lerget is a solo project, formed by Lukas Flarer in 2007 in South-Tyrol, Italy.
"My idea was to create a pure and honest sound. To create something special, I wrote the lyrics in the Southtyrolian dialect, which is very important for me. I love our old language and therefore my decision was to write all the lyrics in this language. I think it gives you the feeling of mystic fairytales which may happen in our dark woods..."
Lukas Flarer started his work on "...und schun poll isch Wintor..." in 2002. At that time he didn't know, that once he will record a whole CD. It first was just for himself. Than, after writing 2 or 3 songs, he had the idea to start a solo project. That was the time when LERGET was born.
