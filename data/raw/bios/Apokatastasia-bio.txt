The group was formed in 1998 by Milan (guitar), Dave (Cello) and Lolo (drums) under the name Radical Moon. First instrumental songs to be by style associated with progressive/art rock were created. In the beginning of 1999 the group was joined by bass player Kürsti which created of us the formation called Schizophriend. After hours of practice we started giving first concerts. The positive respose from the public stimulated us to go further into a rockier region and metal found its way into our songs.
Beginning 2000 Dario took place on the drums and starting at summer 2001 we continuously played gigs and made the definite name change to Apokatastasia with Lolo finally taking the fifth position as a manager/promoter of the band.
The new songs turned out to be more technical, metallic and multi-faceted but are still mainly instrumental. The ich arose to produce a CD so in August 2002 we went to the studios and in March 2003 we released our four-song demo CD "Waiting Four". The songs give a good outline of our work so far and the the way we express in music. After an intesen search for an appropriate bass player in summer  2003 we could count Markus Bach amongst us who is taking the bass part in the recent songs so that Kürsti now can take part with his guitar.
In April 2004 we started producing the new album "Shedding" which came out in August 2005 and was in many aspects an important step for Apo.
At the moment we are busy creating new songs and already have enough material to produce another complete album!  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Apokatastasia">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
