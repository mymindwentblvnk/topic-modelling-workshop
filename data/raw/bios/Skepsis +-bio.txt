Skepsis Positive is a metal band from Pula, Croatia. They were formed in the beginning of the year 2001 under the name ''Nailed''. Recently name was changed to ''Skepsis Positive'' because of some legal issues. Along the years they had some line-up changes, but now the line-up is strong.

They have recorded 3 demo CD's. The first one was recorded in 2003 and is called "<b>World Collapse 2003". There was also recorded a video supporting that demo album, for the track "Redrum".The second demo EP was recorded in 2004-05 and is called "A moment of clarity". The last demo, ''Scream Your Scars'' is the first one "released" under the new name, and it includes 8 songs.

They held approximately 100 live performances. It's quite a few considering that Croatia's metal community is fairly small, and is segregated from the European metal world. They opened for three big bands. These were SEPULTURA in Zagreb (29.06.03.), SOULFLY, Zagreb (13.06.04.) and ANTHRAX (25.06.05) also in Zagreb.
