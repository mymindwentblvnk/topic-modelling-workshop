Formed in 2007, and after undergoing a series of sound and line-up changes, Two Rivers, Wisconsin’s 5 piece death metal Micawber has
finally found a sound of their own and is definitely making an impact on today’s metal community. Micawber strives to break away from the slow, boring, half-time chugs that have infected the metal scene today, while still maintaining enough energy in their music to put on an intense live show. With two self released
CD’s behind them and a relentless tour schedule ahead of them, make sure to keep an eye out for Micawber in a city near you as they
thrash through the boundaries
