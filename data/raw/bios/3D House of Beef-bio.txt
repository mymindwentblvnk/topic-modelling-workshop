3d House Of Beef is a band originally from Seattle, Washington. They released 2 cassette EPs ("Crowning on a Ferris Wheel" and "Lazgrodin/Zosaval"), a remix EP ("Similar Attack Pattern"), 2 full length CD albums (self-titled and "Low Cycle"), as well as appearing on several international music compilations. They were one of the first US based bands to incorporate sonic elements of industrial music, heavy metal, and experimental noise along with the ideology and lyrical content of punk and post rock into live performances and recorded output. In 1997 the band was labeled by now defunct Seattle music magazine The Rocket (newspaper) as being "the heaviest band in Seattle, ever".

The bands early recording output was immediately championed by the UK press as being a revolutionary new direction for Pacific Northwest music away from the frenzy of grunge music that had overtaken the region. Hailed with a four 'K' rating from English magazine Kerrang! and stellar reviews from AC/DC biographer Malcolm Dome, the band was rapidly catapulted to the top of the underground music scene overseas.
