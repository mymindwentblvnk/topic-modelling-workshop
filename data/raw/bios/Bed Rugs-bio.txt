Bed Rugs is an indie/rock band from Antwerp, Belgium. 

The band is a continuation of The Porn Bloopers (finalists in the prestigious HUMO's Rock Rally in 2008). The name changed, the line-up remained the same: Yannick Aerts, Stijn Boels, Arne Omloop, Noah Melis.

The sound of Bed Rugs has been described as "slightly psychedelic" and a mixture of "sixties westcoast pop" and "nineties indie rock". A d√©but album entitled, 8th Cloud came out in early 2012. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bed+Rugs">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
