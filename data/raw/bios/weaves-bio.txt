Weaves is a Canadian indie pop band from Toronto, Ontario, consisting of vocalist Jasmyn Burke, guitarist Morgan Waters, drummer Spencer Cole and bassist Zach Bines.

Their style could be described as a blend of catchy indie pop with raw garage rock sounds, coined as "bubblegrunge" by The Guardian. 

The band was formed in 2012 by Burke and Waters, who first met each other in a bar and began recording demo songs based on files of song ideas Burke recorded on her iPhone. In 2013, Bines and Cole joined the band shortly before recording commenced on their debut EP. They released the self-titled debut EP in 2014, and followed up with a self-titled full-length album in 2016.

The 2016 album was shortlisted for both the Juno Award for Alternative Album of the Year and the 2017 Polaris Music Prize in 2017, as well as garnering a SOCAN Songwriting Prize nomination for the song "Shithole".

The band's second full-length album, Wide Open, was released on October 6, 2017. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Weaves">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
