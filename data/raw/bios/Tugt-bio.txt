Tugt is a Black/Doom metal project with folk influences from Zealand, Denmark. Founded in 2012.
The Lyrics, which are sung in the Danish language, deal with suffering, solitude, decay, the darkness inside, the beauty of nature and philosophy

Tugt distances itself from politics, religion and other human errors
