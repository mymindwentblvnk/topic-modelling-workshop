Dusks Embrace is a melodic death metal band from Salem, Oregon. The band is made up of Josh Brewer, Joey Westerlund, Josh Mendoza and Brandon Callicott.

Dusks Embrace was founded by Josh Brewer and Pat Carter in the fall of 2006. Pat and Josh spent the next year and a half looking for the right members and beginning to write material for a full length album. In the summer of 2008 Josh Mendoza joined the band as bassist and Brandon Callicot joined on the drums. With this line up the first album Paradigm Shift was recorded.

After a few months supporting this album the band began writing for the second full length release. During this time Pat decided to pursue other interests. He was then replaced by Joey Westerlund on guitar. With this line up the band played many shows supporting Paradigm Shift. Playing shows with Whitechapel, Katatonia, Ensiferum, All Shall Perish and many others. As well as the 2010 Vans Warped Tour.

During the recording of the second album Mendoza decided to leave the band, but has since returned on bass. The second album titled "The Twilight Enigma" was released digitally in September of 2010 and the physical album will be released in 2011. Check it out now on iTunes or CDBaby
