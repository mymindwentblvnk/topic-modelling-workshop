==================================

BLOODSOAKED (MX)  - early 1990's

Bloodsoaked was one of the first bands doing this style of music in Mexico. They were one of the main opening bands for the international bands who toured Mexico. They opened up for such bands as Obituary, Rotting Christ, and did a tour with Napalm Death and Sadistic Intent in 1991. More popular mexican band The Chasm's first show was opening up for Bloodsoaked at the Frost Image release show.

The band would later move to Seattle, Washington USA where the band would form as Sol Negro. It is a more Black/Doom style of music which is more like the groups side project from the early 90's Damnation then Bloodsoaked, but Bloodsoaked is considered pre-Sol Negro.

José owned a record store in Mexico City where he sold and distributed metal albums to the underground, and also helped fellow mexican bands get their albums sold.

José was nicknamed Jeff growing up in Mexico and he appears under that name.
