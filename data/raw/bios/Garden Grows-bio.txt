Garden Grows is a music project by musician/composer/producer Niels Paul. Originally founded in 1999 as Karlosis in Bremen, Germany (currently based in DÃ¼sseldorf) it was renamed to Garden Grows in 2002.

Since its foundation GG evolved from a trashy britpop inspired project to a sleek alt-pop act in 2006.

In 2007 Niels Paul was debuting as a singer-songwriter releasing his first self written lyrics and continuing his new raw sound. He also founded several other projects such as Five Minutes and One Day and Saving Friday

In October of that year Garden Grows returned to its lush atmospheric sound it was known from 2006's "Up In the Sky" with the song The View. Since then several shoegaze inspired songs were released.
