There are two bands called A Tree:

1. A Tree is an amazing noise act with surpasses all existential angst and encompasses serenity through sacrilege. Born from the bowels of Ohio, Mark Cronin (Yay, AIDS! / Rap-ture / A Thousand Millenia Curse) and Andrew Rahman (Churches Burn / Golden Cloud / Consciousness / Day of Pentecost) shit an audible disaster. This experiment side-project only recorded a handful of songs and never played out, but it still holds a special place in their hearts. May A Tree hold a special place in your heart as well.

2. Hailing from Potenza, Italy, A Tree play a mixture of Depressive Black Metal and Post-Rock. Although tagged as 'depressive' Black Metal, the music a very upbeat and uplifting.

So far only one demo album has been recorded called Fn-2+Fn-1=Fn, consisting of 6 truly beautiful songs.

P.S. any record labels, he's unassigned ;)
