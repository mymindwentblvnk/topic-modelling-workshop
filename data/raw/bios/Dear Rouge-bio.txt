Dear Rouge is a Juno award-winning Vancouver-based electronic rock band formed in 2012 by Drew and Danielle McTaggart.

In the summer of 2009, Danielle & Drew were touring separately across Canada, pursuing music projects. Finding they had a true connection, they began to talk of collaborating. This led them into a Vancouver studio in 2010, where they created the single “Heads Up. Watch Out.” After receiving positive feedback from music industry leaders and local fans, they toured together through Europe the following summer. While touring they decided to officially join together in creating a truly unique, creative sound “Dear Rouge”. They have completed their first EP, and are currently working on their first full length album.The band's name is a wordplay on Red Deer, a city in Alberta, Canada. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dear+Rouge">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
