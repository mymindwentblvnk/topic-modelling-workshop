The beginning to our journey starts fucking today!! With the guitar attack of Joe, vocal decimation of Dave (who at one point in their musical existence had shared the stage together with the thrash / speed metal band Section 8, '94 - '95), skin bashing of Garrett and the razor leads of Reverend Sean!! The name is EMBRACE DAMNATION and the new album debut titled "Glory Of A New Darkness" will hit the streets September 2009!! The lyrics are written of fallen angels guided with the leadership of Heavens highest arch angel, Lucifer, and condemned to everlasting holocaust in the decrepit ruins of Hell which has been waiting for such a power to take reign and boycott and cast war on the lies that besieged this wretched planet!! Come and rejoice with the anthems of a much darker and truthful way of life that will relieve the pains and sorrow of Christian hypocritical ways!!

Embrace Damnation, rises unholier and darker than ever to give the ultimate end on godâ€™s feeble plan.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Embrace+Damnation">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
