There is more than one artist with this name: 

1. Bana Shirwan (born 4 March 2001 in Sulaymaniyah, Iraq), known simply as BANA is a Kurdish world music singer and songwriter whose 2019 music video for the song "Bochi" was viewed more than 1 million times on her official YouTube channel.

2. A Cape Verdean morna singer, Bana got a start in the music business in the 1950s, transporting crippled composer B. Leza from concert hall to concert hall. Perhaps on account of his popularity, Bana found himself accused of collaboration with the colonial Portuguese government, and unable to escape the stigma of these accusations, he moved to Europe, basing himself in Rotterdam, Paris, and more recently, in Lisbon. In addition to being a singer, Bana has also moved into producing and has worked in this capacity with Cesaria Evora.
