Early days - Human (2006 - 2007)

Whole idea of project "in human form" was born in head of its only founder, ondrishko, drummer of rock band called Revenge!!! in an early days of 2006, as a very speculative attempt entitled Human. As he experienced impossibility of getting rid of patologic moods in any other way, he started with composing sick electronic ambient, which he had never seriously though about publishing. Without any knowledge, or experience, he started with programming first tracks, if it can be called that way ^^. In those days, first things came into existence; namely Sadistic, Philantrophy (primal version), etc.

Word by word, one year later, Kura, fascinated by sound and atmosphere of Human, decided to join the project as a second programmer. As well as new member, Human changed also its name: from now on it was called in human form.

Songs like Plane Crash Test, Broken Mirror, Hypocrite etc. happened. Today, in human form (which is a side-project) have a creative break, songs come into existence only sporadically. After a longer pause, authors bestirred themselves (maybe because of that christmas atmosphere) and created few new songs as Vesm√≠rna Odyssea or Psychedelic classical dance.

From time to time, authors create new songs, generally to solve their actual personal problems or to feed their craving to destroy or deform. Personal life of project founder, haunted him so much, that in a short time, two songs were made: Infect the Debugger, Saturation 75 and then third song Keep on Rottin', which is still in the phase of completion.
