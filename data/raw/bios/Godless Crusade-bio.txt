Formed in 2005, Godless Crusade plays an arsenal of loud black influenced melodic death metal. Coming together as a five piece from former members of Unbreath they have fast developed a natural chemistry, allowing them to constantly evolve as musicians, aiming beyond the simple, straight-forward songwriting that plagues a lot of bands in their genre. Based in Vicenza (Italy), they have been making an uproar across Europe since their 2007 debut release “Dawn Of The Last Day” on Thirty Days Of Night Records (UK).
Actually, Godless Crusade plans on hitting the road by the end of the year and have many plans in store for unleashing and creating one of the most emotionally charged and powerful records they could possibly make.

There is also another band with this monicker, i.e. an old school thrash metal from Southern Germany. The band Godless Crusade existed from 2006 till early 2008 and split up after lineup problems. In 2015 Jan Heidelberger (guitars, bass) and René (vocals) met again and revived Godless Crusade.
