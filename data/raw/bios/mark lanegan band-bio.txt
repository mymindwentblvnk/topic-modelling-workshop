Mark Lanegan (born November 25, 1964) is an American rock musician and songwriter. Lanegan began his music career in the 1980s, forming the grunge group Screaming Trees with Gary Lee Conner, Van Conner and Mark Pickerel. During his time in the band Lanegan would start a low-key solo career. Besides Screaming Trees, Lanegan also found moderate success and good recognition from his solo projects and also joining, for a time, hard rock band Queens of the Stone Age giving contributions on the critically and commercially successful albums Rated R, Songs for the Deaf and Lullabies to Paralyze.

Since leaving the Queens of the Stone Age in 2005, Lanegan has worked with fellow Gutter Twin Greg Dulli's Twilight Singers as well as collaborating with Soulsavers and former Belle and Sebastian singer and cellist Isobel Campbell (on three albums).
