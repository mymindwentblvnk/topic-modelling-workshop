Virginia Wing are a Manchester-based trio consisting of Alice Merida Richards (vocals, keyboards), Sam Pillay (guitar, keyboards) and Sebastian Truskolaski (drums). They released their debut album "Measures Of Joy" in 2014, followed by "Forward Constant Motion" in 2016.

"... Virginia Wing are not from the sedate school of dream-pop escapism. It's just that, like Broadcast or Stereolab before them, they possess that same innate ability to seemingly pause time and space, so that that any number of stylistic meditations – in this case cyclical repeato-rock, synthetically-manipulated shoegaze, 90s-inspired hauntology – are applied amidst an overriding sense of uninterrupted still." - The Quietus
