Funk Factory is Funk Fusion band that was headed up by Polish music legends Michal Urbaniak and Urszula Dudziak, plus a heavy dose of American studio musicians. These included drummers like Steve Gadd and Gerald Brown, who both kept up the beat throughout the record on different tracks. Along with these American players, there were even more European cats, who meshed perfectly with their American Funk brothers and sisters.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Funk+Factory">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
