Cut Hands is a tribal noise project from Edinburgh, Scotland, formed in 2008 by William Bennett, the guiding force behind the recently rested Whitehouse.

Bennett will always be known first and foremost for the scummy, excoriating power electronics sound that has been Whitehouse's bread and butter since the late 1970s, but he's always explored his own highly idiosyncratic path through music. Cut Hands finds Bennett indulging his love of the African, particularly Ghanaian and Congolese, percussion that he has avidly collected over the years; its sound is an aggressive but dizzyingly psychedelic composite of machine and acoustic vaudou rhythm, carefully constructed at his home studio over the course of several years.
