Wood of Suicides was formed in 2006 by A. Mochan on drums (also of Dissymmetry and Fouldearth) and G. Samson on bass/vocals. Upon recruiting L. Voltz on guitar (also of Trod), their drone/black metal sound started to take shape. They released their self-titled debut album in 2009. 

Not long after their debut release, G. Samson left the band due to irreconcilable differences. A. and L. jammed for two and a half years while auditioning various bass players/vocalists. 

J. Cachia (previously of Praetorian) joined in the Winter of 2013 filling the void of bass and vocals. J.’s melodic metal background and L.’s ever developing guitar style ushered in a new sound combining doom, drone and more musical passages punctuated by A.’s heavy hitting drumming. 

Between 2013 and 2016 the band have been developing their sound, and in late October 2016 they released their sophomore album “Tree of Woe.”
