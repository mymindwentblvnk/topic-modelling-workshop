It should come as no surprise that after years of touring with his band Monotonix that Yonatan Gat would carry that same intensity in his own act. Live, his power trio is experienced on the floor inside the audience, with contrasted lighting pointing at the band members as they tear through "a wholly fresh fusion of psychedelic sounds and rhythms from around the globe, with nods to free jazz and served with an unabashed punk spirit". Gat's wildly inventive guitar assumes simultaneous lead and rhythm roles, blending punk rock with Middle Eastern styles, backed by Gal Lazer's hard-hitting African-influenced grooves and Sergio Sayeg's (of Brazilian psychedelic rockers Garotas Suecas) melodic anchor. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Yonatan+Gat">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
