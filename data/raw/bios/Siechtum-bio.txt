1) Siechtum is the side project of L'ame Immortelle's main man, Thomas Rainer. Siechtum takes a much more power noise approach with it's structures, however. The first two albums were strictly noise endeavors with no vocals and limited dialogue samples but focusing on percussive beats. With the last album: "diagnose:zeit" we still find the percussive beats but along with them, we find vocals and more structured song flow as well. 

2) Siechtum is also ecocentric depressive black metal from Germany https://soundcloud.com/user-2017842 <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Siechtum">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
