The band Empty Book was founded back in 2001. Guitarist and band founder Ivan Souza wanted to make a folkish sound, with depressive and melancholic lyrics. Violinist Cleiton Fernandes was invited to join the project in 2003. Cleiton then introduced Ivan to the singer Márcia Raquel. After perceiving the extension of her voice, Ivan then changed his musical ambitions into a heavier and more dramatic style.

Drummer Ricardo França also joined the group, along with bassist Diógenes. Combining popular Brazilian music characteristics with traditional heavy metal influences, Empty Book's style converged into a unique style, with fast changes and evolutions, but preserving many old-school features like the guttural vocals and fast guitar riffs - both innovating and conservative at the same time.

In 2006, keyboarder Raphael Carvalho joined the band, and his power metal knowledge rendered Empty Book a more atmospheric, rather neoclassical style. Back then, Clodoaldo replaced Diógenes as the bass player, and he was largely accepted by the band's audience. By the end of 2007, Raphael left the band due to his new job, but transmitted his composition "Sonata n1 in E minor" to Ivan, who decided to use it as an album-closing bonus. Demitrix Savey replaced Raphael as keyboard player with great success. A little earlier than that, Clodoaldo also left his position, and J. Gabriel jumped in.

Empty Book's lyrics always resemble to mysticism and fantasy, along with poetry, philosophy, and a well-known, gothic-like melancholy. Nowadays, the band are looking for a new bassist.
