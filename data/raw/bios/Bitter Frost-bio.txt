Chris Erikson was raised outside of Stockholm, Sweden. At an early age he was exposed to metal; European power metal. It was not until he heard Yngwie Malmsteen's - Rising Force album that he was inspired to pick up the guitar and play. After years of practicing and moving to America he started toying with the idea of creating a band. That did not end well and he ended up firing 13 different musicians. In frustration he decided to become a one man band and do everything himself.

Bitter Frost was formed back in 2004 by Chris Erikson and Stacey Rugley. Their influences where Emperor and Windir at the time. Chris always had Yngwie as an influence in his guitar playing so the focus was to create extreme metal with a melodic twist. After years of playing around with recording Chris decided to get serious about actually releasing an album, so to retain his vision for the project he parted ways with Stacy. However they both worked together on another Project called Oplexicon. This partnership was later dissolved and it's results can be seen in the Oplexicon Suite at the end of the Debut album.

It took Chris many years to finally be satisfied with his musical direction and audio engineering skills. So in the beginning of 2009 he started to compile all of his songs together to bring them to perfection. Out of 35 different songs 13 where selected.

The idea of having multiple vocalists on the album was to bring variety to the singing, black metal vocals can often be very monotone and repetitive, so he invited friends and local musicians to participate in the album.
