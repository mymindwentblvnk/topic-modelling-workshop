Wigan based guitarist Pete Wadeson, a former member of TROJAN and TALIÃ–N, recorded a solo demo entitled 'Play With Fire' in 1992. Contributing musicians included bassist Eddy Martin and drummer Lee Jackson. Wadeson also took time out to contribute the solo track 'Thrill Of The Chase' along with bass player Tony Schofield and drummer Dave Edwards to the Japanese released compilation 'Metal For Muthas '92' compilation.

In 1994 Wadeson and Schofield formed BETRAYED. In 1995 he issued an instrumental demo, 'Burnout', before later turning up as a Rock journalist for Brazil's 'Rock Brigade' magazine. 1999 found the man unsuccessfully auditioning for ex-IRON MAIDEN vocalist Blaze Bayley's new band and for MARSHALL LAW. The guitarist also distributed a solo demo tape billed 'Burnout'. In 2001 Wadeson was briefly involved with Martin Walkyier's RETURN TO THE SABBAT project but departed before any live work.

Wadeson would opt out of the music business to concentrate on a career as a specialist author, publishing the books 'Total Airguns' and 'The Complete Guide to Hunting with Air Rifles'.
