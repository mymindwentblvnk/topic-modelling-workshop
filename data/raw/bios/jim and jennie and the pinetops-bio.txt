Jim & Jennie met in 1998 in the wilds of Pennsylvania. Jennie Benford grew up in a bluegrass-lovin' family, full of Stanley Brothers, Bill Monroe and the like, but spent her teen years trying to figure out the meaning of the cover of Zeppelin's "Houses of the Holy." Jim Krewson spent his formative years immersed in hardcore punk and experimental rock, not flipping for the 'grass until he heard his dad's Flatt & Scruggs Mercury recordings.

After meeting up with banjo-prodigy Brad Hutchinson, they set out to fulfill their ambition of winning over both the bluegrass crowd and a broader audience that wasn't necessarily familiar with it. Since then, they released two studio albums, a live, tour-only CD, toured the world, contributed backing skills to Neko Case's live CD The Tigers Have Spoken, and made good on their promise to rocket bluegrass into the 21st century.

They remained respectful of the traditions of the genre, but never constrained by them.
