Infandous started off as a grunge band in the late 90's. Then changed their direction to a Death Metal/Grindcore sound. The band originated in Waterloo, Iowa. The band was started by twin brothers Luke and John Sires. The band was forced to split up in May 2008 due to Luke developing severe carpal tunnel syndrome.
