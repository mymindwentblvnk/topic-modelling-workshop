Gods of Blitz is Berlin natives Sebastian Gaebel on vocals and bass, Olli Wong and Jens Freudenberg on guitars, and Jakob Kiersch on drums. They perform a pop-friendly style of indie rock, with strong punk and metal influences.

Their debut album, Stolen Horse (2005), has garnered praise throughout German media, as well as assorted Australian music magazines, including Rolling Stone.  With production from Torsten Otto (Beatsteaks) and Gordon Raphael (The Strokes, Wildhearts) and mixing by Michael Ilbert (The Hives, The Cardigans, Hellacopters), the band delivers a sound familiar to the American and British indie scene currently dominating radio and music television.

Gods of Blitz have supported Wolfmother, Maximo Park, The Undertones and Nick Olivieri (ex-Queens of the Stone Age). The band released their second album, Reporting a Mirage, in 2007 and toured extensively. 

In 2008 the singer left the band and moved to Sweden to form the group Fox Machine. Gods of Blitz continued with a new singer and keyboards instead of bass, released one album, but disbanded inofficially after one tour. 

Gods of Blitz have recently announced two reunion concerts with the original line-up, comprising Sebastian Gaebel on vocals and bass. Lido, Berlin May 25th and 27th 2012.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gods+of+Blitz">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
