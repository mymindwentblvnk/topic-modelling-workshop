torture machine is an industrial-metal band with electro and ambient influences. Based in Syracuse, New York, it is the combined effort of many local musicians with many different influences, although only one of it's members is considered permanent. Though very rare demos have been circulating for some time, it is not until spring of 2011 that torture machine is expected to release their debut record. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Torture+machine">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
