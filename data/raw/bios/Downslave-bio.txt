Started in 2003 by Scotty Roc, Downslave is a southern influenced metal band with hints of old school thrash. Like most bands they would go through several line up changes. In 2007 finally releasing an EP titled "Vision Of War" this would help the band get established in the scene and help them secure shows. Parting ways with original drummer and picking up current drummer Scott Campbell helped them achieve speed as they desperately needed. With the new addition on drums and the adding of second guitarist Dalton Cochran to the band. Setting there sights on the writing of there full length album.Independently releasing "Cost Of Freedom" in 2010 recorded and produced by Cory "Flattus Maximus" Smoot" of GWAR. At Karma Studios. Spawned many shows and touring. It help the band snag an endorsement with JAGERMIESTER. With there fan base growing locally and regionally Downslave have been asked to do several direct support shows for such acts as Devildriver and Megadeth in there home town. Cost Of Freedom helped them establish themselves,but just wasn't enough. Knowing they needed a follow up to Cost Of Freedom they started writing for a new release. Downslave was pushed in a position to let original front man Brad Parker go. It was the best thing for the band as a whole. Recruiting new front man Nathan Queen via a craigslist ad. This would breath new life into the band as they are currently working on the new release do out in May 2013. With many shows currently being booked Downslave plans a busy year of touring! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/DownSlave">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
