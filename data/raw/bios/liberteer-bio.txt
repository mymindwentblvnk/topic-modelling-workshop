LIBERTEER unleashes a ferocious and wholly unique anarcho grindcore rebellion on their debut "Better To Die On Your Feet Than Live On Your Knees". The creation of Matthew Widener (CRETIN, CITIZEN), LIBERTEER merges scathing anarcho-grind with triumphant passages and stirring riffs, creating a blasting war march that espouses nothing less than total anarchy. Even more incendiary lyrically than musically, LIBERTEER is the soundtrack to a populace casting off the chains of state, church and economic oppression, and fighting tooth and nail to recapture personal freedom. For those who like Ass√ºck, Agathocles, Archagathus, Magrudergrind or Kill The Client.
