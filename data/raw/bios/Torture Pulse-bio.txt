TORTURE PULSE is a brainchild of Kimmo(ex-Mythos voc/gtr), Jani (ex-Belial/Impaled Nazarene-bass) and Petri (Scent/Pathos Gazette-drums).However Jani had to leave because he wanted to concentrate on his studies and his main band PLAN-E. After quite a long search Jani was replaced by Ari (Sigil).

The search continued, and they found a singer from the gutters of Oulu. They heard some infernal noices coming from the sewer systems, and there he was: the Man, the Voice, the Myth, the Beast -- ARTTU the ABOMINATION (Pathos Gazette) .
