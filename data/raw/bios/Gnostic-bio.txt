Gnostic was formed in January of 2005 when guitarist Sonny Carson (CORPSEWORM, SEVERED) and bassist Stephen Morley (CORPSEWORM, AOS, CAUSTIC THOUGHT) met up with drummer Steve Flynn (ATHEIST). Timing, it seems, is everything. Flynn was a founding member of the legendary technical death metal metal pioneers Atheist, and parted ways with the band in 1992, but it wasnâ€™t until December of 2004 that Flynn decided he wanted to get back into playing seriously, and began searching for musicians in Atlanta. Flynn put out a message on Atlantamusican.com that briefly outlined his experience and said he was looking to form a band with like-minded musicians based in the area.
