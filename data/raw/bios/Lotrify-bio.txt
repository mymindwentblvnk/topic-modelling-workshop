Lotrify is a melodic metal band with 5 members from around Baden (Switzerland), which was raised out of a school project in 2008. Towards the end of January 2009, drummer Silvan Kamber left the band. It took the band half a year to find a replacement which was Marc Kunfermann. 
They used the time without a drummer to write songs although they weren't practiced then. In spring 2010 Lotrify played their first two live shows. But still they didn't work the way they wanted, so Marc left the band after one year of working together. After another drummer change Lotrify is complete again with Johannes Senesi since July 2010. 
In winter 3 self-organized shows followed (Bonebreaker Ball Vol. 1 to 3) together with the recording of a demo CD and 3 other shows. Future project plans will include a second Bonebreaker Ball Tour in fall 2011. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lotrify">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
