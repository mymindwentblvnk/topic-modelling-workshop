Anfauglir was formed in 2004 by Griss and former bassist Ungoliant. 
Upon writing and forging a path for the band, they sought the percussion expertise of Necrosarro who entered shortly after the creation of the band. 

Lord Bauglir was asked to join the band for a role as the second guitarist. After accepting the offer, the band took a step in the symphonic direction due to the musical tastes of Lord Bauglir. 
The music began to progress and the orchestral arrangements begot more and more complex. Due to the complexities of the songs and the demands on instrumentalists, recording was pushed back further and further. At which time, Necrosarro and Ungoliant decided to pursue other bands leaving Anfauglir. 
So with the current formation of Griss on guitar and vocals; Lord Bauglir on vocals, guitar, orchestral arrangements and programming, the band continued to write and prepare for recording independently. 

Currently, Anfauglir is in the recording and mixing process for their first full length CD, Hymns over Anfauglith, which is expected to be completed by early 2008.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Anfauglir">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
