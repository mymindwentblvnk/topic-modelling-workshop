Silent Elegy is a symphonic metal band from Beijing, China. Their orchestral arrangement, combined with melodic metal, opera-style female singing and guttural growing, is just like the conversation between an evil and an angel. Lyrics desperately call for love and redemption. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Silent+Elegy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
