Wannsee is a band born some years ago, in north-east of Vinland (Quebec, Canada). At first, Wannsee was only reflecting the musical vision of G.W. Othala, following his departure from a band with whom he was less and less sharing the ideas and musical tendencies. The first songs were quickly written and recorded, without any vocals.

Wannsee's music could be described as a cold industrial black metal, sometimes with doomish influences, insisting on war-like and spiritual emotions rather than blind musical violence. The band Released a new EP under Creative Commons Licence in June 2008. Features members of Nacht und Nebel <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wannsee">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
