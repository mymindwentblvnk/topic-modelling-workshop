Circle Spectre Haunting are a Progressive Death Metal Band from Blackpool, England. Combining a classic death metal ideology with modern and fresh methods of writing they follow the path of bands such as Between the Buried and Me, The Faceless and Atheist that utilize the dark themes and riffs of death metal but with the strange feelings and grooves of jazz and prog rock. 

They currently have a 3 track, 30 minute Extended Play released titled "Scur Of Amduscias" up for free download on there facebook page. The EP is a concept about a battle between the demon "Amduscias" and a Wizard named "Ignatius".
