There are 4 Infantrys.

1) Black/Thrash band
2) Rac/Punk band
3)Martial/Ambient
4) Thrash/death metal band from the Netherlands.

1) Infantry started in 2005,Jessie, Jorge, and Jerry started a band looking forward to playing metal.When Jerry introduced thrash metal into the band,their passion for music changed with Jerry on Guitar, Jorge on Bass and Vocals,and Jessie on Drums.In May 2007 Infantry released the "Ressurect" demo and started playing several shows.Later Henry from Witchaven asked Jerry to join his band,Infantry refused the idea but had no control over Jerry's decision. Their music was progressing slowly at that time.As time went by,Infantry met Tim,a guitarist recently out of a band who shared the same interests for music as the band,this completed the band as a four piece.A few months later Infantry fortunetly managed to release their second demo "Desecrate the Church".As the band predicted,in May 2008,Jerry left Infantry to fulfill his duties in Witchaven. Recently after Jerry left the band,Adrian from Tyrant was looking for more of a heavier,faster,thrash band and saw the opportunity and joined the band to pursue his musical needs.Infantry is still moving forward and has new material yet to be released.
