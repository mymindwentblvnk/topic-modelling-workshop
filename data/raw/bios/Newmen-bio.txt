NEWMEN is a five-piece band distilling noise out of pop jungle(s), post garage(s) and neo wave(s).
A sound experience oscillating between asphalt, sun and disco. A synthetic-, analog-, symbiotic event. A turn to a new realism of sound by serving the last centuryâ€™s modern. Because the new makes up in height for what it lacks in length. Where the robot sings over reason, we push him to take a dive. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Newmen">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
