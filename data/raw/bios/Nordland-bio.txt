Currently 2 bands are named Nordland.

1: Nordland (uk) black metal band from the North East England, creation of Vorh.
Nordland is a one man black metal crusade, a metaphor, a place for the misanthropic minded. Nordland is cold old world hatred for modern humanity. Nordland is a love of the silent old forgotten places of the world. These places only a few may recognise...away from the vile things which breed without end. 

Current release is "Nordland".
Originally a self-released Cdr, and only made available for very close acquaintances of the band, select labels and webzines, it was never made directly available to the public.
From July 2012, the album saw official release by Glorious North Productions.

"Nordland" was followed up by "The True Cult of the Earth" (2013) and "Songs of Regression" (2015)

2: Nordland was a swiss synth wave band (1985 - ) consisting of Priska Weber, Mario Scherrer and Anna Kellenberger. They released a self-titled 4 Track EP in 1986, the single "Just keep it away" in 1987 and their first full length Album "Mistery" in 1989, followed by "Three Clouds" (1993) which was recorded in their new domicile in Italy.
Today the founding members Priska Weber and Mario Scherrer live in the swiss country side and sometimes perform under the name "Ingalill". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nordland">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
