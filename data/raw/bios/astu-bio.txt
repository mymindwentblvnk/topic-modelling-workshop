ASTU is an Eritrean R&B/soul singer-songwriter from Oakland, CA, U.S. Part retro soul, part nineties R&B pastiche, part New Wave-inspired synth-pop, ASTU’s music refuses to pledge allegiance to a single vibe. ASTU is a recent recipient of the Zoo Labs Music Residency Program.

The Oakland-based singer/songwriter has the ability to find an easy, irresistible groove and turn it into a unhurried banger. The depth and complexity of her buttery alto on Patterns, her debut project, has garnered critical acclaim from Afropunk, Earmilk, KQED and more. From silky, slow jams to trip-hop-esque grooves, ASTU keeps us wanting more.

Variance Magazine describes her sound as "...kin to some of Solange’s recent material with the whispering confidence of Kelela..." while KQED raves, "...a particularly insightful and self-assured debut, sure to count as one of the Bay Area's most notable releases this year." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/astu">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
