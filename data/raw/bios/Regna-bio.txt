Regna is a progressive rock band from Barcelona. The band started when a group of young musicians decided to play old-school music that wasn't fashionable around the musical scene. The result was a sound that goes from the energic sound of Riverside or the early Dream Theater, to the classic style of Camel, Genesis or Spock's Beard.

Their first release, the EP Meridian, is a conceptual suite divided into four acts in which instrumental episodes are intersperse, and it has been very well received by the national and international specialised press. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Regna">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
