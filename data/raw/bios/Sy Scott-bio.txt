If you don't know u better ask somebody about Sy Scott.  This gifted Emcee is set to leave an impression on Rap music.  Scott's lyrical dexterity and versatility automatically places him amongst the elite in the game.  His substantial lyrical content transcends the realm of average rappers, and his signature "Sychotic" style puts him in a class of his own.

Rapping became a necessity rather than a desire for Scott who found the craft to be his outlet.  The troubled adolescent ran away from home nearly twelve times before age fifteen.  Having witnessed the success of NAS, 50CENT and other rappers closer to his age, a young ambitious Sy Scott began to consider his lyrical inclination and prolific writing as a means to sustain his livelihood.  

Scott linked up with Dallas Austin's Atlanta based Rowdy Records in 2005 coming off a short stint of touring and writing for Erick Sermon's EPMD and Death Squad. With an industry buzz and an international following, Sy Scott managed to land a recording session in Dallas Austin's DARP studios. Just as Scott was leaving his session, Austin pulled in speakers ablaze with Scott's record. Moved by what he heard, Dallas expressed his desire to sign an artist like the one he was bumpin.  Rowdy's artist, Novel, and Former President, Dave Gates, agreed.  Scott was signed and the rest is history in the making.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sy+Scott">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
