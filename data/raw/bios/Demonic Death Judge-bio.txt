Demonic Death Judge is a sludge metal band from Kotka, Finland. 

The project formed in 2009, and the band has since released two EP's, "Demonic Death Judge" and "Kneel". The first album "The Descent" was released in 2011, and the second album "Skygods" followed soon in 2012. The band has gathered rave reviews from critics, and they have played killer shows with Shrinebuilder, Red Fang, and Entombed to name a few. Two original members, the identical Hakuli brothers left the band in 2013, so Toni Raukola and Eetu Lahtinen from the band Burweed stepped in to bring the ruckus.
