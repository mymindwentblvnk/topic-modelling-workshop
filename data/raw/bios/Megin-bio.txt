Megin was formed in 2005 by Tommy "Reinxeed' Johansson and Svante Karlsson. The band started in Lycksele, North Sweden when Tommy and Svante met each other at a gig. Svante went on to the stage after the show and growled In Flames' Bullet Ride and Tommy liked his cover and asked him to work together to combine their vocal styles.
The band used to be called TS and then Abandoned but their last name before they split was Megin, which is the old Norse word for magic.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Megin">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
