The Beautiful Girls are an Australian band from the New South Wales coast composed of Mat McHugh on vocals and guitar, Paulie B on bass and Bruce Braybrooke on drums.

TBG have released five full length albums: Learn Yourself, We're Already Gone, Ziggurats, Spooks and Dancehall Days; as well as one EP, Morning Sun, TBG have an eclectic style of their own, with smatterings of rock, acoustic, reggae, pop and folk all through their music. Many people find elements of artists such as Ben Harper, Jack Johnson and The Police, but their most recent album Spooks has, among others, Bob Marley influences. 

TBG have been nominated for Best Music Video: I Thought About You, at the Inside Film Awards 2007; Best Blues & Roots Album at the ARIA Music Awards of 2005 
And for the J Award 2005 

They have also made it into the Triple J Hottest 100 four times: twice in 2003 at #41 ("Blackbird") and #62 ("Music") and twice again in 2005 at #68 ("...And We'll Dance on the Ashes of What's Left") and #81 ("Let's Take the Long Way Home").
