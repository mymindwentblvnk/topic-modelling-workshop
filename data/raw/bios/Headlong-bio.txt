Headlong are a London-based rock band who are rapidly growing in and around the London modern rock music scene, who have built a repertoire of vibrant, powerful, feel-good original songs, based around infectious hooks and a wry sense of humour, which have gained recognition from established artists and businesses in the music industry.

The band dates back to when Matthew Hart and Tom Monks, at just 16 years old, started jamming together around May 2012 as a hobby to pass time during their GCSE study leave. Once they realised the possible potential of their songs, they started to take themselves more seriously and began to work on establishing themselves as an act, recruiting Matt's brother Jonathan Hart on bass.

Along the way they have amassed over 10,000 listens via their YouTube and SoundCloud pages and have performed at some of London's hottest venues, including 93 Feet East, the Dublin Castle and the O2 Academy, as well as attracting attention from several independent and even major record labels.

Taking inspiration from acts such as Oasis, Foo Fighters, New Radicals and The Verve, Headlong focus on writing upbeat, feel-good, appealing songs, combined with the authenticity of rock music - ranging from borderline-satirical ballads to furious walls of sound.
