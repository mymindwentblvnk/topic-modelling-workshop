Behind Once There Was is Jessica Bj√∂rklund Lehto (Sweden), who started adventuring music by playing the piano back in her childhood. Later on she grew to enjoy singing. An interest in writing and recording her own music was found when exploring her brother's home studio, and at the age of 17 she was hooked.

Once There Was goes back to 2002, when Jessica wanted a project name for her first release. It started as a power metal project but the genre has varies throughout the years. Six releases have so far happened since 2002, the latest being "Breathe, Be, Bleed" (2019) that has been described as electro pop opera.
