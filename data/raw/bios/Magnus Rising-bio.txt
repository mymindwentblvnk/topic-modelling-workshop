In April 2002, guitarist Roger Cranford posted a call for musicians seeking to start a band in St. John’s, Newfoundland, Canada. Bassist Matt Snow and vocalist Aaron Hawkins responded to the call and a jam session was scheduled at Memorial University’s Music School Choral Hall. The chemistry was unexpectedly good and Magnus Rising was immediately formed. Drummers have come and gone, but the core lineup has remained intact since that original, fortuitous meeting.

From 2002 to 2006, Magnus Rising wrote, performed, and recorded original music before audiences across the province of Newfoundland. Battling adversity, including the loss of $20,000 worth of musical equipment in a fire at their rehearsal space in 2004, Magnus Rising developed their craft and earned their reputation as a first-rate live rock act. During that five year period, Magnus Rising performed over 100 gigs and released their first EP, Magnus Rising, in 2005.

After testing the waters with a performance before record executives at the Hard Rock café in Montreal, Magnus Rising relocated in June of 2006 to Vancouver, BC. Within a year, they had begun recording their first major studio album, Counting the Numbers, at the Factory Studios. Counting was produced by Doug Mix and released independently in December, 2007. Plans for a 2008 cross-Canadian summer tour are presently underway. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Magnus+Rising">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
