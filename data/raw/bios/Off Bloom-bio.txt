Connections and collaboration seem to be driving forces in the music industry right now, and no stranger to either of those concepts is new trio off bloom, who hang out with the likes of MÃ˜ in their homeland of Denmark and make magic in the studio with AlunaGeorge and Two Inch Punch. All of that aside, off bloom has a unique artistic identity that translates into some really strong pop, and their debut track, "Orchid", is a hard-hitting, intricately created track that will definitely leave a lasting impression on you. It's a resounding mix of punching bass, choir-like vocals, and electronic adornments that seem to have become a staple in music today. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Off+Bloom">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
