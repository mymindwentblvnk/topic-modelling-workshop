TDOHM formed in 2004 in Newport South Wales, UK.  They would now be considered a Cardiff band and consist of members Darren Kaskie (Guitar, vocals, piano, synth and loop pedals) Ian Charles (Drums) Alex Morgan (Bass 2008 - present), Nicky Williams (Bass 2004 - 2008). 

"TDOHM have been building up to this for a long time. Years of endless shows and some impressive records have appeared up to this point but honestly, this is possibly their best material yet." - Ninehertz review for "White Light"  - October 2013. 


"Slowly crawling into the dawn, the latest material from the trio has seen them refract from their original soundpool, bringing to the fore the shoegaze and British darkwave/gothic influences that had always been buried in the crushing, drugged riffage. The vocals, rather than barked, act almost as a fourth instrument; their lament creating ethereal tendrils of sound that coruscate through the classic precision pounding that has become the trios calling card. Even in these precision attacks something has markedly changed, elevating mournful melody above the crunch, that together with the vocals, create the same enveloping aura of their most acclaimed recordings. Perhaps one of the only bands left in the country making this sound their own, The Death of Her Money have shorn themselves of damaging preconceptions to create a more panoramic view of heavy music that now feels insulting to just label metal."

 - David McLean Fat Out Till You Pass Out/Tombed Visions Records 2013.
