The entire search took 2 weeks, finding it easier Ilnur - drummer of group "Grim Grave", agrees to play before the emergence of a permanent drummer. But with time he joined in the team, becoming integral part of the project. Later in the group included musicians such as Constantine, Andrew, playing in "Akxumoron", Lena and Ramil.
