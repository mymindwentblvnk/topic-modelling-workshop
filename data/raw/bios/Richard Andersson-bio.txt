Richard Andersson is a keyboardist who was born in Ystad, Sweden, March 28, 1972. As a child he seemed to enjoy classical music such as Bach, Vivaldi, Mozart etc. He tried to learn music the traditional way, but lost interest due to the strict and non-improvisational aspect of the lessons. At the age of 7 Richard already was capable to play some advance classical stuff just by listen to the music. Organ and Keyboard became Richards's biggest interest. Improvisation was his trademark.

When he was 15 years old, he created his own special style with influences from masters such as Jens Johansson, Yngwie Malmsteen, Jimi Hendrix. Solo playing was the one and only way for him to express his feelings in a satisfying way. Early in his career he liked to compose his own music. A bunch of demos with songs played by a keyboard player with fire in his fingers are probably a prove that Richard is one of the most interesting keyboard players in the world right now.
