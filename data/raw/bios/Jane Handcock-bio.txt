Oakland, California R&B songwriter Jane Handcock steps out from behind the scenes to release her Raphael Saadiq presented debut project Truth Be Told.

Handcock has worked with many big names in the music business, including Kelly Rowland, Tyrese, Tank, Big KRIT, Keke Palmer, Kehlani and more, plus producers Teddy Riley, Justice League, Harmony Samuels, James Fauntleroy, 1500 or Nothin and Polow tha Don, as well as with close friend and writing partner Adrian Marcel. It was at OSA (Oakland School for the Arts) where she met fellow classmate Marcel as well as Kehlani.

While working on Adrian Marcel’s debut project 7 Days of Weak, Handcock had the opportunity to collaborate with Grammy Award winning singer, songwriter, producer Raphael Saadiq. It was then that things began to take off for her. Saadiq was impressed with her vivid confessional lyricism. He was intrigued by her ability to not only write honest music that touched people but the very special ability to empathize. He said her level of empathy made the songs she writes for others even that more dope, “she’s like a musical medium.”

Her collaborations with Saadiq and Marcel led Handcock to vocal produce Marcel’s breakout hit “2 AM.” Now, Handcock begins to emerge as an artist herself, and Truth Be Told immediately shows why some of the all time greats are so eager to work with this rising star.
