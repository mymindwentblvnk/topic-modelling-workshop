Biography:
2009
It all started in April/May, when Iiris Kosonen wanted to form a band. She asked Miikka for second guitarist, and Iiro Kosonen for drums, but Iiro decided to ask Tomi instead to become the drummer. Their bassist supposed to be Lauri, but due to his military service, he didn't come, so Iiro became the bassist temporarily.

After some time and jamming together, they needed a singer. Miikka happened to know Jarno, a musician from Uusikaupunki (a small town 70 kilometers away from Turku), so he asked him to become the vocalist. After singing some Six Feet Under and other stuff for them, Jarno officially became a bandmember. Jarno was also the one, who came up with the name for the band, Siknis.

2010
On January, they performed first time live on Turku Bandstand, and it was shortly followed another gig on February. At the same time, it was confirmed that Lauri will join the band. Lauri performed first time with Siknis on Turku Bandstand semifinals held in March.

On July, Iiris was replaced by their live guitarist Niilas, who had been substituting Iiris since May.

On October, the band has stopped existing. They never performed with their official line-up (always someone was substituting someone). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Siknis">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
