Forged in Auckland, New Zealand during the Winter of 2005 under the name DESECRATE by brothers, Autumus (Nathan Baylis) and Arzryth (Aaron Baylis).

 In late 2005 Nekasarof (Dean Ramanauskas) was recruited as Vocalist and had suggested the band be renamed WINTER DELUGE, therefore it was. Shortly after followed the recruitment of Destragus (Tommy Gibson) on Bass as well as Incinerus (Phil Kingham) on Rhythm Guitars.

 In 2006 the 4 track EP "VEHEMENT VISIONS OF NIHILISM" was recorded during the first week of October at the old rehearsal lounge by Sam Sheppard. The EP was released at the "Black Metal and Blasphemy" show in Wellington City
 on the 13th of October 2006.

 A following was formed and more shows we're being played around NZ...

 In early 2008 Incinerus departed from the band followed by Nekasarof which left the band as a 3 piece with the odd false members who would come and go.

 In late 2008 Arzryth had met Grant Dover (Exastheras) who had impressed him with his musicianship so he was recruited as the 2nd Guitarist.

 In Early 2009 Hildolfr (Alex Mayo-Smith) was recruited as Vocalist allowing the band to begin playing live shows more frequently again.

 In January 2011 WINTER DELUGE went into the studio to record the debut album 
 "AS THE EARTH FADES INTO OBSCURITY" resulting in 9 tracks/48mins of Pure Chaos.

 Prior to the release Hildolfr left the band and after a 3 year absence, the return of Nekasarof was announced bringing WINTER DELUGE back to its Traditional Roots.

 The debut album was released on the 21st of January 2012 and the band is currently working towards the 2nd album which will cast much more hatred and spiritual possession than the debut.

 ...Winter Deluge represents Nature's Revenge on the ignorant and disgraceful critters who don't deserve to inhabit this realm.
