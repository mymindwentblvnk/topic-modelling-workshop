The band was formed int he mid 90's and were initially a covers band, But there was a lot of talent and energy blinded with a hunger to be a creative force within the music industry, The Cd Ritual Spirit is not completely on the web yet but i have probably the only known remaining copy and will consider the release of it after discussions with former band members! The band were fronted by Marcus Bossano the singer with a real powerful voice akin to paul rogers (Free) and able to produce great vocals live or in the studio. Then there was the Bassist Dave Edwards who is a talented musician and a perfectionist to say the least. Guitarist Simon Elliot was the young gun in the band and a very creative and interesting mate, And Finally myself Terry mccoy the wanna be John Bonham of the band! 
Basically we were a group of guys from cardiff, Wales whom really enjoyed playing for a living, unfortunately we split up around 98-99 and went our seperate ways as a result of indifferences, however you never know whats around the corner so watch this space ?  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ritual+Spirit">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
