John Tardy (born March 15, 1968) is an American vocalist who is best known for his work with the death metal band Obituary.

Tardy worked for a computer company from 1997 to 2002 after Obituary split up and was generally regarded as one of the main reasons Obituary split up.

He is often noted for his interesting and unusual use of his voice. Whereas most death metal singers (and singers in general) always sing lyrics, he often does not. Instead, he uses his voice to fit the music, not focusing on what he is singing about.

Donald Tardy (born January 28, 1970) is the drummer of influential death metal band Obituary and the brother of John Tardy, who is the lead singer of the band.

Donald also played drums for Andrew W.K. on the album Party Hard. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tardy+Brothers">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
