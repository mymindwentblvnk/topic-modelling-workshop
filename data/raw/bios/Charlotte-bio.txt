4) Charlotte is a german indie band from Bamberg/Frankonia.
With their first fee M.Monaco, Eddie Herkules und Max bought a candyfloss machine. But as music business is not eating candy they surely kept on practising.
Never having played an instrument difficulties were preassigned. But with the ambition to make girls go crazy, they finally began to observe and to study the performances of other bands.
They call themselves „Charlotte“ with good reason: girl names are more attractive - „Charlotte“ sounds good and is above all the ex girlfriend. 
Their musicial style has also a special term -„Dreiakkordsport“: A headstrong, but unmistakable mixture out of beat, punk und rock’n’roll, combined with naughty lyrics. The songs are about lovesickness, drugs and bad elvis imitators and are as unspent as just like a refreshing tissue.  
The future belongs to Charlotte! Even if the name belongs to the former girlfriend.
