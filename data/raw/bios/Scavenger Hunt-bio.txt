Los Angeles is a city brimming with opportunity. When Philadelphia native and established music composer/producer Dan Mufson moved to LA in 2011, he quickly realized that in this city, creative minds often meet at unexpected moments. Every name and every phone number increases the odds of achieving a goal, or helping someone along the way. Dan likened the process to a scavenger hunt. When he first heard the enchanting voice of Jill Lamoureux -- herself a Wichita, Kansas transplant -- he knew collaboration was imminent. The very next day the two worked together composing a track for a commercial. The multi-instrumentalist producer and vocalist enjoyed the writing process so much they decided to form Scavenger Hunt.

For Dan and Jill, the hunt led them to one another. The duo turned 4 piece band are forging an exciting, dreamy electro-pop sound that is attracting listeners on both coasts. Less than 48 hours after releasing their debut single "Lost" it was played on University Of Pennsylvania's WXPN. Since then, the track has received blog acceptance by Pigeons and Planes, Indie Shuffle, The Burning Ear and Neon Gold. They are embarking on their first tour this spring supporting Capital Cities and are releasing their debut EP in early April.
