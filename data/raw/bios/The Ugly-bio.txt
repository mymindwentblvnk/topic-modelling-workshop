There are two bands called The Ugly:

1.  An obscure '77 punk band from Toronto, Canada.  They're (un)known for releasing the single 'Stranded in the Laneway (of Love) b/w To Have Some Fun' on Explosion records (1978). 

2 THE UGLY was formed in late 2004 in Stockholm, Sweden by Ingemar Gustafson and Johan Eriksson as a black/thrash metal act. They were soon joined by Peter Jonsson and they recorded one demo in 2005 (The Birth), without even having a drummer. An old friend, Lars Sundström, soon joined to play guitars. With the first demo out, drummer Henrik Östensson (Genocrush Ferox, Hate Patrol) was recruited.

Things progressed slowly, and in 2006 Lars was replaced by Per Rinaldo, and a second demo was recorded (Diggin’ Graves). The first gig took place in january, 2007 in Borlänge, as an opening act for Napalm Death. During the follwing year, a few more gigs followed.

Plans to record a debut album grew, and the band started to focus more on black metal, and abandonded their early thrashier sound. In late 2007, the band was offered a record deal with Dental Records, and in May 2008, they entered the legendary Necromorbus Studio to begin the recording of their debut album "Slaves to the Decay". 

In November 2008, Slaves to the Decay was released, and given much praise in reviews. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Ugly">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
