3) Also a 1970s UK rock band, who released at least one album, "Misunderstood", which finally made it to CD in 2009. Strider was a great little band," says drummer Tony Brock from his home in LA. "We were a regular at the Marquee in London, selling out just about every time we played there."

In the annals of Rock history this little known band from London's thickly crowded club scene were an all to brief footnote. A charming lot, they played an excellent brand of hard-rock blues in league with Status Quo, Deep Purple, Humble Pie and Free. Their legacy post-Strider far out lived their feeble existence as a band and it is only through shear determination we have resurrected them for this piece.

5) Electronic artist from Canada (aka Contra etc) who has released on GOD Rekidz, D-Trash records etc 

6) A Finnish true metal band, who released their debut album Dominion of Steel in 2019.
