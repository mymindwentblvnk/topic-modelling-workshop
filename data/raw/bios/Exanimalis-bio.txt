Founded in 2009 in Graz, Austria by Pyrphorus, Matzurbation and Lukas, Exanimalis started as a Rock/Metal Band. Soon, Eva and Kankras joined, and the Band changed its genre to Death Metal. Due to musical differences, Lukas soon quit the band. Fortunately, Paul was found to support the band. The band had their first Concert on the 06.11.09 in Graz, followed by several other Concerts, and already played in other big cities, including Vienna and Klagenfurt.
