Janosch is the name of the music which Jesper Marcussen makes with the help of the people around him. Janosch was originally a duo formed back in 1997 with guitarist Jacob LÃ¦by, and before Jacob left the project the two members recorded the Inhere Outthere EP together. Janosch was founded on an idea of creating and recording simple melodies in a simple way, the dreamy and gentle Janosch way.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Janosch">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
