There are multiple bands with this name.

1. Exhibit 'A' formed in late 1978 when four 14-year-olds discovered a shared interest in John Peel's late night radio shows â€” whilst avoiding sporting activities together during school breaks. They produced three issues of a fanzine, Wombat Weekly, and recorded their first EP, No Elephants this Side of Watford Gap at a central London youth club in 1979. At age 15 and 16 they were thought to be the youngest band to release their own record independently. Their second EP followed two months later, but Exhibit 'A' split by 1981. Six further tracks on three collections on the Dead Hedgehog label completed their official catalogue. Guitarist Paul Platypus also played with the Reflections (with Mark Perry and Nag from the Door & the Window) and Twelve Cubic Feet (joined by former Exhibits drummer Andrew Lunchbox and bassist Matthew Matrices among others), and founded Namedrop Records and Cubic Music publishing. Matthew carried on in Solid Space (1981-).
