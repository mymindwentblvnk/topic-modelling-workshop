Gossamer//Skeleton Zoo//faust ghoul//Tristan Allen

As a kid, growing up in Scarborough, a suburb of Toronto, Nue used to rap on tracks for his older brother, Sauceboy, when he was getting into beat-making. He is still Nue’s consistent collaborator with tracks on Playground.

Nue’s first couple of singles in 2017 (“Obvious” and “Alaska”) he posted on YouTube and Spotify, then released his first mixtape, Iroquois. “Nightfall” came in the spring of 2018. All the accolades and press led to some opportunities to ghost write on some big tracks, music placements in Call of Duty, and a tour with Fetty Wap.

He used to draw, loves weed and tequila, and skateboarding and snowboarding. Anything more personal, you can learn from his songs, emotion-based from personal relationships and experiences. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nue">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
