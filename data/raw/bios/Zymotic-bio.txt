Johan Willems, is the one man composer behind the musical act "Zymotic”. Johan describes his style of music as “progressive electronic fusion” because he had to invent his own style of creating sounds when a disease (CMT) made playing his instrument of choice at the time (the guitar) no longer possible. Every since he was a child music was his passion, which he had to give up for many years until he discovered electronic music; the medium in which he could then and now, express himself. He calls his music "progressive, electronic, fusion" which is very true but also understating the many genres of music his compositions could be tagged as. He is a genius that can express pure, unadulterated emotion and weave subjectively esoteric, magical portals where one can escape to and dare to be moved.
Because of his innate talent and single minded perseverance no matter what, Johan's full length album “Zymotic part one” was released in 2012 by Alaska Swimming Gear and currently “Zymotic part two, Body & Soul” is available through Bandcamp. You can find the video for his new single “When you find the right door.” at

The preface to the video hints at more than merely a man who creates music; he is a rarity and his music, pure magic.
In Johan's words...
“Sometimes your life feels like you sink deeper and deeper into a swamp. 
You can't get out of it alone. But then someone gives you a helping hand. And it feels like magic. They give you new insights and feelings. Nothing is a coincidence. 
Dreams that come true, voices you hear, sounds you hear, shadows, but there is nothing. And yet 
I had no fear because I had an angel with me, close by my side. Sometimes she stays, sometimes she goes, but I hope she stays with me.”
