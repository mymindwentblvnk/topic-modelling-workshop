Magistrates strive to their own brand of pop harking to the ambience of Caister 
Soul Weekenders and Southend blues parties. The wealth of their influences flip 
flops from soul and disco to Chicago house and krautrock, for these records 
they’d be set to flog their three swords. 
What began as a way to alleviate the boredom of existing in a small English town 
has become Magistrates. The band have joined the fleet of Essex musicians 
fuelled by aspirations far greater than the expectations of their peers to 
create records which could barely be traced to the place of their conception.
Upon formation the band released a demo titled ‘Make This Work’ on their own 
imprint of XL recordings, which quickly caught the attention of the likes of 
Damon Albarn & Zane Lowe. They have made their rounds on NME tours and festivals 
across Europe. While the boys were lapping up the energy of it all the band were 
set to tease fans by biding their time before promises of releasing an album.
Since then there have been rumours of a first record but this year is to be the 
year. Magistrates' offering comes from a converted cowshed where they have been 
recording.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Magistrates">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
