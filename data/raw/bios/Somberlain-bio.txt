Somberlain is a death metal band from Brazil.

In the beginning of 2002, with the idea of talk about morbid themes related to antichristianism and human evolution, Delano Lima created Somberlain. To express these themes musically, Delano decided to mix technic and aggressivity through an authentic death metal.

Soon after the creation of Somberlain, Marco joined the band and in june of the same year they entered in studio to record a demo with four songs, titled "Awakening in the Darkness". For the recordings they invited Bruno César (drums) and Luciano Abreu (guitars - R.I.P.).

In 2004, the band recorded their second demo, "Humanity's Funeral", and after some changes the line-up was Delano Lima (bass), Fabrício Carvalho (guitars), Yuri Leite (guitars), Marco Aurélio (vocals) and Bruno Gabai (drums). In August 2006, guitarist Yuri Leite left the band and Diego Lucena (also from Ark of Sin) joined Somberlain to fill the line-up, recording solos for the first album.

In the promotion of both demos, Somberlain made concerts in lots cities of Brazil, playing with known metal bands like Cannibal Corpse, Incantation and Krisiun.

Actually Somberlain is recording their debut which will bring 10 tracks with a killer production and will show the band's aggressivity and technic.

Delano Lima: Bass
