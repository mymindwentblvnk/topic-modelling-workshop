This rock band from Roznava, Slovakia started as being called "Exit". After members returned from  military services (which was obligatory that time), they found out that such band plays in Hungary (where they wanted to play too) so they changed the name. They started their work under the name SEXIT in 1990. They released 5 albums: SEXIT (1992), Vtak z Atlantiku (1996), Prima Energia (2003), Tvoja Tvar (2005), Ne add fel (2009).
In 2009 Štefan Hundža (lead vocals, bass) announced his end of performing in the band. Other members of the band decided to use the same band name also without him.
