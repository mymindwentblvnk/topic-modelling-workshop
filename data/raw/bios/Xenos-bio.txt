There are a few groups that go by the name Xenos:

1. Xenos is an Italian üáÆüáπ thrash metal band formed in 2019 by Ignazio Nicastro (Bass/Vocals), Danilo Ficicchia (Drums) and Giuseppe Taormina (Guitars).
They released their debut full length album ‚ÄòFilthgrinder‚Äô in 2020.  The band is dedicated to a pure form of Thrash Metal, clearly inspired by Megadeth, Xentrix, Annihilator and Slayer without forgetting a strong dose of personality in every single composition. 
Guitar riffs cutting like razors played by the ultra talented guitarist Giuseppe Taormina, killer solos, a hammering and devastating drums by Danilo Ficicchia (Eversin) a pulsing boneshaking bass and a vitriol voice is what you will have listening to XENOS.
‚ÄúFilthgrinder‚Äù is a 100%  Thrash Metal album born from the urge to go back to the roots of the genre and inspired to the more technical wing of Thrash Metal of nineties. Pushed by the love for Megadeth, Xentrix, Annihilator and Slayer, ‚ÄúFilthgrinder‚Äù wants to exalt the characteristics of the genre through fast and aggressive compositions, yet at the same time, technical and  full of groove.
No compromises, no fashions, no bullshits, just Thrash metal at all.
