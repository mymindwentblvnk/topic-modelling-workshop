BIO
I, Acedia' is Synergic Ire's debut album that features nearly 30 minutes of music revolving around confusion, insomnia, frustration, apathy, and impulsive thought.

Derek Michael Burgess and James "Cody" Walker began Synergic Ire as a project to explore the depths of their musical expression with no limits on a specific gernes or sub-genres. Naturally voicing their passion through (mostly) abrasive music, the duo's only missions are to create energetic/passionate music, to appease interested fans, and perform their music for as many fans as possible. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Synergic+Ire">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
