Self Defense Family (sometimes shortened to Self Defense and previously known as End of a Year) is a post-punk outfit with members from across the United States and England, origin Cohoes, New York, United States.

The band started in 2003 as a side project for a number of Albany musicians already involved in full-time bands. Having spent time in heavier bands, the initial End of a Year line-up was interested in trying something more overtly melodic. Taking their name from an Embrace song, the band's original sound was highly influenced by the Revolution Summer-era DC bands.

Try Me is the fourth studio album an first  under this moniker - previous studio albums were released under the name End of a Year. The album was released on January 2014 through Deathwish Inc, though they have released various EP's and splits with Run for Cover Records.
