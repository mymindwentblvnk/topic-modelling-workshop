Ewan Pearson has been making records for a living since 1998. He has recorded as Maas for Soma, releasing six singles and an album, ‘Latitude’, and under a number of other guises including World of Apples and, currently, Partial Arts for Cologne's legendary Kompakt label. His remixes for the likes of Depeche Mode, Chemical Brothers, Seelenluft, Cortney Tidwell and Freeform 5 have made him one of dance music’s most respected producers and have been compiled on 'Small Change' (Soma, 2001) and last year's !K7 2CD retrospective 'Piece Work'. He has programmed for Goldfrapp and Gwen Stefani and his production credits include Tracey Thorn's acclaimed solo album 'Out Of The Woods', The Rapture's 'Pieces of the People We Love' and M83's latest 'Saturdays=Youth'.

A published academic at the tender age of 27 ('Discographies: dance music, culture and the politics of sound' (Routledge, 1999) with Jeremy Gilbert), Ewan writes a regular column for Germany's 'Groove' magazine and his 'Enthusiasm' blogs send readers hot-footed to record stores in their droves.

As a DJ Ewan's no slouch either. Two CDs - SciFiHiFi Vol.1 for Soma and July 2007's fabric 35 were both nominated for Plug awards, and his 2006 Resident Advisor Podcast was voted best of that year by the website's readers. A regular at clubs from Privilege to the Pulp to Panoramabar, his sets - like the rest of his career - defy easy categorisation, marrying the independent and the underground with a pop sensibility that's all his own.

Currently Ewan is working on the debut album from Australian indie hopefuls Lost Valentinos, new Partial Arts material, remixes for Hot Chip and Foals and the next solo record from Tracey Thorn.
