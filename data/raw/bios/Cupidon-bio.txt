Cupidon AKA LV Cupidon is a French Canadian rapper of Irish descent stemming from the Sud-Ouest arrondissement of Montreal (Pointe-St-Charles).
He started gaining attraction as a teenager in the early 2010s with then-acolyte Slicky for songs including "Mon Temps C'est de L'argent" and "Sans Stress" on YouTube.

In 2013 he was arrested in Granby, Quebec on a robbery charge and weapons possession with a few associates.

In September 2018 while on permission from jail he made his comeback on the local rap scene with the release of the "J'vois en double" video on Youtube.
He was released from Donnacona federal penitentiary in April of 2019 and immediately got back in the game with the release of La Zone on all platforms.

He kept releasing singles all throughout 2019 and 2020, notably "West Side", "Vie de Criminel", "Up Next" and "Man Down (featuring Lebza Khey)", all leading to the release of his first album "Up Next" on 11 September 2021.

Around 2020 he rebranded the LV moniker (originally for Loyalty & Vision) to Les Vikings, rap group consisting of Joey G & Boutot (FKA French Gang), Lebza Khey and himself.

On 14 May 2021 he released the collaborative EP "Les Trois Étoiles" with DawaMafia and Yung Duce on iconic Quebec rap label Rico Rich Productions.

On 25 November 2021, after months of harassment by local police forces, including the illegal raid and thrashing of Les Vikings store in Granby, he released his first studio album "Non Coupable" with support from Higher Reign Music Group. The album was supported by singles "J'les remercie", "Du Clout", "Gang Way", "Mon allié", "Métal (featuring Lebza Khey)" and "Drip".
