Dirge Eternal was formed in 2008, as a result of a desire to create something different. Finnish metal scene seemed to overflow with new-wave trash metal bands etc. J. Perta's life-long passion for horror stories and melodic, variable music drove him to seek other guys sharing a similar passion. Other members were found pretty easily and writing for killer tracks began. Members' various backgrounds and musical variety were discovered as a strenght from the very beginning and interesting songs started to form. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dirge+Eternal">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
