F.B.I. were a UK-based outfit, much in the same vein as Average White Band and Kokomo, with maybe a slightly more raw and edgy feel to their range. Boasting a male and female lead, the nine-piece were clearly destined for bigger and better things. But alas, this solitary album from 1976 is the only fruits of this carnation of the band. However, although cruelly neglected in its day, coctail of funk, rhythm and blues, calypso, reggae and soul that you might just fall in love with.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/F.B.I.">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
