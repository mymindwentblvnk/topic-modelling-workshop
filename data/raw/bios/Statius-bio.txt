Statius Formed in the fall of 2007 by four musically driven teenagers. All hailing from different cities in the San Fernando Valley, they all shared a genuine passion for Heavy Metal. With a goal of combining peak elements of Heavy Metal genres such as American Thrash metal and European Melodic metal they set out to build a unique sound crossing speed, heaviness, and aggression with melody and technicality. Picking up influence from many bands such as Death, Testament, King Diamond, Megadeth, and Kalmah. Statius has recorded 2 demos within less than a year of formation, the 2 demos entitled “Statius” recorded in 2007, and “A Night to Remember” recorded in 2008. With plenty of dedication, material, and perseverance, Statius is ready for anything.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Statius">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
