Sedated Angel plays psykedelic garagerock with lots of energy and lots of fuzz, wah and delay. The music has suprising original changes, up-tempo riffs and psychedelic “loose it” parts that will blow your mind and leave you thirsty for more.

Sedated Angel was formed in 2005 in a basement in Kolding, Denmark.
They all had dreamt about meeting someone with the same approach to life who wanted to create and play music, full time.
Everybody believed that “this could prove to become great”, and already  half a year later, Sedated Angel went in to the studio and created their first EP "Sedated Angel".

In 2008, Sedated Angel were ready to to release their first full length album, "See The World Through Burning Red Eyes". The album was  recorded in"Outhouse Studio". The album was released on both vinyl and CD. The band released the album themselves at Waterpunk Productions and it was distributed through Danish stores and at concerts. At the same time Sedated Angel started to collaborate with their close friend and VJ, Nicolai Niemann when playing live. Nicolai had previously been graphic designer at the Sedated Angel EP.

After a year with touring around Denmark, and Germany, Sedated Angel found themselves ready to record yet another album. 
With the newly gained experince from the tour, and after an inspirational trip, Sedated Angel once again entered the door to "Outhouse studio. Three weeks of intense work and the album "Far Beyond Repair" was  done. The album was released on the 6th of February 2010 and it received a stream of glowing reviews.
