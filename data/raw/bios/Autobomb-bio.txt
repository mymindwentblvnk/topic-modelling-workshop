Autobomb was a thrash metal band formed in San Diego, CA in 2004. The original lineup consisted of Cyrus Ghahremani, Tony Montemarano, Brian Rumsey, David Price, and Andy Paul.

On October 14, 2005, The band released the March of Death EP, their debut studio album, featuring 7 of the band's most well-received live tracks. This was soon after the destruction of New Orleans by Hurricane Katrina - consequently, the band donated proceeds from the albums' sales to the New Orleans Restoration Fund.

During their years active, Autobomb played with such acts as Andrew W. K., Avenged Sevenfold, Thrice, Atreyu, Saosin, Guttermouth, and the Vans Warped Tour, exposing guitar-oriented thrash metal to a more mainstream audience.

In 2006, the band split up. Montemarano and Rumsey continued work in Mursic, Price and Paul focused on school, and Ghahremani began producing solo material.

Though there were repeated announcements of Ghahremani's plans to continue playing the music live (and in a different direction, with local punk band Roadside Affair as his backing band), this has not came to fruition and the project remains on hiatus. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Autobomb">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
