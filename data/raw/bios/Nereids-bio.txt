Nereids is a Symphonic and Baroque Metal band. Nereids draws its energy from saturated sounds energized by a powerful and incisive rhythm, a symphonic orchestration full of harmonies. The lyrical female voice with its baroque style gives the songs a timeless light, the breath of life to infinite horizons.

  From this unexpected sounds alliance, Nereids founds its inspiration.

  "We want, above all, communicate our energy with the people, resonate."

  Nereids is actually an acronym for Neural Evolution Retrieving Emotions Inside Deep Sounds. This is the basis of a secret experiment that was intended to condition the people through music, according to the principle of subliminal messages. But this secret experiment was stopped. The group use this name to remember that music is authentic, and is the only divine way that leads to the hearts of those who share it.

  In april 2012, Nereids performs a live show at the PPM Fest at Mons (Belgium). At this time, the band announces the coming of Caroline, as violonist. In october 2013, Alexis joins the band as the bass player, and in august 2014, Geraldine becomes the official singer of Nereids.

  In may 2014, the band enter in studio for its first album recording. The themes of the first album are energy, nature, harmonies of universal forces. This first album tells, within songs, the equilibrium between the Light World and the Shadows Forces.
