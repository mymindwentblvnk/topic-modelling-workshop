Cydocore (www.myspace.com/cydocore) was formed in october 2006 in Croatia.The previous band was called Dissobey but we had to change the name because of some problems with a band from germany who had the same name:). The first lineup of Dissobey was: KaRlo on solo guitar, Kreso on rhythm guitar, jOkA on drums, Frco on vocals and ..una on bass! In the short time of our existence we changed our style of playing and the type of bands we covered pretty much but it's always about extreme and hardcore metal. As Dissobey we played on our first concert which took place on 31.3.2007. We would like to express our gratitude to our two friends - Max for his vocals on the concert and Sale for his bassmaniac playing!! We are now working on our songs and trying to arrange as many live shows as possible. We played with bands like Skepsis +,Corpse Grinder,Cold Snap,Gregzeye,Moltencore,Seed Of Evil,Chained in Agony,Path of Survival,No More Idols,Limit 0,Deadweight loss... <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cydocore">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
