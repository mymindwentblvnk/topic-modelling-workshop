Nérija are a collective of London based musicians playing exciting and original music. Consisting of Sheila Maurice-Grey on trumpet, Rosie Turton on trombone, Cassie Kinoshi on alto sax, Nubya Garcia on tenor sax, Shirley Tetteh on guitar, Inga Eichler on double bass and Lizy Exell on drums, Nérija have toured across Europe in such places as Norway and Germany, and have played alongside top UK jazz musicians such as Nathaniel Facey of Empirical and Zoe Rahman. 

Meeting through a Tomorrow's Warriors Development program, Nérija began from an initiative created to specifically address the imbalance in the number of women achieving success in the music industry. Recent performances include UK festivals Love Supreme, Latitude, Brainchild, Manchester Jazz Festival and Jazz Re:Fest. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/N%C3%89RIJA">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
