Breathinâ€™ God was formed in February 2004 in Isernia by five musicians already involved in other musical projects. The monicker was Underworld, though, and the line-up was made up of Alessio Szachowky (vocals), Fabiano Teo Falcione e Giuseppe D'Agostino (guitars), Alfonso Cifolelli (bass guitar) and Luigi De Luca (drums). After few months Giuseppe D'Agostino left the band and he was substituted by Nicola Pirraglia. In the 2005 Nicola Pirraglia left the band because of University and was promptly replaced by Simone Sferra.
After a lot of live shows in Isernia, the whole band moved to Rome and chose a harder sound, without losing its melodic side: moreover, the singer Filippo Palma, able to perform scream and growl and already frontman of Lunarsea, joined the band and added the rough groove they had been looking for. Once the current formation was completed, Breathin' God entered Giuseppe Orlando's (Novembre's drummer) recording studios (The Outer Sound Studios). The help of Orlando was consistent and led the band to the release of its first EP: Crossing The Human Mind. 
Breathin' God is currently working at their first actual album.
