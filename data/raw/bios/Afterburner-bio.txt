Afterburner refers to two artists. 

1) Afterburner is a side-project of Joey Cape (Lagwagon / Bad Astronaut) and Todd Capps (Bad Astronaut).

To date they have released four songs through their Myspace, which can be purchased from the band directly. 

The band plans to release more songs in the near future.

2) In 1996 the rock band Afterburner was founded in Osterholz-Scharmbeck (near Bremen). They take songs from the 60ies, 70ies, 80ies and the "Neue Deutsche Welle" ('New German Wave') and give them the Afterburner flavor.

Their songs "Wir sind Werder Bremen" (based on The Monkees' 'Daydream Believer') and "Deutscher Meister SVW" are not only on the official "Lebenslang Grün-Weiß" CD of the german football club Werder Bremen, but they are also played regularly at home matches of Werder.
