Isobel Anderson is a British singer-songwriter and sound artist. Originally from East Sussex in England, Anderson is currently based in Belfast.

Her music combines soulful rich vocals with delicate guitar accompanyment on some tracks and rhythmical energetic guitar on others. She has released a self titled E.P. in 2008 and in 2010 released her first album "Cold Water Songs". 

Her sound installation work combines voice, processing and visual elements to create immersive audience experiences often exploring our idea of place, memory and identity. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Isobel+Anderson">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
