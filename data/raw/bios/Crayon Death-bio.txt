Crayon Death, the six piece heavy metal juggernaut from Pittsburgh, PA, is widely regarded as one of the most overlooked bands of their era.  Formed in 1993 and disbanded in 1999, Crayon Death released two full length albums and one live album. They shared the stage with acts such as Suicidal Tendencies, Hatebreed, System of a Down, Morbid Angel and Karma To Burn.  Guitar riff driven rhythyms punctuated with a two vocalist attack considered by many to have influenced an entire generation of imitators. 

The members consisted of: Alan, Patrick Mullen "Spam" (Lead Guitar), Andy Krise (Bass), Dave Hummel (Vocals), Scott, John, Marconi (Drums), and Mike Stains (Rhythm Guitar).
