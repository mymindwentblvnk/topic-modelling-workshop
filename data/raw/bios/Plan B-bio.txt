There are several artists and bands with this name:

1) Plan B (real name Ben Drew, b. 1983) is a rapper from Forest Gate, London. From the age of 11 he attended Anglo European School in Ingatestone Essex, before transfering to Tom Hood, an inner-city comprehensive. He has described his character, in these school days, as "a bit of a cunt". He is signed to 679 Recordings, home to UK rap act The Streets. His unique sound is characterised by his use of acoustic beats and lyrics involving drugs, rape, murder and underage sex. He was placed fourth in the BBC's "Sound of 2006" competition.

His second album was released in April 2010; The Defamation of Strickland Banks was released on 12 April 2010. The album is a departure from the sound heard on Plan B's debut album Who Needs Actions When You Got Words, with the rapper's sophomore effort showcasing much more of his singing ability. Lyrically the album's songs tell the fictitious tale of one Strickland Banks, a sharp-suited British soul singer who finds fame with bitter-sweet love songs like the album's opener "Love Goes Down", but then loses everything when he ends up in prison for a crime he didn't commit.

The album was a great success, reaching #1 in the UK album charts, and three singles from the album reached the top 20 of the UK singles charts, with 'Stay Too Long' reaching #9 and 'She Said' reaching #3.

The Ill Manors Songfacts reports that on March 23, 2012 Plan B released “Ill Manors,” the title track of the soundtrack to the British film of the same title, which he wrote and directed.

2) Plan B (real name James van Leuven) is a producer/musician from Seattle, WA. On Like a Ship Sailing, Plan B's James van Leuven steps beyond his drumming for Automaton and allows percussion to be the focus. Laying a foundation of trip-hop beats, van Leuven (who handles nearly all of the instrumentation) implements sampling and crawly guitars and bass. The record possesses the darker atmospheres of trip-hop but without the accompanying vocals. There's also a spy film aura that permeates much of the album. Sometimes it gets a little too dark with the disturbing line, "Howard just said he was going to blow his brains out next Tuesday." It's balanced by a child asking, "Have you ever been in love?," in "Love," which flirts with breakbeats. "Come out Strong" has a finger-snapping cool jazz vibe with trumpet from Bill Jones. This project might be "plan B" for van Leuven, but his great job with live percussion makes it grade-A post-rock.

After the release of 2 LPs in 2002 and 2006 + 1 EP in 2003, Plan B Seattle was over-shadowed by the pop success of the british Plan B Ben Drew in 2006.  Since then Plan B Seattle has stopped releasing music under this moniker.
