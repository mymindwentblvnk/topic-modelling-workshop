Shishamo (stylised as SHISHAMO) is a 3-piece Japanese rock band. Formed in 2010 while at high school in Kawasaki, Kanagawa, the band began releasing music in 2012. 

Asako Miyazaki (Gt&Vo), Aya Matsumoto (Ba) and Misaki Yoshikawa (Dr) formed the 3-piece band “SHISHAMO” when they were in high school rock band club in Kawasaki. They started writing songs when they were sophomores in high school. During their senior year of high shool, they won the first prize and the best vocal prize at the concert that they decided to get involved to test their musical skills.
During their high school days, the three girls got to release a self-produced CD, went on a national tour, and hosted a radio show “All Night Nippon R”, experiencing many things that normal high school students don’t get to do. After receiving a moderate amount of attention among core audiences in various parts of Japan, “SHISHAMO” finally made their national debut!

Right after they graduated from high school in March, “SHISHAMO” locked themselves in a recording studio for 3 months to create their new self-titled album. The new album titled “SHISHAMO” comes with a blast of 11 songs that are filled with various emotions, haunting melodies, catchy lyrics and relatable hooks. 

Bassist Aya Matsumoto left the band in 2014, Aya Matsuoka becoming the band's new bassist.
