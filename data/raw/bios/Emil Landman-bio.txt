Emil Landman (born in 1989 in Amsterdam) is a Dutch folk musician, based in Utrecht. He graduated from the Herman Brood Academy. Landman released his debut EP "A Bargain Between Beggars" in February 2013. His debut album, Colours and Their Things, was produced by Martijn Groeneveld and released on 3 October 2014 through V2 Records. The album debuted at number 44 on the Dutch Albums Chart.

Landman graduated from the Herman Brood Academy based in Utrecht. As a solo artist, Landman is humble, but those who have heard him play now know, that it’s only a matter of time before he will join the bigger names. The lyrics are pure, personal, yet universal and the melodies are incredibly catchy without being “pop”. A fragile, warm voice with a touch of languor through which the truth of his core resounds. The guitar playing, contemporary and inventive. With his music Landman takes you to a place where you sit at your tiny kitchen table, staring out the old window and you realize that everything is fine, just like it is.

The first songs are recorded and Landman contacts the New York based artist Larry D Brown (Grey Reverend). Together they decide to work on Landman’s existing material, this merged with later written work form his debut EP “A Bargain Between Beggars”.
