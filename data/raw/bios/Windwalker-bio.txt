Windwalker was a Swedish epic black metal band in the Bathory vein. The band did their first live show at a local music festival in Gävle. As they didn’t have a name yet they went into a video store and found the movie „Windwalker”. As they thought they would only use the name once they decided to stick with it but they stayed together as a band under that monicker. In 1997 they released their one and only album through the Swedish label VOD (Voice Of Death) Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Windwalker">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
