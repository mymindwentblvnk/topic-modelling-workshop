June 24th marks the release of the brand new EP, Sensory Overload, from Nor Cal’s APOTHESARY. This young band, average age 21, started making music as 14-year-old friends blending their influences into something they could call their own. Instead of just hanging out in the garage and dreaming about the possibilities, these teens started releasing independent CDs and touring the country on DIY-booked tours spreading their name by playing shows with Killswitch Engage, Dark Tranquillity, Fear Factory, Dying Fetus, Helloween, Suffocation, Warbringer and As I Lay Dying and networking with no fear in summer breaks between school.
Now 7 years later, this is no boy-band, and Apothesary are ready to join the bigger leagues. Having the solid, original core of guitarist vocalist Jared Eandi, drummer Gregg O’Neil and guitar player Clayton Cagle (also of Bay Area thrashers Hatchet) along with new bassist Brittany Shankle, the quartet will hit the road again this summer, including dates opening for American Head Charge, Motograter and Psycroptic, on their first agent-booked tour. In combination comes the new EP, showcasing a continued maturity as they blend new and old-school death metal influences to concoct something brutal, melodic and adventurous all in one. This EP will be released on M-Theory Audio, the indie, underground imprint from Marco Barbieri, formerly of Century Media, Metal Blade and currently running Salem Rose Music Mgmt and Publishing Co.

The band formed in June 2009. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Apothesary">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
