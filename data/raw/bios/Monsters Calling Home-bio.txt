Monsters Calling Home is a project by Alex Hwang and raised currently in the San Fernando Valley. Inspired by stories of immigrant families and the wildly appropriate 90’s children tv show “Ah! Real Monsters,” MCH aims to share the comedy.mystery.irony.tragedy of monsters calling jip. Daniel.Joe.John.Sally.Jennifer are smanging musicians graciously sharing their talents for this leg. It began as Ralf.Jay.Justin.Jackie.Alice.Daniel @ the HOB 9.7.10. Gangster Folk Oriental. Jesus.

In December 2012 Monsters Calling Home changed their band name to Run River North. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Monsters+Calling+Home">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
