It is claimed that the genesis of his unique imagination of sound is based on an inborn malfunction inside his left ear.
Immediately after his birth, this defect was surgically removed and the doctors advised his parents to strengthen his sense of hearing by musical stimulation. Hannes attended a music school and discovered his own vision of rhythm. His older siblings took great care to educate him with good sense of music appreciation.
At the age of seven he listened attentively to the sound of electronic dance music from Berlin's „Love-Parade“ broadcasted by a German radio station.
All these influences in his early childhood development  led him to start creating his own music. Using his free time to work on new productions and DJ-Sets since the age of 12, a  4/4 earworm of rhythm beats in his head and appears to accompany him in every moment of his life. 
Elegance, deepness, lightness, individuality and perfection are the five major elements which describe his music best. Travel brought him to Reykjavik. There he discovered a new,  sixth element to add into his musical perfectionism: experimental sounds.
Time, taste in music and love changes with every song written and played. But  his love of music remains his greatest inspiration. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hannes+Smith">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
