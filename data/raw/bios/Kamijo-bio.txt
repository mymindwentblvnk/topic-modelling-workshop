KAMIJO is a well-known vocalist, composer, lyricist, and producer in the visual-kei scene in Japan. He was born on July 19th, 1975. Having been in the industry since 1994, KAMIJO is particularly famous for his incredibly flowery and garish aesthetic, as well as for being a passionate Gallophile. His two most successful projects, LAREINE and VERSAILLES, both used elaborate costumes and had a heavy classical influence in their music.

Kamijo first formed Lareine in November of 1994 with guitarist Mayu, whom he met as roadie for Malice Mizer. Together, along with bassist Emiru, Lareine became a successful visual-kei act of the late 1990's, bewitching audiences with their romantic and frilly performances. The height of their career was in the year 2000, a time when the band was signed to Sony Music Entertainment Japan and released their second album フィエルテの海と共に消ゆ～THE LAST OF ROMANCE～ (FIERTE no Umi to Tomo ni Kiyu). Unfortunately, shortly after this release Emiru announced his departure from the band, followed by subsequent secessions from Mayu and drummer Machi. From that point until 2001, Lareine acted as a solo project for KAMIJO, and released the two albums Scream and Vampire Scream.

In 2002, KAMIJO joined the band New Sodmy with Mayu. Although this project was a change of style for KAMIJO, changing to a more of a soft, straightforward, rock sound as opposed to the more symphonic and whimsical style of Lareine, the band only lasted about a year before breaking up.

In 2003, both Mayu and Emiru rejoined Lareine and the band revived. After a few more releases, and another two drummer changes, Lareine ultimately disbanded in 2007 after Mayu started to become unreliable with attendance for live shows. Their last concert was in 2006, with Hizaki filling in as their guest guitarist.

2007 also marked the year that KAMIJO and HIZAKI formed the band Versailles. Like his other projects, Versailles was French themed and played on the themes of eternal life, vampirism, and a love of all things rosy. Unlike Lareine, this band was a symphonic / neoclassical metal group and had a much more steady lineup. After only two releases, the band blew up in popularity and became signed with the European label CLJ and did shows in both Europe and North America. After 2 years of activity, the band got signed to Warner Japan and became one of the most successful visual-kei acts of the decade. The band remained with Warner until 2012: it was then that the band went on an indefinite hiatus from lack of a clear direction.

In 2013, it was announced that Kamijo would embark on a solo project. Support members were not announced until after the title of his first single, Louis ～艶血のラヴィアンローズ～ (Enketsu no LA VIE EN ROSE), was declared. Like his past bands, Kamijo's solo project retains an overall French theme and continues the vampiric storyline set up by Versailles. However, this story was meant to be supplementary to Versailles', rather than a continuation, and is Kamijo's attempt to 'rewrite history.' 

KAMIJO's first single was released on August 28th, 2013. It came in 3 types: two of which had DVDs, and the regular edition contained an extra bonus track and instrumental versions of each song. The music video for the title track also featured a cameo by fellow visual-kei musician Mana, of Malice Mizer and Moi Dix Mois. Having been a roadie for Mana back in the 90's, as well as taking considerable influence from his projects, many fans were both shocked and delighted to see them working together. It was later revealed that Mana had no part in the single's composition, but rather had helped in 'reviving an aesthetic' both he and KAMIJO enjoyed.

On March 5th, 2014, KAMIJO released his first mini album entitled Symphony of the Vampire. This also marked his return to the record label Warner Japan, and would be his first large release as a solo artist. The mini album contained 7 songs that flowed into each other, creating a cohesive piece of music that was to be digested, as its name implies, like a symphony. The album also contained music videos for each and every track, telling the story of a young French prince who was granted eternal life by becoming a vampire. Similar to his first single, this mini album came in 4 different types: two editions came with the music videos (one as a DVD, the other a Blu-ray), and the third with an instrumental bonus disc containing songs KAMIJO had written for the movie Vampire Stories. 

Soon after the release of Symphony of the Vampire, KAMIJO announced he would embark on his first consecutive single campaign for the summer of 2014, releasing the single Moulin Rouge in June, and 闇夜のライオン (Yamiyo no LION) in July. These two singles, as well as his first single, led up to his first album, HEART, which is set to release in September of 2014.

In addition to KAMIJO's extensive music career, he has also owned and ran two record labels. His first formed in the year 2000, after all of the members of Lareine left the band, called APPLAUSE RECORDS. Through this label, Kamijo released several indie albums and singles for Lareine in addition to producing and supporting bands such as IZABEL VAROSA, 神崎, ＲＩＢＢＯＮ, and collaborating with record label UNDER CODE PRODUCTION for the omnibus Anamorphosis. APPLAUSE RECORDS ceased activities in 2006.

In 2007, KAMIJO's other record label was created--Sherow Artist Society. This label housed two very success bands' early careers: Versailles and 摩天楼オペラ. Both of these bands have toured overseas and are currently signed with major record deals. Other artists signed to Sherow at some point include: Juka, Metis Gretel, ドーリスマリィ, -The- UnForGiveness, ルシア and Hizaki Grace Project. 2010 marked the year both Versailles and 摩天楼オペラ left the label due to getting signed to international record deals, as well as the year all of this label's activities stopped (as none of the other groups signed to it were still active). This label remained dormant until 2014, in which Kamijo announced he has signed a new band and became their producer: [MU:].

Sherow Artist Society also had a short lived super group entitled Node of Scherzo. This group was made up of KAMIJO, Kaya, and Juka as vocalists; HIZAKI as the guitarist, and Jasmine You as the bassist (the 2nd guitar and drums were played by the rest of Versailles as support members). This band's music told a story about the battle of light and darkness, and even featured a spot from Asagi (of D). Node of Scherzo only released 1 official song, while playing songs also playing songs from each member's solo projects. 

In addition to producing and performing, KAMIJO has also written music for the movie Vampire Stories (as mentioned earlier). He has also performed guest vocals in an album for 哀旋士.
