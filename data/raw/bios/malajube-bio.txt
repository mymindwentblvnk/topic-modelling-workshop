Malajube are an indie rock band from Montréal, Québec, Canada. They sing in French and have three albums out on Dare to Care Records. 

The group made itself known in 2004 with the release of its first album, "Le Compte Complet." Critics welcomed the disc with positive reviews, which allowed the group to become instantly famous in the Québécois music scene. Several of its songs, such as "Le Métronome" and "La Valérie," were prominent mainstays on several Québec radio stations. For the production of the album, the group turned to Martin Pelland from fellow Montreal band The Dears.

In the months that followed the release of their first album, Malajube launched a tour across Québec, participating in several major festivals, such as Les FrancoFolies de Montréal.

In February 2006, the quartet released its sophomore album, Trompe-l’œil, which also received a warm welcome on the part of Québec media. Collaborations with singer Pierre Lapointe, Québecois rap group Loco Locass, and the use of a wide variety of instruments has contributed to the album's success. Trompe-l'œil also began to attract attention in English Canada in July, when it was shortlisted for the inaugural Polaris Music Prize, and in the United States in October, when it was a featured review on Pitchfork Media. In 2006, they won three Félix Award at the 28th edition of the Gala de l'ADISQ: two for Trompe-l’œil, "Best alternative album" and "Best cover art" while they were proclaimed "Revelation of the year 2006".

Their third album, Labyrinthes, was released on February 10th 2009.

Their song "Montreal -40° C" was featured in a Rogers Wireless commercial, and Ton Plat Favori was in a Zellers commercial. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Malajube">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
