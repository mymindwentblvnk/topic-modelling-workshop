In From The Cold is formed in the beginning of 2007...The founding (and the only true) members are Jimi Triple B (Hang, Drawbacks)& Count Boris (Hang, Through Art)...
Jimi always wanted to have a band like that, in 1999 he jammed "the gambler" song with a couple of friends, but nothing serious came out of that.... About 8 years later he wrote a couple of more songs and invited Boris for a few beers and a jam session...It worked out great...The "Ghostsongs" album coming soon...  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/In+From+The+Cold">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
