After having played in great venues with a few famous names such as Gojira, Dagoba, Textures, Zuul FX, 100demons, Lofofora, Inside Conflict, Eths, Punish yourself, Kickback and produced a few demos, the quintet decided to record its first album called Worst Times of Decline in 2002.  The album was balanced with melodical content as well as intense violence controlled with mastery. Relieved from hardcores influences, H-Tray delivers today with Distressing Report a genre of music that crosses metals boundaries and gets the audience unanimous. Worried about the quality of their work and the visual aspect of their shows, the members of the band kept their identity while staying in touch with the evolution of the metal scene. This second major album (Distressing Report), recorded in one of the best studios in France ( Christian Carvin / All prod studio ), and more than 400 concerts in France made of H-Tray one of the most promissing french metal bands these days.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/H-Tray">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
