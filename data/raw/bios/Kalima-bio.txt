Formed in 1980, Factory Records avant-funk band Swamp Children initially shared members with A Certain Ratio before mutating into acclaimed latin jazz contenders Kalima, releasing four albums between 1986 and 2002.

Their music is a mixture of torch songs, latin jazz and bossa nova with Ann Quigley's vocals added. Their back catalog has been re-issued on LTM Records.

Drummer Dave Higgins went on to record as Stick Manoeuvres for Here And Now Recordings. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kalima">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
