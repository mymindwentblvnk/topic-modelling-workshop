War Ripper formed in 2007 in Portland, Oregon and is currently active on Hells Headbangers Records.  They released an EP in 2007 titled Hellstorm.  The line-up behind War Ripper may consist of Joel Grind and Yosuke of Nuclear War Now!.  Not much is known about the band except that it is a "secret" side project of Toxic Holocaust.  Music consists of thrash, black metal, crust with somewhat of a tributary reverence towards Hellhammer, steamed up on d-beat with lyrical content such as the bleak aftermath of a nuclear holocaust and other dystopian imagery.  This style is known as "Satanicrust."  They were supposed to release a split with Evil Army through Hells Headbangers, but the status of the release is unknown.  It was possibly cancelled. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/War+Ripper">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
