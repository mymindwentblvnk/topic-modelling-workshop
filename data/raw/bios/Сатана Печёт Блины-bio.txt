The group was formed July 6, 2009, as a response to questions that nobody asked. The name (Сатана Печёт Блины: "Satan Bakes Pancakes") was given in honor of their violent neighbor, whose hatred of the art and loud music is intertwined with an unstoppable love for cooking. After the band members posted a few tracks on the Internet, it became clear that such works were able to be something familiar and alluring, not only to the musicians themselves, but also to a considerable number of internet users, which inspired the artists to engage seriously in music and continue to share their songs with the world.
