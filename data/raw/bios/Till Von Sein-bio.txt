Despite his young age and his different activities Till von Sein is been involved into music for a while. He spent his youth on a skateboard, rapping in several bands and combos and was totally into the whole hip-hop culture before he started to Dj at the age of 21. As a rapper he made himself a name in the north part of Germany and managed to do important shows with some of the well known people from that scene at that time but this didn’t satisfied him and so he started to focus more into DJ’ing which became his true love! To stand on stage by himself and play the music he loves, that was the real and only way to express himself, whether some straight techno/house records or even dropping some rap classics or even play a rock tune in a middle of his sets which became typical and built his reputation as a true music lover!

Till started to produce music in 2003. In 2005 he teamed up with Aera who he knew for more than 10 years from their skateboarding and hip-hop activities. They released their very first record called “Angel of the A7” on the label Trenton records in May 2006, followed by a track on the Various Trenton 015 called “people like us” alongside with Format B, p.toile and Daniel.fx and will put out a new EP on the same label in February 2007. This first release revealed Till and Aera’s musical genre as a mix in between funky house and old school Detroit’s music with a touch of tech house electro… Right after this first 12” they got support from people like Laurent Garnier, Luciano, Dirt Crew or Sasse that were very enthusiastic to hear such of a funky groove in these minimal days!!!

Till von Sein also started to produce on his own and will soon release a full length EP on the French label Bodytalk… Look out! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Till+Von+Sein">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
