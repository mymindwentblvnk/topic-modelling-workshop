As the "succeed in your job" generation rotates in a preordained orbit, we receive signals from a star reminding us of the poetry of the glow dying down. Hamburg three-piece Me Succeeds combine everything the idea of youth promises: euphoria and recklessness, but equally melancholy and the courae to doubt.
Borders between musical genres don't need to be crossed anymore, since they have been eliminated long ago. Back when they first met in the outskirts of Munich in 2002 already, Lorin Strohm and Sebastian Kokus combined guitars and synths, intricate melodies and particulate loops. Shortly afterwards, they were joined by Mona Steinwidder and her crystal clear voice, along with a range of analogue instruments.
Since the band members moved to Hamburg in 2004, their sound has certainly been influenced by the city's musical school, but nevertheless the constriction of suburbia still emanates from their songs. Me Succeeds draw musical sketches of their overflowing hearts; sketches which -just at the right moment- turn their back to inwardness and become extremely straightforward. They then come up with slogans that would lose all credibility if they were uttered by someone beyond 30: "We Are The Screws Holding It Together!"
Me Succeeds create an atmosphere of discreet sportiness. They play their own game - a game that doesn't yield to the constraint imposed by categorisation, but merely obeys to the inspiration of its art. They have appropriated Pavement's intelligence, The Van Pelts' powerful sprechgesang and Turner's dancable songwriting. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Me+Succeeds">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
