Scientist is a name of at least two acts:

[[b]1] A pseudonym of dub musician Hopeton Brown (aka Overton Brown),  from Kingston, Jamaica).  Brown burst onto the reggae scene in the early '70s with a reckless mixing style that seemed to outdo even King Tubby's wildest extravaganzas. He began his career as an engineer at Tubby's in 1978. Shortly afterwards he became a Tubby protégé and, by 1980, had gained a reputation with a distinctive mixing style.

He became worldwide known after Rockstar Games used his album 'Scientist Rids the World of the Curse Of the Vampires' in 2001.
