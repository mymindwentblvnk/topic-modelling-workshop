The Avalanches are an electronic music collective from Melbourne, Australia. They are well known for their use of eclectic sampling, having created their debut album, Since I Left You (2000), entirely out of over 3,500 samples of obscure records, movies, and television shows. This is famously demonstrated on their hit single "Frontier Psychiatrist".

Before this, they were a hip-hop group with the single album Rock City and the EPy El Producto.  After a 16 year hiatus, they released their sophomore album Wildflower (2016), which was followed by We Will Always Love You (2020).
