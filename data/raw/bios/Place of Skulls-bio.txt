New band by Death Row founder and ex-Pentagram guitarist/songwriter Victor Griffin. He has reunited with original Death Row bassist Lee Abney and Tim Tomaselli on drums. Extremely solid traditional Doom-metal that will most definitely appeal to fans of both Victor Griffin's earlier bands. After Spirit Caravan broke up, Doom legend Wino (also ex-The Obsessed and ex-St. Vitus) briefly joined Place of Skulls before forming The Hidden Hand. Later Dennis of Revelation and ex-Oversoul also joined the lineup.

"Shortly after releasing "As a Dog Returns" in 2010, Victor rejoined Pentagram for a two-year album & tour stint. Upon departing Pentagram, he founded a new project, Victor Griffin's In-Graved." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Place+Of+Skulls">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
