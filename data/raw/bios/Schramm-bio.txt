Since the late 90-s, Robert Meyer and Ringo Behn have been out and about non-stop regarding all things music – as solo artists and doing project work with other artist from the EBM, Metal or Punk genre. 
Back in 2006, to expand their musical foundations, they founded SCHRAMM. They combine Synths, E-drums and a laptop with unusual outfits to present an unorthodox live performance – hard beats, crazy sounds and cynical lyrics all included. SCHRAMM are successful in bridging the genres…whether you’re into old-school EBM, Punk, Electro or Noise, there’s something for you. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Schramm">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
