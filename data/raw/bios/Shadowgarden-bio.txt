Shadowgarden was formed by Andreas Hinden√§s and Johan Ericsson, they had been playing together for about 12 years in different bands with different styles. The big connector was the band Draconian where they started playing for more than fun. Right now they are working on a release with lots of different styles and elements. Describing their music would be to say that they play gothic metal-rock with some serious catchy choruses. After playing mainly in a studio enviroment for this release they also involved Jerry Torstensson, the drummer of Draconian, to participate in the songs and the result turned out very good. Another addition was the singer Lisa, also she in Draconian, that really added another dimension to the songs. Shadowgarden released their demo in 2007, right now they are looking for a label to release their latest tunes and are in contact with some record companies.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Shadowgarden">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
