Formed in 2013 by guitarist Ross Dolan, vocalist Laura Dolan, bassist Nick Vogelpohl and drummer Nate Wagner Electric Citizen from Cincinnati, OH have had a busy year turning heads and ears onto their dark and esoteric style of haunting and unhallowed ’60s West Coast rock, and decidedly British-influenced heavy psychedelia.

Like records by similarly late 60s/early ’70s-possessed anti-modernists Blood Ceremony, Wolf People and Uncle Acid and the Deadbeats, their debut album "Sateen" provides a blueprint for long term appreciation. Recorded and produced by fellow Grammy Winning Ohioan and local stalwart Brian Olive (The Greenhornes, Soledad Brothers) the album draws on sounds synonymous with the roots of early ’70s proto-metal from groups such as Sir Lord Baltimore, Pentagram, and the daemonic spirit of Amon Düül. Not to mention the comparisons it draws with the rock 'n' roll ceremony of forgotten acts like Frumpy and Shocking Blue when held up against the spellbinding light of high priestess Laura Dolan’s enigmatic voice and live presence.

Electric Citizen has been featured on VICE’s Noisey, Premier Guitar, Classic Rock Magazine, MetalHammer, Thrasher, Roadburn, CVLT Nation, Decibel Magazine, Trasworld Skateboarding, ArtRocker Magazine, AtlSounds, and more.
