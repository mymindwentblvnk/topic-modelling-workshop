Heavily rooted in anti-Judeo-Christianity, Slavonic paganism, and hatred, Dub Buk (from Kharkiv, Ukraine) has existed in some form or another since 1997.  Boasting fellow countrymen Nokturnal Mortum's Istukan on guitars, Dub Buk plays relentless melodic black metal.

In their early days, the sound was rawer and more "pure" black metal, but on the album Idu Na Vy!, the band took a more symphonic and epic approach, adding bombastic keyboards to their music, but still keeping their traditional black metal style for the most part. On the Album Rus Ponad Vse! more Thrash Metal influences became part of the music. The style of the band developped also in a more experimental direction. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dub+Buk">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
