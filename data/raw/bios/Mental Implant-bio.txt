Mental Implant was formed in 2008 in Ankara by Tankut Aydınlıyım (Nettlethrone) and Can Sürmen (ex-Enterprise). The band immediately started rehersals after Görkem Aksaray (One More Lie) picked up the lead guitars and Cem Köse (Nettlethrone) took the bass duties.

"Handsel", the first promo song of the band was offered to the audience, as the work for other songs continued. Meanwhile, due to his busy schedule, Görkem Aksaray left the band, luckily Görkem Turan was there for probably the quickest replacement ever.

After settling down the line-up once again, the band started recording their debut EP "Zenith", at Mars Productions. 6 songs combining various elements of metal music are beneath the stunning cover art by Ozan Yıldırım. So, ready to join us on our way to Zenith?  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mental+Implant">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
