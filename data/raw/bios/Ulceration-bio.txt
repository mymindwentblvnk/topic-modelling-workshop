Ulceration was formed in July 2002. The original line up was Kevin (vocals), John Lecher (guitar),Dan Kutsche (bass), and Ryan Robb (drums). The members have played in several different local death metal and grindcore bands through out the last 10 years and were looking to acheive a unique sound and diversity that was rarely displayed in the Wisconsin death metal scene. In October 2003, Dan Kutsche left the band due to personal problems. Kris Renner was recruited as a replacement in early 2004. Shortly thereafter, Ulceration headed to Asylum Studio in Milwaukee on May 1 to record their debut release entitled "Submerged in Gluttony", a 5 song mini CD released on Bizzare Leprous productions in the fall of 2004. Shortly after the recording of the CD, Ulceration signed with Unmatched Brutality Records for the debut full-length CD due out in late 2005. The band is now busy writing new material for the upcoming CD. The music will be much sicker and much faster than the previous recording. In September 2005, John Lecher left Ulceration due to other commitments. He has since been replaced by former Deeds of Flesh guitarist Aaron Gustafson. Ulceration is back on track and currently working on a follow up to the well recieved Submerged in Gluttony cd. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ulceration">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
