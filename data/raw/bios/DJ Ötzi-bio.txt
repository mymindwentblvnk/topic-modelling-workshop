He started as a DJ and animator in Tyrol, in 1999 he had his breakthrough with his hit single "Anton aus Tirol", since then his songs are often played on so-called apres-ski and Ballermann-parties.

There is also an American deathrock-band "Ötzi" (https://otzi.bandcamp.com/), the scrobbles of which all get connected to this profile for some reason (needs to be fixed). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/DJ+%C3%96tzi">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
