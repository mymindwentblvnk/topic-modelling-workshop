Legendary heavy metal in the NWOBHM vein from Denmark. Witch Cross only released one album, "Fit for Fight", and a single, "Are You There"; they then vanished off the face of the earth, as is the case with many NWOBHM bands.

However, Witch Cross has a loyal cult following.
The members of Witch Cross reunited in 2011.
