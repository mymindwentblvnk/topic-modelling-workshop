Ever since its formation in 2004, Dutch heavy metal band Calibern has been pushing old school 80s heavy metal to new heights. Boundaries are constantly expanded by combining modern influences, such as Kamelot, Wolf, Opeth and Nevermore, with classics like Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Saxon, Crimson Glory, and many more. The result? Powerful vocals & pounding basses, well developed guitar riffs and solos, swinging drumbeats, and an energetic, recognizable live sound. For this reason Calibern has built an enthusiastic army of fans within the Netherlands, frequently playing at venues such as 013, Baroeg, The Little Devil, Koornbeurs, and more. Calibern proudly shared the bill with Roadkill, Double Diamond (BE), Intense (UK), and Ruffians (USA).

Calibern released their first official CD "Insane" in 2007, featuring a seven song epic excursion full of exciting adventures and tranquil reflections. A new CD is planned for 2009. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Calibern">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
