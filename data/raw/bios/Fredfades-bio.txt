Mention the name Fredfades in any record store with some serious soul and jazz sections, and chances are the owner will respond: "Oh yeah, I know that guy!". The scarily dedicated Norwegian record collector, DJ and music producer has spent over half his young life making speakers bleed one way or another.

Operating under the Touchdown moniker, Fred is a purveyor of rare boogie and leg-jerking electronic modern soul gems through his never-ending series of mixes and club nights. In addition to his prolific collecting and DJing, he's thoroughly been making his name as a producer in Hip-Hop circles as well.

Dense layers of samples from hard to find records, crisp drums and ruthless bass lines are the main ingredients of his signature sound. From his early cult-status beat tapes with the Oslo SP Ensemble, to his latest LP releases on labels like King Underground (UK) and Jakarta Records (GR), Fades remains ever-evolving and never-compromised. His lush soundscapes are a treat for anyone who loves jazzy Rhodes, soulful grooves and 80s synthesizer-nerdery.

Fredfades' latest collaborative efforts with rapper Ivan Ave and trumpeter Kristoffer Eikrem are instant Oslo classics. Collabs with the likes of Guilty Simpson, MED and Illa J make him a name to watch on the international scene. In other words, we haven't heard the last from this young producer with an old soul. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fredfades">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
