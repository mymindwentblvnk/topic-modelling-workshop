Sick of being surrounded by all the “trend bands” that have taken over the music scene, and fuelled by the demise of society, Incidium formed and set out to change the face of heavy music for good!!

Incidium are a 4-piece metal band hailing from Manchester whose current line-up, combined with the thirst and drive for success have been gigging hard since September 2009 trying to make a name for themselves!!

Drawing influences from a multitude of genres Incidium take a backbone of Melodic Death Metal and combine it with an element of hard hitting thrash and stomp with epic guitar harmonies and brutal vocals completing the aural assault!!

With a passion for energetic live performances and intricate yet brutal song structures Incidium have gone from strength to strength winning the 2009 Whittles BotB’s competition and reaching the Semi-Finals of several others, including the Metal to the Masses Battle for Bloodstock. A recent 3 track Promo CD (Oct '10) has resulted in the band achieving internet radio play and the start of a loyal fan base forming which, along with the live shows, Incidium plan to continue their rise to the forefront of modern metal!!

Incidium plan to start recording their debut album, for release in 2011, and to continue gigging relentlessly spreading the word and sounds of Incidium far and wide!!

You can download High Quality versions of our songs from http://incidium.bandcamp.com/
