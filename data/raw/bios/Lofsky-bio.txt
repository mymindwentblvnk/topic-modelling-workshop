Lofsky is an independent artist and producer from the Greater Toronto Area.

He has been featured on HotNewHipHop, Elevator, Canadian Dope, and supported by Pigeons & Planes, EARMILK, COLORSXSTUDIOS, Fools Gold Records and more.   While music has always been a part of Lofsky’s life, the son of an internationally-recognized jazz guitarist, Lorne Lofsky didn’t take music seriously until 2017 with the release of his EP, 27 Club, which popped off on Soundcloud after getting reposted by XXXTENTACION.

This past December, Lofsky dropped, Trust Nobody, a collaboration with Chicago underground stars, LUCKI and Mick Jenkins.

Following the release of his album, Selfish, Lofsky released Work with Mick Jenkins to end the summer off strong.

Lofsky will be releasing several projects, singles, and music videos in 2020. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lofsky">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
