There is more than one artist using this name. 

1) Azad Right is an emerging emcee / producer from Venice, Los Angeles, California. 
His Quantic-produced single "Bad Energy", which was the first release in his ongoing #GetRightTuesday campaign, sums up his mission nicely, as it's "a call to action for listeners to rid themselves of bad energy, chase their dreams, not take their lives for granted and keep everything they do honest". 

2) Azad is a German rapper. He came from the kurdish part of Iran as the child of a Kurdish family of refugees. He became part of the underground hip hop scene. He joined the multicultural, radical rap-crew Asiatic Warriors (together with "D-Flame"), who rapped mainly in English, but also Turkish and German.

After the crew disbanded, Azad focused on his solo career and his crew "WARHEIT" and became the first german hardcore rapper to be successful in the german charts.

Azad is his real name and means "FREE".
