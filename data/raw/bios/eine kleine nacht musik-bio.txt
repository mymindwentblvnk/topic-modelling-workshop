A Little Night Music, or Eine Kleine Nacht Musik, is the new project of Henry Smithson, also known as Riton. Eine Kleine Nacht Musik is a blissful trip down the autobahn circa 1974, a meeting of motorik rhythm and shimmering atmospherics, of churning basslines and tripped out sitar, relentless drums and drifting synths. In the spirit of the Krautrock forefathers and their synth pioneering mothers, Modular is proud to be bringing you the self-titled Eine Kleine Nacht Musik record on July 14. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Eine+Kleine+Nacht+Musik">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
