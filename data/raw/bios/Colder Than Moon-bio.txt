Colder Than Moon is a Melodic Black Metal band from Russia formed in 2002.

It is more like a phantom, than a real band. An overwhelming part of time Colder Than Moon is a studio project.

As to music - it is a long way from middle-tempo Gothic-based rock to squall of the blast-bits which are breaking off melodic death/black. 

Lyrics are simple, though it is ambiguous, evolves from ballads and epic sagas to darkness and chaos archetypes, baring scarcity of a human nature, through an ice flame conducts the way to the abyss â€¦ <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Colder+Than+Moon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
