MALEVELLER is a new Dallas based Four-piece band that will unintentionally be branded ‘hipster-metal’ for those wanting to easily lump them with similar-style acts, such as Early Man, High On Fire, Saviours and The Sword.  Building a “word-of-mouth” following from show to show, Maleveller has steadily grown more confident and aggressive with each performance; especially the lead Guitar and Vocals.  A little bit more “evil” in the stage presence of the Bassist and Drummer would add panache, but again, this is a fresh act that is still “working things out”.

Suggestion to any new bands: Try donning masks, then no one will care about the faces the drummer makes or the lack of interest by band members.  Some bands that wear masks who are successful: Disturbed, Gwar, Hollywood Undead, The Locust, Midnight (okay, not successful, but really cool), Mudvayne and Slipknot. - OR - add some shtick or gimmick to the performance . . . Fire and pyrotechnics seem to win fans over; (google “Great White at The Station nightclub”).

The most untrue, yet coolest, part about Maleveller is that their name can be used in verb form, which is fun to try; you should too!! Two examples:
1). Malevelling - the act of Maleveller playing Maleveller songs - OR -  the act of listening to Maleveller.
2). Malevelled - the aftermath of a Maleveller performance. For example, a drunk band member could say at the end of a show “You’ve been Malevelled!!”. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Maleveller">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
