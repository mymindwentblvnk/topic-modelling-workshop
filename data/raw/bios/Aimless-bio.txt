Aimless is 21 years old. He is currently living in Northern California and pursuing a degree in physiology. He got into music at the age of 14. He started experimenting with EDM loops in GarageBand during his free time in the summer and eventually found his sound in instrumental hip hop beats a couple of years later. Over the years, making beats has become more than just a hobby for him. He's made a lot of meaningful connections and is grateful for the talent and inspiration he is surrounded by in this community. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Aimless">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
