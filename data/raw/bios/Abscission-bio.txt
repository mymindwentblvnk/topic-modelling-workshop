BIO
Fusing elements from different metal sub-genres, Abscission strives to present a unique piece of death metal. The music is expressed through up-tempo blastriffs, atmospheric dissonant downtempo parts, crying leads and shifts between time signatures. Abscission aims at the contrastful composition without compromising the death metal genre. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Abscission">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
