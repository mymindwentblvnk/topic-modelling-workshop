BIO: Cutting their respective metal teeth at the not-so-tender ages of 12 and 14, DISSONANCE in DESIGN's (formerly Morbus Deus) core members re-invented themselves and evolved into a progressive/melodic/technical metal wrecking ball. 

Siphoning inspiration from such artists as Veil of Maya, The Faceless, Protest the Hero, Between the Buried and Me, Within the Ruins, Animals as Leaders, and many others, DISSONANCE in DESIGN offers up an uncompromising amalgam of singular riffs and hypnotic grooves that will appeal to even the most discerning Metal palates. Even those not-so-familiar with the metal genre will find the music accessible, and infectious.

These young men employ an unrivaled strategy when creating their melodic mayhem: write songs that are far beyond their physical talents and capabilties, and practice/play them until they become an integral part of the DiD sonic arsenal. Technically precise execution, combined with visceral musical themes/lyrics translate to a commanding stage presence that leaves audiences transfixed... and wanting more.

Some intrinsic subject matter includes disdain for the government, self-introspection/healing, meaningful personal experiences, and the bane of worldwide religion. Some have gone so far as to label DISSONANCE in DESIGN as "Inspirational Metal"...

Ultimately, it's all about the music itself...so there will be no acquiescing to the mundane and contrived. Expect the unique...and the unexpected... <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dissonance+in+Design">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
