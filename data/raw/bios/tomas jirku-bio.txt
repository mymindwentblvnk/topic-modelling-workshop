Tomas has been making music since about 1999.
Early on he liked the rave, and made music heavy on the Luke Slater influence. He then somehow came upon Basic Channel and his music went way deep. Albums were released in Canada on labels such as No Type, Alien8 and Intr_version.
He performed at the innaugural Mutek festival, opening for Thomas Brinkmann and Triple R. From there it got drier and more West German. Tomas loves Weissebier. He did some records for Force Inc, Traum, Klang Elektronik, Revolver, Audio.NL...
A whole lot of remixes from him recently, for Nice & Nasty, Thoughtless and other friends. He's also got a little hobby label going in Rivers of Recordings. At this point he still thinks early Warp takes the cake, though you wouldn't know it from his music.
