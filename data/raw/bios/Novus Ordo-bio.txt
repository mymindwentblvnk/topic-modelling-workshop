Novus Ordo is black metal from Chile, the band was formed at 2012
Novus Ordo's style is pure cold black metal played with a furious ferocity which thematically stories a world bereft of light and mercy. Respites are few during the nine chapters with only brief bows to the darkness at hand. While At the End of the New Times tells of the end, Novus Ordo has only just begun.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Novus+Ordo">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
