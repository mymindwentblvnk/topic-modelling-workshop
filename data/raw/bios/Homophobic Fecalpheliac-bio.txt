Homophobic Fecalpheliac is the product of two of the members of The Hollowing. During a phone conversation and some joking around about making a side project, a real band was born. The duo consists of Neil Andersen on vocals and programming and Alex Ippolito on guitar, bass and programming. The group has released an EP titled Suffocation Through Intestinal Constriction in February of 2015. A full length is planned and in the process to be due out late summer.   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Homophobic+Fecalpheliac">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
