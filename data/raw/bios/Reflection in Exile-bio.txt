Reflection in Exile…A Metal quintet from North East England.

With a wide range of influences, from early death metal to modern day thrash, Reflection in Exile bring together an amalgamation of speed driven, technical drumming, riff orientated guitar work with a diminished harmonic correlation, and low “throaty” growls, balanced off against high pitched screams… The band is currently writing material that is being played in live venues all over the U.K. and on hard copy all over the world!

THE LAW OF RETALIATION EP (2011):

Their debut EP, "The Law of Retaliation" was released in early 2011 to critical acclaim and since then the band have been working hard as part of the UK underground metal scene and began their assault on the UK in Spring 2011 playing the EP material in every respectable venue possible. After gaining very positive feedback, a nationwide following and shifting hundreds of copies of the EP, the band are now concentrating on their upcoming, as yet "Untitled" album for release in 2012.

Since the release of the EP and the follow up single “Apega”, R.I.E. have gained notable exposure and prime airtime on FM and dedicated, metal Internet radio shows which have led to numerous live performances and label interest. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Reflection+In+Exile">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
