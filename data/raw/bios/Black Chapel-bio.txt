Black Chapel is a Los Angeles based Symphonic Prog Metal band. Influenced by many genres of music, not limited and never forgetting where they came from and what started them. With a solid three track demo recording the band has been able to gather respect from not only fans but other musicians as well from different styles and genres. With an open minded composition style and no limit/boundaries concept under their belt, they've figured out what drives metal fans to continue listening to the band. Black Chapel's goal is to bring you what the music industry doesn't deliver music-goers today,...quality. Giving the listener something tolerable wherever they go and driving fans with an adrenaline to go crazy during live performances by the band. Today the band books shows to begin their tour through Northern California and returning in time to open for Prog Power Metalers- Kamelot and Leaves Eyes.
