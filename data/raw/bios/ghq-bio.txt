GHQ is an improvisational trio comprised of members Marcia Bassett (Double Leopards, Hototogisu, etc.), Pete Nolan (Magik Markers, etc.), and Steve Gunn. Their sound combines the open-ended acoustic compositions of Henry Flynt with raga, drone, and other musical elements to produce a hypnotic sound that is both entrancing as it is lyrical.
