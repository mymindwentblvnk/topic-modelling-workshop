Julie Byrne is a Seattle-by-way-of-Chicago-by-way-of-Buffalo singer, songwriter & guitarist whose first album, the ethereal, "Rooms With Walls and Windows" was released in January 2014. Blending psychedelic & traditional folk elements, Julie creates a highly personal & quietly mystical world that echoes the early work of Leonard Cohen & Vashti Bunyan.
