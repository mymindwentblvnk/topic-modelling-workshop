1) Theatre was an AOR/Melodic Rock Band of the 90's from U.S . 

Members:
Pete Greco - Vocals
Bob Irvine - Guitars, Keyboards
Ron Boyles - Bass
Joe Gumino - Drums

2) Theatre was an experimental chaotic hardcore outfit formed in South Africa, in mid-2008, after the expiration of its member's previous bands. They bring genre-smashing music to the foreground that is both unique in construction and chaotic in design. Theatre was characterised by notably destructive, yet emotive performances with live shows that truly defied the norm. 

JJ - Vocals (now in Take Hand)
Byron - Guitars
Duke - Guitars (now in Blynd Tyger)
Jay-Dee - Bass
Tarquin - Drums
