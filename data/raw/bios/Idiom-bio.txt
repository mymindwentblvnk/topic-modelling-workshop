Exeter four-piece Idiom are at the forefront of the welcomed 2009 rock-rap revival. Formed in Devon in 2005, the hard-working collective take influence from bands as diverse and eclectic as Incubus, Rage Against The Machine, SiKth, System Of A Down and Deftones.

The group have self-released two EPs through their own Dirt Track label, both produced by former Dub War members Jeff and Ginge at the Not In Pill Studios in Newport, Wales.

2006’s Side Show enabled the band showcase their debut tracks on local stages, and 2007’s follow-up Twelve Bar Blues propelled the energetic crew onto a full UK and European tour with Californian nu-metal gods Hed(pe).

In 2007 the group played the infamous Bulldog Bash and Bloodstock festivals in the UK, and in early 2008 the group returned to the stage for a European run of shows with New York hardcore titans and Vagrant Records moshers From Autumn To Ashes. The successful mainland run also included a string of shows with upcoming UK heavyweights Bring Me The Horizon and Brighton superstars Architects.

In May 2008, after hearing the group’s studio material, Benji Webbe – vocalist for Welsh raga-rockers Skindred – personally invited the group onto an impressive two month run of 35 shows around the UK, with Idiom vocalist Matt joining the headliners on stage for a nightly rendition of hit Nobody to packed venues across the country.

In February 2009, Metal Hammer magazine picked Idiom’s track Twelve Bar Blues for inclusion on their cover CD – sharing stereo space with such big names as Lamb Of God, Dimmu Borgir and Deathstars, and the band also received frequent plays on the XFM Rock Show.

Idiom from NC USA:

Drawing from the sound of modern metal/rock and from the intricate songwriting & psychedelia of the 70's, Idiom brings a familiar yet fresh sound to the stage. Fans of hard rock, metal, and progressive rock will all find comfort in the new Idiom sound. Lyrically, Idiom addresses introspective and intelligent topics while the instrumentation reflects this with rhapsodic changes in the songs' dynamics and color.

The band's logo represents the Sanskrit word 'ajna,' which is synonymous with the mind's eye in Western culture. The ajna chakra is an esoteric gate which leads to inner realms of higher consciousness and is often attributed to precognition, clairvoyance, and out-of-body experiences.

The band's debut full-length album A Silent End was released in Fall of 2009, and is a showcase of what this band does best--eclectic and diverse songwriting, explosive guitar work, and intelligent craftsmanship.

"Head to North Carolina to discover Idiom, a young group with enormous potential!!! The music of the American group (particularly the vocals of Steve Grove) remind me of Pain Of Salvation. At present, the group has only one demo with two songs (but what songs!). If it continues in this way, it is likely there will be talk about them in the years to come..." -Heavylaw.com
