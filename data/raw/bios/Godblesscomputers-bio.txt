In recent years he has produced albums, EP and mixtapes with the groups: “Il lato oscuro della costa” and “Delitto perfetto” before arriving at his solo project Godblesscomputers, a container of sounds, images and words. Swanism is his latest work in chronological order, a record where organic and liquids sounds are the musical texture for a perfect balance between hip hop, dub and electronic music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/godblesscomputers">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
