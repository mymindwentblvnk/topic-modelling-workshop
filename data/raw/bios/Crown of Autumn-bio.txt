Crown of Autumn is a Melodic Black/Death Metal band from Italy. As of 2011, the band is active again, having signed to My Kingdom Music after a lengthy hiatus that spanned a decade. Founded in 1996 by Emanuele Rastelli, Crown of Autumn's music is often described as being very atmospheric, with many symphonic elements. The two vocalists split between harsh, rasping growls and hard, clean vocals. 

The band released a demo entitled "Ruins" in 1996, a full length titled "The Treasure Arcane" in 1997 and after many years released "Splendours from the Dark" in 2011.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Crown+of+Autumn">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
