Formed in 2005, West Virginia's Nechochwen is the passionate exploration of Native American Indian heritage through stunning classical guitar instrumentation and lush atmosphere. From the ashes of the band Angelrust, Nechochwen, the sole creator of this art and man from which the "band" receives it's namesake, set out to create a very powerful trip back in time with his music and further explore the tales and lives of his ancestors. Nechochwen is passion, creativity and a powerful spiritual awakening that the listener can feel pouring out of the compositions of this art.

With the debut full-length, "Algonkian Mythos" for Dark Horizon Records, Nechochwen focuses on the era surrounding French and Indian War. By the call of war drums, ritualistic/shamanic/trance-like ambient passages, and bold musical compositions that embrace eclectic/folk instrumentation, "Algonkian Mythos" inspires a vibrant mental journey guided further back in time by ancestral spirits eager to share the tales of how they lived, and died.

On the Bindrune Debut, "Azimuths to the Otherworld", Nechochwen takes us on a 14 track journey into the mysterious world of the Adena and Hopewell people that dwelled in the Ohio River Valley nearly 2 millennia ago. Recorded by Andrew Della Cagna at Sacred Sound Recording Studio, "Azimuths to the Otherworld" is the logical continuation of "Algonkian..." spiritually and musically in a bold mix of classical folk metal. Due to the dark and mystical content of this album, more of an aggressive and uniquely metal influence can be found dancing among the tracks. The results are truly magical/groundbreaking as Nechochwen look deep within and further back in time to lead the spirits back from their home among the stars, to once again traverse the forgotten trails of the Ohio River Valley. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nechochwen">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
