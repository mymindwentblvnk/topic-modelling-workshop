2006 two band members made tribute recording song "Kletva" ("Curse", btw, their first song ever made and only one on native language) to a fallen friend, drummer and founding member of band, Zlatko Mehic Zuba, who died in war in 1993!!! Encouraged PEDJA (throughout 90's played with some musicians of known Norwegian metal bands) and SLOBA (continued to play in Canada, recording and performing with many top line rock bands from ex.Yu, playing over 300 shows) decided to work (after "13" long years) again,despite distances and depleted formation!!!
