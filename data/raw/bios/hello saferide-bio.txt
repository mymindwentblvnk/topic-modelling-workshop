Swedish indie singer/songwriter, Hello Saferide is Annika Norlin, born in Östersund, Sweden, now living in Umeå.

With a warm voice and beautiful melodies she made a slight breakthrough in 2005 with the single My Best Friend. Being a music journalist, it came to great surprise to Norlin when her songs attracted the attention of indie label Razzia Records. After the release of Introducing... Hello Saferide, Norlin assembled a band and played around the world.

In the beginning of 2007 she released an album with lyrics in Swedish, this time under the name Säkert!. The music differs a bit from the music of Hello Saferide.
