Exit Existence is a 5 piece hurricane of epic vocals, catchy riffs, dueling ferocious guitar solos, and full blown metal onslaught, from Rochester New York.

The group was formed in 2009 after their previous melodic death metal, and power metal bands had broken up, forging the genres together for the best of both worlds.

Whether you like brutal riffs, faced paced drums, old school thrash and heavy metal, or just a catchy chorus; Exit Existence has something for you.

The bands EP "Hall of Nightmares" was released in Winter 2010 and is available for free download at their website: www.exitexistence.com

Currently the band is hard at work on their debut full length "Winds of the Cataclysm" and playing live with several local and national/international metal acts.
