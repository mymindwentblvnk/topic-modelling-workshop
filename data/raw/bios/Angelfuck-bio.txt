ANGELFUCK is a crust punk/extreme metal/grindcore band started in North Somerset, UK in the mid-90s. Originally formed as a side project from members of other local punk and metal bands.

Influenced by early Carcass, Napalm Death, Amebix, Doom, Extreme Noise Terror and bands of that ilk.

The first recording "Neurosporasapain (Ways Of The Rotting Kind)" made its way to several underground labels in the days of tape-trading and various tracks appeared on compilation albums around Europe. Metal Hammer Magazine gave the band a glowing review which spurned more interest although ANGELFUCK was not interested in any sort of commercial success and continued to tape trade and just exist.

The members of ANGELFUCK are relatively secret, not as a "stunt" but as the music is meant to be non-commercial.

These days members of the band live between The UK and Sweden but still meet up to record once in a while. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Angelfuck">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
