Mike and Nick played in bands in the desert growing up, including Solarfeast (with ex-Kyuss and Evolution's End member, Chris Cockrell). After Solarfeast broke up in 1995, they formed the drop D-tuned garage punk band The Jack Saints and moved to San Francisco. Bil played in bands in Florida before moving to S.F. where he drummed for Black Queen, Caroliner Rainbow, Totimoshi, the Zodiac Killers and Off Campus. HORNSS started with the musical inspiration of St. Vitus, Black Flag, Overkill (L.A.), Pentagram and WÃ¼rm. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/HORNSS">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
