Born in New Orleans, Pell was uprooted to Starkville, Mississippi by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 at the age of 15. Like many others in NOLA, Katrina decimated the neighborhood where Pell and his family lived, and as a result they were forced to relocate. "All I was able to take with me from New Orleans was the musical culture I grew up in, not my possessions, only memories and life lessons."

"Creating a new life from scratch teaches you resilience," adds Pell. And he's used his determination to pursue a music career. In high school, Pell created beats for his friends using a beat box that his dad gave him. Pell used those skills to help produce tracks on his first 2010 mixtape, "That Feel Good." It was that year that he also formed the collective That Feel Good (TFG), with some friends. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pell">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
