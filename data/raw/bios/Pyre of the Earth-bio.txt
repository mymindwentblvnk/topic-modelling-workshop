Pyre of the Earth formed in 2013 in Glasgow, Scotland, as the members came together under a unifying desire to play slow heavy music. Paying respect to the monolithic riffs and odious vocals of their true doom influences, their myriad past experiences in Glasgow's death, folk-black and power metal scenes give their songwriting an original character which explores influences from post, progressive, sludge and at times black metal while remaining within the doom genre.

The band consists of Eilidh Harris (vocals),  Brenden Crow (guitars),  Jordan Crow (bass) and  Alan Robinson (drums). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pyre+of+the+Earth">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
