Bergström was born in Gävle, Sweden in 1961 but grew up in the city of Stockholm where he also got his MFA at the Royal College of Music in 1982. He has been a professional guitarist for well over twenty-five years now, working in various genres as soloist (recital debut at the Wigmore Hall, London in 1983, solo recording debut in 1986), accompanist and ensemble player. In 1990-92, Bergström took a break to spend two years in New York as a postgraduate student at Juilliard. Since then, he has been active primarily on the chamber music scene. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mats+Bergstr%C3%B6m">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
