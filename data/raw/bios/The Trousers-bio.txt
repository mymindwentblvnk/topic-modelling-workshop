The Trousers is a garage rock/hard rock band from Budapest, Hungary. Their main influences are 60s -70’s rock and roll (Thhe Rolling Stones, Iggy & The Stooges, Led Zeppelin) and contemporary rockbands like Hellacopters or BRMC. They released their first album (Planetary Process) in 2008, and they had a No.1 hit on Hungarian national radio, which was also released int he US and France. The second LP entitled Soul machine came out in 2010, and it was nominated for best hard rock album of the year in Hungary, and they also had an offer from CBS’ Hawaii 5.0 for a song. The third album, Freakbeat is coming out this spring, and they say it will be their strongest. In the past 5 years The Trousers played in Denmark (Gutter City Garage Rock Festival), Germany (Melt!
