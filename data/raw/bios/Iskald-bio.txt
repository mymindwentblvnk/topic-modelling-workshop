Iskald represents ice cold and crystal clear black metal from the land of the midnight sun. Hailing from Sortland in northern Norway, Iskald have crafted out what will most likely stand out as a future classic within the genre.

Fueled by the devotion to Norse mythology and the inspiration of arctic surroundings, founding members Simon Larsen and Aage Krekling started Iskald in early 2005. After a demo, the first EP Northern Twilight was completed by the end of the year. The EP was self-financed and the pressing was limited to 400 copies.

In September 2006, Iskald entered Ballerina Audio (Vintersorg, Naglfar) to record their full-length debut, Shades of Misery. In March 2007, the album was released by Indie Recordings. At its peak, Shades of Misery hits you like a snow blizzard, and at it most melodic the brilliant riffs send shivers down your spine. The response from both press and fans all around the world has been outstanding so far.

After releasing Shades of Misery, the line-up was completed with session members Rene Zonneveld and Espen Solstad, resulting in some live gigs rest of the year...

2008 will hopefully bring Iskald to new heights. As well as playing at the Inferno Festival, a new album and touring will follow! Watch out, because next year is going to be a fucking cold one!!  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Iskald">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
