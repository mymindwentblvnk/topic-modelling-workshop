1. Ripped from N. Canton, Ohio (U.S.A.) was an underground Progressive Death/Thrash metal band. Their intense brand of avant-garde thrash with death metal influences gave them a permanent slot in the history of Mid-western extreme music circles. They first appeared on the compilation: ``Smell Of Gasoline`` - Distant Thunder: Sounds Of The Cleveland Metal Storm (1989)  and went on to release one demo, two EPs and two LPs before disbanding. NOTE: The original vocalist left the band after their first ablum "Blotter" and was replaced with Rick Fisher who's style was similar but altogether more chaotic.
