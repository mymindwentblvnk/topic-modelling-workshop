ANDROID SOUL is a new female fronted metalband based in the Rotterdam area (The Netherlands). Three ex-Wastelands members (Dennis Graafland, Cees van Ooijen and Robert van der Poel) teamed up again to turn their co-operation that lasted for over 10 years into a fresh new start.

Wastelands has been known in this scene for their technical skills, dynamic compositions and dissociation with clich√©-pop and fake-rock overruling the radio charts. During this period the band won several awards and performed frequently throughout all of Holland as headliner to promote the 'Dark Ages' album but also supporting a.o. Green Lizard and Highway Chile.

ANDROID SOUL is a follow-up with dignity keeping the quality-highlights of Wastelands. In the new line-up is chosen for only one guitarist to create space for bombastic synthesizer parts. The rough voice of the old days is replaced by a mezzo-soprano, Linda Aarts (Icaros) which will still be supported by vocal harmonies of the other bandmembers. Jeroen Lankhuizen took place behind the drumkit and received international fame by being drummer for Funeral Winds and Liar of Golgotha and was active with Cees in the progressive metalband 'Orphean'.

In April 2008, the band released their debut CD called Disappointing Paradise. After that, Dennis has been replaced by guitar virtuoso Ronald Boonstra, and Mooz has been replaced with Ywe van der Pol. With these changes, the new music will sound somewhat different than from the cd, but these awesome musicians even make it stronger!! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Android+Soul">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
