Averon is a band that hovers between their own kind of Epic Traditional Doom-metal with atmospheric elements and more straight forward Doom-metal. The first official release 'Serenity' is focused more on catchy melodies and straight forward music. However, on their second release 'An Echo From Beyond' the band seems more influenced by the Epic Doom sound produced by bands such as Solstice and Solitude Aeturnus. But the band clearly has their own sound. Overall, the vocals have a more rough feeling to them than you might expect. Slow headbanging stuff! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Averon">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
