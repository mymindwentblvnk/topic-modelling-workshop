2.) Italian Black Metal band.

Grimness was founded by Valerio and Jonah (ex Solifuge drummer) as a two-man band in December 2001. Basically inspired by the Scandinavian Black Metal acts and the old school of Thrash Metal, they began their early group efforts. In March 2002 Frax (also member of Kuntur) joined the band as a bass player. In the summer of 2002, 5 tracks were ready to be recordedâ€¦ and finally were in October at The Outer Sound Studios of Rome, with Giuseppe Orlando and Massimiliano Pagliuso of Novembre handling the mix. The MCD "Dogma" was ready. In November 2002 another guitarist, Andrea Chiodetti (ex Spiritual Ceremony/Spiritual Front) joined the band as a session player, but he soon became a stable member making great contributions to both arrangements and composition, and enriching the Death Metal sound in the band. Grimness had their debut live with Theatres des Vampires, Infernal Poetry, Ghouls, Brash and Noctifer on December 8th 2002. In the spring of 2003 Frax was replaced by Willer (guitar player/vocalist of stoner/doomers Wizard). In March 2004 the band recorded their first full-length album "Increase Humanity Disgust", to be released by Dutch distributor Two Fat Men in early 2005. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Grimness">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
