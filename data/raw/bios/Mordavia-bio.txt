Mordavia was born in 1998 as a black metal project created by Morgue. 
Over many years this solo work has grown and manifested into different forms with a number of small demo's made that were passed onto a select few along the way. 
With devotion to other bands and projects, time was always against recording a solid body of work until now. Using material written from 2008-09 recording for a debut full length album would finally come of age in 2013 in the form of Mortal.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mordavia">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
