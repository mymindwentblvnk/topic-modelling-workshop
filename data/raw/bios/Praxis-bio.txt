Praxis is an ever-changing musical project led by prolific producer Bill Laswell. Praxis combined elements of different musical genres such as funk, jazz, hip hop  and heavy metal into highly improvised music. The band first appeared in 1992 with the critically acclaimed Transmutation (Mutatis Mutandis), Laswell, guitarist Buckethead, keyboardist Bernie Worrell and drummer Bryan ''Brain'' Mantia have defined the direction of the band over the last 15 years. The group worked with many other artists such as Bootsy Collins, Serj Tankian from System of a Down, Iggy Pop, and Les Claypool of Primus. Due to a lack of activity, Praxis split up on January 2011
