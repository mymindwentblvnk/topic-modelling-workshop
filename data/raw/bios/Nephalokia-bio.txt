Nephalokia tends to bring together the heaviness of modern metal, the brutality of deathcore and the atmospheric ambiances proper to post-hardcore. Smashing the borders between genres in order to express a certain contradiction of emotions. 

 The final line up is settled in 2008 and Nephalokia recordes their first EP during this same year. Since then, they are going from one gig to another, playing with bands such as Gojira, Ultra Vomit, Manimal, Hacride or Eryn Non Dae. 

 The band recorded 'Sunshine', their first album with Mobo from Conkrete Studio (Eryn Non Dae), which will be released on April 22nd 2011 on Klonosphere/Season of Mist.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nephalokia">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
