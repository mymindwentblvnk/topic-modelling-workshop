Though Les Rallizes Dénudés (裸のラリーズ, Hadaka no Rallizes) were one of the earliest and most revolutionary Japanese psychedelic rock bands, and have existed off and on through four decades, they are also one of the most obscure, barely known even in their native country. This cult of noise-terrorists shrouded themselves in mystery, seldom touring and releasing very few records, usually with no discernible label. Their sound presages the later psychedelic experimental noise of Fushitsusha, High Rise and others in the current crop more than any other Japanese psychedelic group from the late '60s. 

In 1970, Les Rallizes Dénudés member Wakabayashi was one of nine people involved in the hijacking of Japan Airlines Flight 351, a Boeing 727, by Japanese Communist League-Red Army Faction, an incident commonly referred to as the "Yodogo (or Yodo-go) Hijacking". Wakabayashi and other members of the hijackers were given asylum in North Korea after the plane was taken to Mirim Airport.

Singer Takashi Mizutani was allegedly offered a role in the hijacking but turned it down. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Les+Rallizes+Denudes">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
