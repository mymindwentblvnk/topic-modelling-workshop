Louisville, Kentucky native Christopher Browder may look unassuming enough, but he's a man who's both prone to embracing what's in front of him and running with it, and an artist who's not afraid to look over his shoulder for inspiration. 

His heartfelt second album, Dig Up The Dead, released under the moniker Mansions, was released April 5 through Burning House Records/King Bones Recordings.

Recorded in the various houses and apartments Browder found himself in, all across the Southeast, over a six-month period, this deeply personal album acts as a candid and compelling look into one man's psyche, in the midst of change and nostalgia. And while previous touring-mates joined him on some tracks, Browder completed the lion's share of recording alone. It's an impressive follow-up to March 2009's critically acclaimed New Best Friends (Doghouse Records) and last spring's well-received B-sides compilation. 

Mansions live shows are as unique and all-inclusive as Browder's music - playing, as he does, with a touring band made up of a variety of both friends and strangers; a collaborative endeavor he's previously showed off while on tour with the likes of Get Up Kids and David Bazan. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mansions">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
