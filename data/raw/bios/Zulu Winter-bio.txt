Zulu Winter was a five piece Indie rock band formed in London, UK in 2011. The band consisted of Will Daunt (vocals & guitar), Iain Lock (bass), Dom Millard (keyboards), Henry Walton (guitar) and Guy Henderson (drums).

They released their first single, "Never Leave", on Double Denim Records on 7 November 2011, and played a BBC Radio 6 introducing session at Maida Vale for Steve Lamacq the same week. The band subsequently signed to Play It Again Sam. Their second single "We Should Be Swimming" was released in February 2012 and was Zane Lowe's Hottest Record In The World on his BBC Radio 1 show, on the 11 January 2012. The band also received features in the UK press, including a two page spread in Q (magazine),"New Band Of The Day" on the Guardian website & a mention in the Independent's "Music One's To Watch Lists: This millennium’s school yard brawl".
The band released their debut album "Language" on 14 May,2012 and supported Keane on their 2012 UK tour. They released their third single "Silver Tongue" in April 2012 which was once again made Zane Lowe's Hottest Record In The World on his BBC Radio 1 show.

The band unceremoniously split via facebook when their slick, emotional indie was met with an insouciant shrug on June 5, 2014. They released a final 10-track mini-album entitled Stutter on July 21, 2014. It is a collection of studio and home recordings the band "didn't want to fester on a hard drive somewhere". NME reported that 'To be fair, it’s glossy and cohesive for an outtakes record, but aside from the subtle, groove-laden title track, nothing here really competes for your attention. Now is the winter of their discontent.'
