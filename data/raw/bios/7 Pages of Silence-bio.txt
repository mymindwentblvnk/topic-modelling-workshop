Hello! We are 7 Pages of Silence - modern metal band from Kharkov, Ukraine.
We play since 2006, and there were good times, were bad times.
We play music, that we like - modern metal with some mdm and some metalcore influences.
You may check some of our songs on http://myspace.com/7pagesofsilence, or use google and download our debut album.
