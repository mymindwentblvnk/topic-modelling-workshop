An experimental death-metal project of Matej Lipsky from Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC, founded in 1995. 

The conception of Negative Face music is said to be (by Matej): "We are trying to express the contrast conception of the modern underground music and other styles. In our compositions mostly predominates death/doom metal roots which we cross with jazz, folk, esoteric and even classical music, but you can find there also country, grind core, grunge, punk or street rock fragments. How succesfully we manage to do so is up on our listeners to decide. Our style is unidentified and that's why we have invented the expression for it - the experimental positive music."
