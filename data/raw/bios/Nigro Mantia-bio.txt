NIGRO MANTIA had a totally unique musical concept. MERCYFUL FATE-like riffing, but of a very laid out, almost soundscape-ish dimension. The singer is somewhere out in space, “feeling the exploding orgasm”, as he sings. Stunning (dis-) harmonies, layers of musical texture, but all very held back, subtle. What also strikes me is that the whole thing doesn’t come over as “epic”, wagnerian Metal at all. There’s no “glory”, no pathetic expressionism, but a very, may I say, gentle introspection. Bands like RUSH come to mind quickly, but then again, this is not art rock whatsoever. “Poetry of Subculture” stands there as one of the finest moments in the history of 80s Metal. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nigro+Mantia">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
