Redneck Rampage consists of five Estonian country-bred awsome-looking metalheads that grew up with the same goal in their minds: to make truly skull-crushing rock'n'roll. Now, with some groovy guitar licks, heart-bummeling drum lines and elegant vocals, they have managed to achive the highest level of true groove metal.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Redneck+Rampage">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
