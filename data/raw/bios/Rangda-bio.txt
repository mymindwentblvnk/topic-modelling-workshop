Rangda, the child-eating demon queen of Balinese mythology, finds a sonic voice via the epic, thrashing jammerisms of Richard Bishop, Ben Chasny, and Chris Corsano. A useful tool for exercising your own demons: pick up the debut album from this evil super group and pump it through your community blaster!

Chris Corsano - Drums
Sir Richard Bishop - Guitar
Ben Chasny (Six Organs of Admittance) - Guitar
