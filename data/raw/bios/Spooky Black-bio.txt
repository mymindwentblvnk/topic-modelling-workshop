Corbin Smidzik, better known by his stage name Spooky Black (and sometimes known as “Lil’ Spook”) is a young, up and coming R&B singer from St. Paul, Minnesota. A somewhat unconventional artist, he is best known for the music video he released for his song, “Without You” in February 2014. The song features 15-year old "Spooky" wearing turtlenecks, a gold chain and a durag while singing over ethereal instrumentals. 

Despite his chosen aesthetic, or perhaps in part because of it, Spooky Black has become something of an internet sensation. Spooky's “Without You” has received over a million views on YouTube and his "Black Silk" mixtape is the focus of a growing cult following.
