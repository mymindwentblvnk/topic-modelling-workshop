Inward Escape is the core creative invocation of Atremore, and vice versa. Atremore founded the solo group in October 2003, which at the time was strictly a dark ambient/ neo-classical entity. The solo project was a stylistic alternative to NeXuS, now defunct. 

Inward Escape's style can be thought of as Avant Garde Black Metal / Dark Ambient.

Various early demos were recorded, and circulated in small numbers (these are not listed below). To this day, there exists 4 official Inward Escape releases:
