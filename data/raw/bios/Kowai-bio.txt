Treading on the edge of rock and metal, KOWAI has an aptitude for melody, atmosphere and intensity, alongside elements of symphony, melancholy and doom. Their sound palette – the result of their various backgrounds – is as rich as it is dynamic. Hailing from the Netherlands, this six-piece band is ready to take on the world with the release of their first full-length album DISSONANCE: a nine-song magnum opus filled with haunting and fierce songs.

Although this is their first full release, KOWAI already has an impressive track record. Among over 60 gigs, festivals and radio performances, they have opened for international metal acts (e.g., Trail of Tears and Stream of Passion), made their way into the finals of national music competitions (performing their hit Pride for Dutch national Radio 538), and performed abroad the Netherlands.

KOWAI is currently working hard to promote the release of DISSONANCE, which is produced by internationally renowned producer JOOST VAN DEN BROEK (ex-After Forever) and JEFFREY REVET (Stream of Passion). Furthermore, alongside their full-blown electric fury, KOWAI is exploring a more quiet side with unplugged performances.

KOWAI is fronted by Laura van Nes (vocals), and completed by Arjen Bosma (guitar & grunts), Lars Deelman (guitar), Ruben Marrenga (keyboard), Joey Wouters (bass) and Joost Lobbes (drums). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kowai">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
