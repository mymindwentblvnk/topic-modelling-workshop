Ravenbanner was a greek NSBM band featuring Jarl von Hagall of Der St√ºrmer, Athalwolf of Wolfnacht, and Saturno of Alastor and Agarthia, founded when they gathered in Kerkyra back in the Summer of 2000. There was no material, no lyrics, not even a band name; everything was created in one evening. Two songs were recorded that day (For The Might Of Heathen Blood Chapter I and II) and another two unreleased songs of Athalwolf were added (Wolf In Dungeon Chapters I and II) to complete the demo. The result was the "For the Might of Heathen Blood" demo released in 2000, it features a few different styles on it: "Old-school" style black metal, ambient, and black metal ambient similar to something you would hear off Burzum's Filosofem. In the winter of 2001 Saturno and Athalwolf met each other in Athens and recorder another six songs for the next and last release of Ravenbanner. These songs stayed instrumental and unreleased until October 2006 that Jarl Von Hagall decided to finally add the vocals and release these songs as full length CD (..And Ravens Sing Our Glorious Past), including the demo. This is the tombstone of Ravenbanner.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ravenbanner">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
