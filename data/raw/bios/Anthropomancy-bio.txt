1) Anthropomancy was Doom/Death Metal band from UK (West Yorks) formed in 1989. Relesed only one demo in 1993 and disbanded soon after that.

2) Anthropomancy started out as a nameless project by vocalist, music and lyric writer W. He developed ideas for the music but needed to find someone with whom he'd be able to express them more easily. His thoughts remained in the back of his head, waiting to be born in the form of music.

The embodyment of his musical spirit was found in a fellow soul namely M, with whom W lost contact for over three years, when they met at a gig of Blood-Drenched. W explained his view of the music which he wanted to create, and so M's aching muscles and weary bones would try to dig up enough soil for Anthropomancy, which would be the name for the band during their demo and album, to fester in.

With 'Siren of Darkness' on the way M decided to remain a session member and fell back to the shades of the band. The band put the album on a hold and M started playing in a different band and so Anthropomancy was put on ice. Both members have stated it to be 'R.I.P.'.
