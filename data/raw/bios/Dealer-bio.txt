There are three bands with this name;

1) Dealer — a young band forged by experienced musicians from many of Australia’s finest heavy music acts (Alpha Wolf, Northlane, Iconoclast to name a few) — are just that; the source, patient zero for a fresh, vicious-but-melancholic take on nu-metal infused metalcore. 

Combining grating, grisly breakdowns with a grim sonic aesthetic and moments of eerie, off-putting ambience akin to Happiness in Self-Destruction-era The Plot In You, Dealer sling their own surreal blend of hard-hitting heaviness and contagious, ear-catching melodies without remorse or abandon. 

By exploring dark, haunting lyrical themes in combination with crushing salvos of dissonant, spastic aggression, Dealer use darkness and introspective dissection to tell a tale of regrowth and rejuvenation. 

Through exploration, self-discovery and trepidation, Dealer take their listeners on a journey through self-loathing and mutilation, ending in change and a sense of redemption, giving its message the same unique, ear-catching nature that the band’s music so readily boasts.

2) Dealer, formed in Cirencester (UK) in 1979, was a NWOBHM band.

3) DEALER, founded in 1999, made their way through deserts, over mountains and through deep valleys, with a heart for Rock'n Roll and a six-string to state it.

This four-piece is rooted in several corners of Rock music. Finally the guys find themselves rockin' out like the Rolling Stones in fury, Deep Purple in anger and a bunch of Austrian shepherds on magic mushrooms.

In 2006 Dealer released their 2nd longplayer „Backdoor Business“, with a focus on classic songwriting and an attitude and a curtesy to the great ones, the mean. Those, your parents warned you of, that turned out to be real good guys ...

... sounds cliché? Yeah, and that's what makes it. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dealer">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
