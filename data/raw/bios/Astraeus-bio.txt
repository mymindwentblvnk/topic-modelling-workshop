Formed in the spring of 2012 from previous members of Towers of Veritas and Timeless Memory, Astraeus set out to bring a unique blend of crushing detuned rhythms, beautiful ambient clean guitars, mind-bending technical drums, and sexy bass grooves. With the release of their debut EP "Solipsis" behind them, they're already working on their sophomore EP. Be on the lookout for new music in 2014!
