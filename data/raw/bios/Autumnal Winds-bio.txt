Autumnal Winds is a melodic black/death metal project by Tanner Anderson (Celestiial, Azrael).  The band has been re-enacted and renamed Obsequiae.  Some of the songs on Venerari Sacra Mysteria can be heard on Obsequiae's self titled demo.  A full length will soon be released on Bindrune in 2011. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Autumnal+Winds">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
