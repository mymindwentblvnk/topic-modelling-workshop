The music of DREAM OF NEBIROS can be described as ROMANTIK ANAL METAL, and is about a mix of brutality, melancholy and erotism, linked with an essence of poetry and vulgarity. DREAM OF NEBIROS sees the light in the dark winter of 1994, under the name of BLACK HATE, playing trash death with spanish lyrics. Because of the instability of the band, it is decided to shelter for a while and to concentrate in the future. ...AND THE SOUL CANNOT TRESPASS THE DREAM (1996) was the very first stigmata: the first demo that would define the way of wich the band is now. The 1000 copies from this demo were sold out quickly, and this "opened the doors" to the band for future gigs at the North of Mexico and the USA.NIGHTLY SILENCE split e.p. (with DEMISE, 1997), a live record from DISTORSION RADIO SHOW Studio (a massive event), was also sold out. 

The acceptance from the public, forces the band to come back to the studio for second time and record their next demo titled FROM PASSION TO BESTIALITY (1998), but it can't be released because of some problems. 

ANCIENT POETRY adv. (1999/2000), is released as the first CD demo of the band, paying more attention to promotion and disbribution of the material. Because of the big demand from the public to acquire the previous demos, DREAM OF NEBIROS decide to compile the best from those demos and some new themes and unreleased ones plus a CD ROM and MP3. And as the result, finally the first album is created and is titled: INTO THE CRITICAL EVOLUTION (2001). 

By this time the band had faced the chance to play with some international bands like Marduk, Impaled Nazarene, Skinless, Incantation, to mention a few. 2002 was a year of change, new creations and some gigs. The band experiments on his new songs with dark and gothic sounds, and black metal. On January of 2003 is released the NAKED IN A MORBID DREAM album. This album opened the doors to DREAM OF NEBIROS through an successful tour at Germany, in cities such as Neuss, Düsseldorf, Meerbush, Ratingen, Solingen, Iserlohn, etc. 

DREAM OF NEBIROS close the year with a great concert next to one of the more representative bands of mexican metal.... BRUJERÍA, organized by  D99 DISTORSION RADIO SHOW. 

On March 19, 2004 DoN had the chance to play with Hypocrisy on their "Final Arrival Tour 2004". 

On June 2005 they played on the Summer Breeze festival in Germany. 
The power and presence of this band onstage makes a big impression.

Right now they are working on a new album. The prerelease is called Causing Mayhem Since 1994, and includes 4 songs, 2 of them live.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dream+Of+Nebiros">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
