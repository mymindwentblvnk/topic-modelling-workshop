Norrsken were a band from Sweden psychedelic rock band founded in 1995.

Norrsken, which translates to aurora borealis from Swedish, formed in 1995 originally under the name Winterorb. They put out two demos, Norrsken and Hokus Pokus, as well as a 7" single, "Armageddon." The band is best remembered as guitarist Magnus Pelander's band prior to forming Witchcraft. Vocalist Joakim Nilsson and bassist Rikard Edlund joined Albatros and then formed Graveyard, both bands in the 1970s hard rock genre. Drummer Kristoffer Sjödahl joined Dead Man. Nilsson's brother, Johannes, currently plays bass and sings in stoner rock group Asteroid.
