Sons of Magdalene is one of several projects by Joshua Eustis, also known for his work with Telefon Tel Aviv.  The music created by Sons of Magdalene shows a proclivity for classical forms and instrumentation as opposed to the modern electronic milieu in which Eustis has hitherto found himself placed; moreover it shows a more demanding approach towards the listener than any of his other work.  The first set of releases by Sons of Magdalene will be works for chamber orchestra and tape, followed by a cycle of quartets. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sons+Of+Magdalene">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
