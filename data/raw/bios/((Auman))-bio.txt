As a form of homage to the king of the jungle, ((AUMAN)) used the mighty roar as the name of the heavy rock'n'roll band from the Southern part of Sumatera; with Zarbin Sulaiman (bass), Farid Amriansyah (vocals), Aulia Effendy (drums), Erwin Wijaya (guitar) and Ahmad Ruliansyah (guitar) as collaborators. In addition to Dagger Stab vocalist who returned to the land of his blood, the members of the explosive rock unit, ((AUMAN)), are also the honourable member of Rongsokan, Grey, ArtLogica and Delirium; which are vanguard bands of Palembang's alternative scene.

((AUMAN)) not only used the appalling roar of the beast as their name; the bold & elegant beauty of Sumateran Tiger also becomes ((AUMAN)) inspiration musically. The attitude and raw energy of punk fused with masculine heavy rock as the band dangerous arsenal. Fierce distortion roaring from the amplifiers, mixed with sweat and "Tuak" (Sumateran palm wine) as fuel of aggression of these five rockers from South Sumatra ..

"Greetings from us, Sriwijaya Rimau Rockers .. It's way hotter down South, and we're gonna give you some love baby!"

In 2015, they disbanded when preparing 2nd album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/((AUMAN))">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
