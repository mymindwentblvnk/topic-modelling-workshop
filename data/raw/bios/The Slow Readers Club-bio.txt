The Slow Readers Club are a Manchester based Indie / Electro
band who’s output ranges from insanely catchy upbeat indie to
angry, introspective downbeat ballads. Their music has drawn
comparisons with Interpol, The Killers and Arcade Fire.

Their critically acclaimed debut single Sirens was played on BBC
Introducing, NME, Q Radio and NME TV. Their youtube channel
has seen 12,500 views to date helped in no small part by the
video for ‘Block out the Sun’ featuring on Coldplay's website.

The band includes three former members of Omerta who
released three critically acclaimed and collectable singles and
whose XFM live session earned them a top five place in the
sessions of the year.

The Slow Readers Club have been building a loyal local following
from appearances at The Deaf Institute, Night and Day and
Friends of Mine festival amongst others. They have also had
great support from DJ’s at Manchester's biggest Indie night clubs
5th Avenue and 42 Street. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Slow+Readers+Club">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
