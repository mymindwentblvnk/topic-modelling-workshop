Debut album available as a free download or pay what you want here: http://axiallead.bandcamp.com/

Progressive/avant-garde metal merging King Crimson, Rush and Iron Maiden with other hard to place influences for flavor.

Concept album description: "Our first album, entitled “of infamous credentials” features eleven songs, following the recently recovered memories of an escaped convict lost at sea, who washes off on the shores of a utopian island-city in the middle of nowhere. From start to finish, his choices lead him through an uncertain world and strange realms where reality is bent by his own moral decay, as he twists the rules that bind together his past and future lives."
