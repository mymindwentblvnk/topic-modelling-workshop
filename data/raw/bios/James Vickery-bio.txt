South London soul singer James Vickery started out in the early 2010s as a folksy singer/songwriter, accompanying himself on acoustic guitar and singing soul-inflected tunes. His early career consisted of participating in various television musical competition shows, including The X Factor and Open Mic UK. Successful performances on these shows brought Vickery new connections, including collaborative work with guitarist Phil Braithwaite and vocalist Lance Ellington. Perhaps the biggest connection for Vickery came in the form of a collaboration with indie electronic hitmakers Disclosure, who used his vocals on their track "Flow" in 2015. By the next year, even more doors had opened for the young singer, and in addition to further collaborations with established names, he released his debut EP,  "Complexion," in 2017. In 2018, he followed up with a second EP called "Until Morning". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/James+Vickery">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
