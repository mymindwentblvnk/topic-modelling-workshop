The Venereal Collapse are a heavy metal band from Wigan. The band formed in February 2005 under the name Torn Forgiveness by the two guitarists, Ian Wadsworth & Micheal McGuiness and were later joined by Matty Mcdonald on Bass and Vinny Worswick on Drums. Now an official band practicing reguarly they decide a Vocalist is much needed. John Griffiths joined the band.
The band then started looking for gigs. The bands first gig was with Sandwretch and Sentimental Values at Pemberton Labour Club. After this show The Venereal Collapse went on to play more, and more gigs in and around the Wigan area.
After the recording of the band's first demo, John was removed from the band and replaced by Andy Leggott, making the band a more brutal & tighter outfit.
Andy's first gig with the band was at The Tavern in Wigan, with support from Strain.
Vinny later decided to quit the band, and after the release of a new demo, on which Andy played drums, the band were joined by Greg Brown.
The band are currently working on new material, and playing as many gigs as possible.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Venereal+Collapse">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
