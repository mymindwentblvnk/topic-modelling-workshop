Blame is a name of, at least, four artists:

1) A rock band from Staffordshire, UK:

Following the demise of Brighouse' previous bands Ortega and In Colour the songwriter set about a new project; one based around the staple influences that first drove him towards the guitar all those years ago. Realising the 'timeless' qualities present in so many of his favourite records Brighouse picked up a well worn guitar and began writing. After drafting a three song 'demo' he enlisted friend and lyricist Sam Johnson to help supply vocal accompaniment and complete the tracks. Pleased with how the demo came together Brighouse took to writing further tracks; songs which would eventually make up the bands' debut.

Blame is the product of a sleepy suburban town and its ability to drive residents indoors on rainy days. Inspired by both the music of their youth and the music they favour today Brighouse and Johnson set about to create the type of songs that they themselves enjoy listening to. Blame consider themselves "frontier men" pioneering for the soul of rock & roll.
