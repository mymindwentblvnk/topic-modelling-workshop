White Fence's trippy, distortion-laced, psychedelic pop-influenced tunes (sounding, in other words, something along the lines of a warped cassette tape featuring The Left Banke or The Merry-Go-Round) are the brainchild of Timothy Presley (also a member of the like-minded groups Strange Boys and Darker My Love). The project's self-titled debut was released on the Woodsist label in the spring of 2010. For the project's next release, White Fence Is Growing Faith , Presley didn't change much. The January 2011 album follows the same sometimes goofy, always trippily tuneful template of the debut.  - AMG <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/White+Fence">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
