Electric Kif is a Miami-based power quartet that explores the boundaries between rock, jazz fusion and drum-and-bass. The band is a dynamic mash of hard-hitting groove, high-octane riffs and cosmic melody. 

Made up of bassist Rodrigo Zambrano, keyboardist Jason Matthews, drummer Armando Lopez and guitarist Eric Escanes, Electric Kif has performed at Ground Up Music Festival, Rochester International Jazz Festival, Miami Downtown Jazz Festival and elsewhere. The band has opened for artists such as Snarky Puppy, Ghost-Note, Karl Densonâ€™s Tiny Universe, The Motet and Stanley Jordan. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Electric+Kif">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
