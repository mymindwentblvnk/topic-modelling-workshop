Right from its inception in early 2000, Demonic Resurrection has been raising eyebrows. Even with its unstable lineup 'till 2003 the band released its debut album just 9 months after forming. While the album was amateurish it was the 1st for an Indian Metal band to independently release a CD. The album however did receive some praise from the local fans in the Mumbai scene as well as few small underground zines and distro's after it was re-recorded and released in 2001 with Demonstealer on vocals/guitars, Nikita on vocals/keys, Aditya aka Count Varathora on Bass and Yash on Drums. 

However, in 2003 this lineup was dissolved and the band was reborn with the Demonstealer on guitars/vocals, Husain on bass, Mephisto on keys and JP on drums. With this line-up the band wrote new material and in 2005 released their highly acclaimed album ‘A Darkness Descends’ on Demonstealer Records. The album received rave reviews from many metal websites including a 9/10 from The Metal Observer. In 2006, Pradeep joined the band as lead guitarist while drummer JP parted ways. As the band struggled to find a permanent replacement for JP in April 2007 they recorded their EP ‘Beyond The Darkness’ with Demonstealer taking over the drum duties in the studio as well. Finally in July 2007 the band found a permanent replacement in skin slammer Viru. In 2008 guitarist Pradeep left the band and was replaced by Daniel Rego. Demonic Resurrection toured all across India in 2009 and also started recording their 3rd full-length album titled 'The Return To Darkness' which was released on 15th Jan 2010 along with their first music video for the single 'The Unrelenting Surge Of Vengeance'.

…And the resurrection continues.
