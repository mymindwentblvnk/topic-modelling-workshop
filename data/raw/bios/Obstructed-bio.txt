Band Bio from official web-site :
An all-improvised drum-guitar/vocals -duo. Formed at the end of august 2006, while recording some other stuff at our bombshelter. The idea of playing improvised crust we got from the crappy bands, which made us think if its possible to create better songs than they have just by playing whatever riffs comes first in mind, shouting whatever comes to our mind. So we tried and got some stuff recorded. And it was hell of a fun!
