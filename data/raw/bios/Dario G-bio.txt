Dario G are a dance music group formed in Crewe, England, UK in 1996. 

The act was named after then Crewe Alexandra manager, Dario Gradi. Its founding members are Paul Spencer, Scott Rosser and Stephen Spencer. Paul Spencer is the only remaining member of the trio.

In 1997, they hit #2 on the UK Singles Chart with "Sunchyme", a song built around a sample of "Life In A Northern Town", a Top 10 hit for The Dream Academy in 1985, and hit #5 with the follow-up "Carnaval de Paris", relating to the 1998 football World Cup in France. "Sunchyme" also hit #1 on the American Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart in that year. A less successful version of "Carnaval de Paris" was released in 2002, for the World Cup in South Korea and Japan.

In March 2000 their song "Voices" featuring vocals from Vanessa Qui√±ones, produced by Peter Oxendale, was used for the film "The Beach". The track was taken from their album "Sunmachine", and was released as 4 different CD singles after the movie became a success. 

In December 2000, they released "Dream To Me" with vocals by Ingfrid Straumstoyl. In 2003 they released "Heaven Is Closer" and later "Say What's On Your Mind".

Dario G's music, the song "Voices" in particular, is frequently used as background music on British TV shows.
