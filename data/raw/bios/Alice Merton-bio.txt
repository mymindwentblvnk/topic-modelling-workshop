She released her debut full album, Mint in 2019.  Reviewing the album for PopMatters, critic Elizabeth Woronzoff states "Merton's ability to find hope in the negative was the catalyst for MINT's standout track, "Why So Serious". Written as a response to critics who wrote Merton off as a one-hit-wonder, "Why So Serious" castigates the cynics. As specified in MINT's press release, Merton comments, "Music is supposed to be fun! We don't write songs to be hits, we write songs so we feel good." More so, the track, as well as the majority of the album, reminds listeners to live in the moment and to unshackle from the negativity.
