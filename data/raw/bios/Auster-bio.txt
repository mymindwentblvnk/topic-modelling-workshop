"Auster is a Brazilian Extreme Metal band (Symphonic/Gothic) formed in São Paulo in early 2010. Thenceforth, the band has been composing sereval songs, since then, their work and technic have just improved.Their songs are remarkable for the technical and strong drums with Cauê Moreno, a striking and agressive vocal with Claudio Cardinali, heavy-melodic guitar and bass riffs with Evandro Moraes (rhythm guitar), Luiz Kazemiro (Lead guitar) and last but not least everything is harmonically adorned by Rodrigo Takahira's keybords. The lyrics are deeply influenced by a classical and romantic literature, bringing up a strong accent of a death/love relation to their writings. Auster has been increasingly reaching  better opinions amongst fans of extreme metal, growing fastly on the metal scene of São Paulo. Currently, the band is recording its songs, for a possible end-of-2013 release"
