Hailing from Cincinnati, Ohio,  Thrash Metal stalwarts Split the Abyss began backstage during a performance of Little Shop of Horrors at the School for the Creative and Performing Arts in Cincinnati Ohio. A chance meeting between guitarist/vocalist Max Kessler and drummer Woody Corsini was the catalyst for the creation of one of Cincinnati's finest Heavy Metal bands. Split the Abyss was created to be a brutal thrash metal band in the vein of classic Slayer, Sodom, Dark Angel and Kreator. Also in the formula were some of the technical flourishes of Toxik and Fates Warning and the old school Death Metal tenets of Death, Morbid Angel and Dismember.

Guitarist Mark Green joined the band through an ad on craigslist in 2008. The summer of 2010 saw the band finally made its live debut and release its self titled first album.

The writing process for the second album began in early 2012. Current bass player Matt Hamlin would join the band that September in response to a Facebook post. Throughout the summer of 2013 Split the Abyss wrote and rehearsed what would become their second full length album "With Savage Intent." The album would be released on November 23rd 2013. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Split+The+Abyss">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
