The name moravia can refer to two bands, one band currently using the name, and another which has now changed its name.

Due to Last.fm's rules relating to dual listings, both bands must appear on this one page.


1. The current MORAVIA

MORAVIA is a catchy Indie Rock band from Sydney, Australia formed in 2005. They released 3 track debut EP "Probably The Last You'll Ever Hear From Us" (2008, Delusion Records)  which went on to receive radio play on respected Australian youth radio network TripleJ, and win a V-RAW Unsigned band competition, which gave MORAVIA a free film clip for hit single "I Loved Ann Jones".
