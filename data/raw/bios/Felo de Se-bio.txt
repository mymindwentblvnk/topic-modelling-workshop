Felo De Se is a Belgian band of Melodic Death Metal, clearly influenced by Finnish bands as Wolfheart or Insomnium. The music combines acoustic melodies and harshness of Death Metal. Felo De Se was initially founded as a one-man-band during summer 2016.
In early 2017, Joachim Kinet, band’s founder, released the first EP, “Fidelis In Se”, consisting of five tracks. A short time later was revealed an acoustic version of “Fall of Ikaros”, EP’s second track, on YouTube.
In the beginning of 2018 new members joined the crew: Lionel Delmay (lead guitar), Benoit Hogge (drums), Innokenty Gritskevitch (bass guitar). They have all ambition to take band’s music to a new level. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Felo+De+Se">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
