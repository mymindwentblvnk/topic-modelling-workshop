Festival of Mutilation (FoM) is formed in 2007 in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. They are brutal/ technical oriented death metal band which is mostly inspired with Nile as their primary influence. 
First line-up of the members was: Ermin Habibović (vocals), Jasenko Džipa (guitar), Saša Džino (bass) and Marko Gačnik (drums). They worked  together for two years and recorded first debut album Gods Of Infernal Desolation which is promoted in autumn 2009 after Ermin has left the band. 
They replaced Ermin with new and younger female vocal Hana Hadžajlić for a short time, who was also vocal in local death/grindcore metal band Ambrosia.

Their current and permanent line-up is filled with vocals of Goran Džidić but band is also richer with one more guitar as Goran is also playing this instrument.

The band is recently signed by Old Cemetary Records from USA.
