ORPHAN ALLIES were a female fronted Heavy Metal/Hard Rock quintet formed in Chicago, Illinois, USA in 1982.

Their only release was the full length "Running From The Law" LP, released by French label Dream Records in 1986. The outstanding vocals of Little Orphan E.V. are the most impressive aspect of the bands sound. There are several good songs spread throughout the record, but the poor production does the record no favours, giving the tracks a samey feel. Even so, it's become a much sought after collectors piece, with copies going at around $60-$80 US nowadays. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Orphan+Allies">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
