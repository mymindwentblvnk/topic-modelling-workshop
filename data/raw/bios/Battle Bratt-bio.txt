Power/Heavy Metal band formed in 1984 in New York City. Released several early demos before their first full-length "Battle Bratt" was released in 1988. After disbanding for the better part of two decades, the band reunited and released a full-length album in 2006, alongside an Anthology album, and another full-length in 2007.
