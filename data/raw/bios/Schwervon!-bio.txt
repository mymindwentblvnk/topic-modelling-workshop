Schwervon! is a two piece American band born on the Lower East Side of New York City. Nan Turner (Nan & The One Night Stands) plays drums. Matthew Roth (Major Matt Mason USA) plays guitar. They both sing. Their band name is taken from the warped abbreviation of an urban slang, meaning: “to do something well in one’s own way or in a unique manner, usually involving members of another sex.”

Schwervon! have been described as Antifolk, Minimalist Rock, Noise Pop, DIY, and even  90’s Indie Revivalist. Their longish career spans five albums and three seven inches. Schwervon! are a perpetual experiment between a drumset, a guitar, a couple and a song. But a particular reaction to their music has remained consistent, as David Gedge of The Wedding Present so eloquently put it: “I’m not sure how just two people manage to make such a big sound!” 

Schwervon! have toured the world and shared the stage with Thurston Moore, Guided By Voices, The Vaselines, Belle and Sebastian,The Wedding Present, King Missile, Kimya Dawson, Lucy Dacus, R. Ring (Kelley Deal & Mike Montgomery), Jeffrey Lewisand other luminaries.

In 2012 Nan and Matt moved from NYC to Shawnee, Kansas where they presently call home.
