Girlschool started in 1975 when Enid Williams (Bass, Vocals) and Kim McAuliffe (Rhythm Guitar, Vocals) formed an all girl rock covers band called Painted Lady in South London. 

Kelly Johnson and Denise Dufort later joined and in April 1978 they changed their name to Girlschool.

Their first single Take it all away was released on the City Records label which led to them gaining a Motörhead support slot on the Overkill tour in 1979. 

Having signed with Lemmy´s record company Bronze later that year, the band released their first album Demolition in 1980. 

After touring Japan in 1982, Enid left and was replaced by Gil Weston of The Killjoys and Girlschool recorded their third album Screaming Blue Murder.

When Kelly left to live in L.A. she was replaced by Cris Bonacci on lead guitar and singer Jackie Bodimead on lead vocals for the 1985 album Running Wild. 

After many more line-up changes and releases on various labels, the original bassist/vocalist Enid rejoined the band in 2000, together with Jackie Chambers. In 2002 the band released the 21st Anniversary: Not that Innocent album. 

Their 12th and latest output is the re-recorded Hit and Run: Revisited. Girlschool continued to tour Europe and South America in 2011-12 and returned in Japan in 2013.  In early 2015, they recorded a new album titled 'Guilty as Sin' with producer Chris Tsangarides, which was released on 13 November 2015.  On 30 January 2019, it was announced on the band's website that "Girlschool have parted ways once again with bassist Enid Williams" and that Tracey Lamb would return to replace her.
