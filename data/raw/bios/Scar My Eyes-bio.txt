Royston (Brown Town), Hertfordshire. U.K.
Coming from a place more well known for it's heroin habits than local music scene, you could forgive these guys for being a little bit different to your average metal band. While most bands around the U.K. had some sort of blueprint to follow, Scar My Eyes sat back in a small youth centre in the depths of no-where and constructed a sound both heavy, and heartfelt.

Combining their love for thrash metal, hardcore and heavy grooves, Scar My Eyes created a new, refreshing take on modern music adding a darker edge that truly sets them out from the rest....A formidable live act...to say the least...

With the successful nationwide sale of their Double 'A' Side single recorded by Dan Weller and Justin Hill of ex SiKTh (R.I.P) and now 'Minutes', Scar My Eyes have since released their debut EP 'This Machine...' (again recorded by Dan and Justin) After a successful month long UK tour in support of their latest EP 'This Machine...'

Scar My Eyes have signed a record deal with TMG (Transcend Media Group) to release 'This Machine...' nationwide on May 25th! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Scar+My+Eyes">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
