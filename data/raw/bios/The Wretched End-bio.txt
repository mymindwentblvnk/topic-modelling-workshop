THE WRETCHED END was formed in 2008 as creative collaboration between Samoth (luminary of such infamous Black Metal acts as Emperor and Zyklon, amongst many others) and Cosmo (Mindgrinder). Samoth and Cosmo previously worked together on the deathpunk project Scum and Cosmo also played bass with Zyklon when they toured Europe as special guest for Morbid Angel in 2001. The two have long spoken about collaborating on an extreme metal project. Most of the material for the debut album was composed throughout 2008, and by spring 2009 a full pre-production consisting of 11 tracks was recorded.

In the summer of 2009, Swede Nils Fjellström (Dark Funeral, In Battle, Aeon) was confirmed as the drummer and the drums were recorded in Strand Studio, Oslo, September 2009. The album recording continued through the end of 2009 and was completed in the first half of 2010. The recording line-up consists of Samoth on lead and rhythm guitar, Cosmo on lead and rhythm guitar, bass and vocals and Nils Fjellström on drums.

THE WRETCHED END can musically best be described as a "Deathrash", taking elements from both Death Metal and Thrash Metal. Many of the songs are quite groove orientated, and also offer a melodic side. Influences range from old-school to a more modern Death/Thrash metal sound. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Wretched+End">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
