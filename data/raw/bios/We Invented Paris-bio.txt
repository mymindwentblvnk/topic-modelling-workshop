We Invented Paris is a European artist collective - a pool of musicians and friends who constantly “re-invent” their subtly arranged Indie-Pop-Songs in ever-changing instrumentation. The collective came together in mid-2010; surprising for their short existence: they already have an impressive concert-history. Within one year We Invented Paris played over 70 shows in more than 50 cities. Amongst others they supported Kettcar, Octoberman and The Pains of Being Pure at Heart. 

The “project” does not only include musicians but also other creatively-active heads beyond the circle of fifths. From web appearances and merchandising through to stage design the collective members make everything on their own. Not surprisingly the band releases their records on their own label “Spectacular Spectacular”. Even the tour booking and organisation is still part of the band’s daily business. They did an entire tour last year using with the help of “Couch Surfing” (www.couchsurfing.org) – travelling through living rooms and kitchens with the goal of exploring abandoned backyards, house boats and cosy bars all over Europe.

We Invented Paris mix up traditional instrumentation with electronic elements and live they often transform sentimental songs into danceable artefacts. 'Melancholic Joy of Life' someone said - which might be the best way to capture the aura of We Invented Paris. The producers of TV Noir, a popular German music show, also recognized the beauty in their songs and invited the inventors of Paris into their live show in Berlin.

We Invented Paris are currently (and most of the time) on the road. Their debut album released on November 4th, 2011.
