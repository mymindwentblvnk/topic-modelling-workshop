American Wrestlers is an American indie rock band from St. Louis, Missouri, United States, formed in 2014. Initially founded as a solo project by Scottish musician Gary McClure, the band also includes Bridgette Imperial, Ian Reitz and Josh Van Hoorebeke.

Following the break-up of his band, Working for a Nuclear Free City, and the release of his debut solo album, Wreaths (2013), McLure moved from Manchester, England to St. Louis, Missouri to marry his then-girlfriend, Bridgette Imperial. McClure subsequently recorded American Wrestler's self-titled debut at the couple's home, on an eight-track Tascam recorder.

American Wrestlers was initially released for free on BandCamp. After receiving attention from various music blogs and websites, Fat Possum Records re-released the album in 2015. Following the release of the album, McClure assembled a band, including Imperial on keyboard and rhythm guitar, bassist Ian Reitz, and drummer Josh Van Hoorebeke. 

On November 4, 2016 the band released its second studio album, Goodbye Terrible Youth.
