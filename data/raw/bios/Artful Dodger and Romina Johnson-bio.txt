Artful Dodger is a British R&B & UK Garage band from the city of Southampton, who became famous through their 2Step hits and gave Craig David's career a boost after he appeared on their #2 hit "Rewind" in December 1999. The band's name was apparently stolen from an unknown bedroom DJ (popular on pirate radio stations) Lee Haynes whose father's name was Roger, which was inspired by the Artful Dodger, a character in the Charles Dickens novel Oliver Twist. The band originally consisted of Mark Hill and Pete Devereux, but Devereux left prior to the release of the single "TwentyFourSeven", and Hill continued from then on to produce records under the Artful Dodger moniker by himself.

Romina Johnson (born 1973) is a London-based singer. She was the vocalist on "Movin' Too Fast" by The Artful Dodger. She was born in Rome to an American father and an Italian mother. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Artful+Dodger+and+Romina+Johnson">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
