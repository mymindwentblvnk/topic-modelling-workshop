Wolfmangler is a project formed in 2004 in Texas by D. Smolken who is now based in Krak√≥w, Poland.

It is a combination of acoustic drone and doom with black ambient and neofolk.
Most of their works are rearrangements of popular music from jazz to children's songs. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wolfmangler">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
