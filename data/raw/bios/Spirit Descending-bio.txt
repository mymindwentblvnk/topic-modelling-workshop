Emerging from several towns and cities in the valley of Central California, these musicians have come together to become Spirit Descending. A taste of Goth and Metal combined, mixed with Operatic melodies and an experimental Rock flare, they come together to create a new sound for the local repertoire. With each band member coming from different backgrounds and influenced by all sorts of bands and genres, rehearsals have become more of an experiment and an adventure each week. The idea of the band came together when Erik (drums) and Elaine (guitar), formerly of Gnostic Envy, decided to start a new project. The two had been playing together for quite some time, and didn't want to give up on playing, even after their former band had separated. They weren't sure what they were looking for, and sought out different vocalists to start at the base of a new group. In December 2008, they called in Krys, a classical soprano vocalist, who was new to the metal scene.
They later found newcomer Matt for the bass spot and after one meeting, the quartet decided to give it a shot. Rehearsals started and went on for several weeks, piecing together old songs, or messing around with new tunes to make new ones on the hunt for the the unique sound to fit their styles. It wasn't long after that the band discovered the talent of the Keyboardist, Amanda, filling in the songs with her expertise on the keys, using the piano and other effects to make the sound darker, and more haunting, coming even closer to the sound they've all been looking for.
