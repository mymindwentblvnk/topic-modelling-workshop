The whole Bright Curse story starts in June 2012 in London when, after an improvised jam led by LSD, sadness, and anger, at a good friendâ€™s going away party, Singer/Guitarist Romain, Drummer Zach and Bassist Sammy decided to write some real heavy shit!

The first self-titled album was composed and recorded that same summer of 2012, co-produced by JB Pilon.

8 months after the recording Sammy left the band and was replaced by that same JB Pilon on the bass in March 2013.
All the musicians are French, but living in London, they like to think that they are citizens of the world.

All songs are based on dynamics and contrasts, on life and death, because after all, Life is a Bright Curse, you don't choose to live, or to die.

In April, they signed a deal with Bilocation records for a limited vinyl edition release of their first Ep.

The band is now composing new songs, looking for gigs and writing their history, hopefully they will write the story with you. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bright+Curse">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
