The Black Stymphalian was created in late 2006 by Jaymz Stephenson as a solo project to express and explore his diverse tastes in music. This ranged from Thrash, progressive to industrial Style sounds.

In early 2007 the first Stymphalian track was written, entitled "Falling into Darkness", with the help of Richard Dowson on vocals. The song was produced and recorded in Jaymz' bedroom studio. It was during this recording that Jaymz realised he was keen to take his previous recording experience to a more serious level.

The new EP “Digression” features 5 different singers from all over the world, ranging from Middlesbrough UK to Geelong Australia. Each singer brings their own unique style to each song.

The EP will be available to buy from all the popular digital distributers such as iTunes, Amazon etc very shortly along with an online store where you can purchase the physical CD. Look out for the updates which will be announced on this page! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Black+Stymphalian">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
