Medications released their first self titled EP on Dischord records creating their own blend of math rock, post-punk and indie rock. Their first full-length album, "Your Favorite People All in One Place," was released on Dischord in early 2005. Devin Ocampo sings and plays guitar, Chad Molter plays bass, and Andrew Becker plays the drums. 

Devin and Chad were part of another band on Dischord called Faraquet, which gained a significant cult following in the math rock scene. Devin also played drums in Smart Went Crazy and currently does so with Mary Timony (along with Chad on bass).
