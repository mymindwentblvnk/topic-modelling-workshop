Anne Garner, middle child of five, was born in Burnley, England, near the home of the Pendle Witches. Raised in rainy Glossop at the end of the Snake Pass, she grew up in the magical Derbyshire countryside, head in the clouds. Fascinated by little insects and night owls, she loved to pick wimberries on the moors, draw flowers and birds and roam the nearby woods.

Her family moved to Sheffield, a hotbed of musical and artistic counter-culture, when she was in her early teens. As she grew into adulthood Anne began to paint, compose, perform, allow music and art to carry her through life. The loss of her mother to cancer, while devastating, allowed the discovery of a new focus and confidence. After singing at the funeral she resolved to dedicate herself to songwriting.

Ensuing associations with Richard H Kirk, Mixmaster Morris, The Big Chill, Dollboy and Animat culminated in a collection of her songs, Remaking the Pearl, receiving electronic re-workings in 2005. One remixer, The Pylon King, went on to produce her 2006 album Magic & Madness. Later that year Anne moved to London where she established The Daylight Music Festival and began her long-term collaboration with experimental music producer James Murray.

The recently released, critically acclaimed Trusting a Twirled World weaves folk, electronica and classical threads into something altogether new. Anne is now enjoying increasing support from established artists, radio presenters and DJs, and her work has been favourably likened to that of Kate Bush, Anja Garbarek and Joanna Newsom. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Anne+Garner">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
