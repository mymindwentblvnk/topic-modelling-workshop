Edge of Thorns hail from the Bitburg/Trier area and were established in 1996. Founders include Duke Schmitt (guitarist/songwriter at the time) Hani Schütz as well as  Lothar Krämer on keyboards and Olli Brück on bass.  

1998 brought a line up change with the addition of Achim Sinzinger and Dave Brxius, shifting the band's sound toward the guitars due to their new, different influences.  More value was put on  harmony with such songs  as Riders of the Storm, Beyond Horizons and also Carpe diem.

Oliver Brück left the band in  2003 for other interests and  Achim took over his bass duties in the middle of 2004. Lothar left soon after and was replaced by temporary keyboardist Markus Olk.  In the middle of 2007 Achim switched back to guitar with the recruitment of Julian Longer on bass.  

The current line up for 2008 seems to be the most solid and creative since the bands conception. With the release of  the critically acclaimed Album Masquerading of the Wicked (2007) the german metal band are among the best Germany has to offer.
