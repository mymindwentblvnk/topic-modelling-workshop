DarknessEternal is a one-man band from the Netherlands and was brought to life somewhere in the summer of 2008. During a period of 6 months a total of 5 albums have been unleashed upon mankind. These albums consist out of 2 Demo's (The Neverending War against Pedoism and Faggotry 2008 / Faggot Funeral 2008) 2 EP's (PedoShredder 2009 / Bleakness 2009) and 1 Full-Length album that goes by the name of Raging Blizzard of Hatred (2009). DarknessEternal plays strictly Nihilistic Suicidal Distorted Anti-Pedo Black Metal in a raw and primitive way. Lyricly it deals with issues such as Misanthrophy, Depression, Melancholy, Suicide, War, Anti-Pedoism, Hatred and Anti-Religion. A compilation/best off album shall find it's release somewhere in April 2009. After that there are no further albums planned thus far.
