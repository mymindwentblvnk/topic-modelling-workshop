Formed and led by Leenus Livingstone, METALLOID is a brand new Heavy Metal Band hailing from the East Midlands, England. The band was formed with a vision unique with its music and attitude, a sole intention to inspire the world and to bring a positive outlook towards life in this chaotic and challenging age we live in. The Music is a powerful mix of Power, Progressive and Thrash Genres of Metal. 

Originally formed in 2007, METALLOID has earned impressionable success with an ever growing fan base in the UK. Having been around for only a short period of time roughly over an year and having performed 21 Gigs at the time, the band went on to play the UK's Premier Metal Festival Bloodstock Open Air in August 2008 after having deservedly won Bloodstock's First Ever Metal To The Masses Competition for Unsigned Bands in the UK. 

With Leenus Livingstone on the Lead Guitar, Pete Morten on Lead Vocals, Robert Tallant on the Rhythm Guitar, Dan Bigland on the Bass and Morgan Pettigrew on the Drums, METALLOID are currently recording their First E.P. and are now back on the road touring. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Metalloid">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
