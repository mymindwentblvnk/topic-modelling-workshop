Funera is a project from Orangeville, Ontario, Canada.
Formed as a one man band in 2006, progressed from blackened funeral doom, to dark ambient with touches of noise, power electronics and death industrial.
Released the demo "Beyond the Mirror of Life's Illusion" in 2007. After that, the project was on hold for 3 years while various material was being worked on. In 2011 the project changed name to The Anti-Genesis of Funeriasis. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Funera">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
