Tephra was a band from Braunschweig, Germany that founded in the end of 2003. Before they formed Tephra, all the members played in various musically quite diverse local bands. This influences the band in many different ways. Tephra has developed a unique atmospheric sludge metal sound stemming from many different sources of inspiration.

In March 2007 they once again entered the studio to record their sophomore album, entitled A Modicum Of Truth. It was released in October 2007 on Riptide Recordings.

At the end of 2008 they went back to being a four-piece, due to the job related departure of their keyboard player.
