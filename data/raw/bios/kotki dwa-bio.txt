Kotki Dwa are a three-piece band hailing from the green pastures of Milton Keynes and Aylesbury, in England consisting of Alex Ostrowski, his younger brother Tristan and Tom Walker. They write and play pretty little songs that make the hair tingle. The sound they create is akin to a man and his robot playing a loving trio with a jukebox.

In 2005 they released their debut album "Nostonesthrow" and their "Youwantfromsky" EP. Then in 2007 they released their second album Onlyyouarenotsleeping and their debut single Robin's Clogs. It was their first proper release, all prior to it were home-made. 

The track "Le Beau Charcutier" won the Tate Gallery Music & Art Competition, a major online competition in which 16-24-year-olds created music inspired by art from the Tate Collection. 

A new EP has since been announced titled 'Lunch' which is due for release on 14th Novemeber <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kotki+Dwa">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
