Sam and the Womp are a British based eight piece music group who formed in 2009 and have created a unique alternative disco sound. Their music mixes traditional elements of Balkan music and Jamaican ska with modern electronic and dance elements. The band also have their own dance named, the "Womp", which is fairly idiosyncratic and uninhibited. Their music has been largely popularised by BBC Radio 1 with a heavy promotion of their single "Bom Bom". They released their debut single "Bom Bom" on iTunes on 19 August 2012 and the single went to the number one spot in the UK midweek charts and are firmly positioned for a first week number one. As of 2012 they are signed to Stiff Records, a record label rooted in the modern indie scene.

The band's first single "Bom Bom" was released in August 2012 and features a euphoric and light hearted sound which seems to have universal appeal. The lead singer on the track is Bloem de Ligny who is also a solo artist. Other members of the band to feature on the track include band creator Sam Ritchie, who plays trumpet on the track and Aaron Horn who features as DJ and producer. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sam+and+the+Womp">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
