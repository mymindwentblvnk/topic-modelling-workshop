Sutratma are a funeral doom band from California, formed for the love of the genre. Starting at the end of 2010 Sutratma quickly solidified a line up of Martin Ayala - drums, James Petrucci - bass, Brent Woodward - Guitar, Denver Dale - vocals/lyrics and Adi Tejada - on Guitar/keyboard programming.  Casey Shropshire (ex. Uphill Battle, Monotremata) has since replaced Woodward as guitarist.

Sutratma are pushing their sound into a physic other realm using funeral doom as the general template. Within a year of forming they are putting the finishing touches on 5 songs that were recorded for a debut release. 

In 2019, Casey Shropshire, James Petrucci, and Gavino Sanchez left the band.  They were replaced by Terry Luna on guitar and Kevin Torres on drums.
