MyGrain is a modern melodic death metal band from Helsinki, Finland, formed in 2004 and disbanded in 2015.

The band was formed in the summer of 2004, when vocalist Tommy, and guitarists Resistor and Matthew, remnants of then defunct New Science Band started over with the aim of playing some rough, yet melodic metal. Drummer DJ Locomotive, keyboardist Eve and bassist Jonas soon joined the band's line-up. Matthew and Resistor were replaced by Mr. Downhill and Joni Lahdenkauppi in 2008 and 2013 respectively.

In the years of its existence, MyGrain released four full-length albums, "Orbit Dance" (2006), "Signs of Existence" (2008), "MyGrain" (2011) and "Planetary Breathing"(2013), as well as two demos. Their full-length albums were released through Spinefarm Records.

On April 2nd 2015 it was announced that, in mutual agreement, the members decided to put MyGrain to rest. The band played its last concert on May 8th 2015, in Helsinki. And again reunited in 2018
