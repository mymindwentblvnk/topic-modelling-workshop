Romanticizing rape, torture, and cannibalism since 2007, Paroxysmal Butchering consistently delivers slamming, guttural sickness, exemplifying the essence of Brutal Death Metal, while incorporating elements of Grindcore and Black Death into a full scale aural fist fuck of blasting perversity. 

Churning out misanthropic disgust from the festering bowels of Southern California, Paroxysmal Butchering has worked hard to establish a loyal fan base, worldwide, and create music that is both ferocious and unyielding, yet memorable. As a band, Paroxysmal Butchering continues to assert itself as THE premier purveyor of ear drum punishing, genital obliterating brutality. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Paroxysmal+Butchering">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
