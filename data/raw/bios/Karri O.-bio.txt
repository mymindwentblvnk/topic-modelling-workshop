Karri Ojanen started producing music with a friend of his on a pair of Commodore Amigas in 1992. Since then this preoccupation has led him in many directions, including event promotion and vinyl vending. Over the years he's played at clubs and parties around the world, from Detroit to Toronto to Berlin to St. Petersburg to Tokyo.

Originally from Helsinki, Finland, Karri O. moved to Toronto, Canada in 2007. He concentrates on producing his own distinctive style of minimal techno and microhouse, the ultimate goal still being to fill the dancefloor. He has several releases out now or coming soon on labels including Plong!, Resopal, Statik Entertainment, Toys for Boys and Lebensfreude. Karri is the owner of the audio-visual label Abflug. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Karri+O.">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
