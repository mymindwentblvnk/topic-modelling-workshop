There is more than one artist called Constellation.

1) Hardcore band from Ukraine. 
2) 70s American hard rock group.
3) American hip hop group, consisting of three members: Born Talent, DJ Mugzy, Jay Love.

Originally from Chattanooga, Tennessee, the band featured a potential superstar in the form of 14 year old singer/guitarist Punkin Crye and brothers Buster and Mike Visage (bass and drums respectively).  The trio attracted a loyal following on the local club scene, eventually capturing the attention of the small Tennessee-based Pyramid label, which signed them to a recording contract and financed their self-titled 1978 debut.  Co-produced by Jack Bryson, Cathy Dover, Jim Stabile and the band, "Constellation" is a pretty amazing effort; even more so given creative mainstay Crye wasn't even old enough to legally play in a nightclub.  In addition to handling lead vocals (he sure didn't sound like a 14 year old) and lead guitar, Crye wrote or co-wrote all nine tracks. 

Unfortunately, the album did little commercially and the band promptly called it quits.  Crye relocated to L.A. where he enjoyed minor success playing in a number of local metal bands.  Unfortunately, Crye also picked up a nasty drug habit.  By the time he was in his early 20s he'd returned to Tennessee where he ended up homeless, living on the streets of Chattanooga.   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Constellation">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
