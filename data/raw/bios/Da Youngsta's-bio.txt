Da Youngstas is a hip-hop trio consisting of two brothers, Taji "Taj Mahal" Goodman and Qu'ran Goodman, and their cousin Tarik Dawson, hailing from Philadelphia.

Similar to Shyheim (aka The Rugged Child), Da Youngsta's were the definition of raw talent back in 1993. However unlike shyheim who carried on as a Wu Affiliate, Da Youngsta's disappeared into thin air, shortly after their last album "I'll make you famous" dropped. It's such a shame, as Taji, Qur'an & Tarik were some of Philly's best MC's regardless of their age. However unlike Shyheim who was a bit younger than Da Youngsta's (11 years old!), each and every MC does not carry that young/adolescent sound that can clearly give away age and turn away some listeners, infact, their voices are some of the roughest and hardest I've ever heard!. Which makes you wonder, are these really teenagers? To add to their hard-hitting sound & ruff flows, The aftermath comes equipped with nothing less than strict Hiphop legends on board for the ride: DJ Premier, Pete Rock, Marley Marl & The beatnuts! who each do their thing, for the talented youngsta's. This emphasises just how much potential these guys were showing, as legends like these don't just do tracks with anybody. Even though every track is worth listening to, I'd have to say that "It'z Natural" produced by The beatnuts, "Who's The Mic Wrecka" produced by Pete Rock & "Crewz Pop" produced by 118th Street are the standouts, being complete 1993 classics that showcase just why Da Youngsta's were the best teenagers the hiphop world had ever seen. Without a doubt, this album is historic... fans of that rough & rugged sound /top notch production will love "the Aftermath". A Must for all fans of Early 90's hiphop, where talent & creativity was at its peak. GET THIS. PEACE
