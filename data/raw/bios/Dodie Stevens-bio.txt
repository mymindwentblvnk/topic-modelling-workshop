Dodie Stevens, (born Geraldine Ann Pasquale, 17 February 1946, Chicago, Illinois), was a singing prodigy at the age of  four. By the time she was seven she began making local television appearances, and in 1959, at age thirteen, she had the #1 hit, gold record “Pink Shoelaces”.

While still in high school, Dodie’s career skyrocketed.  She appeared on Dick Clark’s American Bandstand and starred with Fabian in her first film, “Hound Dog Man”.  She continued to record a string of singles and albums, and more television guest appearances followed, including Bob Hope’s weekly television show.  Dodie also toured worldwide with Fabian, Frankie Avalon, Paul Anka, Bobby Rydell and many more teen idols from that era.
