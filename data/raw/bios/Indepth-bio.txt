As we gear up for the upcoming festival season...                             
                                                                               
 ...Spiral Trax is extremely proud to present a row of more techno influenced releases.                                                                     
                                                                               
 First out is Indepth from Israel who, even though he had two previous album   
 releases, is a newcomer to Spiral Trax. As we laid our hands on a five track  
 demo some time ago we realized that 25 year old Shahar Melamed from Haifa is  
 heading down the same musical path that we have been walking for some time    
 now.                                                                          
                                                                               
 Even though Zero Sum is his third album release it is a release that is       
 re-defining his musical style. Throughout the years Shahar has moved from     
 progressive to breaks to techno, all with a little pinch of psychedelia and a 
 hefty dose of clubby influences. The new album is a blend of banging techno,  
 minimal, acid and electro. Holding a five-year residency at Luna Club,        
 northern Israel's leading dance venue, and numerous gigs abroad has definitely
 taught Shahar how to work the floor.
