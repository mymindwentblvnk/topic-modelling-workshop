The Puritan was a Finnish drone/doom group formed in 2005, that consisted of Sami Hynninen (Albert Witchfinder) from Reverend Bizarre and members from Sinisthra. Often labeled without "The" and thus confused with atleast two other bands (see Puritan), which page you can also find their album "Lithium Gates" listed on. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Puritan">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
