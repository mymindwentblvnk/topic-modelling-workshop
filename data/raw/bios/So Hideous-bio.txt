So Hideous...formed in 2008 with the intention to make soundtracks for films that have yet to exist. Throat searing chamber music. An orchestra of guitars, bass, drum and boss pedals. Fusing elements of ambient, post rock, hardcore, black metal and neo-classical to craft a wholly unique, intense experience. To help achieve an immense and ornate sound the collective augments their studio recordings with the expanded instrumentation of strings, pianos and vocalists.
