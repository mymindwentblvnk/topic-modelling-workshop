* Voldemort (aka Voldemort - Wizard Metal) is Europe's first and loudest Wizard Rock-band (a growing movement of different kinds of rock groups singing about the Harry Potter-series). In February 2007 they released an EP called 'Evil is Sexy' in the Wizard Rock EP of the Month Club (see http://www.wizardrockclub.com for details).

* Voldemort is a Finnish dumblecore band (grindcore/death/black/hardcore with a scent of Harry Potter). The band was founded in the spring 2006. Voldemort's production is a one big joke, and no-one should take it seriously. www.myspace.com/voldemortgind <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Voldemort">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
