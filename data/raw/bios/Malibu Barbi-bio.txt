An all-girl Metal band from San Francisco, Malibu Barbi were fronted by Chastain vocalist Leather Leone and issued a 12" single, dubbed the 'Rude Girls' EP, during 1987. 
The original formation comprised singer Steve Gelardi, guitarists Heidi Hansen and Heidi Furr, bassist Jo Ann Rebel and drummer Sandy Sledge, the latter ex-Rude Girl. 
Membership changes subsequently saw Furr usurped by Leather Angel's Debbie Wolf. 
The EP, notably engineered and mixed by Sylvia Massy-Shivy, later to score platinum success with artists such as Tool and System of a Down, would be recorded by Sledge, Rebel, Hansen, alongside sessioneers ex-Rude Girl vocalist Leather Leone with erstwhile Rude Girl guitarist Lois LaRue putting down guest lead work on the track 'Lords Of The Night'.

Leone, Wolf and Lois LaRue left the group later in the year. Drawing in new guitar player Cara Crash the band took a musical diversion away from the Power Metal styled EP, announcing plans to release an album tentatively titled 'Malibu Barbi Welcomes You To The Psychotic School For Dead Girls'. Sandy Sledge would go on to form Warbride.
