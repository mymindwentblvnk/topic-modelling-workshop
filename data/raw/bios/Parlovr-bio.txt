PARLOVR are three ones born in a Parc Extension loft of that name in the late months of 2005. Two errant songwriters on either end of the ring and a mesmerizing electronic artist-cum-referee standing in the middle come together to mash orchestral pop, punk and dark dance to make their own brand of heavy-hearted sloppy pop. Perhaps weird, they dance on reverb and puzzle each other with their vein-bursting off-key singing and off-kilter songs. Few mutual tastes, though a shared ear for honesty. Likened to nothing, but sound like something. Intentionally tinny, but not self-deprecating. Exploding with minimalism. Without fail, enjoying things however they may be.
