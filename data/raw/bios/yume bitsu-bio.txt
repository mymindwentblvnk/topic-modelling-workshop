Yume Bitsu (meaning "dream beats" in Japanese), is a psychedelic rock band. Most of the band members live along the Pacific Coast in California and Oregon. Vocalist/guitarist Adam Forkner is active as White Rainbow and is also part of Surface of Eceon, a supergroup that also features members of Landing, an ambient, psychedelic rock unit and has moonlighted as a guitarist for Devendra Banhart and Jackie-O Motherfucker.

According to Forkner, the band's name is pronounced "YOU may BEET suu."
