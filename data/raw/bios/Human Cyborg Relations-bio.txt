This bands name has now been changed to Otoño

Human Cyborg Relations is a 3-man band based in a small town in Hollister, California. Our sound is inspired from different genres of music ranging from metal to classical… and snippets of everything in between. We do not wish to limit our music by classifying it into one specific genre alone which is why our music can only be described as a fusion of various musical influences.
