With a rich Cameroonian background and from on the Southside of Atlanta, emerged the amazing talent of Denzel "ForteBowie‚Äù Ayuk. Born in 1990, ForteBowie taught himself to master fruity loops on his laptop and the keys on a piano in his teen years. Then, after being a student of numerous genres, he began to embark on a journey as an artist. Influenced by the styles of artists such as Sade, Phil Collins, Sting, Outkast, and many others, Forte mixes all of his influences with his own flavor and curates works of art.

ForteBowie signed himself to his independent label 1990, inking the deal in December 2011. A multitalented musician who can play numerous instruments and is an extraordinary songwriter/producer/vocalist/rhyming circuit of his hometown, Forte has been making his mark in different cities for the past year.

After releasing his first project on March 1, 2011, entitled UberEargasms: The Life & Times of David Ruffin Jr., Forte gained some attention from music fans online but not enough to capture the attention of the tastemakers and big media outlets.

By of July 2011, ForteBowie released his Something About #Bowie project through Refined Hype and attracted the likes of Dj Booth.net, The Smoking Section, Ashley Outrageous, The Fader Magazine, and many others. With undeniable records like Ratchet, Impala, and Decatur the project landed a spot on Live Mixtapes in the Indy section getting a very good score without a DJ. Something About #Bowie included a few notable underground artists such as, Aleon Craft, Stanza, and Dave Flyer.

In 2012, everyone can look forward to ForteBowie's third forthcoming assessment entitled Passion & Confusion due in April and the rise of an amazing and well deserved artist.
