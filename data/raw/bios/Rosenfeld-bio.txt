1) Thrash metal act from Tokyo, Japan, formed in November 1986. Rosenfeld features vocalist/frontman Hisayoshi Hiraga as the only permanent member. In 1986 the band started out with Yasuhiro Kamei (gt), Hajime Morii (b) & Takafumi Segawa (ds). In December 1987 Kamei left the band and Rosenfeld's activities were put on hold. As a result Hisayoshi joined ＡＩＯＮ in January 1988, playing his first gig with the band on March 13th. In June 1989 he leaves the band to restart Rosenfeld, and he does so with Youichi Horizoe on guitar as a replacement for Kamei. They released two albums: "Pigs of the Empire" in 1991 and live album "In the Garden" in 1994. They also made four demo tapes across their career "Rosenfeld", "B", "Ashes to Ashes" and "demo '93".

A few member changes follow in the early 90's:
July 1990: Gish (Rapes) replaces Morii on bass & Kouichi (Rapes) replaces Segawa on drums
January 1991: Hiromi joins on guitar to become a five piece, twin guitar, band
March 1992: Hiromi and Gish leave the band after 'The God's Truth' compilation is released (3.16)
October 1992: Takami (Bellzlleb, Salamander) replaces Gish on bass and Shinji (Guilty Vice, Snaggle Tooth) replaces Hiromi on guitar

The band split-up in March 1993 due to personal difficulties. In the meantime Hisayoshi starts his new project called Skull Crusher. Rosenfeld regroups for the last time in October with Takashi Kinoshita replacing Takami on Bass and Hirofumi Ozawa replacing Kouichi on Drums so they can hold their last gigs with the final being on December 23rd 1993. But then, in 2008, the band reunited.

Among several other Japanese thrash metal bands like Rommel and Harkenkreuz, Rosenfeld had a Nazi-image. They wrote lyrics about Nazism and POW's. Rosenfeld used the imagery for shock value.
