Formed in the dark end of 2007 in Aberdeen, Scotland, Thrashist Regime have honed their brand of melodic thrash into a fine art and are renowned for their energetic live shows. Terroriser wrote of debut album 'Fearful Symmetry': "Great promise runs simultaneously across well-written and memorable songs, led by the snarls of frontman Joe Johnston and backed by contagious riffs that transition into balls-out shredding. 'Fearful Symmetry' is sure to establish them as a cog in the wheel that continues to turn younger generations on to the genre." Follow-up album 'Carnival of Monsters' is due to drop in Spring 2018.
