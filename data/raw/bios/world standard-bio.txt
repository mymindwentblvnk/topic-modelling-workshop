World Standard is sort of an homage to world music excursions. Sohichiro Suzuki is the man behind the project. Haruomi Hosono (formerly of Yellow Magic Orchestra) often collaborates and/or produces.
Lately Sohichiro Suzuki has been collaborating as part of an old style music ensemble called "Noahlewis' Mahlon Taits".
World Standard have collaborated with many artists such as Wechsel Garland, Kama Aina, The Hand and Moose Hill.
