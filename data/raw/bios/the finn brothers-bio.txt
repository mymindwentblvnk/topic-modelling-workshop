The Finn Brothers is the name of the musical project of New Zealand brothers Neil and Tim Finn.

The brothers started off making music together from a very young age, and Neil joined his big brother Tim in Split Enz at the age of eighteen. Both brothers have been involved in complicated music careers after Split Enz was disbanded in 1984. Neil started his own band, Crowded House and subsequently recorded two solo albums after Crowded House split in 1996. He reformed Crowded House in 2007 with a subsequent album and tour. Tim started a solo-career in 1983 before Split Enz disbanded and temporarily joined Crowded House for the Woodface album in 1991.

Both brothers were awarded the OBE in June 1993 for their contribution to New Zealand music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/The+Finn+Brothers">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
