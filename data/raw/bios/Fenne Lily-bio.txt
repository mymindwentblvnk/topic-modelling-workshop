Fenne Lily is a British singer-songwriter based in Bristol.

Being discouraged from watching TV as a child was integral to the development of Fenne Lily's musicality, as instead much of her time was spent writing songs and honing both instrumental and understatement in equal measures.

At the age of 17 she began travelling to Bristol from her home in Dorset, and within a year found herself suporting the likes of Marika Hackman, Marlon Williams, KT Tunstall, C Duncan, and Palace, among many more. Soon after she self-released her debut single 'Top to Toe' - a song she had written when she was only 15 - which aling with her next two singles amassed over 20 million streams in the next 18 months.

A prolific artist, she soon found herself collaborating with a number of other musicians, including Aldous Harding and fellow Bristolians Tamu Massif & Oliver Wilde.

Throughout this whole time however, she has been writing for her own songs. Enlisting some musical friends to join her and recording with one foot on the Isle of Wight and one in Bristol, Fenne completed her debut album due in 2018.
