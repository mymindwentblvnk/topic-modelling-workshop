MALIGNER are a deathrashing power-trio from the Malm√∂ area. The band was initiated by Aztiak and Ertheb, both of Latin American origin, when a mutual friend introduced them to each other to organize a show for Chilean death metal legends Sadism. After a few months of rehearsing and writing material, they were finally joined by bass-player (and soon-to-be vocalist) Maligno. The band was complete, songs finalized, and the demo recorded. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Maligner">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
