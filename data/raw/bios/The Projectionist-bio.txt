The Projectionist are a Cambridgeshire UK based 4-piece hardcore/metal band.

Blending an energetic mix of hardcore and metal, The Projectionist are a no-holds-barred sonic attack that cuts a path straight through your ears and into the deepest regions of your bowels.
Like English weather, their music is changeable, tinged with hope followed by misery, tongues planted firmly in cheek.

“Mixing discordant hardcore with thick, violent riffs that wouldn’t be out of place on the soundtrack to some vicious horror movie, the quartet have just released their debut EP ‘Meat Parade’. And it’s killer. Get on them if you want something you can use to weird out everyone in the immediate vicinity when they’re pissing you off.”

“The Projectionist wanted to set a high bar for themselves with their first EP, Meat Parade. It totally slays from the get go…there’s melody, angst, grind, breakdowns, violence and strong builds. Seriously now, is there anything else you could possibly want? If you’re looking for something challenging and interesting, then this is it.”
