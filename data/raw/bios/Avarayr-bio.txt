Avarayr was formed by Narek Avedyan, formerly of Symphony Of Silence, after it disbanded in 2013. The genre is focused on Atmospheric themes and passages mixed with the cold bitterness of Black Metal, with lyrical content covering a wide variety of subjects. This is an Iranian-Armenian band. The members are of Armenian ethnicity which provides them with the ability to inject Armenian folk songs into their music, as well as hints of Persian folk music. Band members are Narek (who handles keyboards, guitars, vocals), Emin (who handles guitars) and Ervin (who handles drums and percussive instruments).
