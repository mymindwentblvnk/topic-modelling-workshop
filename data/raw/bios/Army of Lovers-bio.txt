They re-formed to release 'Les Greatest Hits' in 1996, De La Cour did not want to be in the group anymore so original member La Camilla was asked back and she returned to record 4 new songs with the group.

12 years after their last compilation album "Le Grand Docu-Soap", the reunited Swedish theatro-pop group releases a brand new greatest hits collection, plus 4 brand new songs ("Rockin' the ride", "Crashing down", "Signed on my tattoo" and "Tragedy").

Their name alludes to a documentary Armee der Liebenden oder Revolte der Perversen (Army of Lovers or Revolution of the Perverts) about Rosa von Praunheim, which in turn alludes to the Theban Band. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Army+of+Lovers">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
