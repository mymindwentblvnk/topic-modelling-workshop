history:
Matthias wanted to try something new in his early music career and he contacted Andy, because he recently started to play the drum. They both agreed to start a hard rock band.
After a few months of searching appropriate members the positions on the bass and the 2nd guitar were filled in by Annelise and Frederik respectively. The vocal section was also handed to Matthias.
At the beginning of May 2008 Andy left the band due to differences with other members...
A few weeks later a guy named Peter applied for the position of drummer. The first rehearsal together he convinced us of his skills and he became the new member of the band. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Seed+Of+Rock">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
