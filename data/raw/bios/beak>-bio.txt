Beak> is a project of Geoff Barrow (of Portishead) with fellow Bristol musicians Billy Fuller (Fuzz Against Junk) and Matt Williams (Team Brick / MXLX). Their self-titled debut was released in November 2009 on Barrow's own label, Invada Records.

In contrast to Barrow's perfectionism when creating music with Portishead, Beak>'s debut was recorded live in one room with no overdubs or repair, only using edits to create arrangements. All tracks were written over a twelve-day session in Bristol, England.

In 2016 Beak> scored the soundtrack for the film Couple in a Hole.
