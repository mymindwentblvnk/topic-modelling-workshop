1) Necromance is a Traditional/Melodic Metal band from Allentown, Pennsylvania, USA - formed in September 2004. The band was formed by siblings Jeff (Guitars) and Sarah (Vocals) Teets, along with good friend Kaling Schweizerhof on drums. Kalin has come and gone from the band a few times over the course of their history, but is currently in the line-up. Over the course of their 6-year history the band has opened for national acts such as Jon Oliva's Pain, Circle II Circle, Overkill, Raven, George Lynch (ex-Dokken), Manticora, and Attacker. In the fall of 2008 they won studio time by beating out 18 other bands, and the CD that came as a result, entitled Never Look Back was released independently in April 2009. The CD reserved very favorable reviews from various metal websites and organizations, though the band has cited dissatisfaction with several aspects of the release. After their third period of down-time the band is currently seeking a new bassist to replace long-standing member Chad Hontz, working on a lot of brand new music, and ready to get back into the music scene.
