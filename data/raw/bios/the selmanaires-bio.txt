Influenced by the sounds of myriad cultures and eras, The Selmanaires play a musical collage that dances the border between tradition and experiment. Formed in 2003 on Selman Street, Atlanta, Georgia, by Herb Harris, Jason Harris, and Tommy Chung, the group expanded to a four piece, first with Mathis Hunter on guitar and percussion, and in 2008 Mario Schambon on percussion. Their dynamic is based on a mutual love of the hyptnotic sounds of Can & Kraftwerk, Brazilian Bossa & Tropicalia, and 60's pop from all around the globe.
  The Selmanaires first show was in 2003 at a house party in Atlanta. After a few years of building a local following, they began touring the country in 2006. In 2007, The Selmanaires embarked on a national tour with hometown friends The Black Lips. On their most recent tour with Broadcast and Atlas Sound in October/November 2009, they pulled double duty, performing both as The Selmanaires and also as backing band for Bradford Cox as Atlas Sound. They continue to tour and have also performed shows with Wire, Pylon, Deerhunter, Tussle, and The Ettes.
  Their latest album, Tempo Temporal, was self-released in humble form in October 2009. Engineered & mixed by Mike Wright (Black Lips) & Graham Marsh (Cee-Lo), on the outside it is a sonic departure from the previous recordings, but the essence of the band's off-kilter approach to pop music remains. After two albums and a handful of singles the band is defining a sound of their own, and the songs on Tempo Temporal move closer to a cohesive vision of the present in relation to the past and the future. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Selmanaires">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
