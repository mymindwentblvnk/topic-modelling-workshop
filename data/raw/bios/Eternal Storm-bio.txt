Eternal Storm is a Melodic Extreme Metal band that was created in 2006 under the name of Death Valley by Kheryon (vocals) and Tephros (drums, ex-Beneath Your Fears) along with another musicians. The band started playing some kind of symphonic black metal but they went into a hiatus shortly.

Some time after, in late 2007, Kheryon (now playing bass too) and Tephros reformed Death Valley and brought Daniel Maganto as guitarist. After a few rehearsals Daniel invited his friend Winterwolf to join as second guitarist: now the line-up was complete, so they started writing music in the vein of old school melodic death metal with some black metal touches and other traces of their own, blending aggression with melodic guitar work and epic riffs as well as atmospheric nuances. Tephros left the band some time after because of time issues with his degree. The band spent a short period as a trio and then a couple of months jamming with Carlos Gumuzio (currently in The Descent), who would eventually leave the band in order to have more time in his other projects as a vocalist. 

During mid 2009 Death Valley changed his name to Eternal Storm just before recording their first songs: the new name shows the progression in the band's style and concept. In October 2009, Ramón Mejías de Salas joined Eternal Storm and the quartet started to perform their first shows. After some difficult times which followed Ramon's departure, it was during July 2011 when Luis "Lucho" Rodríguez from the almighty progressive metalheads Distance closed the lineup and their debut EP is set for 2013.

Kheryon - Vocals/Bass (2006-)
Jaime Torres - Guitar (2008-)
