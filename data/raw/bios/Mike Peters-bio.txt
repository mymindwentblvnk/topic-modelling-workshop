Mike Peters first rose to prominence in the mid-80s as lead singer of the Welsh band The Alarm, leaving that group in 1991 to begin a solo career.  After the infamous Brixton academy gig, he retreated to a small church in North Wales to write new material for his solo career. Over a year later he emerged, refreshed, and contacted The Alarm's fan club. He then went on tour and funded his own fan club, The MPO (Mike Peters organization), he hasn't looked back since. In 1992 he held The Gathering, a weekend long gig held in his hometown Rhyl. The Gathering is now in it's 14th year in Llandudno (a bigger venue!). His first album ‘Breathe’ was an underground success. It was then that he was diagnosed with Non- Hodgkin’s Lymphatic Cancer. He kept this a secret from his fans and carried on with the tour. After the tour, he went back to his doctors and all were amazed to find his cancer had gone into recession. Fuelled by inspiration he wrote and recorded 'Regeneration’, a song full of vitality.
A second album 'Feel Free' was released in 1996. 
Mike has played with many bands over the years including 'Coloursound' and 'Dead Men Walking' but he could never find his place. In 2000 he reformed 'The Alarm' with the 'Sisters of Mercy' and 'The Mission's Craig Adams; 'Gene loves Jezebel's James Stevenson and 'The Stiff Little Fingers' Steve Grantley. They have released 2 albums, 'In the Poppyfields' and 'Under Attack'. Unfortunately, in October last year, Mike was re-diagnosed with cancer, but announced in July 2006 the double good news that he is now in complete remission and that he and his wife, Jules, are expecting their second baby due to arrive in January 2007l
