There are three artists under this name:

(1) "In time of art & decadence the freedom of individual thinking will survive. Electronica is part of it. Colours of the colourless will grow, sights of the blinds will die. Magic & white lines are crossing darkness, sex, rapture, pain, sin, love, beauty, death & destruction."

Replicant was formed in 2006. After a long time of making music in different areas of music, Lennox was being ready for something darker & harder. Till then he was just famous for making electro and experimental pop. He made an ambient album called Paranoid Desire, some first demos and promo material, collected and later released on a private pressed sampler called Revolution. Lennox continued with first single releases on the internet. Then the first EP followed. A world full of glam, darkness, shiver, pain, sex, melancholy, disaster, modern life & brittish coolness.

(2) Japanese indie-pop band formed by Sanae Yamasaki (vocals, electronics) and Hideyuki Sasaki (guitar). Replicant have become the successors to Watoo Watoo on the Radio Khartoum label, filling the air with lithe and graceful indiepop, light on its feet and just sweet enough to hide that little something else. A hint of sadness, perhaps? Their debut album, Kuuki No Soko, was co-produced by Masayuki Takahashi from 800 Cherries, and fans of the latter definitely won't be disappointed.
