Mithotyn was a Viking metal band from Mjölby, Sweden.

Formed in 1992 as a blackened death metal act under the name Cerberus by founding members; Christian "Christer" Schütz, Stefan Weinerhall who stayed with the band to the end, and Johan who left shortly afterward. After one year, they renamed themselves to Mithotyn. As Mithotyn, they would not release an album until 1997. Much of the material featured on the three albums of their career were previously composed or featured on one of their previous demos such as the song "The Guardian" from Promo'96. The group released three albums: In the Sign of the Ravens followed by King of the Distant Forest, and finishing with Gathered Around the Oaken Table in 1999. Mithotyn officially dissolved in 1999 while Stefan Weinerhall and Karsten Larsson eventually formed Falconer.

The meaning of Mithotyn is Mythos" meaning story, or legend, and "Tin" being a medieval reference for time. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mithotyn">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
