The Late B.P. Helium is the solo recording project and, at times, stage name of Elephant Six musician Bryan Poole, who also goes by Bryan Helium.

Poole has spent much of his musical career playing bass on and off with Of Montreal and Elf Power. In 2001, he released a few singles and submitted tracks to various compilations before offering his first EP, Kumquat Mae, on his 2002 national tour. It was later re-released on Orange Twin Records in 2003, and allowed him to work on his solo debut album, Amok, which was also released on Orange Twin in 2004.

Poole is now a full-time member of of Montreal. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Late+B.P.+Helium">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
