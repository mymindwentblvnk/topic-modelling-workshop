1. Requiem is a  Swiss Death Metal band.
Swiss Death-Metal band REQUIEM was founded in 1997 by Phil Klauser (Guitars), Ralph Inderbitzin (Guitars) and Roger Kradolfer (Drums). All of them played in several Punk-, Thrash- or Black-Metal bands before.
Beginning of 1998 Michi Kuster (Vocals/Bass) from the swiss Black-Metal Band MOONFOG joined the line-up. Shortly after they recorded a mini-CD called "Prophecies Of A Dark Millenium" at a friends home-studio. This CD has never been released, they've only made some copies for their friends. REQUIEMs first shows started.
In early 1999 during a six month break from playing live, REQUIEM wrote a completely new live set which they presented at the first gig with new drummer Adi Fuhrer (ex-CORRUPTION, ex-MEGORA) at the end of October 1999. Being a part of it, a great Death-Metal era was reborn.
During the year 2000, REQUIEM played a lot of shows in europe and some small tours. Organized and booked by themselves. Thanks a lot to all the people who supported the scene and REQUIEM all the years! Keep the roots of Death-Metal alive!
In the middle of January 2001, REQUIEM recorded their first 5-song mini-CD called "Nameless Grave" at the Dynamo Studio, Zurich, which was released in March 2001 through Fastbeast Entertainment (CH).
After playing a lot of gigs and festivals in Europe and signing a deal with Revenge Productions (GER) in February 2002, REQUIEM decided to record a new full-length CD, called "Formed At Birth". Meanwhile drummer Adi Fuhrer was replaced by Reto Crola from the swiss Death-Metal band PUNISH.
In January 2003, REQUIEM recorded "Formed At Birth" at the Dynamo Studio in Zurich again and released the CD in March 2003 through Revenge Productions (GER). They played a lot of shows and festivals in Europe and were proud to support the legendary MESSIAH reunion show "Reanimation 2003" at Abart Music Club in Zurich. End of 2003, Reto had to take a break due to his job and other projects. As a result of that, former member Adi Fuhrer was back in REQUIEM as a session drummer. Further on, they engaged former MESSIAH bass player Patrick Herrsche. That decision allows Michi Kuster to concentrate only on vocals and to create more various and diverse vocal structures.
The year 2004 started as a great year: REQUIEM played at the Fuck The Commerce Festival (GER), the Obscene Extreme Festival (CZ) and had a great tour with BENEDICTION (UK), MASTER (US/CZ) and DIVINE EMPIRE (US) through Switzerland, Austria and Germany. Due to health problems of bass player Patrick Herrsche, bass player Ralf Winzer (www.ralfwinzer.com) from german Thrash-Metal band UPPERCUT (GER) and ex-CURARE (GER) took over the place in November 2004 for the recording sessions of the new CD and further shows in 2005.
In early 2005, they recorded their new full-length effort "Government Denies Knowledge". This production was mixed and mastered by canadian masterminds Jean-François Dagenais from KATAKLYSM and Bernard Belley. Many record labels showed interest in releasing "Government Denies Knowledge". Finally, they signed a contract with the german label Massacre Records. REQUIEM hit the road in september 2005 as support for US Death-Metal band VITAL REMAINS on their european tour and played in eight different countries.
The new CD "Government Denies Knowledge" was released on January, 27th 2006.
After the release and fantastic reviews in magazines and fanzines all over the world the band went on the road again as support of swedish Death-Metal institution DISMEMBER, playing 14 shows in Italy, Austria, Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands.
During december 2007, REQUIEM produced the new album "Premier Killing League" with producer Andy Classen at Studio Stage One (GER). The release date was March, 23rd 2007 through Massacre Records (GER) again.
