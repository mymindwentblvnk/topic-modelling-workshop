Debodified is a Brutal Death Metal band from North Carolina, USA. The band formed in 2001 as a side project amongst to musical advocates. The project was supposed to first start as a blasting black metal project as the band members had a death metal band already called Lust of Decay. However, both counterparts Jordan V and Chris B knew that death metal was the pulse of what they believed in writing, so the transition was easy. Both members wrote 8 tracks for the “Utopia in the Eyes of a Beast” album put out by Comatose Records which was  blasting slam groove in form with low-pitched growls. The lyrics were based on the current affairs at the time which was the Iraq war.

The band started to recruit some new members but the band disbanded just months after the first release because of difficulties within the band. However, Chris B and Jordan V will be back with new material under different name sometime near the future.
