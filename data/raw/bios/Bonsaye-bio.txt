Bonsaye is an homage to all things good in life and imbued with an uplifting and carefree character there’s just no escaping the intense sense of wellbeing that spreads as you listen. Behind the project is Swedish producer trio Axel Berggren, Hampus Zander and Mattias Westergren. Hailing from the northern parts of Sweden, their hometown Umeå is a far cry from the sun drenched latitudes you associate with Bonsaye. Their mix of soft house and Caribbean influences is as enticing as it is flawlessly executed with infectious rhythms and a steady backbeat that will have even your grandad moving his hips. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bonsaye">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
