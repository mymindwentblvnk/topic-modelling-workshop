The formation of the band began in the beginning of 2009 through the efforts of lead guitarist Ryszard and drummer James, shortly joined by bassist Adam. The aim was to produce a style that preserved the powerful, brutal and potent aspects of death metal and to fuse it with influences from melodic metal and an array of other technical metal genres. The long search for a talented but captivating vocalist that suited the bands’ style was over when Imre joined and writing soon started. As writing progressed, the need for a second guitarist was evident and Steve joined towards the end of 2009 to fill the void. 

With the completed line-up, the band quickly put down new material and began gigging venues in and around London, every time receiving impressive reviews and a rapidly expanding fan base. 

At the turn of 2010 Alareiks sought the aid of producer Misha Nikolic at Monster Trax studios in Chiswick, London in getting their much anticipated first demo ‘Apocalyptic Process’ out. Art work for the demo was provided by world renowned digital artist Gustavo Sazes who has done work for Arch Enemy, Nightrage and God Forbid just to name a few. 

This is set to be an exciting year for the band with many upcoming national gigs, magazine exposures and offers of supporting roles on tour for a number of huge acts.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Alareiks">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
