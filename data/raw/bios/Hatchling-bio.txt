About
Hatchling bridges the aggression and fundamentals of traditional death metal to an evident platform of musicality. Unburying melodic passages from heavy and intense instrumentation, the band explores and incorporates their harmonic findings in elaborate presentations. The band makes use of various harsh vocal stylings, often layered between multiple members, powerful, dizzying riffing and a deep-rooted, solid percussive foundation. These are all key elements to the overall sound; A sound constantly contracting into tight, grinding sections and expanding into wide-open, refreshing and fulfilling musical spaces. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/hatchling">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
