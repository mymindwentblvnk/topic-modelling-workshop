Khepri is a musician, composer and producer. He plays many instruments from electric and acoustic guitars to keyboard to more exotic instruments such as sitar. He's a strong advocate of music theory and history as he discovered it drastically expanded his skill and musical palette.

Khepri's musical style is a fusion of gothic metal and grunge induced rock bathed in a sea of middle eastern and north african influences. Sounding similar to that of oriental metal and rock bands such as Myrath, Al Qaynah, Beyond East, Hazerfan and Saracens. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Khepri">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
