Us3 is a jazz-rap group founded in London in 1991. They use samples of classic songs released by Blue Note Records. Among them is "Cantaloop (Flip Fantasia)", sampling Herbie Hancock's "Cantaloupe Island" on their first album Hand on the Torch. The song received much attention, approaching platinum status in the United States and being adopted as the theme music to the WBUR public radio program The Connection. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Us3">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
