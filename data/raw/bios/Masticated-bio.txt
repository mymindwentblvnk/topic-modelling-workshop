MASTICATED is a technical death metal band from Jersey, Channel Islands. 

Joey Sequeira and Mariusz Sobiech started the band in the beginnings of 2008, composing and experimenting with various technical progressive death metal material. Sam Wilcocks and Ricardo joined the band on Drums and Bass, followed by Elio Santos on guitars. During 2010 Mariousz headed back to Poland to bring up a family leaving the band to operate as a 4 piece. Shortly after this Laszlo Maros joined as a second guitarist. This line up stood until July 2011.  

At this time due to musical differences the band went through some changes, resulting in Ricardo and Lazslo leaving to focus on other projects. To fill these vacancies Ryan Hidrio and Andy Bowman, who were part of the death metal band Trepidation, were asked to join Masticated.

Masticated now consists of: 
Joey Sequeira - vocals
Elio Santos - guitars
Ryan Hidrio - guitars
Andy Bowman - Bass
Sam Wilcocks - Drums

As of February 2012 Masticated are in the process are recording their debut album that should be ready later this year.
