Enterro - "burial" in Portuguese - is a black metal band from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (2006). They started as a side project of guitarists Doneedah and Ozorium (a.k.a. Donida and China, of popular contrycore act Matanza), with bassist Kaffer (guitars on Darkest Hate Warfront), Nihil (V), and Perazzo (D) - both ex-Mortus.

In 2008, they were the support band in Brazil for extreme metal legends such as Mayhem, Vader and Behemoth. Their first full-length album, Nunc Scio Tenebris Lux, featuring 9 tracks, was independently released in the same year.
