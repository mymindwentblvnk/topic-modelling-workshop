Cyprian were a Power Metal band formed in St. John's, NL, Canada. The group released an EP containing four tracks in 2005. They have since disbanded.

Perhaps more famously though (according to number of plays atleast), Cyprian is also a two time trance project by Grant Kearney and Steve Peach that since has been abandoned. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cyprian">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
