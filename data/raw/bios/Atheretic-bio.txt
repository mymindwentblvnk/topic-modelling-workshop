Montreal-based extreme metal band Atheretic was formed in 1999 by 3 graduates from music school. With the release of their first album «Adhesion, Aversion»(Neoblast records) in 2001, the band quickly became one of the main acts in the Montreal scene. They played countless shows throughout the province and gained attention with both fans and media. With a very fast, technical and chaotic approach, Atheretic became one of the most extreme bands around. In 2003, after musical differences, their vocalist left the band for good. With new songs already finished, they started searching for a replacement. In March 2004, a new vocalist joined the band and started writing lyrics for the new material. The chemistry was immediate. The band went out and performed both new and old material on the road, preparing for the studio... The band has just finished recording Apocalyptic Nature Fury. Recorded by Jean-François Dagenais (Kataklysm, Malevolent Creation, Misery Index), the album shows furious intensity, technical dexterity and a chaotic approach. Hungry and more determined than before, Atheretic recently signed with Galy Records to bring their unique form of musical punishment to the masses... Atheretic Witness the apocalypse.
