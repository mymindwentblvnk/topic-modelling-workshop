Blut aus Nord is a black metal band from Mondeville, France. The band started in 1994 as a solo project, with Vindsval playing all instruments under the name Vlad. He released two demos under this title before changing the projects name to Blut Aus Nord before the release of Ultima Thulée in 1995. The next three albums were recorded with the aid of session musicians: It is only recently that the group has had any permanent members apart from Vindsval (who also played in The Eye, Children of Mäani and Yerûšelem).

The project's most critically acclaimed release is The Work Which Transforms God, a concept album which - in spite of being mostly instrumental with none of the lyrics made public - is meant to challenge the listener's prejudices and preconceptions about reality, life and various metaphysical subjects. The Work Which Transforms God has been almost unanimously praised in reviews and was named by Terrorizer Magazine as its number one album of 2003.

Blut aus Nord have dissociated themselves from nationalism, proclaiming a kinship with "environmentalist black metal" bands such as Wolves in the Throne Room.
