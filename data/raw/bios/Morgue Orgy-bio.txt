Forged in 2008, in the molten bowels of the very birthplace of Metal, Birmingham's Morgue Orgy are the UK metal scene's last hope for melodic death metal.

Combining lush diatonic harmony and the thrashy bite of Carcass with the modern sensibilities and razor sharp riffage of The Black Dahlia Murder, and the ability to move from grandiose neoclassical keyboard solos to furious grindesque two minute blasts, Morgue Orgy's formidable live show garnered them a coveted slot at Bloodstock Open Air in 2010, and they've shared the stage with the likes of Anaal Nathrakh, Evile and the Rotted, to name but a few.

Following the release of debut E.P. 'The River & I' and follow up 'Murders Most Foul', (featuring guest vocals Dave Hunt of Anaal Nathrakh), Morgue Orgy are currently promoting their debut full length "The Last Man On Earth", due for release on Christmas Day. With a music video for '4 Days' and a small October tour in England, Morgue Orgy are ready to Rot n Roll!
