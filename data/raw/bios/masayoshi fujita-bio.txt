Masayoshi Fujita is a vibraphonist and composer based in Berlin. Being influenced by 
classic, jazz and many other kinds of music, but not following ordinary vibraphone play style and 
theory of composition, Masayoshi seeks his own sound of vibraphone, and new possibility of it.

He also makes unique and beautiful sounds using bows (for string instruments), 
strings of beads and other objects on his vibraphone.

His first acoustic album "Stories" was released on Flau in 2013. In June 2015 it was announced that he had signed to the Erased Tapes label.
