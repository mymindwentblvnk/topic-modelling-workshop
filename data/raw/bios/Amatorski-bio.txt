Amatorski is a young Belgian band formed in 2008 and based in Ghent, with a melancholic and narrative style, and some reminiscences of Portishead, Sigur RÃ³s, or Radiohead. Though their name means 'amateurs', they reached the finals of the Belgian rock contest Rockrally in 2010. The intimate song Come Home hit #1 in 'De Afrekening', the alternative hit chart on radio station Studio Brussel. In 2010 they released the Same Stars We Shared (Amatorski debut) EP. Their debut longplayer TBC was released in May 2011.

Amatorski is Inne Eysermans (songs, producing, voice, piano, guitar, accordeon), Sebastiaan van den Branden (guitar, programming, voice), Hilke Ros (double bass, synth bass, voice), and Christophe Claeys (drums, vibraphone, trumpet).
