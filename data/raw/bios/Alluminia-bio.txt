Alluminia is the creation of Ruben Monteiro and Iron Fortunato. The band first played in November 2000 and since then has been playing in night clubs and festivals in the Lisbon region. Having started with cover songs, they have now been playing their own original material since 2003. In 2003 they recorded a demo CD with three songs and 2005 saw the first single: Shaky Existence.

2006 brought a deal with a small label from Lisbon, Graphonola Records and until now two works have been made: Dangerous Loudness, a split CD with the band In Pectus, which features three remastered songs from the demo “After Hate” and the single “Shaky Existence” plus a new version of the song “One of a kind”.

In April 2007 the band will release their first commercial title: "Power On Self Test" which as the words indicate is a self test for what they expect to be the start of a long musical journey.
