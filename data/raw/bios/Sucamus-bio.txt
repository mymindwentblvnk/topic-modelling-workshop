A singer, drummer, 2 guitarists and a bass player tried to put their skills in practice, which meant that Sucamus was born. Back in 1998, Sucamus started as any other high-school garage band. A mix of musical preferences was responsible for a surprising death metal sound. In 2000 the demo 'Riotous' was recorded and a couple of hundred copies were sold. The appearance of a saxophone in a couple of songs seemed to be daring.

The next full length album 'Iconoclast' was recorded in 2003 and included female rock oriented vocals; yet another surprising element in Sucamus' metal. Despite many positive reactions, the band split in 2004, due to a confliciting mix of musical preferences...
