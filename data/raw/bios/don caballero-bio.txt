Don Caballero is a critically-acclaimed instrumental rock group from Pittsburgh, USA. They are often categorized as math rock, though the band dislikes this label. The group took their name from the character Guy Caballero, portrayed by Joe Flaherty, on the sketch comedy show Second City Television. In SCTV's parody of the film The Godfather, Guy Caballero is called "Don Caballero."

Don Caballero (affectionately called "Don Cab" or "The Don" by fans) formed in the summer of 1991, released five albums on Touch and Go Records between 1993 and 2000, then disbanded in November 2000. Drummer Damon Che recruited new personnel for a reconstituted Don Caballero in 2003, but this new lineup has been met with mixed reception from fans. They have since signed to Relapse Records and released a new album, titled World Class Listening Problem, on May 16, 2006. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Don+Caballero">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
