Personal life
Helene Fischer was born in the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk, Russia (then the Soviet Union) as the second child to Peter and Maria Fischer. Her father worked as a physical education teacher and her mother as an engineer at a university. Her paternal grandparents were Volga Germans who had been deported to Siberia in 1941 by Joseph Stalin. In 1988, at the age of four, she emigrated with her parents and her six year older sister to Wöllstein, Rhineland-Palatine, West Germany.

After graduating from school, Helene Fischer attended the Frankfurt Stage & Musical School for three years, where she studied singing and acting. During this time, Helene performed on stage at the Staatstheater Darmstadt, as well as on the stage of the Volkstheater Frankfurt. Since May 2008 she has been dating Florian Silbereisen. In October 2011 Fischer was presented with her own wax figure in the Berlin Madame Tussauds museum.

Career
During her time at the Stage & Musical School, her mother secretly copied a demo CD with six of Fischer's songs and sent it to different recording studios to gauge the reaction of professionals.

Fischer's debut on stage took place on 14 May 2005, in a program of the TV channel ARD. It was a duet with the singer Florian Silbereisen. The two later became a couple.

She has won 17 "Echo" awards, the "Goldene Henne" award 7 times, 3 Bambi Awards, and the "Krone der Volksmusik" prize four times. All her albums and DVDs have achieved multiple gold and double platinum status. Her songs, with their stories of the everyday worries and woes of home-loving folks, are lyrically close to what could be called "country music" although musically quite different.

Her circle of fans extends beyond Germany into large part to Austria, Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, England, and Finland.

She released her first English album, "The English Ones", on 7 June 2010. The album was produced by Jean Frankfurter, a German producer, composer and arranger for 40 years. On singing in English, Fischer commented: "I have always dreamed of singing my songs in another language. English is the language of Country, the music that we call ’Schlager’. Language is a tool, but it is important that what you sing comes from the heart – and that is what this album is about."

In January 2013 she made her acting debut in an episode of the German TV series "Das Traumschiff".

On 4 October 2013 she released her album "Farbenspiel" in Germany, and confirmed a Tour in the year 2014. The album received platinum after 5 days in Germany, Denmark and Austria.

On 12 May 2017, she released her latest album Helene Fischer (2017). It sold over 300,000 copies in Germany in its first week of release, the biggest debut for a female in German history and the 2nd biggest overall. It is certified 5x Platinum in Germany.
