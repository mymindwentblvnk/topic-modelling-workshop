Witch’s Mark came together in early 2006. Witch’s Mark which originally started out as an acoustical band, but slowly molded into a Pagan Rock scenario. The idea was for a Pagan religious Rock band to create and perform music for the local Pagan community. We perform original music, some cover songs and parodies of popular songs converted to a Pagan theme. Most of the songs we perform are of Pagan subject matter. All of the band members are active Pagans and we are very dedicated to our beliefs & music, so we figured it would be great to combine the 2 greatest loves in our lives and voila Witch’s Mark is the offspring.

The lineup consists of Rowan, Mannun, Thelema, Monad and Axiom.
