Chicago underground hip-hop artist Ramaj Eroc has always explored through a variety of topics & sounds with his music since he started writing at the age of 11. Born Jamar Core in Chicago's Roseland neighborhood, Ramaj's frequent moves from the city to the suburbs inspired all of his experiences. Influenced by the likes of Diddy, Kanye West, Ludacris, J. Cole, as well as known Rock band Linkin Park & battle MC Reed Dollaz, his 2011 relocation to Los Angeles changed everything.
