Pretty & Nice are a Boston quartet bent on creating joyous feelings.  Songs are born on sunny porches, zapped with electricity, arranged around dancing morpho-rhythms, and slingshot skyward. It’s an advanced pop crash course, and your brain may have trouble keeping up with your feet.

Having shared tours and stages with bands like Built to Spill, The Get Up Kids, Miniature Tigers, The Thermals and Jukebox the Ghost, one can imagine the impact Pretty & Nice delivers up close and personal.  Live, the arrangements explode into an array of shifting shapes and colors, pitting Costello against Cocteau in an epic bounce-house duel ending in broken strings and hugs all around.  

From their debut, Pink & Blue, to the Hardly Art-released Get Young, and throughout their new EP, US YOU ALL WE, the music of Pretty & Nice is engineered for repeat listens. Songs blossom multiple times, tightrope walking between complexity and accessibility with tremendous balance. The Onion’s AV Club says it well: “The band buries post-punk hooks under feverish ranting and the trash-can clang of robotic electro... Riffs are spot-welded to jerky beats, and the whole sound hinges on a gleeful self-deconstruction.” <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pretty+&+Nice">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
