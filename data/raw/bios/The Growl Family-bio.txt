Under the unknown (in those days) Growl name, this group published end of 2007 the album "Rotten Womb" which would later be nominated for the 2008 Graffiti Awards in the category Best Album of Heavy Metal, and would enable them to be part the Central Metal Fest and be opened for the Brazilians Krisiun show in Uruguay.

Later the band changed its name to The Growl Family (check interview in this issue), and edited "Putrifixion" (2009) through the Uruguayan Extreme Zone Records label.

Most of the artwork that involves a CD was done by TGF production (shared with Carlos and Mario Fonsalia Productions MC) and to the book and cover design by Monster Design I was supervised by Rodrigo Alfonso, I did not like design at all.
