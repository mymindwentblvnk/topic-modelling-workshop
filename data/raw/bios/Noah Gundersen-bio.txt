Noah Gundersen, lead singer of the The Courage (also known as Noah Gundersen And The Courage), hails from Centralia, Washington - a small town 85 miles south of Seattle on the I-5 corridor. Gundersen has been making music since childhood, learning piano at a young age and later teaching himself guitar. He often played in cafés as a teen, occasionally with his younger sister, Abby Gundersen, the two have been formally producing music since 2005. 

Gundersen's music banks on strong lead vocals, boasting a poetic and lyrical charm, backed by ambient backgrounds of strings and percussion. Gundersen's music has been called a blend of melancholy folk and electric euphoria, occasionally drawing comparisons to the likes of Elijah Wyman, David Wilcox, and Damien Rice. Drawing the attention of crowds across the South Puget Sound region, Noah Gundersen regularly performs in a variety of settings, ranging from small college basements to more prestigious venues such as the Triple Door, the Crocodile Cafe, and the Columbia City Theater. 

Gundersen and his younger sister usually create studio work on their own - together they have produced two EPs, a live album, and most recently two full length albums:

• Brand New World EP (Noah Gundersen) - 2008
• Live at The Triple Door (Noah Gundersen & The Courage) - 2008
