Lighting up stages and penning heartfelt lyrics since 2015, The Season is a Christian alternative rock band from Rochester, NY. Whether through heavy rock songs or more chill piano ballads, The Season aims to spread a message of hope... the kind they believe can only be found in Jesus Christ. The group quickly gained a presence in the local music scene during their first three years, releasing 2 records (including EP’s “Through the Dark” & “Portraits of a Beating Heart”) as well as sharing the stage with big-name headliners like Red Jumpsuit Apparatus and Hawthorne Heights. The band was recently excited to announce a new record is also currently in the making. Ever since members Andrew Bonistall, Anthony Riehl, and identical twin brothers Gabriel & Elijah Switzer bonded over their brother-like friendship & passion for music, opportunities to take the stage have snowballed. And while the band’s genre headlines as alternative rock, you’ll also hear notes of pop-punk with subtle hardcore influences in their fist-pumping but relatable music. Be sure to give The Season a follow on social media for news, updates, new releases, and a frequent peek into any of the super fun shenanigans they may be up to!
