Desert near the end always thought of themselves as a missing link! Taking their first musical steps in the Greek metal scene of the 90’s they grew up with the great Power/Thrash bands of that era. But as the years passed they had the feeling that this sound has somehow lost its edge and so they made their mission to connect that sound with the front line of today’s metal.
The band started in 2009 when bassist/songwriter Akis Prasinikas and vocalist Alexandros Papandreou, who were playing together since their school days, decided to put aside all other projects and form something that combines their mutual routes with all the influences they gathered over the years as metal fans. Since then, they have released two albums: “A Crimson Dawn” in 2011 (self-financed) and “Hunt for the Sun” in 2014 (Total Metal Records). The mastering in “Hunt for the sun” was done by John K. (Biomechanical) and received very positive reviews from Greek and international media. It scored 7/10 in Metal Hammer (GR) and 7.5/10 in Rock Hard (GER). They describe their sound as story driven Power/Thrash Metal since all their work is based on the same concept story about a man’s search for “his” real sun whose light guides and not only blinds and how this search becomes inspiration for all humanity. At the moment they have finished the production of their third album named “Theater of War” which was mixed and mastered by Tue Madsen (the Haunted, Heaven Shall Burn, Kataklysm, etc) at Ant Farm studio. The album features their most extreme approach musically and lyrically brings the story to its conclusion.
