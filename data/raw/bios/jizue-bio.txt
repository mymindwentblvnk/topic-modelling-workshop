Jizue (ジズー), stylized as jizue and pronounced "Jizu", is a instrumental piano driven post-rock/nu-jazz band from Kyoto, Japan. Formed in 2006 by guitarist Norimasa Inoue, bassist Tsuyoshi "Gou" Yamada, and drummer Shin Kogawa. Piano player Kataki "Kie" Nozomiyo joined the following year. Their music was influenced by post-rock, together with jazz, which led to their present fusion sound. 

They have performed at large music festivals such as Fuji Rock. In 2017, they were signed to Victor Entertainment. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/jizue">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
