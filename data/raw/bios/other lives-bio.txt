Other Lives is an American indie rock band from Stillwater, Oklahoma, United States. The band originally formed in 2004 as Kunek and released one album in 2006 under that name. 

Kunek was a genre smoothie. Toss some indie, folk, post-rock, and ambient in a blender and set to awesome. In August 2008, Kunek announced via their Myspace that Kunek will live on only through their fantastic but lone album, Flight of the Flynns. Five members of Kunek have transferred to a new band under the Other Lives moniker. The debut album from the Stillwater, Oklahoma band is finished as of August 2008, produced by Joey Waronker (Beck, REM) and will be released via TBD records (Radiohead, Underworld).  Their sophomore album, Tamer Animals, was released in May 2011 on TBD records.

The 5 members of Other Lives/Kunek are as follows:
Colby Owens Drums
Josh Onstott: Bass, Organ
Jonathan Mooney: Keyboards (Acoustic Guitar),
Jenny Hsu: Cello,
Jesse Tabish: Lead Vocals (Piano, Guitar)  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Other+Lives">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
