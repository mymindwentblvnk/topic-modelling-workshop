Joachim Deutschland (* 31. Juli 1980 in Stuttgart; born Christof Johannes Joachim Faber) is a German Rock singer
who has both German and US-American citizenship. His father is from Hamburg, Germany and his mother from Denver, USA.

Joachim was born into a musical family. His grandfather was a composer and both of his parents are Jazz-musicians. 

He lived in Hamburg until he was 16 and then moved to California to start a basketball career. Since this career didn't turn out as he had planned he joined the US-Army where he was supposed to be for 4 years but dropped out illegally after one year and left the US. Therefore he was arrested when he travelled back to the States in February 2004.

Ever since leaving the Army he dedicated his life to music and has released two albums so far.

His band consists of himself (Guitar, vocals), Sascha Laumann (Bass) und Dominik Scholz (drums). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Joachim+Deutschland">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
