Tyler was first a member of Lambchop and Silver Jews, which started in 1998, and this was before he became a solo artist. Tyler first joined Lambchop in 1998 at the age of 19 because Kurt Wagner approached him about playing the organ in the band. However, it turned out that he got to play guitar because he admittedly said "I couldn't really play" the organ. In 2010, Tyler released a universally acclaimed album entitled Behold the Spirit, and in 2013 released another critically acclaimed album entitled Impossible Truth.

His debut studio album Behold the Spirit was released on November 22, 2010. Adam Bednarik produced the album along with Tyler on Tompkins Square Records, and the release became universally acclaimed. Tyler's second studio album, Impossible Truth, was released on March 19, 2013 by Merge Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/William+Tyler">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
