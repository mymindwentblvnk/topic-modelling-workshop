A Deeper Dreed, the melodic metal band from Suffolk (England), have completed their debut EP 'Masquerade' with producer Mark Mynett (ex. Kill II This, City of God) in late 2010.

With a reputation for exceptional live performances bearing heavy, infectious, all-out riffing, ‘A Deeper Dreed’ bring a refreshing blend of heavy metal packed with gracious harmonies and inescapable hooks to the workbench with reviewers picking up on many influences from the roots of early heavy metal.

Early in their career the band have been privileged to perform with many industry names such as Alan Davey's (ex. Hawkwind) band 'Gunslinger', London's own, 'Die-So-Fluid', the british festival regulars 'Voodoo-Six' and also Sweeden's own chart-topping 'Dead by April' for a rare UK headline show. Add to this their collaboration with producer Mark Mynett who has just completed work with the up-and-coming 'Godsized', the band are aiming to continue to spread the word of ‘A Deeper Dreed’.

Formed in the early months of 2010, the band have focused their collective eye on writing music to connect with those who listen to it at their live shows. The band work hard on trying to involve everyone in the music, making the audience part of the performance itself. Maybe it’s for this reason that some promoters have dubbed them 'The New Iron Maiden'. 

Drawing on many influences, the band deliver rock-solid riffing to light-fingered soloing, exuberant sing-along chorus' to all-out sweaty moshing. The band aims to deliver the right ingredients to any metal fan who likes to bang their head and moan about a sore neck for the next day.

Their EP, ‘Masquerade’ is now available to buy or download online featuring over 28 minutes of original tracks recorded in July of 2010. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/A+Deeper+Dreed">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
