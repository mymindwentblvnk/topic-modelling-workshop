Rhys Chatham (b. September 19, 1952, New York City) is an American avant-garde composer, guitarist, and trumpet player. He currently lives in France.

In the early 1970s Chatham was the first music director of The Kitchen in New York. His early compositions owed a significant debt to La Monte Young and other minimalists.

After viewing Punk bands playing in CGCB in new york, he composed “Guitar Trio,” a seven-plus minute exploration of punk fury fused with minimal composition that could not be more relevant 30 years later.

In celebration of the song’s anniversary, a silver-haired, axe-wielding Chatham took to the road last year, assembling a new band of Guitar Trio all-stars at just about every stop, and repeatedly playing the hell out of a lengthier “Guitar Trio” manifestation. This release captures 10 live performances from that tour, with a number of guest guitarists, including Chatham contemporaries Alan Licht and Tony Conrad, both members of the Canadian Silver Mt. Zion collective, as well as Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore and Lee Ranaldo. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rhys+Chatham+&+His+Guitar+Trio+All-Stars">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
