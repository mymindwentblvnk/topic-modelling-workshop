Hailing originally from Chester and Darlington, Agent of the Morai formed in early 2005 in the cold, black heart of Leeds 666. They play harsh, down-tuned stoner doom and (unusually for the genre) they consist simply of: guitar (Chris Fielding); vocals (Chris Hardy) and drums (Andrew Swift).
Since their first show in June 2005 they've been likened to eyehategod, Iron Monkey and Electric Wizard and have subsequently played with such luminaries as Capricorns, Baroness, Taint, Ramesses, Debris Inc., Lazarus Blackstar, Buried Inside, Humanfly, Red Stars Parade and Red Right Hand.
Earlier this year they were nominated for the "prestigious" Leeds Independent Music Awards, alongside Send More Paramedics, Red Stars Parade and Executive Distraction Tasks.
The 12" is their first release and was recorded by Chris Fielding at Whitby Studios. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Agent+of+the+Morai">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
