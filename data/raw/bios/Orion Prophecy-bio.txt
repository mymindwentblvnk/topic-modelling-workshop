The band has been created in 2006 in little town called Knurów, in southern Poland. The core of the group consists of two Lyzniak brothers - Danio and Stanley. They are responsible for the first riffs and first arrangements. Soon joined by Marek Zając, the band slowly shaped to be what it is now - after numerous lineup changes it seems like stability is at hand with Rafał "Zwierzak" Habrajski behind the drumkit, and "Robbie" Zembrzycki performing the guitar duties. The band has already recorded one full length album and is now working on another release, while playing major gigs around Poland.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Orion+Prophecy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
