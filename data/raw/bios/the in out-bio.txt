The In Out draws from an amalgam of styles reflecting the musical fantasies of a peculiar gathering of 3 North American men. Rockabilly, Prog, white R&B, so-called Post/Punk, Glam and Metal are all in the mix, and the singing upholds the tradition of snide non-vocalists such as Sky Saxon and Mark E. Smith.

"Underrated" is a favorite adjective lobbed at the band and "Sounds like The Fall" was recently upgraded to "Sounds like The Cramps meets The Fugs.” 

As one musician friend states (correctly): "The In Out are one of the few bands out of Boston that transcends local band status." It's proven to be very danceable and yes, they are quite popular with the ladies.

Think: How can you go wrong with songs about Line Cooks and non-hygienic handshakes, and a hard rock anthem for the terminally ill? The only thing missing is a tribute to the Gay Triple A – and that may be coming. Stay Tuned.
