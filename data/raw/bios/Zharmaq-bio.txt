Zharmaq started in September 2002 by three friends in Salg칩tarj치n, Hungary. Their plan was to play something like melodic death metal but they wanted to find their own voice and operate with hungarian lyrics. It was hard to find the missing band members, they had their first 5 person rehearsal in the beginning of 2005. After this they had some concerts, they recorded Hum치nkapt치r EP (Human Hive). They wanted to step forward and they changed their name to Corrodal in the beginning of 2008. Corrodal plays more melodic and unique music than Zharmaq. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Zharmaq">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
