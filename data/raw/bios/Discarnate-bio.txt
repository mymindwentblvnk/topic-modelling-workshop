Discarnate was an old school swedish death metal band formed by Mikael Jonsson, Martin Sjögren and Putte Andersson in Östersund, Sweden in 2011.  At first as The False Divine but later changed their name after Putte left the band and a change in musical direction. Johan Karlsson joined as vocalist right before recording their first and only EP "Embraced By Death", which was released in 2013. The group disbanded shortly after due to the members no longer living in the same area.
