Cybernetic Witch Cult are a groovaceous metal band who take their influences from Doom metal, 70s rock, stoner rock, space rock and science fiction B movies. A serious band with a fun outlook on music, the lyrics tell stories of invasions, time travel, space and cult horror.

Cybernetic Witch Cult were formed in the winter of 2013 in Cornwall, after an early lineup change, Alex Wyld, Kale Deane and Liam Stocks became the driving force behind the band. 2015 involved 19 gigs, the recording and release of album "Morlock Rock", opening for Diesel King, Wight, Tribulation, Skraeckoedlan, radio play, features in Terrorizer and Classic Rock magazines and a massive growth in fans. The band replaced drummer Liam Stocks in late 2015 due to personal issues, and Rogan Collins took his place.

Early 2016 saw the writing and recording of the second album 'Spaceous Cretaceous' which was released on the 28th May, recieved excellent reviews from critics and fans and has already sold out of the first edition of pressings! The band supported Skraeckoedlan on the southwest dates of their UK tour and had the honour of supporting Purson on the Plymouth date of their tour. The band have several festival appearances this summer and are looking towards the future with multiple tours on the horizon and a venture into mainland Europe being planned for Spring 2017.
