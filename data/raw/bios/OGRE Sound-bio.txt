Robin Ogden (OGRE / OGRE Sound) is a composer for games and visual media, self confessed tape loop splicer, spring reverb tickler, and harbinger of imagined soundtracks for films that don't exist.

His work is grounded in a lifelong love affair with sound, whether produced from wonky analog synthesizers of yester-decades, contact microphones or strange and wonderful handmade instruments.

His music can be found in the award winning indie games Actual Sunlight, This Is The Police I & II, and Hacknet: Labyrinths, HBO's Vice Principals, Fangoria’s Hollydoom, Josan Gonzalez’ The Future Is Now series, and he was an audio consultant for the BBC’s first VR experience, Easter Rising: Voice Of A Rebel.

Robin was named Electronic Sound Magazine’s One To Watch 2019 for his work with Dallas Campbell on their conceptual narrative album All Hallows’ II.

Robin is featured in, and scored, the forthcoming documentary The Rise Of The Synths, and is currently releasing music with Grammy winning soundtrack label Lakeshore Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/OGRE+Sound">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
