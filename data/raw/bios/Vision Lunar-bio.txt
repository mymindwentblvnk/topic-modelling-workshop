Vision Lunar is a Canadian space black metal band founded on October 6, 2006, the night of a full moon, by Alexandre Julien. The band was originally started as a side project to Julien's black metal band, Throne Of Mortality. Vision Lunar was part of the Triskalyon circle, and released a demo on every night of a full moon for a six month span through Mortification Records. After the fall of Triskalyon, Vision Lunar went on hiatus, until its recovery in late 2007 when a new demo was released. The plan after the hiatus was to recruit other band members to extend it into full band and play shows, however a stable membership was never found. By early 2009, Julien had abandoned Vision Lunar.

In October of 2010, Mortification Records released a complete discography of the band entitled "Phase One (2006-2009)". It features every song recorded by the band. In 2015, Julien reformed Vision Lunar to release the EP Luna Subortus. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vision+Lunar">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
