Either playing solo or with a mutable group of collaborators, Ben Vida spent 2005 establishing Bird Show as a standalone, ongoing musical entity. Vida devoted a good part of 2005 to live performance: touring Italy and going coast to coast in N. America alongside Greg Davis and Keith Fullerton Whitman. Live, Bird Show becomes a group ceremony, Ben at the center surrounded by percussionists with songs morphing and looping, stretching out and becoming charged rhythmic meditation. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bird+Show">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
