P.U.S. was a brazilian Death Metal band, acquiring quite a cult status among the death metal scene for that time. Their sound was old-school death metal with some thrashy influences. Like other brazilian bands of that time, as Sarcofágo and Sepultura

The name P.U.S. stood for "Porrada Ultra Suicida", and later for "Potência Ultra Sônica"

Their last album, "Presets", is a mix of industrial and hip hop.

Syang is now a Brazilian "fifteen-minutres celebrity", after "starring" in a Big-brother-like TV Show called "Casa dos Artistas". She entered the house completely unknown but managed to change this by having an affair, pissing off her husband and arguing with another woman. She's been writing soft, poppy stuff now.

The name "Syang" drifts of a fusion of her name (Simone) with the last name of the AC/DC's guitar man Angus Young.
