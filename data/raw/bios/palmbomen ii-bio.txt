The Netherlands (2009 – present)

Palmbomen is the moniker for Kai Hugo an Electro artist from The Netherlands who also works as a DJ, doing his thing from 2009 onward.

Palmbomen (Dutch for “palm trees”), appropriately delivers a tropical escape from the mundane. Kai Hugo’s music is as experimental as it is contagiously poppy. Haunting vocals and hypnotic synth lines produced by desolated studio equipment create an atmospheric sound that, according to somewhere between 80s Italo and 60s psychedelia. A custom built quasi epileptic light show completes the sensation of being lost in a neon Amazon forest. Kai’s debut ‘Moon Children EP’ is out on NON Records and showcases the uniquely eery sound of Palmbomem. VICE MAGAZINE had this to say about one track in particular off of the release: “He made a song called ‘Myself’ that iTunes says we have already listened to 46 times” <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Palmbomen+II">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
