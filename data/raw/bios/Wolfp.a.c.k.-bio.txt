It grabs you by the throat and never lets go...

In 2007, 4 musicians from the Southernmost part of the Netherlands joined forces, with only one mission: to produce a deafening "straight-in-your-face Death Metal". No thrills, just thumping Metal delivered with deadly precision. Made by fans, for the fans.

The name of that tank rolling on a pile of corpses is Wolfp.a.c.k.,
remember that name!

Wolfp.a.c.k.'s band members are all experienced veterans, who've left their mark on the local music scene, bringing their musical fury on many stages. From their different backgrounds, they each brought their influences like Industrial, Punk and Crossover but they share one passionâ€¦ "Crushing Death Metal".

Wolfp.a.c.k. is:
Arjen Buis : Drums
Ronald Donkervoort : Bass guitar
Kamiel Meijers : Guitar
Clint Tillemans : Vocals

In 2011, Wolfp.a.c.k.'s first CD (going by the name of "I") is finally ready to be proudly presented to the metal world. The first reactions are good and positive feedbacks keep flowing in, from Canada to Turkey, from Denmark to Slovenia, and many other places.

Here's your chance to listen to it and decide for yourself!
