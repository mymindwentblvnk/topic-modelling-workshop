Northern Ontario Black Metal.  Not just another "October-November" band.

The Northern Ontario Black Metal Preservation Society, NOBMPS for short, consisted of members Veillko and Platinus. Due to the tragic  passing of Veillko (David Gold, of Woods of Ypres) in 2011 the band ceased to exist.

Their only EP Future Northern Prosperity can be bought at iTunes. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Northern+Ontario+Black+Metal+Preservation+Society">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
