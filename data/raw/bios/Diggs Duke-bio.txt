Multi-instrumentalist, singer, and songwriter Diggs Duke is from Gary, Indiana. Prior to settling in Washington, D.C., he attended Boston's Northeastern University and took courses at the nearby Berklee College of Music and the New England Conservatory. His first short-form releases of creatively off-center jazz and R&B -- including Gravity, Black Gold, Mass Exodus and Mass Exodus, Vol. 2 -- were issued through his Bandcamp page. In late 2012, "Nine Winning Wives" appeared on Brownswood Bubblers Nine, a compilation from BBC DJ Gilles Peterson's Brownswood label. He closed out 2013 with the release of his first proper album, Offering for Anxious, on Brownswood.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Diggs+Duke">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
