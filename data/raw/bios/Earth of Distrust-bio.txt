The band was formed in 2004 in Athens,Greece.

They started as a hardcore band with crossover in stoner and metal..Each member has different influences, from Jazz to extreme metal, that's why their music is a mix of sounds..In May,2007 band entered Unreal Studios to record its first demo, "I am sin" which got some great reviews from magazines,zines and web zines.After some live gigs and songwriting they entered the studio again and began recording their first full length album.Now the album is ready and it is entitled "Proselytize".It starts right where the demo ends:Metal and Hardcore mixed with punk n roll touches, in the vein of Isis,Kylesa,Integrity and sludge/swampy riffs.The album was mastered by Scott Hull(Agoraphobic Nosebleed,Pig Destroyer) and they put it out on their own.Currently,they are looking for a cool label to distribute it. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Earth+of+Distrust">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
