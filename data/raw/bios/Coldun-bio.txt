Coldun began in the summer of 2006 in Chemnitz, Saxony, when Andras frontman Steffen Thümmel decided to explore other musical ideas. In addition to the bands Andras and Persecution, Coldun is somehow Steffen's most personal and intimate musical expression. To bring the musical vision of "Necessariis? Dubiis? Caritas?" to life he found excellent musicians and friends to work with and the ideas they all had transposed into one of the best Epic Doom Metal albums of 2007.
