PHAZM was born in the fall of 2003.The two chord-whippers, Pierhryck (aka Pierrick Valence, singer on Scarve's third and fourth albums) and Pathryck (aka Patrick Martin from Scarve), found a common passion in creating dark, mud-soaked riffs, as well as in inhaling obscure forest substances. Skin-torturer Dyrhk (aka Dirk Verbeuren from Scarve, Soilwork, Aborted, Artsonic, Lyzanxia) was immediately seduced by this realm of aggressive black metal sounds coated with rock n roll influences, and during the Fall of 2003, Phazm spawned its first aural insanities. Mahx (bazz) left his little stinky hole shortly before the recording of a three tracks demo. The four-piece didnt even take the time to give this demo its originally intended release. Instead, they decided to migrate towards the Danish plains in order to record their first full-length offering with producer Jacob Hansen (ILLDISPOSED, INVOCATOR, ABORTED). During the cold and dark month of December 2003, ten songs were carved onto tape in a very raw and straightforward manner. 

In March 2009, Pierrick announced that Phazm disbanded.
In July 2012 the band announced that they're back.

They have released three albums : 
- Hate At First Seed (2004)
- Antebellum Death'n'Roll (2006)
- Cornerstone Of The Macabre (2008). 

Pierrick joined Agressor on guitars and left Scarve in 2007 to fully concentrate on Phazm. Pierrick also joined the southern-metal band Addicted. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Phazm">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
