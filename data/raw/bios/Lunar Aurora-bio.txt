In December 1994 in Rosenheim, Germany, Lunar Aurora was formed by Aran and Whyrhd. In 1995 they recorded the first Demo: "A Wandering Winterdream Beneath the Cold Moon". 

Only one year later "Auf dunklen Schwingen" was released, another Demo. After that Voices Productions signed the band and in 1996 Lunar Aurora recorded their first official album, which was called "Weltengänger". With the albums "Ars Moriendi", "Elixir of Sorrow", "Zyklus" and "Mond", this band from Rosenheim established their status as one of the most visionary, unique and important projects in the German metal-scene. 

The sound of every release can be considered as slightly different as the sound on the previous one. Generally Lunar Aurora's creations have a dark, cold and spiritual feeling. Using the Keyboard in a intelligent and never exaggerated way they are able to conjure a deep atmosphere.   

In 2007, the band released its 8th studio album, "Andacht", after which Lunar Aurora split.

In 2011 Lunar Aurora's label (http://www.cold-dimensions.de) announced that they were back and working on a new album. On March the 2nd, through Cold Dimensions, "Hoagascht" was released. The album only features lyrics sung in the Upper Bavarian dialect, rather than standard German.

In the autumn of 2012, Lunar Aurora split up again.
