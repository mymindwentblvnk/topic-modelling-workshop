Swedish metal outfit Aktaion formed as a project by Francis Larsson in 2010, initially as a studio-based outlet. With the band's current lineup already performing and recording together in different groups, Jonas Snäckmark (Vocals), Jonatan Ney (Guitar/Keys) and Axel Croné (Bass) organically became involved in the recording process at an early stage. Three long years later, their first full-length Throne has now been released to the public.

Throne features the intense and distinctive compositions outlined by Larsson, with additional work done in collaboration with the members of the band. With Snäckmark Aktaion found the most aggressive vocals Sweden could offer, and together with their combined experience from different musical genres, Croné and Ney helped influence the sound and atmosphere you hear on Throne today.

The album is a product of all the members of Aktaion, and was produced, mixed and mastered by Francis Larsson. Recording took place in the different homes of Larsson during the extended recording process. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Aktaion">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
