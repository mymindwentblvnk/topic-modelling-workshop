Ablaze My Sorrow was founded in the early nineties, and after the requisite demo or two, they recorded two albums in the late nineties, before internal problems threatened to split up the band altogether. They finally rebounded, and released Anger, Hate And Fury in 2002. Now three albums into their career, they are still locked into the prime Swedish melodic death metal style (a la early In Flames or Dark Tranquillity) that they started their career with in the mid-nineties.  Ablaze My Sorrow officially broke up on the 16th of August, 2006, but the band announced their reformation on their Myspace page on January 31st, 2013. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ablaze+My+Sorrow">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
