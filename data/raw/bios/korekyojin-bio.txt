Korekyojin (是巨人; Korekyojinn) is a japanese progressive Rock trio formed by drummer Yoshida Tatsuya (吉田達也) of Ruins, guitarist Kido Natsuki of Bondage Fruit and bassist Nasuno Mitsuru of Ground Zero. The band is one of Tatsuya's many collaborations (Koenjihyakkei, Musica Transonic, Akaten, etc). Korekyojin has released five recordings to date, two of which on John Zorn's label Tzadik, the other three on Yoshida Tatsuya's own Magaibutsu Limited.

Korekyojin was formed in 1999 and recorded in a single day their well received debut album, Korekyojin, which was released that year. The band then went on a 5 year hiatus until 2004 when they reconvened and recorded Arabesque, which was subsequently withdrawn and reissued with extra live tracks. Following in 2005, Isotope, their first live album was released and a third studio album, Jackson, was released the next year in 2006. Their second live album, Swan Dive was released in 2009.

While the style will be recognizable to fans of Koenjihyakkei and Ruins, Korekyojin has its own sound and musical agenda. Almost everything is composed by Yoshida, barring some brief group improvisations, and no vocals. The music is purely instrumental. Every instrument is given an equal role with no musician dubbed the "leader". Their creativity for themes used in their songs makes each piece of work unique. However a few songs do not fit with the rest, and contribute to their experimental side, such as the song "Hash" off their Isotope album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Korekyojin">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
