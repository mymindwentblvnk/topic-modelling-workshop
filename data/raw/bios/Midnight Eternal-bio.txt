Midnight Eternal is a symphonic metal band based out of New York City. It was formed in March of 2014 when two members of Operatika (Richard Fischer and Boris Zaks) invited Daniel Prestup (Rivera Bomma, Spider Rockets) and Mike LePond (Symphony X) to join them in recording a two-song demo. During the recording, the band acquired the talents of vocalist Raine Hilai based on her previous work in theater and her solo endeavor. The planned demo quickly evolved into the formation of a full-time band when it became apparent the group had something special on their hands. Shortly thereafter, Greg Manning (of Spider Rockets, Zamora) joined the band as permanent member taking over bass duties.      

Shortly after releasing their demo, which featured the songs "When Love and Faith Collide" and "Masquerade of Lies", the band began to receive numerous offers and booked a number of high caliber shows. In the years 2014 and 2015, Midnight Eternal shared the stage with Kamelot, Dragonforce, Sonata Arctica, Delain, Xandria, Doro, The Agonist and Quiet Riot, among others. Late 2015, the band hit the studio to record their debut album.

The line-up of Midnight Eternal consists of Raine Hilai (Lead Vocals) Richard Fischer (Guitars) Greg Manning (Bass) Boris Zaks (Keyboards) and Daniel Prestup (Drums). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Midnight+Eternal">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
