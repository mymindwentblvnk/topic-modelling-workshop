Ex-Sydneysider Kat Frankie, now based in Berlin, is a singer-songwriter who performs regularly around Germany. Moving there in 2005, Frankie set about forming a band to flesh out her folk-styled confessionals. Integrity is a byword with Frankie, and debut single The Tops continued a string of self-funded releases, this one released to coincide with an early-2007 Australian tour. 

Prior to The Tops Frankie released an EP “outside.now.” and appeared on several independent compilations from Australia and Germany. “Pocketknife”, her debut album was released in Europe and Australia in mid 2007. Second single "Serves You Right For Using Violence" repeated the national radio play of The Tops.

Frankie also features in BerlinSong, a music documentary made by Uli Schueppel about songwriters in Berlin. The film premiered at the 2007 Berlinale Film Festival.

She consistently tours Europe and makes frequent visits back to Australia to tour and is playing the 2008/09 Falls Festival.

Her new album, "The Dance of a Stranger Heart" will be released in Germany, Switzerland and Austria on 3rd September 2010. An Australian release and tour is in planning for early 2011. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kat+Frankie">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
