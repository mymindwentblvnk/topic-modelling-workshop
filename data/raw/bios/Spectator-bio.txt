1) Saint Louis, Missouri-based dream pop band with releases titled In the Brick (2012) and The Last Exchange (2015).

Combining flute‐like keyboards, guitar and even electronic autoharp, the band has developed a sound that's both lonesome and comforting, and should appeal to fans of the eerie jazzy style of Mazzy Star and Cotton Jones.

Dreampop bands rarely get both sides of the hyphen right… it's a comfort that Spectator makes its recording debut with such a rich, elegantly produced piece of mood music. The songs…reverberate with the plucks of hollowbody guitars and the gentle pulse of warm keyboard tones. 
-Christian Schaeffer, Riverfront Times

Comfortable darkness is a worthy backdrop for Spectator… St.Louis’s dream-pop act is a midnight kiss on record, and anointed with a country balm live. The harmonies…coaxed the room with sultry pillow talk. When Rooney bid the audience farewell with a sweet “We’ll see you later,” it was impossible not to think “hope so.”
