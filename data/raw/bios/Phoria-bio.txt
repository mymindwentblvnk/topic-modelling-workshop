Phoria is a five-piece band from Brighton, England. The band consist of Trewin Howard (vocals), Jeb Hardwick (guitar, visuals), Ed Sanderson (keyboard, vocals), Tim Douglas (bass, synth), and Seryn Burden (Drums).

Phoria released their debut EP Yourself Still in August 2010 as a pay-what-you-want download.

In 2013 the EP Bloodworks was released physically and via iTunes. The hit single 'Red' and accompanying video earned over 100,000 plays on the band's Soundcloud account in only a few days, introducing the band to an international fan community. The EP showed a clear evolution from Yourself Still, introducing elements of electronica and modern pop. Bloodworks was released through London tastemaker label Akira records.

With the attention garnered through the release of Bloodworks and 'Red', Phoria have recently been listed among a number of upcoming acts on several websites' 'Sound of 2014' lists, including respected online magazine Gigwise.

A new EP, titled Display is due for release on 16 June 2014. The lead single 'Emanate' received 250,000 plays across YouTube and Soundcloud in the first two weeks.
