Robin Guthrie (born January 4, 1962 in Grangemouth, Scotland) is a co-founder of Cocteau Twins, and is one of the principal songwriters and musicians. Robin's unique style of guitar-playing and songwriting — not to mention his deft production skills in the recording studio — have earned him the respect of musicians throughout the world.

Working at first with Will Heggie and, since, with Simon Raymonde, Robin has played guitar, bass, keyboards, drums and other instruments over the years, plus programming, sampling and sound processing.

Robin originally set-up the record label bella union with Simon and he now works and lives in France with his wife, Florence, and their two children. He is also the proud father of Lucy Belle, his daughter with Elizabeth Fraser.

In addition to his work as a producer (Lush) and engineer, Robin's latest musical collaboration is Violet Indiana, with singer Siobhan de Maré. Robin's first solo record, Imperial, was released in March 2003 by Bella Union.
