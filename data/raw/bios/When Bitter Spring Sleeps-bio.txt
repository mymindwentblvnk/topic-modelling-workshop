When Bitter Spring Sleeps is a folk metal band from Cedar Rapids, Iowa, currently consisting of Lord Sardonyx on all instruments and vocals. To date, the band has released three full-length albums, a demo, a split with Panopticon, and a digital anthology containing most of the songs from the demo and split. The band's early material was black metal, but the tremolo picking and harsh vocals are respectively toned down and completely absent on the band's full-length albums.
