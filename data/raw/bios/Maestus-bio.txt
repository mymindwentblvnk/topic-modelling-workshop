Dwelling amongst the moss and fog of the pacific northwest, Maestus have hidden in the gloom, toiling away for the last year on the songs comprising their Domestic Genocide debut and second release on Glossolalia Records. Following their 2013 EP, Scarlet Lakes, the band has adjusted their lineup to include members of cascadian black metal act, GRST and are poised to birth Voir Dire, a lush and expansive album for fans of Pallbearer and Ahab. 

Though influences throughout are broad, fans will hear subtle nods to the dire yet hopeful emotive vocal tendencies of Woods Of Ypres, as well forays into funeral doom akin to that of Evoken. Despite bearing notable, if obvious influences, Voir Dire presents a unique interpretation of doom that will demand as well as reward repeat listens. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Maestus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
