Skellington was singer/songwriter Britt Daniel's first band. Formed in 1990 in Austin, Texas, the band released three cassettes before disbanding in 1992. Later, Britt would go on to form Spoon.

Skellington recorded and self-released This Town's Gone Dry in 1991, and the Skellington EP was released a year later in 1992. Before breaking up, the band released Skellington Rex, which contained songs that were re-recorded on Spoon's debut album Telephono.
