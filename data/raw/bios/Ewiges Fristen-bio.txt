"Ewiges Fristen" was formed by Togura on a long summer night in 2002. Some first songs were recorded, like "Des Windes Melodie". Inspired by the woods, rivers and mountains of the surrounding, the first demo "Ewiges Fristen" was written. Everything was recorded in Togura's home studio. Bassist Freki joined the band later. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ewiges+Fristen">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
