Splendidula was formed in 2008 in Genk (Belgium).

The self-titled debut album “Splendidula” was recorded in 2013 and released on June 22th 2013.
After some serious line-up changes the music evolved to a mix of Post, Sludge & Doom metal, with some additional grunts for a heavier sound.

The current line-up consists of Kristien Cools (vocals), Pieter Houben (guitar & vocals), David Vandegoor (guitar), Peter Chromiak (bass) & Joachim Taminau (drums).

In 2017-2018 the latest album “Post Mortem” was recorded in the home studio of Splendidula, mixed and mastered by Hearse Studio.
The album is released on December 14th 2018, in collaboration with Inverse Records (Finland).

Meanwhile, Splendidula is already working on new material for a third album or EP. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Splendidula">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
