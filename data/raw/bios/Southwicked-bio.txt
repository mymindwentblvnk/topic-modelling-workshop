It actually all started when Allen West and Marco Vreven on the Lowbrow 'Buried in Europe' Tour decided to start a new band,and a couple of months later we were working on some songs and recorded a demotape in the Red Room Studio's in Ybor City. Rock Rollain (Kult of Thorn)joined our forces and he placed some mighty fine Basslines on our songs. Days before our first gig, we asked Sven Poets from Shattered Skull (BE) to join our forces. He learned everything in 3 days and was accepted as a bandmember!  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Southwicked">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
