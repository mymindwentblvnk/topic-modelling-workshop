Antti Martikainen is an independent composer from Finland. His style varies from folk and  new age to  trailer music and recently to folk metal/ symphonic metal. Regardless of style, his music is always instrumental and has an "epic", fantasy feel to it.

Martikainen uses his YouTube channel  to publish his music.  New tracks are uploaded whenever they are finished in his secret laboratory. He absorbs his artistic inspirations mainly from video game and movie soundtracks. Some good examples include Future World Music, Two Steps From Hell, Koji Kondo, Jeremy Soule, John Williams and Hans Zimmer. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Antti+Martikainen">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
