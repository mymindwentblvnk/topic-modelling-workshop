3. A contemporary death metal / progressive metal band from Rīga, Latvia formed by guitarist and drummer of band Exmort in year 2005.

Dislocation was formed in the fall of 2005 by bass player Rihard Vershinin and drummer Renat Ragimhanov. Since then the band has gone through numerous member changes, and Renat is the only member who has remained from the original line-up. The first rehearsals took place in a high school, but soon after the guys moved to bass player’s house where the fundamentals of band were set up. Due to the poor skills the band progressed very slowly at the early stage. The band was in search for new members, when Kaspars Putniņš joined the band on guitar and bringing in positive changes and contributing to the progress of the band. Dislocation (entitled ‘Exmort’ at the time) played at a number of gigs, performing songs quite different from the current repertoire – the guys even covered ‘Master of Puppets’. However, after some time all members except Renat and Kaspars parted way with the band. Despite that the guys persevered and looked forward to forming a new line-up once again, and continued to rehearse. They also came up with the title of the band – ‘Dislocation’ – which reflects the departure (‘Dis-’) from the meaningful rehearsing place (‘location’). Toms Krauklis joined the band on bass guitar at the time, a while later leaving Dislocation to join Frailty, and reuniting with the former and being a part of its current line-up. The last member to complete the current line-up was Oskars Vallis on guitar. At some point the band was considering the idea to involve female vocals, however, they faced difficulties finding any suitable member. The situation turned out to be the same with the male vocalists. Seeking for solutions Dislocation tried out different variations, and finally decided to move on performing the vocals by themselves. Dislocation independently recorded and released their first EP ‘XXIX’ in the fall of 2009 and more actively continued to play live gigs in Latvia and Vilnius (Lithuania), as well. In the beginning of 2011, the band released its latest album ‘Sagul’ which incorporates various musical genres thus maintaining the distinctive sound of Dislocation established in previous album and also offering a number of innovative nuances. 

Current lineup:

Kaspars Putniņš - guitar, vocals;
Oskars Vallis - guitar;
Toms Krauklis - bass guitar;
Renāts Ragimhanovs - drums, vocals.
