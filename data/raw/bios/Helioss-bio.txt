Helioss was born in early 2009 when Nico (guitar, bass, programming) decided to create a new musical project, more extreme than the ones he'd created until now. Inspired by Dimmu Borgir, Mirrorthrone and Anorexia Nervosa, but by classical and baroque music as well, he began to write songs. Then he asked Pierre (vocals) from Dividead to work with him. Pierre performs all vocals. Our first 6 titles EP can now be listened here. If you want to buy a copy (5â‚¬), please contact us at the adresse below.
