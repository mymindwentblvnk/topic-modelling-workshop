Breastfed off the gloomy atmosphere of Franz Kafka’s Prague, the Czech existential doom metal horde ET MORIEMUR (EM) was founded in February 2008.

Featuring ex-members of DISSOLVING OF PRODIGY, SILENT STREAM OF GODLESS ELEGY and members of SELF-HATRED, PANYCHIDA and OBLOMOV, the band released an EP (Lacrimae Rerum, 2009, self-released) and its debut full-length album (“Cupio Dissolvi”, 2011, Parat prod.).

The album received several positive reviews and EM ranked second in the 2011 edition of the “New Artist of the Year” Czech rock/metal publicists awards and played scores of gigs both in the Czech Republic and abroad, sharing the stage with such bands as MOURNFUL CONGREGATION, ESOTERIC, SATURNUS, WORSHIP, AHAB, ISOLE, OPHIS or MARCHÉ FUNEBRE and performing at prestigious festivals such as BRUTAL ASSAULT, GOTHOOM OPEN AIR (SK), DARKEN THE MOON (BE) and CZECH DEATH FEST.

EM also appeared in three compilations – “Institut černého kovu”, a tribute CD to the Czech black metal legends TÖRR, Doom Metal Front zine compilation “Eastern Doomination” and a tribute to the Czech doom metal masters DISSOLVING OF PRODIGY.

EM is the organizer of PATIOR ERGO SUM DOOM FEST, an annual doom event featuring fellow doom bands from all over Europe.

EM supports Svoboda zvířat (a Czech animal rights organization) with regular financial donations.
