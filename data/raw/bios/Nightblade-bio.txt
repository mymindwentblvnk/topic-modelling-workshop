===========================

(2) Nightblade were formed in March 2007. Rising from the ashes of former band Equalisis, making use of what they had musically and personally they went on the search for a new guitarist and after trying and failing with two they found Aidan Jones, third time lucky! It wasn't long before they hit the local scene (only a month and a single practice later infact) to wide acclaim. Competing in a local battle of the bands and procuring more gigs and a steadily growing fanbase.

Using the band members previous band and performance experiences they were led to having a very serious outlook in terms of producing and practicing music, rather than the somewhat more relaxed attitude that had been taken with previous bands.

The band then wrote and recorded demo versions of songs, which were posted on the internet site Myspace. The songs produced drew from a variety of styles of metal focusing mainly on the melodic styles of metal which all attracted positive feedback from the public. The songs all contain technical styles of playing with focus put onto instrument techniques, harmonies and melodies, and so they continue to write and gig with much more planned for the summer of 2007...
