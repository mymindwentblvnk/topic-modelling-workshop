There are two artists that use the name Technicolour

1.  Drum & Bass producer from the UK with releases on Technique and Ennex.
Technicolour (Peter Rogers) is a 30 year-old music producer originally from Luton, now based in the industrial leviathan that is Byfleet, Surrey. Also know as duet Technicolour & Komatic
He has been listening to fast electronic music ever since he tuned into Pressure FM in 1992 and heard Sonz Of A Loop Da Loop Era’s ‘Far Out’. His first musical purchase was the cassette version of The Bangles ‘Walk Like An Egyptian’, but in the interests of credibility we shall instead acknowledge his first ever vinyl purchase; Acen’s ‘Trip II The Moon’.
