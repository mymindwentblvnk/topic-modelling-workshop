1. Brute Force was a classic band with members from all over New York. They started in the early 1990's as an Oi! band, but like many other bands of this kind, they ended up more of an RAC band.

The band consisted of Ben on vocals, Chris on guitar, Lewis on rhythm guitar, Dave on bass (he also did the zine called Look to the future) and Tony on drums (take note that this is the 1994 lineup and there was a bit different lineup on their first demo).

They released their first demo called Out of the ashes in 1993, which got a good reception, and the label Oi! Core Records was showing interest in releasing their first EP. They also played live with many of the top names in the scene such as Anti-heros, Forced reality, Y.D.L. and Immoral discipline.

2. Brute Force, aka Stephen Friedland, is a writer, performer and producer of such cult pop items as 'The King Of Fuh' (a banned single released on The Beatles' Apple label) and the 'Confections Of Love' (featuring 'Tapeworm Of Love', 'Jim's Garage', 'No Olympian Heights' and 'Brute's Party')- perhaps the greatest 'lost' album of them all and one of the greatest pop records of any stripe. Brute was a one time Brill Building songwriter and penned 'Nobody Knows What's Going On In My Mind But Me' for The Chiffons amongst others.
