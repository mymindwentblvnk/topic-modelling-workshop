Are you tired of your dead-end, insignificant job? The never ending, monotonous routine of your life killing you a little more inside every day? Have you worn your nose down to a hideous, bloody pulp on the grindstone? Well suck it up, pansy - there’s WAY more where that came from. We All Have Day Jobs have arrived on the metal scene (they called up a buddy of theirs to work their shift) swearing to put in their two weeks with a sledgehammer. Featuring members of Ovum Lycanthropy and ex-Magnum Council and Choke, their style synthesizes the greatest elements in metal, jazz, and progressive music. Combining intense groove and an unconventional rhythmic approach with the power of death metal and classic thrash, We All Have Day Jobs promises to make you feel like your means of gainful employment really ISN’T that bad. Or make you violently bludgeon all of your co-workers with the fax machine just outside your cubicle. Probably the latter, honestly.
