Black metal band from Nicosia, Cyprus. Founded in 1991 by the vocalist Deceased, the band performed their first gig in 1993 and released the debut demo "Flowers" in 1994, gaining them some name in the underground circles.

More live appearances followed in 1995, supporting bands like Nightfall and Rotting Christ. The band gained notoriety on the local media for their use of human bones and self-mutilation during live performances. 1996-1997 were slower years spent writing material and rehearsing. 1998 they perform again with Rotting Christ and release a split 7"EP with Macabre Omen on Demonion Productions. 

The band's debut (and only) full-lenght album "Those Funeral Times" was recorded in the summer 1998 and released on Deceased's label Throne Productions in late 1998. A 1999 release was supposed to follow but apparently the band split up before that was recorded.
Line-up on the album was:
Deceased - vocals
Adorian - guitar & bass
Konstantinos - guitar
Panas - drums <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Godblood">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
