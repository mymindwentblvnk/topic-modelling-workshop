WHO IN HELL IS THIS BAND H.A.T.E.?


Spawned in an era when heavy metal was birthing the likes of metal greats like Metal Church, Slayer, Metallica to name a few, H.A.T.E. was already on top of the game in 1988 and produced an impressive collection of metal masterpieces that can still raise a metal fans fist in 2008.

Taking their music to many eastern states, H.A.T.E. thundered their way into the ears and minds of the heavy metal culture opening for powerful acts like Metal Church, Saxon, Overkill, and many more with an overwhelming response.

A few years passed and the band, never realizing their full potential along with the ushering in of the grunge movement, parted company like so many great metal / rock bands did at that time.

With the silence echoing loudly for nearly 17 years, the beast that is H.A.T.E. has awakend from its slumber more determined, more focused, and hungrier than ever to bring the sound and style they proudly call their own, to the forefront of an ever-increasing music scene.

Breathing new life into an extensive library of music, H.A.T.E. self released their debut album "Metal Forever" in July of 2007. The album has won praise among the metal masses, along with extremely positive reviews that serve as a testament to what H.A.T.E. can, and will do to deliver top shelf metal and for the fans to accept nothing less! Their in your face style of bone crushing metal will capture you from the first note and hold you hostage till the end. This is H.A.T.E.
