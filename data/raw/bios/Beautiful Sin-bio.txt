Back in 2002 former Helloween drummer, in Masterplan at the time, Uli Kusch met a Belgian singer called Magali Luyten. Magali wanted to record an album with her band and Uli agreed to produce it. The album was completed but never picked up by a label and therefore never saw a release. The band has since dissolved, but Uli remember Magali, and when he wanted to start a new band parallel to Masterplan, he called her up.

This new band became Beautiful Sin, and the line-up is completed by Jorn Viggo Lofstad (Jorn/Pagan’s Mind) on guitar, Steinar Krokmo (Pagan’s Mind) on bass, Axel Mackenrott (Masterplan) on keyboards and of course Uli on drums.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Beautiful+Sin">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
