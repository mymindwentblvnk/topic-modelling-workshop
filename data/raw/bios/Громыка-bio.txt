Gromyka are a rock band formed in Russia, in 2014. The band's name refers to Gromyko, former USSR's Foreign Minister and the word "gromko" - loudly. 
To define their music, Gromyka coined the term 'heavy psychedelic twist': the songs imagine Soviet 1960s - 1970s official cultural archetypes as seen in a distorting psychedelic trip, emphasising the music's futuristic paranoia. The already bizarre albeit tuneful blend of heavy garage rock, Italo Disco and Soviet Estrada is overlaid with beeping Sputnik sounds of Stylophone 350s and glockenspiel ostinato. Vocals are declamatory and formidable, as though delivered from the party rostrum. Absurd lyrics are given an absolutely deadpan delivery.
Since their first gig in 2014 Gromyka have caused controversy with their stage appearance - official grey suits and painted eyebrows reminiscent of the Brezhnev-era Politburo but the band denies any political involvement.
In March 2016 Gromyka released their first album on the major Russian label, Soyuz Music. Since then, there has been praise from critics and audiences seeking innovation, vitality and a cheerful madness in music.
Rolling Stone magazine concluded that the 'conceptually faultless band is well thought-out on every level', and awarded the album a prestigious 4 stars. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/%D0%93%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BC%D1%8B%D0%BA%D0%B0">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
