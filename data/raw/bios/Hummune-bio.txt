What other people have to say about Hummune:

‚ÄùCongratulations on your band! I like what you guys are doing! You have avoided the pitfall of so many bands these days that choose to incorporate trends of today's metal. I can tell that rather than trying to sound like a particular band, the focus is instead on simply writing something heavy and aggressive based on more timeless techniques! Fantastic!!!"

Good stuff, sounds like Biohazard, meets Sepultura with a bit of Killing Joke mixed in, I like it!
