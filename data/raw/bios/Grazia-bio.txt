Grazia Peretz, Jaffa, Israel Psychedelic Folk singer, was a young Israeli teen star way ahead of her time in accordance with her unsuccessful debut release, Grazia!, a record now seen as an infamous 70′s musical gem. Resurrected from the dark, Fortuna Records reissue the album in 2013.  Recorded when Grazia was only 16, her debut was released through Koliphone Records and, accompanied by keyboard player Marko Bachar, featured a folk foundation fused with many radical Moog synth textures and disco grooves. Due to its outlandish style, it sadly wasn’t popularized at the time.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Grazia">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
