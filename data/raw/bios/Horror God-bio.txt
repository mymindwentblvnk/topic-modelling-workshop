Horror God was founded in 2006 year with the pieces of the collectives Harrogath and Portal-Z. From the beginning the group has a lot of experiments in the stile Black/Death, but that what we have done is difficult to relate with any definited stile.

Text’s theme is not usual for such a music. We try to look at the problems of nowadays socium from the filosophic point of view. The music of Horror Gog is a mirror and maybe there you will see yourself and hear your thoughts, or maybe begin to hate.

In 2007 the collective records demo “Indifference.Freedom.Weakness” in home conditions ,but decided not to release it. In march 2008 the group begins to record their first album Cold Shine at Primordial studio. At the moment the album is completely finished. The collective is actively looking for label, which will release this album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Horror+God">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
