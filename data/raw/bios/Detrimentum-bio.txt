Detrimentum are re-focused, re-vamped and prepared to unleash a stellar opus of death metal dominance with "INHUMAN disgRACE." Heavy, progressive, melodic and technical, all without straying from the band's trademark bleak fury.
 
With the recent addition of Steve Powell (Anaal Nathrakh) on drums, Detrimentum are tighter than ever. 

“INHUMAN disgRACE" lays waste to to their 2008 debut, “Embracing This Deformity." With legendary producer Russ Russell (Dimmu Borgir, Napalm Death) at the helm, 2012 looks set to take a ferocious pummelling with “INHUMAN disgRACE.” <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Detrimentum">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
