Having lived on four continents before the age of eighteen, Fore was exposed to a wide range of cultures and experiences that allowed him a culturally pliant sense of self that is reflected in his music, which mines samples from wide- ranging influences like the Cocteau Twins and Maliâ€™s Amadou and Miriam.
Lyrically, Fore's work is punctuated by complex rhyme schemes that betray a childhood affinity for Big L, Big Pun and Nas with a modern sense of emotional honesty and artistic ambition.

His first album, Going Back is Not the Same as Staying is available for Free Download here:
