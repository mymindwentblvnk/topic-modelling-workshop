The Gentle Storm is the collaboration between Ayreon mastermind Arjen Anthony Lucassen and former The Gathering singer Anneke Van Giersbergen. They plan to release their first album in early 2015, with Ed Warby (Gorefest) playing drums.

Known for touring extensively year after year, Anneke will take The Gentle Storm on the road backed by well known Dutch talents. Arjen, however, will not be part of the live production. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Gentle+Storm">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
