Black metal band from Trondheim, Norway

Sarath come forth from the cold winter of 2001. It all started out as an experiment in digital recording. But then they decided to keep on recording their ideas. Since 2001 Sarath has recorded approximately 40 tracks of black and death metal.

As for now, 9 tracks have been released on cd, and the rest remains unreleased for now.

Sarath has contributed to the Tormenting Legends II compilation (Blut & Eisen, 2006) with the exclusive track 'Lengsel'. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sarath">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
