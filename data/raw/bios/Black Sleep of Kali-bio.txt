Black Sleep Of Kali's goal is to play heavy music that still retains melody, with a focus on getting awesome guitar tone from high-wattage, tube amplifiers. In winter 2008 BSOK recorded a 5 song EP with Andy Paterson (Eagle Twin, Gaza, Ascend)  which was independently released on Aug 1 2009. Black Sleep Of Kali released their debut record called Our Slow Decay on Small Stone Records in March 2010. They are currently working on writing songs for their next release and playing shows from time to time.

I may 2010 This Charming Man Records is releasing our Slow decay on Vinyl. It is a limited release of 500 copies.

Black Sleep Of Kali derives their influences from bands such as Black Sabbath, Torche, Goatsnake, Entombed, High On Fire, The Melvins and more.
