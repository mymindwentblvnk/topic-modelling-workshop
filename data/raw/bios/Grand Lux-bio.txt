Grand Lux was formed in Kristiansand Norway, by Ran Dee, Kirk Evin and B.D. Hughes in early 1999. Inspired by classic metal bands such as Dio, Kiss, Ozzy Ozbourne and Judas Priest, Grand Lux embarked upon their journey in the realms of Heavy Metal. 

It didn't take long for Grand Lux to get well known in the local scene, thanks to their excellent musicianship, and of course their impressive live shows, filled with fire, pyro-effects and powerful heavy metal. 

Late 2004, Grand Lux released their debut album, "Iron Will" on Norwegian Sand Records. The album got a great response from all over the world, and the demand for the band to play live increased heavily. Since the beginning, Grand Lux has played some great festivals - The Quart Festival included, Norway's largest music festival. 

Early 2006, Grand Lux started to work on songs for a new album. The band came in contact with Sweden's Ulterium Records, and during summer 2006 a contract was signed. In November, Grand Lux entered Dub Studios in Kristiansand with Endre Kirkesola as engineer. 

The result of this recording - the progression since "Iron Will" is overwhelming, the new album "Carved In Stone," is far superior that it's precursor. Grand Lux here delivers an album filled with great 80's Heavy Metal, and no fan of the genre will be dissapointed. Great musicianship, catchy and well written songs, and an excellent, crystal clear production makes this album a winner. 

Grand Lux will surely continue their victory crusade around the world in the coming years. With a great album such as "Carved in stone," and their world-class live show, they simply can't fail. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Grand+Lux">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
