Jordy Leenaerts, better known by the stage name Timecop1983, is a Dutch electronic musician from Eindhoven, producing music in the synthwave genre. His debut album, Childhood Memories, was released in 2014, followed by Journeys in the same year. The albums Reflections and Night Drive were released in 2015 and 2018, respectively. He explained in an interview that his stage name came about as a combination of Futurecop! and his year of birth, not realizing the Timecop film and franchise existed until about a year later.

The Timecop1983 experience has always displayed the subtle sensitivities of Synth Romance in most of his works, which is always surprising as one would expect a much more aggressive and frenetic synthscape with a name like Timecop1983. It goes to show how wrong you are and that judging books (or producers in this case), by their cover is always a mistake. 

His music is created to take you back to the '80s in a dreamy/romantic fashion. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Timecop1983">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
