Notorius was a widely unknown Hardcore band with a gothy touch from Italy, active in the late 90s. The played a furiously mad style of goth-influenced hardcore, going well unnoticed by the scene in spite of some great records that play in the same league as Locust, The VSS, Angelhair, Pleasure Forever, while creating a very unique "Italian" style of playing this kind of music.
