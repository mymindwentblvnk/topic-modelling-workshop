Equal parts Eno, Mum and Mogwai. His songs construct equally barren landscapes: "Aidos" burbles up from nothing and swells into a circle of warm, chiming guitars, evoking what it must be like to float on your back in the Gulf of Mexico without another soul for miles; the waterlogged, percolating synths of "Kt" approximate the best beatless moments of Boards Of Canada, or at least an instrumental B-side from Kid A. Bexar Bexar often contributes music to dress the scenes on NPR's "This American Life," and it's easy to see why. Haralambos makes perfect background music for quiet, reflective moments: reading a book, lying in the dark, imagining you're the last person on earth.
