Born in the UK to Indian-mother and Jamaican father, Iris Gold grew up and currently lives in Denmark, and she is not the typical pop artist you would think at first impression. She is a singer, a rapper and a hippie.

Iris Gold’s music is a fusion of past and modernity, a truthful reflection of her personal upbringing, her musical influences and life philosophy. Creative, hype and sensitive, Iris was raised in Christiania and lived around Copenhagen squatting with her mum as a young girl. A colourful, creative childhood that, on one hand, enhanced her artistic flair and made her the inspiring singer she is today, on the other, it made her mature quickly as she had to face the challenge of being “different”. In fact, as open and modern as it may seem, Denmark is a tough country to live in for dark-skinned people, especially in terms of representation. Nevertheless, proud of her music, her achievements and her glorious afro, Iris Gold is finally representing a role model herself, the one she wish she had when she was a young girl. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Iris+Gold">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
