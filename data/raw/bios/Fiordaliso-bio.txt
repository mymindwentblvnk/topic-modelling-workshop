Marina Fiordaliso, best known as Fiordaliso, is an Italian pop-rock singer.

Born in Piacenza, the daughter of a drummer, Fiordaliso approached music at young age studying voice and piano. In 1981 she won the Castrocaro Music Festival with the song Scappo via, and the following year she debuted at the Sanremo Music Festival with the reggae-rock ballad Una sporca poesia. Her major successes, remarkably the songs Oramai and Non voglio mica la luna (written by Zucchero Fornaciari), are linked to the Sanremo Festival, in which she participated nine times between 1982 and 2002; outside the Festival, her main hit was the song Cosa ti farei, one of the most successful songs of the Summer 1990 in Italy. In the 90s Fiordaliso gradually moved away from the musical scenes without never abandoning them, but focusing on the activities of stage actress and television presenter.

She has 2 children, Sebastiano born in 1973, and Paolino in 1989.
