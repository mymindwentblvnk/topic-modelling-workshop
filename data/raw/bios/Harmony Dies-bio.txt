Harmony Dies is a Death Metal Band found in 1992 in Berlin/Germany. Since then we worked in the underground to become one of the most brutal bands here in Germany.

The first two demos were released in 1992 and in 1993, "LIVING CORPSES" and "SLOPE".
One year later the split-single with Krisiun from Brasil appeared on MORBID RECORDS.
Following the demos "THIRD OUTPUT OF INCOMPETENCE" in 1994 and "PROMO '95" the first self-produced MCD "SLAUGHTERED" was recorded in 1996.

It took more than two years until the first full length CD "DON'T TRUST" was released on ARS METALLI.
In the year 2000 Harmony Dies entered the SOUNDFORGE STUDIO once again to record "I'LL BE YOUR MASTER" with the help of ANDREAS HILBERT.
The following year saw the appearance of the live video "DYING LIVE" and in 2002 followed the "HYBRID MANIFESTATION" 7"-single with the guys from SPAWN on POSERSLAUGHTER RECORDS.

For 2003 We had recorded the CD " Impact" , brought to you by Morbid Records, and we take place on a split CD with Fleshart from greece.

The band's line-up changed several times, but we never changed our attitude: To create brutal music!!

Harmony Dies is a live band and tries to play as often as possible. So we already had shows with bands like Vader, Deeds of Flesh, In Flames, Dying Fetus, Deranged, Krisiun, The Haunted, Incantation, Mayhem and lots of others.
