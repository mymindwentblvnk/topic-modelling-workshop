Funin are a Norwegian seven piece band which sounds like a cross breed between Robert Wyatt, Radiohead and Caravan. They have just released their debut album Unsound

Funin started as a electronica duo consisting of Øyvind Vie Berg and Marit Elisabeth Svendsbøe.
They met each other in january 2005 and they immediately started to make music.
Their music where played on the radio in Norway and abroad.
As the years went by they found several live band members. Aleksander Tveit(guitar), Sissel Ørstavik(violin),
Edvard Mjanger(bass/contra bass), Audun Berg Selfjord(cello) and Hans Christian Dalgaard(drums).
Gaute Stedje and Mats Mæland Jensen came into the band when Hans Christian and Aleksander quit.
Mats became the new drummer and Gaute became the third songwriter in the band.  

The lyrics on the album (Unsound) are written by Marit Elisabeth and it`s both dark and optimistic. She write about loneliness, anxiety, grief, depression and hope. She writes both about her own experiences and to her friends.
She often writes metaphorically.
