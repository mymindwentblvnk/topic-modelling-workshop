Brittany Fousheé, known simply as Fousheé (pronounced foo-shay), is a singer-songwriter from Harlem, New York. She participated in the 15th season of The Voice, where her blind audition of the song "Redbone" by Childish Gambino made two seats turn, she got a place in Adam Levine's team and later, due to her vocal quality, she jumped onto the global scene. .
 
Her love for music stemmed from her mother, who was a drummer for PEP, an all-female Jamaican reggae band. Since she was little she was introduced to this art by listening to artists like Bob Marley, and with influences from Chaka Khan to Frank Ocean. All this resulted in a sound that oscillates between R&B and neo soul, fresh and different from the one we know. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Foushe%C3%A9">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
