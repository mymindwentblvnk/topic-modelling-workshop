Sombre Chemin is an entity dedicated to the memory of our ancestors, to the cult of Blood, to the fight against the system in power today and for the Pagan revival in our European lands. We do not support the old decadent nationalisms that have benefitted only the enemies of the Hyperboreans by always pushing us to shed the blood of a fellow Hyperborean. Our vision is the one of Blood Nations in a Europe freed from all influences of the desert.

The lyrics are written in French, a language that on the one hand, is a perfect match for our music, and on the other hand for it's value identity-wise in this cosmopolitan world, but without falling into the trap of chauvinism.
Sombre Chemin's music is a burst of hate against our enemies, and a call to resist for our allies. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sombre+Chemin">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
