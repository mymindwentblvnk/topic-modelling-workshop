S.A.Slayer, originally known as Slayer, was an American heavy metal band formed in San Antonio, Texas in 1981 by the former Blitzkrieg (not to be confused with the UK band Blitzkrieg) guitar duo Robert "Bob Dog" Catlin and Art Villarreal, future Riot bassist Don Van Stavern, drummer Dave McClain, and vocalist Chris Cronk (Fates Warning, Jag Panzer, Karion, Talisphere, Target 7). The latter was soon replaced by Steve Cooper and the band signed a record deal with local upstart label Rainforest Records and proceeded to record six songs for a proposed EP at B.O.S.S. Studios with producer/engineer duo Bob O'Neill and Rick Shrieves. The Prepare to Die EP was released in 1983 and "Slayer" became one of the top metal draws of the Texas scene. The band changed their name to S.A. Slayer following a cease and desist lawsuit from founder of Metal Blade Records, Brian Slagel on behalf of thrash metal legends Slayer.

S.A. SLAYER, previously known simply as SLAYER, this Texan based band prefixed their title with the name of their home city when confusion arose with the more prominent Los Angeles Thrashers of the same name. Famously, both SLAYER's - the Los Angeles version and the San Antonio version, shared a stage in 1985 at the Cameo Theater in San Antonio with support from MILITIA.

Guitarist Art Villareal, who played on the 1983 'Prepare To Die' EP (released as Slayer), was replaced Ron Jarzombek who recorded the 'Go For The Throat' LP as S.A. Slayer in 1984. At this juncture the shadow of their more famous Californian counterparts loomed large and a consideration was made to re-brand these recordings under the band billing SCYTHIAN PREY. However, the album finally emerged in 1988 credited to S.A. SLAYER.

Following the albums, Jarzombek recorded with studio project the HAPPY KITTIES with his brother Bobby on drums. A mostly instrumental demo had been recorded with Jason McMaster of WATCHTOWER guesting on 'Hammer At The Ready' and Mike Grotheus of WINTERKAT on 'In Mind'.

Bassist Don Van Stavern forged the MARK REALE PROJECT with RIOT guitarist Mark Reale. This project then became known as NARITA, as vocalist Steve Cooper and drummer Dave McClain also became incolved. Von Stavern would join RIOT once Reale had resurrected his cult outfit. The bassist's later works included SUITE 16, including drummer Bobby Jarzombek and ex-WINTERKAT and DIRTY WATER guitarist Jonathan Grell issuing an album, and JACK RUBY, again alongside Bobby Jarzombek and his erstwhile S.A. SLAYER colleague Art Villareal on guitar, for a three song demo.

Following on from his NARITA tenure, Cooper briefly joined East Coast Progressive Metal outfit EXPLORER (a.k.a. EXXPLORER), post the 'Symphonies Of Steel' album. He also sang on the second JUGGERNAUT album, 'Trouble Within.' Dave McClain's subsequent NARITA stops would be CATALEPSY, the TURBIN band of ex-ANTHAX singer NEIL TURBIN and MINISTERS OF ANGER in alliance with a pre-DAMN THE MACHINE's Dave Clemmons, the latter act featuring on the 'Metal Massacre 'XI' compilation album.

Guitarist Ron Jarzombek reared his head again in 1997 with the SPASTIK INK album 'Ink Complete'. Don Van Stavern turned up in 1992 as one of the instigators behind the Industrial Techno outfit PITBULL DAYCARE. Drummer Dave McClain later journeyed through SACRED REICH and MACHINE HEAD. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/S.A.+Slayer">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
