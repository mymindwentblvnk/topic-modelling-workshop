Michael Christmas was born on a cold New Year's Eve. But because the calendar wasn't invented at that time, the doctor wrote December 25th as his birthday. Michael had to live with that mistake ever since. The town kept calling him Michael Christmas but they should've called him Michael New Year's Eve. Every Michael Christmas album has been released on a New Year's Eve, but the people kept calling him Michael Christmas. He has worked with Mac Miller (also known as Macklemore) and several other REMEMBER music artists, including but not limited to: Njomza.
He has released an album called: What a weird Day, which he released on an ordinary day, making buyers wonder about what Michael was talking. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Christmas">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
