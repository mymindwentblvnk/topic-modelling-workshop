Soulgate's Dawn was formed (originally as Mr. Burn), August 2001 in Germany, by members of Quickshot and Brainflakes. After some local performances, the band extended their fame on a supra-regional level because of their aggressive but at the same time melodic sound. After some line-up changes the band got a replacement by John (Fall Of serenity bass & vocals) and Paula (bass), who completed the (topic-) line-up. To customize their music to a common run of a mankind they worked in a studio to record their first Mini-CD in summer 2003. For a qualitatively high result they put the recording in the hands of Patrick W. Engel (of Rape Of Harmonies Studios in Triptis). The song "Observe The Sky" on the Mini-CD (mentioned above), appears additionally on the Circulation Records Labelsampler 03, which also contains songs from bands like Heaven Shall Burn, Narziss and Faust Again. The aim of Soulgate's Dawn, is to constantly widen their life presence. After a successful promotion of their demo, Soulgate's Dawn signed to Circulation Records in December 2003, which gave them the opportunity to record their full-length debut album called "Stardust" in May 2004. After many good press reactions and tons of shows with bands like Heaven Shall Burn, Caliban, Cataract, Napalm Death, Maroon, Ektomorf, A Traitor Like Judas, Deadlock, As We Fight, Bridge To Solace, Walls Of Jericho, Neaera, Deadsoil, Liar and Purification, the band entered the Rape Of Harmonies Studio once again, to record their second album.
They disbanded in 2011. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Soulgate%27s+Dawn">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
