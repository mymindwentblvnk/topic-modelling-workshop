Sempiternal Deathreign was a death metal band from Gouda, Netherlands.  Alongside its "death/doom" style, the band is identifiable as the point of origin for members of future Dutch death metal projects Thanatos and Sinister, as well as the lesser known Eternal Solstice and Mourning.

In 1987, the band formed and released an untitled rehearsal demo, which was followed by the Creepshow demo in 1988.  Two songs from this demo, "Devastating Empire Towards Humanity" and "Unperceptive Life," were retooled for the band's 1989 full-length debut, The Spooky Gloom.

Judging by the appearance of its members in other bands, Sempiternal Deathreign likely split in either 1989 or 1990.  Their particular brand of the "death/doom" style, evident on The Spooky Gloom, died with them; the style on a whole, however, was to be continued by their more famous countrymen. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sempiternal+Deathreign">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
