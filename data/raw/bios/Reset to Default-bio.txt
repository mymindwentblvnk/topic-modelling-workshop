Reset To Defult (R.T.D) are from Ankara, Turkey. The project was launched in 2002 by Cagri Karaer and Emrecan Yilmaz. They recorded two demos so far. The second demo is titled ''Visions Of Self Destruction''. 

R.T.D's sound is a more modern style of hardcore. They use elements of metal, incorporated with double kick drumming and agressive metal riffs to form a much heavier style than usual hardcore. They have also adopted Swedish and Florida style of metal, using death riffs, combined with their hardcore sound. They use emotional clean vocals combined with hardcore screaming and soft melodic passages.
