Scheitan from Luleå, Sweden was formed in 1996 by Pierre Törnkvist (ex-The Everdawn) and Oscar Karlsson (ex-Gates Of Ishtar). They released 3 albums. 

"Travelling in Ancient Times" (1996)
"Berzerk 2000" (1998)
"Nemesis" (1999)

While their debut was primarilly black metal, the second effort showed the band's progression so that their third effort could be described as Goth Death'n Roll... The band has meanwhile split up (in 2000?). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Scheitan">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
