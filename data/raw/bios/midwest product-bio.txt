Operating in the growing hybrid genre of electro-rock, Midwest Product combines live instrumentation with electronics to create music which is both danceable and engaging. Tight, witty, and intelligent, this is electronic with an indie rock soul; taking the best of both worlds to form something new yet familiar. The Ann Arbor, MI based trio - Ben Mullins (electronics/guitar), Chad Pratt (Drums) and Drew Schmieding (bass/keys)- released their debut album, Specifics, on Ghostly International in 2002.

Following positive reviews from such publication as Time out: New York and Urb plus solid college radio play, and as one of the only traditional "bands" on Ghostly, Midwest Product seek crossover acclaim from both electro and indie-rock fans. Expanding their palate to include vocals and a more edgy production approach on World Series of Love, Midwest Product continue to refine their brand of indie-pop with assembly-line precision and glossy electro sheen. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Midwest+Product">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
