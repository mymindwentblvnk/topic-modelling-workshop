Although Obelisk was officially formed in May of 2013, the concept had been stirring for years. Attempting to find a suitable outlet for his progressive musical ideas, Ezekiel Kaplan formed and dissolved two bands before finally deciding to move to California, where his drummer friend, Caleb Hay, was himself searching for a new, more challenging and musically fulfilling band. In the San Francisco Bay area the two auditioned a number of guitarists but failed find the right chemistry. 

Chatting with friends from Pittsburgh about his failed search, Ezekiel finally realized that his Pittsburgh acquaintance, bassist Devan Procopio, shared his musical philosophy and ambition. They quickly began trading recorded riffs and expanding on each other’s ideas. Ezekiel convinced Caleb to drive with him back to Pittsburgh back in late March of 2013 and soon after, the two began practicing with Devan. The three threw ideas around for a second guitarist but couldn’t seem to find anyone who fit their musical ideas. One night, at a Steven Wilson concert, Ezekiel introduced Devan to his old co-worker Dan Winschel, who shared their love for prog and was looking for a band himself. They scheduled an audition, and after only one jam session it was obvious to all that something special had been discovered.

The band has played various venues around Pittsburgh and recorded a demo, which can be found digitally on obeliskofficial.bandcamp.com or can be bought at any Obelisk show. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Obelisk">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
