Liquido was a rock band formed in Germany in 1996 by the four friends Wolle Maier (drums), Wolfgang Schr√∂dl (vocals, guitar, piano), Stefan Schulte-Holthaus (bass) and Tim Eiermann (vocals, guitar). 

Their only notable international hit, "Narcotic", was first released on a demo in 1996 and sold over 700.000 units when Virgin Records re-released it in 1998. Since then, Liquido hasn't been able to repeat this success, which led to a split from Virgin after two unsuccessful albums in 2004 and finally to the breakup of the band in 2009.

Tim Eiermann is known to be founding member of Death/Doom Metal act Pyogenesis, which released its first EP Ignis Creatio in 1992 through Osmose Productions. Wolle Maier also played in Pyogenesis. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Liquido">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
