Ursula Bogner (b. 1946) is a German musician and composer of electronic music.

Born and brought up in Dortmund, Bogner went to study Pharmacy in Berlin when she was nineteen.  She started work at a large German pharmaceutical  company, where she had a successful career in tandem with her role as wife and mother.  She also developed a keen interest in electronic music, following the work of the Studio für elektronische Musik in Köln, and attending seminars given by Herbert Eimert.

Her enthusiasm for musique concrète was later joined by that for British new-wave pop, but she kept her own music private. She tried a huge variety of techniques, and when - in the late 1960s - she began to record some of her work on a reel-to-reel tape recorder, it was in a great variety of styles.

Some of her music was finally released on his own label by Jan Jelinek. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ursula+Bogner">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
