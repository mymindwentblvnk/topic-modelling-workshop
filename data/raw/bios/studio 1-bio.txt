This label (and also act) was founded by Wolfgang Voigt in the early 90's in Cologne. It was a series of ten records, which were made to show the world what minimal techno in its essence is. Each of the records had a different color and each of them was made by and released on Studio 1. The tracks and the records had no names. After this 10 releases a cd compilation followed with some unreleased tracks as well. After a long time of silence (when Voigt spent time with some of his other projects) the act Studio 1 was reactivated. Studio 1 now releases on the mother label Profan, as "Studio 1 ist eine abteilung von Profan Schallplatten KÃ¶ln."
