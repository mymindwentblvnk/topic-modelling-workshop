Founded in 2011, Petrol Patrol rapidly starts writing songs, which are already played early 2012. During the summer of 2012, the recording of its first 5-track EP named ‘Domestic Warfare’, takes place. The EP is mixed and mastered by the excellent Christoph Noth (Arkhan, The Burden Remains), and is self-released early 2013. Petrol Patrol plays a fresh and diversified thrash metal, influenced by bans such as Exodus, Megadeth and Slayer, but also Forbidden, The Haunted, At The Gates and even Suffocation, Vile and Biohazard. Planning on recording a second EP, the band is actively looking for shows in order to deliver its energy on stage.
