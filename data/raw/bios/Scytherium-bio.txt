Emerging from a deep silence in the Florida metal scene, Scytherium brings haunting melodies and symphonic visions to life in eclectic yet inspired music. Merging elements from all spectrums of music, from the raw to the orchestral, Scytherium is a unique presence in the U.S. black metal pantheon. Thematic explorations range from the mysteries of the dead, haunting tales of malevolent ghosts, and the personal acceptance of a morbid fascination with darkness. Conceptual material and twisted storytelling meld with atmosphere and brutality to bring a new generation of symphonic black metal to the forefront. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Scytherium">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
