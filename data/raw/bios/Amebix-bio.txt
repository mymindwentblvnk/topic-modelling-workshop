Amebix were a crust punk band from England. Formed as "The Band with No Name", Amebix's original run was from 1978 to 1987, during which time they released three EPs and two full-length LPs, before reuniting in 2008 and disbanded again in 2012.

By being one of the first bands to blend anarcho-punk and heavy metal music, Amebix are often cited as one of the key bands that helped to create the crust punk style, and are considered as a proto-thrash metal band. Such notable bands as Sepultura, Neurosis, and Deviated Instinct have paid homage. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Amebix">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
