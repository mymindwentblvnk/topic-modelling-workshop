Horsepower Productions, alongside El-B, are widely seen as the earliest pioneers of the  Dubstep genre in London, UK. Their debut LP (more aptly, a compilation), In Fine Style, was released in November 2002 and was a collection of 6 new tracks (with a bonus re-issue of Gorgon Sound). The CD contained these seven tracks and a collection of other Horsepower 12"s now mainly out of press. In 2004, they released their first studio album, To the Rescue. After a six-year hiatus, they returned in 2010 with a new album, Quest For The Sonic Bounty. 

Until the end of 2002 Horsepower Productions were collectively Benny Ill, Nassis and Lev Jnr. They now operate as a two man outfit minus Nasis, who is concentrating on Drum & Bass and other production work. Whether Horsepower is one, two or three people, they've delighted and surprised with their innovative approach to production. What is most apparent is perhaps the diversity of musical influence. All born-and-bred Londoners, the roots of Horsepower's sound is as culturally diverse as the city's inhabitants. Their inspiration is drawn from UK garage, techno, house, dub, broken-beat, hip-hop, reggae, D&B, funk, sound and a selection of global film samples. Their importance in the creation of the dubstep genre is acknowledged by the inclusion of two of their tracks on the compilation, The Roots of Dubstep

Benny Ill has been producing music for the past 10 years under various alias"s including the dub laced sounds of Bill & Ben. Benny is also a regular DJ at Drive By and Wicked in NYC & Forward in the UK. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Horsepower+Productions">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
