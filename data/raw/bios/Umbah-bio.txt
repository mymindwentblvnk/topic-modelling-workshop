UMBAH, an avant-garde extreme-metal project born in 1990 from the ashes of UK's death/grind act Necrosanct. Syringing the mechanical, alienating coldness of industrial metal into a deformed death/grind hulk, Umbah gives life to a Frankenstein's metal monster that speaks a unique musical language, progressive and breathtaking  and unique.  Complex arrangements, alien song-structures, weird industrial sounds, schizophrenic vocals, dark and disturbing melodies, glitchy contaminations and decomposed interludes..

So far recorded the following albums:
'CONTINUUM', 'SOLARIS' , 'XOMINOD', '7 DAYS OF HORROR' , 'OBLITICUS' , 'SLAIN', 'OCTUPI', 'CANVAS', 'ALIEN BEAUTY', 'GRIMLOCK SARIS', 'TRILOBETH',  'ARADROLOS' 'ENTER THE DAGOBAH CORE' 'A SNARLY TANGLED QUANDARY'
