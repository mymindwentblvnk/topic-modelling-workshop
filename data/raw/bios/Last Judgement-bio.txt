We are a 5 piece thrash metal band from Dublin.We are in the middle of recording our upcoming debut album which is due for release later on in the year .

We have been gigging since January just gone and have played with the country's best metal bands.
Our sound is kinda a mix of technical metal mixed with old school trash.

We try to gig at least once a month so try get yourself and a few of the mates to one of the gigs and give us a listen and support the underground metal scene. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/last+judgement">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
