There are two bands named "Terracide".

1. Out of Minneapolis, Minnesota, Terracide is currently playing DIY shows to build our street cred. Next year we're going to make it big. If we don't, we'll change our sound to something more accessible to a mainstream audience.

Noah Bleeder - Bass
Erik Bov√© - Skins
Skorpiain - Axe
Mike Pudd'nhead - Screams and Axe
