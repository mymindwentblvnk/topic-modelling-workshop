Katriana Huguet better known by her stage name Kat Dahlia, is a Cuban-American singer and songwriter known for her "razor sharp" lyrics and her unique, aggressive flow.

After self-financing an EP and a music video, Dahlia was brought to the attention of veteran record executive Sylvia Rhone by A&R representative Amanda Berkowitz. In 2012, describing Dahlia as "more than just a pop artist," Rhone signed her to her newly-launched label, Vested In Culture (VIC), a joint venture with Epic Records. Dahlia's debut album is set to come out in 2013, and will be VIC's inaugural release. 

Dahlia's first single and video for VIC is the track "Gangsta", which MTV called "filled to the brim with fierce rapping". Shot in Miami, the video for "Gangsta" reflects the difficulties of her earlier life. The video, which was directed by Samantha Lecca, premiered on Vevo on March 5, 2013, and Dahlia was selected as a BET "Music Matters" artist.

Dahlia digitally released three songs, "Gangsta", "Money Party", and "Mirror" on March 5, 2013. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kat+Dahlia">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
