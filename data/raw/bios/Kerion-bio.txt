Kerion is a French symphonic power metal band, with female vocals, strongly influenced by Rhapsody.

Back in 1997, Kerion was an instrumental prog metal band at this time called Kirlian. A female singer, Flora, then joins the lineup and Kerion heads towards symphonic metal and releases two demos conceptually based on a heroic-fantasy tale written by Chris Barberi.
"Conspiracy of Darkness"
"The Last Sunset"
In 2008, the first album Holy Creatures Quest is released. It is based on the last part of Barberi's "Staraxis" novel. The second album The Origins follows in 2010 and focuses on the beginning of Barberiâ€™s tale. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kerion">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
