Korr originated in Moosic, Pennsylvania and is comprised of Matt Korr (founder and guitarist/vocalist), John Musky (drummer), Mike McHugh (keys), and Ryan Korr (bassist). In the past, Korr has played with Gwar, Nile, Immolation, Solient Green, Eye Hate God, Dry Kill Logic, Vital Remains, and many others. Korr's Music can not be enveloped by one category. It is an extreme mixture of influences combined together to make a Death/Black Metal/Grind/Industrial/Melodic/Brutal blend of music. Korr's vocals can best be described as "the transfer of power" or a mixture of Death Metal lows with Black Metal highs and Goth tones. As far as live performance is concerned, Korr has frenzied the crowd and has had such an impact that one member of the audience actually set himself on fire in the pit!
