Inspired by the mystical forest of Sintra, Mors Liberatrix was a portuguese underground raw black metal band formed in 1995 by Gonius Rex (guitar & vocals), Guardi√£o (guitar) and Nazgul (drums). They released a MC demo entitled "Beholding from the Tower" through Nightmare Productions in 2003 containing the four following tracks: "The Flight", "Beholding From The Tower", "The Rising Of My Perpetual Gloom" and "Obscured". After that, Mors  Liberatrix went into deep sleep... probably eternal.
