Mount Kimbie are Dominic Maker and Kai Campos who met at university in 2008 and began making music together in a home studio in Peckham, England. 

The duo have developed a truly unique sound whose experimental rhythms lend themselves to the fringes of dubstep, wonky and hip hop, but ooze with emotion and echoing ambient soundscapes that take the listener to an entirely different place. 

Their EPs, released on Hotflush Recordings, have already been well received, with support from pioneering DJs including Mary Anne Hobbs, Scuba, Rob Booth and Ramadanman

Their debut album Crooks & Lovers was released on Hotflush in July 2010 and was met with critical acclaim. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mount+Kimbie">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
