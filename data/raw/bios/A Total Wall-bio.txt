A Total Wall was born in March 2009, when guitarist Umberto Chiroli and drummer Davide Bertolini decided to join forces and create a new project that could allow them to express their creativity free from restraints and nationality-dictated stylistic bonds. Emerging from a country where cheap pop music rules the scene, Umberto comes from several coverband experiences, with extensive live activity, mainly focused on classic heavy metal with a hint of prog; while Davide's background consists in a few bands that produced their own original material, prevalently in the rock/alternative field, with rare heavier inklings. Despite their previous activities, they both had much heavier tastes in listening, so it was about time they decided to bring that out and play the kind of stuff they liked. Umberto throws his progressive and technical influences in the mix, while Davide contributes a loud and articulated approach; the end result is a very heavy and aggressive math/groove metal.

After several attempts to complete the band's lineup, the two decided to focus on the new songs, while still looking for a vocalist (and actually auditioning a few). Since the introduction of 8-string guitars and of increasingly complex polyrhythmic structures, the sound of the band has become darker and heavier. Most of the songwriting happens in the studio, as a cooperative process between the musicians.
