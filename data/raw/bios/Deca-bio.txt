2) Deca makes use of an experimental style as a doorway to a stylistic everchanging evolution and not as a goal in itself. Great inventor of oneiric charms, he was at first inspired by the cosmic school and later he created his personal alchemy of tradition and innovation, blending natural and synthetic sounds. He has found inspiration in different musical genres but always remaining elusively versatile, so as not to be easily identified in one particular style.
He is an eclectic performer, his music ranges from pure electronic to a minimalist pianist-oriented style, but he doesn't like to follow trends, he rather changes continuously following his own path and tries to avoid the mainstream. A path which began in predictable ways (descriptive music, techno-pop) and then led him to compose the more complex and cryptic, obscure concept-albums he has since produced. Famous music critics and musicians appreciate some Deca's works as important chapters of electronic sound evolution, putting titles as "Simbionte" inside the gotha of contemporary avantgarde artists.
One of his recognized peculiarities is a great mastery of the sound: in his compositions he creates and works, almost with a manic care, on the tones and he often ends up with embryonic ideas for other future albums. He often has been defined as a sound alchemist.
He has been part of the international electronic and industrial scenes for twenty years now, but he has always preferred to make editorial choices without compromising his individuality in the slightest, with a limited production of records addressed to an audience of lovers and collectors and a distribution reduced to specialized routes. He has also contributed to other projects as well, involving himself in different artistic fields: for example in theatre, cinema, multimedia, even to ballet and giving shape to his personal research into the contamination of the genres.
He has an MA degree and one in geography, he studied classical piano for long years and has become quite versatile with the synthesizer in the studio as well as on stage. His career began back in the 80s, and while playing the piano on a mainly classical basis he made use of sequencers and electronic sounds. He then developed his first recordings in his first two official albums.
