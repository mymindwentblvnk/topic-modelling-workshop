Clearly the last place anyone would go looking for a gothic metal band, but if you leave this stone unturned, you’ll miss the lair of Tempting Tragedy.

 

Originally a side project for aspiring musician Marty Surette, who started recording songs as many do on a home PC, the band has evolved since its primitive inception in 2004 into a full powerhouse 5-piece unit in 2006.

 

As a full unit, Tempting Tragedy have played several shows locally over the past year, and have shown a care-free attitude while directly opposing current trends in metal, proving that a clean vocal aesthetic, synthesized sounds and a non-extreme approach can be just as metal as the opposing dark realms of black and death. Fast-forward to now, TT decided it was time to showcase their abilities with the release of their debut full-length album “Carpe Noctem”. The album is a rock-solid melancholic machine of death, pain and obsession, with an excess of influences ranging from classic to modern, from Maiden to Sentenced. However, by subconsciously channeling the likes of so many metal heroes of the past and present, TT have managed to create a sound that defies categorization and direct influential pinpoint.
