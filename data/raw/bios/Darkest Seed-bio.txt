In 2004, with the intention to produce expressive, technical and melodic music, and talking about deep and current themes, DARKEST SEED was born.

With Benhur Lima (bass and vocals), Ricardo Reolon (guitars) and CÃ©sar de Campos (drums), the group finished the track list of its first album, where songs as as "End of Time" and "Silent Scream" stand out, both of them with a very rock and modern rythm, with great melodic and harmonic sense, as well as strong choruses.

In this first record the band shows its musical maturity acquired from many years on the road, working with the most diverse musical styles, reflecting a sincere and honest music.

Now Darkest Seed is in studio working in its first full length. While the CD is not finished the band promotes a promotional EP which is available for download in their website, featuring a cover for Queen's "The Show Must Go On", and two new songs, "The Darkest Seed" and "Silent Scream". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Darkest+Seed">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
