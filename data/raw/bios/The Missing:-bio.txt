(1993-2010)

Gothic Industrial Metal band from New York.

The band has changed lineups over the years; DM (lead vocalist) is the only original member. The first version (in 1993) was a three-person group called "Three Teens Kill Four"; they didn't have a drummer and they were kind of Siouxsie-meets-Cure plus aggression kind of thing. They got a drummer in '94 and changed the name (on DM's suggestion) to "the missing:". At that time, her brother was serving in Desert Storm, and (although she took the idea from the Ministry song by the same name) the colon was added to symbolize a War List, as in, those "among the missing:" By 1996 the missing: had become an industrial band with all-new members, and by 2001 had morphed into an all-metal band, with completely different players. They finally met their most recent bass player in 2006.

DM also serves as a Paramedic with the 57th Battalion of FDNY, Bed-Stuy; Brooklyn, and also volunteers her time to the ASPCA.

The band gave it's final performance in November 2010
