Punishment Area featured a rough thrash sound, vaguely along the lines of Testament. Following the release of the album, Bob Perna was replaced by Merritt Gant, who later went on to Overkill. The band later broke up, then briefly reformed in 1994 as a cover band under the name of Wagonhead, though they never recorded.

In January 2003 the band united, the lineup featuring four of the Punishment Area members alongside original founding drummer Dan Hansen. A few shows were played in 2003, and the band is now considering working on a new album.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Faith+or+Fear">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
