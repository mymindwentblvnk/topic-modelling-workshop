DJ Marky is a pseudonym of Brazilian drum and bass innovator Marco Antônio Silva, who began in the early 90's (as DJ Marky Mark).

During the late 90's, he built up a following in London, then thought Europe and eventually took the world by storm. His live acts are known for precise / elaborate mixing and expectant crowds, with whom he evidently has a special connection.

His album début was "Workin' the Mix, in 1999, followed by "Audio Architecture" (2000, Trama). His third album, "Audio Architecture 2" was released in 2002. In 2004, DJ Marky & XRS collaboration resulted in the album "In Rotation", by Innerground.
