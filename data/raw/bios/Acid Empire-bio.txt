Acid Empire is a project founded by contemporary composer Mike Bridge. It is aimed as an expression of originality in song form, compositional style, instrumentation and lyrical content, trying to come up with something completely unique. The style includes sections of orchestral motifs, gripping dissonances and powerful resolutions. Underlying this is the compositional style of someone who is obviously influenced by the Metal genre.

The songs do away with traditional layout (i.e. verse chorus verse chorus) in favor of trying something new, there are still verse and chorus involved, but the somgs resemble something more like a peice of classical music where the main melodies progress into new melodies throuought.

The first Single release, 'Only The Weak/Denial' were two songs written for the upcoming album which is currently in the recording proccess. The next release planned is another single 'Would You Do It Again', which follows in the orchestral/metal style, due for release July of this year.
