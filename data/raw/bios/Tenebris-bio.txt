A message from
Tenebris

"To all our friends around the world!

We are the Polish band which music pulse has been transmited to all of you since 1991, expressing the aura of unscientific ideas such as Ufo, paleoastrology, prekognition and the paths which are strolled by the souls and ancient energies. It is the soundtrack for the wanderers of different worlds, who search the tunes influenced by KING CRIMSON, Elioth Goldenthal, Witold Lutoslawski, FREDRIC THORDENTAL, ISIS, Fields of the Nephilim, Tool, MORBID ANGEL and more...

Presently we are looking for a record company which would like to release our new album!
