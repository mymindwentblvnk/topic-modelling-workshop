STILLBIRTH is a brutal death metal band from Hagen (NRW), Germany.

Starting in 1999 with original members Lukas Swiaczny (Placenta Powerfist,  Xavleg (live), ex-Ingested (live)) and Phillipp Kurschus, Stillbirth saw a whole lot of different line ups till in mid 2008, the actual outfit was formed and the band was rebuild to kick some serious ass in the grindcore scene. Having shared the stage with acts like Jack Slater, Jungle Rot, Eternal Bleeding, Amagortis, Warmaster, Boiler, Infested, Hardflip and many more, Stillbirth proved their shows to be a blasting, in-your-face grinding experience. With a new record deal for 2009 and an upcoming, full-lenght EP, Stillbirth is heading straight forward to blast even more satisfied listeners away with their uniquemixture of grind, hardcore, death metal and brutal slamming beatdown moshpit madness.
