When Wallace Cochran was young, he couldn't stop talking about himself except to give misleading directions or have asthma attacks. When Jeff Stolz was young he hunted boar in Pretoria and watched, doe-eyed & silent, while his father used his skill as a jungle fighter to install de Klerk as State President. Together they have released three full length recordings with the Portland, Oregon based Marriage Records. They have toured the continental United States, trying to put right what once went wrong and, hopefully, find their way home. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Drakkar+Sauna">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
