Effectively merging the cultures of east and west, God of Shamisen (G.o.S.) is the world's first metal band relying on the three-stringed fretless lute of northern Japan. Led by Kevin Kmetz, the band involves elements spanning a multitude of genres, including progressive rock, metal, and funk. Following a 7" vinyl single, in 2008 their debut CD Dragon String Attack was released on Reptile Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/God+of+Shamisen">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
