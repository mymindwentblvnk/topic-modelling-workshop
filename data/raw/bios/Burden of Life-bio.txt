After a long time spent in their rehearsal room and the first few live appearances Burden Of Life first caught the public's attention with the release of their self-titled demo in 2007. More concerts followed and as the year 2008 progressed their first full-length “Ashes Of Existence” was recorded and subsequently released on November 14th accompanied by a concert. The album was well-received by the press and gave the band the opportunity to play more shows in the following two years.

Burden Of Life - Live at Helion Festival 2010 After a one-week-stint at Audiolodge Studios near Schweinfurt in spring 2010 the new EP “In The Wake Of My Demise” was released on September 10th the same year. The new songs were mastered by Stephan Fimmers (Necrophagist) at his Aexxys Art Studios. With the help of the EP, which contains four tracks, the band won the Metal Only Bandcontest in mid-2011. In spring 2012 the band recorded their second full-length “The Vanity Syndrome” in Rolf Munkes' Empire Studios in Bensheim which shows the band from their most varied side yet. For the release, which is planned for March 8th 2013 Burden Of Life were able to win over Firefield Records as a partner and the band is now ready to conquer the stages of the world.
