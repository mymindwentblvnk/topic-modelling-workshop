Bahamas is Canadian musician Afie Jurvanen (born April 28, 1981, in Toronto).

Jurvanen isn’t from the Bahamas; he’s a Finnish-Canadian raised in Barrie (a working class town in rural Ontario). Since 2009 he’s been making music under the name Bahamas--writing songs about sunsets, love affairs, and making out with crooked smiles. Through simple arrangements, he charts an escape route from the snow belt to the coral reefs. His album, Barchords, was released in 2012 to critical praise:

"Barchords is a gorgeous, full-bodied recording that revels in spare but intensely flavorful textures. It’s that delightfully rare kind of record that commands an instant replay."
- Los Angeles Times

“A reserved yet melodically rewarding exploration of relationships and heartache.”
– The New Yorker

"A sublime, incomparable leading man, one with a soulful, sweet and stylish touch in his song-writing."
- Globe and Mail

“Barchords is a work of impeccably concise and considered songcraft.”
