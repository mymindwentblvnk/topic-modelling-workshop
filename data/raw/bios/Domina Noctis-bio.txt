Since 2001 Domina Noctis published two demo cd ("Venus in a Dust Whirl", 2001; "Nevermore", 2003) gaining a good success with public and critics, before the excellently reviewed debut album "Nocturnalight" (2005), published by the italian label Officina Rock supported by Vampyria Gothic Caf√© and distributed by Masterpiece Distribution (Europe) and Century Media (USA and UK) and recently reprinted by the label Mystic Empire in Russia and ex-soviet countries.

Bringing a melodic metal with a modern and rock taste, Domina Noctis reached a good position in the metal scene thanks to the many live performances during these years, like the ITALIAN GOTHIC FEST (Milan, January the 19th 2006) with bands such as Macbeth, Lord Vampyrs Shadowsreign, Svenia, My Craving.   

Recently, Domina Noctis was voted as THIRD BEST NEW BAND 2005 by italian RockHard's readers.
