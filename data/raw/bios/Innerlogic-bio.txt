Innerlogic is a posthardcore band from Joure, Fryslan (The Netherlands). The band was founded in 1996, with core members Marty (guitar, vocals) and Eppie (drums) still in their teens. After some line-up switching guitarplayer Johan joined in 1999 and in 2000 bassplayer Robert was added. To this day the band still exists in this line-up.

The band is known for it's melodic sound with a west coast-punkrock-vibe, dropped D riffs, lush chords, a lot of post-hardcore underpinnings and songs well-crafted in a modern hardcore way with catchy vocal melodies and intertwining noise guitar textures.

Though the band rarely plays live (most of the time due to various injuries involving Eppie), they still write and record, with Marty and Johan running a small studio. Marty and Johan are also members of the well known indierock/postrock-band The Eve.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Innerlogic">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
