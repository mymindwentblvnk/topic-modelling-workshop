Kolp is a black metal act from Hungary. It was founded by Knot of Veér (formerly Ravenshades) and Witchcraft in 2007. Knot planned to create music without any compromise or restriction. In 2008 Jim Jones (also from Veér) was invited to make vocals and lyrics for the group. Their first material, The Covered Pure Permanence has been completed as a demo between 2008 and 2009 and it was released by Temple of Torturous as a full album in 2010. Currently they are working on their second release. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kolp">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
