Trapeze was a UK rock band formed in March 1969. The band had a fairly fluid line up, finally dissolving in 1991, and although they never found commercial success themselves, several members went on to join better known bands including Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Whitesnake, Judas Priest and Uriah Heep.

The core members of the band were Glenn Hughes, Mel Galley and Dave Holland. After Glenn Hughes' departure in 1973, Galley and Holland decided to try to keep the band together, which they did with constantly varying line-ups until 1979 when Holland went on to join Judas Priest. At this point the band broke up. Holland tried to revive the band in 1990, after leaving Priest, but the band finally broke up in 1994. Their first three albums remain their best known and most commercially successful. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Trapeze">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
