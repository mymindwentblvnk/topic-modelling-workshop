Elizabeth Mencel (born April 14, 1993), known professionally as Rozes, was born into a jazz-loving family, she grew up in the affluent Philadelphia suburb of Montgomeryville. Taking to music early, she began piano lessons at age six and eventually became a multi-instrumental prodigy also proficient on clarinet, saxophone, guitar, violin, flute, and trumpet, as well as an accomplished singer. The Pennsylvania pop singer/songwriter got her first big hit working with massive EDM stars the Chainsmokers before releasing her own debut EP. 

Mencel attended college in Philly for one year before dropping out to pursue music as a career. Her first recorded appearance, in 2014, was as featured vocalist on the song "Limelight" by young Australian EDM producer Just a Gent. The track was hugely popular, going on to rack up over 2.5 million listens on SoundCloud. Mencel was pleased by the reaction, but totally unprepared to find herself followed on Twitter by enormously successful New York EDM duo the Chainsmokers, who then contacted her to say they loved her voice and would be interested in collaborating with her. The result was "Roses," which she co-wrote and sang lead vocals on; the song went to number six on the U.S. Billboard charts, propelling her to fame at the tender age of 21.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rozes">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
