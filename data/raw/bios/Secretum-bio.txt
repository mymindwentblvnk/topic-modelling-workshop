"SECRETUM is one of the most promising Thrash Metal newcomers from Germany", proclaims German Metal magazine LEGACY in a review about the band's first album "HAPPY HAPPY KILLING TIME". Since the album's release in 2003 via the Slovak label METAL AGE PRODUCTIONS, the Berlin Thrash/Death band has drawn the attention of the worldwide metal press. After finishing this debut that had been recorded with the old line-up Kolja (vocals, bass), Jan (guitar) and Ives (drums), Spaniard Kato joined the band as the new shouter. Thus, SECRETUM strenghtened their live appearance and in early 2003 the band toured with the Sweden's DEFLESHED and the German act FEARER through Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands. The Spanish Metal Magazine HELL AWAITS reported exclusively about the tour and released one song on the magazine's Compilation CD. More releases on various international Metal samplers followed.
After the tour, SECRETUM had to handle line-up changes and the absence of band members in foreign countries. Nevertheless, the band continued playing shows and festivals with acts like EXODUS, PUNGENT STENCH, SUFFOCATION, DIE APOKALYPTISCHEN REITER, DEW SCENTED and GOREROTTED among others.
The current line-up in 2006 includes bassist Jockel (also member of NECROMORPH) and Thomas (ex-FROZEN FIELDS) on solo guitar. SECRETUM play powerful shows that attract both Hardcore and Metal fans. Currently the band is working on their forthcoming album and is planning to enter the studio early 2007.
Recently, SECRETUM were featured on the sampler "Berlin Extreme" including Berlin's top Metal acts with two title tracks. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Secretum">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
