Few artists have conquered the scene as quickly as Arman Cekin has. Hailing from the Netherlands, the avant-garde musician broke onto the dance music scene in late 2014, and hasn’t looked back since.  By 2015, Arman Cekin had reaped tens of millions of streams through a deluge of globally acclaimed remixes and originals, not to mention the high-end bootlegs of Rae Sremmurd’s ‘This Could Be Us’’ and Drake’s ‘Hotline Bling’.    

Diligent as ever, he never once slowed down the surge of scene-defining records, dropping 2016 single ‘Run’ onto award-winning record label Armada Music while pairing up with Veorra (‘You Don’t Know Me’) and Xuitcasecity (‘Show You Off’) for two riveting collaborations.   

In late 2016, Arman Cekin paired with Paul Rey to unleash the breathtaking ‘California Dreaming’. The straight-up summer jam was picked up by Warner Music Group and welcomed California native Snoop Dogg as a featuring artist. Within a year, the single went Platinum, and was followed by major collaborations with legendary Artists such as Waka Flocka. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Arman+Cekin">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
