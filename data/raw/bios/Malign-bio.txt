There are 3 bands with the name Malign. 
1) black metal band from Sweden, signed to Norma Evangelium Diaboli. Formed in 1994 by Mork, remained active until 2002. Then returned in 2011 and is currently active. Once a competent vocalist was secured in 1995, the band released two demos quickly followed by 1998's Fireborn 7" EP. 
After Fireborn, the bassist and guitarist left the band. 
With a smaller lineup, and the bassist from Ophthalamia, they recorded Divine Facing EP, released 2002 by N.E.D. on 10" vinyl. 

At this point the band was terminated as Mork was busy playing bass for Watain at live shows. 

2005 saw the release of a compilation CD Divine Facing + Fireborn containing the first two EPs as both were limited releases (there also exists a 12" LP version, released in 2011). This compilation is unlimited and remains in print.

When Malign returned in 2011, Mork and Nord, bandmembers since 1995 recruited two young members from the group Mephorash to play drums and guitar respectively. With this new lineup, they recorded the EP A Sun To Scorch which was released november 11, 2015 by N.E.D. on 10" vinyl.

2) A defunct Goth/Darkwave music project based out of San Francisco Ca. that was active in the mid-90's. Xavier Haight was the core of the project. His sole album Shatter and Impale was a mixture of baroque arrangements, industrial beats, and gothic atmosphere.

All the songs on Shatter and Impale were composed by Haight, with assistance from William Faith (of Faith and The Muse and Brad Beaver, who provided some additional drum arrangements.
