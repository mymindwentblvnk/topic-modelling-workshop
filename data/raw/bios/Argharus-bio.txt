Argharus is Lithuanian black metal band. Its traces can be found in the summer of 2004. Argharus can be called a band that breaks the stereotypes, is not restricted with standard frames, and seriously considers its activity. All members of the band are united because of their common idea – they are constantly looking for their unique sound, new forms of expression in creation. The band has improvised a lot for the recent years till finally they have hunted out their own, specific but pleasing sound. Though according to the musicians, they are influenced by the grand, because while not knowing everything, it is impossible to seek for something new. Asked about their decision to start their performance activity, they state at once: “The creative process requires certain space, but born and matured creation requires another, much wider space. A concert is just a proper place for our songs…”

Argharus claim they play black metal with nihilism breathing mood, misanthropy, sometimes even anger / aggression forms. The band members are not aiming to alter anything in Black Metal music, but they admit they expect to bring novelty and integrity on the music scene.
