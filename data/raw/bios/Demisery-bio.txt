Demisery is a death metal band founded in 2011 by Keith Merrow (guitar, bass, drums) and Gord Olson (guitars, drums, vocals). Known for his online success as an independent solo guitarist, Keith announced early on that the project would be different than his former work, falling in the vein of traditional death metal, taking heavy influences from such bands as Death, Grave, Cannibal Corpse, Morbid Angel, Obituary, Malevolent Creation, Monstrosity, Dismember, Seance, and Behemoth. 

On August 23, 2011, Keith posted a video on his Youtube channel (http://www.youtube.com/user/diobolic5150) previewing short clips from each song on the upcoming album, recorded during the guitar tracking process, and on September 1, 2011, Keith released the first finished Demisery track, titled "The Enlightener" via his Youtube channel, along with an early rendering of the album artwork, though the album's title was unknown at this time. The next month, on October 14, Keith released a second Demisery track, titled "Thralldom" again via his Youtube page. This release was accompanied by a preview of the finished album artwork, as well as a title for the debut album; "Hive of Mutation". The 11 track, 45 minute record was released on November 14, 2011.
