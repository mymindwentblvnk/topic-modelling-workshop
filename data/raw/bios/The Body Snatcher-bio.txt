Solo project of Ardath Grey, vocalist&bassist of Avafrost. The Body Snatcher's basic idea was to create brutal, but yet atmospheric death metal only with bass guitars.

The first demo, Wolf Moon was released in 2005. It was a raw creation, with heavily distorted bass quitars, low vocals and clips from various horror movies.
The second release, Gostfire, came out 2006 and added a new element to the songs, keyboards. This demo was a huge leap to the band. The sound became much bigger and much more atmospheric.

There may be other projects with the same name, this is the description of the Finnish TBS. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Body+Snatcher">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
