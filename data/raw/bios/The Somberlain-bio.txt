The Somberlain was born in 1997, between mysticism and solitude of a dark winter, under the former name of DAB. They return again, after 10 years of silence, with renewed fury, passion and components to overthrow forever the human stupidity and his zeal to destroy everything around them, playing their pure and genuine old school satanic black metal. They keep away from any kind of dogmatism and used their own hate to create the songs wich was recorded on their first LP "Ancient Satanic Cult" self-released in october of 2010. This is an apocalyptic ceremony who reflects a broken society in decline that is slowly sinking into their own trash. A record to awake the chaos against their enemies, who will wake up Lucifer from his eternal slumber ... a record unearthed from the hell which only one purpose... Hate you. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Somberlain">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
