Devilution is a five piece industrial rock band with members from South-East Queensland. Forming initially as a studio project, the band is now at the forefront of the Brisbane live music scene. Described as the musical lovechild of Mötley Crüe and Rob Zombie, Devilution has people talking for all the right reasons.

Releasing their debut album “Welcome” independently on October 31st 2008, the band has since sold out of its initial run.

The band consists of; the soaring powerful vocals of Jesse Dracman and the shredding guitar work of Postmortem Matt, backed by the solid rhythm section of Asbestoss Vorhees and Dr. Spikenstein on bass and drums respectively. The Spanner rounds out the band as the newest addition.

Since its inception the band has successfully had their first single “Bitch City” feature on the soundtrack for two adult films in the US. The track also was predominately featured on Warriors Realm which aired prime time on Fox Sports. The title track “Welcome” has also been licensed to be used in advertising for the Scandinavian Moto Grand Prix. With a new album in the works, slated for an early 2010 release, Devilution is promising an evolution of sound!
