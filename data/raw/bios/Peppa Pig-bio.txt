The biggest revelation of the decade, Peppa Pig is the most successful, talented and skinniest artist of the century since the start of her singing career with her award-winning debut album "My First Album," which sold 66 million copies only in Vietnam (8.2 billion worldwide, making it the best selling album in history) and got a perfect 10.0 rate on Pitchfork. The 12-track diverse collection explores genres such as atmospheric death metal and memphis rap; it features collaborations with Australian rapper Iggy Azalea and American salsa singer Raini Rodriguez, and it was produced by Scottish musician SOPHIE. "My First Album" spanned the singles "Bing Bong Zoo", "Expert Daddy Pig" and "It's Peppa Pig," which all topped the Billboard Hot 100, alongside the 9 other songs on the album, making it the album with most #1 songs in history, surpassing Michael Jackson's "Thriller" and Katy Perry's "Teenage Dream". "My First Album" was also certified triple Diamond in the United States in less than an hour, making it the first album in history to do so.

Peppa also holds the record of the tallest singer, being 7'1''. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Peppa+Pig">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
