Originally formed November of 2000. Bored with the bland and oversaturated 90’s wave of street punk, The Abiotx sought to take a heavier approach to punk. In the same vein as the more hardcore second wave of punk rock that emerged from the UK in the early 80’s (English Dogs, Broken Bones). Later on growing weary of three chord progressions; defining their sound by incorporating influences of new wave of British heavy metal and classic thrash metal. Rivaled by many second rate street and crust bands, to still reign supreme and proving to be an unrelenting force in Phoenix . All in all making The Abiotx the most ass mutilating, and in your face punk band in the contemporary hardcore music scene. Also a proud participant of the revival of American thrash metal.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Abiotx">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
