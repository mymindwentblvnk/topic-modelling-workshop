Sepiroth is a oldschool/brutal deathmetal band from Sliedrecht, the Netherlands. Sepiroth was founded by Damien Kerpentier and Chris Both when they were only 14 years old, in 2003. Playing with various people and under different names, Sepiroth finally found a singer in the person of Ben de Graaff, who is also lead singer for doom band Night of suicide. In 2005, Julian Schaap joined Sepiroth on Guitar. In this set-up, without a bass player, Sepiroth played for five years all over the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany allongside very known and unknown metal bands. Near the end of 2010, Julian Schaap left the guitar and picked up the bass instead, leaving a position open for Niels Lanser to join Sepiroth on guitar. In 2014 Niels left the guitar and Vince den Breejen joined Sepiroth on guitar.

In 2004 Sepiroth released their first demo called 'Carnage of the Souls', which was sold out shortly. In 2007 they released an EP called Dying for Hatred as a preview to their full-length release Breaking the codes of silence, which was released in may 2011 on CrossFireCult Records. Since then, the band has done (besides dozens of performances in and around the Netherlands) a tour in Indonesia (together with Decapitated, Devour the Martyr and Siksakubur in September 2012. On the moment, the band is focusing on recording a new album, due to be released in the summer or fall of 2014 entitled 'UNinvolved'.
