It’s Aussie slang for that annoying guy that won’t shut up.
You call that guy a parrot.
We’re that guy’s boss…
King Parrot are a 5 piece thrash grind metal outfit, consisting of members that have punished the ears and minds of Australian metal heads for many years in bands like Blood Duster, Dreadnaught, Watchdog Discipline, Cockfight Shootout, Stiff Meat and Mustang.The songs are short and hard delivered with blistering intent. Uncompromising brutality.
They stop at nothing to deliver a kick in the face everytime.
After proving themselves around Melbourne as a devastatingly fierce live act. It’s time for Australia to experience what King Parrot is about.
Do yourself a favour…
