From the blackest soils of Finland spawns HOATH. As the band states: "HOATH is a manifestation of the occult sciences, teaching and ideologies, reflecting the deepest essence of Heretical Iron Will and Thelema. Although  the music created by this congregation is raw, powerful and filthy  HOATH do not preach about mutilating Jesus to pieces. The lyrics are all principles of their beliefs, exerpts of the esoteric wisdom they engulf."

Musically band moves close in the style of Chaotic legends like Blasphemy and Sarcofago with a similar sinister atmosphere as VON reached with their demos! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hoath">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
