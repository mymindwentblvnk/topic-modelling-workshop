Bretwaldas of Heathen Doom is a doom/stoner metal band from the United Kingdom. The band was formed in 2001 and was originally named Icelord. Its members are Dagfari Wartooth (Bass, vocals) and Sceot Acwealde (Drums, guitars, vocals).
Their first and only demo called The Sleeping Trees Have Eyes was released in 2002. In 2003 their first full-length titled Droner was released. In 2006 their second full-length entitled Battle Staffs In The Mushroom Woods was released.
In the summer of 2008 the third album was announced under the title of Looting the Barrows. However, upon release in 2010 the album was entitled Seven Bloodied Ramparts. The well-received Battle Staffs in the Mushroom Woods was also repressed, this year with different cover artwork.
Work on a new album was held up as bassist/vocalist Wartooth suffered an undisclosed "brush with the law", however work has now begun again. Once more the album looks set to be called Looting the Barrows. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bretwaldas+Of+Heathen+Doom">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
