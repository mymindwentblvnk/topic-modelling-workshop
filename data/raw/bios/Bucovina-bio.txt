Bucovina was born in 2000, with Crivat and former bass player Harbard as masterminds; soon the initial drummer was replaced by Mishu, who has eversince become a permanent member of the gang. After Harbard decided to quit playing, the band entered a dormant stage, possibly caused by Crivat and Mishu's new deathgrind project "Vena Cava". 

However, in 2005 Bucovina came back on stage and has gathered massive hails from fans of folk metal, viking, heathen metal and other metalheads ever since.
The bass duties were carried out by the Vena Cava bassman, the Brazillian guy Paolo Cito (now moved to Romania). Too bad, he also decided to immigrate and has moved to Sweden; anyway, the first Bucovina album was written, performed and recorded with Paolo and his history in Bucovina is openheartedly revered by the members. The actual bass player is Becks (Tudor being his real name) a fairly young and gifted instrumentalist.

They have released a debut album in 2006's late summer, "Ceasul Aducerii-aminte" (Hour of Reckoning), issued through a Romanian label called Lupii Daciei. So far, along with their older and better-known fellows from Negura Bunget, Bucovina is one of the very few metal bands to explore and make use of the traditional values of the ancient Dacian heritage and Romanian lore.

Their debut album was welcomed with much praise by the public and they are currently working on the second album, claimed to be more and better anchored in traditional folk sound and also have a stronger theoretical and music concept. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bucovina">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
