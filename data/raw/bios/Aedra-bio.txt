AEDRA's evocative metal which draws inspiration from both experimenting post-hardcore, deviant polymeters and crushing grooves is an experience in a league of its own. 

AEDRA has been playing together in constellation of Peter Drastrup (drums), Loke Ansbjerg (bass), and Morten Purup (guitars) since early 2004 and has besides their newest EP ‘No End / Open End’ released both ‘Somatopagnosia’ (2008) and the EP ‘Craft of Artistry’ (2006) with help from Kenn Haunstoft (Cargo etc.) and Anders Ruby (Late Fairytale Studio). 

With their 2008 EP 'Somatopagnosia' AEDRA expanded their colourful musical palette further with their longest and - perhaps - most demanding opus'es yet. The themes on ‘Somatopagnosia’ are heavily rooted in the inability to recognize own body parts, distinguish them from other people’s limbs, and the rising anxiety, desperation and guilt following this cut off. The EP was produced by Anders Ruby (Lis er Stille, FiveDollarKillbotWhore, Puppet Arms, Vola etc.) and the highly coherent artwork was painted by Anders Davidsen (Crocell etc.). 

AEDRA has played with contemporary musical acts such as: 
City Of Ships (US), Whelm (DK), Double Space (DK), Rising (DK), Ruun (DK), Plöw (DK), Dance With Dirt (DK).
Currently the band is rehearsing and jamming new material. Hopefully another EP is to be released sometime in the future.
