Los Angeles' chilled-out electro/R&B duo RKCB features Riley Knapp and Casey Barth. The pair met as students at USC and soon realized their music took priority over school. RKCB's debut EP Short Films, which featured the lead single "Ignite," arrived in 2015 and quickly found success on several streaming platforms. The following year, the duo collaborated with Demo Taped (who had previously remixed "Ignite") on "Open Arms" and worked with Opia on "Always." That December, they released their second EP, In Contrast; it spawned several singles, including 2016's "Elevate" and 2017's "Enough," "Bloom," and "Naive."  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/RKCB">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
