LukHash is a music composer based in Edinburgh, UK. He creates a fusion of 8-bit digital mayhem and '80s inspired synth music combined with modern sounds and cyberpunk aesthetics.

His approach to electronic music weaves the hallmark features of several genres together with a nostalgic return to the musical motifs of the '80s to create something entirely fresh.

An avid experimenter with hardware synthesizers, LukHash's unique twist on 8-bit sound arises from over a decade of experimentation with digital logic hardware, ranging from custom modified Commodore 64 systems to hacked Nintendo Gameboy consoles.

Darker, dystopian and pensive in feel, LukHash's striking sound captures a curious contrast between longing for a time since passed, and the tentative steps into a future unknown. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/LukHash">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
