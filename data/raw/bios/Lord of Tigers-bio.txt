"This a recent project of Ryan (Sommerset/Luger Boa) Milon (Sommerset/Cobra Khan) and Ant Davies, all recorded at Ryans house.

A 6 song EP is due shortly, which I imagine will be available free for download.

First gig is Saturday November 22nd 2008 at the Thirsty Dog (Auckland) with Numbers, Tourettes, Shitripper and Antagonist A.D." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lord+of+Tigers">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
