Necrovore were active before the modern definitions of Death and Black metal had become standard. They sometimes refer to their style of music as Black Metal. However, the sound of the music is very similar to bands like Obituary, Possessed and other first generation American Death Metal bands.

They have been both allied to and critics of Morbid Angel. Jon DePlachett asked Trey and David of Morbid Angel to join Necrovore just before Altars of Madness was recorded.

In 1988 the song Slaughtered Remains was featured on New Renaissance's compilation Satan's Revenge Part 2.

Necrovore have awoken after a many years of dormant darkness, and are recording an entire album of pre-existing 80s material, including the four songs from their only demo (which also includes the song Slaughtered Remains). They also plan to record an album of completely new material. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Necrovore">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
