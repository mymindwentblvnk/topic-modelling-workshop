Electronic music enthusiast hailing from Russia, who's been involved into array of musical genres for years. Originally involved with the domain of Trance music (from its mainstream branches to less-demanded and more obscure divisions), he has been throwing thematic compilations since 2005. Vastly influenced by various instrumental, meditative and new age music since childhood, a concealed temptation had been waiting within ever since, until finally has seen the light in 2008 with first ambient-orientated compilations, Celestial Replication and Nocturnal Solstice.

Hexfire: «If I was to bring across my main pretension to music in short and aphoristic form, it would sound like this: “Music must be deep.”»

Current direction: deep and psychedelic ambient, chillout, new age, various intrinsic variations of intelligent downtempo music. Occasional drops of authentic trance (goa, progressive trance, darkpsy and other non-superficial (commonly darker) genres) are possible as well.
