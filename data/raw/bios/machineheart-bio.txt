Indie pop band machineheart were formed in 2014 by guitarist Carman Kubanda, bassist Jake Randle, and drummer Harrison Allen -- a group of friends from Tacoma, Washington -- along with Stevie Scott, an Anglophile singer from Los Angeles. Popular covers of Katy Perry and the 1975 helped them gain blog exposure (they even contributed a song to MTV's Scream television series), but it was not until the shimmery single "Circles" was released that the band received more serious buzz, with placement on emerging artist lists on various digital streaming platforms. That song was featured on their debut EP, In Your Dreams (Columbia), which was released in 2015. ~ Neil Z. Yeung, Rovi <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/machineheart">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
