The foundations of the 'VUIST-horde' go back to may 2000 when it was founded by Rik (Dark Remains), Edo and Rob. With some gigs planned in the near future Erik (Demalion) teamed up with VUIST in april 2002. During the same year the 'Megaknuppelinferno'-promo's ( Live & Unlive) were recorded in order to capture and preserve the Thrash / Death-oriented creations. After a few gigs Ronald (Demalion/ex-Aces) was added to the live-line up, hereby making it possible for Rob to focus himself on the vocals.
September 2003 saw the release of VUIST's debutalbum MiStorMelancholy.

In january 2004 our search for a permanent bassplayer ended when Jeff (ex-Rouwen) joined VUIST.
In order to promote MiStorMelancholy, VUIST ended up in several venues and presented their Death Thrash Metal to the Dutch Metalheads with increasing power, especially after adding some new, more brutal, songs to their setlist.

Early 2005 Erik and Jeff decided to leave VUIST. Jeff was replaced by Ronald, but now as a permanent member. As a 4-piece they did several gigs. By September 2005 Rudy de Pont, axeman of Dutch Thrashers Batter, joined forces! With full strength VUIST will record a new album and play live whenever possible!
