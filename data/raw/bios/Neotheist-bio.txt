In the frostbitten winter of 2009, three young men were conspiring about the future. One was Christian, one was Atheist, and one was Wiccan. Suddenly, lightning struck down, and Neotheist was born. It was not long before the legendary Mike Pardee, grand conjuror of melodies, discovered their abomination. It also did not take long for them to stumble upon the greatest misanthrope the world has ever known, Chris Wyand. Through Mike’s musical talent and Chris’ artistic expertise, Neotheist became a band.
 
After that, Neotheist had many members come and go. After a year of shuffling members, Neotheist finally had a steady lineup. Only James Hallenbeck and Zachariah Marks remained of the original three, with James on Keyboards and Zach as vocalist. Joining them was Chris Wyand as the bassist, Mike Pardee as the guitarist, and later came Brady Mentz as the drummer, and Jarppi Mäson as the guitarist in Neotheist. On November 20th of 2010, Neotheist played its first show at the Montage Music Hall.
 
Zachariah Marks served Neotheist as vocalist for almost another full year until September of 2011, but he was unable to control himself as a werewolf and eventually had to step down. He has since been replaced with the handsome, intelligent Matt Greenwood, member of Nokturnal Hellstorm. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Neotheist">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
