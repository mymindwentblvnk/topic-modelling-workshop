Campdogzz was at one point the duo of Jess Price and Mike Russell (the latter of whom was also in Maps & Atlases/Joan of Arc offshoot Wedding Dress and Suns), and they since expanded into a five-piece, including Mike Russellâ€™s former Suns bandmate Nick Enderle, Matt Evert, and Andrew Rolfsen. Their first album with this lineup (and second overall, following their 2016 debut Riders in the Hills of Dying Heaven) is called In Rounds, out now on 15 Passenger Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/campdogzz">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
