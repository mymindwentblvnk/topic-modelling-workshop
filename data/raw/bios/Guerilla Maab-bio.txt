Guerilla Maab was a Houston based rap trio which consisted of rappers Z-Ro, his cousin Trae, and his brother Dougie D. They have released 3 studio albums Rise (1999),Resurrection (2002), & Year of the Underdawgs (2003)(all of which have been released as a Screwed and Chopped version). The group disbanded due to internal conflicts regarding financial issues and solo careers. Their style is often compared to that of Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, mixing soulful singing with hard core street oriented lyrics. Guerilla Maab was and still is one of the hardest groups ever to come out of Houston.
