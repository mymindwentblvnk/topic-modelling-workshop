FLitCH is an instrumental rock band/project from the SF bay area CA, founded and maintained by Brad Rogers. He has composed all songs and played all the guitars, bass, keys, and synths. For the studio recordings, some additional musicians joined the project. All of the drum tracks and the engineering were done by Chris Mayrena at his studio in San Francisco CA. 

Studio guys :

Chris Mayrena - played drums on all tracks and is the current project engineer.

Tobias Hawkins III - percussion on "Bridging The Gap"

Patrick Cress - played baritone saxophone on "The Embracement Of Bi Polar Tendencies"

Patrick Wehren - played an ancient "wall art" piano on "Finally I Found It"

FLitCH is currently a recording project, and there are more songs on the way...

* "Bridging The Gap" contains a sample of Ted Glick (National coordinator for the U.S. Climate Emergency Council) speaking out and supplying hard evidence at a conference by the Climate Crisis Coalition, of which he is part of the The CCC Steering Committee, about The Bush Administration's disregard for and suppression of, very serious scientific fact and evidence that directly effects everyone on the planet and the planet itself. The permission to use this sample (at the end of that song) was given by Mr. Ted Glick himself and he encouraged the wide distribution of the song. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Flitch">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
