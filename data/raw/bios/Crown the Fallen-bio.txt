The story of Crown the Fallen began in summer 2015, where four musicians (Markus Pirker vocals, Michael Riedel guitars, Christof Guttmann keyboard orchesterarragements, Thomas Iberer bass guitar) drawn together by there love and passion for heavy, but still melodic music, wanted to create a new band. The successor of the former project (called "Python Regius") is the natural next step, the music they created needs. The combination of several musical influences as death-, black-, thrash-, prog-, heavy metal and classical music makes it difficult to classify CTF's genre. But indeed it's metal and that's for sure.
After a few weeks the band found in David "Dave Slut" Trummer the appropriate drummer for their future goals. Shortly after his recruitment CTF played their first show as a support-act of Deadlock in Graz.
In winter 2015 CTF entered the studio of Norbert Leitner (KRIMH, DEVASTATING ENEMY, ...) to record their first album "The Passing of Greed". This album features David KÃ¶nig on rhythm guitars.
"The Passing of Greed" broach the issue of individual social problems and difficulties arising from a misleading economic and political leadership. Design and cover artwork for this album was created by Christof Guttmann. The self-financed album is going to be released in winter 2016. The first track "Sic Semper Tyrannis" was released via YouTube, to introduce the forthcoming album.
In summer 2016 Marco Auer joined CTF as the new rhythm guitarist on stage and for upcoming studio sessions as well. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Crown+the+Fallen">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
