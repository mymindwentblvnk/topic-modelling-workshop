Deadwater formed in 2002 with nothing but beer, bbq, and heavy metal groove in mind. The original stage line-up was refferred to as a "local metal supergroup" as it consisted of five southern Illinoisians: Ryan Lewis of Pound-Five, Troy Bandy of Cataclysm, Jared Roberts of Jolly Roger, and Kevin Kepple and Chris Ballard of Zaius. Once launched, the band was quickly hailed as one of the premier heavy bands of the southern Illinois area as they were welcomed into the Southern Illinois Metal Collective (SIMC.tk) almost upon the band's inception.

The road to the present has seen injuries, a brown recluse attack, and lengthy Pound-Five and Zaius stints causing significant breaks in the band's schedules in the past, but all in all, much soul has shown through. Now, Deadwater is the focus for Ryan, Rod, T-Roy, and Chilo.

Their sound, to this point, has evolved from Pantera-esque heavy metal to the southern flavored, heavy groove they enjoy today. Their first EP release, "Brother John", showcases the band's past 3+ years with 6 songs written by all 5 original stage members, and 1 new jam. "BROTHER JOHN" IS NOW AVAILABLE. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Deadwater">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
