Len is an alternative rock group which formed in Toronto, Ontario in 1991 by siblings Marc "The Burger Pimp" Costanzo (vocals, guitar) and Sharon Costanzo (vocals, bass). As a duo they recorded two albums. They eventually brought in 3 additional members, D Rock, DJ Moves and Planet Pea. The expansion changed the sound of their music from punk music/pop music to a more hip-hop sound. They released You Can't Stop the Bum Rush in 1999, featuring the hit song "Steal My Sunshine", which was part of the Go soundtrack. The track featured a raspy sounding Marc complemented by the sweet sounding voice of Sharon, backed by a catchy beat (from "More, More, More" by Andrea True Connection).
