DOMINANZ – is a modern and hellishly powerful band hailing from Norway, a land with tradition in extremity in it's music styles. Therefor this band could be no exception, only they have enriched their sound even more. Basically the band members come from the Black Metal scene, and this is obvious in the way of singing, but also in the style of music. But, adding some atmospheric and Gothic stuff, along with various industrial elements here and there, they created an album that moves in more than just a dimension. The music is aggressive and groovy, and creates a very sick atmosphere that fans will love.

The orchestra DOMINANZ is a successor of the project called Cult of Deception that was established in 2006 by Roy Nordaas ex Taake and Ofryskje. After a couple of years with composing Roy joined forces with Frode Gaustad former drummer in the black metal band Thy Grief, and Jørn Tunsberg guitar player in the epic black metal band Hades Almighty, and formerly in the bands Immortal and Old Funeral. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dominanz">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
