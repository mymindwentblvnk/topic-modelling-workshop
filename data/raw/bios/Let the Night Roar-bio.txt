Let The Night Roar (formerly Tualatin) lies somewhere between the doom of Internal Void/High on Fire and the elder metallic crunch of Celtic Frost/Venom. The Atlanta power trio contains ex-Malevolent Creation guitarist Jeff Juszkiewicz. OFuzz-tones and sonic amplification backed by solid drum smashing, and vocally somewhere between Kurt from D.R.I. and Matt Pike. Let The Night Roar cranks up a sonically perfect first release recorded by Jeff Bako, which fans of the aforementioned bands will worship with mind-numbing glee.
