With irrepressible spirit and a devotion to celebration, Australian quartet Confidence Man specializes in campy, addictive dance anthems indebted to forebears like Deee-Lite and Tom Tom Club, as well as early-2000s alt-disco acts like Scissor Sisters, Fischerspooner, and CSS. Hailing from Melbourne, the Brisbane-based group was formed by members of indie/psych-rock bands the Belligerents, Moses Gunn Collective, and Jungle Giants. Janet Planet and Sugar Bones handle the vocals, while the mysterious Reggie Goodchild (synths) and Clarence McGuffie (percussion) remain in the shadows, under veils that protect their identities. With a wink and a strut, Confidence Man made their debut in 2016 with the single "Boyfriend (Repeat)," which they modeled after Brigitte Bardot's "Contact." After signing with Heavenly Recordings in 2017, they issued additional singles "Bubblegum" and "Better Sit Down Boy," which all appeared on their 2018 debut full-length Confident Music for Confident People (Heavenly/PIAS). Influenced by Talking Heads, Fatboy Slim, Groove Armada, and LCD Soundsystem, the set also included "Don't You Know I'm in a Band." ~ Neil Z.
