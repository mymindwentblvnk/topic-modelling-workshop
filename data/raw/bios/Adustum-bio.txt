BIOGRAPHY
Adustum is an isolated entity that reinstates the long lost veritable values and traditions of Adversarialism. Embrace this audible Grimoire as the vessel of the scorning and vicious self-initiation Rites of a Drakonian Magickian.Get Drowned in the Qliphothic corridors of Aindrogynous Sophia.Submerge the self in Adversarial Black Metal.
