WHISPER-X was born beginning of 2003. The group as it is known today stabilized in 2007 with Cedric on drums, Thomas on vocals, Vincent and Fred on guitars
and Férid on bass.

After a few years of existence and many demo recordings, the group decided to record its first album under the supervision of Mickael Valesi (furia) at the SONOVORE studio in 2006. Mastering was handled by Jean Pierre Bouquet at the “L’autre Studio”.

These four years helped them to build a solid reputation on the Lyon scene. (CCO, the Transbordeur, Lyon’s Hall…), but also in other regions and towns in France. (Le Tigre in Reims, the HALL C in Saint Etienne,
Les Tanneries in Dijon, The METRO in Thiers…).

Through perseverance and hard work, they shared the stage with some of the biggeST names of the French Metal scene such as GOJIRA, DAGOBA, WATCHA and No RETURN, as well as foreign groups such as DECAPITATED or GOREROTTED.

WHISPER-X has now taken on a manager, a web designer/graphical arts designer, as well as a Sound and Lighting engineer all intent on supporting them and helping them progress further. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Whisper-X">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
