Bio:
In the summer of 2005, after their previous band had parted ways Mark Green (drums) and Jake Ianacco (guitars/vocals) decided to continue to work together and look for like-minded musicians to begin a new project.  After receiving his number from a mutual friend, Jake invited guitarist Matt Fee to tryout.  Mark and Jake were impressed by his technical ability on the instrument as well as his capabilities to learn and retain material quickly.  After showing great potential, they invited Matt to join the fold.  
In the following months, they threw themselves into writing songs which display a wide spectrum of their shared influences and talents.  These songs run the gamut from the psychedelic rock of “Extrovert” to the technical brutality of “Induced Psychosis”.  Their creativity flourished while they continued to focus on finding someone to fill the bass position. 
 Eventually, Amorphic Form was able to contact Eric Doroshenko, who handled bass and vocal duties in Mark and Jake’s previous band.  Eric came down and impressed the trio with his vast array of bass techniques and stellar vocal abilities, and soon after, became the final member of the musical machine that is Amorphic Form.
Amorphic Form has fine-tuned their 8 songs of technical, mind-expanding music by playing numerous shows with well-known groups like Mortal Decay (Unique Leader) and The Adept (Siege of Amida), as well as legions of local bands.  In January, Amorphic Form will enter the studio and immortalize these compositions for the entire world to hear and appreciate.
