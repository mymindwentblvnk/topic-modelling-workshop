An interesting mix of progressive metal, melodic death metal, and metalcore. 

-----------------------

"A unique mix of heavy and melodic metal with prehistoric power. AJ Kolar and Mark Iannelli, Changing the world one song at a time.

Mark Iannelli and AJ Kolar in past lives were forged in the depths of an active volcano 6,000 years ago. They triumphed over all animals and women. They slayed demonic monsters until they rose to the top of the food chain and delcared themselves, Pterodactyl King. They have rejoined forces in present day and created a fusion of metal and melodic rock that will rule supreme.

Two men, Two minds, Two voices, One dream. Together, there's nothing they can't do. Dominating the masses of ear pussies waiting for a fat load. The weight and girth of their music will change the world forever. You can hear them featured on Protest the Hero's new album "Volition"! They did guest vocals on the track "A Life Embossed". AJ is featured at 1:02 and Mark is doing harmonies at 3:04 and the solo line at 3:18. "
