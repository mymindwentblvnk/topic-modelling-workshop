Blood Redemption started out in 2005. SPIRIT OF YOUTH and SOLID were dead, but some of the core members still felt the urge to keep on playing kick-ass music and spreading the message. Loaded with 15 years of hardcore dedication and a whole bag of experience through previous bands, the band soon appeared to be a steady, bullet-proof metalcore act. BLOOD REDEMPTIONs well-balanced line-up consists of the following dedicated people: Wim Jacobs on vocals (ex-LEGION, currently also in CRIMSON FALLS), Dominiek and Frederik Denolf on lead guitar and drums (ex-SPIRIT OF YOUTH, SOLID), Sim Meerseman on bass (ex-KINGPIN/TRENCHFOOT/SPIRIT OF YOUTH) and youngster Steven Bortier rhythm guitars.

With their roots in the H8000 hardcore scene, BLOOD REDEMPTION take the melodic, groovy, hard hitting metalcore the members former bands were known for, to the next level. Creating and searching for new and original music is the bands main goal. Being influenced (in the 90s by the great straight-edge/hardcore revolution with bands like YOUTH OF TODAY, JUDGE, GORILLA BISCUITS () to CRO-MAGS, PRONG, NEUROSIS (), but also being blown away by metal bands such as MACHINE HEAD, IN FLAMES, CARCASS () the end result is a great mixture of all of those influences. But also H8000 heroes such as CONGRESS, BLINDFOLD, LIAR, SHORTSIGHT with their commitment and energy, morals and ideas and obviously their great music surely played an important role in BLOOD REDEMPTIONs development. Lyrics deal with themes like societys fucked up class system, man thinking he can stand above nature and the result of that, animal rights, all political and religious incorrectness, and basically everything that goes wrong on this planet we call home. Taking it very personal and never giving up the fight or avoiding the confrontation. This being a very big part of their reason for existence in the hardcore! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Blood+Redemption">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
