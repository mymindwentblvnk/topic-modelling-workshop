Shadowflag is a hard rock power trio made up of Ben Jackson, Matt Olin, and Jason Maner based out of Charlotte, North Carolina. They formed in 2004 following Ben and Matt's performance as backing band in a local production of "Hedwig and the Angry Inch." In late 2005, the band placed 2nd in a nationwide competition sponsored by Zippo. The winner was given an opportunity to tour with the All-American Rejects. Shadowflag came in second after over 10,000 votes and several rounds of eliminations. The band is currently putting the finishing touches on their new album. 

In March 2006, Shadowflag released a full-length album, "Cause for Alarm." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Shadowflag">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
