KAMINSKY a.k.a. Alberts Kaminskis comes from Riga, Latvia. He is emulator, doing many things like being producer, artist-illustrator and DJ. Multi-angled, multi-genred, multi-diverse. Taking a look and listen on his stuff, first of all comes thrill over the body. Ideal ability and apprehension to catch the essence and taste of every music epoch, blanching it’s features out for more. Both by genres and individually given out, KAMINSKY’s contribution towers above imagination. There’s not actually so much pop-like remixes as we have heard from Star Slinger, Penguin Prison and others. In-between of pop-sick remixes, KAMINSKY offers stainless ambient, lil dabstep and hiphop, refreshing electronic, club-dance strived remixes.
