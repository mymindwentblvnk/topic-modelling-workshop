Luscious Jackson is an American alternative rock group formed in 1991 in New York City, New York. Named after former Philadelphia 76ers pro basketball player Lucious Brown "Luke" Jackson, the band released three full-length albums between 1993 and 2000, when they split. In 2011 the band re-united.

The original band consisted of Jill Cunniff (vocals, bass), Gabby Glaser (vocals, guitar), Kate Schellenbach (drums) and Vivian Trimble (keyboards, vocals).  Schellenbach was a founding member of the Beastie Boys and left shortly after the Beasties switched from being a hardcore punk band into being a hip-hop group

Between 1993 and 2000 they released one EP, three full length LPs and ten singles on the Beastie Boys' Grand Royal label. Their biggest hit —and only Billboard Top 40 entry— is "Naked Eye" (#36, March 22, 1997). Other notable singles include "Here", "CitySong (NY State Of The World)", "Under Your Skin" and "Ladyfingers".

Vivian Trimble left the group in 1998, and in 2000 (after releasing one album as a trio) the group officially announced the break up of Luscious Jackson.

February 2007 saw the release of Luscious Jackson's "greatest hits" compilation, and in the fall of 2006 the band announced that they had reunited and were to release a new children's album, a plan which never came to fruition and the band ceased activity in 2007.

In the January 2012 issue of "Rolling Stone" magazine, the band announced that they had reunited in late  2011. Subsequently, the band has released Magic Hour (2013) and Baby DJ (2013).  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Luscious+Jackson">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
