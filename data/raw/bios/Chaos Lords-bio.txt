"90's Gothic Thrash": Stomping & Ripping Metal Sarcasm & Noodling, melodic, noisy, & abrasive w/ just a tiny touch of the early Death Metal influence...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  
Chaos Lords hungry, Ferocious baby demons with sharp teeth and sharper vocabulary... Pissed-Off Kids ready to invade Minneapolis with their homegrown metal goop! We were completely unable to identify with the cheesy drama & posing of the late 80's/early 90's hair bands... and at the same time most of us just weren't quite "down with" the understated, nonchalant, seemingly apathetic GRUNGE-THING. Our band, Chaos Lords, was born out of that 'confusion'... And out of having grown up playing Dungeons & Dragons, of course! This all started as one group of friends unwilling to play bad 80's covers in the 90's.

Artist History:
In the streets of conservative St. Cloud, MN, it was next to impossible for a young metal band to gain recognition without falling slave to the tyrannical brainwashing of commercial radio. But since it's conception, CHAOS LORDS have refused to bow down to the club owners who will only book cover bands. Reached it's peak in the mid-nineties with radio play on 101.7 WHMH FM and a CD titled 'devour' that was available at all midwest Best Buy stores.
