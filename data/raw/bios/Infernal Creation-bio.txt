Formed in 2009 Infernal Creation have unleashed their venom across various venues and festivals in the UK.

2011 saw the release of the bands first full length CD "The Serpent Seed Doctrine" which was received well by the UK underground being described as "First class black/death metal, full of hate, melody and evil" by United Kingdom Extreme Metal. After its release the band appeared on the Zero Tolerance sponsored 'Warhorns' tour.

Infernal Creation have shared the stage with bands such as Hecate Enthroned, Fleshgod Apocalypse, Nothgard, The Prophecy and many more.

The band constantly strive to push their music further, blending various forms of Black and Extreme Metal into an entity of nihilistic intensity.

2012 is definetley the year of the beast! Playing the new blood stage at Bloodstock Open Air Festival, big things are set to come from this rising force in the UK underground! With a follow up to "The Serpent Seed Doctrine" in the pipeline, aswell as guest vocals for Ballberith and afew more tasty surprises on the way. 2012 is lining up to become a very exciting year for this band. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Infernal+Creation">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
