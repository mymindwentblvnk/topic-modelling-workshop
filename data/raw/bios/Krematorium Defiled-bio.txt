A new revolution in heavy metal. 
Krematorium Defiled have begun the new wave of Australian Melodic Thrash Metal. 

Containing four young metallers from Melbourne, Victoria (Shane, Dale, Joel & Brendo), these boys have released their Self-Titled demo. 
Entering the local metal scene in early 2010, Krematorium Defiled came together from several different projects (Acolite, Demon Halo, These Haunted Shores). Unable to find either sufficient time, skilled players, or even similar musical tastes, these four young men came together to create the band you see before you. 

Inspired by many different metal styles (Black, Thrash, Death, etc...), Krematorium Defiled have developed their own sound. With Melodic Death metal riffs, black metal inspired lyrical content and experimental vocals, there is no other band with their sound. 
Each member equally shares in the writing process, personally developing not only their part, but influencing each other's through their vision. Each member has different musical influences, and their unique writing style allows each player to combine their style and ability with that of the rest of the band. 

Krematorium Defiled have released their self-titled 2010 demo, containing the 2 songs featured on their profile. The demo has been given to members of the public for free, and has recieved fantastic reviews. 
The band have already begun work on their follow up E.P. coming up in the next few months. This E.P will feature re-done versions of the demo setlist, plus 4 extra original tracks. These two releases will ramp up the 2011 release of their debut album (which is, at the moment, a goal they have set). 

The band are, at the moment, VERY busy. They are currently in the writing process of new songs, attempting to get airplay on the local radio, finding gigs to play and promoting the Demos release. 

Brendo has recently focused soley on vocals and thus Krematorium Defiled have introduced a new guitarist. The line up is as follows.

-Brendo: Vocals
-Hayden: Guitar
-Dale: Guitar
-Joel: Bass/Vocals
-Shane: Drums
