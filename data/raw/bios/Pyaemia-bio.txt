Brutal technical death metal band from Netherlands.

Pyaemia is a form of septicaemia that leads to widespread abscesses.

Due to the aggrivation of an old wrist-injury suffered by Robbert Vrijenhoek, Pyaemia (and his other band Disavowed) had to be put temporarily on hold. New material was originally planned for some time in the future, but after more than a year on hold the band called it quits on 22/12/05. The band then formed as Arsebreed.

Pyaemia have not reformed, contrary to the repeated rumours that seem to do the rounds on a semi-regular basis.

Joel Sta was a member of Nocturnal Silence, who later became Disavowed (after he left), and appeared on that band's 'Plateau' demo. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pyaemia">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
