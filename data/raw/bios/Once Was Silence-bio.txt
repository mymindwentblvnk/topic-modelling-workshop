Once Was Silence born in 2002 from an idea by Dario (guitar), Fabio (bass) and Sabrina (vocals). To the band joined Luca (drums) and Federico (vocals). Firstly the band tried to look for a keyboard player but luckily no one arrived so Riccardo joined as a second guitar.

The very first mood of the songs was very cold and gothic, but this way to play changed just after few compositions. The band decided to explore new ways of expression and try something more complicated, to abandon the gothic component and make room for a mix of many other musical styles.

In june 2004 after some concerts, OWS recorded, in just three days, their first demo called I.D.D.Q.D. It was an expression of the first gothic period with something of the change that was in the air. With the next songs the band started to realize their own style and to create a more band oriented way to compose: instead of being only Dario the composer, now every member of Once Was Silence propose new songs, riffs or modification on already written parts.

In the spring of 2006 Fabio decided to leave the band and he's been replaced with Piero, already at work with Dario and Sabrina in another band called Lovelorn.

After some gigs and a some days playing new stuff, in fall 2006 Once Was Silence record their second demo, Orphan Warped Sun, a little bit more death metal oriented than the first.

To create a more tribal sound, by the end of the first half of 2007, Francesco enters in OWS playing percussions. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Once+Was+Silence">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
