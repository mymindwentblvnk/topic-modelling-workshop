Dark Tribe was formed in 1997. The music is cold, raw and partly psychotic black metal, mixing clean vocals with raw screams together forming a sound described as total insanity, while their lyrical themes mostly revolve around hate and psychology. They have produced three full-length albums so far and are currently working on their fourth album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dark+Tribe">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
