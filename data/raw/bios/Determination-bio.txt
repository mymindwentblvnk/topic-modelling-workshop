Biography:
Determination was founded in 2004 by it's 3 original members Jon, Jonny & M'rtl. They started writing songs in the style of Grunge and played their first gig in june 2005, at a youth event called "@mos4". In the summer, fall, winter of 2005 and spring of 2006 they played more than 10 gigs and became locally known. Due to local success Determination also started playing some shows all over southern Germany. The highlights included such events like Teenstreet 2006, where they played for a crowd of 4000 people, and the Himmelfahrtsfestival 2007. Determination recorded their first self-titled demo in the winter of 2004. After the local success of the first demo they released the "Days and Nights" Live CD in 2006, which included live recordings of the most famous songs, taking the listener to a direction of some kind of Nu-Metal. After writing and arranging new material for a complete album they took their music to their home studio in order to record their latest full-length Album "Token", which was released in July 2007. With the Violet EP they made a voyage into a metalcore direction. The EP was released on their "Determination says goodbye" show on 5th June 2009, splitting up on that date due to individual personal careers.
