Serbian NS folk/black metal band. Inspired by bands like Nokturnal Mortum, Ashen Light and Graveland and Slavic heathen beliefs, Vandalicum came to idea to form a band that will play heathen folk metal, strongly influenced by black metal sound and atmosphere. The band was formed in 2006 with keyboard player Nocturno, and named Hesperus. Independor joined soon.
In 2007 band changed the name into Kagan and line up was changed also, only Vandalicum and Independor stayed. After first recordings, band collected all of recorded songs into, so to call, compilation, Slovensko bojiste, which was officialy distributed by Frostscald records, on MC format.
In the end of 2007/beginning of 2008 band recorded Price sa Alatira, first full-length album (released by Pannonian Winds Production in 2008 on MC format), and songs for split with Drakonian age, Sonn av Skogen and Wolforder (soon to be released by Satanhades) on which we had female vocalist Jelena.
In the spring of 2008, band recorded promo “Sign from the sky”, which had a good critics among the listeners, as this is for the first time we got the sound we wanted.
Band continues with composing new songs, and preparing new album called: ”Monuments of Heathen Sorrow”.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kagan">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
