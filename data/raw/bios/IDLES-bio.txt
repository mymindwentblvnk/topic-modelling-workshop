Idles are a heavy post-hardcore/punk band from Bristol, London and Newport. The success of the band’s debut EP “Welcome” did not go unnoticed and so it happened that BBC Introducing in the Southwest honoured the group as “Band of The Year” in 2012.

After a hiatus, the band returned in 2015 with “MEAT EP” and “META EP”. “Divide & Conquer” and “Well Done” were released in 2016, when it was announced their debut album “Brutalism” was released on March the 10th, 2017 and was supported by a 24 date UK Tour during March and April.
