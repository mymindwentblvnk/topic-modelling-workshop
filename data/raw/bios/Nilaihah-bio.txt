N I L A I H A H was founded by Stefan, Joern and Kay in late 2003.
After a few month Jonathan joined and Kay left the band.
In August 2005 they recorded their first 6 track CD called "Demo2005".
Since early 2006 we found a new Bass-guitar-player named Markus
who played his first Gig with us in April 2006 after 6month of not entering the stage.
