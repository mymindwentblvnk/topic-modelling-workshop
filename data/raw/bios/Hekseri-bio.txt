HEKSERI hail from Eastern Massachusetts, an enclave of traditional demonic evil. 
The band plays punishing and dynamic black thrash metal in the vein of 
IMMORTAL, BATHORY, KREATOR, ANGELCORPSE, and VENOM.

Hekseri (the Norwegian word for 'witchcraft') formed in the Spring of 2004 when guitarists
Larissa Glasser and Megan Leo decided to merge their 80's thrash influences and 
develop into a new force on the New England Metal Scene.

Luckily, the band secured the bass slot within a month, bringing Jason Cammarata 
into the fold. His stylistic prowess, identical influences, and accomplished musicianship 
greatly impressed the band, and auditions were posted to fill the formidable drum duties. 
Alas, no suitable candidate could be found that year.

Undaunted, the band recorded a 4-song demo 'Retaliator' using a drum machine, 
possessed vocals, and primal thrashing energy. The results exceeded the band's 
expectations, and the demo received an overwhelmingly positive response from the 
Metal Communities of MYSPACE and RETURNTOTHEPIT.COM. 
Offers came in from drummers who shared the band's black-thrash influences, 
and the buzz surrounding the young band began to pick up steam.

In May 2005, Hekseri made their official debut on the NEW ENGLAND IS WICKED PISSED
compilation, contributing a new song ‘Skull Rack.’ An abominable mix of DEICIDE and VON
influences, the song detailed the bloody sacrificial practices of the Aztec priests, 
and is arguably the sickest song HEKSERI has yet recorded.

Finally, in Spring of 2005, Seth Greenblatt began jamming with the band and 
decided to join full time. Since then, the band have assaulted audiences throughout New England, 
amidst a still growing resurgence of Black Thrash Metal bands.
