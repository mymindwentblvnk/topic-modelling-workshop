This is a very unknown, but original band from Warsaw, Poland. They play an epic mixture of funeral doom, sludge/doom and a hint of black/death/doom. The sound of the music is very shamanic, dark, loud and bonecrushingly heavy. The growls of the vocalist, Marcin Rusinowski, is very similar to those of Niclas Frohagen from Ningizzia and Forest of Shadows. In addition to the two aforementioned bands Ysigim can be compared to Skepticism and Enoch.

Members: Marcin Rusinowski (guitar, vocals), Marcin Kowalski (drums, 1992-98, 2005-present), Adam Hertel (guitar, 1993-97), Wojciech Kuśmierski (bass, 1993-97), Mariusz Rachuba (guitar, 1997-??), Cyprian Konador (bass, 1997), Kamila (vocals, 1997-99), Piotr Leniewicz (bass, 1997-99), Mariusz Wiśniewski (drums, 1998-99)
