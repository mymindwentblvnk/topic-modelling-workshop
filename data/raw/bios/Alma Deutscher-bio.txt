Alma Elizabeth Deutscher (born 2005) is an English composer, pianist and violinist.

From a 2020 review by Barton Swaim in the Wall Street Journal:  
"Her oeuvre is small, but it includes chamber and orchestral works of inventiveness, technical sophistication, wit and, above all, melodic richness. She has performed her piano concerto and violin concerto with orchestras in Europe and the U.S.; her opera, “Cinderella, ” was performed by California’s Opera San José in 2018 and released on DVD by Sony Classical. In November, Sony released “From My Book of Melodies,” a collection of solo piano works."

Recordings of her precocious compositions, performances and improvisations can be found on her YouTube channel, which was set up by her father Dr. Guy Deutscher (born 1969, Tel Aviv), who is an Israeli linguist and academic (Professor in the Department of Languages and Cultures of Ancient Mesopotamia at the University of Leiden).
