Fathoms Pass, once known as Retaliation, is a progressive metal band based out of Tampa, FL.
Heavily influenced by bands such as: Adagio, Scar Symmetry, Opeth, Between the Buried and Me, Septic Flesh and others, Fathoms Pass maintains a dark neoclassical feel, with heavy percussive rhythms and a mix between masterful clean vocals and harsh growls. This all is engulfed by a massive array of orchestral elements to fuse brutality with classicism. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fathoms+Pass">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
