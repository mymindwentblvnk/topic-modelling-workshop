(3) Monobrow was formed in Ottawa early 2009 when bassist Sam Beydoun and guitarist Paul Slater (formerly of Vancouver's Sir Hedgehog) first jammed with drummer Brian Ahopelto of Acres fame. Sharing a common love for adventurous, underground heavy rock in its many guises, the group quickly built up an impressive repertoire of original songs over the next few months. Monobrow's sound can be described as riff-based hard rock, with psychedelic flourishes, and a sense of jamming contained within strong songwriting. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/MONOBROW">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
