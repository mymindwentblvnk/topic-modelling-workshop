Bio:
Immortal Prophecy officially began in the summer of 2007 when guitarist Carlos Apodaca joined the trio consisting of guitarist Isaiah Santistevan, bassist Jason Orona, and drummer Justin Sanchez. The group added the vocal talent of Estevan Robles in fall of 2010 to complete their sound. The band's style is an aggressive new form of progressive deathcore with melodic and layered breakdowns, up beat riffs and plenty of blast beats. Since 2007, Immortal Prophecy has been bringing their high energy live show to many venues around Albuquerque, Santa Fe and other towns in New Mexico, as well as Phoenix, Arizona. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Immortal+Prophecy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
