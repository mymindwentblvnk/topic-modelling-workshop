TROGLODYTE DAWN was conceived in the summer of 1995 in Spokane, Washington as a one God/one man project by Randy Michaud (ex-D.T. SEIZURE, ex-ARISE and ex-TYKKUS). During the next seven years and after a move to Phoenix, Arizona, the inspiration for the music on the debut CD was written and recorded. The songs and instrumental pieces reflect the artist's interpretations of real events in his own life and in the lives of those around him set against the spiritual backdrop of his faith in the Living God. Since its completion early in 2003, the CD has been promoted and distributed solely by the artist's own hand, word of mouth and via the Internet. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Troglodyte+Dawn">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
