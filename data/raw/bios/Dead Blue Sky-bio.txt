Hailing from Dayton, Ohio and founded in 1999, Dead Blue Sky was often described as a melodic death or black metal band. However, their roots in music are much deeper. In context, the members emerged from a 90s hardcore scene and integrated melodies and metal sensibilities at a time when metalcore was at its infancy. Their lyrical content was based on sorrow, despair, and love. In 1999, the band signed to Goodlife Recordings (A Belgium label) and put out a single 7" called "Reduced to a Whisper" which contained 2 songs. After some lineup changes, the band recorded their only full length album to date, "Symptoms of an Unwanted Emotion". Recorded in 2001, the album was a departure musically from the original band and showed the tremendous growth and complexities. On March 23, 2002 the band went back into the studio and recorded a Live Album. Unfortunately, that 10” was never released. After, a European tour in the Summer of 2002, the band ultimately disbanded. Over the years, the members have gone on to play in other musical projects but nothing has ever captured the magic of what was Dead Blue Sky. Until now…
