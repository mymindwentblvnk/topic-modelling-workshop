Ordo Templi Orientis – belarusian band, created in 2004 by Gesmas Lvcen Waarg (aka Asmodey Nahema, also known by his Grieved Sometime Valley, Pant, Goat Occult Christgasm) in Grodno. First 4 years he worked alone, as a result – a lot of DEMOs of raw black metal. In 2008 Gabriel Van Abatth joined the project. At that time the first official release “Where Eternally Autumn Winds Blow” comes at Rigorism Production, genre: atmospheric / depressive black metal. After full-length album comes split CD-r with russian band Iad Uroboros at the same label - depressive black metal / post-rock, and EP CD-r “Eros et Culto Thanatos” released by belarusian label Omega Production, genre: raw depressive black metal. In 2009 it reissues on tape released by Heavy Penetration Production (Germany), and also split album released by SFH-Records… We consider our music eclectic black metal, what means we work in different sub-styles of black metal genre. There are more than 15 positions in our discography and it’s getting wider…
