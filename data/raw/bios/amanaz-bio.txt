Amanaz was formed in 1973 in Kitwe, Zambia. Their songs are in both English and their native language Bemba. Musically, they go in the same direction as Blo, The Witch and Question Mark, but stoned with amazing fuzz guitar all over which sounds like an African version of early Cream. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Amanaz">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
