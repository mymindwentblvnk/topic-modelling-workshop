Brooklyn-based Coasting have been diligently practicing in the basement.  The band consists of Madison (member of Dream Diary, vocals and guitar) and Fiona (New Zealand band Coolies, and current drummer for Vivian Girls).  Their music is an amalgam of thunderous drumming, surf-rock guitar lines, and lo-fi vocals.
