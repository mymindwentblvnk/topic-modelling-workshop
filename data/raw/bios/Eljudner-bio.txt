Eljudner was formed during the hot diabolical summer of 2003 by guitarist Rhafnhugr. Inspired by early 90's Norwegian Black Metal he wrote the tracks that soon were to be released as the 2003 promo. The line-up by that time was: Vanir on vocals, Rhafnhugr on guitars, Skogskjelv on bass and Arnis on drums. The promo gained good critics all over the world and the band planned to release a 7 “ on their own label. But shortly after, they got in contact with Northern Silence Productions and the 7” turned into an MCD instead. Unfortunately Arnis left the band before the recordings of the MCD were completed so the release had to be postponed several times. After a couple of months and with new man Sadist behind the drums the MCD could finally be recorded and released. Daudingekvider entered the shops in July 2005, and the critics was once again great. The band is now (feb 06) back in the studio, working on some new material for a future vinyl-only release. More info soon to come...
