Hello. Noise Machine are a bang volume of Dublin in Ireland. We were educated two thousands and two. Our first concert was in a Dublin publication, which was called ' "O'Neills" '. If you liked to arrive at this publication, it is near the "helmet", a popular Dublin land marking. The helmet has a diameter of 3m (10 ft) at the lower surface and narrowed to 15cm (6 inside) at the top side.
