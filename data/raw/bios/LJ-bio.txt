There are two artists by the name of LJ.

1) A Funky House Artist from the United Kingdom.

2) Deep, sultry, sexyâ€¦this is the sound of LJ. Originally from Cincinnati, LJ now makes his home in Omaha where he comprises one fourth of the dynamic production crew known as Organic Productions. Organic is responsible for sponsoring some of Omaha's hottest events with talent such as DJ Icey, Max Graham, and AFK. When LJ isn't promoting events or engineering light shows, he's probably manning the decks, spinning the deepest of the deep in house and progressive. This particular set entitled, "The Lost Juice", pays homage to the sound that LJ is known for. Back to his deep house and jazz roots, LJ lays down the deepness with just enough groove and funk to keep it interesting. This is a set not to be missed! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/LJ">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
