Truculency is a brutal death metal band from USA. They formed in 2007 by 'Serious' Steve (Guitars, Bass) and 'Sloppy' Joe (Drums, Vocals). The band plays very furious brutal death metal along the lines of Spawn of Possession, Despondency and bordering technicality of all technical brutal death metal artists.

They sent out some promos in early 2008 to labels and got picked up by the infamous Amputated Vein Records to distribute their debut album "Eviscerate the Paraplegic" on April 29th 2009. The album was recieved well from the community, even though not a groundbreaking entry, as a good solid technical but brutal achievement.
