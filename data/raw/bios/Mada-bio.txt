After recently stepping back from life on the road with her previous band and taking the leap into a solo career Mada is a woman whose bow is aplenty with strings. Singer, songwriter, unique performer, event organiser, front woman and with nearly a decade of experience behind her she is not at all fazed about going it alone. Before joining with her record label she also managed to record, shoot a video and release her first solo single ‘Roots’ onto iTunes with a DIY attitude and with an excitement and a longing to take her music to the next level and reach a wider audience that is a joy to see.

Next in the pipe line for this emerging talent is a new E.P. released later this year and an album in the not so distant future. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mada">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
