1) 
Bill Skins Fifth hails from Salo, Finland. Founded in early 2008 by Timo Heikkilä, Henrik Hömppi and Aamos Ylönen.
After spending the whole year 2008 writing songs and having their first 2-song demo done, they still hadn't found a bass player to fill the gap in band's line-up.

In 2009 Marko Krzywacki joined in as a session basist for a couple of shows, but the band wasn't able to find a permanent bass player until fall when Sami Kuusisto joined in.

In the end of 2009 Bill Skins Fifth hit the studio for a second time to record their upcoming debut EP Act One. It was released in the spring of 2010 and recieved a lot of good reception from media and fans.

In the fall of the same year Bill Skins Fifth joined Metallia Perkele Tour to tour with bands like Subscribe, Grendel and Kiana in Finland and other European countries.

In the beginning of 2011 BSF headed to the studio to record their second EP From What Lies Beneath.

2) B.S.F. was formed in 2001, but in the beginning we 
were limited by our capabilities, sources of good music. Couple of 
years later things changed. We matured musically and intellectually, so a 
new door was opened meaning that we felt the need to express our self in 
a less traditional hardcore sound. As for the name, BSF is a name taken 
from the movie "Silence of the Lambs" in which Bill takes off the skin 
of hypocrisy and show the ugly truth of the world to his kind. Buffalo 
Bill is the society we live in- the fifth victim is us, the people that 
have something to offer and are considered dead as said in the movie. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bill+Skins+Fifth">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
