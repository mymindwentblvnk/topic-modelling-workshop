STUDIO OST is the side project of @alvin-aronson and @galcher-lustwerk. Compiled from jam sessions recorded in various studios in New York between 2012 and 2015, Scenes is a 2x12" traversal of the pairâ€™s cinematic audioscape through breezy electro, aquatic dub, high speed jit, and shimmering atmospherics. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Studio+OST">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
