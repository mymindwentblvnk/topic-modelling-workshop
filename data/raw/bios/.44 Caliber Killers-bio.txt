"In the land of scissor kicks and floor punches comes an crossover thrash band that is more catchy than AIDs in Africa, has more hooks than a tackle box, and grooves like James Brown on cocaine. The band consists of two irritated Italian punks who are attentive to the state of today's testicle-choking girl pants, make-up encrusted scene and hope to demolish it and what it stands for. With some mic punches, thrash kicks, and circle pits the plan is to take it all down. 1/2 cup of booze, 3/4 cup punk, a hit of speed; thrash it all together, and you have .44 Caliber Killers.

Tearing shit up, and getting intoxicated in celebration of doing so is a must. Headlining or opening act, house or club, we'll play anything and everything that you throw at us. So, for booking just message us through here." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/.44+Caliber+Killers">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
