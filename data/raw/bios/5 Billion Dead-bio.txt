5 BILLION DEAD come to battle as THE NEW AMERICAN HEAVY METAL claiming dominion over the southeastern music scene.

Punishing rhythms, blistering musicianship, and dominating performances have thrust 5BD to the top of the mountain, setting the standard by taking over each city one by one. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/5+Billion+Dead">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
