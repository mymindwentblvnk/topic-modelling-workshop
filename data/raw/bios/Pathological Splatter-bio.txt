Serbian brutal death metal/grindcore band Pathological Splatter was spawned in 2001, when Morbid, Bebac, Krsman and BlazaMad came together with an idea to create music inspired by everyday pathology. The lyrics are cruel and bloody but still represent reality and the band's attitude. So far the band released two albums - Theatre Of Blood and Humanhunt. This is probably one of the most devastating, ear bleeding, sick, perverse,  inhuman, bizarre project from ex-Yugoslavian underground society.   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pathological+Splatter">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
