This Broken Machine is a progressive alternative metal band founded on the idiosyncrasies of its members, born from 
the urge of expressing themselves unleashing the ghosts they carry inside.

Their conflicts and anxieties give birth to a genuine personal style, made of syncopated 
and powerful rhythms, dissonant and massive guitars, screamed and melodic voices, 
dark and oppressing atmospheres that melt into articulated tracks, building a coherent 
and homogeneous concept at the very same time. 
The tracks as a whole are thought as buildings, where the sum of simple yet different elements contributes to a complex plot, where every single part is necessary for the others.
Their first full length, The Inhuman Use of Human Beings (2012) is the natural result of this 
kind of approach: completely self produced in every detail, the album portrays feelings 
of alienation and distress caused by work or the lack of it. Working is not only a mean of 
support, but also a way of personal realization and for this reason unemployment and 
temporary employment represent a crucial existential uneasyness, which could results 
into nihilism and self destruction.
The Inhuman Use of Human Beings covers these themes using the allegory of the man/
machine relationship: the individual is seen as a gear of a global mechanism that, just 
like a shiny and pitiless god, allows survivalism only through the privation of human conscience and total obedience to the system.
The 13 tracks unveil a kind of harsh and tormented music, rough-edged and dark, with 
sporadic liquefied and thinner openings, covering angst, rage and frustration, but also 
hope and the will of redemption of men from their condition of suffering.
