Echoes of the Moon is a project that utilizes different genres of music under the umbrella "experimental metal." Such styles would include, black metal, post rock, shoegaze, doom metal, post metal, and psychedelic music.

"Esoteric" was released in July of 2014 and consisted of largely doom metal and black metal music. "Entropy" was released in July of 2015 and largely expanded Echoes' sound. The album is twice as long and displays more atmosphere as well as more clean passages. Both albums are available for free at https://echoesofthemoon.bandcamp.com/

In 2016, Avantgarde Music will release "Entropy" on CD in March and is available for preorder here: https://avantgardemusic.bandcamp.com/album/entropy
