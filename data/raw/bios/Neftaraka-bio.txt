Formed in diabolical moon anno 1996 under the cult NAZZATHRONE. Heavily inspired by old Dark Throne, Burzum,Von, Celtic Frost & Profanatica. The band consist only Dark Buruj on guitar & Xxxull (formely known as Dragonoath) on drum & voices. In the end of 1996 Lord (2nd guitar) and Sil-Blyss (bass) joined the band and decide to change their moniker to NEFTARAKA. One rehearsal tape has been recorded somewhere at SYJ Bazzar Bulat (Cult studios!) and this rehearsal tape has been buried by time and dust. Later after rehearsing and practice, we entered Revival Studio (RIP) and recorded our first debut demo entitled 'A.W.B.M'. This demo was successfully done using some odd recording style and has been released on early 1997 by Dark Holocaust Production (RIP). Lord & Sil-Blyss left the band due some internal problem and left Dark Buruj & Xxxull back to the early position. NEFTARAKA disbanned for a while in 2000 due personal problem and huge media freak propaganda on our local Underground scene. In this period nothing can be heard from us.

Untill 2004 when Xxxull meet Dark Buruj and decide to reformed back NEFTARAKA . Izfarator joined the band as a session drummer untill these day. Xxxull handling bass & voices. NEFTARAKA appear on certain local compilation as well and some releases.

NEFTARAKA are still standing proud at our own platform. NEFTARAKA hailed Black Metal in primitive, harsh, raw, cold & grim sounds. Praise to the souls of untouchable forest. The sacred and misanthropic ideology has been preach. We're the one who dwell within'.....
