Enthrone the Unborn was founded in Kerava (Finland) in 2011.Their biggest musical influences can be traced back to the Scandinavian melodic metal scene of pre-y2k, but the band has also spiced up its music with the atmosphere of the American metal scene of today.

Enthrone the Unborn consist of four members:
Guitar and growled vocals: Eero Harsunen
Guitar and clean vocals: Juhamatti Kauppinen
Bass: Joel Vakkila
Drums: Arttu Anttila

The quartet had played together before founding of ETU, between 2007-2010. Since then, the band's music has evolved a lot and the old songs are no longer played. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Enthrone+the+Unborn">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
