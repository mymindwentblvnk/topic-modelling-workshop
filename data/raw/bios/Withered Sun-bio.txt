Withered Sun is a six piece melodic death metal band from Massachusetts. With roots streaming from Gothenburg bands such as Dark Tranquillity, At the Gates, In Flames and Soilwork, Withered Sun takes melodic death, doom and thrash and combines them into a melodic composition filled with harmonies and aggression. 

Now starting with their new line up as of late 2008, they pride themselves on trying to standout in a music scene flooded by talented musicians and bands, and strive to their stamp on everything they do.

Withered Sun released a four song EP, The Relic, in October 2009. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Withered+Sun">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
