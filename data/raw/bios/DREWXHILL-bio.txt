Hailing from Denmark and Cologne respectively, Michelle Drew and Philipp Hill's paths first crossed in an unlikely city on the South Coast of the UK. The close knit scene of discerning music enthusiasts in Southampton provided a fertile breeding ground for a strong friendship to form; a friendship that quickly developed into a musical partnership.

They first bonded over a shared passion for deep, hypnotic and elusive sounds and a growing interest in music production. The catalyst for the conception of DREWXHILL was a differing skill set and the realisation that, musically, together Michelle and Philipp became more than the sum of their parts.

Drawing on a delicate mixture of syncopated production and freely moving live elements, the DREWXHILL sound is rooted in electronica but boasts a human feel. With Philipp’s penchant for subtly driving beats paired with Michelle's tender melodies and texture rich vocals the result is haunting and honest.

James Zabiela’s forward thinking Born Electric stable became home for the duo's debut EP ’Solitude’ and the recently released 'Bullets' EP with big remixes from Hotflush head honcho Scuba and the incredible Stimming. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/DREWXHILL">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
