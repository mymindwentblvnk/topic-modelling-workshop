Arch-Vile are an up-and-coming four-piece technical/progressive thrash/death metal band from New Jersey. While their music leans towards progressive thrash, they incorporate various influences, including math, death and doom metal, and as such can only be loosely categorized. While their music is technical, they play energetic and fun music, and have shamelessly over-the-top-brutal lyrics and themes. They recently released their first EP, Threshold of Pain, available on BandCamp at https://arch-vile.bandcamp.com/ for free or name-your-price.
