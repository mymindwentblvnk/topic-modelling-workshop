Valonsurma offers raw, hateful, hellishly catchy and above all pure black metal. Each song is a weapon in the war against philantropic oppression. Valonsurma stands for the BLACK METAL spirit but what band ultimately stand for is the destruction of humane scum. This band has nothing to do with angst-pussy poseurs or the disgusting must-have-synthetizers-vibe of todays "black" metal wave. Valonsurma does things its own way. it's time to destroy remeeder's filthy lambs.

'Call Of The Dark Ages' Rehearsal (1998)

'Vision Of The Unholy' Demo (2001)

A logical development from the dub-tape era. The music is primitive, and leans towards dirty soundscapes in its extremity.
No re-print, sold out for ever.

'The Dawn Of Destruction' Demo (2002)


'The Dawn Of Destruction' takes off where 'Vision Of The Unholy' left. At Dungeons Of Hate Chamber we achieved to find the right sound that would work best to bring the right feeling in the hymns.
