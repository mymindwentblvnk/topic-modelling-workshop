Scarlet Drop was formed 2005 in Sweden with an ambition to go far. Combining energetic stage performance, catchy melodies with a heavy edge is a challenging task for anyone, and Scarlet Drop attempts to do so with a professional attitude and full commitment. Without being bound by the limits of any particular style of music, Scarlet Drop combines singing and melodies with screaming and heavy riffs.

The diversity of the band has proved to be a great asset, both in terms of creating a unique sound with influences from different sources, and for attracting attention from bookers and promoters for the unique line-up. Two girls fronting on guitar and vocals are eye-catching and make the band stick out from other bands wherever they are playing. The band is also diverse in ethnicity, with half of the band hailing from Malta and in terms of musical background, with members ranging from schooling in classical music to completely self-taught.


In June 2009 the band were down in Germany to record their 4 track EP at Tin Roof studio, also founders of Ruuf Records. In previous years they have also worked together with guitar legend and producer Carl-Johan Grimmark (Narnia). They have also performed all over Sweden, Germany, Egypt and Malta. Scarlet Drop have played at some of the major fesitvals in Sweden some including Sweden Rock and Frizon, as well as Rock the North and Balinger Festival in Germany. 

They have shared the stage with US bands like The Letter Black, Spoken, Since October, Everyday Sunday, Run Kid Run..  

April 2011 brought their very first tour ever with German bands Freequency and Sacrety! 

2012 brings the release of their first full-length album.
