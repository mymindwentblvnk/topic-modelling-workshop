Hate Profile is the project led by one Amon 418, who started the venture in 1998 and, after working with various members for some time, proceeded as a solo project. He eventually joined Hortus Animae, recruiting noted session drummer GroM (also in Hortus Animae, among other projects) to complete the debut album, Opus 1: The Khaos Hatefile.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hate+Profile">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
