 * 2006 : Guest on the original soundtrack of the movie Je vais bien, ne t'en fais pas featured two songs by AaRON :
1. U-Turn (Lili) (the song has been integrated in the movie as a song written by a character for his sister ; the character of the sister has then been renamed in "Lili" to match the song). This song made the band very well known nationally.
2. Mister K.
On the first AaRON album, they covered the song Strange Fruit, a song which was made famous by Billie Holiday. The version they perform on the album is drawn largely from Nina Simone's rendition on her 1965 album Pastel Blues.
You can also find a great cover of Leonard Cohen's Famous Blue Raincoat on youtube.
