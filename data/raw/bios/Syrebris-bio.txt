Progressive death metallers, Syrebris is a 4 piece american band based in Los Angeles, CA. With such an unusual name, Syrebris (Sur-ree-briss) roots from the word Cerebral, meaning "pertaining to the Cerebrum or the brain." The band created the name to express the higher levels of consciousness that can be reached within the human mind. The inner peace that can be awakened within us all. Hoping to inspire many, together they experiment with genres ranging from progressive metal, death metal, thrash, to jazz, acoustic, to world music hoping to stimulate  and satisfy all emotions. With Syrebris, you will hear occasional clean soft guitars that break into unforgettable riffs of rage and melodic madness. This is just the beginning of their evolution. Expect new sounds to come as they are currently in the process of writing new material for their album. 

Syrebris are musicians who are always aiming to improve their skills technically, as well as their songwriting and creativity as a band. As they take on this musical route together, they continue to write music with a passion that streams from their heart and souls.
