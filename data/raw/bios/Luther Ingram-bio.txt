Luther Thomas Ingram (November 30, 1937 â€” March 19, 2007) was an R&B soul singer and songwriter.

Born in Jackson, Tennessee, his songs appeared in the pop and R & B charts, even though he worked for a small label, Koko Records, owned by his manager and producer, Johnny Baylor. Koko and Baylor were closely associated with the Memphis-based Stax Records label during the height of its commercial success.

Ingram is best known for his hit, "(If Loving You Is Wrong) I Don't Want to Be Right", written by Homer Banks, Carl Hampton and Raymond Jackson. The song placed number one on Billboard magazine's R&B chart, and peaked at number three on that publication's Hot 100 chart in 1972 (later successfully covered by Millie Jackson and Barbara Mandrell). Other popular tracks include "Ain't That Loving You (For More Reasons Than One)" and "I'll Be Your Shelter." He also co-authored the Staples Singers hit, "Respect Yourself."

Ingram was responsible for the classic 1966 Northern Soul stormer "If It's All The Same To You" and it's instrumental "Exus Trek" on HIB records.

Ingram died March 19, 2007 at a Belleville, Ill., hospital of heart failure. He had suffered for years from diabetes, kidney disease and partial blindness, his wife, Jacqui Ingram, said. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Luther+Ingram">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
