Up and coming artist Ayrtn may only be at the start of his music career but he has already proven a lot. The 19 year-old born and raised in South East London started producing at the age of 12 for fun. After recognising his talent he started to take it seriously between the ages of 16 and 17. Making beat after beat he decided to start rapping over them and upload them to Soundcloud. Through doing so he started to see a small success through gaining recognition from his musical peers, friends and his family. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ayrtn">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
