A symphonic black metal band from France. The band was formed in 1999 by Count Delictii and Sephiroth. In 1999 they released their first demo called Anorexia. In 2004 they released their first full-length album entitled Phiselide (...Summoning the Blackest Emotions). Although they play in the symphonic black metal genre, they actually do not use too many keyboards or orchestrations. The focus is on the guitars & fast drumming.
