Hailing from Birmingham, United Kingdom, Sam Redmore has built a name for himself over the last few years for crafting sure-fire soul-drenched music specifically made to provide a unique stamp on his DJ sets. Ranging from cumbia, afrobeat, samba, funk and reggae, through to house, broken beat, disco and everything in between, his original music, remixes and reworkings of classics (by the likes of Bob Marley, Q-Tip, Chic and Talking Heads) continue to find their way into the record boxes of discerning DJs worldwide. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sam+Redmore">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
