Bio
Project Arcadia is a Bulgarian modern melodic/power metal band. We recorded our new album "A Time Of Changes" with one of the best singers in the genre - Urban breed, whom you might know from his work with bands such as TAD MOROSE, BLOODBOUND and TRAIL OF MURDER. It's already been mixed and mastered and we're about to start looking for a label to release it. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Project+Arcadia">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
