Death Yell were a short-lived Chilean black/death metal band formed in 1988 in Santiago, Chile. They released a demo in 1989 titled "Vengeance from Darkness" which was subsequently reissued in a shortened 7'' vinyl version in 1990 and again in 1992 under the title "Morbid Rites". A track from the demo appeared on a split with Beherit  in 1991. In 2007 Nuclear War Now! released the demo and a rare live performance titled "Morbid Rites" on CD and double LP.
