two members from Gastric Haemorrhage, one member from Childcancer and one member from Nasty Toilet Productions formed a new band called Haemorrhoids Infection with influences from Cliteater, Psyopus, Devourment, F.U.B.A.R and not forget Waking the Cadaver but... that doesnt mean we sound anything like that, we really dont! just wait a few months and well notify when our songs are up 
our lyrical themes are mostly about sadistic deaths, porn, necrophillia, gore and cannibalism
