Beyond Black Void is one of Stijn Van Cauter's many projects (Until Death Overtakes Me, The Ethereal).
We know that this Belgian guy products a lot of depressive and awfully slow music, and Beyond Black Void is probably his heaviest project : minimalistic Drone/Funeral Doom, very beautiful and enigmatic. No keyboards. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Beyond+Black+Void">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
