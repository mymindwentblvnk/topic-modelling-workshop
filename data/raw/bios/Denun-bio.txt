Denun is a metal band from Santiago, Chile. At the beginning of 2001, Claudio Molina and Paula Vilches initiated an idea called "Deumadenun" (to do justice in mapudungun). Both wanted to create a band of rock and metal, with a little of ethnic Chilean music. Nevertheless it is in the year 2002 when thereÂ´s created the first line-up of Denun, and the current keyboard player Leonardo Rebolledo joins the band. After some line-up changes they return to the fundamental essence of their offer, staying only a trio, those who continue recruiting musical people. In 2003 Javier Iglesias in guitar, Luis Osses in drums and Jaime Navarrete in bass join the band, being this way the way towards the style of the band, mixing strong sounds in strings and percussions with melancholy keyboards and harmonious vocal compositions. Later and for several reasons the name of the band is changed to Denun. In February, 2004, they recorded a demo to prove the real sound of the band and to continue spreading their music. With an acceptable result, in 2005 they recorded "Toluken", their first album.
