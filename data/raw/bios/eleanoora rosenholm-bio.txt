Eleanoora Rosenholm comes from Pori, Finland and is a project begun by Noora Tommila, Pasi Salmi and Mika Rättö. They crafted a genius pop album with murderous lyrics inside the dark stonewalls that surround SS-Palace studio. Time came to get the show on the road and the band evolved into a full 8 piece with Mika Rättö working as a background godfather and often watching the band as a part of the audience. With Noora's amazing vocal work and the genius backing band they create a disco any housewife serial killer would be proud to dance in. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Eleanoora+Rosenholm">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
