Based out of Brisbane, Australia Yoste is the moniker of young singer-songwriter-producer Kurt Sines. With influences drawn from ambient to pop, the project’s unique and moving music has swiftly gained worldwide attention. Boasting over 70 million streams and a debut EP heralded by standout singles “Arc” and “Blue” released in February 2019.  "The big picture for me is to make concise, deep pop music. It's such a simple and commonly held goal, and yet I don't see the point in attempting to do anything less.You try to answer your own questions via the music and try to comment on what you see around you and basically try to make something cathartic that fits the moment you're in," Yoste reveals about the project.  "I write a lot about apathy. To my mind, a lot of young, liberal, passionate people have lost some of our edge and self-awareness, and there's a little more room to be self-referential and sardonic." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Yoste">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
