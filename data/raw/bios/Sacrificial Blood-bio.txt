Sacrificial Blood has carried the torch for true underground metal for nearly 10 years.
Through many lineup changes, virtual indifference from the larger metal community, 
the underground itself being marketed into a fashionable trend by mainstream 
America, and a complete detestation for the entire "Retro-Metal" movement, Sacrifical Blood never lost site of it's intention  to deliver fast, raw, aggressive, honest metal for the true metal people who actually live for this music rather than just being into whats cool for the moment. 2 demos, 4 splits, and a recently released full length album are Sacrificial Blood's testimony to it's endless fight, which despite the setbacks, they've yet to fully back down from or give in to. The band plans to enter the studio again in the summer of 2011 to record the second full length, which will hopefully be released before years end.....  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sacrificial+Blood">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
