Haceldama is born in mid 2004 with Clandestine as the mastermind and sole member, with the purpose of creating Black Metal in the old fashioned way. Marked by strong anti-christian beliefs and charged with a grim, heavy atmosphere.

The first stage was known for its raw yet hypnotic sound, with Clandestine on all instruments and Flagrum on vocal duties in Haceldama´s first demo Worship The Unlight, wich closed this stage. 100 limited Pro tapes of this demo have been released by the Music From Hell record label in december of 2006.

Now Clandestine conjured a complete line-up featuring Horrid (Innsmouth and Cult of Hate) on bass and vocals, and Bloodthirsty on drums, all with the intention of recording a new album. This work has already been composed and it´s on recording process already. It is expected to be released in 2007.

With a much more mature and complete sound, Haceldama now feels like it was intended to in the first place; live drums have given it the right touch. The band has started regular rehearsal sessions and has joined the rising local True Black Metal scene. The official single from the upcoming Wrathrone EP can be listened to in the music section.

On December 8 was released the SPLIT CD UNHOLY BLACK ATTACK (Innsmouth/Haceldama) by VM Records. It's a release for Dominican Republic, we're looking for a label who re-release the split.

Finally In the first quarter of the year 2008 will be released our EP WRATHRONE by Cursed Origin (CHILE). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Haceldama">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
