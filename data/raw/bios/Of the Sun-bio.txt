There are currently 2 Of The Sun's.

1.) Boston Based Experimental Tribal Psychedelic Rock group. Of The Sun has been growing from the solo projects of Adam Blake, Tom Fahey and CJ Carr. Sounds reminiscing with many different cultures and minds. Live shows are accompanied with visuals being projected onto the band, creating a mental escape/exploration from your current place in time. Ritual music from Future Shamans.

2.) If you're looking to scrobble the artist "Of The Sun" from Myrtle Beach, SC consisting of the Duvall brothers, the artist tag should be "OfTheSun" http://www.last.fm/music/OfTheSun
