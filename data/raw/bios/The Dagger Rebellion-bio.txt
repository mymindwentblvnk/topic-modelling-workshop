The Dagger Rebellion was born in 2005, based in Cleveland,OH, and founded by Paul Kahan (Vocals) and Shawn Kahan (Rhythm Guitar), since then the addition of Nick Hawkins (Lead Guitar) the band has been on a nonstop rampage through Cleveland’s local metal scene, drawing hundred’s to venues such as the Grog Shop and Peabody’s Downunder, and having the privilege of opening the American Carnage Tour featuring Slayer, Megadeth, and Testament.

The band has adopted a style reminiscent of American post-thrash, fused with early 90’s Gothenburg metal, along with pieces of progressive rock, blues, and taking influence from several sects of music, not just metal. The Cleveland born band is known for its chameleon like sound which focuses more on individual moods and soundscapes than a unifying band sound. Though there are several signatures the band leaves in its path, it is a prerogative of the band to never create the same song twice.

In its 5 year history the band has had the privilege to open for national acts such as, Slayer, Megadeth, Testament, Soilwork, Exodus, Shadows Fall, Trivium,Winds of Plague, Symphony X, Strapping Young Lad, Darkest Hour, Mnemic, Goatwhore, Protest The Hero, The Sword, Cattle Decapitation, Caliban, The Acacia Strain, Stick To Your Guns, Mychildrenmybride, Light This City, Into Eternity, Epica, Echoes of Eternity, Kittie, The Autumn Offering, Full Blown Chaos, Byzantine, Threat Signal. As well as appeared at local venues such as Peabody’s Downunder, Pirates Cove, Phantasy Concert Club, Hifi Concert Club, Jigsaw Saloon, The Cove, Grog Shop, and more. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Dagger+Rebellion">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
