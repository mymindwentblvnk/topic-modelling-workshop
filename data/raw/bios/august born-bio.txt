A Pan-Pacific collaboration between Six Organs of Admittance’s Ben Chasny and Japanese artist Hiroyuki Usui (Fushitsusha, A-Musik, Marble Sheep, L). Begun as a game that was based on the idea of “fortuitous mistranslation,” a concept wherein even if each person couldn’t exactly understand what the other wanted to do or go with the music, the music would find its own direction. The songs were sent across the Pacific Ocean five times, gaining texture and direction in the process. Eleven mellow tracks that seamlessly blend Hiroyuki’s guitar, vocals, vibes, harmonium, bass, drums, cello, and more with Chasny’s distinct guitar and vocal style. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/August+Born">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
