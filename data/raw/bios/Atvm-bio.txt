Based in North London, Atvm have been purveying unhinged, proggy death metal since 2013. Their spliffy riffs will delight fans of bands such as Gorguts, Diskord and Revocation.
After releasing their first EP, Out Of Chaotic Waters (2015), founding guitarist Max left and Atvm were reborn as a fourpiece: Harry Bray (vocals), Tom Calcraft (guitars), Luke Abbott (bass), and Francis Ball (drums).
Atvmâ€™s debut album, Famine, Putrid and Fucking Endless (2021), was mixed and mastered by Colin Marston and garnered worldwide critical acclaim. Later that year, Atvm signed a multi-album deal with Transcending Obscurity Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Atvm">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
