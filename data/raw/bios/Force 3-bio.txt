UK Christian rock/metal band in the NWOBH vein.  At least one appearance at Greenbelt (Christian music and arts festival) in 2006.  It is possible that the 8 track album 'Warrior of Light' released in 1988 is the recording by the band but this delivers 32 minutes of classic metal with some blistering shredding, riffage and sing-a-long, air-punching choruses.   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Force+3">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
