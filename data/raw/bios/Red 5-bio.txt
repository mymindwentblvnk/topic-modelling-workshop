RED 5 was a successful dance-act created by the German DJ/producer Thomas Kukula. Between 1996-2000 they had a bunch of massive club-hits, like "Da Beat Goes...", "I Love You ... Stop" or "Lift Me Up".

The name "RED 5" is most likely a nod to Star Wars - A New Hope in which Luke Skywalker flys an X-Wing with the callsign "Red 5". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Red+5">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
