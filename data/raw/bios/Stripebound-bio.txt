Stripebound are a 5 piece from Sweden, and yet another example of how they seem to be able to do heavy music better than the brits (and pretty much everyone else). It must be something in the water.
The music is a mix of classic hardcore and 90s metal with a strong Death Metal influence. This should not be confused with Deathcore - this has more of a classic edge to it.

With band members being veterans of various bands, this is the first release of Stripebound, who are a hard-working live band - playing regularly in and around their native Sweden. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/StripeBound">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
