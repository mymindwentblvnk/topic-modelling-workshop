Viking Funeral consists of one person, Eric The Viking. Eric played bass for The Party Wreckers based out of Philadelphia, PA, and while they have been on a long hiatus, he put together a few songs, and recorded some tracks at his home studio (Doublewide Studios). The track Untimely was the first track he recorded which has a raw speed metal sound and feel, while Reverend Jones, the latest track he has recorded, is a doom metal opus, with amazing production and vocal melodies. Those songs and everything in between show not only how oneâ€™s writing can progress, but the skill involved in recording and mixing everything down can progress as well. Eric the Viking has become a metal God locally and is currently enlisting a full backing band to take Viking Funeral on the road to a wider audience. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Viking+Funeral">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
