Alughana was a band from Antwerp, Belgium.

Alughana has known quite a few members through it's history. The line-up changed a couple of times and ended up with "Thierry Verduyckt" on guitars, bagpipes and didge , "Tommy De Ruyck" on Lead Guitar, "Raf gielis" on Drums, "Els Embrechts" on Violin and "Leonard Van Herwijnen" on Vocals.

You cannot define its music in one word. One says it's Ghanese Aluminium Rock, the other calls it Ambient Folk Metal, a third describes it as new dimension of Crossover. 
In a way, they're all right, but Alughana just wanted to be itself. A fascinating mix of all kinds of styles and influences from a dreamworld filled with contrasts.

3 Remaining members: Leonard, Raf and Tommy are still working on a new project which will start of around 2008. Yet a nameless project.
