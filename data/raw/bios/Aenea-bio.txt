AeneA was formed circa 2008 in San Diego County, California with the sole purpose of creating a unique blend of progressive and melodic metal with powerful delivery and an unrestrained sense of experimentation. Constantly trying to transcend formulaic song structure and instead establish a story-like quality to songwriting; often in a seemingly perpetual flow of vivid imagery and groovy textures.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Aenea">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
