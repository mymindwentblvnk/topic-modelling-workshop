Los Halos is the brainchild of Samezvous (Eli Wegner) and a variety of friends who began recording together in Philadelphia in the late 80s. Never a fixed target, the music that Los Halos produced always reflected the lives of those in the band, from the raging post-rock droning jams of their early work to mostly acoustic folk-oriented songs and finally to well-crafted angular indie pop.  Los Halos plays like an open-door confessional with Samezvous presenting astonishingly personal music that never falls prey to being emo or self-absorbed. Sometimes coming off like Mountain Goats with a score to settle, the band spent the next twenty years endlessly producing music that has been gathered together and made available in five volumes available at loshalos.com.

Samezvous has been working with a variety of other projects, including The Middle Wages and Cats in the Grass. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Los+Halos">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
