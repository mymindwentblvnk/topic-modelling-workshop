Former Negură Bunget.

Wiccan Rede was a symphonic black metal formed in 1994 in Timisoara, Romania. Line-up consisted of: Hupogrammos Disciple's (guitar, vocals), Aiwazz Vallach Disciple (keyboards, vocals) and Black Pharmakeya Pepóromenée (drums). They only released a 6-track demo in November 1995 titled From Transilvanian Forests. Later that year, Wiccan Rede evolved into Negură Bunget.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wiccan+Rede">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
