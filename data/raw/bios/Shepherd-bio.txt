1)Shepherd is a Bangalore (India)-based sludge/heavy rock band that's been making waves in the underground since its coming together in early 2011. Drawing Influence from the guitar driven sounds of early 90's hard rock (Soundgarden, The Melvins, Eyehategod) and 80's hardcore punk (Black Flag, Discharge), the band has built a reputation for itself as an ever-evolving and unpredictable heavy rock entity.
