Brother Cesare Bonizzi, also known as Frate Cesare and Fratello Metallo ("Brother Metal") - which is also the name of his band, (born 1946) is a Franciscan monk belonging to the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin, who has become known in recent years as a heavy metal singer.

Bonizzi was born in 1946 in Offanengo, Italy. He entered a convent in 1975, and subsequently carried out missionary work in the Ivory Coast. After returning to Italy he was ordained a priest in 1983. Since 1990 he has been Interested in using music as a means of contemplation and spiritual devotion, and he has released numerous albums in various styles from new age to rock. After seeing Metallica in concert, however, he became passionate about heavy metal as a musical vehicle. According to him, "Metal is the most energetic, vital, deep and true musical language that I know." He currently lives in the convent of Musocco, a district of Milan.

Although his full transformation to heavy metal is only found on Fratello Metallo's 2008 release Misteri, Bonizzi has recorded numerous albums in various musical genres. He cites Megadeth and Metallica as major inspirations on his transformation to metal. With his new style of music, which he calls "Metrock" as a combination of metal and rock, he was the opening act at 2008's Gods of Metal, Italy's largest heavy metal festival.

Bonizzi performs in full Franciscan habit. Although he is frequently seen making the sign of the horns in concert, he interprets it as sign language for love and not as a sign of the devil.
