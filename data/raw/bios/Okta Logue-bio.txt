Based in Frankfurt, Germany, Okta Logue was formed by Benno Herz, Robi Herz and Philip Meloi 3 years ago as Zapphire Okta Logue but, with the addition of the fourth member Nicolai Hildebrandt, the band found their sound and a new name. Their last album, Ballads of a Burden was released on Nasoni found some critical acclaim.

As Okta Logue prepare for the release of their third studio album the influence of their own side projects is becoming apparent. Rollergirls; powerchording energetic postrock and the Benno Herz Band; a somewhat more relaxed indi folk creation are being gently folded into the Progressive, Psychedelic tones of Okta Logue to create something quite unique.

The first song on the recording "Bright Lights" has old Prog Rockers holding back tears of reminiscence as the video, produced and directed by Nicolai, swoops around a slow motion garden party to the undulant tone of Benno Herz and Crew. The video won several awards and enjoyed several film festival showings.

Their new album is due to be released early 2012 on Hazelwood Vinyl Plastics. Guitarist Meloi is the one to watch here with swooping solos and impeccable timing. The often idiosyncratic style of drummer Robert Herz deserves special mention. Its not often the time keeper is able to paint a picture in this manner.

Think early Pink Floyd and your halfway there. For now. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Okta+Logue">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
