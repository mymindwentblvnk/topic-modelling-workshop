Richard William Wright (born 28th July, 1943 London, UK - 15th September, 2008) was the keyboardist for the rock band Pink Floyd. He, along with Roger Waters, Nick Mason and Syd Barrett formed the original lineup of Pink Floyd and was an extremely important part of the early Pink Floyd sound. 

He made several key contributions but perhaps his best known work with Pink Floyd is The Great Gig  In The Sky. He was fired from the band in 1979 due to both personal problems and relationship problems with Roger Waters. He played as a hired session player on The Wall shows and like Nick Mason has played with Pink Floyd on every tour.

Rick was made a member of the band again in 1987, after Roger had left and the new Gilmour-led Pink Floyd had released 'A Momentary Lapse Of Reason'.

Wright released 2 solo albums, "Wet Dream" (1978) and "Broken China" (1996).
He also formed the short-lifed experimental duo Zee with Dave Harris. They only released one unsuccessfull album, "Identity", in 1984. Wright later described Zee as an "experimental mistake".

Richard Wright died on 15 September 2008 after a short battle with cancer. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Richard+Wright">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
