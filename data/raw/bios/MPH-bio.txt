Quebec City, August 2007. Just before leaving Canada for London, Marie-Pascale feels the urge to write songs. 
Led by her musical intuition and her lack of virtuosity, she composes spontaneous quirky pop songs with charming melodies. 
Once settled in London, she brought together musicians to help her bringing her songs to another level.

'Honey Pine Dresser' was born in February 2008 when she met the multi talented and visionary Rob and Becky the fascinating cellist.
