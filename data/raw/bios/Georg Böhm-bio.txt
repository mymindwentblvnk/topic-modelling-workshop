Georg Böhm (2 September 1661 Hohenkirchen, Thuringia – 18 May 1733) was a German Baroque organist and composer.
He is notable for his development of the chorale partita and for his influence on the young J. S. Bach.

Böhm is mainly known for his compositions for the flute, pipe organ and harpsichord (primarily preludes, fugues, and partitas).
Many of his works were designed with flexibility of instrument in mind: a particular piece could be played on the organ, the harpsichord, or the clavichord, depending on the situation in which the performer found himself.
Böhm's music is notable for its use of the stylus phantasticus, a style of playing based on improvisation.
 
Böhm's most important contribution to North German keyboard music is the chorale partita, a large-scale composition consisting of several variations on a particular chorale melody.
He effectively invented the genre, writing several partitas of varying lengths and on diverse tunes.
Later composers also took up the genre, most notably Johann Sebastian Bach.
Böhm's chorale partitas feature sophisticated figuration in several voices over the harmonic structure of the chorale.
His partitas generally have a rustic character and can be successfully performed on either the organ or the harpsichord.
