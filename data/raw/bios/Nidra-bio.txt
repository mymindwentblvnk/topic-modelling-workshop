They were organized in 2011 as a project consisting of two guys: Cold - music, Dozhd' - vocal, lyrics. The band develops its music using black-metal basis, at the same time they are not limited by style frameworks. The name of the band means "sleep" from a Sanskrit. In their understanding it is equating with the existence of people in depressing conditions with all pessimism in this world, which is based on metaphysics and subjective perception of environment.
