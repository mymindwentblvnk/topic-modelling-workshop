Forge is the name of multiple artists.

1) Forge are an Industrial Black Metal band from Paris, France composed of four members (DVA, T.L.S.N, F(t)M and Massengrab). Formed in 1997, they recorded a promo in 1998 before finally releasing their debut EP in 2001. It was entitled "War, the World's Only Hygiene". The band took a long hiatus some time after December 2003 before finally getting back together to rehearse in January of 2007.

2) Forge disbanded in late 2004 and played their final show on November 20, 2004 at Alvin's in Detroit, MI.

Forge could best be described as a heavy, melodic combination of loud rock and metal influences. Their sound consisted of a distinctive dual-guitar approach, reinforced by a roaring, overdriven bass, and solidified by hard hitting, thunderous drums. Forge's sound was completed by Aaron's melodic, intense and forceful vocal style that passionately conveys their lyrics.

Forge played every show as if it were their lastâ€¦ A combustible combination of raw energy, power, emotion and volume...The creation and sharing of this energy between the band and their fans is what the members of Forge lived for.

Forge built an ever growing fan base through endless touring around the mid-west, east & west coasts as well as sharing the stage with such national acts as: Prong, Thin Lizzy, In Flames, Ill Nino, Nevermore, Mushroomhead, Taproot, Rival Schools, Shadow's Fall and many more.

3) Forge is a symphonic black/folk metal band from Bern, Switzerland. They released a full-length album Heimdall in 2018.

4) Stoner/sludge/doom metal from Michigan City, Indiana, United Statess
