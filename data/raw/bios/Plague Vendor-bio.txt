Based out of Whittier, California, a suburb of Los Angeles, Plague Vendor are a punk band who harness their nervy, nocturnal energy into their driving sound. Made up of singer Brandon Blaine, guitarist Jay Rogers, bassist Michael Perez, and drummer Luke Perine, the band's sound blends the urgency of early post-punk with the reckless attitude of hardcore, creating a style that squirms with nervous energy while it refuses to sit still. In 2014, the band signed on with the legendary punk label Epitaph, where they released their concise debut, Free to Eat, in the spring of that year. Recorded over the course of two weeks with producer and engineer Stuart Sikes (the Walkmen, Cat Power, Modest Mouse), the band issued their propulsive sophomore outing, Bloodsweat, in early 2016. ~ Gregory Heaney
