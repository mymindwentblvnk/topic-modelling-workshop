Vita Imana is a powerful metal group, whose music is characterized mainly by the overwhelming rythmical base created by a battery that unfolds, as much accelerated and frenetic rates as other dense and heavy... this one are complemented perfectly with a line of additional percussion (darbuka, djembe, surdo, berimbao...), inserting this way the tribal character that the group makes feel in its music, doing echoes of ethnic rates of different countries like Morocco, Egypt, Turkey, Australia, Senegal... 

The guitars, with ultraserious refining, offer riffs demolishing connected with extreme coherence one after another one, followed by a line of low that provides the heavy weight to the sound of Vita Imana. As far as the voice, a this one manifest extreme degree of aggressiveness that arrives until the limits of the paranoia, transmitting in the messages ambiguous, but constant sensations: madness, hysteria, rage..., but mainly, force to emerge in the realities that asphyxiate to us. It is this mixture of the more forceful modern metal and the tribal rates of percussion which makes the sound so peculiar of the group. 

The style and the form to compose the songs are born like necessity to express the creativity that takes inside, fed by an enormous amount of influences of all type. All these influences put in common give like fruit more or less original subjects, but that they do not leave indifferent that listens to them. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vita+Imana">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
