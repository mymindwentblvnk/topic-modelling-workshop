Fort Worthâ€™s Four Days To Burn are dirty, greasy, unforgiving and exactly as ugly as a Southern Sludge band should be. Smeared with stinging feedback and convulsive sample scowl, the quintet spit out burly, barbed-wire wreckage that smashes itself apart in a haze of deconstructive downtune. Four Days To Burn features former and current members of  Garuda, The El Salvador Birthday Bash, Dirt Merchant & Cadillac To Mexico. Steeped in the local punk and metal scene for years, Four Days To Burn create a sound that is plodding, thick, and totally sludged out. A twin vocal attack adds to the confusion and intensity. The debut 7" was released by Dada Drumming on October 31st, 2006. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Four+Days+To+Burn">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
