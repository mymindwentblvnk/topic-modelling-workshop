-The Ignition-
The Lucifer Principle started out at the end of 2004, within 8 months, the band released two well received demo’s (“Burn!” &  “Flamethrower”). The Lucifer Principle makes a difference to al other deathmetal bands by using a stand up bass  instead of a electric bass, the stand up bass underlines the groovy character of the songs. The music of TLP is best described by the term “Stomping Deathmetal”, a mixture between old school heavy metal, rock ‘n roll and groove, all connected by a firm and edgy death metal base.

-What’s  in a  name-
The Lucifer Principle finds a great source of inspiration in a book (The Lucifer Principle), written by Howard Bloom. This book describes the origin of human nature, where violence and “evil” are the basic ingredients in ones being.
We have been brought up with the thought that violence doesn’t solve  anything, history however, proofs  that violence solves al great deal of problems. The greatest civilisations (including their problems) have fallen victim to violence and disappeared to make place for a new way of thinking.  The Lucifer Principle stands also for the avalanche-effect,  or action = reaction, something TLP practices when playing live.

-The Fire-
Besides a tour with Entombed, TLP has played with a wide variety of bands (like:  Obituary, Devildriver, Napalm Death, Dew-Scented, Blood Red Throne and for example Holy Moses),. In a very short period of time, The Lucifer Principle achieved a very good live reputation,  where energy and interaction are the main ingredients. It’s a matter of  Action = Reaction!

-In the heat of the moment-
After the release of two successful demo’s and loads of shows in and outside of Holland, TLP is ready to turn the page and take the next step in the bands future. At the beginning of 2007  The Lucifer Principle started working on the debut album. Together with the help of engineer Cees Pols (case i/0 studio, Steenwijk) The Lucifer Principle started of with the recording of “Pitch Black dawn”. Besides a selection of three re-recorded demo tracks, the band recorded six brand-new tunes.  Pitch Black Dawn was mixed and Mastered by Textures’ guitar player  Jochem Jacobs at Split Second Sound. The result is best described as a  old school death metal sound with a modern twist.


-Pitch Black Dawn-
Pitch Black Dawn stands for everything that is evil, the album title compiles what you can expect of this debut. The concept of violence, in a wide perspective, is visualized by Sieger Miedema, who did an awesome job in capturing the dark atmosphere of the songs and their lyrics.  



Be ready for a PITCH BLACK DAWN!
