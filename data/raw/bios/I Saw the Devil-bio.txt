1. I Saw the Devil consists of three members, all of which are in their early twenties and based in Dublin, Ireland. The music draws on the influences of both hard-hitting metal riffs from bands like Metallica and Mastodon and the more progressive harmonic trajectory inherent in the music of Pink Floyd and Yes, a mixture often spiced up by frequent rhythmic kicks and alterations which, combined with a dense arrangement of ethereal strings, keys and choirs, helps to define the sound as ‘progressive rock.’ All three players are seasoned practitioners, each with years of experience both on the stage and in the studio.

Their debut E.P., ‘A Howling At Sundown’ was recorded in the first half of 2011 in County Kerry, and was self-released in September 2011. The  E.P. consists of four songs, thematically based on the Greek Tragedy ‘The Oresteia’, which will be the subject of their debut album, currently being written and demoed.
