Relics Of Martyrs is a Jordanian death/thrash metal band. In 2008 summer, two brothers from Jordan ( Hrayr & Masis ) decided to form a band, and with that Relics of Martyrs was born, with Zaher and Amr joining in, the picture was missing only one last touch to be filled later by Yazan's involvement.
Creating Metal with the Middle Eastern touch gave them the unique/concrete sound that possesses them this very day, blessed by each member's wide ranged musical background to be shown with each track they compose.
After all the struggles Relics Of Martyrs has been through NoiseHead Records gave the world a chance to witness the beauty of the Middle Eastern music combined with the brutality of Metal's punch, as they ride the New Wave of Middle Eastern Metal with the solid Metal sense that has been missing since the 90's. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Relics+Of+Martyrs">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
