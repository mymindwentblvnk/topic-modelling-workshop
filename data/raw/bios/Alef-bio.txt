Alef is a quartet (Sadato - saxes / synth / compositions; Gunn - guitars; Kato - bass / synth; Ishida - drums / percussion) that casts a very wide stylistic net in a determinedly Dadaistic fashion.
They have only one album , Hajime! (1987) <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Alef">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
