Milk & Sugar are German-based dance music producers/record label owners Mike Milk (real name, Michael Kronenberger) and Steven Sugar (real name, Steffen Harning).

The two have collaborated together since 1993 under a variety of names, including Axis, Hitch Hiker & Jacques Dumondt, and Mike Stone & Steve Heller, and have scored major club hits internationally, including a remake of John Paul Young's "Love Is In The Air", with vocals re-recorded by Young in 2001.

It wasn't until 2004, however, that they would score their biggest hit in the United States when "Let The Sunshine In," an Ibiza-inspired remake of the Fifth Dimension's #1 hit from 1969, "Aquarius/Let The Sunshine In" and featured the vocals of British singer Lizzy Pattinson, went all the way to #1 on Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. The song also gave Radikal Records its first ever #1 as a label on the charts. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Milk+&+Sugar">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
