A Vintage Dark Rock Creation

If you are reading this that means you have met us - Balkhara.
We have brought you a mixture of different influences from different rock and metal music styles and that combination is forming something like dark rock spiced with little bit melancholy.

We hope you like our music and enjoy your stay here.
