Born in Eritrea and raised in Amsterdam, RIMON has been on an unusual journey to become one of the most intriguing singers of her generation. Deliberately lo-fi and recorded in a bedroom studio in the East of the city, her sound incorporates elements of dancehall, neo-soul and hip hop. The result is a distinctly modern vibe that borrows nostalgia from past greats without getting lost in it. She’s been hailed as the new face of Dutch music and with just three tracks to her name it’s safe to say shes just getting started. We’re pretty sure she’s going to be everywhere next year so we got to know more about the rising singer for this week’s Internet Crush.
