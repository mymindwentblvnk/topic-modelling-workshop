Ryuken hail from Torbay, UK. Formed in the spring of 2005, Ryuken are the ulitimate in street fighter fuelled progressive metal! Consisiting of Tom Adam Karl and 16 yr old Henry on guitar, these 4 chaps tear up the south west music scene providing an intensly proffesional, intimate and intese live show! they have recently come of of a months UK tour where they played with the likes of "The Blackout" and "Enter Shikari" - more dates are to follow. Visit www.myspace.com/ryukenuk! DO IT!

Adam has exited the band now and sean [former skip to fault] has taken his place.

Ryuken are back, seeing frontman Tom leave the band, Ryuken have brought in a second guitarist by the name of Smollis, Jay taking the spot of bassist, and introducing Ryuken's new lead singer Milo into the mix.
After time off to record and write new material they have re-emerged with a new single entitles "This Escape was planned", which has a very distinctive Devil Sold His Soul element to it and full of screaming vocals and energetic riffs. Many are uncertain about the new Ryuken style, but im sure it'll grow on us and Ryuken will be back to impressing their fan base.

Ryuken are set to play a host of gigs around the Exeter/Plymouth area, including playing alongside the likes of Blessthefall, Nato and the amazing Silverstein in November at Exeter Cavern.

So all in all, Ryuken are back, with a new line-up, a new sound, a new style. Lets hope that 2007-2008 brings success to Ryuken, as no doubt they deserve it.
