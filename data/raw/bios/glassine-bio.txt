Glassine was a mid-90's psychedelic folk project from Oakland, California, United States of Brian Lucas (Free Rein) and Glenn Donaldson, who later co-founded the Jewelled Antler Collective and Thuja.

In 2001 Donaldson's label Jewelled Antler released Glassine album Birds Are the Life of the Sky that included their tracks recorded between 1995 and 1997 on 4-track cassette. You can hear the hiss and echo buried roots of Donaldson's later projects like The Birdtree, The Ivytree and Giant Skyflower Band and also the strong influence of New Zealand's Xpressway cassette label. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Glassine">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
