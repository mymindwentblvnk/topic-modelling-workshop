Rudhira had it's humble beginnings in june 2010 when Andreas, Lars, Ole-Martin and Tomas decided to form a new band together. The members were familiar with each other from previous projects. The boys already had some writing and recording done - stressing the need to start a band. Rudhira was officially formed on april 10. 2011.

The band held a low presence during it's first years due to writing, recording, re-recording and rehearsing music, as well as growing as a band.

On june 1st 2012 Rudhiras debut album, Ein, was released worldwide on Pug-Nose Records - thus making it available on major streaming and download services. A limited CD-release soon followed and the band began to regularly play live again.

Rudhiras sound is rooted in heavy-metal, but has both progressive and melodic traits as well as elements from other genres.

Rudhira now progresses as a band writing new music and playing live. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rudhira">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
