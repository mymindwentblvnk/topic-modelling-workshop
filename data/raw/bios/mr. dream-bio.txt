“The Brooklyn post-punk trio are part of our Class Of 2010 largely because they write smart, ballsy songs.” 
-- BRANDON STOSUY, STEREOGUM ‘CLASS OF 2010’

“An antidote to the pulseless navel-gazing of certain lo-fi softies of late.” 
-- JULIANNE SHEPHERD, THE FADER

“They are making exactly the kind of brainy yet very physical rock music that is always desirable but generally scarce, especially in the past decade.” 
-- MATTHEW PERPETUA, FLUXBLOG

After last year’s run of critically acclaimed singles (“Knuckle Sandwich”, “Knick Knack”, “Scarred For Life”, “Learn The Language”), Brooklyn’s Mr. Dream presents its debut album TRASH HIT. It’s an ambitious rock record that marries extremes: harsh noise and catchy melodies, bizarre song structures and straight-ahead pop sensibilities. This is music unabashedly working in the tradition of some of the greatest rock acts: Buzzcocks, Pixies, Nirvana, Guided By Voices, and the Breeders. Mr. Dream picks up where those bands left off, further exploring the textures of aggressive rock music that’s unafraid to have strong hooks and thoughtful lyrics.
