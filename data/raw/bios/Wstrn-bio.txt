WSTRN consists of Akelle Charles, Haile and Louis Rei.[1] The name bears no relevance to westerns; according to the band, the name represents positive vibrations[2] and to them means that it is "West London's turn to shut down the scene".[3] Akelle and Haile are cousins who know Louis through their inhabitance of West London, while Akelle is the brother of singer Angel[1] and was part of a band with him and his three other siblings called the Charles Family, co-managed by the late reggae singer Smiley Culture and Akelle's father, Tendai Charles, who was in the same reggae group as Haile's father. The group failed to achieve mainstream success despite being the subject of a BBC documentary One Life.[4] <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wstrn">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
