Gangsta Pat (born Patrick Hall) is a rapper from Memphis, Tennessee who established himself in the Memphis underground during the late 1980s. Gangsta Pat is also one of the first rap artists from the city to make the move from an indie label to a major label when signing to Atlantic records during the start of the Gangsta rap era. Though, with a promising start, Pat never gained the notoriety nor the success like his Memphis rap peers, Three 6 Mafia and 8 Ball & MJG, who also signed to major labels during the early 1990s. Since then, Pat has returned to the Memphis underground rap scene and is viewed by the younger Memphis rappers as one of many pioneers to Memphis rap. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gangsta+Pat">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
