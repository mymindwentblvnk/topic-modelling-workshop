Colossal riffage from antwerp

In recent years, Belgium has earned a reputation as a fertile breeding ground for talented sludge/stoner metal bands. Antwerp-based Your Highness is next in a long line of promising newcomers in the genre. Early 2015 the quintet switched into high gear with the release of ‘City in Ruins’. Their second full-length effort is a strong statement and the follow-up to their 2011 debut ‘Cults ‘n’ Cunts’. Your Highness came out on top in a recent Pukkelpop poll in a Belgian newspaper but it’s GMM that will experience the full force of the live cyclone known as Your Highness.
