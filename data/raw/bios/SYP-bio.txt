Started back in 2005, the norwegian band Syp consists of guitarist Kristian Enersen, lead singer / piano /keyboardist Sverre Aagaard, guitarist and backup singer Geir Bergersen Huse, drummer Jørgen Nedogedell and bass player Fredrik Sætre. The focal point of their musical ideology would probably best be described as a mix between glitter fantasies from the 70s, smoky german theatre from the 30s, tacky japanese fashion and idiosyncronic deillusions of a rock and roll depraved ex-con trapped on an island with only women, sand and herbal tea. People have been known to get offended by the bands blatant sexual innuendo and outlandish costumes.
