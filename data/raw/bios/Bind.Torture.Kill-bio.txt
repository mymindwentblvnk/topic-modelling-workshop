One of them is Industrial Metal from San Antonio,TX
---
BTK incorporates the talents of four performers that, due to their deranged and maniacal desires, assembles together to engage the masses with hard hitting Industrial audio hatred. Kreep unleashes his inner demons by producing
viciously melodic and satanically symphonic synths, beats, and vocals. Spooky awakens the dead on rhythm guitars for that gritty bloody sound. Gustav Sin annihilates your ear drums on lead guitar with his diabolical and sadistic shreds. While Skandal summons his aggression on keys for a show that is morbid, ravenous, and delightfully sinister. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bind.Torture.Kill">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
