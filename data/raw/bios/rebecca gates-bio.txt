Rebecca Gates is a musician, curator and audio editor who began playing music in the Pacific NW DIY indie culture scene as a member of The Spinanes. After 5 years of recording as The Spinanes, Gates released 2001’s Ruby Series which Spin called “a warm, thoughtful, and melodically gorgeous record.” 

Since that time she has appeared on records by Laetitia Sadier, Ted Leo, The Mekons, The Decemberists, The Minus Five and Willie Nelson + many more. Gates is preparing two albums for release in 2011.

Gates was editor and co-founder of The Relay Project audiomagazine, a sound-only periodical featuring content from a variety of editorial and sonic sources which will be re-launched in 2011 as Sonoset Magazine. A co-curator of The Marfa Sessions, an exhibition of sonic land arts installations by international artists in Marfa, Texas, she has also been featured as an artist at Lehmann Maupin Gallery (New York, NY), Vedanta/Kavi Gupta Gallery (Chicago, IL), Centro La Fontana (Barcelona, SPAIN), Fontanelle (Portland, OR) and The Sun Valley Center for the Arts (Sun Valley, ID/Los Angeles, CA). 
 
“Whether folding Memphis R&B into slacker bedroom laments or post-rock abstractions into catchy pop, she nails the ennui of lovesick transitions and physical displacements with a marksman's aim. And she might just possess the sexiest voice in rock.” – Entertainment Weekly

There’s nothing contrived about her genuine ability to balance love and lust on the striking "Lure and Cast." Gates' newfound depth as a singer and arranger is evident on the sadly soulful "Doos," the reflective, set-ending "The Seldom Scene" and "The Colonel's Circle." - Billboard
