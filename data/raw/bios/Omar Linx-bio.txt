Emerging artist Omar LinX has been perfecting his craft since the age of 15, but only recently felt it was time to drop his first mixtape “A Cold Welcome,” and has hit the ground running. In only a short period of time LinX  has proven that he is at the forefront of Toronto hip hop. In the past year he has collaborated with local Toronto talent, as well as established heavy hitters, like Royce Da 5’9" and Joell Ortiz. His rugged voice and sharp tongued lyrics, laced with wit, biting humor and clever wordplay, are complemented by smooth, melodic hooks. Candid and passionate descriptions of his life are seamlessly paralleled by imaginative concepts, make him a compelling artist to listen to and give his music a distinctly unique quality. Not one to box himself in, Omar has made it a point to experiment with different genres. His latest collaborations with fellow Toronto artists Zeds Dead, notably “Wake up” and “Out for Blood,” have captivated the attention of many and received a great deal of support from hip hop and dubstep/DnB lovers alike. Their most recent creation, Out for Blood, has excited listeners, getting him heavy rotation and international praise. His fan base continues to grow as his music reaches an increasingly wider audience. His next project, “City of Ommz”, will be released early 2011, and based on what he’s demonstrated so far, it will undoubtedly push the envelope of convention and whisk listeners right into the middle of the elusive world in which he seems to thrive.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Omar+Linx">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
