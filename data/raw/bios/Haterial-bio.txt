Rough and tough from Northern Finland!! Haterial was formed in March 2010 and Eki joined to complete the equation the next month. With the similar desires in music and urge to create something that would reflect our idea of how things should be done it was easy to proceed. Songs started pouring out, like they still do. The result was something that we feel the music should sound like for us; variations in speed, melodies and vocals with only few simple principles in mind: We do what we wanna do, to hell with genres! Everything we do must be fun from the beginning till the end, no matter what. And last but not least: Every fucking song must make YOUR head nod, one way or the other! Hope you enjoy, because we definitely do. --Haterial
