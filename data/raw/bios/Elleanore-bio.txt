In 2000 the formation Elleanore sees the first ray of light. This band exposes all components needed to form a proper symphonic metal band. These components consist of power/quiescent and a touch of groove. Apart from their self-made style, foreign influences are present as well. All daily expiriences inspired this band.

But after the vocalist Joyce left the band, it started to go downwards. The band held auditions to keep the spirit going, but eventually anounced they'd pull the plug in August 2007.

The song "The Silence Within" is was mixed and mastered by Stefan Helleblad, who was also one of the producers of Within Temptations "The Silent Force" and the song "Mein Teil" of Rammstein.

Joyce Dijkgraaf is also known of Marcel Coenens' 2nd solo album Coulor Journey and is a student at the Herman Brood academy in Utrecht.

The music consisted of everyday happenings which gives people a chance to identify themselves to their music.

Their Lineup consisted of:

Joyce Dijkgraaf – Vocals
Daviid Guiterez Rojas – Keys
Jan Haumont – Guitar
Danny da Costa – Guitar
Maurce Brouwens – Bass
Angelo da Costa – Drums
