TaunTaun -
Former Gamits helmsman Chris Fogal has always been a secret shredder, and here he finally indulges his inner Hessian. With the help of a superstar lineup, Fogal has taken local metal to breathtaking new heights, with mountain-crumbling rhythms, Guitar Hero-worthy leads and searing, monolithic vocals. â€” Dave Herrera, Westword 12/08.

TaunTaun -
When looking at a disassembled car engine, it may seem improbable that all those tiny pieces of scrap metal could one day be constructed into something powerful. The same can be said looking at the pieces of TaunTaun.
With acts such as the Gamits, Rocky Votolato, Sleeper Horse and Uphollow under the members' collective belt, it's hard to imagine a finished product that could be heavy and powerful, but it is.
The album blends soaring guitar solos, double-bass drum blasts and enough Black Sabbath-style shredding to shame Ozzy into drinking again.
The way it's put together may seem unorthodox, but TaunTaun has constructed a beautifully brutal masterpiece that should be considered among the top local releases of the year.
