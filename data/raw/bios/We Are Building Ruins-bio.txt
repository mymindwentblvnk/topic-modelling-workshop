We Are Building Ruins is an italian modern death metal/grindcore band from Cagliari, Sardinia (Italy).

The band started out in 2008 from an idea of the guitarist Nicola Olla (ex-Mutilated Soul, ex Sanisickation): he wanted to start a fresh death metal project; a few months later Raphael Saini (Chaoswave, Corpsefuckingart, ex-Misbelieving) joined the project.

2008 was a really difficult year for the band: many line-up changes and too many problems to deal with. Even dealing with problems Raphael and Nicola never stopped to practice and compose songs.

2009: The band found a valuable member: Omar Mameli (ex-Catar√¨a) joined WABR as lead singer.

June 14th, 2010: The band digitally releases the ep "Where the sun sets". The tracks have been recorded at V-Studio (Sinnai, Italy) by Villy Cocco, and mixed/mastered at 16th Cellar Studio (Rome, Italy) by Stefano Morabito. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/We+Are+Building+Ruins">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
