PICTURE OF THE MOON started in 2001 as a group of music playing students of the University of Twente, The Netherlands with a similar taste in progressive rock and metal. The band formed in the two following years and the line up stabilized in 2003.

In 2004 the band decided to record a demo called Waxing Crescent which contains the very first compositions they ever made. After two years of writing songs and doing small gigs the band decided to make a professional production that would describe the band's current direction and sound.

The second EP that resulted from these recordings is called Ageless Day and is produced by Joost van den Broek (AFTER FOREVER). It will be released on June, 1st 2007 through Dark Balance Records. The EP has been recorded in the famous Excess Studios in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. Stylewise PICTURE OF THE MOON can be described as progressive rock and metal; think of a mix between THRESHOLD and RIVERSIDE. With their music PICTURE OF THE MOON already impressed the club scene in The Netherlands by making it up to the semi-finals of the Metal Battle competition 2006.

Due to high demands of his study program lead guitarist Sjoerd Kolk decided to quit Picture of the Moon just after the recording of Ageless Day. Conservatory grad and guitar virtuoso Alex Rosenhof replaced him in early spring 2007.

In 2007 POTM will appear on several festivals and in many clubs. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Picture+of+the+Moon">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
