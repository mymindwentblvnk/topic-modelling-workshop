The Paralydium Project is an epic-progressive metal project founded by John Berg in 2015. Their deliverance of melodic, technical and powerful songs takes you through space and time for an experience beyond borders. With influences from bands such as Symphony X, Dream Theater, Pagan's Mind etc, TPP has created their own significant sound, combining elements from the prog-metal elite into a best of both worlds sound.
The Paralydium Project EP was released in October 2015 and has set new grounds into the world of progressive metal. It is a definite "must have" for anyone who are into this kind of music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Paralydium+Project">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
