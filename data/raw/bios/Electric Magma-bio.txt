Electric Magma formed in 2000 in the tiny hamlet known as Toronto, Canada. Emerging from the ashes of previous musical endeavors, the thunderous trio comprised of Tryg Smith , Tim Reesor forged ahead with their vision of sonic eruption. Halfway up the fuzzed-out sludge ladder, somewhere in between the metal boogie rock of Clutch and the surfed-up stoner rock of Fu Manchu, lies the sound of burning liquid rock. Electrified Magma.

While many groups struggle with the concept of applying vocal melodies over their musical groove, Electric Magma opted to side-step this dilemma and simply forgo the vocals and in their place drop in double the riffs. While the lack of a singer can be a crippling obstacle for many a lesser band, it has only added fuel to their collective fire and driven their fuzzed-out riff rock into another dimension.

Notorious merch whores, Electric Magma are second only to KISS when it comes to pimping the name onto anything and everything…soup to nuts, condoms to candy bars…their merch table alone is often an event unto itself, representing a bigger spread than Grandma’s baked goods table at the local church bazaar.

Currently promoting the release of their latest album entitled “Mudshovel”, which was released in April 2009, Electric Magma barrel ahead like a runaway freight train. This latest record may in fact be every stoner rock fans wet dream as they have created the ultimate sing-along for psychopaths and hard rocking maniacs. It’s riff rock karaoke night at the Sirloin Saloon, so grab your beer and belt buckle and give it your best.
