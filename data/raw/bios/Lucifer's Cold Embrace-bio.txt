Handling back-up vocals and half the guitar- and songwriting in Dutch band Non-Divine since he was seventeen, Martin van Beek has called the metal scene his home for well over a decade. Still, that band isn't the place for blast beats. So, sharing his girlfriend's love for bands like Naglfar and Dissection, he set out to write some songs for her. Engulfed by diabolical inspiration, the project grew into something more than he had initially intended. Hell-bent on making this music his finest yet, he spent the better part of a year perfecting the five brand new songs and making sure they were recorded, mixed and mastered to the best of his abilities. The result was the EP 'Sovereign Heresy', which was lauded by many websites as 'black metal done right'. Now, two years later, the first full-length album 'The Elegy of Lilith' has been released. Longer, harder, more complex, and featuring the haunting sounds of an entire orchestra, this behemoth of a project is by far Martin's most ambitious. The sulphurous steel hammered down November 30th.
