Pascal Rogé is a French pianist who was born in Paris on April 6, 1951. His playing exemplifies the elegance and subtlety said to distinguish French pianism, in his interpretation of the works of compatriot composers Saint-Saëns, Fauré, Debussy, Ravel, Satie, and Poulenc, among others. However, his repertoire also covers the masters Haydn, Mozart, Brahms, and Beethoven. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Pascal+Rog%C3%A9">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
