Eye Rhyme is a band with musical diversity and delivers another interesting chapter in Canadian music. Eye Rhyme is an amalgamation of sounds and styles from Rush, Queensryche, King's X and even a bit of Dream Theater. But even compared with these fellow artists, the Eye Rhyme sound is unique as can be notably heard in Ian Graham's vocals and bass, John Butcher's melodic and intricate guitar playing to Cody Willem's articulate drumming. Eye Rhyme has 2 albums currently. "Life Control" is a concept album that features guest guitarist Ian Crichton of Saga and Steve Shelski of Coney Hatch. The"Soul" returns back to song oriented writing rather then concept album like Eye Rhyme's first album "Life Control". From the opening track of "Electricity", based on conflicts in relationships, the hard rock riffs in "Surface" dealing with racism, to "Dying Hope", a song based on Robert Latimer's euthanasia court case that gives the viewpoint of extreme illness from his daughter Tracy's side. But there is also beauty in the flowing sound textures and melodies of "Distant Light" and quirkiness with the time signature changing, cool riffs of "Spaceman Serenade" that pays tribute to kids wanting to become astronauts. "Soul" and "Life Control" have been re-mastered for a more modern sound that will keep fans engaged. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Eye+Rhyme">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
