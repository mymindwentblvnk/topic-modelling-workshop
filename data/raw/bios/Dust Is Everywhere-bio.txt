Dust Is Everywhere is an American Black Metal band based in Pennsylvania.  Taking their musical cues from Gorgoroth, Sargeist, King Diamond, and older Mayhem, Dark Funeral, and Behemoth, they play suffocatingly atmospheric metal suffused with themes of horror and darkness.  Their 2007 album, "Attics and Catacombs" was the flagship release of Matt Moore's Creeping Vine Productions label. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dust+Is+Everywhere">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
