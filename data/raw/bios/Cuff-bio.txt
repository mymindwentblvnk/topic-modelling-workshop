2. CUFF started after Oshawa deathgrind Necromatory broke up. Zach Smith and Fat Bob wanted something to keep themselves occupied with, little did they know the brutality they would unleash.

CUFF started out as an internet goregrind/pornogrind style band with hilarious samples and joke titles about about getting stoned and retards. They have slowly evolved into their newest released, Universal Punishment, an experimental deathgrind project unlike anything they have ever released and sure to be their most brutal, slamming album yet.
