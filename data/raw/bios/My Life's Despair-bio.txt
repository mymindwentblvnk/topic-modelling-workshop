My Life's Despair is an American Gothic Doom Metal band from  Southern California .  

My Life's Despair was conceived in 1994 by Larshus. His primary instrument is drums. After spending a year playing drums with the melodic death metal band Mourning and the eventual demise of the band, he had decided to continue on in the same vane as Mourning and started to learn other instruments to record as a solo project. Larshus felt most other musicians in the metal realm were not interested in writing down tempo music that strayed out of the classical metal formula.

Larshus continued to play drums and tour with numerous other bands for the next 10 plus years.
