Blue Giant is a country and folk-influenced five-piece from Portland, Oregon. Formed in 2008, the lineup consists of Kevin and Anita Robinson (of Viva Voce), Evan Railton (formerly of Swords), Jesse Bates, and Dave Depper (of Norfolk & Western and Blanket Music). The latter two replaced former members Seth Lorinczi and Chris Funk (of The Decemberists) who departed in the time leading up to their 2010 tour. Their first release, an EP entitled Target Heart, was released in 2009 through Amore!Phonics on CD/Digital, and Jealous Butcher on 12" vinyl, the latter of which containing two bonus tracks. They have recently announced signing to Vanguard Records, and plan to release a full length on July 13th, 2010, although the title has yet to be announced. They are currently embarking on a nationwide tour.
