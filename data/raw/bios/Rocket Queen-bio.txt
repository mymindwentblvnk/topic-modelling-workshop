Rocket Queen first came to be when a bunch of Melbourne girls, with a love of all things rock n’ roll, decided that if boys could play, they could too. So the two eldest Freeland sisters, Clea and Ailie, formed a band with old school friend Anna...but it was only when the youngest Freeland sister, Fleur, picked up the bass that the band really took shape and Rocket Queen was born. With diverse musical influences, Rocket Queen exuberate a unique blend of sounds that’s a little bit country & blues, a touch of pop and a whole lotta rock & roll. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rocket+Queen">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
