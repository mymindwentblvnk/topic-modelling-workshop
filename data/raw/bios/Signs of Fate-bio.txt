Signs of Fate is a Canadian power metal band that was founded in 2003, by bassist composer Pascal Lacombe (who is currently also playing bass for another Quebec City Power Metal band called Sudden Flames). The first line-up of members he recruited then, only lasted a few months. Nevertheless, Pascal kept on working on his own material, and up to now, he has completed music and lyrics on 9 songs.
 
This time, in 2007, Pascal was able to recruit a more determined line-up of experienced and motivated musicians, in order to bring his own material within a solid band setting, amongst the lively and excellent Power Metal Scene from Quebec City. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Signs+of+Fate">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
