Mournful was a band of four musicians from Bottrop, Germany.
It was founded in 1997 as a quartet which combined such different kinds of music as Muse, Radiohead, Cave-In or Dredg.

2002 they published their first EP named Light Harvesting Complex.
The sweet melodies, sung by a subtle yet powerful voice could easily inspire a lot of fans.
Encouraged by the success and the positive resonance of the EP the guys created the album Monochrome which was released in 2003.
On that record their style was even more concise and conscient.
After the release they went back to the studio, concentraded on both live shows and the new album which was planned for 2005.
Despite to the hopes of their fans the new album never came - even though the tracks were finished there were too many conflicts in the band to publish a new record.
