Che Noir is a Buffalo, New York-based emcee and producer who delivers strong, uncompromisingly direct lyrics over production inspired by mid-'90s East Coast rap. Albums such as 2020's As God Intended (with Apollo Brown) demonstrate her range of styles and techniques, from nostalgic reminiscences to crime-driven narratives.

Marche Lashawn was born in Buffalo in 1994, and grew up listening to rappers like Foxy Brown, Jay-Z, and the Notorious B.I.G. A friend taught her how to make beats while she was in high school, and she started rapping soon afterward. She began taking music seriously when she was 21, building recording studios in Buffalo and Niagara Falls to work on her first songs, and releasing her debut mixtape, Poetic Thoughts, in 2016. After connecting with the storied Griselda Records crew, she recorded the track "Tyson" with Benny the Butcher in 2017. She also began working with Rochester-based rapper/producer 38 Spesh, appearing on his 2018 Kool G Rap collaboration (Son of G Rap) as well as his solo releases. 38 Spesh produced Noir's 2018 release The Thrill of the Hunt and its 2019 sequel, as well as 2020's Juno. She worked with Detroit producer Apollo Brown on her second album of 2020, As God Intended, which was issued by Mello Music Group and included guest appearances by Black Thought (the Roots), Skyzoo, and Planet Asia. ~ Paul Simpson, Rovi <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Che+Noir">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
