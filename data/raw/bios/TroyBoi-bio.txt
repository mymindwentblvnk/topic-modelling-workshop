TroyBoi, real name Troy Henry, is a electronic music producer from South East London born 1987. He got his start making his beats standing up in his kitchen, in his studio apartment on his Mac Book and a midi keyboard. This multi-talented musician specializes in extraordinarily unique, versatile, and highly musical tracks that fuses various textures from multiple genres. TroyBoi is without a doubt one of the top up-and-coming producers in the game right now and it's quite clear from his composition that his influences are vast indeed. He has already produced tracks with some very high profile artists and his collaboration with Flosstradamus 'Soundclash' is arguably one of the biggest anthems in the scene today. His style is undeniably his own, infectious to the ears and beyond stimulating to the mind. He is also one half of the Producer/DJ duo SoundSnobz with one of his best friends, icekream. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/TroyBoi">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
