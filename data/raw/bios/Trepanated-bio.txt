Trepanated is a danish band, formed in the summer of 2008.
Being a band still in its experimental phase, it's difficult to pin-point an exact genre to the band. 
However an undeniable influence from danish bands such as Hatesphere, Illdisposed and As We fight is clear, making it part death, part thrash, part a few metalcore-references, and also some grind now and then.
Trepanated's "genre-sound" has also been compared to At The Gates'.

The line-up for the band is at this point the following:

Daniel  - Vocals

Andreas  - Bass

Mathias "Tudse" - Lead Guitar

Jesper "Jytte" - Rhythm Guitar
