SPYAIR is a Japanese rock band that formed in Nagoya, Japan in 2005. The group started out doing "street live" performances in their hometown "Sakae Park" in Nagoya. Originally, the band had zero listeners, before it began to gradually build its following. The band major-debuted under the Sony Music Japan label in 2010 and performed for the first time at the prestigious Nippon Budokan in 2012. They are known for their "positive" songs. Since their debut, SPYAIR has picked up international fans all around the world by recording numerous theme songs for anime, most notably Gintama and Haikyuu!! Their songs have also been used as tie-up themes for other media such as film, game, and television drama. 

On December 22, 2015, SPYAIR vocalist IKE announced at the end of a show at Saitama Super Arena during the band's "DYNAMITE" arena tour that the band's next major goal would be to reconvene 4 years later for another "DYNAMITE" event to be held, at that time, at the Tokyo Dome.
