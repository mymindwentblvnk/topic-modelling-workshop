George Fitzgerald first appeared on our radar with his "Don't You" cut on Scuba's Sub:stance mix. Fast-forward a year and he's got his first release on Hotflush, dropping the future garage soul of "The Let Down" and a luscious dubtech gem in "Weakness". It's hard to escape the fact that both sides strongly remind of Joy Orbison, but that's a really obvious comparison to make considering that he's got tunes lined up for release on Doldrums. The pair simply share a keen sense of garage & house-warmed melody and a thing for clipped 2-step patterns with big bottom end. If you're into Instra:mental, Mount Kimbie, James Blake or Joy Orbison, you could do a lot worse than this. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/George+Fitzgerald">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
