Ironsword is a Heavy Metal band from Lisbon, Portugal. The band was formed in early 1995 by J.M. (Jo√£o Fonseca), who then played all instruments, except for the drums. A drum machine had to be used since at first he couldn't find decent musicians for his band. He used 4 tracker to record a 15 minute promo-tape which featured 3 songs, and this was the first release by the band.

Since then the band has released three studio albums, Ironsword in 2002, Return of the Warrior in 2004 and Overlords of Chaos in 2008.

J.M. no longer plays all instruments. Instead he's the singer and guitarist, Arrno Maalm (Beto Arrais) is the drummer, and Rick Thor is the bass player. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ironsword">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
