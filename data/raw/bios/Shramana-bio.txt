Shramana is a heavy, melodic band that plays mournful lamentations of a world determined to kill its mother. The group hails from the quiet yet culturally booming town of Missoula, MT. Founded by Reggie Herbert in 2009 as an attempt to learn how to play the guitar as well as the bass, the project morphed genres from easy-as-pie hard punk rock to crushing post-metal, echoing the stylings of Neurosis, Isis and Fall of Efrafa. Shramana attempts to sonically answer personal and collective questions regarding contemporary society's relationship to nature.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Shramana">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
