Crumbsuckers was an American crossover thrash band from 1982 to 1990, formed in Nassau County, New York. Their style was one of the first to mix heavy metal and hardcore punk, making an impact on the wider scene with their 1986 debut album, Life of Dreams.

Though the band was supported by its fans and fellow artists, Crumbsuckers second album, Beast on My Back, failed to deliver on expectations, despite the musicianship displayed on the recording. The departure of lead vocalist Chris Notaro in 1988 started the band's gradual decline. Members went on to form Pro-Pain.

Crumbsuckers played its latest reunion show at the 2015 Black N' Blue Bowl Festival at Webster Hall (formerly the Ritz) in New York City. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Crumbsuckers">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
