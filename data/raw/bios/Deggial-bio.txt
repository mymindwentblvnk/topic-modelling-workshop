The sickening fury dates back to 2003. After some needed changes in both in the line-up and band name, Deggial rose unto HIS feet in 2007. After the infamously devilish TKM Deathsquad split, the band had to remain silent due to shitload of reasons. But now THE BEAST awakens with a wrath that is invulnerable neither by man, nor any form of holy deity!!! Deggial, along with the forces of TKM will not show any compassion upon anyone on HIS path.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Deggial">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
