Toksostoma are Andrzej Olszewski (vocals, bass), Robert Wysocki (guitar) and Tomasz Grabowski (drums, lyrics) - all from Warsaw, Poland. They play a combination of black metal and thrash metal, citing bands like Sodom, Kreator, Destruction, Venom and Aura Noir as their main influences. Tomasz put the project together in 2008 after an extended down time due to a car accident in 2007. A member of a former unnamed death metal project he was involved with accidentally hit him after they were done rehearsing while he was driving drunk. One of Tomasz' legs was badly hurt in the accident and he was furious because he was unable to play the drums for months. This eventually lead to the split up of the members involved. Andrzej joined the remaining members around August 2008 and they decided to start a thrash/black project which eventually turned into Toksostoma. The name of the band is a pun - it refers to the Latin name of a genus of bird called "toxostoma" which is commonly referred to as "thrashers" in the English language. This also happens to be a nick name for thrash metal fans. This is why they use birds in their graphical art in the band logo and on the cover of the release. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Toksostoma">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
