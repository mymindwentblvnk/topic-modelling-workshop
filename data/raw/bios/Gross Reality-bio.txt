Gross Reality's inception began in 1991, when Daniel Powell and Jason Wheeler met and bonded over the love of thrash metal. After several line up changes, the classic GROSS REALITY gathering was formed: DANIEL POWELL, JASON WHEELER, ROLAND ARTHUR, and SHAWN McCOY. The band thrashed the Carolinas until 1996, sharing the stage with national acts such as Type 0 Negative, Cannibal Corpse, Deicide, Bolt Thrower, Unleashed and Confessor. Fast forward to 2009, the new Thrash invasion was starting to gear up. Once again, the fellas answered the call and GROSS REALITY was reborn! This time sharing the stage with National acts: Death Angel, Evile, and Bonded By Blood. In 2013 GROSS REALITY recorded a full length album entitled "OVERTHROW" which has been picked up by DIVEBOMB records and is scheduled for release in May of 2014! New shredder, Taylor Veraldi, has recently joined the mix, replacing classic guitarist Shawn McCoy. We are currently writing new material for the next album... stay tuned and THRASH HARD!!
