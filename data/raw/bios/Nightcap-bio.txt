1) An experimental rock band from Ypsilanti, MI. Nightcap's primary lineup is David Zayas (vocals), Graham Rockwood (bass), Andrew Brengle (drums) and Brett Cimbalik (guitar/electronics). Due to their varied musical interests, live shows are entirely unique and often free form. Nightcap also has a revolving door of "guest characters", which feature instrumentation as diverse as sitar, theramin and saxophone.

Nightcap recorded a three track holiday-EP of contemporary covers for friends in 2007 titled "A Nightcap Christmas". Recorded during the Summer and Autumn of 2008, Nightcap have finished their first full length "A Magical Device." More information at www.myspace.com/nightcapbag

2) Portland, OR Mix DJ.  Last.fm user: wikk!d.

3) Progressive folk rock band from Trondheim, Norway. Inspired by the 70's prog rock bands, and especially Jethro Tull. Mainly with acoustic guitars and soothing vocals (as well as piano, violin and cello) they spellbound the audience with folklore stories dressed in stunning music. 
They released an self titled EP and recorded a full album. But sadly the album never got released, and the band have been on ice for the last 4-6 years. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nightcap">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
