Clairvoya was a metal band from Mandal, Norway. Clairvoya was one of the first bands of Oddleif Stensland. They released a demo EP called "Electric Sun" in 1996. This EP was self-financed and printed in a very limited amount. It only contained two songs ("Tale of Arion" and "Electric Sun").

The band split up after a couple of years, but Oddleif Stensland and Erik Mortensen continued their work together in Ingermanland. Ingermanland later reformed and is known today as Communic. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Clairvoya">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
