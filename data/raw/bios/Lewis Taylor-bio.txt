Lewis Taylor is an eclectric artist and multi-instrumental who writes, produces and plays every instrument on his own material. He is instantly recognisable by his trademark sweet sounding soulful voice, which is often accompanied, and perfectly complemented, by multi-layered vocal harmonies, soaring rock guitar solos and unique production and arrangements. Influenced in equal parts by Todd Rundgren, Scott Walker, Prince, Jimi Hendrix, Marvin Gaye, The Beach Boys and Yes, his music has been described as 'psychedelic soul in the broadest sense'. Praised by the likes of David Bowie, Elton John, D'Angelo, Chaka Khan, Darryl Hall, Aaliyah, Pharrell, Questlove and Leon Ware he still remains the best kept secret of British soul.
