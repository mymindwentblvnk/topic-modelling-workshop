In spring 2008, Chris Dalisda (guitar) and Beni Eichenseer (drums) had the idea to found a band. After a long search for other members they finally recruited another guitar player ([[bandmember from=2008]Toby Bierhoff), a vocalist (Chris Hamberger aka Hamby) and last but not least a bassist (Philipp Hauck aka Korny). The basic idea was to create grooving death metal and combine it with social criticism which is shown in it's texts. In summer 2008 the band found a place for rehearsals at Germering JUZ II. After brutal discussions about the band's name, the founding members and the vocalist decided at holidays at the austrian Wolfgangsee, to choose the name Public Grave which combined death and public, what was the basic idea. Later the band decided to leave JUZ II ,because of circumstances which i don..t want to discuss right now, and moved into the Bike and Music Ranch @ TÃ¼rkenfeld. We..ll see what future hold..s ready for us, and I hope many will join us, well We..ll see about that!^^
