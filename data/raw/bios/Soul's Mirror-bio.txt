Born in 2006, after a few personnel changes, Soul’s Mirror find a stable line-up composed of: Stefano Dell’Ava (vocals), Marco Trazzi (bass guitar), Yuval Sharon (drums), Elias Eiholzer (guitars) and Luca Magri (guitars).

Beginning in 2006 on through June 2007 the band plays live performances throughout the entire Ticino and Lombardy, gaining excellent audience recognition. During the summer of the same year, the group produces a first self-titled promotional album, comprised of five tracks, which permits them to find further concert spots and to reach second place in the musical competition designed for emerging bands, “Palco ai Giovani” (stage to the young). 

Again thanks to the CD they receive good reviews and further concert spots. The band is now looking for concerts in Switzerland and is composing new songs that will be presented on the first LP, predicted to be released in June 2009. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Soul%27s+Mirror">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
