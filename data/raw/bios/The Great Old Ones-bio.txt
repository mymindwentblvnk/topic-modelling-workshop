The Great Old Ones is an atmospheric black metal band that emerged from Bordeaux, France in 2009. Their lyrics draw heavily on the literature of H. P. Lovecraft's Chthulu Mythos and related literature, and the band's name refers to the elder deities in this mythos. They have released three full-length albums to date. Their most recent album, EOD: A Tale Of Dark Legacy, was released on January 27, 2017 through Season of Mist Records, and was conceived of by the band as a sequel to Lovecraft's book 'The Shadow Over Innsmouth'. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Great+Old+Ones">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
