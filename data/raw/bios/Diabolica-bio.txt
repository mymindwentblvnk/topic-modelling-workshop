2) Diabolica (?) was founded in 1999 with four members including singer/guitarist Harri Ahola, drummer Jarmo Kalilainen, guitarist Mikko hämäläinen and bassist Pasi Hämäläinen.
Starting with old classic songs from heavy metal legends like Iron Maiden and Judas Priest, they performed on various Stages around their city gathering experience.
Pasi Hämäläinen quit the bänd in 2002 and a few months later he was replaced by Tapio Helin. With this lineup they entered a band contest and won it! They recorded their first demo in Cursed studios in 2002.
Pasi Hämäläinen came back to the band after Tapio Helin quit. With this lineup they recorded their second demo "Broken" and a live DVD called "Alive in Tuusula". Didn't take very long until Pasi Hämäläinen wuit the band again. After that there was a long search going on for a new bassist.
Finally Diabolica hired Janne Palonen to play the bass. That lineup is still valid through this day. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Diabolica">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
