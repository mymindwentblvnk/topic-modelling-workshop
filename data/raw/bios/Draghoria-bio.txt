Draghoria is a multi-generational thrash metal band from Colorado USA formed in 2013. After several line-up changes, they released their debut album ‘Portal To Extinction’ in 2016. The band's original singer then left, and Draghoria released three songs from their debut album in 2017 with the new vocalist, Riggs. This release was the E.P. ‘Portal To Extinction'. A second three-song E.P. ‘Thrash A.D.’ was released in 2019. During the Covid outbreak, Draghoria hunkered down and put together a fitting theme-based album entitled 'Dangerous Species' showcasing a matured songwriting approach focusing on the current state of the world and the United States in General. The current line-up includes Riggs (Ex-Sault, Arcanium, & One-Eyed Doll) on vocals, Ron Carrillo (Ex-Mandrake) on lead guitar, John Colucco (Ex-(Internal Bleeding) on bass, Alex Carrillo on drums, and Ryan Nevins on the second guitar. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Draghoria">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
