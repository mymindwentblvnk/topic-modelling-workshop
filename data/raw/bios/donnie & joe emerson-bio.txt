Donnie and Joe Emerson are an American vocal and instrumental duo consisting of brothers Donnie Emerson and Joe Emerson.

Living on a family farm in rural Fruitland, Washington, in the late 1970's, the brothers' father, Don Emerson, Sr., encouraged his teenage sons' musical interest as they began writing and playing their own music. Don, Sr. built his sons a state-of-the-art $100,000 recording studio and in it they self-produced and self-released their first album Dreamin' Wild in 1979, an eclectic mix of rock, soul, R&B, country and funk music, on their own Enterprise & Co. label.

The record had no commercial success until 2008 when record collector Jack Fleisher discovered the record in an antique shop in Spokane, Washington. Fleisher began to evangelize it. In July 2012 Ariel Pink covered the song Baby and in the same year Light in the Attic Records re-released Dreamin' Wild with Baby becoming an underground hit.

In the 18 months the Emerson brothers spent in their farm studio they wrote and recorded around 70 songs. As a result, they followed up the reissue of Dreamin' Wild with the 2014 release Still Dreamin' Wild: The Lost Recordings 1979-81. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Donnie+&+Joe+Emerson">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
