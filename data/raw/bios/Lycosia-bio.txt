Finally, the self-proclaimed “Glam-Goth-Deluxe” Parisian rock combo is back! Lycosia will soon be celebrating its tenth year of existence with the international release of Apokalipstik, their brand new fourth album. 

After the release of their first two albums in France – No Love Lost and Unisex, both produced by Kit Woolven (Anathema, Cradle of Filth, Cathedral) – the arrival of their third record – L Y C O S I A – in 2005 confirmed the hopes of their worldwide fans and critics. 

Ten years of relentless work have produced dramatic results: if Lycosia’s third album made headlines for its intense tracks and stellar production quality, Apokalipstik will smash the world apart with its rocking choruses and killer tunes! Apokalipstik will blow your head off with a modern musical crossover between true glitter and sexy electronic-post-industrial-dark sound, with a nasty goth & roll touch… A Glam-Goth-Deluxe Apocalypse! 

There’s no filler; every track is a hit. 

While the stylistic range of Lycosia continues to expand, their sound remains solid and coherent. The feel of sensual rock with no concessions throughout Apokalipstik is reminiscent of Lycosia’s original and powerful style, which has won over night creatures of the dark scene, metal lovers, and freaks from the underground alike. The potential of Apokalipstik is tremendous and will confirm the band once more as a modern institution of the goth rock scene. 

Beware... Lycosia has arisen again!  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lycosia">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
