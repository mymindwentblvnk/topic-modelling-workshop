Phalloplasty is a one man Brutal Death Metal band that features elements of Slam, Pornogrind, and Goregrind. Although the first split release was straight Pornogrind his sound matured over time becoming more and more brutal and eventually evolving into the one man machine of guttural brutality you see before you. He is currently recording his full length debut entitled "Necrophagic Funeral Ritual" that will hopefully be out either by the end of 2011 or the beginning of 2012. A free 2 song demo of the album is available on this page.
