Anachronism is a Death Metal band from Switzerland, formed in July 2009 by Lisa Voisard handling the lead and rhythm  guitar duties, Matthieu Favre as vocalist and Florent Duployer on the drums.
In May 2012, the band recorded its first 3-track demo and in January 2012, Nicolas Riderer reinforced the current formation by joining the band as the bassist.In June 2012, Nicolas decided to stop playing the bass and to add a second guitar to the band, which increased the possibilities for the band. The bass duties were later handed over to Florian in September of the same year.
The band released its first full-length album in October 2012, called Senseless. The band released a 6 track EP, "Reflecting The Inside" in 2015.
Always looking further, the style of the band evolves toward an increasingly violent and technical style of Death Metal. The lyrics are concerned mainly with human nature and social issues. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Anachronism">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
