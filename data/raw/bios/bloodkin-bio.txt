Daniel Hutchens and Eric Carter met each other when they were eight years old. After high school, they started getting serious about their blossoming songwriting partnership. The road eventually led them to Athens, GA, which soon came to be a permanent home. They continued to concentrate on their songwriting, and by the early 90's they had a catalogue of over 300 compositions. By this time Hutchens and Carter had given their musical collaboration a "band name": Bloodkin.

People started to notice, and some even started covering some Bloodkin compositions; most notably Widespread Panic, who wound up recording three Bloodkin songs, and who continue to play those and other Bloodkin songs live. Panic's cover of "Can't Get High" peaked at 27 on the Billboard AOR charts. Daniel also wound up playing with ex-Velvet Underground member Moe Tucker in the early-to-mid 90's; he played on three of her albums and several of her tours.

In 1994 Bloodkin released their first official CD, GOOD LUCK CHARM. The project was produced by Johnny Sandlin (legendary producer of the Allman Brothers, Eddie Hinton, and so many others). Bloodkin recording projects over the years have also featured producers John Keane (R.E.M, Cowboy Junkies, etc.), and, more often than any other producer, David Barbe (Sugar, Son Volt, Drive By Truckers, etc.).
