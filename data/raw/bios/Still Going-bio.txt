Still Going Bio:

Still Going is the sublime partnership of composer/producer Liv Spencer & producer Eric Duncan. Their talents originally collided on the now classic single “Still Going Theme” (DFA Records). Along with its hypnotic flipside “On & On”, the single captivated listeners with it’s anthemic energy and quickly became a dance floor staple. Their second release “Spaghetti Circus” (DFA Records) propelled Still Going beyond the synthesized house and techno sound in the form of a guitar-fueled charging disco anthem. The EP’s B side – “Untitled Love” – became a balearic anthem in its own right, and cemented their reputation for creating timeless dance music.
Considering their musical history, this came as no surprise.

Liv Spencer, the composer and performer behind Still Going’s music counts a number of classic dancefloor anthems under his belt. The talent behind the timeless melodies of Spaghetti Circus and Still Going also produces and writes for House of House, who released the massive ‘Rushing to Paradise EP’ on cult NYC label Whatever We Want Records.

Eric “Dr Dunks” Duncan is one half of legendary duo Rub-n-Tug. Who in the words of ID magazine; singled handedly ‘re-invigorated New York night life’ with their infamous Campire club night and roadblock parties around the city. Having built their reputation as masters of “disco theatre” they were soon requested to DJ all over the world and have remixed the likes of the Beastie Boys, LCD Soundsystem, Roxy Music and Coldplay to name but a few.

Still Going have built a solid reputation as remixers and lent their talents to artists such as The Doves, !!! (Chk, Chk, Chk), Groove Armada, Austra, The Presets, and Bryan Ferry amongst others.

In 2012, the NYC duo steps up their game with the launch of Still Going Records. Their first release. “D117″, is an epic blend of psychedelic rock’n'roll, disco, and house music. The label will showcase original Still Going material as well as releases from new and established NYC talent. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Still+Going">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
