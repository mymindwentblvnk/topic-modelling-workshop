When people reflect on the Floridian metal scene of the late ’80s, groups like DEATH, OBITUARY and MASSACRE instantly spring to mind. Yet, there’s one band that despite never achieving the same glory some of their contemporaries enjoyed is still adored and respected amongst cultist metal fans all these years later. We’re talking about Lake Worth thrash heathens RAPED APE.
 
Named after car mechanic slang for something moving very quickly, RAPED APE did precisely that within the Southern Florida metal scene. Releasing three demos (1988’s In Ape We Trust, 1990’s Perpetual Aggravation and 1991’s Lost In Mind) and opening for some of the biggest metal bands at that time (CORONER, SEPULTURA, OVERKILL and M.O.D.). Eventually, the group entered the famed Morrisound Recording studios to work with producer extraordinaire Scott Burns to track their debut EP, 1993’s Terminal Reality. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Raped+Ape">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
