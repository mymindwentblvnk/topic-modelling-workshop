Darkside Chapel was formed in the Summer of 2001, the product of a now broken up thrash metal band. The bassist (Sean) and Guitarist (Joe) finding a common musical interest set out to create brutal American Black Metal as a homage to the Swedish and Norwegian bands that started it all. Joining forces, we wrote and recorded the namesake of the band "Darkside Chapel" (currently unavailable)

After a rough copy was recorded we resumed to write and record two more songs of nihilistic destruction, currently on "The Bleeding Winds of Winter (Demo)". "From a Blackened Past" and "The Bleeding Winds of Winter" are a true testament to our passion towards cold, unforgiving, BLACK METAL, the way it should be.

Darkside Chapel is a black metal band with an identity crisis. Our music cannot be compared to any one particular style of Black Metal. Because of our love of this genre we try to incorporate all our influences, some songs sounding like Dark Funeral/Darkthrone, others sounding like Children of Bodom, while some mix Opeth style influences, and so on.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Darkside+Chapel">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
