Khadaver was four piece Industrial/Electro/Blackened Metal band from Presov, Slovak Republic. The band was formed in early 2006 by Nihil Nix has released two full lenght albums before disbanding in 2016.

1. Formation and first demo (2006-2008)

At the end of 2005, by placing the ad in various on-line forums and music shops, Nihil got response from a drummer Necrocyklo he briefly knew from other bands in Prešov. Then unnamed duo started to rehearse at the beginning of 2006.

After few weeks of rehearsals, Necrocyklo's friend Hu-Zhvak was asked to join the band on bass guitar. The last member to join was lead vocalist Nekro Mantikk which was discovered by Nihil through demo tapes he got his hands on. Around that time the name Khadaver was chosen to represent the band. The first gig was played on Halloween night in 2006 at local rock club where Khadaver gained fair attention and recognition.

During the year 2007, the band worked on new material and was preparing to record a demo. In December 2007 Necrocyklo was asked to leave the band because his lack of interest in the band. Khadaver decided to use drum machine instead of live drummer further on. After Necrocyklo's departure they recorded and released the demo "Beta Version" in Summer 2008 on the Internet and in Decemeber 2008 on CD. Also, in December 2008 there was first interview with Nihil published in Slovak rock and metal magazine (now dysfunctional) Rock Planet. Throughout the year 2009 the demo was promoted via varous webzines and magazines worldwide and by playing gigs in Slovakia.

2. GOD-RW (2010)

At the beginning of 2010, Khadaver revealed recording of new websingle to be released in mid of April. In March 2010, bass player Hu-Zhvak left, decreasing count of former members to two. Not so long after, the band introduced new bass player Syonix Khalt, who became full time member. Recording process took longer than the band firstly intended, resulting into release of free downloadable EP "GOD-RW" in September 2010. It was available for free download at band's website.

Not even month after the release of the EP, Nekro Mantikk left the band without any previous indications to do so. After unsucessful search for new singer it was decided that Syonix would take the position (apart from bass playing).

3. New World Disorder (2012)

At the beginning of 2011, new live guitar player was introduced under the nickname Cyanide Dreth. The band played first two gigs abroad with this lineup in March 2011 - Pilsen and Prague, Czech Republic.

In March 2011 the band released press info that they will be recording new CD with working title "Opus Novum". The CD was mixed by Nihil and mastered by 5k0tt Mazzend of Italian act T3CHN0PH0B1A (T3CHN0PH0B1A also provided remix of title track on EP "GOD-RW"). Featuring 11 songs (including introduction track) it was released in August 2012 entitled "New World Disorder" under Creative Commons licence. The band decided not to look for any label and released it once again at their own costs.

At the end of 2012 the band acquired drummer Luxin Tenebris and with Cyanide Dreth they became full time members.

Two official videos have been shot to promote the record. The first video for the title track "New World Disorder" was released in January 2013. It has been shot and edited by Kunes of KUNES video production. The video introduced Khadaver to larger audience and helped gain the recognition both in Slovakia and abroad. The second video was released in September 2013 and it was for the song "21st Century Antichrist". The video contains only live footage captured by band's various appearances on Summer festivals. The leader of the band Nihil stated: “For a change we wanted to show how our live concerts look like, how we communicate with fans, and also some backstage shots just for fun. We are serious with our music and lyrics but when are on the stage it is always about two things – to have a good time and to do a great show.”

4. Exstinctio Mundi (2015)

After successful year 2013 consisting of many shows in clubs and on festivals in Slovak Republic (most notable was playing as support band for German thrash metal legends KREATOR) Khadaver began to work on songs for second album at the beginning of 2014. The first presented track off the record was live version of "Zeroborn" which was recorded at the finals of Wacken Metal Battle 2014 where Khadaver ended at final 5th place.

Not so long after the band informed the fans that Syonix Khalt left the band based on internal agreement. Couple of months after his departure, Cyanide Dreth decided to leave the band as well. One month later, Khadaver has welcomed new member into band - Feral Inferis - on guitars. After unsuccessful search for lead vocalist Nihil decided to take vocal duties on himself.

At the beginning of 2015, KHADAVER announced that they will record their second album "Exstinctio Mundi" in May 2015 and it will be released later the same year. The album was released on 9th November 2015.

5. Disbanding

In April 2016, Nihil Nix has decided to end the band, after 10 years. The reason he cited were lack of support and interest from Slovak labels, booking agencies, festivals, webzines and radio. Furthermore, he stated that music business does not provide fair conditions for emerging artists because of large sums of money which are required for bands to invest to gain record deal or booking contract. Full text is still available on band's Facebook page.

Khadaver combined different musical influences brought by each members into genre they call Cyber Metal. Most notable influences are black metal, electro metal, industrial metal but also death metal, thrash metal, EBM, industrial and gothic metal.
