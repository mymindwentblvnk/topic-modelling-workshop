Zambian-born, Botswana-raised and Johannesburg-based, MOONGA K. is accompanied by an ageless soul and a fresh, international perspective. His crystal vocals cut through an industry of complacency with soft, striking introspection, atop authentic instrumentation and jagged production. After successfully releasing his debut 6-track EP “Free” which was hailed for its vivid fusion of introspective neo-soul, confessional alt-pop and elements of traditional R&B, that was selected for the Apple Music New Artist Spotlight, MOONGA K. returned with debut full-length effort “Wild Solace” in 2018. Marrying the smooth musings of traditional and modern R&B with a razor- edge, electronic outline – an alternative and wholly unique offering announces his effervescent presence with pure soul. Produced by SAMA winner Greg Carlin, and childhood friend Andrew Williams, “Wild Solace” sways from indie rock rhythms to soulful piano drama. He’s performed at Rocking the Daisies, OppiKoppi, Splashy Fen, Smoking Dragon and Park Acoustics, to name a few over the last two years. His 2020 EP “an ode to growth,” is an Alt. R&B/Soul focused record that discusses love in all its forms and how growth is a necessity for healing. The project features contributions from more producers and was released in May, 2020. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Moonga+K.">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
