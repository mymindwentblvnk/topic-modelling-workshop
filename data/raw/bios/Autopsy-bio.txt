There are multiple artists with this name:

1) Autopsy is an influential death metal band, founded in 1987 in the United States by Chris Reifert after leaving Death. Beginning their career with the Severed Survival LP, Autopsy took on a sound similar to that of Scream Bloody Gore era Death, but soon moved on to a doom metal influenced sound for the Retribution for the Dead EP. The next full-length, Mental Funeral, would expand on Autopsy's "death doom" style of metal, and was met with great critical acclaim. Having completed a successful European tour soon after Mental Funeral, the band reentered the studio to record the Fiend for Blood EP, which was followed by their third full-length, Acts of the Unspeakable. Autopsy's last album, 1994's Shitfun, was heavily influenced by hardcore punk and would prepare fans for Abscess, Danny Coralles and Chris Reifert's project after Autopsy's demise in 1995, but as of July 2009, have reunited.

The band was featured in the 2005 music documentary Metal: A Headbanger's Journey when the film's narrator and star read aloud a verse from the band's song "Charred Remains".

Autopsy released their album Macabre Eternal in 2011 via Peaceville Records to wide critical acclaim, followed by 2013's album The Headless Ritual, 2014's album Tourniquets, Hacksaws and Graves, and 2015's EP Skull Grinder.
