Morbid Theory is now known as Osyron. They are a Canadian metal band from Sarnia, Ontario. The band was founded in late 2004 by both guitarists, Krzysztof Stalmach and Bobby Harley. There have been a few line-up changes throughout the years, but now consists of vocalist Bobby Redman, guitarists Krzysztof Stalmach and Bobby Harley, and keyboardist Dave Bauman.

Starting off by covering songs from bands like Metallica, In Flames, and Children of Bodom, Morbid Theory soon after wanted to start writing original material. They wrote their first actual demo, Chaos Breed, in early 2006 and went to the studio to record it that summer. It was released in December 2006, and the band went to go on and play numerous shows throughout the years with bands like Norther, Protest the Hero, Threat Signal, Quo Vadis, and The Agonist.

In the summer of 2009, Morbid Theory started writing material for their first full-length, Harbinger. They recorded the album at Ice House Studios (Goderich, Ontario) in January 2010 and finished recording it in February. The album was then released digitally in August, and the band are now promoting it.

Harbinger is the first album of a trilogy for the story. It strives to be something different from their demo, and different from those around it. It's a concept album, and is a tale of one man's struggle against his quickly, and tragically changing environment. It's a very progressive album with no two songs sounding the same, and has a bunch of different styles ranging from aggressive/heavy to very melodic/catchy to epic/folk to thrash to power.

In February of 2011, the band announced on their myspace page they were changing the band name to Osyron to reflec recent member changes. The band are planning to re-record Harbinger and release it under the new name. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Morbid+Theory">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
