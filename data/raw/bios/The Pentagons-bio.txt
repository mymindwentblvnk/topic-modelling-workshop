A late 50's, 1960's vocal doo-wop style group from San Bernadino CA, their most popular recordings featured lead vocalist Joe C Jones. They are considered by many as a one hit wonder, and their song "To Be Loved (Forever)", which hit #48 on national pop charts in 1961,  continues to endure as a "lowrider" oldies classic. Other members besides Jones included Carl McGinnis, Otis Munson (tenor) and the Goodloe brothers Ted Goodloe (tenor) and Ken Goodloe (baritone, piano).  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Pentagons">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
