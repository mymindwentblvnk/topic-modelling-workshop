Skies Devoured began circa summer 2005 with the moniker "Enraged." Vocalist, Daniels Bagnato, and guitarist, Gerardo Salazar, desired to create and play music they had fermenting within themselves for years. They set out to play epic melodic metal influenced by European acts--especially those hailing from the Nordic nations. They recruited their good friend, Michael Gon√ßalves, as bassist, but he later switched over as the second guitarist. At this point, Gerardo, Daniels, and Michael, continued writing music for the band.

Gustavo Cunha was recruited as bassist. However, the band was in dire need of a drummer. After long months of searching for a permanent drummer, Brian Stoma entered the scene. The lineup was finally complete circa summer 2006. At this time, the group unanimously settle on the name "Skies Devoured." They practiced throughout the remains of 2006. Unfortunately, Brian Stoma left Skies Devoured, leaving the band without a drummer. Close friend John Paul Andrade of Death by Names is now undertaking drum duties for the band.
