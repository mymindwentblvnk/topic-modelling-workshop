NightMyHeaven's formation took place in Guimarães, Portugal in 2003.

It was "born" of the gathering of different band members: David (vocals), João Filipe (guitar player), Nuno Cardoso (guitar player), Helder (bass), Bruno (keyboards) - all them ex-members of Last Prophecy - and Nuno (drums) - ex-member of Seraphytus.

At the beginning the band played themes of Last Prophecy such as The Other Side and Unknown Reality.

After the composition of new songs like Lost in Darkness, The Passage, NightMyHeaven, among others, the band recorded an EP at Closet Studios, during April 2005. Having finished the EP recording, Nuno Cardoso, due to professional reasons, left the band. Nevertheless, the band soon found Alexandre.

In 2007 we lost the drummer, Nuno left the band. The band made some casting but all the drummers don't feel technically comfortable. After that, the band decided to carry on with programmed drums wich was made by the new member Toninho.

In 2009 NightMyHeaven composed who was his debut album, Nightology, released in early 2010, a thematic album, focused on mythology. In this new album have added new elements to the composition, such as orchestrations, and a third voice interpreted by the lead singer, giving to the new sound a little more agression. This new album was entirely recorded and produced by the band at NMHStudio property of two members.

In late 2009 and for health reasons bassist Helder left, entering in 2010 the new member André, and now Alfredo sing the guttural voice.

The band is promoting the new album and looking for a label. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nightmyheaven">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
