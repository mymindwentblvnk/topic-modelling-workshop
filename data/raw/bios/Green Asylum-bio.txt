Green Asylum (Begotten until 04/01/13) – polish stoner metal band formed in Puławy in the late 2010 by Maciej Kopiński (el. guitar), and Maciej Kowalczyk (bass guitar). After some personnel changes, the most recent team consists of:

- Michał Reszka (from 04.2011) – vocals
- Maciej Kopiński (from 11.2010) – electric guitar
- Maciej Kowalczyk (from 11.2010) – bass guitar
- Mateusz Stańczak (from 10.2012) – keyboards, sampling
- Daniel Nowak (from 06.2012) – drums

Past members:
- Aleksander Wasilewski (11.2010 – 02.2011) – drums 
- Paweł Marcinko (02.2011 – 04.2011) – drums 
- Maciej Ciupa (04.2011 – 04.2012) – drums

The idea is to play on everything that is low-tuned, and to play everything that is filled with cooled polish beer, rolled cigarette, frivolous fuzz, dust, old-timers and of course beautiful women. That mixture will be published on vinyls soon, but before that, feel invited to all the shows you can find by clicking “on tour” button. Stay stoned!
