As an early thought, the band 54 was based on a mathematical philosophical world view. Numbers was the idea that brings the aspects and themes together, and through analysis on different levels the lyrics were written. 

In 2003 the band consisted of two musicians, drums and vocals, becoming #44 and #25. Soon after two musicians (#86 and #30) joined from a fellow band and completed the live line-up for 54. During this period the vocalist #44 lived in England due to education, which made most of the work done by email when the demo “PHI” was mixed in 2004. The first show was at Strømmen, Norway in 2004 as a warm up act for local band Minas Tirith. Though there were scarce participants in the audience, a few celebrities such as Galder and Mustis (Dimmu Borgir) were present.

In 2005 #30 and #86 moved to Germany leaving the band. This left us back where we started, and a long break followed where other bands were main priorities. After this time apart we have decided to start the machinery once again. New numbers and new members are now in place, and the first full length album “Defining Eternity” is on its way.
