This unholy union was conceived in the frozen lands of northern New York, and then incubated in the stench of a New Jersey landfill. Only then could it be born into the shadows of Philadelphia. An offering to the masses of epic proportions. A metal band influenced by punk rock, classic rock, and jazz warmed over with a touch of New York hardcore, speed metal, and just plain sludge. The result is a collection of songs so familiar you'll wonder why you've never heard them before. A sound so unique it can only be labeled as one genre...The Fetals. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Fetals">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
