Driven by a musical and lyrical force; Moment of Fierce Determination is just as their name states. Started in early 2009, MOFD emerged after brothers Bubba and Robert reunited with their long lost brother Jeremy after a sixteen year hiatus. Shortly after reuniting, Jeremy moved to Arkansas, in which Bubba, Robert, and Jeremy joined forces with childhood friend Jim. The men began crafting the heavy metal riffs that would become the backbone of MOFD’s 24ft metal monster sound. Now needing only a drummer to give life to MOFD’s iron fist, Bubba looked to a young friend named Ben. Bubba was aware of Ben’s unholy machine-like abilities to play drums, and felt that if there was anyone who could complete the line-up to MOFD it would be him. Now with Ben in the ranks of MOFD, the band now stood as a solid contender in the battlefield of metal. After a few months of polishing their sound MOFD stepped into, long time friend, Richard Yang’s newly constructed Thundertank Studio; it would be here that MOFD would record the sounds that the world would come to know as Fear….Itself. 
Fear….Itself is a four track appetizer to the massive amount of solid metal you can bare witness to at one of their live shows. Laced with styles of Slayer to Obituary, MOFD’s Fear….Itself Ep album is a prologue of things to come. Featuring songs like: Fear….Itself, Exit in death, and the unbelievable mind twisting hit Seventh sign. Geared to conquer their home state and venture into a full tour in the coming year of 2011, MOFD is set to show fans and critics alike that Arkansas has a hidden demon of metal lurking in its natural state woods. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Moment+of+Fierce+Determination">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
