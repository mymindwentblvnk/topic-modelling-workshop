Visceral Throne was created between two friends in 2009 to create a intense listening experience filled with an abundance of riffs, accessing dark and dissonant riffing, fast technical riffs and slam and groove rhythms, combining to create a whirlwind of ideas and a constant variety of tempos. Visceral Throne released a two song demo for an internet release and shortly after Brutal Bands signed the band for a two album deal. Our first full length album, "Omnipotent Asperity" is now available at www.brutalbands.com. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Visceral+Throne">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
