Mons Veneris manifested itself for the first time in the Winter of '03 under the cold Moonlight but the concept of its creation is older. All Art expressed here is totally dedicated to The Master, Creator and Destroyer of all existence, Sathanas. Mons Veneris was baptized in Flames of Darkness and it will remain devoted to it. 

During these years Mons Veneris has been active and releasing material without getting noticed, crawling in the muddy waters of the Darkness swamps. Now, the time has come to damn "humanity" and their feeble god of light, to torment the nazarene pig and his jewish sheep-minded followers.
