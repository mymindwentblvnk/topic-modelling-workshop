Excommunion was a metal band from Colorado Springs, USA. Excommunion formed in 1998 and played their own blend of blackened death metal; untypical for black/death metal are the pig-squeal like vocals, characteristic for brutal death metal, which is probably the reason why Excommunion mostly gets labled as brutal death metal. After their only full-lenght album "Superion" released in 2001 and two more split-albums in 2001 and 2006, they've split-up. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Excommunion">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
