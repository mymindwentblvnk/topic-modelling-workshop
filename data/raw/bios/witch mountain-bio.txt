Witch Mountain is a stoner/doom metal band formed in Portland, USA in 1997 by Rob Wrong (Iommi Stubbs, ex-M99) and Nate Carson (Point Line Plane, Two Ton Boa, Sunn O))) collaborator, etc). In 2000 the demo "Homegrown Doom" was released in Europe, and Dave Hoopaugh (Iommi Stubbs, Coma Void, Towers) was brought to be the bass player.

Debut album Come the Mountain was released in 2001, selling its first printing in 2 months. A period of hibernation went into effect at 2002, mostly for family reasons.The band reunited and started touring again in 2005.

After a July 2009 show opening for Pentagram, guest singer Uta Plotkin was asked to join the band as main vocalist, marking a revival of the band. Witch Mountain's second full-length album, South of Salem, was recorded six months later at Smegma Studios, produced by Billy Anderson, and released in April 2011, coinciding with a SXSW tour.

In November 2011, Witch Mountain was signed with Profound Lore. In February 2012, Dave Hoopaugh left the band to concentrate on family and other projects, leaving bass duties to Billions and Billions member Neal Munson. Witch Mountain released their third full-length album,  Cauldron of the Wild, on June 2012.

In the summer of 2013 Neal Munson left the band and was replaced by the man-ape bass wrangler known as Charles Thomas. A new album is in the works for 2014. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Witch+Mountain">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
