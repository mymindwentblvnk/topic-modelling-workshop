Unlike other Turkish psychedelic stars of the time, Derdiyoklar made their name first and actually only among the “gastarbeiter” Turks in Germany. They played weddings and parties almost exclusively of Turkish workers and rural population; clung tightly to their Turkish roots, in the face of cultural shock and obvious social problems. Their lyrics converged around socio-political and cultural topics of the era. 

Ali Ekber Aydoğan, the brains of the operation, was (and he still is) a progressive, so he forged these Turkish topics and traditional music with new forms that he was hearing in Europe at the time, creating a new musical genre named Diskofolk. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Derdiyoklar+I%CC%87kilisi">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
