There is more then one band with the name Jihad:

1. "Jihad," as you probably already know, is the Islamic term for inner struggle or "holy war", but it is also the name of a now-defunct Kalamazoo hardcore quartet whose sound suggests the violence and fury of that aggression. Their music is about anger, anger, and more anger. Their anthems of loneliness and alienation are filled with chugging, double-edged guitars, which create volcanoes of sound on top of smoldering bass and drum rhythms. Horrifyingly ragged, voice box-disgorging vocals lace every composition. Bitter, caustic stuff. Jihad disbanded in the latter part of the '90s. Old Testament represents the band's complete discography up to 1995, plus a live set at a Cleveland hardcore festival. The releases that are not on the CD are the Self-Titled Demo cassette from 1993, the New Testament 7" (1997) and a song on the Longbow Project Compilation 12", Love/Hate.

2. There is also a one-man electronic/darkwave project called Jihad, from Venezuela. Wismar Pulido does all keyboards, vocals and programming, and released a full length album in 2003 entitled Hymns from the Underworld in Flames.

3. JIHAD is also a death metal band from Bandung, Indonesia. They already released 3 albums:  "Besok Qiamat" (2003), "Strategi Setan" (2005) and Origin of the Rebels Angels (2013)

4. JIHAD was the solo project of  Rich Mendez, the vocalist from Benestrophe, and James Mendez.  One album was released, A Prayer In The Night, which was of similar style to Benestrophe and Mentallo & The Fixer <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jihad">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
