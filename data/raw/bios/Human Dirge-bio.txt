The band was created in May 2006 by John and Namtar with the idea to mix the black metal sound with gothic ambient. The first name of the band was "Oscura Poetry" and was linked to their dark lyrics and slow melancholy riffs. After some lineup changes they have drove the sound to something more "raw and aggressive" leaving the old way. The product is a sort of original thrash with death and progressive influences, where rash riffs accompany the visionary voice. So the band name changed from "Oscura Poetry" to "Human Dirge", a way to underline their message and their evolution. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Human+Dirge">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
