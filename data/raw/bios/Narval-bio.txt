There are two bands known as Narval:

1. A Classic Metal band from Puerto Rico formed on 2005 by Dennis Torres (Dantesco), Raly Vega (Sacrilegio) and Erico "La Bestia" (Dantesco) with the idea of merging the styles of Heavy Metal and Progressive Rock from the 70's, 80's and 90's to create a fusion of a unique style.
The band performed with Bengie (Mantarraya) as drummer in the late 2006, but then on 2007 Bengie decided to leave the band for personal reasons.
It is not until the beginning of 2008 that band decided to take their musical project to the next level and record their music at home. A 13 track album was born and brought into cohesion and on 2009 released by Stormspell Records.

2. A French steampunk themed melodic death metal band.
