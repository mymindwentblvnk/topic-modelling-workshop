The Arkitecht is a one-man band created by Genaro Ochoa in Mexico City. The idea of the project is to be non-dependable on other musicians to accomplish a "band" sound. It is a blend of several metal and progressive sub-genres thus resulting in an intrincated combination of styles.

There are a number a guest musicians, among them Cesar Huesca, Dante Diaz (War Kabinett) and Alvaro Lamadrid.

The influnces range from bands like Porcupine Tree, Symphony X, the score for the Matrix Trilogy, and also grunge and modern metal bands.
