Labyrinth Ear are a UK electronic duo made up of Emily and Tom. Coming from different sides of London, they were brought together by mutual tastes in music, while each bringing their own set of influences. Emilyâ€™s folk-like lyrics invoke colourful, visual stories, while bringing together a wide range of musical influences, ranging from classic film scores, world music and vintage electronica. With songs that are both melancholic and euphoric, they combine samples with synths and psychedelic, worldly sounds along with child-like vocals to create fantasia pop music with a foot in the past, present and future.
