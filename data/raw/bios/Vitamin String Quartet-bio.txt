The String Quartet Tribute is a series of string quartet covers released by Vitamin Records by several different groups of musicians. They focus on one band per record, and perform classical versions of their songs, generally note for note. They use a wide array of instruments but focus mainly on violins, violas, and cellos. Over the years, they have put out a large number of albums (232), honoring mainstream and indie groups alike. They have put a classical spin on many genres of music, including rock, pop, punk, techno, hardcore, country, metal and rap.

Todd Mark Rubenstein has led one of several groups of players that have released albums in the series. This includes Exit... Stage Right: String Quartet Tribute to Rush which was nominated for a Grammy. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vitamin+String+Quartet">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
