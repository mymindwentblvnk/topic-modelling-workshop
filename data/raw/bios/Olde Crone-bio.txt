4 piece Doom/Stoner band from Welwyn Garden City, UK.
Olde Crone were a psychedelic doom band from the Shire born strong and true to each other out of a glorious haze of weed and Sabbath worship.
The Crone are sadly now no more. but memebers can be found flaunting their talent in such current bands as Serpent Venom and Trippy Wicked
