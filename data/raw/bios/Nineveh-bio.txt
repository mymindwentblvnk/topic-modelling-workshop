At least two bands go by the name Nineveh.

1) Defunct alternative rock band from Muskegon, MI. Nineveh were active from 2004-2008. Played at the first ever show at 3358 8th Street (now 3358 studios), later affiliated with the label during their last year together, producing, the result of which was the Studiote demo. Most of the lineup went on to form 3358 Records band Audrey. Members - Everett Parks (Vocals), Corey Bickford (Guitar), John Tibbits (Guitar), Eli Cane (Bass), Derek Bauer (Drums)

2) An unsigned experimental thrash metal band from Chehalis, WA with a self-titled EP containing 4 tracks. The band members include: Bill Baxter on vocals/rhythm guitar; Cameron Dean on bass; James Cox on drums; Vern Boswell on lead guitar. "Nineveh is a band that draws influences from a very diverse selection of music. From bands like Slayer, Metallica and Meshuggah to Pantera, Iron Maiden and Deftones. We try to infuse the fast heavy riffage of thrash with the intricacy and diversity of math metal. The end result is Nineveh. A band that forges their own unique path in sound, while releasing 110% aggression or leading you deep into a thoughtful peace."
