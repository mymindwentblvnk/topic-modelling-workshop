There is more than one artist with this name:
 
1) Rat Attack is former Ratt singer Stephen Pearcy re-recording songs he performed with Ratt (and previous incarnation Mickey Ratt).

Due to his not having the legal rights to use the name Ratt, he performed the songs under this artist name.

Former L.A. Guns guitarist Tracii Guns and former Dokken guitarist George Lynch are among those who perform as guests on the sole album.

These are all-new recordings of old Ratt and Mickey Ratt songs, thus there is no real new material released under this artist name.


2) Rat Attack was a short lived heavy metal band from Hawaii that played straight ahead  metal. Their only recorded output was a 1983 self financed album/demo which became regarded as an early speed/power metal classic. This self titled release was re-issued on cd with bonus tracks in 2008 by Old Metal Records.


3) Rat Attack is a hardcore band from Algarve, Portugal.
