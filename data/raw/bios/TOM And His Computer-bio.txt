TOM And His Computer is the newest alias for Copenhagen favourite Thomas Bertelsen. He started out as a teenager by looping and creating beats on his 4 track tape-recorder. Since then the very talented producer and DJ has been around the block. He produced two albums (with Lulu Rouge) and a number of songs, edits and remixes. He has also been DJing alongside Trentemøller every now and then since the early days and most recently TOM And His Computer performed live on the opening slot of Trentemøller’s latest live tour and lately at Sonar Copenhagen 2015. 

Working alongside Anders Trentemøller’s label In My Room! on the EPs 'Small Disasters' (released in 2016) and 'Playing In The Night' (released in 2017), the Danish artist has produced his most rounded, mature work yet. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/TOM+And+His+Computer">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
