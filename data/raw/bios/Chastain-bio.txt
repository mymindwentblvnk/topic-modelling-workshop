Chastain  is a long running heavy metal project formed in 1984, spearheaded by guitarist David T. Chastain .

First formed in 1984, in Cincinnati, Ohio, Chastain  featured ex-Rude Girl and Malibu Barbi  vocalist Leather  Leone, bassist Mike Skimmerhorn, and future Cinderella drummer Fred Coury. This quartet performed on Chastain 's debut, Mystery of Illusion .
1986's Ruler of the Wasteland,  was recorded with Coury's successor Ken Mary and, along with 1987's The 7th of Never, is still considered by many to be Chastain 's finest hour. 
New bassist David Harbour made his debut on 1988's Voice of the Cult.
1990's For Those Who Dare saw John Luke Hebert replacing Mary, who went on to join Alice Cooper . 
It wasn't until 1995 that a new Chastain  album, Sick Society, would surface, and even though the band's basic metal sound remained intact, both it and 1997's In Dementia contained a new-line-up rounded out by singer Kate French, bassist Kevin Kekes, and former Trouble drummer Dennis Lesh. This second coming was to be a brief one, however, and Chastain  would once again vanish for many years before finally returning with 2004's In an Outrage album. 
Founder and guitarist David T. Chastain  is currently at work on the long awaited follow up cd to 2004's In an Outrage.
