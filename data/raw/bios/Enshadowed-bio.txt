Black metal band from Athens, Greece formed in 1998. Their lyrics focus on nihilism, anti-religion, death, blasphemy, and chaos. Three full length albums have been released - Messengers of the Darkest Dawn (2002), Intensity (2003) and Magic Chaos Psychedelia (2013).

After four demos released between 1998 and 2001, during which they called themselves "Nocternity Enshadowed" and had various bassists, vocalists, and drummers - the only constant member being guitarist Necrotormentor - they recorded their debut album in Autumn 2001, Messengers of the Darkest Dawn released on Black Lotus Records in 2002 (Reissued 2007 on vinyl with two cover tracks of Bathory and Von & all their demos on a bonus second LP. Also reissued 2007 on cassette tape & digipak CD with their fourth demo as bonus. Each edition has new exclusive artwork). This album was pure, straightforward no-frills black metal with melody that only Greek bands have. 
All members aside from Necrotormentor left the band after its release, and with new members hired, including T.K. from Dead Congregation and Burial Hordes on rhythm guitar, they recorded a follow up album in 2002 - Intensity - released once again by Black Lotus in 2003. To the surprise (and dismay) of listeners, this album was pure death metal, completely unlike the black metal debut album. 

Following this surprising and abrupt change of style, the band released a compilation on cassette tape called Awaken The Dead in 2005 by Goat Music Records, consisting of the 1999, 2000, and 2001 Nocternity Enshadowed demo tapes. Then a live album in 2006, Dressed in Blood recorded in Athens, 2005. It features only black metal tracks, including a cover of Panzer Division Marduk. 
Afterwards, two splits were released in 2007, one with Mantak, the other with infamous American black metallers Thornspawn; and splits in 2009 (with Vulturine), 2010 (with Devathorn, Burial Hordes, & Angstridden), and 2012 (with Burial Hordes). 

The third album, marking a return of the black metal sound, albeit in a different - more dissonant and refined form - was recorded between 2010 and 2011 with new members Golgotha on bass & keyboards, Serpent on vocals, and session drummer Impaler (Burial Hordes) also featuring guest percussion by Necromantia drummer Fotis Benardo and ex-Acrimonious bassist / ex-Burial Hordes drummer Geegor on the title track. This album, titled Magic Chaos Psychedelia was released January 2013 on CD by Pulverised Records (cassette tape by Hammer of Damnation, May 2013, and vinyl edition with alternate artwork by Aphelion Productions, September 2014).
