Based in St.Louis, Joseph Raglani is a veteran of the experimental sub-underground, having released an LP, tapes, CD-R's, and small-run CDs through labels such as Gameboy, IDES, Kvist and his own Pegasus Farms.

Raglani drew the vocabulary of his sonic imagery from film (The New World, Aguirre) and the early Nonesuch documents of 'world music' (especially Peruvian and Andean folk music), distilling from these the dreamwork of epic travel and the alien strangeness of other cultures imagined through legend. Song forms are dissolved here, but still present; electronic and acoustic sources blend seamlessly into majestically glittering waves. Though its indebtedness to the dark romanticism of krautrock is clear, this is not an electronic trip through well-worn evocations of cosmic space. It is rather a story about the submerged memory of mythic voyages, of a time when every far-off destination was alluring, dangerous, and questionably real, envisioned from the perspective of a world well-mapped and conquered by machines.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Raglani">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
