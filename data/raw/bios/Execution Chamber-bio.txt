Execution Chamber began to take form in the Summer of 2005. They had began practicing and and several line-up changes took place in the process. By late 2005 no more than four songs were written, which would become a demo known as 'Black Winter' (Coinciding with the time of year it would be made). Although this never went ahead and in their form these songs were never recorded.
An additional problem was to be that the band did not have a vocalist, which was one of the reasons this demo never went ahead. Although maybe to the bands advantage they began writing new songs such as 'The Shore Bleeds Red' and 'Born In Black', and in December Paul joined the band as vocalist.
The guitar and bass riffs from one of the earlier songs (name of 'Lone Freak') were used and the song was renamed 'Paradise', a direct result of Pauls lyrics. These three songs became the bands first demo, and recorded at Chime Studios, it would be entitled 'A Portrait of Heaven'.
Successful gigs followed the demo although recent line-up changes forced the band to stop gigging and during this time they began songwriting again. With the arrival of Laura as keyboard player the band began being able to include keyboard, have since have lined up several gigs, and are also currently writing and recording the next release with the aid of new lead guitarist, Taylor.
With a new dimension of sound (although still staying faithful enough to the style of old), and with able-minded sound engineers in the band, eXc promises a severe onslaught of gigs and releases in the very near future.
