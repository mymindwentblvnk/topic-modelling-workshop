This White Mountain is the brain-child of founding member and sole-writing force, Kevin Narowski. Formed in late 2008 in Connecticut, USA, an instrumental EP was quickly recorded and released. The self-titled EP received very positive feedback from a wide range of listeners, and one or two notable review websites. A rough demo of 3 new songs was recorded and released shortly after.

While the band's debut full-length album was being finished, new material was written and recorded for the Spanning the Void demo album. Once again, completely created by the band's sole member, Spanning the Void is a foray into more a more aggressive black metal sound, while the EP and subsequent full-length were a more atmosphere-centric effort. Even with the intense aggression on the demo, the music doesn't lose its sense of atmosphere or melody.

This White Mountain is truly a black metal band at its core, but it's composition uniquely captures and translates sounds from genres like post-rock, ambient, folk, and of course, the darker side of black metal. Similar to the bands Agalloch, Alcest, Drudkh, and Wolves in the Throne Room, Kevin still manages to define the band as it's own individual entity, and not just a knock off of a more popular act. The band doesn't concern itself with an image or any sort of pretense, only with making the kind of diverse and passionate music it loves.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/This+White+Mountain">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
