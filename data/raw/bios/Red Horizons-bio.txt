Red Horizons is a melodic death metal duo from Hastings, NZ, founded by Josh Astridge and Jack Noble (Returning We Hear the Larks), the second-cousin of Astridge, living on the opposite side of the globe. 

For both full albums, the members' duties were as follows:
Josh Astridge: writing, guitars, lyrics, drum patterns
Jack Noble: production, bass, drum programming, vocals

Red Horizons formed in late 2010 and released their debut album 'Angelic' on October 21st, 2011. The band's sophomore full-length 'Broken Beyond Repair' was released on November 19th, 2012. 

A new single 'Heartsick' was released in December 2013. The single featured vocals by Ben Read (of The Mark of Man and 8 Foot Sativa) and was the first track to be mixed collaboratively by Astridge and Noble, as their first meeting in person occurred around this time. In February 2014, Noble announced his departure, returning the band to Astridge's solo project. Astridge worked on a third album entitled 'Heartsick' through 2015, but the album was eventually scrapped. In 2016, Noble rejoined the group and the single 'Puppets' was released. The duo are currently re-recording their debut album 'Angelic' for its five-year anniversary.

Both of Red Horizons' albums are available for free download at BandCamp. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Red+Horizons">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
