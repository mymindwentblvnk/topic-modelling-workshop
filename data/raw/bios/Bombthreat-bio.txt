1. This explosive hip hop group has been critically acclaimed for their innovative and ambitious efforts to elevate hard-core hip hop music to the next level. In 1996, their debut, Explosive Material, was named as one of the best locally produced records in two different Cincinnati area publications. In 1997, BOMBTHREAT spent most of their time traveling, gigging, and campaigning as much as possible in support of their debut. The results were, to say the least, pleasing. BOMBTHREAT, with the help of their label Powerblast Recordings, independently sold well over 2000 copies of Explosive Material. BOMBTHREAT's local success was due in part to them staying away from the same, "gangsta", subject matter associated with many of today’s hard-core rap records. The powerful and mind changing effects of their music afforded them the right to boast, "Many of our fans say they didn’t even listen to rap before they heard us...that says somethin’ if someone who hated a form of music, before they heard your expression, is now a big fan." With Destructive Communication, the group has underwent a lineup change. BOMBTHREAT is now a foursome. The G has assembled a new team of lyricists in the form of Mayhem, and femme fatal, Short Body. Together they have unleashed the best hip hop material and live performances ever produced by an act from Cincinnati, Ohio.
