Au Revoir Simone is an indie pop band from Brooklyn, New York that formed in late 2003. The group consists of Erika Forster (vocals/keyboard), Annie Hart (vocals/keyboard), and Heather D'Angelo (vocals/drum machine/keyboard).

The band name comes from a minor character in Tim Burton's Pee-Wee's Big Adventure.

A mini-album 'Verses of Comfort, Assurance, and Salvation' was followed in early 2007 by 'The Bird of Music', on the Moshi Moshi label.
