In 1984 guitarist Jan Akesson and singer Peter Grundstrom got to know each other after a mutual concert. Jan played guitar in a band called Ravage and Peter was a singer in a band called Whitelight. Their meeting led to the conclusion of Jans' work with his band and he became a new member in Whitelight in that very year.
However, in 1987 Jan decided to leave Whitelight and went his own way. Peter stayed in Whitelight but Jan wasn't replaced. Instead the name of the band was changed to Kee Avenue. Jan established a new band called Why Not and later he also established new bands like Perfect Stranger and Dr Blue. These bands did really successful gigs and recordings in different places.
In 1994 Jan stepped down from the stages, but kept on writing songs and recorded them in Cubase.  
Kee Avenue split up in 1991 after the bassplayer and the keyboardplayer left the band. The band never found anyone tho replace them. After this breakup Peter played with different band, mostley coverband, and he kept on writing songs. 

15 years later the two played together. Jan called Peter on the phone, because he tought that it was time for a reunion. After a good meal, a few beers and whiskey the interest grew to once more form a project. The result of this was StoneLake.
Afet the succesful debut "Reincarnation", the band released it's second album in the late 2007, called "Worlds Entry". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Stonelake">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
