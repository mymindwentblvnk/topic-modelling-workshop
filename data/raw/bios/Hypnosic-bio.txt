Hypnosic started in september 1989. in Belgrade (still old Yugoslavia, now Serbia). After three months they recorded first demo, with three songs. Unsatisfied with the sound of the first demo, the band recording it again in april 1990. Titled “Demon’s Revenge”. Better sound quality and many concerts gave larger popularity to the band. After some personal changes in march 1991, Hypnosic entered the studio and recorded their second demo called “Art Of Terror” in october 1991. With their new demo the band
acomplished succes. But for the reasons that we already know (war crisis in Yugoslavia) the band split up. In 1996 they contiued their work as MrDr (Murder), with new influences and with some personal changes on bass guitar (Spale) and with only one guitar (Wrba), but it didn’t last long. There’s no official releases from thet period except some live gigs in studio <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hypnosic">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
