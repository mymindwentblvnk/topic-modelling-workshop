Dark Philosophy was formed in Egypt,  in the summer of 2004 when Noor (Mephisto), Amr and Hesham (Yakov) decided they wanted to start a black metal project. Influenced by a variety of bands, mainly old black and doom bands, the band wanted to play something that had the grim spirit of the old raw black metal and also the accessibility of the more melodic bands mixed with the doom elements of the early death/doom acts, especially the Peaceville Three. Guitarist Shabasy (Ash) soon joined the band only to leave 3 months later, to be replaced by Ahmed Ismail, who further on added to the band's many influences. Keyboardist Ameera also soon joined the band. This and the geographical influence resulted in a sound that is at least unique, a homogeneous mixture of melodic black metal and less prominent other various influences. The band's first release, The World of Barzakh, came out during late 2005. The band is supposed to be releasing their first demo in summer 2006. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dark+Philosophy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
