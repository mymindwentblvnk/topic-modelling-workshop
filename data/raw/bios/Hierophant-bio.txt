There are multiple artists with this name:

1.) Hierophant is very slow, raw and atmospheric funeral doom metal project of Xathagorra Mlandroth - one of the founders of funeral doom itself (with Thergothon, Skepticism, Funeral and others).
The music is always very slow, depressive and weighty (extremely). All tracks are quite primitive, but it can be requited by unique and deep atmosphere of solitude and endless darkness.
Continued by Catacombs.

2.) Slow downtempo group comprising Willy B (Guitar), Neil Cowley (Keyboards) and  MC T.K.O. (Vocals) - written and produced by Dick Trevor and Ed Bigland. Their tracks include Easy Glyder which appears on Backroom Beats (Twisted Records) and Need To Know (Bushmen Freefall Mix) appearing on Backroom Beats Vol 2.   

3.) Plodding and thrashing hardcore/metal from Victoria BC in the vein of Cursed and Converge. Broke up in September '09. Two members are in a new project yet untitled...

4) Italian dark metalcore & black/death metal. Formed in 2009, released 3 full length albums since 2010. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hierophant">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
