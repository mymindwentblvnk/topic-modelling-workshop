Domovoyd is a psychedelic doom band from Western Finland.

Echoing guitars from the grooves of distant space, Domovoyd drone forth their debut album "Oh Sensibility." Detonated in the year 2010, the band has risen to the forefront of the Finnish Underground. Masters of dark, hypnotic, sprawling hazed-out doom, their music is a flaming celebration of the psychedelic arts from the temples of Hawkwind to Matt Pike's altar of the riff. Capturing the live-energy that has electrified audiences with their unique, heavy dose of rhythmic sludge, Oh Sensibility is an album that drone heads and doom freaks cannot afford to miss.

Swilling the world about in their mouths and spitting it through a cosmic spiral, Domovoyd know how to traverse time and space, and have the necessary intoxicating ingredients to take you there. Saddle up your space rocket and say goodbye to your sensibilities, as Domovoyd, smoking long dead galaxies in their wake, blast you into the furthest reaches of beyond.


In October 2013, Domovoyd released their debut album 'Oh Sensibility' via Svart Records.

In May 2011, Domovoyd released their first EP called 'Mythonaut' which includes 6 tracks. Mythonaut is about mythological journey through one's mind.

In October 2010, Domovoyd released their first promo album which includes 4 tracks. Promo album was released under the previous name of the band; 'Potbelly'.
