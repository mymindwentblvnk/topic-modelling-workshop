The heathen spirit of Midwynter relies on the pagan past of the band's belief, A time when middle eastern religions began to influence homelands of Europe, and later Vinland. A time without monotheistic following, a time when the forest and mighty mountains, of secluded streams and serene lakes, the elements and the spirit, were aligned by the many gods to follow the neutrality of nature's being.
