It’s widely known that mosh funk in the 21st century is best done zonked and fried by Boston natives Guerilla Toss. There’s no doubt these kids are some of the hardest working acid causalities in all four corners of the underground, with shout outs and respect given by legendary rippers such as Henry Rollins and John Zorn. And they aren’t stopping anytime soon. Guerilla Toss continues to navigate through the realms of brutal groove, psychotic arrangements, and complete lack of ethical harmony.
