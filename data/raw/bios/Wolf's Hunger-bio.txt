Wolf's Hunger as an idea has existed since 2001. Goal was to create a project which would vary from the whole extreme metal scene, to create a form of patriotic black metal, with lyrics about Serbian mythology and history. The first name of the project was Altair's Stone -that was supposed to be an ambient/home-made form of black metal, since there was no drummer involved. In the year of 2002 a decision was made by the members of the band which were Dushan, Chaslav and Veljko: to find a drummer and to start to create a different, more thrashy music. That drummer was Djuka, but something was still missing: the second guitar, then Dovla joined the band, (and Dushan left the band, but all of his lyrics are still in use, with his permission) which has changed its name to Wolf's Hunger . In august 2003 the first material was recorded Thunders of Perun Are Back (DEMO) which is actually a live recording (only the vocals were done separately). In spite of the very raw sound which it possessed, it got very positive reactions and reviews, even though the band itself was not very satisfied with it. There were a few gigs with domestic bands such as Interfector, All My Sins, Defilement, Posmrtna Liturgija... In the year of 2004 Djuka decided to leave the band, but after a few months WH has found a new drummer.
