The idea of Mind Affliction came up in 2009, but the band had problems finding a long-term second guitar player until 2010. In September 2010 the band finally emerged consisting of four members: Dariusz Zabrzeński (vocals/guitars), Kamil Poręba (guitars), Krzysztof Chomicki (vocals/bass) and Dawid Adamus (drums). In the summer of 2011 the band recorded a demo entitled 'Mental Disorder' consisting of three tracks (Mental, Odium Humani Generis, Vishe). The demo was released only in twenty copies of MC.

Finally in September 2011, after several months of schedule conflicts, Mind Affliction got its own rehearsal room and started having regular rehearsals. Within two months the band prepared for its first gig on 03.12.2011 in Pub Imbir in Cracow. During the whole year Mind Affliction played more than 15 gigs including a four day long support for the Show No Mercy Tour (United Mind Club, Ungrace), supporting the legendary Polish black metal band Christ Agony. Cooperation with other stars, such as Neolith, Banisher and ItSelf during the Covenant XIV gig, followed.

During the summer of 2012 the band entered 67 Studio in Giebułtów to record their first album under the watchful eye of Dominik Burzym. The session started in the last week of July and ended in the middle of August. The debut album 'Pathetic Humanity', consisting of 7 tracks, is being released by Metal Scrap Records in January 2013.
