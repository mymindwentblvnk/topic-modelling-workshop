Silent Lapse was formed in May of 2007 by brothers Mitchell and Taylor Feldpausch. The two recruited Matt Schrauben, Scott Martin, and Wyatt Aldrich to form a band whose main focus would be creating original music while pushing the members' creative and technical abilities. 

In 2009, the band released Birthright, their debut full-length album, mixed and mastered in Orebro, Sweden by Jens Bogren (Opeth, Katatonia, Soilwork).  In 2010, the band made the album available for free on their website, www.silentlapse.com. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Silent+Lapse">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
