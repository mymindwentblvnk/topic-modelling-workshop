Sunday's Best was an indie rock/emo band formed in Los Angeles, California in 1998.

The band's start came at KXLU, Loyola Marymount University's famous college radio station, where guitarist Ian Moreno, singer/bassist Ed Reyes, and drummer Tom Ackerman (formerly of Skiploader) all worked in the late '90s. 

Moreno and Reyes started the band with singer/guitarist Pedro Benito, a friend of Reyes's, and recorded the band's first seven-inch single in 1998, before recruiting Ackerman to play drums. 

In '99, they put out their first CDEP, the seven-song "Where You Are Now" and in 2000, they followed with their first LP, "Poised to Break" on Polyvinyl Records. 

2001 saw a slight line-up shift in the band - which saw the departure of founding member Pedro Benito (who left to join The Jealous Sound) and the addition of James Tweedy on bass guitar, with Edward Reyes stepping up to fill the guitar-void left by Benito.

Shortly thereafter, their sophomore effort "The Californian" appeared, showcasing the group's most perfect and clean pop sound yet.

Sunday's Best quietly dissolved in the summer of 2003. All involved band members moved on to other musical projects. Edward Reyes and Ian Moreno went on to form The Little Ones and self-released the "Sing Song" EP which was later re-released by Astralwerks after the band was formally signed. Tom Ackerman, who had been replaced earlier that year by San Diego indie-rock veteran Gabriel Gamboa (Kill Holiday, Lualta) joined the Los Angeles post-rock outfit Hyphen, who changed their name to the Kite Eating Tree and released "Method: Fail/Repeat" on Suburban Home Records. James Tweedy went on to form Los Angeles hardcore-punk outfit, The Bronx, who have released two self-titled full length albums and a handful of EP's.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sunday%27s+Best">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
