Wulfgar is a band that plays death metal in epic proportions with high influence from the Viking forefathers.

In the autumn of 2005, five guys came together to create metal history.
After throwing only a couple of gigs, Wulfgar ended up recording and releasing their first demo called "Hate for Mankind".
The demo was an immediate success and soon sold out.
The release also caused the gigs to start pouring in.
A group of devoted fans grew to a solid crowd. That's when the band started producing the second demo.
This demo was called "Wendigo". Soon after releasing the fresh tunes, Wulfgar's tunes conquered Kampas Records' ears causing a record deal being offered. The band could not ignore this offer and ended up, after some negotiations, signing the deal and making everything official.

Currently Wulfgar guys are producing a few killer tracks on their debut album, which will see the light of day during 2007.
Stay tuned!
