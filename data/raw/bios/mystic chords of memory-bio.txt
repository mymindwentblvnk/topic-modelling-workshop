Mystic Chords Of Memory are an American alternative rock band formed by sometime Tyde drummer and Beachwood Sparks frontman Christopher Gunst.

Frustrated by his time in Beachwood Sparks, Gunst quit music and enrolled at Graduate School to study teaching Special Education classes in late 2002.

It was not long before Gunst began recording song sketches in his home studio with partner Jen Cohen (formally of The Aislers Set) however, and Mystic Chords Of Memory were born.

The band released their self-titled debut album in 2004 with Ben Knight, Gunst's former bandmate in The Tyde, on guitar.
