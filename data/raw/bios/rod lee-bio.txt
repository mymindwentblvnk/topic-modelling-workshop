Rod Lee is a Baltimore DJ, producer, and party MC who is known for the popularization of Baltimore Club music. Described as "the original don of Baltimore Club" by The Washington Post, in 2005 he released "Vol. 5: the Official," a DJ mix that was the first Baltimore Club CD  to be distributed nationally.  His productions have contributed to the success of local stars like Bossman and Paula Campbell.  He is the founder and owner of the Club Kingz record label.[3]  and has independently released four mixtapes  that have circulated around the mid-Atlantic, but primarily within his native city of Baltimore.

Lee is highly popular among Baltimore club-goers and Baltimore Club music fans. Because the city and surrounding area of Baltimore does not have a highly developed urban music scene, he is currently considered one of the most notable artists to represent the city.

His song "Dance My Pain Away" was featured on the soundtrack to the HBO series The Wire. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rod+Lee">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
