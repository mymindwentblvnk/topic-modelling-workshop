S.O.S. Band is an American funk / soul musical ensemble, founded in Atlanta, Georgia, USA in 1977. The "SOS" acronym stands not for "Save Our Souls", but for "Sounds of Success".

The band, fronted by Mary Davis, was initially famous for the post-disco hit "Take Your Time (Do It Right)" in 1979. In 1982, they joined forces with then-new production team Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis, who went on to craft a string of R&B hits for the group, including "Just Be Good to Me", "Tell Me If You Still Care", "Feeling", and "Borrowed Love".

The Jam/Lewis produced SOS Band hits are notable for popularizing the use of the Roland TR-808 drum machine (and its distinctive cowbell sound) in popular music. The group continues to tour and perform to this day.

In "The Finest" the male singer is no other than Alexander O'Neal. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/S.O.S.+Band">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
