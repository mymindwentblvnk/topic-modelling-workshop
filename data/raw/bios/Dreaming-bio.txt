Dreaming is a traditional Doom metal band from Zschopau, Germany in the vein of St. Vitus or perhaps Witchfinder General, but with a slightly more positive feel to it; heavy riffing and slighty "hollow sounding" melodramatic clean vocals with some tendencies towards stoner.
Founded in summer 1993, they gave their first concert in 1994.
The current line-up consists of Sandro Uhlmann (guitars, vocals), Thomas Becker (drums) and Thomas Schulz (bass, vocals).

The demo "Smirten Prøben" was released in 1994 with  200 copies sold and is now available for download here.
They've done a lot of gigs with bands like Naevus, Mirror of Deception, Dawn of Winter, Solitude Aeturnus, Morgana Lefay amongst others.

In fall/winter 1998 recording sessions for the first full album "Tý Vølœý" were started, which
has been released on October 1st 1999.

Further shows in 2000/2001 with Solstice, The Lord Weird Slough Feg, Warning and Jack Frost.

In spring 2001 a new song from the forthcoming album has been released on the "Psychedelic" compilation and  “The Warstarter” was recorded for the "St. Vitus Tribute" on RavenMoonRecords.
In 2003 they played at the first European Doom festival "Doom Shall Rise"  and in 2004 at the "Autumn of Doom Festival" with Reverend Bizarre, Officium Triste, Mirror Of Deception, Jack Frost, Rise and Shine and Whispering Gallery.

Their latest full-length album is simply called "II" and saw light of day in 2006.
