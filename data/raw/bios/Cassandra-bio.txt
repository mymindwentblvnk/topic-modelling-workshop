Cassandra is a duo formed in early 2014 in the city of Curitiba by Daniel Silveira (bass and voice) and Karina D'Alessandre (Drums). Cassandra is inspired by the character from Greek mythology who predicted tragedies after being cursed and finally dying like mad. Among the few influences, it passes through Sludge and Post-Metal, creating a dense and heavy experimental sound, always sung in Portuguese. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cassandra">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
