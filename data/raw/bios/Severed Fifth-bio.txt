Severed Fifth is a music project designed to explore how far a musician can take his music with the new economics of the music industry. The brain-child of Jono Bacon, Severed Fifth is an ambitious musical project, both with Jono's demanding performances of all of the instruments, vocals, and production, but also by creating a community of listeners who can share, remix, and otherwise benefit from the music. Severed Fifth's first album, "Denied By Reign" is a brutal 8 track solo-effort, bringing to mind the likes of Hatebreed and Decapitated. The album is available as a free download under the Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike license at the official web site, in MP3 and OGG audio format.

Jono Bacon by day is the Community manager for Canonical's Ubuntu   project, a known Linux Distribution. He is a well-known public speaker, and was one of the four co-hosts of the wildly popular Lugradio podcast. By night, Jono was formerly part of the band Seraphidian, taking on vocal and guitar duties from the previous bands Conspiracy and Neuraxon.
