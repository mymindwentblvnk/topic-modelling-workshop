In 2004 a few guys from North Canton got together to write and play some heavy music and started a band called Elysium. With a lot of time and energy we developed an intense set of songs and played live quite a bit in North Canton, Ohio and the surrounding area. We had some great times and started recording a record in 2005. However, in 2006 when the album was almost complete, the band parted ways and the record was never released due to the absence of incoming finance and lost files. Nine years later a few of the guys started kicking around the idea of finally putting the material out and set out to record at Brainchild Studios in Cleveland, Ohio with Noah Buchanan. Through the years several other bands have performed under the band name Elysium, so we have adapted to the times and evolved into Reclaiming Elysium. With the help of some of the areas finest musicians we have finally recorded the material and are set to release the decade old album in May of 2016.
From 2004 to 2006 a group of guys incorporated elements of Lamb of God, In Flames, At the Gates, The Haunted, Soilwork, Darkest Hour, Trivium, All That Remains, Killswitch Engage, Between the Buried and Me, The Black Dahlia Murder, and Metallica and wrote the material that we are finally releasing a decade later.
