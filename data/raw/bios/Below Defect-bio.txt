Below Defect are five talented young men thrashing their way onto the Southampton metal scene in the UK. Their debut album, Eagle Eyed Generation, is due for release in september 2011 and promises to deliver their own personal brand of 'thrash metal with bare harmonies' in swathes. As the title track single suggests Below Defect's sound is home to crushing riffs and fiery solos with an added dose of well crafted melody. As the group gouge out their place in contemporary metal they do so with determination to always play with a qualtiy and passion beyond most others.

"The band offer some impressive fast thrash-paced work reminiscent of Metallica and Slayer with interesting shifts and great atmospheric textures." Tom Willmott - Amped Reviews Dot Net

"Aggression, mechanical and anger, all bought together with a sense of the earths final judgement. Eagle Eyed Generation brings the war and chaos that Metal is known for with the force of a Nuclear warhead. TP Rating - 7/10" Matt Callanan - Turbulence Promotions
