Violet was born in 1995 in Sao Paulo, Brazil.

Violet started singing even before she knew how to talk. Hey mother was always incredibly supportive, and she was the one who introduced Violet to music. Violet must have been around three or four years old, but she distinctly remembers listening to Heal the World by Michael Jackson on her vinyl player while her mother and Violet danced around the living room. Violet's childhood was the ignition of my love for music.

During my teenage years, Violet started taking singing and guitar lessons and fell in love with rock music. She had a multitude of different bands and projects where I developed my identity as a singer-songwriter. When Violet graduated high school, she went to study abroad In London and lived there for 5 years, ultimately getting a degree in songwriting.

She has since moved back to her home country, but she travel back and forth to the United States and has plans to move to there.

Right now, Violet is a full-time musician, YouTuber, songwriter and producer. She release's covers every week of songs she loves (mainly rock songs), I’ve written music for films and produces her own original material.

She is open to all collaborations, productions and performances. Please see her contact page and feel free to email her! She can’t promise she'll accept all offers, but she can guarantee a response.

Music is a strange and wonderful thing that she can’t live without, and she is fortunate enough to be able to share it with you. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Violet+Orlandi">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
