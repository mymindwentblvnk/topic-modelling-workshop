The Homosexuals were an influential British punk band formed in 1977 as The Rejects by Bruno McQuillan (a.k.a. Bruno Wizard), Anton Hayman, and Jim Welton (who has also recorded under the names L. Voag, Amos, and Xentos).

Their angular guitars, complex melodies, and experimental leanings distanced them somewhat from the punk rock being created by their contemporaries and made them a definite precursor to post-punk. They released very little during their lifetime, and most of what they did release was on small run vinyl on obscure record labels. The members also recorded in various combinations under several different pseudonyms. These "side projects" include Ici La Bas, Sir Alick & The Phraser, George Harrasment and L. Voag. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Homosexuals">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
