Virvel Av Morkerhatet was formed in the middle of 2003 under the name 'Den Of Winter'. In 2004, demo was released, "Sorrow of Ice", and after that in 2006, an EP, titled "Haze". The band participated in "Carpathian Might" (Ukrainian Black Metal compilation) with song 'Furiousness of the Ascending Moon' in 2006. After some live shows in 2006-2007, the band was finishing live sessions on independent time, and changed the name to Virvel Av Morkerhatet. At this time, the band was complete and the first full-length album, 'Forsaken Hate Sickness', was released on Hellspell Productions with very limited edition (July 2010). Virvel Av Morkerhatet is preparing for more live assaults and is working with material for the second album. 100 hand-numbered copies of 'Forsaken Hate Sickness' will be released by Forbidden Records December 21st, 2010.
