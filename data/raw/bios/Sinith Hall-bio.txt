Sinith Hall was formed in spring 2009. The band consists of five members who draw influence from just about every form of music. The idea behind Sinith Hall was to create a colorfully unique metal style with strong instrumental prowess and virtuosity. Sinith Hall merges both clean and heavier vocals through a shred-progressive style. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sinith+Hall">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
