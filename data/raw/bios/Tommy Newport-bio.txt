Born in Manchester, England and raised in Wichita, Kansas, Tommy Newport began playing guitar as an escape from teenage boredom. His EP "Ultra Mango" offers six varied tracks, all coming together to tell a lighthearted story of wistful youth. A follow-up to his 2018 debut "Just Be Ironic", "Ultra Mango" is a surprisingly deep and soulful experience with a distinctive far-out, retro feel. Producer 4th Pyramid explains: “The idea here was to take that DIY basement nostalgia feel and make records that knock as hard as today’s biggest smashes. We’ve been able to carve out our own planet with "Ultra Mango".”  They’ve succeeded. And we love it. 

Tommy’s music has already been featured on a number of TV shows, like HBO’s Ballers, Netflix’s original series What/If, TBS’ Search Party, Amy Schumer’s documentary Expecting Amy, and The Sinner, and he’s also scored the latest ad campaign for Apple’s iPad. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tommy+Newport">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
