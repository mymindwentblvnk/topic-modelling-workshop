Insidius Infernus is a Melodic Black Metal band from Athens, Greece. The band was formed in the year of 2000, releasing 2 albums after they split up in 2004. 

Their two albums were released under Sleaszy Rider, both of which lyrically - relate to fictional fantasy, in landscapes such as winter and night. The first album released in 2002 was called "Pale Grieving Moon" and the second one "Eyes In Astral Abyss" was released in 2004, prior to them quitting. 

The band features two members; Ungod, whom did all the instruments and vocals except for the female vocals - done by Luciferia. Both later decided to work in the same fields in their other bands.

The reason why the band quit and lacked such a small lineup was because Ungod and Luciferia decided this would be a side-project only temporarily. Ungod worked with small Hellenic Black Metal acts such as Sad, Nargothrond, and Necrohell. He too, did all of the instruments in those projects and released very little albums. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Insidius+Infernus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
