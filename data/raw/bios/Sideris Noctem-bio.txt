Sideris Noctem was formed in year 2001 in Poltava. Band members of that period were: Valentin – guitar; Mikhail – guitar; Eugene - bass; Vitaliy – vocals; Roman – drums. Later Ekaterina joined the band on back vocals. After several months band played 30 minutes of quality Doom metal on their first concert in Poltava. In 2002 band recorded their first demo, called The Path To Novel Phenomenon. It includes 6 Doom-death metal compositions and cover version of Katatonia’s song Without God. By the reason of Roman’s military service some changes took place in the band. Mikhail took vacant places of vocalist and Vitaliy became drummer.

  With this line-up Sideris Noctem played one more concert, After which Vitaliy went to army and band took pause in their activities. Mikhail and Eugene also left the band. Finally from the first line-up only Valentin stayed in the band.In 2006 Sideris Noctem changed its location and became Kherson band. After a year of working the new line-up was completed and demo composition Lost in Debris of Past was recorded.
