Daemongrinder is a Christian death metal solo project by James Kline. The "band" was created in 1997 after the break-up of James' first band, Big Orange Torpedo. Deviating from his punk roots, James initially envisioned Daemongrinder as a fusion of death metal and industrial, but decided to take the sound into more or less straight death metal territory.

In 2002, Daemongrinder self-released an eight song demo, entitled Inhuman Acts of Brutality to rather dismal reviews. James was not at all surprised though, due to the poor sound quality of the demo. (Inhuman Acts of Brutality was recorded very crudely on a digital 4-track recorder, an analog 4-track, and utilized MIDI programmed drums & bass guitar tracks.)

After two ill-fated attempts to record a follow-up to the demo, and a serious crisis of faith, James pulled the proverbial plug on Daemongrinder in 2006.

With his crisis of faith resolved, a new perspective on life, and a new home recording studio, James has resurrected the project once more and has begun recording a brand new Daemongrinder CD. (As of June 2009 the CD has yet to be named.) The first track recorded for the upcoming album, a song entitled "Morbid Obsession", has been described by James as 'sonically superior to any of the songs on Inhuman Acts of Brutality'.

Daemongrinder is musically influenced by: Dream Theater, Misfits, Extol, Crimson Thorn, Mortification, Living Sacrifice, Cannibal Corpse, etc. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Daemongrinder">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
