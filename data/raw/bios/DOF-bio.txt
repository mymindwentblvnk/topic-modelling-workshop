DoF is Brian Hulick, born in Pennsylvania. He started releasing his music in 2002 and it has only improved since. An array of Strings and Pianos complimented by oddly pleasing rhythms of cut up organic and synthetic drum beats, venture in very unique ways amongst his collection. The album Mine is May (2004) is considered among his best and features artwork by Matt Garrett.
