Oratory was founded in 1994 by guitarist Miguel Gomes and vocalist Marco Alves. After the band recorded two demos, Enchantation and Sarcastic Soul, the band went through line-up changes, ending up with Ana Lara (vocals), Marco Alves (vocals), Miguel Gomes (guitars), Rui Santos (bass), Jo찾o Rodrigues (drums), and Antonio Silva (keyboards). With this line-up, Oratory played with other Portuguese bands, such as Tarantula, and opened for Stratovarius.

In 1999 Oratory signed to the Portuguese record label Recital, and released a four song EP called Last Prophecy. In March and May 2000, Oratory and producer Luis Barros recorded Oratory's debut album Illusion Dimensions. "The readers of the Portuguese magazines, "Loud!" and "Riff" voted Oratory Best Newcomer of the Year," following the release. "This was followed by shows playing with Tarantula, Edguy and Metalium."

Vocalist Marco Alves left in February 2001 and the band continued with Ana as the main vocalist. In January 2002, Oratory re-entered the recording studio to record their second album, Beyond Earth, with producer Uwe Lulis. Beyond Earth was released in Portugal on the 20th of May, 2002; December 2, 2002 in Europe, and February 2003 in the US.

In 2004, drummer Jo찾o Rodrigues left the band due to personal reasons, and was replaced by Pedro Cabral, a former Oratory member.
