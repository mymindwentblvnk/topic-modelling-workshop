Black/death metal from Czech Republic. Members are Infernal Vlad (Vocals, Guitars, Bass) and Tom Coroner (Drums) from Cult of Fire.

Band started in 2013 with an EP "A Life Not Worth Living". This was positively humbled by Death Karma's debut album, The History of Death & Burial Rituals part 1 released early 2015. This album showed a mix of black and death metal, but was so much more: ambitious, varied, progressive, mysterious and overwhelmingly dark in its atmosphere. As described by the label (Iron Bonehead Productions): kaleidoscopic kind of black metal, bolstered by death metal muscle, surging-yet-layered songcraft, mystical melodicism, and a robust production that highlights every subtle nuance, every dynamic twist, and especially the over-spilling violence. It's an album that not so much abandons black/death in futile favor of something "different" for its own sake, but rather attempts - and succeeds, massively - to inject bold adventure into classicist purity. 

The band's creative force Infernal Vlad views this debut release as "the first part of the musicalization of posthumous rituals and the perception of death in different cultures and countries around the world".

The History of Death & Burial Rituals part 1 is released both as an LP and digital release. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Death+Karma">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
