From his days DJing and throwing underground break-ins for over a decade in the late 80's - early 90's rave scene in his native San Francisco, to a life of seclusion within the ancient walls of Shaoxing China, where he until recently called home, Brock Van Wey, aka bvdub, has lived and breathed electronic music for nearly 22 years. 

Beginning his own production forays in 2006, his overtly emotional and hypnotic sound spread quickly through releases on Styrax, Meanwhile, and his own Quietus imprint, before further honing his trademark sound into one that has given rise to an army of albums on Home Normal, Echospace (detroit), Darla, Glacial Movements, and many more, as well as becoming a regular three years' running on Kompaktâ€™s legendary Pop Ambient series. 

Blurring the lines between ambient, deep techno, deep house, abstract, IDM, and everything in-between, bvdub's music defies the concept of genres, and seeks only to speak from the heart.

Brock has also released music under his given name, Brock Van Wey, as Earth House Hold (deep house), and East of Oceans (drum&bass).   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bvdub">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
