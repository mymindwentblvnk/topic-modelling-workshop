Kepler was an Ottawa-based Canadian post-rock band started in 1996. The band had many different members over the course of its existence, including Jeremy Gara, Samir Khan, Jon Georgekish-Watt, Mike Sheridan, Michael Feuerstack, Mike Dubue, and Jordy Walker (as well as a variety of guest musicians).

Kepler initially garnered attention for its exceptionally slow and quiet sound, reminiscent of groups such as Low, Codeine, and Bedhead. The band toured across Canada, the United States, and Europe, once opening for Montreal's Godspeed You! Black Emperor in the United Kingdom. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kepler">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
