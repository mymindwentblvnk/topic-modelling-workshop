There is more than one artist with this name:

1. Archaea are a swedish metal band from Gothenburg, formed in February 2007 by brothers Markus and Hannes Heidarsson. They had left their earlier band to go their own way and create own music. 

The current form of Archaea ranges from crushing darkness to brilliant melody, with sharp contrasts and fluently shifting dynamics, with inspiration from all over the metal spectrum. The lyrical themes describe struggles on a personal and global scale, elusive antagonists and the unyielding indifference of the elements. Yet through the hardship and agony depicted, mankind may yet see the distant light of a new day.

After an arduous recording process in their homemade studio, their debut album Catalyst was unleashed upon the world in 2015 to a very positive reception.

Archaea consists of:
Hannes Heidarsson - Keyboards
Markus Heidarsson - Guitars
Nils Bossius Klintenberg - Vocals
Richard Mikulasi - Bass
Alexander Molnar - Drums

2. Stoner/sludge/doom metal from Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States
