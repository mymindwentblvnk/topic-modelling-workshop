Since moving to NYC in late 06 Appomattox have constantly challenged the limitations of the Rock Trio; getting mesmerizing, effected tones out of their instruments & juxtaposing complex harmony with - for lack of a better word - some Really Fun Rhythms. All packed inside consistently addictive 2-minute songs comprised of brutally simple melody & razor-sharp message. "Sweaty, distorted, political, pop-hooks echo." [-Appomattox forced to describe their own sound in 6 words] Their new, self-released, [semi-] eponymous EP "Appmttx" -the title is a play on the spelling of their name that the band & its fans often use as shorthand- is no exception. Singer/guitarist Nick Gaynier's lyrics express sincere outrage at the state of our politics, media & income distribution and his vox are delivered in a punk tenor that is pure Rock n Roll. Gaynier's guitar is classic-sounding & cutting; and the rhythm section of Dave Nurmi on bass & James Mello on drums is warm & propulsive. The parts seem smartly composed to make you want to move as you soak in the song.
