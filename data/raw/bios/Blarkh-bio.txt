Blarkh is a one man folk-, black-, death- and orchestral-metal band from Finland. (www.myspace.com/blarkh)

Blarkh was formed in summer 2009 when it recorded its first album, 4-song EP Sceneries from Arcane Woods. It was uploaded to MySpace in November 2009 but it didn't gain as much success as the second album SMRMMRS which was released on 22/01/2010. It gained a lot more listenings and brought Blarkh a bunch of fans mostly because the album had more professional, grown up sounds and more earthy lyrics.

The frontman Blarkh writes the lyrics and music to his songs, plays them and even records, mixes and masters them. All the songs have been recorded in his homestudio (Blarkh's Lair Studios)  if not else mentioned. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Blarkh">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
