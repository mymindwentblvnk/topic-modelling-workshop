Since January 2009 MadNine changed their name to Procez.

MadNine was formed in 2005 in Gdansk, Poland by Adam Murawski. He wanted to play loud  hard rock music. Drummer Grzegorz Jaszczurowski and vocalist Wojtek Skarżyński all had the same goal. They were quickly joined by rythm guitarist Mateusz Eckert and bass player Marek Rocławski. The first studio demo ep Home (http://www.last.fm/music/MadNine/Home+ep+(2005) ) containing three songs was recorded in 06/2006 and first gigs soon followed. Later that year a proper demo called Hope ( http://www.last.fm/music/MadNine/Hope ) was recorded, and released in early 2007 on the web. 2007 was marked by touring northern Poland , and achieving 2nd place at May Rock Festival in Skierniewice. In 09/2007 MadNine played at Open Air Rock Festival along bands like Mech and Myslovitz. The gig was professionaly recorded, and two of the songs were released as live sp ( http://www.last.fm/music/MadNine/Live+Open+Air+Rock+Fest+2007+sp ).
