Brandy, the founding member, first brought Empusa to life early in 2006. And shortly after the first songs started appearing and being heard around Myspace, she met Richie, the man behind Black Swan Insurgency, the Dutch industrial protest band. Brandy and Richie straight away started collaborating on music, and in November of 2006, Richie officially joined Empusa as a fully fledged member to form the band you hear today. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Empusa">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
