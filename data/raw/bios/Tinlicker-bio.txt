Utrecht based duo Micha Heyboer and Jordi van Achthoven have been crafting their computerized soul together since 2013. And even during those early days they were no rookies, having individually honed their skills as part of world renowned drum 'n bass act Black Sun Empire (Heyboer) and as producer, songwriter and music editor for many artists (Van Achthoven).

All this previous experience showed from day one, resulting in an impressive string of highly mature and deeply emotive tracks. Since starting working together they’ve quickly become a household name in the world of electronic dance music with releases on labels such as Anjunadeep, mau5trap and Armada.

Jordi and Micha’s productions like their song 'Because You Move Me' or dancefloor anthems 'Lost' and 'Less Than A Minute' have racked up millions of streams. Their reworks of Robert Miles, deadmau5, James Zabiela and Reflekt’s iconic ’Need To Feel Loved’ together with their collabs with Ben Böhmer, Lane 8 and Helsloot have become indispensable ingredients for the world’s biggest radio and DJ shows.

The best comprehensive insight into the Tinlicker sound, their first full length artist album This Is Not Our Universe, featuring vocals by alt-J, Run Rivers and Thomas Oliver, was released in fall 2019. The album features heartfelt songwriting, wistful house grooves and vibrant progressive interludes - a showcase for two innovative producers operating in the frontline of modern dance music.
