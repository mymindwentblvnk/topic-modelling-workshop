This Southern California band captures the spirit of Dark Tranquility like no other American act, but their textures go beyond. A patina of sophistication makes all of the band's songs shine, aided by rich production, varied vocals, kick ass drumming, and keyboard textures. Dark Haven will no doubt be signed very soon. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dark+Haven">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
