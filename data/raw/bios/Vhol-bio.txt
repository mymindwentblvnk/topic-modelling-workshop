VHÖL is group comprised of vocalist Mike Scheidt (of YOB), guitarist John Cobbett (of Hammers of Misfortune), drummer Aesop Dekker (of Agalloch), and bassist Sigrid Sheie (also of Hammers of Misfortune).

Initially formed by Cobbett and Dekker to create music together again post-Ludicra;  the initial intention was to write music of a faster nature by combining elements of old-school punk, d-beat hardcore, classic old-school metal (a good combination of traditional classic metal ala Judas Priest and speed metal in the “Kill ‘Em All”/”Show No Mercy” vein), and a touch of outsider black metal. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/VHOL">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
