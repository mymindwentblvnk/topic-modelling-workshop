Phantom-X is an American metal band. The band was formed in Dallas, Texas in 2004 by then Omen singer, Kevin Goocher and Glenn Malicki. Kevin Goocher and Glenn Malicki had been playing together around their hometown in a Ronnie James Dio tribute band, Stargazer, for fun. When Omen took a 2 year hiatus, Goocher and Malicki decided to turn the Stargazer project into what is now Phantom-X.

In 2005, Phantom-X signed to Mausoleum Records and released their debut album "Rise of the Phantom". The album became number 7 on the German metal charts Heavy. "Rise of the Phantom" includes the first chapters of a story that Phantom-X is now known for telling on their albums. Followed by the release of this album, Phantom-X was asked to tour with Canadian metal band Anvil. The tour was documented and ended up being used for the movie "The Story Of Anvil".

In 2006, Phantom-X released the follow up album "Storm Riders", also through Mausoleum Records. After the release of this album, Kevin Goocher and Glenn Malicki parted ways with then drummer and guitarist.

During this time, Kevin Goocher and his daughter Devon Goocher signed on to tape a show for VH1 with Danny Bonaduce called "I Know My Kids A Star". The show aired for one season.

After searching for the right replacements for Phantom-X for two year, they connected with Bill Engfer and Reece Stanley who became an intricate part of what Goocher and Malicki said the band was missing.

In 2010, Phantom-X released "This Is War" to much acclaim. This album allowed the band their first headling tour. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Phantom-X">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
