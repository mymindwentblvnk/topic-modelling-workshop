Chaos Panic & Disorder - the most aptly named band ever - live up to their name onstage and off! Since 2004, this band has been pushing the bounds of metal with their "Groove or Die" philosophy.  CP&D created a sound that whips crowds into frenzy, or stops them dead in their tracks, serving up metal pure and simple, no prefixes, suffixes or hyphenations. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Chaos+Panic+&+Disorder">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
