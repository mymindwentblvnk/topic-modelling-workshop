"Morvidus is the one man musical project of Nathaniel Tye, which was begun in late 2012.

The music and lyrics are inspired by art and literature, particularly by the Romantic movement.

Morvidus' name comes from a legendary king of Britain as described by Geoffrey of Monmouth in the 'Historia Regum Britanniae' (History of the Kings of Britain)." - From the Mordivus Bandcamp page. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Morvidus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
