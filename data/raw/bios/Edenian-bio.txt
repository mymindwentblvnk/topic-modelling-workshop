The band was formed in Kharkov, Ukraine in 2010, under the great influence of such bands as: Draconian, Doom:VS, Swallow The Sun, Saturnus, Katatonia and early stuff of Tristania, Sirenia and Xandria.
Firstly, the band carried the name Eternia, but for some reasons the name was changed to Edenian.
Over the next months, the newborn band worked hard on the material that was included to their first full-length album “Winter Shades”. The album was released on May 28, 2012 through the BadMoodMan Music (Solitude Productions sub-label). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Edenian">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
