The Past
Early 2004, Blind Sight released its first EP Lies in Conviction. During the following period of time, they played all the big venues in the Netherlands, hosted a radio show for the famous Dutch Kink FM Radio and played with numerous leading bands like Avenged Sevenfold, Within Temptation and more.

The Present
After a change in line-up late 2004, the band has been on a roll. March 2006 Blind Sight released their debut album "The Tenderstrike Salvation" after signing a record deal with GSR Music (known from bands like Born From Pain, Madball, Knuckle Dust, etc). As a full service band the production and the artwork of the album where done by the band itself. The album was extremely well received with nothing other than positive reviews by the national as well as the international media.
In the following period of time Blind Sight signed a endorsement deal with ESP & Tech21, played with bands like Machine Head, Hatebreed, Agnostic Front, Madball, Caliban, Darkest Hour, Cephalic Carnage, Born From Pain, Evergreen Terrace and toured trough Europe with the American band The Black Dahlia Murder. They played in countries like Spain, Portugal, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, France, Germany and Belgium. To promote their debut album "The Tenderstrike Salvation" more tours are being planned for the oncoming period to tour even more European countries and eventually the whole world.
