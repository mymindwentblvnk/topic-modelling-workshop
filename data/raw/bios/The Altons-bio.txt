The Altons have been active around town for the last couple of years, quickly becoming known for vibrantly encapsulating the essence of a Los Angeles that exists because of its raspy, strikingly honest, genre bending forbears. Their sound is soulful blues with a sun tan and sweet backyard cumbia tinnitus. It's a sound that's graced stages from Viva Pomona to Echo Park Rising, and has local audiences swooning to say the least.

The Altons, all from Los Angeles with roots all over space and time, don't shy away from the experience of growing up at a cultural crossroads in fact, they welcome it- both in their sound at at their live shows. In The Meantime is an album made with love for where they came from and a bold step forward for the new generation coming out of Southeast Los Angeles. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Altons">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
