Killing Culture was formed in Los Angeles, CA, by vocalist Marcus Payton, guitarist Scott Sargeant (who had previously worked with Laaz Rockit and M.O.D.), bassist Paul Puljiz, and drummer Pat Magrath, and as well as being managed by S.O.D./M.O.D. main man Billy Milano, their eponymous 1997 debut album was produced by none other than Anthrax's Scott Ian. Unfortunately, the record's hardcore-infused brand of post-thrash still left much to be desired, and received very little support from their resource-strapped indie label, Edel, resulting in Killing Culture's speedy demise, when Sargeant accepted a new position with Skinlab, while McGrath hooked up with Prototype and later Steel Prophet. ~ Eduardo Rivadavia, All Music Guide <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Killing+Culture">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
