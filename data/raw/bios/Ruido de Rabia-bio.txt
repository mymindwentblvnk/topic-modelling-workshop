GRINDCORE from the village of Tolosa, Basque  Country (Spain). They started in 1985 as a punk band with lyrics totally politics, similar to the brittish band CRASS. After some members changed the band became in RUIDO DE RABIA and made an old-school grindcore with some hardcore touch. Is in 1993 with their third album "Revolucion Cosmica" when its sound got influences from styles such as: industrial, death metal or thrash. But the lyrics, artwork and general aesthetics continued with the CRASS style. The band disbanded in 1994.
