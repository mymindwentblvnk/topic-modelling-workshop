Blackfeather was an Australian band founded in 1970 and led for most of its ten-year existence by singer Neale Johns. It began as a progressive rock unit, which can be heard on Mountains of Madness (1971), but later moved toward a simpler rock & roll style, resulting in the Australian #1 hit "Boppin' the Blues" and the 1974 Live album. The group's personnel was fluid in the second half of the '70s, especially after Johns moved to the U.K. to form Fingerprint. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Blackfeather">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
