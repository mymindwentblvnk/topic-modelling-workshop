There are multiple artists with this name:

1. Orodruin is an American Doom Metal band.  The band was founded by guitarist John Gallo in 1998 in Rochester, NY alongside friends Mike Puleo (vocals and bass) and Nick Tydelski (guitar). The band plays original Doom under the influence of Trouble, Saint Vitus, early Cathedral, Candlemass, Pentagram, and Witchfinder General.

Their first demo was released in 1999. In 2001 they recruited Mike Waske on drums and recorded their debut album, "Epicurean Mass", which was officially released on Austrian label psycheDOOMelic Records in 2003. The album received great enthusiastic feedback within the doom metal scene and quickly landed them a spot on the US Doomination tour alongside Mourning Beloveth, and The Prophecy. Later that year they released a split 12" with Reverend Bizarre through Hellride Music. In 2004 they toured Europe with doom metal veterans, Penance, where they premiered at the Doom Shall Rise II festival. They released an exclusive tour EP entitled "Clawtower" also on psycheDOOMelic Records.
