2. Enchantress is a new heavy metal/hard rock influenced band who was born as a brainchild of guitarist Fred Kidey and Tim N. there was a strong need to upgrade the recreative jamming project to the real stuff and after some time asking around without progress they finaly found a drummer: Eliza was very enthousiastic and from then aggreed to supply an appropriate dose of drums. the quest for a bass player was still not finished and they needed a singer aswell. a friend of Eliza was prepared to do the bass and the singing, but after some time she left because the music wasn't really her direction. luckily 2 fellows of VEMPIRE were prepared to fill up the missing jobs. They were more than happy welcoming sven to take over the bass and jochen to do the vocal work. Finally Enchantress has incarnated with a decent line-up and is ready to bring back the typical 80's sound. now they're working hard on their first demo! 

they have 1 demo song circulating, named Paralyzed
