Musicians, DJs, and go-to producers known for mesmerizing funk and neo-disco, Holy Ghost! (aka the NYC-based duo of Alex Frankel and Nicholas Millhiser) have released two critically acclaimed albums, 2011’s self-titled debut and 2013’s Dynamics, on DFA Records. A remix album, 2015’s self-released Work For Hire also generated wide praise. Holy Ghost! have performed on Jimmy Kimmel Live! and The Late Show with David Letterman, toured with New Order, played at renowned festivals such as Coachella, Outside Lands, Primavera, and Bonnaroo, and remixed for Katy Perry, LCD Soundsystem, Moby, and more.

Holy Ghost!’s most recent release, 2015’s remix alum Work for Hire, was a mesmerizing time capsule of remixes that boldly traced the group’s aesthetic from their nascent days dabbling in groove to radical rethinkings of songs. It was, in certain ways, a necessary stepping stone to Crime Cutz. “Work for Hire was a good breather from working on original music,” Alex says. “It was a good way to get back into the studio. There’s a lot of pressure when you’re writing original stuff. We were able to focus more on groove and arrangement, rather than trying to write formative pop songs.”
 
The objective, Nick says of the forthcoming collection, was singular: “Aesthetically, Alex and I were musically, melodically trying to do so“ Some artists make music really rapidly—they put out mixtapes on SoundCloud, like, every few months,” Alex Frankel ruminates. Of course, Frankel and his Holy Ghost! bandmate Nick Millhiser do not fall into that category. “We’re so envious of that.”  They’re again adding to their dance repertoire with the vibrant Crime Cutz EP out later this year on DFA Records.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Holy+Ghost%21">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
