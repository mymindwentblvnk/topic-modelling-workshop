ODESZA is a production duo made up of Harrison Mills (Catacombkid) and Clayton Knight (BeachesBeaches) based out of the Pacific Northwest, United States. They met their senior year of college and decided to spend the summer as recent graduates from Western Washington University in Bellingham, WA collaborating on an album. On September 5th, 2012 they self-released a free LP entitled “Summer’s Gone”, creating a delicate balance between dreamy sun trickled melodies, glitched out vocals, crunchy drums and large sweeping basslines.

After the release of their first album, the duo released their debut EP, My Friends Never Die in 2013. In 2014, their sophomore release, In Return, dropped and took the world by storm. A remix by RAC of the lead single, Say My Name, earned the duo their first Grammy Nomination (for Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical) at the 58th Grammy Awards.

Their third studio album, A Moment Apart, was released on September 8, 2017. Peaking at the Billboard 200 at #3 while at the same time topping the Top Electronic/Dance Albums Chart, the duo were reaching newfound success. A Moment Apart was nominated for Best Dance/Electronic Album, with it's lead single ("Line of Sight") being nominated for Best Dance Recording, at the 60th Grammy Awards in 2018. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Odesza">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
