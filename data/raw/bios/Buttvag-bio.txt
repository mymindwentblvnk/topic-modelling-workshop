ButtVag was formed in 2006 by Evil Lolicon and Harry Sinn mainly to make fun of people they knew and to pay Homage to Anal Cunt by playing similar styled Grindcore. Recorded the first demo in 2006 on a handheld tape recorder Evil Lolicon was using for college lectures, all you were able to hear was random screams and the cymbal crashing the whole time and laughing in between songs. Time went by without any practices and recording until late 2007 and then mid 2008 when Evil Lolicon recorded a bulk of the ButtVag discography himself in his room studio. Everything past the first demo was more along the lines of Grind/Death/Noise than just simple Grindcore. Another long while passed and then Harry Sinn and Evil Lolicon practiced and changed the name to Youkai.

Everything past "Morbid Bulldozer of Satan" is Youkai. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Buttvag">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
