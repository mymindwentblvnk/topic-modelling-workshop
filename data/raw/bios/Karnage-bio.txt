1)Karnage is a French 80’s punk band. Their punk is rather glacial (cold-punk) and lyrics, although sometimes simplistic, are very dark and revolted. Rhythm is made either by a drummer, or by a drum machine. Karnage records its first 4 titles demo " Planète poubelle " in 1982. Then with their first and only vinyl, " Total terminus " EP in 84, they import all archetype of the anarchopunk appreciates across the channel : black and white sleeve with poster on all reverse side, complete autoproduction and even quotes of Kropotkine!! Criticisms are rather flattering, they compare them with Crass. Second demo " Autorités finales " released in 85 and includes 11 titles live and studio recorded between 82 and 85. But the band gets breathless in spite of a participation in an international compilation  LP and split in 86, having however slipped unreleased titles here and there, particularly for a local compilation K7 .
