Cavus was started around 07/08 by the founding fathers J.K & T.T.T. They gave birth to this demon of hatred and devilry to serve them, loyally and unquestioning, through times of violent intoxication and the depths of depravity. Soon after that, W was summoned to spit his spells on the beast, and A.R.G to teach it his earth-trembling juggernautics.

The first offspring of this alliance is a self titled EP, consisting of four hymns in the honour of plague and pestilence, lasting just under 17 minutes. Cavus is now embarking on their conquest of the lands, pillaging and deconsecrating everything and everyone in reach of hand, leaving a trail of madness behind them. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cavus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
