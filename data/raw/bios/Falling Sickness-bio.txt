Falling Sickness was a Riverside, California based Punk Rock band, consisting of Fritz Aragon (vocals, guitar), Zach (vocals, bass), Gabe Gil (vocals), and Angel Ieven (drums). After six years of being an unsigned band and playing mostly local shows, Falling Sickness were signed to Hopeless Records in 1995. Their debut record Right On Time was released soon after in January of 1996. The record which chronicled the first six years of the band is "about drinking, daydreaming and fucking up; a testament of our youth. After all, when we started [Gabe] was only 17 and Fritz was 14".[1] Their next, and final, record as a band, Because the World Has Failed Us Both was released in February of 1998 also on Hopeless Records. 'Because the World Has Failed Us Both' is "about our growing up" and focuses more on worldly politics rather than the teenage politics of 'Right On Time'. In 2000, Falling Sickness disbanded. Since then, Fritz and Angel have formed the band Dogs of Ire. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Falling+Sickness">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
