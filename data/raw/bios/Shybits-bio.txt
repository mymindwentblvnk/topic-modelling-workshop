Shybits is a Berlin based post punk garage rock trio made up of friends Liam from Brighton (Guitar & vocals), Piero from Italy (Bass & vocals) and Meg from South Africa (drums).
The fuzzy, feel-good sound is reminiscent of post punk and 90s garage rock and has been described as’’ Beach Boys suntan nostalgia meets Beatlesque Bedroom pop’’. 
Shybits have played with acts such as Pip Blom, Balagan, Dancehall, Vundabar, RÁN and Feels and Winter amongst others and are presently working on their new record.
Their debut EP, Idiot Like You, was released earlier this year on Duchess Box Records (home of acts such as Gurr) . They were signed to the label not long after their very first show. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Shybits">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
