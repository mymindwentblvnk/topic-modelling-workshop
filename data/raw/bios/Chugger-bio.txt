Chugger is a five piece metal machine that builds upon the foundation of the Gothenburg metal, takes the groove from the American south and the sinister setting of the darkest regions of the human mind and stranglehold them in an uncompromising vice. The result is neither just groove or thrash, but rather its own monster â€“ a head-on, full metal avalanche that stops for nothing.

Sweden's harsh climate and technological progress along with the blistering west coast weather forged what later became known as the Gothenburg Sound, with artists like In Flames, At The Gates and Dark Tranquillity. It should come as no surprise that this would eventually also become the breeding ground that spawned Chugger.
