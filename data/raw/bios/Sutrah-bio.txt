Quebec death metal act Sutrah’s first full length features compositions sprawled over a 7 year period, bringing together trimmings of themes written from 2011 to its completion in 2017. With inspirations ranging from Lykathea Aflame, Martyr, and Ulcerate, to Cocteau Twins and Olivier Messiean, ‘Dunes’ is the trio's initiation at forging a sound reconciling the violent yet malleable aesthetic of death metal with a more sonically serene colour palette. Such unstable contrast is depicted in the artwork: A Deva with a terrible face meditates in the lotus position eclipsing the sun: a symbol which parallels the Deva's twin capacity for light and life-giving, and immeasurable power and destruction. The lyrics weave around the theme of one conscience pulled apart by self-questioning, will (or lack thereof), doubt, dread, desire, apathy, and the sublime. Having festered in the minds of its creators for a long time, Sutrah now offers you a sign of things to come...
