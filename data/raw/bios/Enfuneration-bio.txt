Oklahoma’s Enfuneration is much greener than Sacrificial Slaughter, especially when it comes to album output. American Death Thrash is Enfuneration’s (ex-SkullPL8)  first proper release. The five years spent honing their craft definitely paid off. Lead-off track “Insidious Domain” is your standard death metal song. Stop-and-start rhythms give way to hollow-tone solos. Squealing whammy bar solos accentuate the wicked, nefarious mood of each track. The guitar pitch reaches the stars on the opening passage of “Grieving Process Denied.” Low-end chords and Asiatic harmonies lead to Nile comparisons. Middle range vocals allow for lyrical understanding, and the group perfectly meshes tempo changes. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Enfuneration">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
