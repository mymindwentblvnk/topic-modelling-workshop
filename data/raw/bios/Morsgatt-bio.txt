A goregrind band from Germany.

Born in summer 2000 with Fearer and Meatknife members, at one of our legendary barbecue sessions we had the idea to create a cudgel killer act which realy kick ass! Full of brandy/coke and chilly in our tripe we entered at one weekend the Audiocheck Studio in our Hometown Emden to record our 18 min.
ANAL ATTACKING HYPER GRIND ASSAULT!!

Shortly later the Meatknife guys Hightower and Braindead left Morsgatt and the Clitcommander joined Morsgatt to do the vokills.

Morsgatt played a very few liveshows after the release of KICK ASS UNDRESS MCD (on Noise variations) and in November 2002 we released a split EP with our anal buddys SCURVY from sweden.
