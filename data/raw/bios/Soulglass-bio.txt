Soulglass was founded by Felicia Firemane and Xivilae Mordicus in the spring of 2012. 

Felicia had been screaming/growling for a couple of years and also had hundreds of texts ready in her drawer. That's when she finally decided to start her own melodic death metal band. She immediately invited Xivilae to join the project as drummer since she knew about his previous experience with other metal bands and thought it would anyway be easier to compose with someone one shares an apartment with.

After a few days of searching, a very interested guitarist from a musician-site contacted Felicia and joined the band as lead guitarist.

For a long time, only the three of them were composing and making songs together, while many musicians made short appearances in the lineup as synth players and rhythm guitarists. It proved to be really hard to find members who had enough time to compose and actively play in a melodic death metal band. 

Lucius Rime joined as a bass player in December 2013.

In the fall of 2014, Soulglassâ€™ image and genre were sharpened by time, especially when Lucretia Raa decided to join the formation as the clean singer (and violinist). They then knew it was finally time to go to the studio, where they recorded their first 2 songs demo.

However, right after recording, the lead guitarist told Felicia he can't carry on with the band due to his colossal workload in the company he is running.

Nonetheless, very soon after the surprising turn of events, they found Victor Karma to replace their then temporary synth player and almost at the same time found their new lead guitarist Crowley Frostburn. 
After this, Soulglass carried on sturdier than ever and was ready to go and get gigs!

Their rhythm guitarist changed to Mortas Nox in the early beginning of summer 2015. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Soulglass">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
