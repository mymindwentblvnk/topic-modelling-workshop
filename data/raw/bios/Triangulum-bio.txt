There are two different bands that go by the name “Triangulum”:

1) A raw minimalist black metal band from the US. Formed in 2008.
2) An progressive metalband from the Netherlands. Formed in 2009.

1) 
Solo black metal project from the US


2)
Triangulum is a band that plays progressive metal while staying true to their personal findings, producing a very unique sound.
 
Its most profound characteristic is that their four members stand for ‘tuning’ things around, motivating themselves and listeners to look at, or better yet, listen to things in a different way.
 
Their main view is that they love to create trailblazing music, and strive to entertain the public in the best possible way.
