An obscure russian black metal project formerly a part of BlazeBirth Hall, founded in 1994.

Most compositions, writing and vocals are by Dagorath who was one of two guitarists of Forest along with Ulv G. Irminsson of Raven Dark. 

Shortly after the release of Forest's Обрекая надежду на вечность, Dagorath left behind the BlazeBirth Hall, his membership in Forest, and all of the political and ideological ideas. It was rumored by some that members of the BlazeBirth Hall killed him, but these theories were disproved in 2018, as Dagorath re-surfaced and released THE BEASTREALM after a two decade long silence.

In 2005, Ulv G. Irminsson was murdered and in 2019, Kaldrad Branislav was struck by a car and killed.
