Rone is the alias of Parisian DJ and producer Erwan Castex. Working originally as a filmmaker, he composed his first music creations between two shoots. His works, going from experimental techno to melodic ambient, soon grabbed the attention of the the most receptive ears: Ellen Allien, Mathew Jonson, Scratch Massive, and furthermore Agoria, who brought him to light in the amazing compilation "At the controls". He collaborated with his friend Lucy (Meerestief Records) for labels such as Perspectiv, Qoki, and, more recently, for the excellent Culre with an e.p. ("Continuity theory, to Adri"), that was instantly included in many playlists (Laurent Garnier, Mark August, Karotte...). The compositions drew the interest of Parisian label InFin√© (Apparat, Danton Eeprom, Cubenx...), that offered Rone a new chance of expression with the long awaited release of the maxi "Bora".
Rone currently has five albums, with the latest being "Room With A View", released in 2020. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rone">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
