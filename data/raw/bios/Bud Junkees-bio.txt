Bud Junkees (formerly known as Drunk Junkees) were formed 1999 in Imatra, Finland by Texa (drums), Santeri (bass), Jade (guitar) and Tero (vocals). Drunk Junkees was originally Texa's idea, he wanted to play drums in a shitty grindcore band and drink gallons of kilju.
With this line up the band did a few gigs and one record, a 4-way split called "Grind War Finland" (Hostile Regression) with Emulgator, Irritate and Murder Company. In 2001 Jade and Tero got replaced by Kimmo (guitar) and Pete (throat). The band changed their name to Bud Junkees and decided to make only 100% cannabis propaganda content for the love of getting high with good BUD! Also the musical style changed; nowadays Bud Junkees don't play just grindcore, they got a lot of influences from hardcore, sludge and maybe some stoner rock, too. In 2002 they appeared with 3 tracks on a split record together with Fleshpress. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bud+Junkees">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
