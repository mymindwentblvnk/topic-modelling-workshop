The Braindead have a simular sound as Seattle's The Acc√ºsed. Both had started out as basically a punk band though with some thrash in the mix but became more thrashier as time went by in the mid-to-late 90's. The band started back in 1984. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Braindead">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
