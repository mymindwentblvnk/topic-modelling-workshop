Torrential Downpour, an entity unto itself, dreams and reshapes its own existence to live vicariously through the musicians it harnesses. Structured by the imagery of human, Torrential creates its arms, legs and body through the percussive force of Peter Costa. Symbolized by guitar and piano, Jason Volpe transforms his energy of pure love manifesting the heart and stomach of this holographic being. The lungs and throat are sustained only by the lifeblood of vocal manipulator Prkr who naturally regulates breathing, filtering unwanted toxins and energy resonance. All of this falling apart without the apt sense and control of bass player Matt Cece as the brain and eyes.

Together, using a battery of harsh and hauntingly beautiful soundscapes, a voice and language are given to Torrential Downpour. A voice that struggles for its place in the collective unconscious. But through all of this, the soul always remains the same. A beauty that is unthinkable and unstoppable. A version of love you have yet to discover. Torrential is everything…everything you’ve heard or haven’t. Everything that is or isn’t. Torrential Downpour is a reflection of you…because in truth, you are everything. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Torrential+Downpour">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
