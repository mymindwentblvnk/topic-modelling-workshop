FAR FROM MIND was incepted by Dirty Scoundrel in February, 1995 as a purely experimental project aimed at reflecting the author’s current state of mind through music. FAR FROM MIND’s music, though insufficiently rich and saturated to be purely instrumental, used to be voiceless for quite a long time. Meeting with Tim in 1998 helped decorate FFM with vocal parts and English lyrics. Over several years’ span, the tandem covered a wide range of genres, including psychedelic rock, progressive rock, noise industrial and psychedelic metal. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Far+From+Mind">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
