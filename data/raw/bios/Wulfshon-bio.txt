Wulfshon was brought to life in Argentina, in 2006. But things started to happen a couple of years earlier, back in 2004. In that year Matthias started an unipersonal project that was mainly influenced by Melodic Black Metal and typical/folkloric music from Scandinavia (The lyrical aspect was always focused on the viking values/concepts about the world/universe).
In the begining of 2008, Matthias recorded a promotional EP that was baptized with the name of "Awaiting the Ragnarok" including 2 songs, into the compositive line of Vintersorg and the old Catamenia.

During that same year Wulfshon became a band. The line-up was Matthias W. on Guitar and Clean Vocals, Wolf on Guitar, Dyonisus on Drums, Skoll on bass, and Mauro Frison on lead vocals. In 2011, they released their first album, "Prinnit Mittilagart", and in 2018 their second album, "Daeg", saw the light of day and was released in Europe.

As of 2022, Wulfshon's line up include Matías Taubas Oyola (Guitars, Vocals), Fernando Larriestra (Bass), and Martín de Angelis (Drums) <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wulfshon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
