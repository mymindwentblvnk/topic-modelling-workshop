Formed back in 2008, Morpheus Rising has forged a reputation for lively stage shows and powerful melodic music, playing headline and support shows up and down the country.

A five piece, twin guitar band in the classic mould of British Heavy Rock with a touch of Prog, Goth, Thrash and the US metal/rock scene thrown in. The New Wave of British Heavy Metal dragged kicking and screaming into the new millennium. NWoBHM The Next Generation!?

Heavily influenced by bands such as Thin Lizzy, Iron Maiden and Alter Bridge, Morpheus Rising produce an energetic show which will keep the old guard happy and show the new generation how it’s done. Central to the band is the classic twin guitar partnership coupled with dynamic and melodic songwriting, from the balls out NWoBHM rock of Lord of the North to the lighter, more radio friendly Those Who Watch.

2012 saw the band touring their critically acclaimed album Let The Sleeper Awake across the UK. The album was regularly featured by Johnny Doom on Kerrang Radio, Shane Carlson on arFM, Tony Corner on Firebrand Radio, and elsewhere. Features in Classic Rock Prog, Classic Rock Society magazine and cover mount CDs led to sales across Europe, Asia and North America.

Touring continues throughout 2013, touring with Panic Room on their S K I N tour, and Cornerstone on their UK tour.

Work is now underway on the as yet untitled new album. The live set is beginning to feature songs shortlisted for this release as the year unfolds… <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Morpheus+Rising">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
