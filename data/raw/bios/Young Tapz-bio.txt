The musical journey of Young Tapz is undeniably one out of the ordinary. Music came in every shape and form, from merely singing along to it, dancing to it, and even picking up his mum's pots and pans and jamming as a child growing up in Zimbabwe. Though it wasn't one of his main priorities, it was certainly running through his veins and this was proven when he moved to New Zealand at the age of nine.

The struggles of moving to a new country- limited English and trouble fitting in, only helped Tapz blossom. He found his feet through his love of Green Day's music, picking up skateboarding, dancing and most of all, finding a way to express his solid individuality. However there was a missing link, and it was that boom bap "WHAT'S THAT LOUD RUBBISH IN THE SPEAKERS" kind of music that parents love to hate. He found hip hop and his soul was set. Hip hop hasn't had the best reputation for sending the right messages to youth, but Tapz was determined by the time he began high school that one day he'd be able to be a contributor to the change- a new face of hip hop. From humble beginnings in Africa to the world of life changing music- meet Young Tapz.
