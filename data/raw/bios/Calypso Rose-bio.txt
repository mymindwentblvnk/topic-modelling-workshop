McArtha Lewis, better known as Calypso Rose (born April 27, 1940 in Bethel, Tobago) is a Tobagonian calypsonian.

Named after the American general Douglas MacArthur, Rose's earliest years were a crowded environment - 19 people in a one-bedroom house. When she was 9, she moved to live with an uncle in Barataria

She began writing songs at the age of 15, and has written over 800 songs. In 1966 she wrote the song Fire in Me Wire, which has since become a calypso anthem. Rose was the first female to win the Trinidad Road March Competition, in 1977 with her song Tempo. She won the Calypso Queen title five years running. She has also won both the Trinidad Calypso Crown and Road March competitions in 1978, the Sunshine Award in 1989 and the Trinidad and Tobago Hummingbird Medal in 2000. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Calypso+Rose">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
