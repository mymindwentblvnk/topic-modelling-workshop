Electric Age, a hard rock band, was formed in August 2011, initially as a Deep Purple tribute band.
After taking part and winning some festivals in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, the connection between the members and the highly skilled live performances flourished, the idea of composing self-penned material developed. The next step was composing and recording the band's first material, an EP entitled Good Times Are Coming, released in June 2013. 

As for the style of the compositions, the band prefers not to stick to any pre determination, bringing in elements from each member's influence, ranging widely between genres. Both in rehearsals and concerts, Electric Age has developed the habit of improvising, making each performance unique and transmits energy to the audience.
