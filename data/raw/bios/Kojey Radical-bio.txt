Kojey Radical is a London based poet, musician and mixed media visual artist. He is also Creative Director of the PUSHCRAYONS collective/network & Art Director of contemporary menswear brand Chelsea Bravo.

Beginning as a contemporary artist Kojey moved through the arts with increasing curiosity and defiant will to never be confined to one art form. From as young as 9 years old Kojey chose to see every form of creative expression as one art form; allowing each one to become a new language for him to communicate through.

After releasing his debut EP in June 2014 Kojey quickly became a name to look out for, selling out his first headline show twice due to popular demand. Kojey is widely credited for his explosive live shows and subversive story telling ability, often referred to as a visionary and pioneer of the arts. Kojey's approach and unorthodox style has earned him the attention of GQ Magazine, Idol, Mechanical Dummy, Soul Culture, Wonderland, The405, Clash Magazine, The Fader, BBC 1 Xtra, OKAYAFRICA and Notion Magazine to name a few. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kojey+Radical">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
