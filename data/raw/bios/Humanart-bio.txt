From Santo Tirso (Portugal), the band Humanart started in September 1998, formed by five initial members – with an average age of 17.
Since the begining, the bands direction allways pointed to Blackmetal.
In 1999, they go to Rec N Roll studio to record "Fossil", their first demo. Produced by Luís Barros, "Fossil" was edited in 18th February 2000.
Through out the years, the band had suffered several line up changes, and had been acting live from time to time, spreeding their music in the undergroud.
In September of 2004, the new release was out “Hymn Obscura”. It was recorded and mixed at GraveStudio in Braga, by Pedro Alves and Humanart.
Besides the Demos, you can check out the band in several Metal compilations and publications.
When playing live, they usually added to the set the Bathory cover: “women of dark desires”.
In August 2005 Humanart became a one man project to JJ (Lead guitar and one of the founders of the band).
In the begining of 2007 new members were recruited and the band is back to live shows and preparing new material for the third release, out in 2008/09.
