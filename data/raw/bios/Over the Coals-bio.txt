Vancouver, B.C.’s hard-hitting metal quartet Over the Coals are back with their second full length album Closed Eyes at Sunrise, a brutal fourteen track assault on the senses that runs the gamut from arena rock anthems to full on thrash metal. Singer James McMurtrie’s “mix between Phil Anselmo and Chris Cornell” vocals lead a charge of sonic mayhem best described as a fusion of classic and modern offerings in the metal genre, creating a style that can appeal to fans of any kind of rock music.

Armed with the experience of creating, recording, promoting and distributing an independent album, gained through the release of their debut ‘Declaration’ in December of 2006, the band are gearing up to bring their sophomore disc to the masses. Tours of Western Canada and the Western US have been planned for the two months following the album’s July 1st release date, with plans for a full scale Canadian tour in the fall. In between outings on the road, Over the Coals will continue shopping the album to community, Internet, campus and commercial radio stations the world over as well as working to increase the fingerprint of the band through International distribution and promotion. 

Keeping the wheels in motion is the main focus of Over the Coals as they continue to show that success in today’s music scene can be achieved through independent means.
