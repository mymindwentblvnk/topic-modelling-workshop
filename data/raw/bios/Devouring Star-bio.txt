Their debut effort, ‘Through Lung and Heart’ was released on various formats through Daemon Worship Productions. What makes Devouring Star unique is their complex approach on the music, dragging influences from ambient, black, death and doom metal to generate a sound of their own. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Devouring+Star">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
