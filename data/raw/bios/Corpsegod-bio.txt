1) Brutal death metal from Italy formed in 1994. Released one rehearsal demo and Opinion About Sorrow EP in 1996. Later became Corpsefucking Art.

2) Death metal from Nottingham, UK;
CorpseGod was created by Jakk Perkins (Of Evil Scarecrow) and Paul "Omerta" Whitwell in summer 2009, originally intended as a Terminator spoof/tribute band named T-100. However, after Austrian Death Machine released Double Brutal they decided to take on a different direction.

T-100 became CorpseGod (no longer a spoof/tribute band) and the lineup was completed by Alex Holmes on vocals, Chris James on bass and pre-recorded drum tracks in the abscence of a permanent drummer. Since late 2009 CorpseGod have self-produced over an hour of material and are constantly working on more. They are now looking for a drummer to finish the lineup and gig as a full band.

CorpseGod are hitting the underground metal scene, playing as many shows as possible and really trying to make a name for themselves.
