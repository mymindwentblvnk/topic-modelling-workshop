Hailing from a small village just outside Trondheim, these four long-time friends set out for a musical journey. Since the beginning in 2003 they´ve come a long way, and despite their young age, they´ll let nothing come in their way. 


After 2 EP´s (which both gained great reviews in norwegian press) and a musicvideo, (running on the norwegian musicshow "Svisj") they´re now getting ready to hit the studio to record their debut-album. 

The music is metal, with elements of other sub-genre´s. And after endless discussion about what type of metal they play, they simply agreed, this is METAL! Or like the guitarst Eirik likes to call it, "Trøndercore"! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/MLGF">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
