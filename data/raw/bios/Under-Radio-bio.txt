Under-Radio is a progressive rock project put together by guitarist Eric Zimmermann and friends. Eric has previously participated in Lion Music's Warmth in the Wilderness: A Tribute to Jason Becker in 2001. Born in Kings Park, New York, Eric Zimmermann acquired his first guitar during high school when he traded in his porn collection for a friend's guitar. He soon thereafter began studying under Dream Theater guitarist John Petrucci. When John's bands started touring, Zimmermann continued his studies under Rich Kern and Terry Syrek. After graduating SUNY Stony Brook's Psychology program with flying colors (as a student, not a patient), he decided to veer off the path that he was paving toward the FBI Behavioral Science's Department and dump it all to move to California and start a rock band.

Zimmermann's eclectic musical tastes and styles are evident on the Under-Radio self titled release. You're bound to get many colors on your easel when you incorporate performances of members ranging from the Los Angeles Philharmonic to Fates Warning. One minute you're taking a peaceful walk on the beach, the next you realize there is a tsunami.

In addition to being an accomplished musician and producer, Zimmermann is also a Grammy-nominated mastering engineer. He spends his spare time studying martial arts, watching the news and hanging out with friends who collectively support many different breweries.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Under-Radio">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
