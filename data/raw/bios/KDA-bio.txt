KDA is an Electro/Punk Band from Germany.

They are known for spectacular live performances and stage shows.
One of the band members does also participate in Corvus Corax.

There are currently 2 Albums available: Jesusatan and Gift.

The third album seems to be on it's way, it's actually done but not yet released,
due to the bands idea to release it together with multimedia content such
as videos to the songs.
