Triana Park (aka Triānas Parks) is a Latvian rock band formed in Rīga, Latvia in 2008.

When you think about Triana Park, one of the first thoughts you will definitely have in mind will be about their extraordinary shows and extravagant lead singer Agnese Rakovska. But the second one will definitely be about their music which is kaleidoscopic mix of rock, pop and swing, a little from hip-hop with powerful vocal and enough boldness to achieve stars. Every Triana Park performance is like a great party where everyone would like to be invited to.

Kristaps Ērglis - bass;
Edgars Viļums - drums (currently also Gacho).
