Born in 1981, Boris Brejcha was involved in music since early childhood.
His education included drums and  keyboard lessons. This was a perfect foundation for the next step - producing and performing electronic dance music. 
Boris Brejcha began producing and DJ-ing in November 2006. After both his first online MP3 debut "Monster" EP and the next EP titled "Yellow Kitchen"  reached number one on many download platforms, he became the new techno shooting star and started playing gigs not only in his home country Germany, but also internationally.

Despite a common misperception, his music is not easily digestible, and can be more challenging to the average minimal/techno/hard house listener. He brings to the minimal sound a new sense of adventure, combining elements from electro, breaks, idm, and even sometimes (if you look really closely) some ambient arrangements in an attempt to expand the spectrum of minimal.
 
Boris Brejcha is also known under the moniker Anna  which mirrors the more technoid and dark side of him.

Anna aka Boris Brejcha has released on labels like Harthouse, Regular and of course AUTIST.records (where it all started...) and his releases have been supported by the likes of John Digweed, Sasha, Richie Hawtin and Microfunk a lot since then.
