Everything began at the end... after meltdown of the !T.O.O.H.! gang, Wokis (guitar) and Freedom (bassace) formed a cooperation with a clear objective: to continue to craft music in a more modest outfit to satisfy themselves (predominantly) and others. They began their work on new material immediately. As the formulaic three-chord songwriting scheme was not in their minds, the compositions grew in intensity, and the incubation time needed to spawn these musical pieces proved longer than anyone could have imagined. But nothing could stop the progress and by the darkness of Christmas time, it was to record a first opus. Alas, the fate of time (ear wear-out caused by excessive heavy metal) had corroded Mr Freedom, who decided to leave the duo. He has since been replaced by Walis (who is actually an old schoolmate of Wokis from their period at the highest mighty teaching of wheelmachinery) who successfully demonstrated prowess in bass spirals...

Wokis - Guitarcutter, noiseroar - a bit about me: I've been playing music for a loooong time - since 1st grade the violin, then since 6th grade the violoncello. Then came the bassguitar (Tříštivá Fraktura, + some side bands - Tři sejři a bubák). Then, in the year 2001, came the end of bassguitar and the beginning of guitar (Calmative Fallacy, !T.O.O.H.!) ... and so now is now

Walis - Bassace - in brief: musical basics on wind instrument (flute), then a big metal-plate oven called bombardon. At the same time began the guitar via schoolband Reikies, where a bassguitarist was needed and there I remained! Later, Hranice underground-style orchestra of Josef Líska. In Prague, for a while Preludium and some experimental outfit called Aaen Anima... After that, some time of rest, but now the music breaks out of me again! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Duobetic+Homunkulus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
