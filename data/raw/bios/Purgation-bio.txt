Traditional groove/doom-metal trio with a definite southern vibe to them from New Orleans, Louisiana. This description is fairly accurate, even though they do not play typical Doom. No, they don't get fast, but they are not a real slow-motion band either. Undoubtedly, bands like BLACK SABBATH and SOLITUDE AETURNUS are among their influences, whereas the main difference to the latter lies in the vocals, which have a grittier delivery here.

PURGATION offers us their debut-mini-CD "Realm Of The Dead" (which features a scene on the cover from Dante Alighieris "Divine Comedy"). Suitingly the production bears the stamp of the Louisiana-swamps, giving the sound of PURGATION a typical Louisiana-feeling.

At first the band went under the name PURGE (creating a CD with the same name) and played heavy/speed metal.
