Sweden, Sandviken (2014 â€“ present)
Breitenhold is the side project of Cederick Forsberg, a Swedish multi-instrumentalist who also plays in The Storyteller and has other studio projects such as Rocka Rollas, Blazon Stone, Mortyr, Cloven Altar and Lector.

According to Cederick, he started Breitenhold because he had many songs written for Rocka Rollas, which were a bit different but he had to record and release them somehow. Breitenhold is strictly a one-man project with lyrics refering to Cederick's personal life.
