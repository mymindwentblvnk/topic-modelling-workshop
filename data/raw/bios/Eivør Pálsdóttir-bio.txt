Eivør Pálsdóttir, born 21 July 1983 in Syðrugøta, Faroe Islands, is a Faroese singer/songwriter with a distinct voice and a wide range of interests in various music genres spanning from rock, jazz, folk, and pop, to European classical music. Her roots are in the Faroese ballads. Usually she's only referred to by her first name Eivør.

Many of her songs are in Faroese, some are in Icelandic and the three albums leading up to Slør were all mostly in English. On Slør she returned to singing in only Faroese. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Eiv%C3%B8r+P%C3%A1lsd%C3%B3ttir">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
