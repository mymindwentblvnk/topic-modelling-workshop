Lucian is a producer who first started releasing remixes. While he’s young on the scene, his tight future bass production has reason for us to give notice with a strong focus on writing and arrangement, Lucian knows what it takes to create a powerful experience. To date, his biggest releases have been remixes of Black Coast’s TRNDSTTR and Alessia Cara's Here, which collectively amassed over 100 Million streams on soundcloud, youtube, and spotify. 

His future plans remain to continue to move audiences in new remixes and singles in 2016. He he is set to release his debut EP Forever May 27th of this year and the reaction has been strong to the lead singles this month. Big things are coming from Lucian so keep your ear to the ground.
