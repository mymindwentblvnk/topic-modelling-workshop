Gospel  comprises Adam Dooling, Sean Miller, Vincent Roseboom and Jon Pastir.  Their sound mixes the atmosphere of psychedelia, structural sensibilities and instrumentation of Genesis-esque progressive rock, and primal aggression/desperation of hardcore/screamo.

Their debut full-length on Level Plane was released on May 10, 2005, entitled The Moon Is a Dead World. 

In late December, 2006, Gospel disbanded, leaving little hope that they would finish recording their next album, which was to be due in early 2007.

In late 2009, Gospel announced they had reformed and would be recording their new record in early 2010. However, after recording and releasing a song and one demo, they broke up once again, leaving their second LP unfinished and unreleased, as it had been prior to their reunion.

After reuniting again, they finally released their second album, The Loser, on May 13, 2022, just over seventeen years to the day after their debut. They followed it up on July 11 of the same year with the EP MVDM: The Magical Volumes Vol.1: The Magick Volume of Dark Madder or The Magic Volume of Dark Matter, an EP consisting of a single track that runs for nearly 22 minutes. They’d written it in 2005-2006 and had initially intended it to be their second album, which they’d planned to be a single long track. Despite being unfinished, it became a staple of their live performances. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gospel">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
