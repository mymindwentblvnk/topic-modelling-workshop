Undeterred by a style rooted in dark ideas and stereotype, Our Daily Trespasses strives to explore the genre and experiment with themes and methods rather than abide by the niche. In turn such an experiment has brought them to their current sound, bridging black, death, thrash and progressive metal along with hints of post rock, ambient and southern rock.

Conceived by ex –members of And Others, ODT has been growing strong in the Tucson, AZ scene since 2006. While originally a three piece, their sound has evolved to necessitate the five pieces they are today.

Our Daily Trespasses have established themselves as a quality over quantity band in turn attracting the full gamut of fans and musicians alike.
