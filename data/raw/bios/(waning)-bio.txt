Originally formed in 2007 by Jim Willig of Audioemetic and keyboardist Susan Hunt as a method of making some noise at Eugene Noisefest, the project has gradually matured into being the primary musical outlet of each.

Sharing an enthusiasm for doom metal, slowcore and ambient music, the Sacramento, California-based duo continued to make down-tempo, heavy ambient music borrowing from different styles. They released a 5 song home recorded self-titled debut that year, followed by a single, Visitation in 2008, and a set of live recordings titled Empty Rooms, all on short run CDR.

In 2009, the group added a drummer, Scott De Medeiros. They found themselves on stage opening for acts such as Giant Squid, Made Out of Babies, and Jucifer. At scattered points throughout the year, the trio recorded their second full-length, Always Ending, co-produced by Blake William of Superzapper Recharge. It's the first proper recording of the group as a rock band, featuring elements of shoegaze, post-punk and sludge metal. It was released spring of 2010. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/(WANING)">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
