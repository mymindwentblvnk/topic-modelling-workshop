Dirty on Purpose was an indie pop/shoegaze band from Brooklyn, NY. The band, which formed in 2002, was composed of Doug Marvin (drums, vocals), Joseph Jurewicz (guitar, vocals), George Wilson (guitar, vocals) and DJ Boudreau (bass guitar). Its music — guitar-oriented and fuzz-infused — drew comparisons to 90s bands such as Sonic Youth and Yo La Tengo. After its initial conception, Dirty on Purpose established a strong base in New York City, released one full album (Hallelujah Sirens) and three EPs, and was praised by media outlets Pitchfork Media, NPR, Spin, and Filter, to name a few. Throughout the band's existence, Dirty on Purpose opened for prestigious acts such as Arcade Fire and The Decemberists.

The band announced its breakup in December 2008 and played its final show on New Year's Eve that year at the Mercury Lounge in New York City. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dirty+on+Purpose">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
