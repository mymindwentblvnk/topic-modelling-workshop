Formed in Strasbourg, France, Absurdity started out by playing straight-ahead death metal, influenced by old Sepultura, Carcass and Bolt Thrower, but are now heading towards more metal-hardcore territory, with the addition of a sample player who gives the band its specific trademark sound.

Absurdity has already got his specific artwork, as well as their own musical identity, and have performed almost 100 shows in France and all over Europe, playing with acts such as THE HAUNTED,GOJIRA, DEICIDE, 25 TA LIFE, DEW SCENTED, ARKANGEL, BENEDICTION, VADER, IMMOLATION, SUFFOCATION, ROTTING CHRIST, DISCHARGE, BENIGHTED, and many (many!) more…. The Absurdity sound is cold and mechanical, alternating violent death metal passages with neck-snapping hardcore mosh breakdowns. Disemboweling/earth shattering rhythms and mind numbingly mental.
Vitalizing shows make them a promising reference for the future. Absurdity’s songs deal with the issues of the evil, social poverty or simply human misery, and the lyrics are influenced by authors such as Albert Camus, Franz Kafka and Georges Orwell. You can almost taste the noxious atmosphere as you listen to the band’s music whilst studying the album artwork – the abject misery and despair that man feels in his urban prison, set to a backdrop of overwhelming aural desolation.
Many tracks from the first E.P “Urban Strife” and samples from 2nd release “Industreatment” have appeared on compilations or samplers from such publications as Metallian Magazine, French Metal…, and had many promising reviews worldwide.

The release of “D:/evolution” (Urban Death records/Season of Mist/Believe Digital) marks a new turn in the band’s career, as they start touring France, expanding horizons and working on their live shows, proving terrific capacities and determination.
