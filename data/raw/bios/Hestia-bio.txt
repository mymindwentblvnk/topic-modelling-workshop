Hestia is a 3 headed hardworking young Belgian rockband. Full with drive and emotions. 

Hestia is formed in the summer of 2002. After a long period of writing and rehearsing, it was time to see some daylight. During spring 2005, Hestia's first demo came out and 6 songs loaded this little disk which resulted in a new style of rocking core. Fast meets slow; hard meets soft; progressive meets mellow. 

The new EP; called The Maze, came out begin summer 2006.

This magnificant peace of audio was followed in 2008 by their new CD "The New Generation" with 11 tracks that rock your head off! Check it out!

In the summer of 2009 Hestia played their last show at the Hageland festival in Aarscht, Belgium.
