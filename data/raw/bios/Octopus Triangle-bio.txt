What can one say about OCTOPUS TRIANGLE? They are neither aquatic nor geometric, but they are authentic in every other way.

Proceed with caution: only for those who like music to rock, excite, and god-forbid even challenge. Get ready to bang your head to 7/8.

Nothing watered-down about it… like a straight shot of 100-proof octopus ink!

It’s a sad truth that in order to be reborn, one must first die. Such is the case with OCTOPUS TRIANGLE, the phoenix of the simultaneous demises of 4 up-and-coming New England bands:  Fates Cruel Joke, Hemlok, Of Dreams and Madness, PtW, and others. Though in this case, the phoenix happened to be a slimy, tentacle-clad, deep-sea creature ready suck your face off with its mix of hard rock and progressive metal.

Original. From the radio rock to the experimental stuff right down to the name; for a band that wears their influences on their sleeves, there’s nothing like them. 

Brought to you by the letter “O”. And by the number “3”.
