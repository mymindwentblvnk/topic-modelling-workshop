There are 4 bands called Satanized:

01) A chaotic noise rock band from Philadelphia, PA consisting of guitar, bass, drums and vocals.
Philadelphia's SATANIZED were made flesh with their first live performance on the day of our Lord 06.06.06. Renowned for delivering highly intense, aberrantly convoluted, and theatrically bizarre live performances, the band has steadily conjured scathing frequencies and heavy rhythms that have left listeners trembling, pummeled and sliced - ready for sacrifice. Amid the assault, freakish moments of high musical complexity and lyrical depravity always ensure a clean kill.
