Hailing from Yorkshire, the Leeds based Bambooman constantly has his fingers dipped in a lot of concurrent projects. The Sonic Router signed producer keeps his creative self fed, producing tracks for vocalists and collaborating under various guises whilst writing his own material.

His two EPs for Sonic Router (the latest of which, Dulcet, was released earlier this year) outline his strikingly clean but intricately layered production style perfectly and his deft production touch was captured and widely commended on London vocalist Segilola’s serene debut EP for King Deluxe, Somewhere Along The Line.

Working a lot with found textures, field recordings and weird FXs, Bambooman’s unique and hip hop informed music has been championed by tastemakers like Gilles Peterson and Tom Ravenscroft (BBC 6Music), Kutmah (NTS) and Jon K (Hoya:Hoya) leading to live performances alongside lauded artists like Jon Hopkins , MF DOOM, Samiyam, The Gaslamp Killer and Venetian Snares. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bambooman">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
