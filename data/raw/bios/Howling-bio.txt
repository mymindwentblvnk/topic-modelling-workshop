Howling is the band of Australia-via-LA singer/songwriter RY X (formerly Ry Cuming, also in the electronic duo The Acid) and Berlin-based electronic producer Frank Wiedemann, better known under his alias Âme.

Duo started to collaborate back in 2012, when the EP "Howling" was released on Innervisions Records. Remix of this track by Âme became one of the biggest dancefloor athems that year and since then earned an status of  modern day classic. 

In May 2015, Howling released debut album called "Sacred Ground" on Monkeytown Records. 


 2) Howling is a whirlwind of loud, fast, melodic and thrashing death fucking METAL, with an emphasis on extremely catchy headbanging riffs meant to summon forth the powers of darkness!
