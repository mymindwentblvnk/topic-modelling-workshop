There are two artists who use this name:

1) Fairmont is an alter-ego of roving techno producer Jake Fairley of Toronto, Canada. Fairmont is his softer, more melodic and occasionally vocal electronica project. He has released singles and albums through Border Community (including the warm and fuzzy 'Coloured In Memory' in 2007) and Traum Schallplatten amongst others, as well as coming together with fellow outsider artists and Berlin-best-friends Metope and Pan/Tone to form the Beachcoma record label. He is also well known for his all-analogue live performances, wedging his mumbled vocals and burbling machines into the confines of the DJ booth, or spreading them across the grandeur of a stage, as the situation befits.

2) Fairmont is also the name of a band from Clifton, NJ. The band consists of Neil Sabatino (vocals, guitar, harmonica, piano), John "Hambone" McGuire (bass), and Andy Applegate (drums). They are on G.F.B records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fairmont">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
