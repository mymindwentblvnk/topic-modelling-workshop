British folk balladeer James William Hindle captures a distinctly 70s singer/songwriter sound, evoking everything from the great Nick Drake to early Simon and Garfunkel while finding contemporaries in Elliott Smith as well as the Essex Green and the Sunshine Fix (both of whom include members that play as Hindle's backing band). 

Hindle's self-titled debut, released on Badman in 2001 was a simple and soothing collection of folk songs. His 2003 sophomore output, Prospect Park, takes that craftsmanship and adds a touch of Elephant 6 pop, creating a beautiful and touching set of subtle melodies and moving lyricism. ~ Charles Spano, All Music Guide
