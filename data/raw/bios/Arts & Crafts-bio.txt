Arts & Crafts is a name of at least two bands:

1) An experimental duo of Chris Card and Ryan Schulze from St. Louis County, Missouri. Formed in January of 2006. self-released the pinecones ep in summer 2007.  Informally defunct as of 2010. However I think they did do a track called Brother in like 2011/2012.

2) A collaboration between George Logios, Willie Daniels and Walter Gibbons (aka Arts and Crafts), which released the 12" "I've Been Searching" (1984, Jus Born - aka "I've Been Searching (Walter Gibbons Mix)").
