1. Queequeg was formed specifically for an appearance in the 2013 avant-garde movie A Spell to Ward Off the Darkness by Ben Rivers and Ben Russel. In the movie they play a live set composed by 5 original songs, which is fully available on the official soundtrack. The concert scene was shot in Norway and the show is entirely filmed as a long take.

Queequeg also played a few gigs in Norway besides the one for the movie.

The name comes from a fictional character in the 1851 novel Moby-Dick by American author Herman Melville.
