Wisent is an experimental/atmospheric black metal project from Germany focusing politically on total liberation, including a move to veganism.  There is a lengthy statement on their Bandcamp ( wisent.bandcamp.com ) in which they stress that this is a logical move to make as environmentalists and anarchists based on the meat industry being one of dominance.  Musically, first effort "Total Liberation" provides dense, mid-tempo, mostly instrumental Black Metal.  Second album "Gros Morne" is focused conceptually around an ominous musical apocalypse, with long, complex compositions mirroring musical and philosophical messages to demonstrate the power of nature in some kind of punishment of humanity, "when she has decided to get rid of her overbearing and selfish guests." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wisent">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
