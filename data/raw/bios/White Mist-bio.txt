White Mist was founded in 2009 when Nico and Petri started to work on some long forgotten riffs. Despite long breaks in songwriting the material began to take shape, and suddenly when 4 more musicians were found in 2011, White Mist was born. 
 
Post-rock, doom-, death- and black metal bands such as Amenra, Burzum, Cult of Luna, Neurosis and Ophis inspire the band to create new even heavier metal into this dark and depressing world. In it's atmosphere and lyrics White Mist walks through a mystical mist covered forest in long and burdened strides, while experiencing longing, despair and excruciating pain, and finally ending in a slow meaningless death.
