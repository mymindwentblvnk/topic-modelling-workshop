Blacklodge is producing Industrial Black Metal, at the crossroads of innovative audacity in extreme music creation and rigorous research in dark psychedelic mysticism

Original pulse
Insanity/Suicide/Hell

Mutation emerging from an underground black metal band called Faust (1994-1998), Blacklodge started first as a one man band and released 2 demos. 
Saint Vincent was then joined by Silence and Diam's from his former band. 
They started to play live and strengthen the identity of the band through substances abuses and rising totemic fascination for contemporary environment and technology. This led to a third demo presenting the band to dark underground through schizoid video clip and personal concept.

Chamber of Darkness area

The band signed then with the dutch label Blazing Productions for their first album, Login:SataN (2003). 
This album put the band aside the leaders of a newest front : Industrial Black Metal. 
Since 2002 Jessy became the bassist of the band, even if Diam's recorded the bass on the album. 
The band played with Aborym for the first real Industrial Black Metal gigs ever, and presented a very aggressive and original presence on stage.

A new stage of evolution brought the band to new horizons with more courageous, avantgardiste work in a scene where looking backwards stands as a value of integrity and honesty.
Blacklodge is back at the dawn of 2006 with a new album, >SolarKult<, recorded at the Necromorbus studio and released by the french label End All Life Productions. 
A new powerful sound for the band, polluting sonic landscapes with a mix of pure aggressive metal and psychodelic, electronic violence.

Their temples and idols are rusted, and new dogmas are rising
This is the prequel to the new kult.
