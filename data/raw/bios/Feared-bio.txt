Feared started out as a two man project with members Mario and Ola in the middle of 2007 In Stockholm, Sweden. Lateron Christian Andolf and Henrik SÃ¶derlund joined to fill up the spaces and played a few small gigs. With a neverending flow of new songs Feared continues to develop and expand their musicality. Feared had drummer Kevin Talley joining the ranks for the drums in their 4th album entitled Furor Incarnatus in late 2012 to be released in 2013. Later in 2013 the band also introduced us to Jocke Skog on bass for the fall release of Vinter. After a busy few years Feared is back at it again with the recent release of Synder.
