Finnish musician and producer Sasu Ripatti is not one for lounging around and sleeping on his laurels. He juggles quite a wide range of consecutive projects, some his own (Vladislav Delay, Luomo, Uusitalo), others collaborative (Vladislav Delay Quartet, Moritz von Oswald Trio, The Dolls or AGF/Delay, the duo with his life partner Antye Greie-Fuchs), all focusing on different aspects of music. So, the addition of one more is in no way surprising, and neither is it surprising that Sistol has its own identity and language, away from his other projects.

Back in 1999, Sasu Ripatti released a self-titled album under the name Sistol, a persona he’s not returned to since. In summer of 2010 Sistol returned with a reissue of the self-titled Sistol album in a double-CD deluxe edition featuring a remastered version of the original album on one disc and another disc of remixes and remakes from people like John Tejada, Alva Noto and FaltyDL. Also, brand new Sistol album is out on Halo Cyan/Phthalo.

Sistol is perhaps one of Ripatti’s most difficult projects to engage with, as it benefits of none of the textural approach shown under his Vladislav Delay or Luomo guises for instance. Yet, the two new records also show how he manages to channel entirely different musical styles into very coherent and credible projects, and how Sistol ultimately proves to be yet another facet of a fascinating musician. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sistol">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
