Although Effloresce have only been playing in the current line up since late 2009, the five-piece from Nuremberg/Germany are on their way to establishing a signature sound, boasting heavy guitars, atmospheric mellotron sounds and complex rhythmic patterns. Singer Nicki‘s stunning range comprises crystal clear vocals as well as raw death metal growls; however, she also contributes flute sounds to the songs‘ more mellow moments. Effloresce‘s songs express emotions and mirror the band‘s technical capabilities without sacrificing musicality or listenability. Effloresce are also a committed live band and manage to capture their songs‘ atmosphere, energy and depth just as much in front of audiences as in the studio. Speaking of which, Effloresce have to date released the three-track EP „Shades of Fate“ and are working on a full-length album.
