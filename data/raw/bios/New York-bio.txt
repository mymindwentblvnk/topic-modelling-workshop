There are also at least two bands that go under the name of "New York":

1) The now defunct heavy metal band.

2) The indie rock band that was featured on the "Fresh Weird & Wonderful" compilation released by Australia's Pistol Records. Currently, New York has released the EP, "Your Love (The Remixes)," and their self-titled full album, both of which were released in 2008. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/New+York">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
