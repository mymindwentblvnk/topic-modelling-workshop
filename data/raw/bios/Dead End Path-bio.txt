The target was to blend the diversity of style of each band member to finally create a unique and complex kind of metal. April 2005 Dead End Path had finished nine songs and was ready to unleash them upon the scene. One year later Dead End Path recorded four of their songs and released those on their first mini-CD. After that, a year of many shows and rehearsals followed during which Dead End Path was able to put their own standards increasingly higher. The songs became more structured and the mix of melody and brutality became successful. Autumn 2008 Dead End Path decided that it was time to reveal their new material to the world. Once again four new songs were recorded for promotional purposes. At the beginning of 2009 Dead End Path continued perfecting their style even more in new songs which will be ready to be revealed on their oncoming shows. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dead+End+Path">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
