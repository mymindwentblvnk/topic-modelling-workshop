Formed in 2015, Ogarya is a French Brutal Death Metal project with science fiction as the main theme.

The band started with Ely (drums) , Med (Guitar) and Ryan (Bass). They quickly composed 10 tracks for the 1st album and then started looking for singers and found the voices of the band, Cat and David.

They undertook the recording of their 1st album and appealed to “Vamacara Studio” one of the hottest studios to mix and master the tracks.

Due to previous scenic experiences with former bands, the five members of Ogarya are preparing to defend their music on stage in 2017.

The first album "Ubiquity" released February 15, 2017. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ogarya">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
