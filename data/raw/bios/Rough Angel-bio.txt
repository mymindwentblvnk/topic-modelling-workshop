Rough Angel to announce EP "Hear the Angels Rock"!

US Heavy Metal weights Rough Angel have announced to release their recordings from 1993. Recorded at Paramount Recording Studios, Hollywood, CA and engineered by Csaba Zvekan himself. These recordings originally intended for promoters and industry are now available for the public.

The "lava" like music is lush and heavy with aggressive vocals hovering over the music. In the "grunge" era it is a true classic and can be compared with bands like Black Sabbath, Judas Priest and Led Zeppelin.

Csaba Zvekan who remastered these recordings had to say: "It's unbelievable how these recordings are almost two decades old and still have the power to convince the listener. The music and lyrics are still current especially these days. I got goose bumps remastering this piece of music. It definitely is a gift for all the friends and fans that are out there."

The players on the EP are Csaba Zvekan (Raven Lord, Killing Machine, Sardonyx, Emergency) - Vocals, Jimmy Z. - Lead & Rhythm Guitars, Marc Mougavero - Lead & Rhythm Guitars, Ross Manzo - Bass Guitars, Dave Kappos - Drums

The song tracks that have been put together are as followed:

1. Standing by Mirrors
2. Defiance
3. Let it Burn
4. Hear the Angels Rock
