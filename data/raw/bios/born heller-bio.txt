Born Heller is the brainchild of Chicago natives Josephine Foster (ukulele, guitar, vocals) and Jason Ajemian (standup bass, guitar, vocals). Specializing in a stark backwoods style of neo-traditional and transatlantic folk, the duo write, arrange, and deconstruct their work with an experimental edge that is as breathtaking as it is challenging. Foster, who also fronts the indie pop band the Children's Hour, has been compared to British folk legend Shirley Collins. Their self-titled debut was recorded by Paul Oldham in Louisville, KY, and released on Locust Records in May 2004. - James Christopher Monger of www.allmusic.com <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Born+Heller">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
