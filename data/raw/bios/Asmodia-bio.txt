Asmodia was first formed sometime in 1999 by Tom Fletcher. The initial line up played its first gig in 2000, however shortly after this, the lineup was changed. In late 2000, Tom teamed up with drummer Tim Sidwell, shortly after recording four songs for the Total Corruption demo EP.

Throughout 2001 and 2002 Asmodia gigged regularly building a strong live following. In early 2003 the band recorded the mini album Burn The Cross, which helped to widen the bands following.

In summer 2004, the band began recording for their first full length album, however this was interrupted by the departure of drummer Tim. Tim was replaced almost immediately by Steve "Chud" Conway. The lineup however only played one short live set before the band was put on hold due to Tom having nose & throat surgery, and advised to temporarily desist from vocals.

In late 2005/early 2006, a new lineup of Asmodia started rehearsing, with new guitarist Shane Haigh, Ian Clewes on bass guitar and Diz on drums.

In June 2006, Nigel Chester became Asmodia's most recent drummer, and the band began gigging within two weeks of his arrival.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/ASMODIA">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
