Out of the scattered remains of the gorey Dutch underground NAILGUN MASSACRE was stitched together by some of the scene’s most notorious undead veterans.

Heavily disgruntled with nowadays death metal this conspiracy commenced their piercing rampage against blast beats, technique neurotics, hippies and semi-intellectuals. Blunt as fuck, brutal as hell. Bad-tempered with long greasy hair, barely covering their red necks, and a disturbing fascination for powertools: NAILGUN MASSACRE grimly resurrected to drive rusty nails of eighties death metal into the third millennium’s cripple carcass!

First assault: BACKYARD BUTCHERY, a monstrous debut album featuring legendary PAUL SPECKMANN of MASTER / DEATHSTRIKE / ABOMINATION, unleashed in April 2011 by SLOWRUNNER RECORDS. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nailgun+Massacre">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
