The honesty in Luca’s voice is impossible to ignore, elevating songs rooted in the folk tradition to soulful hymns about the human condition. With influences from Joni Mitchell to Bob Dylan, Luca's reflective and sometimes melancholic songwriting pulls the listener into a deeply hypnotic meditation on redemption and transcendence.

Based in western Canada, Luca has opened for Dermot Kennedy, Serena Ryder, Hayden, and Frazey Ford, and he has toured in Canada, the US, Australia and Japan. Luca's music has been featured on Grey’s Anatomy, NCIS: Los Angeles, and Station 19, and his catalogue has over 18 million streams between Spotify and Apple Music. 2020 will see the arrival of Luca’s much anticipated second full-length album, beginning with singles “Half-Saved,” “Unfolding,” and “Another Way Around.” <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Luca+Fogale">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
