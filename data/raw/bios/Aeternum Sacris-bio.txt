Aeternum Sacris appears to be an artist from Japan.
There is very little information on the net about him.
Style wise Aeternum Sacris is similar to Shape of Despair, Doom:Vs and Forest of Shadows but with no clean vocals at all, thus far.
Musical soundscapes, melodic, heavy as hell, deep end growl vocals, subtle keyboards, its all there for the taking.
Aeternum Sacris does have a Myspace page with a link to download his first demo 'The Beginning Of The End ' from rapidshare.
Highly recommended.
