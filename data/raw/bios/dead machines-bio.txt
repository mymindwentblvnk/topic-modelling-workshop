Dead Machines is the husband-wife duo of John Olson (Wolf Eyes, founder of American Tapes) and Tovah Olson (Polyamory, Wooden Wand and the Vanishing Voice, Tovinator). Together with the use of handmade electronics, tape manipulation, and blistering volume, they deliver two squirming heaps of drone and moan that is more restrained than Wolf Eyes though less folked-out than Wooden Wand. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dead+Machines">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
