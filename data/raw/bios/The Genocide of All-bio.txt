Based out of Deep River, Connecticut and formed in the summer of '04 by members Darren and Justin, Sick of seeing so many posers and shit bands making it we decided to start our own creation, After 2 years of looking for other members we found Wes and Alex. It was the perfect chemistry, Grooving bass lines, machine gun double bass, fast and grooving rhythms and blazing shred solos, not to mention the in your face vocals. It was the perfect match of originality along with elements of old school thrash, death, and groove metal. After jamming in the basement and playing gigs and being direct support for some big acts such as symphony x,  Testament, Dying Fetus, Amon Amarth, Lazarus A.D and many locals for the past few years we finally got some money to record our first, full length album. After a very successful first album we have made a new ep which has gotten extremely positive reviews all over. We are all dedicated to bringing a fresh original blend of face pounding metal to your door step. We want to bring an end to all the pussy whipped ideas that have scarred music industry.
