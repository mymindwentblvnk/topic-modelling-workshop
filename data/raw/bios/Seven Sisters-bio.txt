Seven Sisters are a London-based Heavy Metal band formed by Kyle McNeill (vocals/guitar) and Graeme Farmer (guitar). The band released their first demo titled 'The Warden' in the summer of 2014. 

Inspired by the likes of Paul Di'Anno-era Iron Maiden, Angel Witch and Virtue, the band displays a keen interest in capturing the essence which made the NWOBHM movement of yore so special to begin with. Expect razor-sharp playing and captivating songwriting, all tied together with an anthemic charm that'll keep you coming back for more.
