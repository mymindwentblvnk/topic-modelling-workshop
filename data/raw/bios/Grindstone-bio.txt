1) From Portland Oregon the band Grindstone started up in a garage in the early 1990's and fine tuned their sound and gained popularity all around the Northwest in the late 90's and early 2000's before splitting up and going in different directions shortly after being offered a contract from Geffen records. Their music and first album (self-titled) was featured on a N64 video game called "Top Gear Overdrive" that was released around the world and gained them popularity in many different countries . They played their music all around the U.S. but were primarily based on the west coast playing in front of smaller crowds of a few hundred people to larger crowds of thousands at a time and they shared the stage with bands like Stabbing Westward, Alien Ant Farm, and Floater. They had also played with some popular 80's groups like Motley Crue, Slaughter and a few others when they were building up their popularity in the later 90's. The four original members were, Travis Ludahl (drums) Chris Hyde (guitar) Lamar Stilwell(guitar/ vocals) Tony Miller(Bass guitar)
