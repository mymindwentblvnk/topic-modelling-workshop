There seems to be several bands called Enter.

Enter(1) is a swedish synth pop band writing ironical romantic and naïve songs in swedish. They are from Uppsala originally. They have a flair for the futuristic.

There is also a new czech singing rock band from Czech Republic using the same name. in 2009 they produced new CD called "Temný stránky" (Dark pages).

There is also a band from Northern Illinois using the same name.  They are a rock band with 90s influences & played the Vans Warped Tour '06 on the Ernie Ball Stage in Milwaukee.  New album is sketched out to be late winter '07

And there's also a Finnish alt/garage/punk band by the same name. Enter was started around 1995 in Joensuu when three blokes, Otra, Osku and Pete teamed up and put their heads together aiming to form a group to play ”some decent rock music”.  At the moment, Enter is planning to start working on some new material. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Enter">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
