Wormphlegm was a duo from Finland who played a special kind of funeral doom metal mixed with black metal elements. Their music has been described as slow, monotonic, featuring crushing guitar work and ritualistic, almost trancelike, drumming. It also features occasional serene, near-melodic guitar parts.
The band members are Maggotworm Incinerator Abscess (drums, vocals) and Grubgorge Pestilent Diarrhoeator (guitars, bass, vocals), also member of Tyranny).
They released a demo tape in 2001 titled "In an Excruciating Way Infested With Vermin and Violated by Executioners Who Practise Incendiarism and Desanctifying the Pious" (which includes only one song that lasts for 32 minutes) and a full-length album in 2006 titled "Tomb of the Ancient King". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wormphlegm">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
