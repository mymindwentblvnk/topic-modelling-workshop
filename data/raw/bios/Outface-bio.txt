Outface were an American band hailing from Cleveland, Ohio, playing a mix of metal, old school hardcore and reggae, influenced by the likes of Bad Brains. Outface are notable for featuring Derrick Green later of Sepultura-fame on vocals (though having performed under the pseudonym of 'Simon Verde') whilst guitarist Charlie Garriga went onto CIV and bassist Frank Cavanagh later joined Filter. They released one LP in 1992, entitled Friendly Green and contribued the exclusive track Bullet to the 1994 Cleveland metal-scene compilation, Dark Empire Strikes Back. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Outface">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
