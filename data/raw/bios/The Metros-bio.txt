Most Recent: The Metros (London, UK)
Were a teenaged south London five-piece consisting of Saul Adamczewski (vocals), Jak Payne (guitar), Joe Simpson (guitar), Freddi Hyde-Thompson (drums) and Charlie Elliott (bass). When lead singer Saul Adamczewski discovered his dad's old vinyl collection, the sound of south London five-piece The Metros took a different twist. Initially inspired by ska, The Strokes and The Libertines, Saul and friend Jak began listening to the sounds of Squeeze, The Specials and Ian Drury and The Blockheads.  The result is a fusion of pop, punk, funk and rockabilly and captured the ears of 1965 Records boss James Endeacott who also signed The Libertines and Mercury Prize nominees, The View. The band split in 2009, however.
