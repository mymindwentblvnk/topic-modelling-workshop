Thanapat Bunleang (born Khazitin Bonleunge, formerly Thanapat Thaothawong), better known by his stage name Thaiboy Digital (also known as Thaiboy Goon, Thaiboy, DJ Billybool and Nino), is a Thai-Swedish rapper and singer. Born in Khon Kaen, Thailand, he moved to Stockholm, Sweden at the age of eight, and is now based in Bangkok. In addition to his solo work, Thaothawong is a member of the group Drain Gang, along with the rappers Bladee and Ecco2K and producers Whitearmor and Yung Sherman.

Born in the Isan region of Thailand, Thaothawong's family moved to Sweden from Thailand in 2003 after his mother became a chef in the Austrian embassy in Stockholm. In his teen years, Thaothawong became involved in the city's music scene, joining what would later become Drain Gang and collaborating with local artists including Yung Lean. In 2015, due to the end of his mother's work visa, Thaothawong was forced to leave Sweden by Migrationsverket, the Swedish immigration authority and return to Thailand, settling in Bangkok. In Bangkok, Thaothawong began recording with local artists such as Younggu and Dandee, while remaining a member of Drain Gang and contributing to all of their subsequent releases, including the 2019 release Trash Island which was partially recorded in Thaothawong's apartment in Bangkok. He got married on 7 January 2020 and his first child, a daughter, was born on 9 February 2020. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Thaiboy+Digital">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
