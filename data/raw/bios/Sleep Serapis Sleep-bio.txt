With their new self-recorded self-release, “The Dark Awakening”, Sleep Serapis Sleep set a new precedent for independence in hardcore-metal. Delivering raw and unrelenting intensity in its 8 tracks, the band maintains their strict opposition to the lesser musicianship that so often accompanies it. But simply defying trends was not the goal of the album. “The Dark Awakening” was written to laugh maniacally at the insincerity that plagues its scene… and to break it.
