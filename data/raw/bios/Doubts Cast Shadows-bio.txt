Doubts Cast Shadows are a 5 piece metal band, hailing from Fife and Edinburgh. Established in 2006, the band has undergone many changes since its beginnings. Two years and six member changes leaves only two original members. But this band by its very nature seems to take change in stride, coming through each line-up change with a more intense sound and focused outlook.

This band in no way claim to be unique, however since the very beginning, they have steered clear of the current metalcore cliche's such as "sludgy breakdowns" and "pig squeal" vocal stylings. Instead the music they write is an honest depiction of their collective musical tastes.

Since the band released their first EP "Last One Alive, Turn Out The Light" in march 2007, they have played up and down the country. Including some bands such as "Exit Ten", "The Casino Brawl" and "The Band Apart" to name but a few.
August 2007 saw the turning point for Doubts Cast Shadows as not only did they lose two original members, they also began writing material that would later appear on their debut album "The Downfall".
Over the coming year (2008) they would change members a further four times before the line-up became the one we know today. All the while the band did not falter in their writing of material for "The Downfall".

So with an album behind them and their fanbase growing on a daily basis, 2009 looks to be a very important year for Doubts Cast Shadows.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Doubts+Cast+Shadows">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
