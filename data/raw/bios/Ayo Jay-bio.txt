Ayoola Ogundeyi Jr., or ‘Ayo Jay’ as he is widely known is an exceptionally talented and promising young singer and song writer.

Although he discovered his musical inclinations at a tender age, his parents placed a premium on higher education so upon graduating from high school in Nigeria, Ayo Jay moved to the United States to pursue a college degree in Finance and Investments. During his spare time, he found himself either listening to, or writing and singing songs.
