This ambitious band from Vilnius, Lithuania was founded in 2012. Their music is the best representation of the genre’s canon, worthy of the ears of every Metalcore lover – even the most fastidious ones. Finding hope and serenity in despair is the message that Chasing The Rise delivers through their music. Every song is unique, and the moods vary between very calm, slow, fast and aggressive. Chasing The Rise combines technicality and melody, without losing song structure and impact. Intensive melodic guitar riffs, massive breakdowns, and strong emotional vocals are what makes Chasing The Rise and their frontman Vytis Chase stand out as one of the most promising Metalcore bands in the Baltics and in Europe.

Chasing the Rise has recorded with Andreas Magnusson, known for his work with Born Of Osiris, Fit For A King and Wolves At The Gate. The band is going strong since the beginning. They have played at the three biggest Lithuanian festivals, namely "Devilstone", "Karklė" and "Galapagai", sharing the stage with well known names such as Dead By April, Behemoth and Beyond All Recognition. In 2013 the band released their debut EP “The Dawn”, with inspiring artwork created by Ernesta Vala. The 2014 music video “Internal Fight” reached 30,000 views on Youtube. In 2015 the band worked on their second EP “Chapters”, which was successfully released in May 2016. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Chasing+the+Rise">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
