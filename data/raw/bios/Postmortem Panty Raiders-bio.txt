We decided to start this project purely out of boredom, and feeling the need to stir some shit up in the local scene, which we did successfully. We've grown attached to the dead hooker jives in which we produced so we're going to continue to write new shit and put it up for everyone to hate.

In late 2008, a fully lined up band which consists of members from Dissolution, Putrescence, Krull, Beyond Betrayal & Exsanguination. The line up is going to prove just how tight and brutal the Winnipeg death metal scene can be.

Writing has started for a follow up to 2007's explosive EP 'Dick Full Of Sores' named 'Slaughterotica', slated for a 2009 release. Expect to hear the 10 tracks from the EP, as well as another 15-20 jems currently written or in the writing process. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Postmortem+Panty+Raiders">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
