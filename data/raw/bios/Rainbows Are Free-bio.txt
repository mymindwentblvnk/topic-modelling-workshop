"Rainbows Are Free's sonic locus appears on the rock n roll family tree at the point where proto-metal and psychedelia shared a common apocryphal ancestor before branching off into their own distinct lineages. Believers in Medicine is indicative of this relationship, ripe with heavy riffage and stoner swagger"- Richie Tarver

Rainbows Are Free formed in late 2007 as the conglomerate of several long time heavy rock n roll bands from Norman, OK.  In February 2008, RAF self-released an eponymous demo EP.  A year later they began work on a full length album Belivers In Medicine which was released in April 2010 on Guestroom Records Records.  Both the demo EP and Believers in Medicine were recorded at the legendary Bell Labs recording studio (engineered and mixed by Trent Bell of Chainsaw Kittens fame) in Norman, OK.  RAF has been steeped in the festival circuit and playing continuously in support of Believers In Medicine as well as supporting bands of similar ilk such as High on Fire, The Sword, Dead Meadow and Queensryche.

RAF is currently working on multiple releases, the earliest of which is slated for fall 2011.

New album, Believers in Medicine, out on Guestroom Records.
