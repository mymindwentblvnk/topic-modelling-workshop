“Open-Minded” as it should be! Loud, melodical and absolutely unique songs with heavy guitars and a charismatic voice - for all friends of almost all genres – never to say what comes next ! This extraordinary band - the name means "transitory written and printed matter, not intended to be retained or preserved", established in 1989, can not be banned in any musical drawer ! Listening to their music – live, or like here, on their 4th album – allways surprises! For sure: some kind of everlasting MUSICAL “TRENDKILL” ! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ephemera%27s+Party">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
