Death Without Weeping is a band spawned out of an area that metal had seldom touched. The music scene at the University of New Hampshire was far too calm for the likes of Keenan McLaughlin. McLaughlin began to recruit members in his freshman year at UNH. To his surprise, he found musicians who shared his fondness for the abrasive. Anyways, they made a band and it lasted a few years before they moved onto more developed pastures. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Death+Without+Weeping">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
