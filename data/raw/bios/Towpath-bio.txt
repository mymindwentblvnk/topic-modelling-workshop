Towpath is a Satanic death/black band from New York. They are recognizable by blatantly anti-Christian lyrics and theatrical live performances. The two lead singers would often dress in black unitards and wear grotesque goat masks to mimic demonic spirits. Their vocal style is unique and varies differently on several songs. They were appearantly well known in the Satanic circles of their home area and would play shows at gatherings for occultists. One such venue was known as "Snakeland." They are disbanded and without any great exposure or a real record deal, they have fallen into obscurity. However, the group was primarily just several college studenst expressing themselves with the band. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Towpath">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
