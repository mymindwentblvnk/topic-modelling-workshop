Muspellheim was spawned in the fall of 2004 as a collaboration of experienced artists with extensive global roots and a who's who of Western Canada's extreme metal underground. The band features musicians previously associated with Soulscar, Abuse, Myopia, Ritual Demise, Tard and Crackwhore.

The Muspellheim sound was created to serve as a perfect fusion between black, grind and melodic death metal. Drawing influences from across the board, Muspellheim weaves seamlessly from clean and somber, to hyper-blasting and vicious, leaving the listener captivated from opening riff to the final note played. Emphasis lies on melody, brutality, groove and lead with the overall tone carrying a perpetually dark and entrancing vibe. Self-absorbed accolades and descriptions could fill this page but are meaningless and tired. We shall let the music do the talking...
