Float away in a dreamy haze with the creative arrangements from They Dream By Day, made by Swedish musician and actor Patrik Berg Almkvisth. Born into a musical family, one of his earliest memories is falling asleep every Sunday under the grand piano his father was playing in church. Throughout his childhood, Patrik was surrounded by music and his interest continued to flourish as he later began studying music full time. After withdrawing from the Royal College of Music in Stockholm, he continued his education within the arts by studying theatre at Calle Flygare Theatre School, Stockholm University and Linnaeus University. Nurturing two careers at once, Patrik splits his time between acting and producing, enjoying the synergetic effects of his two crafts. From acting heâ€™s developed a deep understanding and experience of storytelling, a skill he brings with him into the studio. Patrik releases music under several pseudonyms, LUCHS and Silver Maple among others, and combined his music has more than 830 million streams on Spotify and counting. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/They+Dream+By+Day">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
