- Hardcore, Prague / since 2010 -

Skywalker was founded in the summer of 2010. In the same year, the guys recorded their first EP "Hic Sunt Leones" that came out before
their first show in December 2010. It was not received very well, unlike their live sets since January 2011. In the summer of 2011, the 
second EP "Arkham" came out that was received much better in the Czech hardcore/metalcore scene. The band set off for a club tour
that year, playing in many Czech cities, and even plays a counple of shows in Slovakia. In 2012, the band continues to play shows, even gets 
to Germany. Nearing the end of the year, the third EP "Babylon" is released. It is somewhat a breakthrough for the band - both thanks to the 
sound of the EP that combines hardcore with classic 90's punk rock and some hip-hop elements, and the success - many reviewers 
and fans within the Czech/Slovak scene consider it to be one of the best pieces ever to come out of domestic hardcore music. Aside from 
playing in clubs, the band plays numerous summer festivals, goes on tour to Slovakia and Austria, in September 2013 even to Canada. 
Skywalker has shared the stage with names like: For the Fallen Dreams, First Blood,
Defeater, Pay No Respect, Till We Drop, As Enemies Arise, Abhorrence, No Second Chance, Point Blank Range and many more. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Skywalker">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
