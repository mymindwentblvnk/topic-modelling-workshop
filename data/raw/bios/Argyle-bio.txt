Based out of Salt Lake City Argyle is a new band with an awesome sound. Within 1 week of releasing their demo CD they topped the charts on Reverbnation.com and have continued to grow. Argyle started as a group of friends that attribute their friendship to a common love for music. For years they always jammed just for fun, simply using the musical fusion created as an outlet to life. Finally, someone realized that they should organize themselves, start writing songs and doing shows.They realized this in the fall of 2010 and the pieces started to roll as the shows and studio time began. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Argyle">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
