After some lineup-changes(Johannes Helmuth started playing the guitar in the band in 2006) they recorded an EP in 2006. You can hear the full EP on http://www.myspace.com/talesofhate

They split up in 2008. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tales+Of+Hate">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
