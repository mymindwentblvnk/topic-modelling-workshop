Target (real name Darren Joseph) is a grime producer from East London. He was a former member of Pay As You Go, but after the crew disintegrated he went on to form Roll Deep with Wiley, Breeze and Flow dan. He is recognised as one of the figureheads of Roll Deep, especially since that Wiley has been focussing on solo projects.

Target hosts his own radio show on the BBC station 1xtra, playing hip hop and other urban music as well as grime. The show currently on Sunday evenings from 7-9. He is also responsible for the Aim Higher series of grime DVDs.
