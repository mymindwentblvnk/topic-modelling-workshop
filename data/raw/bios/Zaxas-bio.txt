Zaxas is a quality power metal album, released at a time when power metal was hardly in vogue. With a musical style akin to, perhaps, Iced Earth or Metal Church, and a vocalist who occasionally reminds one of Ronnie James Dio, this band had all the pieces in place but disappeared after the one album. Ultimately Zaxas is one of many bands who could have been big had they caught the right break, but it was not meant to be.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Zaxas">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
