Ivahn was the singer of "Sugarless", a Spanish hard rock band. In 2005 he moved to L.A. to record his first maxi single as singer. "Huecco" is the name of his new band. It sounds like a mix of rumba, reagge, rock, spanish sounds, samba, punk, hiphop and ska, which is called Rumbaton. He mixed flamenco guitars with electric ones to make riffs.

KC Porter took into account the drummer Kenny Aronoff (Rolling Stones, Smashing Pumpkins, BB King...) and Víctor Andrizzo (Shakira, Juanes...); bass by Paul Bushnell (Alanis Morissette, Tracy Chapman...); percusion Luís Conte (Madonna, Eric Clapton, Guns n’ Roses...)and Ramón Yslas (Christina Aguilera).
