One day the skies opened up and god chose 5 righteous dudes to start a metal band. He said to them, "Go forth, and create music so brutal that the balls of Satan himself, shall burst!" God then uttered, "Thou shalt do work!" and Murder in Greenwich (pronounced: gren-itch) was born.

Murder In Greenwich is a death-core band from the area of Lancaster County, PA. Formed from a combination of past local bands from Hardcore, Metal and Rock and influenced by the brutal, hard hitting metal and hardcore scene of bands like All Shall Perish, Suicide Silence, Underneath The Gun, Emmure, and so on... Murder In Greenwich is the perfect combination of hard hitting heavy breakdowns and death-metal riffs.
