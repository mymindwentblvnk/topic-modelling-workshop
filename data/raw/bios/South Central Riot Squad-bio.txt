S.C.R.S.(South Central Riot Squad) is a loud, young, and sleezy punk rock band coming straight out of the gutter of South Central, Los Angeles, California. Filled with pure raw energy that shows in their performance. All about the rock n' roll lifestyle; sex, drugs, and punk fucking rock!
Formed in 2002 by frontman, Efrain, and earlier bassist, Alex. As time went on, members had feuds, started to decay and left. A couple hundred shows later and a couple thousand beers later, S.C.R.S. was known to be one of the top bands to bring the South Central punk scene up to its feet and shouting their lungs out singing "Hanging out at the gig, drinking my 40oz. 40oz!" The year is 2007 and with a few DIY releases and few comps out, S.C.R.S. is at there beginning of their journey with their latest album "In This City..." With many influences all round. From Clit 45 to Motorhead, from Broken Bones to Iron Maiden. With the Squad back up on its feet, they will soon be back up on stage where they belong tearing shit up.
