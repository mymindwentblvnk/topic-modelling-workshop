Shurik'n Chang-Ti (real name Geoffroy Mussard) is a French hip hop artist born in Marseille on 11 March 1966, with Malagasy and Réunionnais origins. He is one of the members of the highly successful group IAM, as well as a major solo artist. With his brother Faf Larage (Raphaël Mussard), he also forms the group La Garde.

In 1988, he met Akhenaton, with whom he formed IAM.

After three albums with IAM, Shurik'n decided to start pursuing a solo career with his 1998 album Où je vis.
