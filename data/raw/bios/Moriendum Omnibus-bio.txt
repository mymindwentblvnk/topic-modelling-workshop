MORIENDUM OMNIBUS was originally a project containing a 4 track and a broken old microphone.  Daniel Guenther previously of (Sarcophagus U.S.A.) and Anthony Walters (Sapphist)-(Chicago grind core band) got together about once a week to put down some metal tracks and just be pure fuck'n metal.  The process was great since there was not alot of production work to deal with so it is just pure metal mayhem.
