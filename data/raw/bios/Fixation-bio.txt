Fixation from Norway is challenging genres combining elements from metalcore, stadium rock and post-metal with electronic elements and dynamic melodious synthesizers. Catchy riffs, striking vocal performances and heavy bass and drum rhythms makes them a roller coaster of melancholic aggression. With earnest lyrics and a refreshing take on social criticism they convey interpretation of current affairs in their writing. Whenever the music reaches the depths of it’s beautiful and soft vulnerability, you’re abruptly hurled back up again by aggressive riffs and bass lines. The result is compelling and massive music that appeals to a generation rather than to fans of one specific genre.

The band is Jonas W Hansen (Vocals), Martin Gravdal (Bass), Martin S. Selen (Guitar), and Tobias Østerdal (Guitar).

Their debut EP, Global Suicide, released fall of 2020 and received impressive response from media. In 2021 Fixation finally got the chance to play live and performed at the By:larm festival, Musikkfest festival and the Rockstream festival in Norway amongst other. They got referred to as “The most promising rockband at the by:larm festival” by the Norwegian newspapers Dagsavisen. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fixation">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
