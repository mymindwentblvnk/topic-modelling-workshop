Killed By Butterfly are a hard working bunch of friends from Jakarta, in
Indonesia.  They Play a rather punk Inspired Melodic Metalcore. They Started in early 2004 and after a few line-up changes achieved a stable enough line-up to release a CD on RYDE Records in 2008.  Sanity/Insanity is a groove ladden album with very melodic guitar leads, that will get you head banging in no time.
