Musical Career

As Héctor & Tito

Tito and his partner released a number of hit songs in their native Puerto Rico, including "Amor de Colegio" (ft. Don Omar), "Felina", "Baila Morena" (ft. Glory), and "No Le Temas a Él", a song which not only raised their popularity, it helped raise popularity for the then up-and-coming Trebol Clan. After years of working together, they separated, but not before releasing a final album, Season Finale, which featured some of their greatest hits. The duo broke up due to Tito's belief of disloyalty from Hector.


As solo artist

After much delay, his first solo album was released, Top of the Line. The album was a hit, reaching #1 in Puerto Rico and knocking RKM & Ken-Y's album, Masterpiece to #2.
Top of the Line featured 20 new songs, with collaboration from artists such as Daddy Yankee, Don Omar and Beenie Man. It featured quite a number of hits, such as "Caile", "Mía" (ft. Daddy Yankee), "Tu Cintura" (ft. Don Omar), "Flow Natural" (ft. Beenie Man and Deevani) "Secreto", "Máximo", "Tuve Que Morir" and "Me Da Miedo" among others.

Since then, he has released five studio albums: 


• Top of the Line (2006)
• It's My Time (2007)
• El Patrón (2009)
• Invencible (2011)
• Invícto (2012)
