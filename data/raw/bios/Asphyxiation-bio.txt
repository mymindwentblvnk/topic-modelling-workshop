It was a stormy night in Løten, the wind was blowing both from south and north. Oh no, it was no "dear mom". Håkon felt the wind in his hair. He took his bass and headed forth to Sentralen, there he met Morten in newly washed pants. Espen came riding on his proud horse from the dark shadowvalley Trysil. The snow made his face cold as ice. "Fuck!" he thought, as he played a madmans drumsolo on the horses neck.- Håkon listened, what did he hear in the distance? What a marvelous talent, what a great drummer! At the same time, from the cold, bleak north, came Kjølle with his group of tormented souls. It was Huldra, Puken and the evil Blæstra. With the hair of Huldra as strings, he pulled an incredible guitarsolo that shook the easternvalleys forest with cruel, satanic tones. When he arrived Løten he stopped for a rest, there he met Espen and Håkon. Thats how it happened, evil rose from the sleeping dwell, and straight out of hell came: ASPHYXIATION
