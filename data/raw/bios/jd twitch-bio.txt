aka Kelvin Bridge, aka Mount Florida (one half of), a(ctually)ka Keith McIvor......is one of the two DJ's that founded Optimo (espacio) which runs on Sunday nights / Monday mornings at the Sub Club (Glasgow). Previously he was the resident DJ at the legendary Pure in Edinburgh, a club started with his former partner, behind the decks, Brainstorm.

JD Twitch is responsible for a multitude of edits and reworks on a number of tracks that are used almost exclusively for his DJ sets. A pioneer of using Ableton Live software to enhance and expand on the two turntables and a mixer set up. He has also remixed the likes of Liquid Liquid (who's song Optimo was the inspiration for the club name) to Franz Ferdinand, Sons & Daughters and a range of other artists.

Noteable releases from JD Twitch and JG Wilkes are the How to Kill the DJ Part 2 and Psyche Out mix albums, both released c.2005, but keep a eye out for both DJ's remixes and appearances at a club near you.
