Osculum Obscenum was a Black Metal / Grindcore band from São José, Santa Catarina, Brazil. Tracing their origins all the way back to 1993, this is finally the first full-length release of Osculum Obscenum, and what a sick grinding piece of art it is. Fully reveling in blasphemy, sodomy, lust, humilation, perversion, and filthy sadism, this sick trio break out all the leather whips, needles, razor blades, latex strap-ons, gimp masks, and bondage rope for a truely punishing experience. A really sick and depraved atmosphere is what the album gives off, with all of its sadist concepts, satanic lyrics, and pure, straightforward grindcore. 

The merging of both satanic and sadomasochistic lyrics with grind is something that is really rare these days, and the honest, purely sick feeling the band convey is just depraved and unnerving enough to really question their motives. This album brings to mind the great feeling of the early days of Sarcófago, Impaled Nazerene and Beherit, although not as noisy and primative sounding in execution.

The closest similarity to aesthetic philosophy and theme is really a mix of their contemporaries Cock and Ball Torture, Impaled Nazerene, and Tsatthoggua -- grind, black, and nihilistic perversion all rolled into one flaming shower of piss. The awesome artwork and packaging design, done by Sasha Pahlke of Cock and Ball Torture, compliments the music well, but its not nearly as explicit as I'd like it to be. If this album had been released five or seven years ago, it would probably be considered a classic, cult release, but right now it stands alone as a brilliant, musical pleasure of the flesh. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Osculum+Obscenum">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
