In middle of 2010, two friends Styx and PowerSquad, (in which their projects and they have more than one year in the music) recorded a Kalmah cover - Dance of the water. It was not serious. But they both enjoyed working together that they decided to create a project Bloody Terror.
Eighteen months was composed material for their debut album. In autumn 2011 they started recording album, and BT joined Dr.Trajan. There were many other musicians - but only 3 all of them have remained the same. Debut album release 15 september 2012 via INVINCIBLE/MEDIVAL RECORDS. 
In september 2013 band enter to the studio for recoding their next album. New label and release date of somophore album announce soon.
This true Death Metal for real metalheads!
