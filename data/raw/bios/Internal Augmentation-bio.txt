an australian tech/death metal band.Internal Augmentation was created by Shane Smith and Mick Brennan in 2004, but it wasn't until 2005 that they kicked off. Sean Hasler, drumming at the time, switched to bass when they met Alex Eynstone and he became the new drummer.
Towards the end of 2005, Internal Augmentation recorded a 4 track demo in Melbourne at Bayside Rehearsal Studios. When they returned they started gigging around Bairnsdale, until they eventually reached Sale and Traralgon.
By the end of 2006, a few changes had been made. Sean had parted with the band due to work commitments, and Tim Stewart had come in as the vocalist, until the band decided he wasn't suited and became a trio. They played as a trio for a little while, before they met Will Guarnaccia, who took up position of bass and main vocals.
