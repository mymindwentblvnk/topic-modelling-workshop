Long time comrades Tirade & C-Doc have been creating music and video works for many years. In 1994 they put a name to these curiosities and LOWdown was born. In 2006 they released their debut album on the SLAMjamz label: "groundZERO". groundZERO is a CD/DVD experience that attempts to recapture the breakbeat, bass-heavy Hip-Hop of the early 1990's mixed with the duo's trademark off-kilter humor. They followed the album up with the "dumpTRUCK EP". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lowdown">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
