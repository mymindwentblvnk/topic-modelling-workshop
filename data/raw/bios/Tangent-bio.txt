There are multiple artists named Tangent.

1) Hailing from The Netherlands, drummer and sound designer Ralph van Reijendam and vocalist and sound engineer Robbert Kok decided to combine their mutual interest in electronic music and write together under the name Tangent. The duo began combining their talents to meld acoustic instrumentation with electronic experimentation in a highly contrasting manner.
In 2013 they released their first album '1mk2' on Mindtrick Records. In 2014 Tangent signed to the U.S. electronic label Tympanik Audio for the release of their new album 'Transience'.

2) Deranged post-punk/deathrock solo project from Philadelphia, PA formed in 2018. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tangent">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
