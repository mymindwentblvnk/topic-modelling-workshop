The lead singer is been working on the band for several years and has lived a year in London where he has searched the true roots of garage-rock.
After playing a few years as amateurs, Mozes and the Firstborn started to receive a lot of attention from all the major Dutch record labels last year.
They built their own studio, quit side jobs and studied and spent months non-stop in their basement studio, practicing and creating new songs.
After this, they signed a good contract with the record label Top Notch. They have released their self-titled debut album on the 2nd of March. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mozes+and+the+Firstborn">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
