Tramwreck came to be in the fall of 2010 when four friends coming from bands such as Sista Skriket, Psychobrew and Bigger Better Bombs took the time to get together and start writing and rehearsing. The music is rough, simple hardcore drawing influence from classic hardcore acts as well as thrash metal and punk. The lyrical themes deal mostly with nuclear apocalypse, pledging your soul to Satan and dying in defense of your beer. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tramwreck">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
