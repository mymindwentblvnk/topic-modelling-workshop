Egrogsid began in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia in the year of 1990, originally under the name Disgorge. They started out doing covers of bands like Extreme Noise Terror, Napalm Death, Unseen Terror and others, as well as a few original songs. They played gigs locally in Hobart, and recorded a 6-track demo tape "Give the Sick More Say". The original members were Aaron Chesterton (high pitched vocals), Nick Hopwood (deep vocals), Erik Simonsen (guitar), Andrew Mckenzie (bass), and Chris Valentine (drums). David Bird started playing bass in the band after a while. After some time, Egrogsid moved to the mainland of Australia in 1991, playing gigs at various Melbourne venues. During this time,t there were lineup changes; Andrew McKenzie was back playing nass (Bird stayed in Tassie), and Nick also remained in Hobart, so Eugene Spurt took over the low vocal sound when the band moved to Melbourne. This is just the first chapter in the band's history. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Egrogsid">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
