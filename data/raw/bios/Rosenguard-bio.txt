In January 2003, the dreams of creating a melodic metal band that would transcend all musical boundaries was realized. Rosenguard began to write a collection of songs which would define human emotion and experience from their point of view. Rosenguard recorded their first album titled, "Till the End of Time" at Gravity Studios in Chicago Illinois. Shortly after its release in 2005, they were endorsed by Randall Amplifiers.

The new album, "Requiem For The Innocent", featuring the singles "Signal", "Requiem For The Innocent", and "Countless Ages". is now available!

Rosenguard's current lineup includes an eclectic mix of musicians from all over the world. Tomek Spirala (formerly of Downfall, 13th Step, Dreadlocked, and Ravensthorn), a native of Poland, is the band's lead guitarist. Nenad Lazic (formerly of Night on Armon and Amon Din), originally from Serbia, handles bass guitar. Nick Rogers (formerly of Cellpan, Immoral Habit, and Abomination), an American, is the vocalist and rhythm guitarist for Rosenguard. In 2007 the band enlisted the services of Chicago based drummer Garrett Scanlan (of Corpsevomit , Evil Incarnate, and Lividity fame) on the skins to complete their sound. With this lineup of talented professionals, Rosenguard is on its way to setting the metal scene on fire in 2007!
