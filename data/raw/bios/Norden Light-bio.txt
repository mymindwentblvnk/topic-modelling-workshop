A Hard Rock / Heavy Metal band from Gothenburg, Sweden. They released one album in 1987 entitled "Shadows From The Wilderness". The sound on the release is comparable to melodic metal acts of the time such as Dio and Yngwie Malmsteen.

NORDEN LIGHT was a melodic hard rock/metal band formed by Christer Mentzer and Michael von Knorring in the mid-80s. The group began under the name MENTZER until their manager BÃ¶rje Forsberg suggested that they change to the current name. NORDEN LIGHT had success in both Europe and Japan. They released an album on Sonet Records in 1987, 'Shadows from the Wilderness' and recorded two tracks (as MENTZER) for the compilation album 'Scandinavian Metal Attack II (1984)'. They also appeared with the song "No Escape" in the Italian film Opera from 1987.

NORDEN LIGHT drummer Michael Van Knorring later joined YNGWIE MALMSTEEN. The drummer would later unite with Italian frontman Chris Heaven for a 2002 band called EDGE OF TIME. 

In 2010 "Shadows From The Wilderness" was reissued with the 1995 cover on CD and as downloadable MP3s. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Norden+Light">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
