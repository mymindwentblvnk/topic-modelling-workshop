Raised from the ashes in the fall of 2008, we are Ebullition from Ocala Florida. We are not demons, politicians, vampires, witchdoctors, or any other scary creatures. We are four guys who love Metal, and want to be great at playing it. Our lyrics are about whatever comes to mind, and is interesting enough to write about. 

     Our members: Seth, Hildy, Sam, and Eddie came to the dark side of Metal at different times throughout it’s history; starting in the early nineties, and spanning the decade. That long and varied line of influences brews the dark, heavy, and sinister Metal that Florida has always been known for. 

     We have just released our latest album, The Suffered Testament, and we’re not slowing down. Plans are in the works to tour, and we’re already scratching the surface of the next album. Tell your local venues you want to see us, and we’ll see you in the pit! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ebullition">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
