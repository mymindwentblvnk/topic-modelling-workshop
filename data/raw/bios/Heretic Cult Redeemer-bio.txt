From seemingly out of nowhere - or a nameless abyss, at least - arrives Heretic Cult Redeemer, but the band actually comprises veterans from the fertile Greek black/death metal scene which includes such bands as Acrimonious, Necrovorous, and Embrace of Thorns. A torturous brew of innovative and poisonous Black Metal... Debut album via Iron Bonehead Productions.
