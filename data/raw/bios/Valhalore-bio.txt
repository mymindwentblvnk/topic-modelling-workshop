Valhalore is an epic metal band from Brisbane, Australia. Created by composer and lead guitarist Anthony Willis, Valhalore draw on influences from folk, power, and melodic death metal to create a sound that is both inspiring and magical.

Formed in mid-2013, the band immediately set to work on their first album and began to establish themselves within the Australian metal scene. In 2015 the band released their debut, self-titled EP which received positive acclaim from fans globally.

Since their first live appearance in November 2015, Valhalore have been a crowd favourite at numerous shows, and have shared the stage with the likes of Chronolyth, Kyzer Soze, Orpheus Omega, Lagerstein, Be’lakor, as well as opening for folk-metal titans Eluveitie.

“The band mixes the ferocity of melodic death metal, the intricacy of folk metal with the technical grace and wizardry of guitarists like Jari Mäenpää from Wintersun, for a sound that feels so organic yet inspiring.” – Metal Obsession.

Valhalore are due to release their first full-length album Voyage Into Eternity on March 14 2017.
