Daniel Caplen (born 27 March 1992 in London, England), better known as his stage name D/C or Dan Caplen, is a British R&B singer, songwriter and musician based in Brixton in London. He is signed to Atlantic Records UK and released his first track "Longing for You" on the label on 19 February 2016. 

Caplen was born in London to a mother from the Caribbean and an English father, and was educated at St Edmund's School Canterbury. He started playing the piano and the cello in his early teens, before getting interested in production and remixing. Caplen briefly left Britain to study in Portland, Oregon, a move which helped to inspire his approach as an artist.

In 2014, D/C self-released his debut EP, “Epiphany”, gaining the attention of Atlantic Records, who signed him to the label in the following year. He then released his first single “Longing For You” on the label in February 2016. The track is taken from his first Atlantic Records EP “Bad Man” released in 2016.

D/C supported UK electronic duo Honne on their UK tour in October 2015 as well as Anne-Marie on her UK tour in January/February 2016. D/C also performed at The Great Escape 2016 festival in Brighton, United Kingdom. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dan+Caplen">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
