Dynamite Deluxe is a German hip hop group hailing from Hamburg, consisting of the MC Samy Deluxe, producer Tropf and producer/DJ Dynamite (alias Joni Rewind). The name is a combination of DJ Dynamite and Samy Deluxe.

In 1997, the trio released their first mixtape "Dynamite Deluxe Demo", which was an 8-track EP produced in a very small amount but can still be heard on the EP "The Classic Vinyl Files". Between the release of their first and final album Deluxe Soundsystem followed in 2000, they produced several other EPs and mixtapes. Although Samy Deluxe left the group in early 2001, DJ Dynamite and Tropf still worked together and run the label Hamburgs Finest with him.
In 2007 they perfomed live for the first time after 6 years of stage abstinence at the Juice ten years anniversary birthday bash where they also announced their full reunion.
December 14th they presented their new single "Dynamit!" in the TV show MTV TRL XXL which will be in stores on January 11th, two weeks before the album "TNT" hits the stores. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dynamite+Deluxe">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
