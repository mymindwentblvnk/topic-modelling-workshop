While studying jazz together at NYC's Manhattan School of Music, Ivan Jackson & Conor Rayne linked up to form Brasstracks in 2014 as a side project to produce the music they were passionate about. Their songs and covers spread quickly through the internet, and since then, they have toured with Lido, Nao, Mr Carmack, Jack Garratt & GRiZ; played iconic venues & festivals such as Red Rocks & Coachella; made songs with GoldLink, Anderson Paak, Wyclef Jean, Lido & Khalid; and have dropped critically acclaimed music of their own.

In 2016 they produced arguably the biggest Hip-Hop record of the year - Chance The Rapper's ‘No Problem’ featuring Lil Wayne & 2Chainz. This led to GRAMMY nominations for Best Rap Song, adding to a nomination for writing on Anderson Paak’s ‘Am I Wrong’ & and one GRAMMY win for Best Rap Album for their contribution to Chance's ‘Coloring Book'. They also released their debut EP, Good Love. During a heavy summer ’17 festival season playing all over North America, they released part one of their most recent two-part project “For Those Who Know”, boasting collaborations with Robert Glasper, The Underachievers & more.

They kicked off 2018 with their first headline tour, playing 19 cities & selling out over half of them. With part II of “For Those Who Know” coming this summer, the year is about to get even bigger for these 2 Grammy winning musicians. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/brasstracks">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
