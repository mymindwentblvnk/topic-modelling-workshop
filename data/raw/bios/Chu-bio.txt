1. Chu is dense and deep stoner doom \ sludge with the influence of psychedelic rock and punk from Alma-Ata, Kazakhstan. The music of this band will take you away on the flows of unconsciousness, in close connection with your archaic! Heavy stream of riffs, psychedelic solos and dirty punk rush is cooked in one pot with the occult, esoteric texts of the band. Their creative activity is influenced by many bands and genres from the 60s psychedelic rock to progressive, punk and groove.The group draws inspiration from surrounding us illusion and non-duality of being. Hail to the great and whole Absolute!

2. Another artist named Chu is a french video games composer, which makes ethereal, mystical and ambiant music.
 Her compositions brings mystery, adventure and introspection at the same time.
