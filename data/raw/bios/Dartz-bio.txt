Dartz are a Math rock group from Middlesbrough in North East England (UK) who formed at the beginning of 2005 as "Darts!", later changed to "DARTZ!". Since the end of 2007 they are named "Dartz".
They are signed to Xtra Mile Recordings in the UK and Deep Elm in the US, and have to date released one full-length album, one mini-album, three singles and a split 7" via Xtra Mile - as well as an EP on Sunderland based DIY micro-label Fakedream Records and a split 10" with Scottish band Stapleton on Gravity DIP.

They have recorded with illustrious producer Mark Williams (Biffy Clyro, Bloc Party, Fightstar, Nine Black Alps, Million Dead etc.) at the world famous battery studios in London and they've toured with groups such as Get Cape. Wear Cape. Fly, Hot Club de Paris and The Rumble Strips, as well as also playing with bands including The Futureheads, Melt Banana, The Young Knives, Make Believe and Foals. More recently Dartz added long-time collaborator Nico Taylor, once the logistics man for the band, to the line-up.

In September 2007, the band announced that they were going to take a break from touring to focus on their education, with Maughan studying English Literature at Oxford University and Anderson studying English and Film at Sheffield Hallam. The decision was explained in an article in The Times newspaper entitled "Bands Balancing Uni With Fame", although it was criticised by the NME in the magazine's review of "The Sad History of the Village of Alnerique" in September 2008. Dartz have had three videos featured on MTV2, all of which were directed by Teesside University lecturer Marcus T. Diamond. A fourth video, for the track "Cold Holidays", was recorded by Wife Swap cameraman Rob Taylor during the band's tour with I Was a Cub Scout. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dartz">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
