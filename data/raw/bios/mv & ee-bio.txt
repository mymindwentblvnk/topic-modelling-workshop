MV & EE is a group of musicians focused around Matt Valentine, sometimes referred to as MV, and his partner Erika Elder. Matt Valentine was in the neo-psychedelic group, The Tower Recordings. While the duo record under many different names, including The MV/EE Medicine Show and MV & EE With The Bummer Road, most of the records center around both artists and feature a rotating cast of additional musicians. Their style is self-described as "lunar ragas", with many of the lyrics dealing with celestial imagery. They combine Indian raga style composition (with increasing authenticity as they become more accomplished with time) with Appalachian folk and post-psychedelic electrical experimentalism. They use Western and Eastern acoustic instruments amplified and augmented with effects such as reverb, delay, and flange. Their compositions occasionally feature vocals, which are off-kilter and rambling, while seeming drugged. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/MV+&+EE">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
