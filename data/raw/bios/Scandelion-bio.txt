Scandelion pushes past the normal confines of genres and “labels” with their unique and refreshing approach that can only be described as “Brutally beautiful”. Formed in 2002 by Jorge Afonso (Keyboards & Vocals), Scandelion takes its name from the ruins of a Greek fortress on the coast of Jerusalem. The band released their first demo in 2005 and their first album (The Pureheart’s Breed) in 2008. Three albums later, 2014 saw a dramatic lineup change following a relocation to the UK. Jorge was first joined by guitar virtuoso Fabrizio Ferraro. Lastly the band recruited drummer James Chapman. 2014 was also a huge year for the band’s sound. Scandelion transformed from the Gothic/Symphonic Doom metal of their roots into something far more aggressive and powerful. Their album “Nonsense” released in 2014 shows a darker, more intense incarnation of the band; showing that they can move seamlessly into the more extreme styles of metal while retaining their symphonic and doom metal influences. In 2017, two of the members of the classical line-up, Sonia Hernández and Ancor Amador, return to the band and a new album is released. "When Everything Turns Black" is a conceptual album about the transmigration of souls. with great pressence of classical guitars but keeping the essence of the band. Back in Canary Islands, the band will release its fifth full-length album during 2020.
