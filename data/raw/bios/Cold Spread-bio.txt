The German Metal/Hardcore Band Cold Spread was formed in 2001, emerging as the bloody rest of "Depressive World" and some new flesh  longing for musical expression. Based in the beautiful Ore Mountains Region in the East of Germany they brave the elements and rough winters with screaming guitars and hard riffs to spread the cold and heat the masses. 
They aren't vegan and love to play live gigs. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cold+Spread">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
