James Leusink (born April 13, 1990) commonly known by his stage name Ephixa, is a DJ and producer from Canada. 
It all started in September 2008 when a metal head met an aggressive form of electronic music called Hardstyle. Since then Ephixa has been working with different styles of electronic music. 
He is best known for his remix of "Lost Woods" from The Legend of Zelda game series. 

He is also known for being one of the co-founders of Monstercat. He is one of Monstercat's first signed artists and his song "Dubstep Killed Rock 'n' Roll" was the first song ever released on the label. He was also featured on several of Monstercat's compilation albums. 
He left Monstercat for 4 years with his song, "The Anthem", featured on Monstercat 009 Reunion with Varien & Project 46. The reason for leaving the label was because of a falling out between the staff and Ephixa which resulted in no more releases from him for a time.

He returned to Monstercat in July of 2016 with his track, "Matches" with Stephen Walking, which was featured on the 5 Year Anniversary album. He then later returned in 2017 with a track with Laura Brehm, called Losing You, his solo single on the Rocket League soundtrack, called Skyforth, and collaboration with Bossfight, called Subside. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ephixa">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
