Bobb Trimble (born 4 August 1958) is a psychedelic folk/outsider musician from Marlborough, Massachusetts. He released two full-length albums, Iron Curtain Innocence (1980) and Harvest of Dreams (1982), following which Trimble's recording activities ceased. His two albums, originally produced in quantities of 500 or less, became collectors items. 

Most of Trimble's public performances came in the very early 80s, around the time his two albums were released. Though his musical style differed from the punk rock bands in the "Wormtown" (Worcester, MA) scene, his oddball loner status made him fit in quite well with his musical peers. Wormtown is credited with inspiring him to release his first album, Iron Curtain Innocence, in 1980.

Trimble continued to record beyond his second album Harvest of Dreams, but he never again reached the amazing heights of these two original albums and this new material went mostly unreleased (Life Beyond the Doghouse, released by Orpheus Records of Denmark in 2002 is a notable exception). In 2000, he played guitar on "Buzz Bombb" on Abunai!'s Round-Wound album, and on their Deep Mu Flux +2 EP).

In November 2007, Secretly Canadian reissued Iron Curtain Innocence and Harvest of Dreams to significant acclaim.  The following year, Bobb played two shows (his first in over ten years) -- a combined set with The Prefab Messiahs at the Wormtown 30th Anniversary Bash, and an appearance with Bobb Trimble's Flying Spiders (Bobb's current band) at the Somerville MA stop of the Byron Coley-curated No More Bush Tour.  A sold-out show in Cambridge MA with Ariel Pink's Haunted Graffiti followed in April 2009.
