Seized of Darkness was a Christian Death/Black Metal band from the Northwest, specifically the Portland Metropolitan area of OR (with members ranging from Hood River to Tualatin). Formed near the end of 2006, at its peak, Seized of Darkness was comprised of Rodney Wilder (vocals), Curtis McTeigue (guitar/keys), Josh Nanocchio (guitar), Jared Nagreen (bass), and Jason Borton (drums). After several years of writing and performing, though, Seized of Darkness amicably disbanded in January of 2009.

Seized of Darkness was never conceived with the intention of being a single-genre band, with the members bringing a diverse array of influences (ranging from 80's Hair Metal to Progressive Rock and Symphonic Black Metal), but it was the single-mindedness of faith that brought the band together. The name refers to the Christian tenet of salvation, that in Jesus Christ, all who ask for forgiveness from sin are redeemed and, thus, seized from the darkness of death and condemnation. The band, no matter what musical styles and influences were brought it, was driven by the sole desire to glorify God and spread the Gospel through Metal (in all forms).

Writing and rehearsing a little over one album's worth of material, Seized of Darkness recorded their demo, the  "From Silver Spires" EP, which was three chosen tracks from what would have been the first full-length album to follow, based on an elaborate narrative conceived by the band to creatively share the significance of salvation in Christ. The full-length album never was recorded, but an additional non-conceptual track entitled "Gehenna" was also recorded shortly before disbanding. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Seized+of+Darkness">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
