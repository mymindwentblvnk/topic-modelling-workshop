Septic Scum is a Slovenian groovy death/grind (mixed with some gore and crust) band. They call their musical style “scumgrind”. Septic Scum was formed in april 2007 as a side project of two diffrent bands. After only one month they have had their first gig in home town Sevnica with other bands like Vulvathrone, Ambassador Of Sifilis, Martyrdom and Necrology. The response from the public was awesome, so the band decided that this is it. They have disbaned other two bands and Septic Scum became their main project. The abuse has started and you can not stop it!!!
