UZALA was born in the summer of 2009 in the guts of a giant bombshelter nestled within a sage covered hill in Boise, Idaho. It is here where the vision for the band come to reality.

UZALA writes and plays a form of psychedelic down-tempo, "Doom" metal. Influenced by a number of world renowned metal bands, we have brought our best to the table to bring it all together in to a unique and heavy sound.
