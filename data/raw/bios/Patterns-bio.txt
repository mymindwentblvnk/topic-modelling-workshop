1) Patterns used to be a band who claimed they liked to make loud music in darkly lit rooms. But out of the darkness came light, and the shimmering glory of their 2010 debut release, New Noise. So good that it convinced Manchester ‘zine makers Pull Yourself Together to set up a record label to facilitate its release. The spacious, celestial sound they’ve captured has since seen acclaim pour in from all the right places; Huw Stephens already suitably impressed enough to invite them down to play his night at The Social in March.

There are more than enough bands around at the moment who know how to piece together a melody, but Patterns deal as much in song craft as they do in suppression and release. Using the kind of woozy ambience that a thousand lonely chillwave artists would move out of their parents’ bedroom to capture as a canvas, the group create something moody, atmospheric and almost without peer.

The band signed to Melodic Records in May 2011.
