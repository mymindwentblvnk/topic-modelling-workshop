1). NOISE / DRONE project started in 2008 by a musician from Chicago (USA). Since then he has already recorded fifty seven albums, most of them in mp3 format and avaible totally free. His syle is a balance between harsh noise and ambient soft sounds. His b-side project Drommord is much more agressive and totally "harsh noise wall".
