Forklift is from Austin, TX.  Forklift formed in 1996 and played their last live show in 2001.  Their style was hardcore/metal with a heavy blues and southern rock influence.  The 'Deluxe EP' was released in 2000.  A few of the tracks have are available here on Last.fm


Seems there was another Forklift as well:

Forklift was an Eastern Connecticut punk band in the early-to-mid 1990s, stalwarts of the scene that included bands like Maude, Ben Hur, Mi6, and Big Mistake. Forklift released a 7" EP on scene-defining Vandal Children Records, had a song on the "A Dent in the General Mentality" compilation, and released a cassette EP that featured a recording of their crowd-pleasing cover of the Screeching Weasel song "Supermarket Fantasy." After they broke up, Forklift's drummer, Jay Adelberg, went on to play for The Queers and Ready the Jet. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Forklift">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
