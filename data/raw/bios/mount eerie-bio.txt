Mount Eerie represents the latest evolution of Phil Elverum's musical vision.  Formerly known as The Microphones, Phil changed his project's name to Mount Eerie while maintaining his subtle, lo-fi, and lyrically dense fuzz-folk aesthetic.  

Elverum explained this change in an 2003 interview with Discorder, asserting that "Mount Eerie is a new project. The Microphones was completed, or at least at a good stopping point. I did it because I am ready for new things. I am new."

As Mount Eerie, Phil typically works with synthesizers, guitars, drums, and the accenting voices of Mirah, The Blow, and fellow K-Records/Anacortes, Washington friends. Mount Eerie's album "Seven New Songs of Mount Eerie" was also the first recording released on Phil's new label, P.W.Elverum & Sun.  All songs from that recording are available for free download in the Internet Archive. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mount+Eerie">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
