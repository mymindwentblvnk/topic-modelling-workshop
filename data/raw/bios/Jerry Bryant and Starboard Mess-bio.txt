Jerry Bryant is a native of the State of Maine who for the last 30 years has performed folk music all over the United States. Performing on guitar, concertina, banjo, melodeon and other acoustic instruments, his repertoire includes hundreds of traditional and contemporary folk songs, with a particular interest in the music of sailors. Jerry enjoys giving people a glimpse of our maritime heritage through the songs he presents. He carefully researches the material, so that his performances are not only full of good music but are peppered with historical insights as well. Jerry writes songs, too, using the tradition as inspiration and actual people and events as subjects.

Jerry has been featured in the San Francisco National Maritime Historic Park’s sea music concert series, Mystic Seaport Museum’s annual Sea Music Festival, South Street Seaport in New York, and many others. His recording The Ballad of Harbo and Samuelsen showcases old and new songs. He can also can be heard on the Mystic Seaport CD American Sea Chanteys, and on Contentment by Rick Spencer. His latest release, Roast Beef of Old England, is a collection of traditional songs from the man-of-war days of the British Navy, and is a companion to the seafaring novels of Patrick O’Brian. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jerry+Bryant+and+Starboard+Mess">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
