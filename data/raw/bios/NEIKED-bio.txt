The Swedish experimental pop collective NEIKED seduced listeners around the world with their 2016 dance-pop come-on “Sexual.”

• NEIKED is the brainchild of singer, songwriter, and producer Victor Rådström. The Stockholm native formed a collective of singers, songwriters, and producers to release songs that were “too bold or different” for other artists.
• The collective’s breakthrough came with the 2016 single “Sexual,” featuring English singer-songwriter Dyo. “Sexual” charted around the world, peaking at No. 5 in the UK and narrowly missing the Top 20 of Billboard’s Hot Dance/Electronic Songs chart in the US.
• Featuring a mix of previously released singles and new songs, NEIKED’s debut album, Best of Hard Drive, arrived in 2019. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/NEIKED">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
