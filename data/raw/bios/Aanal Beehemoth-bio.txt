Aanal Beehemoth started early 2007 in a cold totally dark small town by a couple of psychically superpowered luthiers. The actions took place in a paranoia inducing flat where drums were set and improvisational jams were kicked out in a hard and impulsive way. Poltergeist attacked the apartment, being situated next to old burialgrounds. There are ghouls of dead souls walking from room to room. Listen to Aanal carefully - hear the agony of hell & cold sweat caught on analog tape. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Aanal+Beehemoth">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
