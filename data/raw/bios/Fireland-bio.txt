Fireland are a twin lead guitar heavy metal band, drawing on all the influences of over thirty years of heavy metal. Based in Northern Ireland, UK, the band will not let their location on the outskirts of Europe stand in the way of bringing their own brand of riff-based, powerful and melodic metal to the rest of the continent.
The band was formed in the summer of 2003, and features members with a rich musical pedigree, having played with Irish metal favourites, Riff Master General, Ahriman and PHM, to name but a few.

To date, the band has played with metal legends such as DragonForce, Blitzkrieg and Jeff Scott Soto. In previous bands, members have toured with Kreator and played alongside Blaze, Doro, Rose Tattoo and Girlschool.
Fireland have just released their third CD, a free four track EP in the run up to the launch of their second album, and are continuing to play gigs in the UK & Ireland, with trips to the continent high on the agenda.
