Genre: Industrial Black / Death Metal

NEXUS INFERIS encompasses a master design of future extreme metal. Savage yet imaginative guitar riffs and relentless battery churn at the core of this cold dystopian death machine. Surrounded and cursed by devices of sinister orchestration, dynamic textures and digital sound designs. Possessed by a vocal threat spanning both human and non-human spectrums. N.I have been working on their debut release "A VISION OF THE FINAL EARTH" which promises to deliver a spark of innovation into the arena of extreme metal. This creatures comes to life on stage 2012!
