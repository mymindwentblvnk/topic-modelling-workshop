Death By Ki, formerly Peristalsis, are a 4 piece metal band bringing together the tastes of brutal death metal to the more melodic yet thrashy sides on the other end of the scale. Regular, structured practises have infused an extremely tight and energetic live set. Four members - Drew Armstrong (Lead Guitar, Backing Vocals), Josh Ayerst (Rhythm Guitar, Vocals), Will Robins (Bass, Backing Vocals) and Nicky C (Drums) got their influence from bands like Shadows Fall, Lamb Of God, Metallica, Killswitch Engage, Megadeth, Pantera, Linkin Park, Enter Shikari, Trivium, Testament and others. 

D.B.K have so far toured the Czech Republic on two occassions and played various venues across the South West of England.
