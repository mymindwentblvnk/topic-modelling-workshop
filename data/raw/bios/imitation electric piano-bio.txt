Imitation Electric Piano was formed in 1999 by Stereolab bassist Simon Johns and Andrew Blake (guitar). They recorded their eponymous instrumental first E.P. (DS45-CD27) for Duophonic Super 45s, part of Duophonic Ultra High Frequency Discs, that year. Their first full-length album, Trinity Neon (DS45-CD33) was released in 2002. Line-ups have included Ashley Marlowe on drums (Charlottefield), Dominic Jeffery on keyboards (Stereolab), Paul Morgan on guitar, David Campbell on keyboards ("I'm Being Good"), and more recently Joe Watson on keyboards (also in Stereolab) and singer Mary Hansen. The line-up now includes Etien Rodes on bass, Jo Bramli on vocals and Lee Adams on drums. Sometimes compared to Stereolab, their music is characterised by an emphasis on bass driven instrumentals, layered melodies and expressive drums. However, restricted recording budgets and and a more pronounced interest in 70s rock, especially Soft Machine, has produced a rawer sound.

The band's second LP, Blow It Up, Burn It Down, Kick It 'Til It Bleeds, was released on October 16, 2006.

The group has been on a hiatus since Simon relocated to Istanbul. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Imitation+Electric+Piano">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
