Vintersorg is a Swedish progressive folk/avant-garde metal band formed in 1994 in Skellefteå, Sweden under the name Vargatron (Wolfthrone in English), but was later changed to Vintersorg.

The sound of Vintersorg has vastly changed over the years, as his demo and first three albums, Hedniskhjärtad, Till Fjälls and Ödemarkens Son being folk/viking metal with black  metal influence where their more recent albums, Cosmic Genesis, Visions from The Spiral Generator and The Focusing Blur are more progressive and influenced strongly by 60s/70s progressive rock. The album Solens Rötter took both the folk and progressive sound and mixed it into a more unique style.

The name "Vintersorg" has often confused people in the metal scene due to it being the BAND name and the NICKNAME of the front man and composer, Andreas Hedlund. The actual band Vintersorg consists of Andreas Hedlund and Mattias Marklund, with regular appearances from Jan Erik Torgersen, Steve DiGiorgio, Asgeir Mickelson and Lars Are Nedland.

Andreas Hedlund (Vintersorg/Mr. V) is constantly creating music. He is the front-man of several bands including Vintersorg, Otyg (folk metal), Borknagar (progressive black metal), Havayoth (gothic metal), Fission (melodic death metal), Cronian (progressive metal),  Waterclime (progressive rock/jazz) and Cosmic Death (black/thrash/death metal).

The name Vintersorg means "winter sorrow". It's a character from the Isfolket series, by the author Margit Sandemo. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vintersorg">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
