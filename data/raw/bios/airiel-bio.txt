Airiel began as a solo project by Jeremy Wrenn in Bloomington, Indiana, in 1997. For a few years, Airiel was a duo: Wrenn on guitar, Sean Delaney on bass and a drum machine. Wrenn then relocated to Chicago and brought in Cory Osborne (bass) and John Rungger (drums), followed by Chris De Brizzio (guitar). The current lineup includes Wrenn and Andrew Marrah (of New Canyons).

Through Clairecords (Sacramento), Airiel released a series of four-song EPs titled Winks & Kisses. The EPs were also sold as a limited edition boxed set, capturing the evolution of Airiel in its current form. Their CDs are consistently some of the top sellers of the label, and the Frosted EP has already sold out. The group has also been asked to contribute to several compilation CDs, including Never Lose That Feeling by Club AC30 (U.K.).

In addition to their recordings, Airiel has also gained a reputation for being a live band. In addition to playing such local Chicago landmarks as the Double Door, Subterranean, and the Bottom Lounge, they have performed in Minneapolis, Milwaukee, Denver, Pittsburgh and Indianapolis. They have toured the U.S. East Coast, performing in New York City, Washington D.C., Philadelphia, and points in between. Airiel has also opened for some high-profile acts, including The Dears and The Brian Jonestown Massacre. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Airiel">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
