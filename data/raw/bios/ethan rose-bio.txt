Ethan Rose is a musician, sound-artist, faux-pilot, and aspiring gardner who resides in portland, oregon - the biggest little town on the western coast of the usa. His music reflects his varied interests in old technologies, new sounds, and all things both inside and out. Much of ethan's music has centered around his fascination with automated instruments from years long past, including things like music boxes, player pianos, and carillons. Although, don't be mistaken - he is more interested in pulling new sounds and ideas out of these old and varied devices rather than treating them with a sense of preservation. Not to say that he doesn't appreciate them for what they are, only that he is more interested in linking their histories to the modern age for the love of the sounds that they make. 
Alongside his interest in making old sounds new, ethan has also taken great interest in combining music with images. The countless forms of beauty that result from linking film and music has held a strong allure for him ever since he first discovered an 8mm film projector stored away in his parents attic so many years ago. Since then he has had the good fortune to collaborate and work with a number of wonderful directors including Gus Van Sant, Ryan Jeffery, and Chel White.

Besides making music, ethan also enjoys the natural world in all its splendor, cooking and eating delicious food, bridging gaps, reading books, spending time with friends and loved ones, and making music with the band Small Sails.
