Not many artists get to experience as many pop lives as Teddy Geiger. She was a teen idol by 16, with a mushy soft-rock hit, “For You I Will (Confidence),” on her hands. After an early retirement at 21, she took a few steps back out of the spotlight and began writing songs for and with other artists, most famously becoming one of the names behind Shawn Mendes’ biggest hits (“Stitches,” “Treat You Better”).

But after spending the majority of her twenties outside the spotlight, Geiger has found herself back in it. She’s become one of pop’s most sought-after songwriters, adding a touch of rawness to the pop sheen of stars like One Direction (“Little Black Dress”), Lizzo (“Fitness”), Anne-Marie (“Machine”), Christina Aguilera (“Unless It's with You”) and 5 Seconds of Summer (“Woke Up in Japan”). Now, she’s back in the game at the front of the stage, with her album Lillyanna — named for an alter ego she once used online — and the stage name Teddy<3, chosen because it looked “cute.” <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/teddy%3C3">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
