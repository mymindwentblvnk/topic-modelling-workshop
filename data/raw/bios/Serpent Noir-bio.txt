Born out of magical experiences, SERPENT NOIR is a musical expression of the dark side and the infamous Draconian Tradition (the Draconian Current). Based in Athens, Greece, this project has its roots in older black metal and ritual music.

Their first mini album, SANGUIS XI, was released by Daemon Worship Productions in 2010. Having recruited Belfagor of OFERMOD & NEFANDUS into the band, SERPENT NOIR released their first full length album with the intriguing title, SEEING THROUGH THE SHADOW CONSCIOUSNESS: OPEN UP THE SHELLS, in 2012 and the split album, GATEWAY TO THE NIGHTSIDE, with the Mexican ANDRAMELECH in 2013, again by Daemon Worship Productions. They are soon to begin working on their second full length with the well-known occult author and leader of the magical order Dragon Rouge, Thomas Karlsson, responsible for the lyrical content of the album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Serpent+Noir">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
