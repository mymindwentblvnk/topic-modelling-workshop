Nefarious Baptism is a 1-man brutal death/experimental/hypergrind project from Stockton, California, USA. The filth arose from a mixture of creativity and extreme boredom. All guitars, vocals, drum programming, artwork, songwriting, production, and distribution is done by Nefarious Baptism mastermind Ricky Piccirilli. The equipment used is a simple PC and piece of shit generic guitar. The mission? To create ultimate gut-blasting brutality (while incorporating a sense of humor. Because let's face it ... why be serious?)
