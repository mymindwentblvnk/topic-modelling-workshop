Forming a dark horizon to the musical landscape, Meltgsnow's (pronounced Melting Snow) was formed in 1999, standing out in the Asian Goth-Metal scene with their dark, progressive and intense approach to metal. Their evolution as a band has created a completely unique sound, characterized by a mix of melody with aggressive dark rhythm and intense vocals.

Their debut album “Insanity”, was released on Sonic Wave Records in 2003 to rave reviews, followed with a successful tour in the United States. Known for their live intensity and wild antics on stage, Meltgsnow has garnered a faithful following in Thailand and Singapore with positive fan and press feedback.

In late 2008 the band returned to the studio to record their highly-anticipated album, “Black Penance”. Exploring a dark musical landscape, their first single from that album“Empty Sky”, received national radio airplay and good reviews from fans and local media. “Black Penance” is currently scheduled for release at the mid of 2010, and will be followed by a tour planned for 2010.
