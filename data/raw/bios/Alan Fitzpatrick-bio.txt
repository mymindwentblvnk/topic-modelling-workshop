Alan Fitzpatrick is a talented producer from Southampton also home to the likes of James Zabiela and James Talk. His debut release '9 Hours Later' on his own 8 Sided Dice label has been in the Beatport techno top 10 for some time and has received support from Pete Tong on his Essential Selection show on Radio 1 as well as a long list of A list DJ's including Sasha, Dubfire and John Digweed who has since asked Alan to remix a Mistress Barbara track for his legendary Bedrock label.
Look out for Alan's massive 'Green Light' track coming soon on Tokio Recordings with an awesome remix from Patch Park. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Alan+Fitzpatrick">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
