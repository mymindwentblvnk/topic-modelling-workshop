Ceolskog is the folk metal project of Adam Helliwell, a singer and guitarist from New Zealand. Ceolskog's style, a cross between traditional folk and heavy metal, could be described as a mix of Thin Lizzy, Bathory, The Proclaimers and Ensiferum.

Ceol means music in Irish, and skog means forest in Norwegian. Although a solo project for now, it will hopefully become an entire band in the future.   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ceolskog">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
