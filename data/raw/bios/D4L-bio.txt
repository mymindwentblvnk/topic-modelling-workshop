D4L was an American rap group. They were composed of Fabo (now known as 2$ Fabo), Mook-B, Stoney and Shawty Lo. They are best known for their hit song "Laffy Taffy," which reached number-one in the U.S. in 2006.

Rapper Shawty Lo self-funded the group in its early days. He explained that the group's name stands for "Down for Life". D4L signed to the independent Dee Money Entertainment, which released the group's debut in conjunction with Asylum Records.The group debuted with "Betcha Can't Do It Like Me", which Billboard claimed to have popularized snap music. In January 2006, D4L's single "Laffy Taffy" reached the top of the Billboard Hot 100 chart. According to columnist L. Brent Bozell III, the song contained references to oral sex; Bozell considered the song "infected with a serious case of stupid".
