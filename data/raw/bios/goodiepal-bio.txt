Goodiepal (Gæoudjiparl), whose real name is Kristian Vester, is a Scandinavian electronica musician.

Goodiepal’s music always deals with subjects such as death and life. His output is many-faceted, complex and chaotic.

Goodiepal’s first full-length CD, vip. ibex (1992-1995), was released under the band name Circulation of Events back in 1995 on the Spoof Records label.

From the late 90’s Goodiepal was and still is connected to the English hardcore-vegan label and media manipulator V/Vm with whom he did the now famous Goodiebag/Demonbag 7” series, a series of over ten 7”s. On these discs he collected some of the finest and darkest of Scandinavian electronic oddities. He later released a series of manipulated brand sounds under the name "Mainpal", on the V/Vm label.

In 2001 the French label SKI-PP, run by DAT Politics, released a compilation of the Goodiepal work called Narc Beacon, which for a Scandinavian artist got a tremendous amount of press and today is considered one of the most important releases in modern Scandinavian music.
