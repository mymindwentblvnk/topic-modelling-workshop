There are 2 entries for Harem:

1. Harem are a well known Turkish percussion group.
And also a band born in 1998 in Castel Bolognese (Ravenna - Italy), and finally gain the actual line-up in 2002. We've had a lot of local and national contests, with some good results. We've also make an exhibition at the Heineken Jammin' Festival in 2003. We've constantly played our music and covers in pubs, venues and events... everywhere in last years. Then we decided to create our music and start write new songs. So we recorded our first album LiberaMusica LibereIdee in 2005. Our songs, our sounds, our passions! Our lyrics are directed to the human person, in order to the exhort him to find his "ego" and explode his energy all around... just like a rebel! There's also a little kind of loneliness... dark moments in a sunshine summer, where strange melodies walk side by side with "painted" words...
