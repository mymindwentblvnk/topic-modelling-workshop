Maybird came together in 2013 around the recording of their debut album Down & Under. Previously, singer/songwriter Josh Netsky had recorded a few albums as a solo artist with fellow members Sam Snyder (guitar) and brother Adam Netsky (drums). Upon the joining of Kurt Johnson (pedal steel/guitar) and Mike Schuler (bass) the group found themselves moving toward a psychedelic, rootsy, eclectic sound that would set the tone for the album that followed. 


Rochester City Newspaper’s Frank Deblase describes the record as “a carefully constructed wash of singer-songwriter insight and pop-psychedlia. It’s the sound of the beautiful and the weird sharing a slow dance - or a joint.” Recently the Netsky brothers have relocated to Brooklyn and the group has maintained a state-wide recording and performing agenda. They are currently in the midst of recording their follow up album, Things I Remember From Earth, set to be released later this year. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Maybird">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
