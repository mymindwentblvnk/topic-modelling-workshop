Born out of a boozy night where Shane (guitar) and Aidan (vocals) sat talking about how they should start a fucking mean crossover band, the two quickly recruited Ben on bass and Timoney on drums to start thrashing out the songs that would eventually become the Yeti Smasher split tape. Two years later they ended, leaving nothing behind but an album and a handful of chorus fuelled boozy memories. 

A bunch of shitty dudes who wanted to play some thrash got together, had some practises, wrote some songs and starting playing shows.
