Formed in the wake of thousands of demon's mutilated bodies, Awake the Suffering is a light plunged deep into the crevices of darkness. With an onslaught of brutal metal driven by their passion for Christ and the spreading of His love and grace, ATS attacks the stage with enough raw energy and ferocity to level buildings in their wake. The vicious guitars of Jason, the ground-pounding bass of Fuzz, the thunderous drums of Jeff, and the other-worldly screams and gutterals of Myk come together to form a machine that no legion of the underworld can stand against. With their talents showing forth in their music and their stage presence, ATS puts forth everything they have in their shows for God, themselves, and the fans. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Awake+The+Suffering">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
