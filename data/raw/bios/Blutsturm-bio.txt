Blutsturm was founded first in the year of 2005 under the name of "Irminsul". One year after that we changed the name into "Blutsturm" and started playing and redorded 2 songs, but we had no drummer at that time and also many problems with the line-up (Vrikryss -former 2nd guitarist- splitted up). So our motivation was lost somewhere and so Graenar & Haglaz decided to lay down their work in the beginning of 2007.
Later in 2007 Graenar and Haglaz not only decidet to regroup, but also would like to welcome Khan as our newest member! He will play the drums from now on.
And also back from the ashes is Vrikryss, who from now on will take the duty as bassplayer!  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Blutsturm">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
