Bent Sea, the grindcore ensemble led by drummer/guitarist Dirk Verbeuren (Soilwork, Scarve, Aborted, ...) and featuring Devin Townsend (Strapping Young Lad, Devin Townsend Project, ...)  on bass and Sven De Caluwe (Aborted, System Divide, In-Quest) on vocals... So basicly a lofi and oldschool all-star grindcore project..
