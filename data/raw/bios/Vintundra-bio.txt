Vintundra was founded in the summer of 2008 by Marvin (Drums) and Sebastian (Guitar). Short time after, Martin (Guitar) joined the band. In the late summer of 2010 Kevin became the vocalist of Vintundra and in fall of the same year Jan completed the line-up as Bass player.

The compositions of Vintundra have their main focus on melodic-technical Death Metal, with influences from Scandinavia to the Middle East. The lyrics are written in German and Swedish. The songs deal mostly with Norse mythology but there can also be found Sumerian and Egyptian themes in both lyrics and music.

In late 2010 the Band unleashed their first Demo, containing three tracks. Also there will be several live appearances in early 2011 as well as in the summer of the same year.
Vintundra is stronger than ever and ready to hit the stages.
