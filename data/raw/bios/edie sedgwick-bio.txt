1. Edith Minturn "Edie" Sedgwick was an American actress, socialite, model, and heiress who starred in several of Andy Warhol's short films in the 1960s.

2. Edie Sedgwick is the transgendered reincarnation of a vacuous Andy Warhol Superstar who died of a barbiturate overdose in 1971. A visionary artist, Edie was reborn at the dawn of the New Millenium to save the world by singing, writing, and producing video about celebrities. Armed with a video projector, her precious iMovies, and an occasional backing band, Edie travels through the dark American night presenting auditory and visual art that honors the likes of Angelina Jolie, Robert Downey, Jr., Paris Hilton, Martin Sheen, and other celebrity co-conspirators. If smarter, edgier, more ridiculous, more serious, more compelling art has been made, is being made, or will ever be made, Edie is not aware of it.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Edie+Sedgwick">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
