Artists Biography -

Faethon is a one-man band formed by Apollo in Summer 2004. The main idea for forming the project was the strive to unite all people of Indo-European, Aryan, or whatever you may call it - descent, and to overcome some mistakes and hostilities of the past that have always kept us divided. The main lyrical concept is Heathenism, as an alternative way of thinking and living, as well as spiritual enlightenment, and cultural action against the modern decadent world and materialistic western pseudo-values. A call to our ancestors and our blood, our right for self-determination and freedom. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Faethon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
