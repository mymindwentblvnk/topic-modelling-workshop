1) Driven was a hardcore punk band based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The group disbanded in 2001. 
Driven recorded their only official release, Cowardice Consumer of the West, in 1998. For their 2001 European tour they released a two-song demo CD independently. Their musical style can rather be described as metal than hardcore, however their idealistic message kept them inside the hardcore punk scene where they had sprang from in 1996.

2) There was also a nu metal band from Los Angeles fronted by Timm Saxton. From the Tracy G. website:

"In 1999 Tracy starting writing new songs. He went to the Whisky A Go Go one night with a friend where her brother was singing in a band called 'Snack'. He approached Timm Saxton and asked if he would be interested in writing to Tracy's music. Timm was very cool and said yes. Tracy and Timm have written over 50 songs. They put out one CD on Tracy's label and one on MTM Records, Germany. The band is called 'Driven'. They are working on CD #3 now... it should be out in 2004. Larry Dennison hooked up the bass position and shares in some song writing, and Ray Luzier takes care of the drumming. Mike Terrana did the drumming on the 'Self Inflicted' CD on the MTM Germany release."

The band has since changed name to Goaded.
