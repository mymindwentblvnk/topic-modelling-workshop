Calvin Love is a Canadian singer-songwriter from Edmonton, Alberta. 

 He started a punk band in the northern Canadian city of Edmonton at the age of thirteen. The oppressively long, dark, and cold winters kept him indoors making madcap music while summer nights found him tearing up the sleepy streets with rock ‘n’ roll fueled adrenaline. Friends would say he was born with a rebel heart.

After the early years, he left town and has been on the road for the last five years touring dive bars and clubs throughout the US, playing in various bands in and out of Los Angeles. During this time, he managed to create a collage of visions, sounds, and scattered tracks while writing and recording in his bedroom studio, motels, bus stations, or wherever the road happened to lead.

His debut record New Radar, featured backing influences of pop and dance music of the 50’s and 60’s, as well as the punk/electronic/new wave of the late 70’s and 80’s, Calvin Love’s music is a sonic escape into psychological mysteries and enlightened tales of love and death.

His interests lie in photography, aesthetics, the paranormal, technological adaptations, pirates, The Goonies, zombie apocalypse, Jarmusch, strange states, dancing girls, sleepless nights, D.I.Y., Iggy, Bowie, tombs, hitchhiking, black & white, and the space-time continuum… <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Calvin+Love">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
