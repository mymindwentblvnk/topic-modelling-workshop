Slow, old-school doom death with a lot of references to Thergothon, including Lovecraftian concepts! Foetor is sort of regarded as a Thergothon tribute band. Quite promising one-man project and will for sure appeal to fans of Thergothon. Anybody into Funeral Doom should also check this project out, you will not be disappointed. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Foetor">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
