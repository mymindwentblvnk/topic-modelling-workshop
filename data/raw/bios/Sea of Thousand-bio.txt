Hailing From Austin, Texas Sea of Thousand was a short lived, albeit sucessful band within the sludge and hardcore scenes. With Members from Previous bands Employer, Employee and Dragbody they were not by any means beginners at music, and that showed in their highly refined, inventive brand of Blackened and Heavy-Metal Influenced Sludge.

After disbanding members went their own ways and formed Warwolf and Cardinale.  However, as of 2008 Sea of Thousand has reformed and is currently working on new material.  The lineup reamains the same with the exception of a new drummer, Luke Abbey, formerly of many excellent bands, most notably the Gorilla Biscuits.  Look for them to start playing shows again in June.
