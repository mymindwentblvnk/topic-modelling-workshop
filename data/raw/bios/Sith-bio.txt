Sith was born in 2007.  The only thing we know at the moment is that .Holly. (Sp√§ke) has joined him onstage. They don't tell us anymore about the mysterious Sith. 
Sith doesn't know what he did before, or what he will be doing tomorrow. Sith only exists for today. "Impulsive" would be the word to best describe this artist. 
SITH's universe is dark-symphonic and electro metal. Both tortured and melancholic, he brings us to a black dream-world and presents us with his most secret madness. 
Sith is not an artist that we just talk about. We are compelled to listen to him! 

Recording sessions for the next album have commenced as of February 10th, 2011.
