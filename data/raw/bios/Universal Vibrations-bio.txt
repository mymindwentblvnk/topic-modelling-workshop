Universal Vibrations are an alternative/funk/rock/electronic three-piece band consisting of Luke (lead vocal, guitars), James (bass guitar) and Jim (drums). They play a diverse and challenging range of tunes from the Hip-Hop styled ‘Tin Foil Bling’, the anthemic, yet ambient ‘Lonely Alien’, the ‘Beckish’ epic ‘Ain’t Got No Soul’ through to the all out synth- rock of ‘No Light No Sound’.

Universal Vibrations have taken all the good bits and pieces from pop, rock, funk, jazz, country, rap, hip-hop, electro and just about everything else and they've carefully, yes very carefully, re-written the rule book. When listening to each of the their tracks it becomes ever more clear that the music they make is a genuine attempt at something modernistic, fresh and boundary-felling.

The band has been developing for almost three years now and originally started as a studio project with front man Luke working on the tracks with producer Professor Gong at footworkz studios. Since then, after experimenting with a variety of live set-ups, UV has emerged as a talented group of musicians playing as many live gigs as possible and working towards their first album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Universal+Vibrations">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
