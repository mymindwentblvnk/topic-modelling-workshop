Arvinger is a Christian two-man band from Norway. The music is a mix between viking and black metal.

The band was formed in 2001 by Djerv (vocals) and Hauk. They made their debut in 2004 with the self-released album "Helgards Fall". Ronny Tegner from Pagans Mind played keyboards on this album while Hauk played the rest of the instruments.

The album got pretty good critiques in spite of a rather poor sound quality. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Arvinger">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
