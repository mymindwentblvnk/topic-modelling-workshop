In the summer of 2004 never-before heard sounds erupted from the small town of Columbus, Wisconsin. Three musicians merged their different music styles to create a mix of Dimmu Borgir and Tool with a raw batch of classical sauce.

Cody Stein is the backbone of the band with his original blast beats, march-like rhythms, and distinct tribal undertones.

Jacob Smith brings the low end melodies to the band with his exceptional bass talent. Dark and funky bass riffs give the band an original and fresh sound.

Steven Moser, on vocals and guitar, brings a true metal sound. His riffs will keep you on your toes, and his death/black-metal infused style is easily identified. His guttural growls and throaty vocals definitely lodge the band in the metal underground.

Withering Youth is not confined to a specific genre of metal; rather, the band covers everything from blistering speeds to dark melodies, and even produces some upbeat harmonies. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Withering+Youth">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
