Wongraven is a medieval ambient solo project from Oslo, Norway, founded in 1994 by Satyricon frontman Sigurd 'Satyr' Wongraven.
The only album released so far, "Fjelltronen", was published in 1995. It consists of keyboard-based music with a medieval atmosphere. Satyr plays most of the instruments himself, as well as the vocals. The keyboards and grand piano are played by Ihsahn (vocalist of Emperor), and the percussion by Hans K.K. Sørensen.

A song titled "Walking Away From the End of the World", composed by both Satyr and Espen Enger (of  Päronsoda), was released under the name Wongraven vs Päronsoda on the "Moonfog 2000: A Different Perspective" compilation (Moonfog Productions, 2000). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wongraven">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
