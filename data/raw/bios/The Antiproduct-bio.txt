Biography
The band was initially started by Max Kernegger (Guitar) and Hannes Schagl (Ex-Kickdown), with the aim of creating modern, yet timeless Melodic Death Metal. Later on, Peter Durst, popular in the Austrian underground scene because of his work as guitarist with Darkside, joined the band as second guitarist and vocalist. As a result of his musical background, the band developed an Old-School touch by adding characteristic elements to the band’s style. This now consisted of a mixture of Old-School Death Metal and more modern elements of metal. With Benjamin Koblizek a first permanent drummer was found at the beginning of 2006. At that time the band was able to play their first concerts. Based on the above Line-Up, a first demo was recorded in 2007. After the recordings, the band’s Bassist (Hannes Schagl) was replaced by Alexander Ruess (Ex-Midgard-Upgraded) and a vocalist was found with Andreas Schekulin, who had been able to distinguish himself with a number of bands. The band could now play a number of gigs, which contributed to a rise of the band’s popularity. At the beginning of 2009 the band’s rhythm section was replaced, and with the new members, Michael Morgenbesser (Bass) and Oliver Wondrusch (Drums), the band experienced a new level of motivation and started work on their first full-length album titled „Fear Machine“, which was released in june 2012 <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Antiproduct">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
