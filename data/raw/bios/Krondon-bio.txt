In today's rap society, many are called but the chosen are few. As an iconoclast against all that ails Hip Hop today, Krondon holds the key. With ten years in the game as a b-boy and producer, this maverick solo artist came together with DJ and producer Truly Odd to record the bombastic underground hit, "The Rules". The Rules marked the birth of one of the left coast's most recognized names and voices that is Krondon. The single enjoyed huge underground success, hearkening to college radio DJs and hip hop fans everywhere. Krondon then came together with DJ Pen One and DJ Khalil to create his next masterpiece single, "Black Gold/Miraculous". The heat of Black Gold's production (DJ Pen One) is met only by the impeccable Krondon flow and lyrical tirade, while Khalil's Miraculous is just that - creating an environment for another Krondon extravaganza. Krondon's harmony with Khalil's beats coupled with his long-time friendship with Self Scientific's Chace Infinite led to their collaboration on Self Scientific's landmark third single "Love Allah". Love Allah is a magnum opus in which Infinite and Krondon showcase back and forth skills to rival those of Run and DMC, Ghostface and Raekwon, and Andr√© 3000 and Big Boi of Outkast. Love Allah has enjoyed huge success, and the Chace Infinite/Krondon combination is so popular that the two MCs have formed an alliance known as The Corsican Brothers.

A new solo album, Let Him Live hosted by DJ Warrior, was set to be released on June 23rd, 2009. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Krondon">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
