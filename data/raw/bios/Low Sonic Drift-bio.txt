Founded in 2007, Low Sonic Drift are a psychedelic minded heavy metal outfit from Glasgow, Scotland. The current line up of the band is Omar Aborida (guitar/vocals), Paul Wilson (bass) and Javaud Habibi (drums). 

Their influences are drawn from sources far and wide; from bands of the desert such as Kyuss and Karma to Burn to the forests of Scandinavia (Opeth, Enslaved) and everywhere in between. As such their music is a vigorous combination of grandiose instrumental passages, chilled psychotropic grooves and monumental thrash style riffage. Combine that with relentless energy and a keen sense of adventure; Low Sonic Drift possess a formidable live show and have shared the stage with such acts as Orange Goblin, Weedeater, Black Sun and Stinking Lizaveta.

Their debut mini-album “Shadows of the Titan” was released by Glasgow based independent record label Theoretical Records in May 2009 and features the tracks ‘Sun Doesn’t Rise’ and ‘Shadows’. 

"Bay Area meets Marrakesh, Low Sonic Drift weave their psychedelic thrash tapestries around complex song structures and top drawer musicianship."

"This mighty trio from Glasgow eschew the frippery and foppery of modern music for something bigger, deeper and darker than most."
