Sleater-Kinney (/ˌsleɪtərˈkɪniː/ SLAY-tər-KIN-ee) is an American rock band that formed in Olympia, Washington, in 1994. The band's current lineup features vocalists/guitarists Corin Tucker and Carrie Brownstein, following the departure of longtime drummer Janet Weiss. Sleater-Kinney came out of the riot grrrl movement, formed from the ashes of the bands Heavens to Betsy and Excuse 17. Today they are recognized as a key part in the American indie rock scene. The band is also known for its feminist and left-leaning political views. They went on hiatus in 2006, working on several other projects, and reunited in 2014.
