There is more than one artist with this name:

1. Defeatist is a New York City, NY-based grindcore band formed from the ashes of technical metal acts Kalibas & Anodyne who play a notably less refined, yet significantly more vital & abrasive brand of grind-punk. Vocalist Aaron Nichols describes the group as "three cranky old dudes who spend their free time playing blast beats in a room that smells like a dead bum's ass." 

Defeatist play raw, angry, socially & politically aware crust-tinged grindcore in the vein of latter-wave grind acts like Discordance Axis, Kill the Client and later-era Insect Warfare. 

At present, the band has released 3 EPs (the Mechanisms of Sanctimonious Filth split w/ Kursk, the In Praise of False Hope EP, and the Thanatonic State EP, all released in 2007), with scheduling & finances prohibiting more prolific recording. In 2009, these splits were collected on 'Sharp Blade Sinks Deep into Dull Minds,' released on Willowtip records. Willowtip went on to release the band's debut full-length, 'Sixth Extinction,' in 2010. 2011 saw the release of a 3-way split with TRIAC and the now-defunct ASRA, and the band is busy preparing their second LP, 'Tyranny of Decay.'
