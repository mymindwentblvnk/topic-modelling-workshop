Cancrena come from south of Italy (Bari). They begin in 2000, and starting from fast and heavy riff guitars they try soon to play their own songs, with influences from great bands as Pantera, Testament and Sepultura. After two years around festvals, contests and various live shows there’s a first change of line-up (new bass player). After this, the band issues its first demo (“Cancrena”, two songs recorded in 2003). 2005 signs, besides a new change of line-up, an heavy live activity and the recordngs of “Fears”, self produced, composed by 7 songs (first demo included). This demo makes the band well known, there are many good reviews in various webzines and Cancrena continue to play live everywhere in south/centre of Italy. During 2006, a new bass player comes in, and the band decides to entrust its visibility with Kick Promotion Agency (Rome). A new Cancrena’s demo “UNDERNEATH” recorded in october 2006 at “Golem Dungeon Studios” with Ottavio Marzo is ready.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cancrena">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
