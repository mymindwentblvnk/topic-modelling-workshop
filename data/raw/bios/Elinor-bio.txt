Eclectic band from Oaxaca, Mexico, with Brit-pop, latin folk, rock and electronic influences. Formed by Alan (lead vocals and guitar), Rame (bass and secondary vocals), Juan (secondary guitar and vocals) and Rafa (drums). Their first album, "The Dreams Inside Mi Cabeza" was released independently in 2003, with the support of the single "Retrovisor", which achieved mild success in Mexican music video channels (mostly in alternative blocks). The video for their second single, "Play-Mobil" proved to be only slightly more successful.

It is said that they have recorded most of the material for their second, still unnamed or dated album, but its release will be delayed until 2007, at least, due to the "geographical separation" of their members. Elinor, however, still proves to be one of the most interesting musical proposals in the Mexican independent music scene (specially in Southern Mexico), if not necessarily recognized as such commercially.

Also ELINOR were obscure Traditional Heavy Metal band from Danmark. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Elinor">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
