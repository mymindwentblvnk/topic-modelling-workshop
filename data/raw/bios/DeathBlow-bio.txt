There are 2 bands by this name:

_______________________________

The first was a technical thrash metal band active in the 80s/90s from Japan. They appeared in "Skull Smash Vol. 1" compilation (1988) with the song "Arms".
They released a full length entitled - "Meanless Propaganda" in 1991. [ Due to poor English of the band it can be estimated that they intended the title to be "Meaningless Propaganda" - but the former title was how the album was pressed. ]

They released a demo in 1994 entitled "Death After 3 Years" with four new songs, after which - ironically, they called it quits.

The second one is DEATHBLOW from U.S.A - "Four seasoned veterans sought to shed their metal roots and to bring something new to the area... heavy music with a positive message. Vocalist Paul Genet (AZAZEL) and drummer Jeremy Stowers (AZAZEL, END OF ALL) recruited bassist Josh Mclaughlin (OUTRUN THE STORM) and guitarist Jon Strickland (A STAINED GLASS ROMANCE) for this innovative project.

DEATHBLOW's aim has been to bring tuned down, no-frills, cause-filled, hard-hitting hardcore to the Tar Heel state. Citing influences such as Earth Crisis, 108, Sepultura, Hatebreed, Harvest, Indecision, and Buried Alive, the band has been relentlessly storming up and down the East Coast.

In 2005, DEATHBLOW caught the attention of upstart label Closed Casket Activities (UNHOLY, RECON, WHEN TIGERS FIGHT) and released their now out-of-print debut EP "Strike Back" to the unsuspecting masses. The group supported this endeavor by headlining a successful tour with Canadian hardcore favorites XIn This DefianceX.

Enter 2007. DEATHBLOW inks a deal with Raleigh, NC based label Tragic Hero Records (ALESANA, A SKYLIT DRIVE, MY HERO IS ME) and releases the full length "Thicker Than Blood." Eleven tracks of devastating, driving hardcore rounded off with a catchy cover, the band has been receiving much praise and recognition, sharing the stage with heavy-hitters such as Hatebreed, Stretch Arm Strong, Terror, Since the Flood, Hoods, The Acacia Strain, Throwdown, Remembering Never, Suffocate Faster, XBishopX, and many more." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Deathblow">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
