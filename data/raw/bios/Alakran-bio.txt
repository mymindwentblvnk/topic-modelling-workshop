A Traditional Metal/Hard Rock band from Buenos Aires, Argentina formed in 1982.

Led by singer Mario Ian, the group recorded its debut album, called Vagabundear, in 1989. Soon after, the Latin rock act had the opportunity to open for Bon Jovi at a Buenos Aires venue. In 1991, Alakrán's second album called Otra Vez En Las Calles was released. After a temporary breakup, the five-piece act reunited in 1997, issuing a self-titled record that same year.
