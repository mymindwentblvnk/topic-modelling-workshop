Stargazery was born late in the year 2005. The force that led to form this band was one single song which Pete wrote. He felt it wasn't suitable for either one of his bands, Burning Point or Ghost Machinery. The song was later named "How Many Miles".

It was clear from the start that the band needed a strong, melodic voice as well as a charismatic frontman. No question about it, Jari Tiura (ex-MSG, Snakegod) was the perfect choice. Bassist Jukka Jokikokko was an easy pick as he was already Pete's bandmate in Burning Point. The drummer at the time was Jarkko Huhtela, Pete's friend and a member from their band way back when... The wizard with the keyboards, Marco Sneck, was found from the ranks of Poisonblack and Kalmah.

Early 2007 Stargazery made its first single "Dying / Rescue" which raised a lot of eyebrows and gained media attention with its melodic metal attack. The band did some selected live performances and decided it was time to start recording their debyt album. They entered the HelGate Studios (Oulu, Finland) to start the studio work. Unfortunately, the activities with MSG and Burning Point delayed the recording process. The drummer also decided to step aside from the band. However, Stargazery was determined to finish the making of their debut album.

The bands line-up was completed again as Jussi Ontero (Burning Point, Ghost Machinery) sat behind the drums. Between 2009 and late 2010 the recording and the mixing of the album were done. After short negotiations Stargazery inked a world wide deal with Germany's Pure Steel Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Stargazery">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
