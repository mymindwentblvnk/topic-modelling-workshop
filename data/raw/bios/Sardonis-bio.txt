SardoniS are a two man aural demolition crew from Belgium whose musical output encompass the pure, unadulterated brutality of High On Fire, the atmosphere of 5ive and the vintage swing n' groove of early Black Sabbath. A throwback to stoney, blown-speaker Doom of that golden Man's Ruin Records era but with a magic all their own.

The band was formed in the summer of 2006.  They've released a 4 song EP on September 1st, 2008 and their debut was released on April 6th, 2010 in courtesy of MeteorCity Records.

SardoniS has shared the stage with bands like Grand Magus, SerpentCult, Kongh, Switchblade, Toner Low, Torche, Pelican, Kylesa, Coalesce, Voivod, Pagan Altar and many more.

Currently the band writes new songs and prepares itself for more live rituals at earbleeding volume.
