Blood Mason is a four-piece metal band with members from the Barossa Valley and the eastern suburbs of Adelaide. With influences such as Iron Maiden, Sepultura, Black Sabbath, Slayer, Cannibal Corpse, Death, Pantera, and Cradle of Filth, Blood Mason play a fast and furious technical brand of metal that never loses the focus of producing great sounding tunes while still keeping the intensity and power of the true old-school metal genre. Pride is taken in creating epic songs that are not only savagely brutal in their delivery but are also melodically harmonious in construction. Blood Mason formed in the summer of 2003/04 when the three remaining members of local metal act Menace were joined by Brendan on guitar (Ex. Sarsekim). There have been no line-up changes since and Blood Mason has continued to get tighter and tighter while gigging around Adelaide at various venues. In April of 2005 Blood Mason produced and recorded their self-titled 3-track debut EP that has been selling well at gigs since and is currently available at several record outlets in South Australia. The band has progressed much in skill since its inception and far from stagnating has had a constantly evolving style, steadily producing new material and developing a unique sound that is Blood Mason's own. Blood Mason is a band that loves playing live and never turns down an opportunity to get loud on stage and entertain some fans. With an ever growing fan base, Blood Mason look forward to playing a lot more live shows throughout 2008. Tracking has been finished for the debut album and release is planned for May 2008 <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Blood+Mason">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
