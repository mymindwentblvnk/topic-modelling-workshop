Old school Death Metal band from the UK formed in 2005.
Formed by Danny Price & Tommy Atkins around 2005, Decrepid started as 2 guitarist playing Slayer and Death covers with a few original songs too. Friends Mike Dummett and Lewis Philips joined on Drums and Bass but after a year or so of line up changes and no luck finding a vocalist, everyone went their separate way. 

 Danny joined Necrosadistic Goat Torture for a couple of years while Tommy went into rock and roll forming a new band called 'Cold Shoulder', Mike played in a few bands including Brutai and Lewis went down the pub.

 In mid 2008 Danny left NGT and reformed Decrepid with original Drummer Mike, Later Cris Bassan and Marnie from Repugnant Inebriation joined on Vocals & Bass. 

 Decrepid played their first gig opening for Nunslaughter in March 2009.

 Steve Brennen aka GoatCommando only played in the Band as a session Guitarist for 3 Gigs and recorded all Lead Guitars on the 2009 Demo. This was due to Stevie Curriers unexpected departure.
