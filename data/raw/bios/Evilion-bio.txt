Evilion was a Gothic/Symphonic metal band from Helsinki, Finland formed in 2004 and split up in 2007, which featured two female vocalists, one singing aggressively and the other performing classical soprano vocals. Three members of the group (Jani, Janne and Anna) were previous members of Silentium.

Their debut album "Vanity" was released in 2006. The album was released via the band's website, where fans could download it for free.

In 2007, the vocalists Angela and Anna both left the band, Angela because she was no longer interested in metal, and Anna to study with the famous singer Joanna Borowska in Austria (although Anna was technically on hiatus). A soprano singer named Jaana was introduced, but the band announced that "We have a single live show before Anna leaves and we haven't yet decided how we want to deal with live gigs while Anna isn't available. New material is in the works and we will be releasing it one song at the time to cut the wait a bit shorter and to make it possible for us to work while Anna is abroad for most of the year." 

No new material has been released, and the band's website is now defunct, so it can safely be presumed that the band has broken up.
