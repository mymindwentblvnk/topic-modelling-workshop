Utopian Dream are a german progressive/melodic metal band, consisting out of 4 members, aged 19-23 years:
- Benjamin Fetscher (Vocals, Keyboards)
- Chris Erhart (E-Guitar, Vocals)
- Philipp Schuehle (Drums, Bass)
- Timo Mertens (E-Guitar)

The beginning of Utopian Dream was in 2003, when Chris Erhart, Dominik Seidel and Philipp Schuehle played together for fun. They improvised a lot, but then their first songs, The Dreamer and Carried Away were written.
Soon they found out, that they needed another bandmember, either a keyboarder or a guitarist. Their choice was Timo Mertens, and as soon as he was a bandmember, Utopian Dream decided to record The Dreamer and Carried Away.
Benjamin Fetscher recorded their songs, but in the same session, he joined the band, and so they had two guitars and a keyboard. With new possibilities, they wrote new songs. With new potential and a wider range of instruments, they wrote new songs and decided to name their band Utopian Dream.
In June 2006 their second demo cd was recorded, and they provide a free sample:
Metal Sludge (22:53 mins, 36.2 MB).

The aim of Utopian Dream is to play ambitious music with a high level. They do not want to be just another Heavy Metal Band, they want to play something new. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Utopian+Dream">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
