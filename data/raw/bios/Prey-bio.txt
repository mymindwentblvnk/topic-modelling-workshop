1) Prey is a gothic rock/metal band from Groningen, The Netherlands.

Prey arose from the ashes of Immortalized in 1999. The band released their first promo "Fly to…" in the second half of 2001. It was recorded in one take, home-produced, and burned onto CD-ROM. The response to these 18 minutes of blood, sweat and tears was tremendous. "Fly to…" sold out in a matter of months. It was never re-released, because Prey has been through several line-up changes since then, and these recordings no longer represent what Prey stands for now. 

Prey has developed a very diverse repertoire, inspired by the widely differing tastes of individual band members. Prey’s songs are always very melodic, and usually tend towards the melancholy. The band makes it a priority to make Heartfelt Music; the lyrics tend to be reflections on real experiences and emotions, and the music itself breathes life into those beautifully sung lyrics. 

The band has had the honour to grace the stage alongside great metal bands such as: Anathema, Epica, Autumn, Sengir, The Wounded and Morning.

In 2004 the band released the album "Heartfelt".

Line-up:

Roeland van der Velde – Lead Vocals
Mariët Gast – Synths
Jurgen Oldenburger – Guitars
Klaas van der Meulen – Guitars
Bouke van Haasteren – Bass
Matthijs Oosterhof – Drums, Percussion
