Having risen from the ashes of the highly underrated November Coming Fire, Tortuga offer a violent & moody landslide of fast-paced, aggressive post-hardcore, noise and doom. 

Taking influences from bands such as Breather Resist, Black Sabbath & Queens Of The Stone Age, Tortuga have a feast of riff-tastically heavy and chaotic doom-laden songs for even the most cynical listener to sink their teeth into. 

Hailing from the grim Norfolk city of Norwich, for the past year Tortuga have been destroying venues around the UK with their sonic assault of epic proportions, leaving nothing but a trail of half-deafened punters grinning from ear-to-ear & begging for more. 

After quickly recording a two-track demo ‘The Cold’, Tortuga started work with In At The Deep End & Lol Eaves to record and release their debut album ‘Kings Of Albany’. 

Founding members John Richards (guitar) & Greg Gittins (bass) are joined by new drummer John Simmons (previously of the mighty xCanaanx) and second guitarist Alex Hamilton (one of the original members of now defunct stoner kings Bossk). 

With his seething & poetically honest lyrics, vocalist Gareth Evans fronts this troupe of miserablists. 

Tortuga are now ready to show the UK what real heavy music sounds like. 

'KINGS OF ALBANY' is out November 10, 2008
