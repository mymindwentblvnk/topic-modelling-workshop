Demontcea Howard, better known by his stage name Unusual Demont, was born January, 19th of 2000 in Madison, Wisconsin. His Mother died when he was 4 and he was raised by his Father and Grandparents. 2013 he became friends with a boy named Keiwon Caldwell (AlmightyK) and another named Gavino Gatica (Gavin-O), these three would come to be known as the music collective, Unusual. They planned to release a mixtape called "Turtles" but it never got recorded. Gavin-O eventually faded from the group and AlmightyK didn't want to make music anymore. Demontcea, at this point rapping under the name Demont, however, continued to make music. He still enjoyed the name of the now-broken-up group and so he took it and is now known as Unusual Demont.
