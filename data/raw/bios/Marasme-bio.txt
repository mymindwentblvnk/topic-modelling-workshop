Are a sludge/progressive metal band from Balears, Spain.

Marasme

1-Extremely slimness or weakening of human body.

2-Moral or phisical hanging, motionless.

Something atmospheric. Something chaotic, obsessive, melancholic. Claustrophobic and free: something dark, complex, painful. Marasme was born in January of 2008 when five twisted minds joined together to make something different: Jeroni (vocals; ex-Strangled), Tomeu (guitar; TeCorrs, ex-Venus Inferna), Manuel (guitar; ex-Stones From The Sky), Jaume (bass; ex-Dogma) and David (drums; ex-Dogma).
