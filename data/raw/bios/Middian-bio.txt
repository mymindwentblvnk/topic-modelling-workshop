Middian was a doom metal / sludge band formed in 2005 in Portland, Oregon, United States. The band comprised guitarist Mike Scheidt (YOB), bass guitarist / vocalist Will Lindsay and drummer Scott Headrick. They released one album, titled Age Eternal. Guitarist Mike Scheidt formed Middian after his previous band, YOB, disbanded in 2006. The group's debut album, Age Eternal, was released on Metal Blade Records in 2007. Middian toured throughout the United States in support of this album.

In October 2007, the band received a "cease and desist order" from a Wisconsin-based group "Midian" demanding that Middian stop using their name completely. Included were orders to cease all sales and existence of physical recordings by Middian. In August 2008, Middian officially split up. The band stated that their lawsuit was coming to a close, but it had come with a high cost to the band, personally and interpersonally. Also, Mike Scheidt felt like he needed to back off from touring due to family and work issues. As a result of this disbanding, Mike Scheidt also announced that his previous band, YOB, would be reforming.

Currently Mike Scheidt is related with YOB. Will Lindsay spent a short time in Wolves in the Throne Room, and is now in Indian and Nachtmystium.
