Dragonland is an Epic Symphonic Metal band from Gothenburg, Sweden. The group is most notable for basing their two first albums upon the self-produced The Dragonland Chronicles fantasy saga and for the original symphonic/electronic parts by Elias Holmlid. Nightrage's Marios Iliopoulos and Jimmie Strimell have provided guest appearances on their latest album, Astronomy.

Their release "Starfall" was produced by Tom S. Englund (Vocalist of Evergrey), doing some vocal parts himself.

Since "Starfall" they have changed their sound from being a heavier power metal band to being a more melodic, slightly progressive power metal band. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dragonland">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
