Voluptas are a Prague-based experimental black metal band, influenced by the Norwegian avant-garde of the 1990s and other eccentric rock genres. Their music occasionally incorporates various elements of psychedelia, (free) jazz and noise, and their studio records, as well as live shows, often feature a guest saxophonist.
