Dallas Tx based band Burying The Trend has one of the meanest in the area. From getting away with YEARS of underage drinking at local clubs by paying off the owners to calling out non listeners from the stage and embarrassing them in front of their peers, in the words of Frontman and co founder Andrew Hulshult "We really just dont give a fuck and we wont have a problem with you as long as you have a lighter and you dont spill our fucking drinks". Since 2004 the band has been writing / recording / playing together, always looking for a new fan to pick up the tab. If you are ever In Dallas Tx, do yourself a favor, look them up and dont miss the live show. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Burying+The+Trend">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
