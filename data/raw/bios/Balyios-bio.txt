Established in 2010, Balyios portrays an image of melodic folk metal that's sure to awaken your inner Viking and soothe the noble savage inside of you. What started out as nothing more than a casual project between two mates has turned into a full fledged musical onslaught, finding musical and lyrical inspiration from ancient Norse mythology and lore. 

Since its birth, the band has released a four-track EP and played with various local artists including AGRO, All of Eternity, Erebus and Bile of Man. Balyios is a mixture of melodic, folk and symphonic heavy metal, beautifully crafted to create a truely unique sound and atmosphere.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Balyios">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
