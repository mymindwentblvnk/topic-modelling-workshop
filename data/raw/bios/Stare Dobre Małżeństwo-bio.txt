There are two artists called SDM : the first one is Stare Dobre Małżeństwo , a Polish group, which performs in a style of music called "sung poetry" which can be described as mix of mostly acoustic, melodic folk music and poetic lyrics. Almost all of their songs were composed by the lead singer, Krzysztof Myszkowski and use poems by Polish poets Edward Stachura, Adam Ziemianin or Jan Rybowicz as lyrics. Sung poetry is strongly related to folk music and uses mostly acoustic guitars, violin and vocal harmonies to create instantly melodic musical landscape. Many of the group's compositions became evergreens and are very much present in Polish culture despite lack of mainstream promotion.

The second one is SDM, a French rapper. He made his debut in rap at the age of 15 years as Sadam. He then did clips in amateur before signing on the label 432 inc in 2019. SDM adopts a rap “street”, raw, dark, through many tracks but he also knows how to open up and offer more melodious tracks. A few months later, the rapper Booba noticed him and shared him on his Instagram. Booba decides to meet the artist from Clamart, then makes him sign on his label 92i records in February 2020. On April 9, 2021, his first album, Ocho, was released, consisting of 18 tracks, with guest appearances from Booba, Bramsito, Fally Ipupa, PLK and Koba LaD. The album is very eclectic musically. It is positioned at the second place of the best album sales in France from its first week of release according to the official ranking of the SNEP, with 7,884 sales. He then released a deluxe version of this album on December 10, 2021. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Stare+Dobre+Ma%C5%82%C5%BCe%C5%84stwo">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
