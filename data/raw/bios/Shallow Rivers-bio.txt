Shallow Rivers were formed on a gloomy November day in 2007 when two former members of ruined Vezha (Tower) Yury and Sergey spread their sails towards new lands. Flowing through the mist and driven by the wind Shallow Rivers with new recruits Dmitry (vocals, bass) and Lin (vocals) released their debut demo Water Awakes in April 2009. The release was followed by gigs with local underground doom metal bands and supported by new members Max (drums) and Margarita (guitars). During 2010-2012 the band worked over the first fulllength album challenging different line up changes. Finally, in June 2013 Yury together with Vladimir (My Indifference to Silence, also former member of Revelations of Rain) finished the record of the long waited album at MyRealm Studio. The album Nihil Euphoria was released worldwide through BadMoodMan Music in October 2013 and was well received in Russia and abroad. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Shallow+Rivers">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
