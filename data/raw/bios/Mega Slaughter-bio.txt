Mega Slaughter is an old school death metal band from Sweden. They formed in 1986 and was known as Disloyd until changing their name just before their first demo. The band plays traditional death metal mixing in thrash, hardcore and other elements into their sound. Often called the 'Gothenburg' sound the Swedish hardliners used melodic riffs, fast drumming and rough vocals within their experimental solos and song structures. The band is often associated with Hetsheads  and Darkified for similar sounds.

After their name change, the band, self-released their first demo Death Remains in 1990 which got them an underground following and were picked up by French label Thrash Records. This made their debut album release Calls From the Beyond in 1991 which created a powerful and atmospheric tone on the death metal scene. 

However, the band, had internal conflicts about the directions making Benny Öst (Guitars) and Fredrik Matsson (Vocals) leave the band. The replacements Jens Johansson (Vocals, Cabal (Swe)) and Emil Ilic (Guitars, Jaggernaut, Concrete Mass) to make the band complete again. They toured around Sweden and released one more demo in 1991 before breaking up for good due to musical differences.

After the band split up, the band were in other projects including former bass player Alex Räfling and guitarist Emil Ilic in JAGGERNAUT. Also with Patrick "Putte" Räfling drumming in other bands like Hammerfall and Heed. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mega+Slaughter">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
