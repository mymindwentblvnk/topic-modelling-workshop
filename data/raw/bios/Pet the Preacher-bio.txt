Pet The Preacher is a danish hard rock band, formed in 2010, that consists of Christian Hede Madsen (vocals, guitar), Torben WÃ¦ver Pedersen (bass) and Christian Von Larsen (drums). 

With a great love for 70's blues-rock and old slide masters such as Elmore James and Bukka White, Pet The Preacher mixes history with the modern. Metal structures, prog-inspired, shout-vocals and eerie tales. A trio who play for their lives every time. And without compromise. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pet+the+Preacher">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
