Xenobia started out back in 2000 as an instrumental trio. After five years of playing only instrumental stuff the band came in contact with singer Rodney Blaze, who people may know of his contribution to the re-issue album "The Final Experiment - Special Edition" by Ayreon.

You might also know drummer Koen Herfst for his work as sessiondrummer for Epica and After Forever.

The EP ‘Burn it away’ is the first release of the new Xenobia. It contains five songs and features a guest appearance by Joost van den Broek (After Forever, Ayreon).
