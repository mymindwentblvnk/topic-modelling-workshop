Der Galgen (meaning 'Gallows' in German) is a folk metal band originating from Saint-Petersburg, Russia. Forming in October 2006, the band didn't appear on stage until the beginning of 2008. It was then that they started to gain popularity - not only in Saint-Petersburg, but Moscow as well. So far, they have released an EP, and two full length albums.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Der+Galgen">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
