In the second instrumental more resources were used to get a more pro sound.

The first album with complete band adding voices was released in the second half of 2007 under the name of "Into The Light", this is the first "album" of the band... 

Nova Prospekt is a local non-commercial and underground (or garage) band with no intentions to become a known group. No serious busisnes, just a hobby matter. Playing only in known social events in the zone. And recording music independently just for self-satisfaction and earn more experience... this just for the moment, who knows in the future... <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nova+Prospekt">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
