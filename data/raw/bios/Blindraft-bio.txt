Blindraft is a new modern heavy-metal French band.
The six young musicians of this crew offer loud riffs for hungry headbangers, loads of melodies well performed by the young singer, orchestrated by struggles between keyboard and guitars.

Let this boiling for three months and you get " Doomsday".
The first four tracks E.P in Blindraft's discography.

For this first experience, after a Blindraft's show, Mr Xort (Anorexia Nervosa's keyboard) proposed them to record in his own studio (The Drudenhaus Studio).

So far, Blindraft has sold 400 "Doomsday" and is known even by some of the other side of the Atlantic (US radio, festival proposals).
Blindraft is heading for a label that would give them the opportunity to enter into the metal universe. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/blindraft">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
