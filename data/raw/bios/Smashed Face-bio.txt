SMASHED FACE is a band from Highland, Czech Republic, Europe. They started as thrash / old school death metal on their demo "Invaze" (2002), evolving to pure DM on their debut album "Human: Earth Parasite" (2004), then progressed to brutal death metal mixed with hard core on their sophomore recording "Virulent Procreation" (2006) and Split 7" EP with Cutterred Flesh released in 2009. Now the style of the band can be called new school death metal / deathcore. After many delays during the post-production of their third record the album titled MisAnthropoCentric is out now (January 2011).
