Little known, yet competent Toronto Thrash band Angel Beast churned out two or three independent releases, including the 1990 'In The Meantime' three track EP on Metal Rage Records, and even managed to produce a low budget video.

There was never a permanent singer but Tim and Jamie came close

The band still plays from time to time but only in private.

Angel Beast was part of Raw M.E.A.T. compilation (1990/M.E.A.T. Communications Inc.) with song It's Insane. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Angel+Beast">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
