Epitaphium is a two-piece Hungarian black metal band formed in 2003 on a cold winter's night. The members of the band are Ákos Fazekas (guitars, vocals, songwriting) and Tamás Berki (bass, battery, lyrics). They play melodic, yet strong and aggressive black metal. Their lyrics are mainly about the night, the nature, the ancient times and the evil in man. 
So far they released two demos, these are "Shadows Pass" and "Under Time". They are currently working on their first full-length material, which will be called "Beyond Reality".
