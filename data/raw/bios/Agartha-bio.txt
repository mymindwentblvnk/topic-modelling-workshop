Agartha is the soundscape composition project founded by musicians Max Alper and Miles Coe. Their first EP, 'Truro', was released to the public in August, 2007. It can be found for free download on Agartha's Website. Their music usually consists of symphonic melodies played through guitars and voice, various effects meant to take the listener somewhere else, and chaotic climatic finishes filled with dissonance, primal screams, and noise textures.
