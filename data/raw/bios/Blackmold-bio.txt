Blackmold was formed in 2009 when Dylan and Danny met while traveling, hitchhiking and riding freight trains around the country. While staying at a moldy punk house in Oklahoma City, they wrote a handful of songs on borrowed instruments to play a show before they went separate ways. They reunited in 2010 in Seattle, WA to record the songs they'd written (again on borrowed equipment) and continue the band. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/blackmold">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
