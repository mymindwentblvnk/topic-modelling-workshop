Thyateira is not only a metal band but an idea. An idea that not all is lost in heavy metal music. The young motivated 5 piece are on a  mission to restore the basic fundamentals of Metal.
Formed in the summer of 2007, the young group made a pact that this band, Thyateira, would stop at nothing until their music was heard. Now three and a half years later, Thyateira have released a full length album “Beholder,” have played the greater midwest area, been in rotation on 500 radio markets, and have only just begun.
Now the year is 2010 and Thyateira is prepared to dive head first into the music industry, with the very recent release of their 2010 EP “Purpose” the world will soon see what is to come from the power house that is THYATEIRA. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Thyateira">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
