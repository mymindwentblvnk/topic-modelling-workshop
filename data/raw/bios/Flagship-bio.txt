There are multiple acts under the moniker "Flagship"

1) Flagship is a band from Charlotte, NC. The band is made up of Drake Margolnick (vocals, guitar) Matthew Padgett (guitar, bgv) Michael Finster (drums, programming) Grant Harding (keys) and Chris Comfort (bass). They have one EP titled "Blackbush" that was released in 2012, and released their first full-length album self-titled "Flagship" on October 8, 2013. http://flagshipmusic.com

2) FLAGSHIP are quite the odd project. Formed in 2002 by keyboardist Linus Kåse and vocalist Christian Rivel, both of NARNIA fame, they wasted little time collecting a stable lineup and fleshing out their sound, consisting of “symphonic rock in the vein of KANSAS, STYX, BUGGLES & QUEEN.” These influences certainly show (perhaps most particularly QUEEN of the bunch) but at the same time FLAGSHIP has little trouble crafting their own unique quality which separates them from their predecessors. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Flagship">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
