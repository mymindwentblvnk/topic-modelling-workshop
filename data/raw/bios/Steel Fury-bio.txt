Steel Fury is a Speed/Thrash Metal band from Montgomery, Alabama. Steel Fury play primarily a thrash style with other influences like traditional speed metal and traditional power metal. Almost like Pikachu when he has all those powerful attacks like thunderbolt and thundershock being the thrash influences but still having the traditional metal attacks like tackle and takedown, but are less prominent and less used. The guitar tone, noted right off the bat from the opener Justice Day is like Electrobuzz, with the razor buzzsaw tone and straight up electric riffing insanity.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Steel+Fury">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
