Kings Of The Killing Field is composed of previous members of the Crash Music Recording Artists "Spinecast", working together once again on a new sick project dedicated to the United States Armed Forces. The formation consists of King Kron - Shred/Screams, Cameron Pinkerton - Low End, Lance Wright - Battery/Engineering. We have recorded 11 face smashing songs and have released a CD that will leave a permanent mark in metal!!!! The use of 8-string guitars and stellar line-up promise this to be a force to behold. Keep in touch! We will be posting updates periodically to keep everyone informed as to what is going on. Thanks for the add and stay fucking sick!!!!!
