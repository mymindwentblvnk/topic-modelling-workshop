The Mechanix began as a would-be band started by freshmen guitarists Scott Barber and Tanner Roof. They knew they needed a drummer, and quickly found out one of their friends was a drummer, Alex Henderson. This would-be band lasted much of 1st semester of 06-07 school year. Alex could not practice so Scott and Tanner knew they needed to find another drummer. In April of '07, Scott finally had a "band practice" with Scott and Tanner on guitar and Alex on drums. At the time, the band was called "Bill and the Cosbys." The get-together was a complete failure, Alex could barely drum and Scott and Tanner had trouble following him. Later that evening, Scott and Tanner pulled some pranks on Alex, producing "The Chronicles of Alex" videos on YouTube. Alex was extremely angered with Scott and Tanner and when Scott and Tanner were about to fire him, Alex quit. This left problems. Scott and Tanner needed a drummer but also a bass player and vocalist. Through another friend, Scott met Alec Edelson, a sophomore that played guitar and sang. Alec quickly joined the band, which was renamed "Latem Daeh." Tanner left because there was no need for 3 guitarists. Scott and Alec soon changed the band's name again to "The Mechanix." Tanner was quickly rerecruited for fill-in bass duties. The band still does not have a drummer, but for demo recordings either Scott will drum or they will use a computer drummer. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Mechanix">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
