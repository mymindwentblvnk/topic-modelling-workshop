Since the very beginning of ages there was a sound. Silent flow of water, rustle of ancient woods, whistle of mighty winds over the treetops, hum of sleeping mountains and even whisper of stones… Every slightest sound together with the others created a unique harmony of all living things. 
And only one creature on Earth caused dissonance for this eternal orchestra, trying to ruin the music and play it in own way. One by one, human was destroying the sounds with it’s noise, until finally all around went quiet, gathering strength.
The retribution is close - it has lurked in the depths and awaits the onset of darkness. The sound is coming back. But this symphony is not going to sound so peaceful anymore...

In 2009 musicians from various bands gathered in one collective and named it Agruss. The range of styles they all played before, was very wide - from black metal, death to crust and post metal. So, as a unity rod band chose not the music, canons of which are ignored by Agruss, but the idea and emotions.
All members of the band have grown on the lands that symbolically reflect the reality of our days - ancient forests, swamps and rivers are surrounded by three nuclear power plants, one of which exploded in 1986, leaving a rotting scar on the face of all planet.
Devastated villages, chased animals, mutilated temple of nature, which dozed peacefully for thousands of years, wandering shadows against the starry sky — there is no place to escape from this, except inside. Nature is inside us, we are inside of the nature.
The debut album Morok is a scream — as an evidence of frustration, as a result of this hopeless escape.
