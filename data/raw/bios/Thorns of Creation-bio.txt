Thorns Of Creation is a melodic death metal group with it’s origins in the Central Oregon music scene. Since their debut performance on May 5th of 2007, they have established themselves as one of the leading acts in the area. Undeniably heavy yet incredibly catchy, ToC’s music blends rich melodies with intense aggression that comes together in a style which appeals to an audience ranging from dedicated metal fans to casual music listeners. This combined with their impressive, energetic live show sets Thorns Of Creation apart as a group to follow.

In the two years since it’s inception, the members of ToC (vocalist Brandon Burton, guitarists Johnny Burroughs & Matt Hallman, bassist Garrett Judkins and percussionist Anthony Wyke) have driven themselves to grow musically and professionally, constantly rasing the bar as individuals and as a group. This is evident in every live performance, every song and every new step in Thorns Of Creation’s career. This includes the recording of their debut full-length album “Twilight Descends”.
