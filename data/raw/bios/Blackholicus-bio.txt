Blackholicus started in 2001 as a power trio and evolved into a full-on four-piece thrash rock band, dual leads blazing, in 2004. 

With femme-punk vocals, sci-fi and fantasy themes, virtuosic bass and immaculate guitar leads, the four have unleashed a classic metal firestorm for the first half of the new millennium and have sworn an oath to rock until they die. 

Their debut album, "Variations in Death Minor," earned rave reviews in several Austin publications. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Blackholicus">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
