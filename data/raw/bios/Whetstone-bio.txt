There are several artists with the name Whetstone:

1. Traditional Heavy Metal from Germany. Formed in 1984. They released two Demos, 'Blood United' on 1986 and 'Ancient Metal' on 1988.

2. A progressive melodic death metal band from London, England. Dario Ferrari; vocals and guitars, Billy Padmore; guitars, Matt Inman; bass and composition, Dimitri Shaw; drums.  Drawing inspiration from the likes of Opeth, Edge of Sanity, Death, Garden of Shadows among others, Whetstone has a forward thinking sound that combines the best of these bands while still sounding unique and fresh. With melodic guitar lines ranging from beautiful to sinister harmonies, and harsh vocals that capture the raw emotion and intensity of the music.  The band self-released "Hunted", their first EP, in August 2011 with the members not yet aged 18 to good reception. The band gigged actively around London wherever possible following this release.  Over the next few years, they earned a great deal of experience, and refined their sound.  This culminated in getting to the final of Band Quest 2012, playing at the Camden Underworld.  Writing and recording new material over 2013, Whetstone finally released their highly anticipated next EP "Unearthed Knowledge" in January of 2014 to fantastic reception.  Promotion of the release is ongoing, and Whetstone are looking to work towards their first full release in the near future. Unearthed Knowledge can be streamed and downloaded for free at www.whetstoneuk.bandcamp.com Be sure to 'like' Whetstone at their Facebook page for updates! http://www.facebook.com/WhetstoneUK
