Dagoba is an industrial metal/groove metal band from Marseille, France that formed in 2000. Influenced by styles such as  those of Machine Head, Strapping Young Lad, Pantera and Fear Factory they managed to create a solid, brutal sound of their own.

Given that, in France, metal music is not as popular as in other countries, Dagoba often plays concerts and gigs outside France, such as in Germany and the Scandinavian countries, with support slots with such big metal names as Machine Head, In Flames and Sepultura.

Franky Costanza (former Imperial drummer) and Izakar also play in a side-project named Blazing War Machine. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dagoba">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
