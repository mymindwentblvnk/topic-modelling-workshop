Ringar is a one-man Black Metal / Ambient project from the US, formed in 2004. Lyrical styles include Insanity, Suicide, & Abstract Depressive Themes.

A Creation Led By Esoterica, (Chaos Moon, ManeThereN, Coffin (US), In Ruins (US), Heimnar, Troglodytic) Ringar was created after the death of Troglodytic. 

For the moment, Ringar is on hiatus, due to Esoterica's current involvement with Chaos Moon, as well as vocal parts for ManeThereN. As far as future of Ringar is concerned, it has not been abandoned, rather it will be used as mainly an ambient project.

Many of Chaos Moon's riffs/structures were derived directly from Ringar, which is one reason why these 2 projects will forever be linked with each other. Early versions of Ringar tracks and demos later became what is now known as Chaos Moon. They can be found on full-length releases 'Origin Of Apparition', and 'Languor Into Echoes, Beyond'. In early 2007, RingarÃ«, Farewell was set to be released, but was never finished. It was supposed to be the final album from Ringar, but that remains to be seen... <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ringar">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
