Eugene McGuinness (born 1985 in London, England) is a singer/songwriter signed to Domino Records.

After The Early Learnings Of - a mini album of 8 songs - was released to great critical acclaim last year on Domino’s Publishing Label Double Six, Eugene headed to the studio to make his first full album proper for Domino. The result is twelve utterly charming pop tracks, which skip between boundaries with gleeful abandon and an acidic sense of humour.

Eugene McGuinness’ album contains knowing winks and phrases drawn from personal experience, but mostly made up scenarios full of joyous verve and unpredictability. It is a collection of songs gloriously out of time yet thoroughly modern, with one foot in reality and the other somewhere else entirely,.
