There are various groups with the name Gauche:

1) Birthed from Washington D.C.’s punk scene like a manifestation of righteous rage, Gauche—which counts as members Priests’ Daniele Yandel, Downtown Boys’ Mary Jane Regalado, and Jason P. Barnett—emerged first in 2015.

2) Gauche are one of Sydney's most inspiring groups. Their quest for new sounds is matched by their mastery in their respective crafts - the band comprises musicians from such renowned acts as Hermitude, Monsieur Camembert, Tooth, Circus Bizarre, Circus Monoxide, Darth Vegas, and classical vocal ensemble Cantillation. The diversity combined with the talent and perfectionism in Gauche has created a unique new sound in Australian music.

Gauche delight in contorting traditional song structure and drawing on innumerable musical reference points, though always with an underlying electronic, or electro-acoustic sound. The musicians' roles are not always typical, rather their interaction could be described as a fragile sculpture of fragments that interlock like jigsaw pieces. And these intricate sounds are pulled off seamlessly live.

Through their penchant for designing and building their own instruments and a passion for creating a sound world without bounds, Gauche are defiantly breaking new ground both locally and internationally.

Except they broke up in July 2007. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gauche">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
