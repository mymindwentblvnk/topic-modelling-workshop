Getting weak from the limitless wish to embody thyself, their world-perception explodes with ideas to get out from the underground a band that values the style of Death Metal. INHERENT SCREAM begins to form in May 2006 upon the initiative of Lyuba (vocals). The huge desire to combine a strong unit of musicians with the same aim and attitude plus having skills from playing in other projects became reality. In the process of formation the band changes a few guitarists and bass players. The first live appearance of the band happens August 19, 2007 at a biker festival "Free Rock Fest" in Bryanka.
