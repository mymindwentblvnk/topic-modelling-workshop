Anoraak is the musical project of French musician Frédéric Rivière, multi instrumentalist, singer, producer and DJ, former drummer of Pony Pony Run Run. and member of the Valerie Collective along with artists such as College, Maethelvin, The Outrunners, Minitel Rose and Russ Chimes. Coming from the rock scene at first, he later came to electronic music, starting Anoraak beside his drummer position.

His music is related to the retro-synth and 80's inspired scenes recently highlighted by the movie Drive's soundtrack. His sound is described as "dreamy synth-filled tracks that fall somewhere on the spectrum between disco and new wave", "contemporary but retro-tinged" or "easy, breezy [...] chugging along on airy synthesizers like a weekend train to the beachside town of Nantes". Now his music is considered as "70s inspired disco [...]. Borrowing influences from pop, disco, house, and indie".

Anoraak has collaborated with artists such as the former Swedish Italo Disco outfit Sally Shapiro, American singer Slow Shiver, French producer College, Danish singer Lydmor, and has also remixed numerous artists such as Neon Indian, Mika, Junkie XL, Wild Belle, Julian Perretta, among others. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Anoraak">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
