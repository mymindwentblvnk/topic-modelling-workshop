Necromantia was created in late 1989 by two like minded individuals: The Magus (bass/vocals) and Baron Blood (8-string bass). Their aim was to create original, powerful and innovative Diabolical music, replacing the usual 6-string guitars with 8-string bass! Their first recordings earned them a cult status in the scene since they were very original, ritualistic and utterly sinister! Necromantia never hesitated to use "non-metal" instruments like: saxophone, percussions, etc in addition to their standard metal orchestrations. And that option made them unique and established their own sound.
