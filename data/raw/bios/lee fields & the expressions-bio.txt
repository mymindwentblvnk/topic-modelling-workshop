Lee Fields & The Expressions is a USA soul band, which released My World (2009). 'The Expressions' began with the encouragement of Jeff Silverman & Leon Michels, in 2004. Upon foundation of Truth & Soul Records they called Lee in, to record the single that became Do You Love Me (Like You Say You Do) / Honey Dove - the result was so promising, the band was born.

Fast forward almost two years & The Expressions (feat' Lee Fields), have successfully created a unique and personal sound that can hold court with the bands they set out to emulate.  However, what was created in the process goes beyond just a carbon copy of a sweet soul music.  The music has developed into a deeply soulful mix of old and new.  The formula stayed the same but the style has been adapted for the ears of people who didnâ€™t grow up on Al Green or Sam Cooke.  Elements of modern music have crept their way into the mix to create something entirely fresh and unique.  The Expressions have surely lived up to the name, each song they make is choked full of raw emotion that permeates deep through your ear hole straight to the soul. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lee+Fields+&+The+Expressions">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
