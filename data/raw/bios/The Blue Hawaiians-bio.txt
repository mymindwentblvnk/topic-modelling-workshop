The Blue Hawaiians are a surf-rock group from Los Angeles. They formed in 1994 to play at the opening of their friend Michelle's club, The Lava Lounge. They rose to fame soon thereafter due to the rise of one of their earliest fans, Quentin Tarantino, and an appearance on the soundtrack of the hit TV show Friends. The group have since released several albums which have generally fared well with critics. The band also does music for the hit cartoon series "SpongeBob SquarePants". Current band members include: Mark Fontana, Erik Godal, Mark Sproull, Tomas Maxwell, Gary Brandin.
