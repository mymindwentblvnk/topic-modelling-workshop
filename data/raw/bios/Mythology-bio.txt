2) Mythology were an English blues band based in Carlisle in the late 1966, with Neil Marshall bass; Mike Gillan vocals; Frank Kenyon lead guitar and Terry Sims drums. From January 1968 they featured a lead guitarist called Tony Iommi (who took over from Frank Kenyon (born 12 October 1945, in Carlisle, Cumberland died 20??) and brought his friend Chris Smith along as well, who had both been in The Rest. From mid February 1968 a drummer called Bill Ward (who with Iommi later formed Black Sabbath in August 1969), Neil Marshall (born Neil Marshall Smith, in 1944, in Carlisle) and Chris Smith (vocals, born Christopher Neil Smith, in 1949, in Erdington, Birmingham, Warwickshire). Tony and Bill were from Birmingham and had previously been in a band called "The Rest" that had decided to move from Birmingham up to Carlisle.

3) Ward's first gig with the band was on Saturday 17 February 1968, at the Globe Hotel, in Main Street, Cockermouth, Cumberland. Mythology also played on 30 April 1968 at the 101 Club, in Carlisle and on 4 May 1968, at the Clockwork Orange, Chester, Cheshire, supporting The Rain.

4) Mythology were a blues/rock band that had some success in the area but eventually disbanded after an incident where all four members were fined 15 pounds for possession of cannabis resin in Carlisle on May 27, 1968. Since this was considered to be a serious offense at the time, much of their gigging work dried up, and they disbanded after the final show at the Queen's Hotel, in Silloth, July 13, 1968.

After the dissolution the two of band members, Bill Ward and Tonny Iommi with other two musicians, Ozzy Osbourne and Geezer Butler founded a new band, Polka Tulk, later called Earth and finally renamed to Black Sabbath. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mythology">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
