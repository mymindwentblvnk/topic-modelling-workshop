Inspired by songstresses like Etta James, Amy Winehouse and Adele, Raquel Rodriguez has distinguished herself as a rising star in the competitive Los Angeles jazz scene. An alumnus of L.A.’s highly prestigious Hamilton High School Academy of Music, in 2009, Rodriguez auditioned and gained entrance into one of the most selective jazz studies programs in the nation - USC’s famed Thornton School of Music. Now in her last year of college, she is set to complete her B.M. degree in Music Industry with a minor in Jazz Studies.

Accompanying Rodriguez in concert will be her 9-piece backing band, comprised of many of her classmates from Thornton’s Jazz Studies department. Since forming almost two years ago, the group has performed at some of the top venues in Southern California, including the Roxy and the House of Blues. Most recently, the band opened for hip-hop superstars J. Cole and Big Sean at the A.S.I. Hip-Hop and Comedy Fest hosted by CSU-Los Angeles. Currently, Raquel and company are hard at work putting the final touches on their first release, which will feature all new original material penned by the singer herself. The eponymous EP was released in early 2012.

Her full-length album, Miss Me, was released in June 2013. It marks a new, soulful direction for Rodriguez's music. Currently (late 2013), tracks from the album are available for listening at her official website, www.rqlrod.com.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Raquel+Rodriguez">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
