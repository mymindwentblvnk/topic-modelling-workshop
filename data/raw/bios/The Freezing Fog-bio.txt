Five serious men from Manchester pen groove laden hard/classic rock for their own and your pleasure. 

The debut 7" by the name of 'Solarperplexus' was released in May 2006 on the recently defunct Calculated Risk Products label, and was followed by a slew of gigs across their native England. In April 2007 the Debut Long Player, 'March Forth To Victory,' was recorded in Salem Massachusetts, USA. The album was released in the summer of 2007, on Roadkill Records, to critical acclaim across the board. Two songs were recorded in late December 2007 and they will become available in March 2008, again via Roadkill Records, on a split 12" single. A CD version of the release is also planned.

'March Forth To Victory' is going to be released worldwide on the 22/10/2008, via The Freezing Fog's latest label, Dental Records, based in Sweden. The re-release of the debut will feature two bonus tracks and come with a luxurious digipack take on the original artwork. 

The sophomore album (whch will be eponymous in its title) was recorded in the Summer of 2008 at Foel Studios in Powys, Wales. It has been mixed by Kurt Ballou at GodCity Studios, Salem MA, and mastered by Nick Zampiello at New Alliance East. It will be released in early 2009 on Eyesofsound Records, preceded by a single in digital format.
