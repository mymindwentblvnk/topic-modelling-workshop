There are four groups with this name: 

1) The collaborative project of Wil Bolton (Hibernate, Rural Colours, Time Released Sound) and Phil Edwards/PJE (Twisted Treeline, U-Cover, Crazy Language).
2) Polish Rock Band, formed in 1989
3) Mexican Rock band, formed in 2005
4) A metalcore band from the Limburg area of Belgium.

About the third one:

Mexican progressive rock band.
Members of this band have developped different styles (jazz, speed metal, progressive and dark rock) on some bands in the past, some of them working together before. These combinated styles created an original sound that have received good critics. 

This band was created in 2005 in Mexico City, appearing in very few small gigs (The Gathering Second Tribute Party) and as a supporting act for Elfonia's This Sonic Landspace Tour.

The band recorded in 2006 a demo including four songs, available for downloading on myspace.

Right now Ashlar is on recess, while their members work on other projects.
