Black Witchery is an American extreme metal band from Winter Springs, Florida. The band evolved in the mid-1990s after the dissolution of the Irreverent. It was originally known as Witchery, before adapting their current name in 1999. 

History:
The band issued a pair of splits and an EP before dropping their caustic debut album, Desecration of the Holy Kingdom, in 2001 through Full Moon Productions. In 2005, they signed with the French independent label Osmose Productions and released their second effort, Upheaval of Satanic Might, followed by a split album with Archgoat, entitled Desecration & Sodomy in 2008, which followed with a European tour of the two bands in 2017.

A live album, Live Desecration Ritual, was released in 2010. Their third full-length Inferno of Sacred Destruction arrived in 2010, followed by the Nuclear War Now! Productions-issued Evil Shall Prevail in 2016, the latter of which compiled tracks from the band's early demos and split EPs, and also included previously unreleased material. In February 2, 2016, former guitarist Steve "Tragende" Childers died as a result of a car accident at the age of 49. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Black+Witchery">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
