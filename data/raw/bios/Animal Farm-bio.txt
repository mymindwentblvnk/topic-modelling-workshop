There are several bands called Animal Farm.

1. A Hip-Hop group from Portland/Eugene, Oregon, USA. They have one album under their belt with help from the likes of Talib Kweli and Abstract Rude.

2. A punk band from London, England.

3. A Power Pop band (Dane Bowling live and in studio, with backing musicians live) originally from Indianapolis, IN.  Now based in Los Angeles, CA.  Singles were released beginning in the very early 90's, with worldwide EP releases in 2002 and 2009.

4. One of HP Gundersen's numerous bands. From Bergen, Norway, they released a selftitled album in 1994.

5. A band from Columbus, Ohio, USA. Confusingly, like the Norwegian band they also released a selftitled album in 1994.
