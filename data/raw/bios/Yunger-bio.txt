A fresh take on Rock music. Post-Hardcore outfit YUNGER pulls from unexpected genres like dark pop and shoegaze to reminisce about a simpler time when we all were younger, and life made sense. 

YUNGER began in Northern California in 2018 as a couple of guys passionate about creating rock music and playing shows. In 2020, Yunger entered the studio with Beau Burchell (Saosin, Senses Fail, Middle Class Rut, Hail The Sun) to create their second EP. With the upcoming EP, Yunger weaves grunge, shoegaze, emo, and dark pop elements into their songs, abandoning the expectations placed on modern rock music to forge their own path.

The Sacramento post-hardcore outfit aims to create organic and heartful music to present a message of hope through the lyrics, inspiring people to overcome their own struggles. 

Released on January 21st, YUNGER’s latest single, My Way Out is influenced by their vocalist’s very personal battle with drug addiction; Jay notes: “My Way Out is about finding your way out of the hell that is drug addiction. It was inspired by my personal experience of fighting through the darkest times in my life, only fueled by any essence of hope. I don’t wish this upon anyone, and I hope this song gives strength to people who need to overcome similar struggles.”

YUNGER is preparing to hit the road in 2022, and fans should expect the release of more energetic stadium anthems from their upcoming EP at the beginning of 2022. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Yunger">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
