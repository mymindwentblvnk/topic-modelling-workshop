EORONT was started in Krasnoyarsk, Russia since 2012 and represented one-man-band in the genre of atmospheric black metal. In the same year, the demo "Journey" was released and the recording of the first full-length album "Neverending Journey" was started. The CD was released in 2013 independently, it received a variety of positive reviews and enough interest in narrow circles.
In 2014 the German underground label WOLFSGRIMM RECORDS released the second album "Dhaar" consisting of two twenty-minute tracks. "Dhaar" was meditative shamanic black metal and laid the foundation for the Russian-language lyrics of songs. In the same year the full staff was recruited, the project began concert activity.
In 2015 the band signed a contract with the Italian label CODE666 (AURAL MUSIC GROUP) and began recording the next full-length album "Another Realm". All members of the band participated in the recording and production.
The name "Eoront" is the neologism invented by George "Foltath" Gabrielyan in the school years. It means the name of fantastic world with its own legends, myths, traditions and structure. Despite the fact that at the moment there are no direct references to stories from this world in lyrics, thoughts and fantasies about this place are always present in the process of creating music and in its atmosphere.
