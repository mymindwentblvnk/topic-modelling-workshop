Exsecratus was found by O. Mattila in the early spring 2004. Soon N. Hartikainen joined the band. After a few quick member changes, the first whole line-up was completed. During the following autumn E. Vihma and A. Päivinen were found to complete the new style of Exe.

Soon after new year '05 M. Niemelä took his place behind the drums and the name eXsecratus was decided to be the new name of the band.

In spring '05 Mr. Niemelä left the band due to musical and personal differences. Soon to leave was also E. Hartikainen because of his military service.

During the summer and autumn '05 new songs were made, and in early '06 T. Kauhajärvi became a fulltime member even before his first practice session with the band..

Later in the same winter ex-Elenium and Draugnim drummer J. Raatikainen joined the group to boost the effort to make it as a real, powerful and fast metal band.

In spring '06 E. Silvennoinen came along and filled the missing gap in the melody department. So Exe became stronger and made their first demo 19.8.-1.9.06, which was named execute.

On october -06 E.Vihma and A.Päivinen left the band due to personal difficulties between them and the rest of the band.
The following day L-M.Hovila filled the gap in lead-singing department.
And less than week from that, K.Rautiainen became a serious candidate for the soon-to-be-found solo-guitarist.

On January K.Rautiainen left Exe, and was replaced with T. Hentilä, a young guitarist from Vantaa. 

And so Exsecratus returned to the rehersal-place and started to kick some newbie-ass.
Not too long after that, Exsecratus as a fully functional metal-regiment once more and rose to the stages again in early december -06. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Exsecratus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
