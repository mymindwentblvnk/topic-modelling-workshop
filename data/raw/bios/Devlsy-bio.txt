DEVLSY- a fresh band from Lithuania, playing post-black metal. By the fall of 2013 released the first album "A Parade Of States". Low tuned guitars, distorted and singing bass with a black metalish vocal on top of it- that's the main recipe of DEVLSY music, in a few words. It's hard to predict if the guys have already created their own unique sound with their first record, but the first firm steps towards it have been made for sure.
DEVLSY already played a couple of live shows in local clubs and festivals and have plans to hit foreign venues and fests in 2014.
