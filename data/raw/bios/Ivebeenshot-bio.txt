IVEBEENSHOT is a three piece band from Cypress, California. Their 4 song demo "Stay Classy" contains 4 songs "inspired" by the film Anchorman. They also have a demo from 2003 called Fun for the Whole Family. Both of these demos can be found on various websites and contain lyric-less songs, being fronted by only death grunts and screams. 

Their full length, Doza was released in February 2008, and has been accredited as "one of the best-produced underground grind albums of this year."
