Agonhymn are a crushing, extremely detuned 2 piece from Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.  Originally a breakaway from an earlier Bendigo-based stoner rock band, Zuul, Liam (drums) and Dav (vocals/melodyhorn/samples/baritone guitar) decided there was much to be said for 2 guys sounding heavier than 6.  The band has released a demo tape (Telekinesis) and a full length (Doom Jazz), the latter of which which is available on the Heathen Skulls label.  Their second album, Blues Grind, is currently in production. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Agonhymn">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
