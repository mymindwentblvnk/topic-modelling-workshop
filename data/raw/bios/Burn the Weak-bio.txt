We formed ourselves in the early march 2010. We contain 5 young talented boys between 18 and 24 years. We aim for playing heavy death-metal paired with hardcore influences. After stereotypes always claim of being the most innovative and creating a completely new style, what to be honest is pretty impossible, we're trying our best to enrich the scene of heavy music with our own style. We hope to bring back the heavieness and melodical efficiency in metal.
