There are/were at least three artists by the name of Engage.

1. Engage is Dmitry Nekrasov from Saint-Petersburg, Russia. Heavily influenced by the likes of Corrupt Souls, Phace, Noisia and Spor among others during the neurofunk movement in 2004/2005, his desire to make music was unstoppable and he quickly focused his time and efforts to writing music and production. The results have been eye opening and Engage has recently been signed by Aesthetics and Trust In Music.
