The concept for ELDERTALE comes from its founder, Eugene Belozertsev, which consist to combine metal within traditional folk melodies of the Northern Slavs. This idea came in his mind back in 1998 while he was in his other Heavy Metal band named Tiara. He had to wait the year of 2004 with the find of the first bandmate, Kirill "Kirya" Shapovalenko, to shape this project for real. Kirya started in the band as a bass player but now manages vocals and guitar lines while Eugene Belozertsev also plays guitar. Therefore, ELDERTALE became a mix of Heavy metal, Power metal and Death metal influenced by Traditional Slavic Folk music. 
Due to many professional and personal issues, the duo turn this project on hold until Eugene Kozakov joins as bass player in 2007. ELDERTALE returns on hold in 2008 for the same reasons until late 2012, the arrival of Josh O.Berg and Alexander Desyatnichenko. The line-up is now complete.
ELDERTALE worked hard for their debut EP entitled “Land of Old” released online by June 2014 and for free 
exclusively. Now, the band is currently working on their debut album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Eldertale">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
