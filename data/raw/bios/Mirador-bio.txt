There are 3 bands under the name Mirador:" 

1) Formed in Sweden around 1991, Mirador are a doom metal band, stylistically rooted in both traditional doom and early progressive metal. Inspired by fellow label mates Veni Domine, they recorded their first and critically acclaimed album "The Azrael Tales" in 2005. The record featured extensive choral arrangements and melancholic sounds complimented by an original approach to doom metal songwriting, including flamenco interludes and atmospheric riffing. Kristian Niemann of Therion also provided an additional guitar solo on the album.

Line-Up:
Jakob Forsberg - Vocals
Erik Mjörnell - Guitars
Olof Gardestrand - Drums

2) Live electronics/post-rock project from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.  Mostly instrumental with occasionally ghostly bits of vocal samples materializing out of the ether.  Releases include Gold EP (July 2009), Chapel EP (March 2010), Verdant EP (October 2010), Northern EP (Jan 2011) 

"Mirador’s sample-based, carefully-crafted psychedelia takes you on a trip brimming with never-fulfilled apprehension; a suspenseful story." -Zen Tapes

"coming in like apparitions from a buried past, chiseling through the grime of everyday life as they build soundscapes with ebbing piano drops, echoing guitar lines and atmospheric samples. Dreamy and somewhat ominous - they still manage to find sci-fi type grooves." -The Deli Philadelphia
