Hailing from the East End of Germany, the Groovy Slam Death Grind-monstrosity TORTURE THE MASS supplies the scene with a delicious mixture of brutality and groove since 2005.

Founded as IDENTITY KILLS by guitar-player Nic and former member Oli, this fourpiece quickly established a solid fanbase with it's very own sound and it's interpretation of Death Metal. Until today, TORTURE THE MASS made friends and played with  Kraanium, Begging for Incest, Snatch Club, Mortal Agony, Waking the Cadaver, Mucupurlent, Waco Jesus, Cunt Grinder, Mucopus, Inferia and many more. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Torture+the+Mass">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
