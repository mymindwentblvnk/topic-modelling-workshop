Precaria define their style simply as "dark art", rather than black/death metal.

The band was formed by Ianzel "the Hermit", whose first recordings and ideas for Precaria date back to 2004, however, it was until 2010 when Opposus Discordia joined that Precaria officially debuted live as a duo, in Monterrey, Mexico, where cartel violence was at its peak.

The core members are currently located in the USA, Mexico and Italy. Various musicians have joined throughout the years to assist in live performances around Mexico. The lyrics are sung mainly in Spanish and English, with subjects ranging from occult, spiritual darkness to mundane violence and misery, with a strong focus on death. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Precaria">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
