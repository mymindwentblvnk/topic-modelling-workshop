Herniated Cunt was conceived by combining fast, chord-based rhythms, crunchy bass, double-kicks, and blast-beats with distorted shrieks and raw low vocals. Mix some some synth and the occasional sample with the often humorous lyrical content, and H.C. is a unique underground project in and of it's own right. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Herniated+Cunt">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
