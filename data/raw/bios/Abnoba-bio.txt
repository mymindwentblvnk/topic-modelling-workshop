Finally they're here, the standard bearers of an ineluctable, unmissable new generation of Italian folk music. Theirs is no sudden arrival, no overnight success story, but the fruit of a natural process of evolution that has slowly been ripening and is now ready to be savoured. In the hands, minds and ears of these six young men is everything required to build something lasting and solid: musicianship that combines real feeling with great technical accomplishment; the ability to listen both to one's own playing and to others' which has become a cornerstone of quality folk music; the ability to act their own age, embracing its virtues, and vices, with naturalness and spontaneity. Disarmingly vital, though not immune to the elegant gesture, widly captivating while capable of sudden moments of soul-haunting melancholy, theirs is a music that refuses the territorial boundaries of the old school, another sign of its contemporariness, a music that leaps over borders both physical and metaphysical. Abnoba are the group who today best incarnate the new dimension of Italian folk music, its transformation from genre to idea. Theirs is the moment we've been waiting for.
