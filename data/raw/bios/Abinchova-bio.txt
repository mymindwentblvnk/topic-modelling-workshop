Folk Metal from Lucerne

Heartfelt folk metal is the prime priority of the seven musicians of Abinchova.

Melodic tunes and crushing thrash and death metal riffs create the sound of this metal band. Guitar solos, fiddle and keyboard go hand in hand, to further enrich the structure of the music. Lyrically, the band has dedicated themselves to the telling of old tales and myths, which are brought to you by fierce screams and classical women’s chant.

Abinchova – A wave of music that transforms every concert into a beer soaked festivity.
