A pop rock band from Pennsylvania, The Romantic Era won multiple awards, sold thousands of albums, and rocked hundreds of stages. We give a sound to the nights where we feel most alive. Whether it is letting go and having a wild great time, or emotional love struggles, or the thirst to rule this world – we think a lot of people connect with our stories.

Our music is compared by the national press to that of Maroon 5, David Guetta, Fun., The Wanted and Calvin Harris.

Overall our band has a very unique edge, a party-animal personality and very exciting sound – when you listen to our music or come to our shows, it’s not just about listening to good music or watching a band. It’s like a party: we’re there with you having just as much fun as you are, whether it’s through the speakers or next to you up on the stage. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Romantic+Era">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
