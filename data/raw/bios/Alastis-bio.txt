Alastis were a Black Metal band formed in 1989 in Sion, Switzerland. Much like country-mates Samael, Gothic and Industrial musical elements played an important role in their sound during their later career, starting as a Rawer Black Metal sound before signing to Century Media records. 

Coincidentally, Samael's current vocalist/guitarist Vorph did vocals on the 1990 demo "Black Wedding" and Masmiseim (Christophe Mermod) played bass for the group before joining Samael in 1992. Former Alastis drummer Acronoise (b. Laurent Mermod) is also Masmiseim's brother.

They have had a successful, well-raved discography over their thirty one year career. However, their most recent 2001 album entitled "Unity" had no press or news release available since, and sources differ widely as to the current status of the band. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Alastis">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
