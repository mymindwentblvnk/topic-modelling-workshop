It’s always a pleasure to hear an artist emerge that doesn’t sound like anything you’ve ever heard. That doesn’t mean they haven’t been influenced by classic musical figures and genres, but it does have a lot to say when they can take a style, and make it 100% their own. This idea goes for 19 year old Rachel Geller, hailing from Minneapolis, MN. Ms. Geller, has fused Jazz, Blues, Soul, Hip Hop and at times Electronica and created something that you can’t not nod your head when you listen. Geller has yet to come out with an album, but her recordings, and live shows around the Minnesota area are starting to create some serious buzz. On songs like “Cool Down,” Rachel Geller takes her time to while she pours her soul into her words, creating the prefect vibe for anyone with a need for some quality blues. Then however, if you listen to the seductive dance song ”Future Butterfly,” where you’ll get a singer who emanates the likeness of Frou Frou, Beck, and even a little Bjork. Ms. Geller can change her voice, and genre, and yet still maintain her originality and fantastic ability to write incredible lyrics. Whether it’s the neo-soul “The Queen of Block E,” or her duet with Golden on “So Many Ways,” it’s hard to believe a voice and talent like the one you hear, which can easily be the voice of a 30 year old with years of the industry behind her belt, come from a 19 year old. Like fellow soul singer Joss Stone, Geller sounds beyond her years, a talent that can so easily be abused, or in the likes of Stone and Geller, bring a fresh and unique take on a genre that will draw both new and old listeners by the gazillions. Keep an eye out for this seductress of song. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rachel+Geller">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
