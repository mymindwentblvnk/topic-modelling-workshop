Varraghor is a vicious black metal quintet from (anti)-Christchurch, New Zealand. Varraghor delivers a raw and brutal yet melodic style of black metal in the vein of bands such as Gorgoroth, Emperor, Amon Amarth and 1349. After numerous obscure performances in their home city they have gathered a solid fanbase throughout New Zealand and have organised distribution of their music internationally through the French record label "Sound of Charge".
