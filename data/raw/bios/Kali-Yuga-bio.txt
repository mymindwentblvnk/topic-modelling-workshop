The project KHALI - JUGA was founded in autumn 2002 a.y.p.s. by Helga. The members of KHALI - JUGA define the music of the Band as Post Nuclear Art, a misanthropic psychodelic mix of ambient, noise, gothic. The leading conception of the project is Death, Nuclear Winter, the Sky, covered with the scab of grey dust, barring the way for the lights of the dying sun, the Wind wandering among the lifeless desolates of the post nuclear world... In March 2003 the work at the first album "Nuclear Winter" was finished. Now it is released by ARMOUR GET DAWN Prods. In the nearest creative plans of the band is to record the new album, where the the tendency towards Black Metal and Industrial would be evident.
