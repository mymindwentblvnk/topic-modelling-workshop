Beady Eye was an English rock band formed in 2009. The band consisted of vocalist Liam Gallagher and guitarists Gem Archer and Andy Bell, formerly of Oasis, rounded by drummer Chris Sharrock who substituted for Oasis during their last tour in 2008/2009, before Oasis broke up after chief songwriter and lead guitarist Noel Gallagher quit acrimoniously in August 2009. The remaining members gathered on and decided that they "will not quit making music together" and so they formed the band Beady Eye. In 2013, former Kasabian guitarist Jay Mehler joined the band.

The band released two albums Different Gear, Still Speeding in 2011 with a second, BE, released in 2013. The band has received general acclaim for their music by Oasis fans, with Q claiming that their debut album is the best Liam has performed on since (What's the Story) Morning Glory?.

They split up in 2014.
