Tanlines are an electronic and indie rock duo from Brooklyn, NY composed of percussionist Jesse Cohen and guitarist/vocalist Eric Emm.  Their influence is drawn from various genres including pop, indie, dance, and world music.  Tanlines' debut album Mixed Emotions was released on March 20, 2012 and reached #2 on the Billboard Heatseekers album chart.

Tanlines was formed in 2008 after Cohen and Emm worked together producing a song for Cohen's band, Professor Murder.  Emm had previously worked as a producer for other bands with his brother Joshua Topolsky and had also performed in the bands Don Caballero and Storm & Stress.  In 2009, Tanlines opened several times on tour for Julian Casablancas.

After releasing several remixes for bands that included Au Revoir Simone, The Tough Alliance, El Guincho, and Telepathe, the band collaborated with Salem to release a split EP entitled S.A.W. in early 2010.

The band's first EP of their own music, Settings, was released in March 2010 and was praised by Pitchfork as "an enjoyable listen" and "a punchy introduction to what these guys do well."  In November 2010, Tanlines released Tanlines, a compilation of all their released music up to that date and several other tracks and remixes.

The band has played with Vampire Weekend, The xx, Rick Ross, Yeasayer, Health, and Delorean. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tanlines">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
