Unleashing the blasphemous might of execration in 2005 anno satanas, Lord Ashir (guitars & vox) summoned two blasphemic infernal warriors Afreet (guitars & bass) and Belial Hatehammer (drums) to form a Black/Death legion and unleash the true strength of endless satanic odium: INFERNAL EXECRATOR was born!

In 2006, after the release of the band’s debut Demo, “Thy Demonization Conquers” which was self-released (ltd. to 100 copies), “Blood and Soil” (Spain) unleashed “Thy Demonization Conquers” on pro-tape limited to 500 copies. “De Umbris Production” (Greece) re-released it in 2009 (150 copies on pro-tape), with bestial raw blood rehearsal tracks included from the EP “Antichrist Execration” (2008).
INFERNAL EXECRATOR hellcomes a new warrior, Drakon (bass) into the Infernal Legion. Due to unforeseen circumstances, both Drakon and Belial Hatehammer left the legion soon after, leaving only Lord Ashir and Afreet for the Total Plague Of Total Destruction. Some session musicians helped out on the unholy path.

With the help of Christslaughter (drums) the EP “Antichrist Execration” was recorded and released by “Pulverised Records” (Singapore) in 2008 as an MCD in a Digipack, limited only 1000 copies. The tape version including a button and a patch was unleashed under the cursed banner of “Croquemort Productions” (Canada). The 12’’ MLP was released in 2011 under the glorious satanic banner of “Apocalyptic Empire Records” (Norway), limited to 666 copies (first 100 on red and black vinyl, including an embroidered golden patch).

After the blasphemous victory Afreet was axed out due to his loss of interest. Christslaughter (BLASPHERION) and Kommando Antichristo Xul (IMPERIAL TYRANTS) were summoned into the hell formation soon as the MCD was released. A new split with IMPERIAL TYRANTS was recorded and released in 2010 under the morbid banner of “Old Cemetery Records” (USA).
Upon morbid silence due to some reason in 2011, INFERNAL EXECRATOR has once again arisen and begun their work of death. In 2012 anno execratus “6 Execrating Years of Irreligiousatanic Elites”, a compilation from raw live ritual tracks and two new goat worshipping tracks was released under the unholy banner of “Evildead Productions” (Malaysia) (100 copies). The pro-tape version was later released by “Infernal Waves” (France).

INFERNAL EXECRATOR has invoked Necroshairan (guitar) for the legion for future ritual blasphemy. The productivity level rose again: A three-way-split with IMPETUO DESDÉM and TERROR SATAN (2012, Nyarlathotep Records, Brazil) and the single “Conglomeration Goatcult Profanextermination” (2013, Apocalyptic Empire Records, Norway) are proof that the cult is still alive and raging!
In 2014, the satanic hate regiment has unleashed their first album title “Ad Infinitum Satanic Adherent”. This album comes with few pressing with different artwork, photos,format & bonus track exclusively. 

Eastern Voice Production from Sarawak, Malaysia released the album consists of 9 destructive blistering tracks inclusive IMPIETY’s cover track from “Iblis Excelsi” Era strictly limited to 500 copies with 6 panel Digipack. First 123 copies come with an A3 poster & badge (Asian pressing). Dunkelheit Productions hailing from Germany released it with another artwork & bonus track exclusively & limited to 500 copies and first 100 comes with A2 heavy poster (European pressing). Apocalyptic Empire records from Norway unleashed the album on 12”LP format limited to 500 copies with different artwork as well a hidden track and first 100 are Gold vinyl. Rest are black vinyl.

No rest and no mercy for the weak, the legion will strike again with their upcoming split releases soon and the legion has signed with PULVERISED RECORDS, Singapore for the upcoming album in 2017.

INFERNAL EXECRATOR has desecrated few rituals together with IMPIETY, SURRENDER OF DIVINITY, PROCLAMATION, ARCHGOAT & SADISTIC INTENT and the band have annihilated their execration ritual in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines and a 12 dates European Tour together with NECROWRETCH in BELGIUM, GERMANY, POLAND, CZECH REPUBLIC, THE NETHERLANDS & FRANCE.
