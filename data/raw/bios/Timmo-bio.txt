Valeri Ivanov “Timmo” was born in Pleven, Bulgaria (1989). His talent in music was first sparked at the age of fourteen when he started composing music in popular genres. Despite the fact he was sixteen, he was drawn and fascinated by the underground clubbing scene. This new interest had an immediate impact on his own music productions.
By the end of 2009 Timmo got his first break in the music industry. His collaboration with his good friend PHM won the “WE LOVE...” contest and their remix of TRNSSTR’ “The Joker” was released on Timo Garcia’s Berwick Street. The remix was featured in Carl Cox Global and was one of the top arsenals of Timo Garcia’s own sets for a long time.

Timmo’s career was full speed ahead as he collaborated with Robin Hirte and having releases on some top labels such as BluFin, Moonbeam Digital and Stereo Seven Plus. His recent productions have been played and supported by the likes of Richie Hawtin, Popof, Marco V, Len Faki, Slam, Jon Rundell, Eric Entrena, Peter Gelderblom, Moonbeam and many more. By summer of 2009 he had launched his own radio show called “Big Room” on Bulgarian online radio of DJ Vibes. The show quickly became the next hot event that hit the airwaves and featured some top guests such as Robert Babicz, Umek, Fergie, Alan Fitzpatrick and many more.
