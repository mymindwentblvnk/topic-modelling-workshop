Mort's (also in Exiled From Light, Schizophrenia, When Mine Eyes Blacken, Balthazar, Serpenthrone, Nystagmus, Einsamkeit, Beyond Light, and Funereal) Atmospheric Black Metal Project. Beautiful Melodies and Absorbing Atmospheres, a sound with the potential to be uplifting yet still be depressive. A different side of Mort's multi-faceted musical path.
