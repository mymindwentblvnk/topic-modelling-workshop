Aratic is old school thrash metal band from Finland's west coast city Pori. After several line up changes and couple of years playing cover songs from Slayer, Megadeth, Pantera, Sodom just for fun while drinking beer, they found finally the right guys who had same kind of taste in music and same amount of passion for playing music (and drinking beer). They started making their own songs, and made even couple of demos, but were not yet even dreaming about having shows and etc, until january 2013 their fellow band Dual organized a show in neighbour city Rauma, and they really showed how big balls their music has.

Then things really started going fast. They started making their debut album, and sended some demos to record companies and Violent Journey Records liked them and signed them instantly. The article in local newspaper and a radio interview in local radio channel was only little compared to that they were asked after the interview to come play in Porispere festival 2.8.2013 with Municipal Waste, Suicidal Tendencies, Mors Principium Est and etc.

And after they got signed to Porispere, same guy who runs Porispere, organized a show in his club/bar and that was their first clubshow. Two weeks later they had a show in Manaus Event with some local bands. 

They released their debut album, To the early grave through Violent Journey Records 14.6.2013 at album release show at Bar Monttu. And after that they have had even more shows and even new songs has been made for the second album which is going to be even more darker, asskicking and diverse than the first record!
