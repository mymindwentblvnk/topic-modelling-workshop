In 1999, after different musical evolutions and various line-up changes, the group stabilised and thus the group Unhealthy Dreams was born. The music evolved towards atmospheric black metal and the band produced the demo "Vatican Armageddon"  with two songs recorded at Sound Suite Studio. They had found something remarkable in the underground and worked steadily for two years on promoting the band in different magazines and compilations in Europe. Unhealthy Dreams performed several concerts foreshadowing the recording of a new album. This one was realised in February 2001 at Tymix studio and, after various problems the group finished the album for their proper debut in 2003. "Nightmares Give Way To Apocalypse", the first album of Unhealthy Dreams, is now available with international distriubtion on Deadsun Records.   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Unhealthy+Dreams">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
