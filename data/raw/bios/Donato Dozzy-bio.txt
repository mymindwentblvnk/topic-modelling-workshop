Donato Dozzy (aka Donato Scaramuzzi) is a Rome-based DJ/producer. His brand of ambeint techno is lush and hypnotic to the point of being therapeutic. His recordings, as well as his DJ sets and performances, typically consist of slowly evolving washes of sound, with minimal yet detailed beats and occasional presence of natural sounds, or synthetic textures that imitate them. He first began releasing minimal techno singles in 2004 - often in collaboration with producers such as Brando Lupi and Giorgio Gigli - that sometimes contained more melodic work than his later material. In 2010, he began releasing full-length albums that were far more immersive than his singles. He especially received acclaim for Voices From the Lake, his project with Neel, who eponymous debut album appeared in 2012. Since then Dozzy's albums have become more conceptual, exploring limited source material, such as sounds produced by a single artist (Donato Dozzy Plays Bee Mask) or instrument (The Loud Silence, derived from mouth harp). His single and EP releases are more beat-driven, perfect for after-hours DJ sets that extend past sunrise. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Donato+Dozzy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
