Check us out on bandcamp!

A Rochester, MN based progressive atmospheric band that formed in mid 2010. Undergoing several lineup changes, but sticking to a core of 5 players, Amiensus has evolved into a genre-bending progressive metal band over the last 5 years of its existence.

The point of this band wasn't to really limit ourselves to a specific genre. The tags listed here are typically what we end up sounding like but we don't limit ourselves at all.

Our first full-length album: Restoration was released on Jan 1, 2013. Check it out on our bandcamp listed above. 
Our split with Oak Pantheon can be heard on our bandcamp and downloaded for free. it is called "Gathering" and was released Digitally and on hard copy on Nov 5th, 2013

Our second full length; Ascension, was released on 7/1/15 and is available via bandcamp as well as all major online retailers. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Amiensus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
