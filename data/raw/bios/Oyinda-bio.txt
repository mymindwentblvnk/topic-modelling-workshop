Oyinda is Nigerian-British singer-songwriter and producer. Currently based in New York City, her music combines electropop and shoegazing, among other influences. According to Clash Music, she "specialises in emotive, husky, down beat pop music. There's an R&B side to her delivery, with Oyinda seeming to pour her being into each word." Her first two singles, "Rush of You" and "What Still Remains," were released in 2014. Rolling Stone named her one of "fifty must see acts" for Lollapalooza in 2014, calling her "R&B's best kept secret." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Oyinda">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
