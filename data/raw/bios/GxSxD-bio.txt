nfluenced by several bands such as SLAYER,VADER&MORBID ANGEL,this band mainly plays DEATH METAL music.

Wicked Harmony taken everywhere, whirling heavy groove, and twin leads where it runs.
Terrific staging kept pushing to the end with three mainstays of speed・heaviness・aggression.
However, only not heavy.
The band has embodied true brutality.
