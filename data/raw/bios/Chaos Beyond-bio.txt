Chaos Beyond is a five-piece Vienna based metal band. Since making Schlager or Pop music is the easy path to stardom in Austria, the band instead decided to embark on the bumpy road that is metal!
Chaos Beyond - what does that mean? They do not know for sure themselves. But it definitely stands for fun on stage and passionate music. It all began in 2008 when Martin and Martin (confusing, isn't it?) had the weird idea to form a band. Since then, a lot has happened including genre, name and member changes. But where are they now? In the beginning of 2011 Chaos Beyond signed a record deal with Terrasound Records to release their debut album "Confessions Of A Twisted Mind". Be prepared. Chaos Beyond are making their way through the metal scene! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Chaos+Beyond">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
