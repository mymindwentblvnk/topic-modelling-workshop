Luna Shadows (born July 1, 1990). Is a multi‐instrumentalist and singer/writer/producer running her own show in the Los Angeles, California, United States since 2016. As the star of said show, she’s typically responsible for the writing, performing, recording, producing, engineering and editing of her music, although she’s recently brought in a couple of mainstream indie pop co‐producers, Brad and Thom of the respective bands Now Now and The Naked and Famous, to help shoulder the load.

Even the brightest, most upbeat Luna Shadows song carries a hint of romantic melancholy. She describes her artistic ambitions as a lifelong dare that, “sounded pretty fun” and brought order to the emotional chaos of everyday life. The end product, made in garages and bedrooms under the palm trees of Echo Park, sounds a bit like Ellie Goulding took Lana del Rey to the beach. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Luna+Shadows">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
