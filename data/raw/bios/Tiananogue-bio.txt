Tiananogue is a progressive hard-rock band from Japan. They consist of five members (Vocal, Guitar, Keyboard, Bass and Drums). 

They play gigs through Japan, mainly in Tokyo, Osaka, hoping to play overseas if there's a chance. 

They have released three CDs, "ETERNAL UTOPIA" which is our 1 st album (May 2001), "FREE MY SOUL" which is our 1 st single (Jan 2003), and the latest one called "Future Retrospective". They are always looking for a foreign music label that can make our materials spread worldwide. 

TIANANOGUE was named after Tir Nan Og, a country of a legend in a Celtic myth, Dana. Tir Nan Og ? the land of eternal youth- had been fantasized as the shining world of fairies. It is said to have lain beyond the western sea and be foreign to any disease, anguish, aging and death. By the way, the concept of “Eternal UTOPIA”, theirr 1 st album, came from Tir Nan Og. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tiananogue">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
