Men's Recovery Project was a musical group formed by Born Against veterans Neil Burke and Sam McPheeters in 1993.

MRP were known for their often extremely short and sometimes theatrical/performance art style sets. Sam McPheeters occasionally dressed as Patrick Henry while playing. The rest of the members sometimes wore masks, ladies lingerie, or children's clothing.

The group split in 2002 after McPheeters' asthma made touring impossible.

The roster for Men's Recovery Project included members from such groups as Wrangler Brutes, The Locust, Thrones, Rah Bras, Bikini Kill/Le Tigre, and Six Finger Satellite.
