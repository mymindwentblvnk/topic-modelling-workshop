Crushing death, blistering black and psychotic thrash are the key extreme metal elements that make up Azmaveth. Hailing from Ponce, Puerto Rico, this fresh metal combination is only the beginning of what we will experience as Azmaveth explodes on to the scene. Azmaveth born in 1999 when the spiritual decadence and the lack of preaching the word of God was present in the metal scene, but the idea was really conceived in 1998. Before we were call Azmaveth, we had another name EXOUSIA but two months after we started the ministry we found that there was another band with the same name, so we pray for a new name and one day studying the Bible we found the name Azmaveth who was one of the braves of King David and which name means strong as death for us this is the attitude a Christian must have in front of the Worlds pleasures, to defeat them. Our lyrics talk about diverse topics, from the implications of false doctrine and how these doctrines destroy the human being and their repercussions, we also talk about Gods Magnificence and His Sovereignty and the works redemption of Christ.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Azmaveth">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
