TLC is spontaneous studio project, came to light on the autumn 2014 turning point, aroused by the hunger for the music that is different from what we’ve got used to in our original bands. The sound of “Corona” is inspired by “atmospherity”, moods, emotions, protracted booming, dense tones and omnipresent grim. Lyrics at its first reading can evoke excessive apocalyptic tinge, tend to have a cathartic dimension and in a nutshell deal with existential aspects, with an emphasis on the lyrical integrity.

The recording took place in November 2014 with the help of Seabeast Production. The name of this two-track EP simply copies the launch year - 2015, "MMXV", nothing more, nothing less.
