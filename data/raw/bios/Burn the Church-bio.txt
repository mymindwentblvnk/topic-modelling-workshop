Burn The Church started in the summer of 2006 , by three satanic inspired 
people who found the idea of making a black metal band. After making 6 
songs they recorded a demo what was released december 2006 and gave 
a real great  chance to play gigs to the band . We are still looking for a 
label to release our new cd what is comming out this summer probably so if 
you have intrests to release this piece of crap then please post something 
on myspace or email us , for gigs also , check out our myspace for movies 
, music streams from the demo and more... <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Burn+the+church">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
