Ciaran 'Rocktron' Colton - Guitar and Vox, Brian 'STONES'Collins - Bass and Samples. Formed in Mar 2005. Four men with an unhealthy love for all things music got together to create some. Includes members of Madra, Stand-Up Guy, Pier19 and Eclectic (RIP).

Since the summer of 2005 Countervela have undergone lots of sporadic gigs and five tours: 4 Irish and 1 UK. One of the tours was supporting Belfast's Stand-up Guy and another was supporting Malta's Slit. The band have recorded their first EP which is now available and has three tracks of progressive, heavy and beautiful tunes. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Countervela">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
