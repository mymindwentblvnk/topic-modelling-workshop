The band Adonai Sathanas was founded by Laurens Jan and Bas (both guitar) in the summer of 2006. Daan (drums) and Ties (vocals) soon joined the band, and with this line-up they've recorded the full-lenght "Maan van Onheil" in 2008.
Shortly after that, a bassist (Stefan) joined the band, and their music became more melodic and more sinister than ever before.
In this new line-up they've recorded the MCD "De Duistere Eeuwen", published 25th may 2009.
Shortly after the release of this album, bassplayer Stefan left the band to be replaced by Marcel.
Two other albums were also recorded: Gods Hoer (promo single 2007) and Eternal Winter (never released).

Ties (Haatzaaier): Vocals (F.O.A.G.A. Tergernis, guest for Dodenrijk)
