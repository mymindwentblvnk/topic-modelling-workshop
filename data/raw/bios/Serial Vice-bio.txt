Serial Vice are an Heavy Metal band based in Southern Italy. After some line-up changes, the band recorded their first single Heroin and after yet more tweaks to the personel, the bands sound gelled into a Heavy Metal blast somewhere between classic and modern but always gritty and melodic. They cite their influences from Hard Rock to Thrash and from Doom to Power. The bands EP Nightmares Come True, is scheduled for release on Sliptrick Records in 2017. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Serial+Vice">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
