Two years ago, 4 kids (Nuno-vocals, Gon√ßalo-drums, Dani-bass, Renato-guitar) started a band, maybe because their lifes were just too boring and their minds needed some distraction. Soon the will to create something that would not sound like an ordinary garage band stood up to be the primary goal. Described by a friend as King Crimson on steroids, the sound reveals a chaotic vision constructed and ordered in a progressive way, which turns each song into an endless journey of different scenarios. Monogono's main influences are King Crimson, Meshuggah. Amuk, the debut album, was recorded in The Edge studios (Aires, Portugal), produced by Alessandro Devillart and assisted by Vitor Guerreiro. Amuk is the first open window into the world of Monogono, yet just a glimpse of what the future may bring.
