Necropsia is a hardcore band from Debrecen, Hungary. The band was founded in 1992 in the city of Debrecen by Krisztián Pósafalvy, Gábor Gazda and István Szilágyi. Shortly after it, Zsolt Bodnár and Balázs Kálmán joined the band, and they recorded their first demo in that year. In 1993, the band recorded their second demo called Trans Express, which received good critics, and they won the first Hungarian Marlboro Music Rock-in Talent Scout competition with it. 

In 1994 they played before Biohazard at the Petőfi Hall, and in 1995 they released their first full-length album, "Mélység"(Depth). The album was welcomed and sold about 10.000 copies. It was their height of success. 

After it they had some lineup changes, and in 1997 they recorded their critically acclaimed second album in a trio formation. The songs of "A magány rítusai" "(The Rites of Solitude) showed a heavier, more technical band. 

From 1998 to 2003, the band was inactive. Some of the members were changed, and in 2003 they released their third album, "Mítoszok romjain" (On The Ruins Of Myths). They mixed the original hardcore sound with the elements of other styles, like hip-hop and jazz, and the result was this modern album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Necropsia">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
