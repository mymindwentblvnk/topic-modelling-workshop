Their first album "Shrouded Divine" was released on January 2nd, 2008. The album was extremely well-received, especially considering it's a debut album.

Recorded, mixed and mastered at Abyss and Black Lounge studios, Grangärde, Sweden in sessions during the period August – December 2011, the album was released on April 18th, 2012. As was explained in an interview, "the concept this time is a story of a man with a great fear of the ocean, he gets convinced by a bunch of old sailors to head out on a journey on the ocean to conquer his fears. The whole album then tells this mythological story of his journey traveling the waves and encountering all kinds of adventurous things like giant sea-monsters, storms and deserted islands."  

"The Weight of Oceans" has received positive reviews from multiple sources and currently sits at an 83% average percentage in the Encyclopaedia Metallum Metal Archives.

On January 16th, 2014 it was announced that drummer, Christian Netzell had decided to leave the band after 14 years of playing due to musical differences.
