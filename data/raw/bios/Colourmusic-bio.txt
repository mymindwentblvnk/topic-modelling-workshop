Colourmusic began in Stillwater, Oklahoma by composing music based on Sir Isaac Newton's theories of sound and colour.

Following the release of their self-recorded/produced debut EP inspired by the colour red, the band began entertaining local audiences with a variety of thematic shows, including a fake graduation, a mock prom, and a wedding.

So far, the band has been played on over 160 college radio stations and has been featured on Billy Zero's XM Radio show, the Radar Report, which highlights the nation's best unsigned bands, and has licensed their music to the MTV Network for use on several programs.

The band will be releasing the "Yellow EP" in the summer of 2006 and are currently booking a national tour.
