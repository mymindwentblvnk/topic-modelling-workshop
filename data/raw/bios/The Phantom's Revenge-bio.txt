The Phantom's Revenge is an up & comer from the house capital of the world: France. To be precise, he hails from Nimes, France. At the ripe age of 23, he has a staggering set of singles floating around in the underground french house scene as well as a huge remix collection.
      
His style is most definitely French house but is ultimately defined by his sampling of long-forgotten funk and disco gems. Most of his samples contain riffs from the mid to late 70's to early 80's funk or groove r&b, which put a classic spin on a new face. 

With France producing such important electronic artists as Guy Manuel de Homem Christo and DJ Falcon, The Phantom's Revenge can only do more to maintain France's stronghold on the house music scene. His chopping and glitch cuts occur nearly seamlessly and showcase his undeniable talent behind the boards.

He states his influences as: DJ Falcon, Daft Punk, DatA, David Bowie, David Rubato, Dazzle, Cold War Kids, Candi Staton, Boys Noize, Armand Van Helden, Electric Light Orchestra, Herbie Hancock, Ian Pooley, John Julius Knight, Justice, Kanye West, Louie Vega, Michael Jackson (the 80's old era), N.E.R.D., Paul Johnson, Pharrell Williams, Prince, and many more. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Phantom%27s+Revenge">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
