Luddite Clone was a band from Bridgewater, New Jersey. They formed in 1998 out of the ashes of another local band, Nuvi, and released a successful split with Burnt by the Sun in 2000 on Ferret Records, a local label that has since gone on to make a name for themselves through other artists. The split led to a deal with Relapse Records, a label which specializes in grind/metal releases. That relationship led to the band's lone release, The Arsonist and the Architect (which had been issued prior to the band's split release with Burnt by the Sun independently), being reissued by the label in 2000. After a year of playing shows and lending songs to various compilations and splits, the band broke up. Andrew Cummings and Kevin Hannum went on to form Kiss the Cynic following the break-up.
