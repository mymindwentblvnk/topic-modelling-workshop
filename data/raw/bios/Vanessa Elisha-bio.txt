In the last few months, 22 year old Australian writer/singer Vanessa Elisha, has gone from self proclaimed "unlikely R&B star" to 2013’s one to watch.  Thanks to support from several hundred blogs, her debut release, "Blur" found its way onto playlists and iPhones across the world, with the self-edited video teaser amassing over 40,000 views. Reuniting with production partner GXVXNS, Vanessa quickly followed up with the video for "Home To Me," and attracted the attention of a whole new legion of supporters.

After spending the following months fine-tuning the project, Vanessa released her EP "Don't Go." The 5 Track offering premiered on the front page of Jermaine Dupri's Global14, and began spreading across the internet like a Kanye West rumour. Within hours of it's release, "Don't Go" was seen across some of the world's most influential music blogs like Hypetrak, The Singers Room, The 405 and more. The 17-Minute offering showcases Vanessa's unique ear for melodies, set to the haunting noir-esque production of GXVXNS and CVIRO.
