On March, 9th, 2008 four very different musicians rallied the call to play technical and progressive music. Since that day the existence of Lost Conception has begun. A  genre like Progressive Death Metal isn't just a description. It describes the absence of any stylistic framework. You can find the power of Death Metal, the cold ice of Black Metal, the apathy of Doom Metal and echoes of various creative genres in Lost Conception music. 

Lost Conception is inspired by bands, like Death, Anata, Behemoth, Belphegor, Arsis, Blood Red Throne, Deicide, Decapitated, Necrophagist, Emperor, Apathy, As I Lay Dying, Immortal, Gorguts and others. The variety and power of ice and cruelty - that's what you will hear. They don't accept current society and human nonsense. You change not change the world with force, so for them, to sing about it is their calling. 

They played together with Apokefale, Exventer, Demon Project, Welikoruss, Ashen Light, Put Solnca and Izmoroz. In the autumn of 2009 Lost Conception released their first EP "Pathetic Existence" through the Internet. In June 2011 their debut album "Paroxysm of Despair" will be released on Darknagar Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lost+Conception">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
