Under the moniker ‘Future Utopia’, globally acclaimed artist and producer Fraser T Smith releases his debut album, ’12 Questions.’

The album sees Fraser taking centre stage and features an incredible roll call of some of Britain’s most vital and brilliant artists. Stormzy, Dave, Kano, Ghetts, Bastille, Es Devlin, Simon Armitage, Idris Elba are just some of the names featured on the album.

The album is based on a series of twelve universal, human and urgent questions, all born of Fraser’s own anxieties about the world today. The album discusses issues including faith, freedom, race, gender, wealth, equality and ecology.

Fraser T Smith has worked with the likes of Adele, for whom he co-wrote and produced the Grammy winning single Set Fire To The Rain (2011), as well as Stormzy, whose BRIT Award winning debut album Gang Signs & Prayer (2018) Fraser wrote on and produced.
