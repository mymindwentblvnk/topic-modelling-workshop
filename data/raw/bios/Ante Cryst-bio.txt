Ante Cryst was formed in 1997 by Wyrm and Hygegeomor, who recorded rehearsal demo tape called "The Gaunt Hill". In 2005 Unknown Ikon joined on guitar. After writing new material, a second rehearsal demo tape was released called "Malicious". Due to some personal differences between themselves, both Wyrm and Hygegeomor decided to leave the band. Unknown Ikon recruited new members and continued under a new name - AnXpm. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ante+Cryst">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
