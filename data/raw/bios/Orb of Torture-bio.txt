orb of torture is the physical embodiment of an undying lust for waves of sound of five individuals, who had already been travelling paths to cosmic riff and rhythm continuum for many years. the orb materialized in june 2002 as the visions of these five eclipsed and through the subsequent darkness their saturnian destiny was imposed on them. we highly value a scene nor herd mentality and try to create music that flies in the face of those who are too comfortable with the way things are, make them question if what they're satisfied with is really enough. this can be threatening to the uninitiated but those who have a release for this know that if this happens, if you are pushed to respond, or start a search, you actually feel a greater sense of being alive. one might say that it is contradictory that we try to achieve this by playing a music aligned with death, and in a genre that is quite rigid and perhaps even stagnant. to these detractors we say; fuck off and forget that thee art brethren. we have our reasons, and they course through our veins! energy, strength and anger are currently the key elements to our music and it is then perhaps not surprising that it manifests itself as twisted and technical old school death metal. our vision is quite singular, however, influences of the old masters are evident and, as true maniacs know, essential. may we live in humility and inspiration by the examples set. orb of torture brings you dissident death metal exclusively
