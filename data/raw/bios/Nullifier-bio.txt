1) Heavily and unashamedly influenced by the Brazilian Metal Gods and the Nullifier are a NZ three piece Metal Powerhouse based in the Central Auckland area, comprising of

Warren Mathieson – Guitars,
Nick Milat – Bass/Vocals
Allan McLachlan – Drums.

Specialising in Aural Devastation, heavily and unashamedly influenced by the original wave of Thrash/Death Metal, the golden Era of a timeless genre. More specifically bands such as Overkill, Obituary, Death, Pestilence, Kreator.

Late 2008 saw Nullifier record and release the demo:  Resurrection of the Billy Goat, which received much positive feedback from the metal community and getting airplay on radio stations - The Rock’s “The Axe Attack” and BFM’s “Hard Fast and Heavy Show”.

2009 and Nullifier, never content with merely existing, persisted in spreading the infection of their sound playing shows alongside bands such as: Upraw, Anabyss, Heavy Artillery, Bloodletting, Never Repent & Malevolence.  More recently playing the Metalfest/Metal Society shows with more accomplished acts such as:  Blacktooth, Metal Tower, Sinate & Just One Fix.

Currently recording an EP yet to be named, with the plan of recording again in Early 2010, Nullifier will soon again be thrashing it out on a stage near you.  Be prepared.  Nullifier was born to UNMASK!


2) Vast space-pop supergroup from Brighton, UK

"The band, bolstered by numerous superfluous-looking extra 'electronic dudes' and percussionists, sounded utterly vast from the get-go. Imagine pre-Erol Late Of The Pier with a special mystical ruby ring that banishes all the dad's record collection prog-shlock, replacing it with a giddy, clattering astral fischerprice power."
NME

"Glorious melodies and the catchiest choruses of the year- an indie space disco riot"
