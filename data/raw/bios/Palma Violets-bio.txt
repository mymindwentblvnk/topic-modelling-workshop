Following the release of their 2015 album Danger in the Club, there was a noted silence from the band on social media leading to speculation that the band had split up. This was confirmed in an interview by Matt Wilkinson with guitarist Sam Fryer on 11 July 2018. All the members of Palma Violets bar Alexander "Chilli" Jesson are currently in a new band called Gently Tender with Celia Archer of The Big Moon. Of the affair he noted "We didn't fall out or anything like that. We just changed as people. We were 18 when we started the band and everything is quite easy to get on the same page, write the same kind of music all the time. Whereas when you hit 24 after 5 years of touring, I think you just become different people and we naturally just moved on" <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Palma+Violets">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
