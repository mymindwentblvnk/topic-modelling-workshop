Infernorama is a progressive Gothic Metal band from the Netherlands

Manny van Oosten earned his stripes in 1984 when Roadrunner released Black Out's highly acclaimed debut album "Evil game" worldwide. In the years after he deserved further appreciation through three rock-opera's. After that he devoted himself to gothic-metal and released two successful albums with the band To Elysium. Still his source of inspiration is inexorable and now he has combined all the foregoing in INFERNORAMA. Manny got the help from various fellow-musicians he came to know through the years. What to think of appearances by members of bands like ex-WITHIN TEMPTATION, EPICA, THE WOUNDED, ALTAR, THE MONOLITH DEATHCULT, DELAIN, SERAPHIQUE, TO ELYSIUM. The performers live up to their reputation so that INFERNORAMA can withstand the subsequent comparison with similar projects.
