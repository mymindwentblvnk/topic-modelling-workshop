Stefan Kozak is Eikenskaden, a "French touch black metal" project. The sound that Kozak has chosen goes slightly outside the norm for black metal, and although it retains the rawness and the sepulchral, ominous soundscapes universally endorsed by the genre, he also incorporates a kind of noble virtuosity to the music, lending it a neo-classical sounding, harmonic edge.  This nature makes this one man project unique amongst its black metal brethren, in France as well as worldwide.

There have been releases on Cybertzara (blackmetal.com), tUMULt, CHANTELOUP, and Weird Forest. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Eikenskaden">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
