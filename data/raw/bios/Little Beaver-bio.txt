Willie "Beaver" Hale aka Little Beaver is a seminal Miami soul singer, songwriter and guitarist.  His lazy grooves and smokey vocals conjure a steamy Miami summer vibe.  He reached U.S chart success in 1974 with "Party Down" the title track to his 3rd album released on CAT records.  Willie also featured on guitar in many sessions during the 70's most notably playing the chiming riff on Betty Wright's "Clean Up Woman".  Willie reappeared recently, this time working with young U.K soul prodigy Joss Stone. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Little+Beaver">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
