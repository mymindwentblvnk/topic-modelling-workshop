Ex- members of Gang Green. Boston's Chuck Stilphen, Glen Stilphen and Walter Gustafson from Alcohol / Skate to Hell-era GG join Morgan Keating (vocals). Originally released in 1990. These guys were players in several Boston bands including Gang Green, The Freeze, The Straw Dogs, The Outlets, Scratch, and Smegma and the Nunz. This one leans more to the rock-metal side of things from these original punkers. "Yeah Yeah" and "Give and Take" are the standouts. See also: Scratch 7 Song EP @ (http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/scratch22 ) for later Stilphen brothers releases.
