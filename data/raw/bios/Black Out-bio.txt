Black Out was born from a meeting, a passion and a desire ... to meet and Oxadis deCécile, their passion for music, the desire to compose Oxadis still and unsatisfied desire for Cécile to run headlong into this adventure!

Composing music for over twenty years, the Oxadis influences are diverse and varied. Rock, metal, trip-hop to hip-hop, all music genres spend. Cecilia, meanwhile, writes and sings the last ten years focusing on English for "the musicality of language", but this in great secrecy before his meeting with Oxadis. Coming from a more jazz influence and trip-hop, she began the composition in order to give itself "body" in his texts.

Black Out is the fusion of two personalities, two different musical worlds, giving them music that touches something so personal and so recognizable. Influenced by groups such as Archive, Portishead, Massive Attack or Morcheeba, Black Out likes to make their planing and tribal music, letting himself be inspired to go over the tracks.

This young group, formed in October 2005, composed at breakneck speed, yet leaving the scene later. Not stopping to compose only for sleep, to the delight of our ears, like Black Out juggle moods and it's effect!
