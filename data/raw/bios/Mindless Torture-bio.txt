Mindless Torture are a death metal band from the West Midlands, formed in October 2006 when Gaz was doing security at Club Juice on the night Shadie and Anil played there with their other band Necrotize. The trio bonded after talking about musical aspirations and the desire to form a real death metal band. They began rehearsing soon after, and a few weeks later Karl was recruited on second guitar. After auditioning many bassists who just did not meet the standard, Karl volunteered to take up this role.

In May 2008 the band underwent a lineup change with the departure of Karl and the addition of a second guitarist called Tom. Former Life Denied bassist Nigel stepped in to replace Karl but as the summer came to a close so did Nigels time in Mindless Torture. He was replaced by Frank shortly after.

The Mindless Torture EP which featured the original lineup was then released via iTunes in late 2008 through Dissected Promotions.

With merchandise selling at an intimidating rate and word spreading fast about Mindless Torture throughout the UK's metal scene, 2009 is looking to be a great year as they support such legendary metal acts as Soulfly and Testament.
