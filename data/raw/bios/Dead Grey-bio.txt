Dead Grey is a new Calgary Thrash metal band with influences grounded mainly in the Swedish metal scene... The current line-up is composed of three members, though the band is currently searching for a full time bassist and a vocalist. The bands history starts in 2002 when Mark and Andy began jamming just to play something a little heavier than either had been. Then they found Tim (who was originally slated to play bass) to pick up the other guitar duties. They recorded, mixed and mastered their debut CD at The Beach Advanced Audio in Calgary with engineer Todd J. Al and produced by Mark Senicki. Dead Grey have appeared on CJSW's Megawatt Mayhem show, and are currently working on a song to submit to Bravewords and Bloody Knuckles' CD sampler: Knuckletracks. Expect the song in the April edition of BWBK. "Towards Nothing..." is Dead Grey's first album released on Mark Senicki's own Audio Blasphemy Productions. It is available online at www.deadgrey.com or if you are in the Calgary Area, it is also available at Play Entertainment and Megatunes. Dead Grey's official site is currently being destroyed and reborn in a more professional light. Check back for updates either here on their Myspace, or at the official Dead Grey site.
