Mark Stewart first made an appearance under his Claro Intelecto pseudonym in early 2003 - his remarkable “Peace of Mind” 12” fast becoming the most discussed dance floor debut for years and enjoying re-presses now heading for double figures. In 2005 he became a well-respected member of the Modern Love label family. 

His productions are club-honed, taking in influences from Warehouse classics that accompanied him in Manchester's internationally revered clubs like the Hacienda, Home and Paradise Factory. His "Warehouse Sessions" series has gained him the much coveted No.1 spot in Berlin's Groove Magazine for the third volume in the series. His last album "Metanarrative“ was released in October 2007. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Claro+Intelecto">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
