Born in 1995, Eternal Majesty has developed his own vision of Black Metal to celebrate your inside Darkness. With his mid tempo, speed, a little bit melodic and depressive Black Metal, added arrangements are creating dark and cold atmospheres. Now Eternal Majesty is a vision beyond good and evil, a spectator of human misery.
