In case you didn’t know Frank Carter is the former Gallows and Pure Love front man – two bands that couldn’t be much further apart if they tried – one that pushed punk and hardcore into the British mainstream, the other are more upbeat expansive sound. His new project Frank Carter & The Rattlesnakes is firmly in the camp of angry snarling and fierce. They emerged seemingly out of nowhere in early 2015 with the single ‘Fangs’, which they soon followed up with an EP, "Rotten", in May, and their debut album, "Blossom", in August. In January 2017, the band released “Modern Ruin”, following it up with their third full-length in May 2019, “End of Suffering”. These releases saw a noticeable shift in style from their previous ones , from punk to a more alt-rock sound. On October 15th 2021 the band will be releasing their 4th studio album 'sticky'
