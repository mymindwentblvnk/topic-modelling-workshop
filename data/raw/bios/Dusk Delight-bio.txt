Dusk Delight was formed in 1998 by Andy, Dali, Blaz and Dyz. In 2000 they entered the studio for the first time, with the end result being a 2-track demo, released in 2001. They entered the studio again in 2002, with the product finished a year later. Before the release of the album, Dyz would leave the band to be replaced by Dado. The debut full length album 'Stories' has now been released. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dusk+Delight">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
