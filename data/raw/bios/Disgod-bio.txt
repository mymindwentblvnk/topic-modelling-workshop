The band has been active since 2003 and it has a very high reputation in the homeland. The band's line-up comprises musicians known for participation in leading Belarusian metal-acts, such as Medievil, Warkraft (changed name to Ion Disruption), Barracuda, Psychopathic Noise (changed name to Mental Extermination).

The demo "Contaminated Surgery" released in 2005 received excellent responses in underground media and that at once has allowed the band to receive an offer for the release of its debut album from cult Belarusian underground label Possession Productions. In 2007 the full-length album "Sanguine Scales" was recorded and in the end of 2008 Possession Productions released this CD.

The band is active in terms of live-shows. Belarusian gigs earned the band the status of the excellent live-act. It is worth mentioning that DISGOD live-show is notable for bright barbarous power. When performing live the potential of band's music manifests itself even more than on the album and that is repeatedly noted by different gig reviews. Performing as a trio - using minimal possible line-up - the band delivers the drive and power which will easily outdo other bands with much greater number of musicians.

The concept of the band is based on classical death - thrash metal-basis from the end of 80-ies and the beginning of 90-ies that is passed through the prism of today's up-to-dateness and modernity. DISGOD recreates metal spirit of the times that once were but at the same time doesn't undertake the task to follow the paths that had been already passed by others, and creates something original and modern on the basis of tradition. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/DISGOD">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
