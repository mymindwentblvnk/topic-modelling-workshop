Displaying utmost quality and precision within his productions, it comes as no surprise that Artifact is one of the most anticipated up and comers in Raw Hardstyle. Since signing to End of Line Recordings in 2015, this young prodigy has taken the scene by storm with A-class tunes such as “Shakedown,” “Do You Like Bass?” with Delete, “Journey of Ecstasy” with Warface, Elke Donkers & Sovereign King and “Buried Alive,” to name a few.

Displaying edgy and boundary-breaking productions that exhibit impressive flair, Artifact’s rebellious sounds have guided him all the way to performing at major festivals such as Dominator, Defqon.1, Q-BASE, The Qontinent, Intents Festival, Masters of Hardcore and Supremacy, amongst others.
