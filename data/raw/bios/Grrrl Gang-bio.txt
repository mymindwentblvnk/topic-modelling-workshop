This is Angee (vocal & guitar), Edo (guitar), and Akbar (bass). Since we watched them for the first time a few months ago, we were pretty much sure that Grrrl Gang is really what we’ve been looking for: sweet pop riffs and melodies, a sense of bitterness and melancholia, provocative-honest lyrics, fuckyouandyourcoolfriends attitude, and dead serious internet jokes. They were born in 1995, 1996, and 1997, but we’ve never met any other kids their age who offer such musical sensibility that Grrrl Gang has got in hand.
