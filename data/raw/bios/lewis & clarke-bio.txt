Lewis & Clarke is the 'nom de plume' of Lou Rogai with collaborators: Karen Codd, Tom Asselin, Ian O'Hara & Shane O'Hara (brothers). The moniker has been described as metaphor for journey on many levels: musical, spiritual & physical. Rogai is quoted, by Daytrotter.com, describing the project: "a vessel crafted for many, but operable alone if need be." The name is also a reference to the fellowship / correspondence between C.S. Lewis & Arthur C. Clarke. Rogai is credited as composer / musician / songwriter, as well as, founder of La Société Expéditionnaire (cooperative record label, dedicated to exposing the wild and/or fragile music). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lewis+&+Clarke">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
