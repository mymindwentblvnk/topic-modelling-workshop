In 1992, Jones was joined by Martin Parker (drums, percussion), who together are the band's nucleus. They have released nine albums and six singles (on Summerhouse). Their latest album is Spangleland (May 2007).

Their lyrics span incurable optimism to dark miserableness and influences include: Teardrop Explodes, The Chameleons and 70s acoustic, e.g. Nick Drake and Renaissance. Spangleland is stylistically atypical, featuring somewhat weird epics.
