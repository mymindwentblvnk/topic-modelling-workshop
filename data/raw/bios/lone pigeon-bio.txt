.....For once in your life do something different....

The Lone Pigeon, AKA Gordon Anderson, was the singer/songwriter and co founder of The Beta Band, and is currently the lead singer of The Aliens, along with Robin Jones and John Maclean of the Beta Band.

By the time the Beta Band signed to Regal Records, he was forced to fly home to Scotland due to mental ill-health, and subsequently proved too ill to rejoin the London based band, with Steve Mason taking over as frontman. His co-writing credits include "Dry the Rain", "B + A" and "Dogs got a Bone" from the "Champion Versions" EP, and "The Cow's Wrong" on The Beta Band's debut album. 

Back home in Fife, The Lone Pigeon has continued to work as a prolific musician and artist and has become an integral member of the Fence collective (A micro-indie label and collective of northeast Fife bands - Billy Pilgrim, Gummi Bako, James Yorkston, King Creosote, Pip Dylan - The Fence collective have quietly been writing and recording songs for years with little regard for the music industry, simply handing out CDs to friends or anyone listening, yet producing some of the most exciting home-grown music to grace Britain).

His new band, The Aliens, released their first album "Astronomy for dogs" in 2007 to critical acclaim, and their new album "Luna" is scheduled for release in September 2008. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lone+Pigeon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
