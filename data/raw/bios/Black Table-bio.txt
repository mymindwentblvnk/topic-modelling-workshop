Black Table is an experimental black metal band from New York and New Jersey. It was formed in 2010 by guitarist/vocalist Mers Sumida, guitarist Ryan Fleming, and drummer Michael Kadnar. Matt Mellon joined as bassist in 2011. Fleming and Kadnar were previously in the New Jersey metal band Randall Flagg, and Mellon was an original member of the technical jazz metal band Mabus. Mellon left the band in 2014 and was replaced by DJ Scully.

Black Table self-released their debut single "Heist" on May 16, 2012, followed by their debut EP Sentinel on December 17 of the same year. This was released on black vinyl, limited edition white vinyl, and a limited edition CD-R with a handmade silkscreen canvas print in a vellum envelope. It also received limited cassette runs, including a second pressing of only six red tapes.

In 2016, Black Table released their debut full-length album Obelisk, through Silent Pendulum Records, the label run by Kadnar. It was produced by Billy Anderson and its cover art features a painting by French artist Eric Lacombe.

On May 1, 2018, Black Table announced that they would be taking an indefinite hiatus.
