Halahkuh is a four piece Death/ thrash metal band from Pune, India formed in January 2011.

Halahkuh as a quartet is a destructive unit,having derived its name from a ruthless mongol ruler HULAGU KHAN(descendant of the famous mongol ruler GENGHIS KHAN), depicts the same kind of intensity and power in their music. The music speaks about the harshest moments and the struggles we face in our day to day life. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/HALAHKUH">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
