After several demos and appareances in some dub compilations (Digital Park, Dub Excursion, Dub in France...), WEEDING DUB joined together on vynil some "home made" stepper tunes issued by human and musical meetings. This first album called "STEPPACTIVISM", out in february 2004, is anchored in a stepper & conscious dub concept which is particularly developed in the UK and which is the digital reflect of the reggae music's evolution.

Largely influenced by this english dub scene (from Aba Shanti I to Iration Steppas, while passing by the Bush Chemists, The Disciples or Vibronics), WEEDING DUB also feels close to french artists like Improvisators Dub, Uzinadub, Miniman or Manutension.

Moreover, one finds in this first LP sure values of the french dub scene which are Manutension (Improvisators Dub) and Na√Øma Mansi (Dubians), and international artists like Neil "Zion Train" Perch or Steve Vibronics which came to bring their contribution to the "made in France" stepper.

Accompanied by the english-jamaican Humble I in live (of which the microphonic interventions reflect the "nice & conscious" state of mind of the group) Weeding Dub proposes his "dub sessions". In more of the versions of this first LP every time remixed, there can be found new and promising tunes of a NEXT ALBUM IN NOVEMBER 2K8!!  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Weeding+Dub">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
