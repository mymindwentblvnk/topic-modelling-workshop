Godsleep formed in middle of 2010 in Athens, Greece.Five people with common music interests, high aspirations and will for creation combined for the same purpose.The result? Loud,Down-Tempo Heavy-Rock with stoner elements.
The band released a promo with 4 tracks, one of them participating in a rock compilation by 272 Records (California). As a band which respects itself, they have done many lives the last 2 and a half years all over Greece, sharing the stage with many bands such as La Otracina, Kadavar, Nightstalker, Talbot. Their live career peak was their opening slot at Freak Valley Festival 2012 at both of its days in Germany, supporting bands like Colour Haze, My Sleeping Karma, Mars Red Sky, Lonely Kamel and Gentlemanâ€™s Pistols. Right now they are in the studio recording their first full length album which can be expected hopefully in this year
