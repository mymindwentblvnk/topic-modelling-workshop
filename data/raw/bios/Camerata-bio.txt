2) Camerata is a capella group. Their experiments with new forms and sounds make them totally different from other groups. The group comprises eight professional musicians, seven singers and a sound engineer. All of them have graduated from music academies in Belarus and Russia. Their home base is in Minsk, the capital city of Belarus. Camerataâ€™s repertoire includes pieces belonging to different genres, from classical and ethnic to jazz, often interwoven into each other, giving birth to totally new and uncommon combinations. The singers are sophisticated both in styles and voice timbres, artistically adapting each off them to a particular work. So when speaking about Camerata it is not enough to say that they have got a soprano, alto, tenor and bass. Each of the above is quite unexpectedly presented in their original compositions, combined with sound imitation, making them unique.
