Ethmebb is a symphonic progressive power metal band that make significant use of extreme metal in their sound. It's hugely bombastic, yet everything is heard clearly. They use different folk instruments like the accordion and bagpipes as well and they hop all over the place in terms of genre. They're crazy technical, yet clever through-composed songwriting makes them sound tight AF. It's almost as if Alestorm had a baby with Fleshgod Apocalypse and Symphony X.
