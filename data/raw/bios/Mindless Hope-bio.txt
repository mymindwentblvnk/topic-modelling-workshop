Mindless Hope
 

Mindless Hope is an American progressive metal band from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Formed in 2009, the band's debut album Verbatim was released in 2013. The second album, 2016's Unlocking A New Realm Of Existence, was released with an almost entirely new lineup. The band comprises of vocalist Mark David, guitarists Matthew Grosse and Robert Covello, bassist Frank Neill, and drummer Travis Ebner. Grosse is the only remaining founding member.

 

Formation and Verbatim (2009-2013)
 

Mindless Hope was founded in Morrisville, Pennsylvania, in August 2009 by guitarists Matthew Grosse and James Rivera, and bassist Tom Dilliplane as an instrumental progressive metal band. They later recruited William Lohr as a drummer and Justin Brown as a third guitarist. The band recorded and released their debut, Verbatim in May 2013.

 

Unlocking A New Realm Of Existence (2014-2017)
 

Shortly after the release of Verbatim, Brown and Rivera left the band. Directly afterwards, Lohr was let go from the band. Peter Romero Jr. then joined the band as a guitarist in the autumn of 2013. Mark David and Dave Elliott III were next brought in as dual vocalists. Next, Robert Covello was brought in as a guitarist. In 2014, Dilliplane quit the band. The bass position was then filled by Roger Haff. The new lineup began working on a new album while searching for a new drummer. The search ended in late 2015 when Travis Ebner stunned the rest of the band during a tryout.

With a new lineup, Grosse was able to finish production of the band's second LP, entitled Unlocking A New Realm Of Existence, released in October 28, 2016.

 
Speechless EP and Mental Truancy (2017-present)
 

After releasing Unlocking A New Realm Of Existence, the band began planning and recording Speechless EP, an EP with songs from the instrumental Verbatim, redone with lyrics, new leads by Rob Covello, remixed, and remastered. In 2018, the band began writing for their new full-length LP. They are currently looking to fill the third guitarist spot but is continuing on as a 5 piece with two guitars.

On August 10, 2018, Dave Elliott III left the band for personal reasons.
In September, 2018, Roger Haff was let go from the band.

In November 2019, James Rivera rejoined the band after a 4-year hiatus from music. Unfortunately, he was shot and killed by a stray bullet while walking home from a concert in Northeast Philadelphia on December 21, 2019. This was a huge blow to the band.

November 29,2020, Frank Neill was announced as the band's new bassist.

June 18th, 2022, the band released the first single from their third album, Mental Truancy, entitled "Paradigm". The video has garnered over five thousand views on Youtube in the first 3 months. 

Mindless Hope signed a record deal with Sliptrick Records for the release of their third album, Mental Truancy in the summer of 2022.

September 23, 2022, Mental Truancy is released digitally worldwide, as well as the second single from the new album, "A Bleak Scenario" with a music video accompaniment. 




Musical style
 

The band originally started as an instrumental progressive metal band, but after 2014, included vocals. The band's music contains elements of thrash and melodic death metal, as well as metalcore, but is primarily progressive metal. Some vocals have harmonies, solo clean singing, and hard metal vocals. The band started with three guitarists and still makes songs that have multi-part harmonies.

The songs vary in tuning, with some using a standard tuning, some using seven strings, as well as a variety of others.
