Mastercastle is an Italian heavy metal band. The band was founded by italian guitarist, Pier Gonella (also Labyrinth Necrodeath) together with the vocalist  Giorgia Gueglio to the scene. The guitar work of Pier is sure to please fans of the likes of Yngwie Malmsteen, with its strong riffs and explosive lead work. Giorgia Gueglio vocals are equal to task of matching Gonella’s guitar work with their great power and soaring qualities and also serve in giving Mastercastle their own unique sound. Mastercastle are completed by the rhythm section of bassist  Steve Vawamas and guest drummer  Alessandro Bissa  aka Bix (Vision Divine) who combine to create a solid backdrop for all tracks.

Mastercastle were born in January 2008 by Pier Gonella and Giorgia Gueglio. The pair had had several music projects in the past and wanted to try something different. No fixed genre was chosen with the emphasis being on producing music in a natural way. The pair wrote a number of songs and then chose 4 to record for a promo to gain label interest. The first musician contacted to help complete the demo was drummer Alessandro Bissa. Having worked in the past with Pier and Giorgia, Bix’s arrival changed the initial project into a real band. The line up was completed by Steve Vawamas on bass guitar and the name Mastercastle was settled on for the new band who went on to complete the recordings of the four song demo.

On July 2008 they sent those four tracks to Lion Music, later signing with them. Mastercastle’s debut album “The Phoenix” is due on April 17 2009.
