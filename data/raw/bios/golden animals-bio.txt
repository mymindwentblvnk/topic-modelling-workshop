Golden Animals are a desert rock band influenced primarily by Depression-Era blues, psychedelic 60’s rock and the mystical music of desert-lands from afar. Golden Animals seek to find and explore new territories within the American, two-piece compendium and see freedom as the objective of their life and music.

First coming together in Brooklyn in 2006, the duo found themselves increasingly dissatisfied with high-rent and urban distractions present in modern-day New York and found themselves longing for a drastically different reality. They saved up and traveled west, seeking isolation, space, peace and freedom from the trappings the modern city climate holds for artists.

Since landing in CA's low desert in ’07, GA have lead a nomadic lifestyle throughout the vast California desert finding temporary, remote locations to write and rehearse their music. They are currently completing the writing of their 2nd LP and are performing much of their new material in their live shows. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Golden+Animals">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
