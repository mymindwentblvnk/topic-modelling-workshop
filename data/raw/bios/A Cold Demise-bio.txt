A Cold Demise is a black metal band with an ambient attitude from Rabat, Morocco and was founded in January 2007 by Mustapha (vocals, bass, lyrics), Jamal (drums), and Ritab (guitar). The first rehearsal was recorded in April 2007 which unfortunately was never released due to bad conditions. In the same year, the band stopped playing because of many problems. Jamal was incarcerated and Ritab became addicted to drugs. After a long silence, A Cold Demise exploded with a new demo which was recorded during the fall of 2009 entitled "Restless Soul" with Mustapha and Jamal and this time with Amine (guitar, synths). This demo refers to their miserable life and presents sounds of misanthropy, despair, love for nature, solitude, melancholy, pain, emptiness, pessimism, and a breath of heartache.
