The band took shape in 1992 based on the apogee that death metal had in the time, in Mexicali(MÃ©xico) this band is the pioneer of that genre. The name of the band come of the search of words with meanings referents to death metal, being that "nex necis" in latin means "Violent death by mutilation or butchery", so the name was simplified to Necis that would mean "Violent Death By Mutilation".
 
After years of playing cover songs of bands like Sepultura, Grave, Benediction, Napalm Death, Celtic Frost, Slayer, Unleashed, Hipocrisy, Asphix, Bolt Thrower, Eternal Solstice, Deicide, Cannibal Corpse, Brujeria, Morbid Angel and others, the band created music of their own of what now only home recordings remain. 

There has been several lineup changes since the band started, nonetheless the Necis concept stands strong.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Necis">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
