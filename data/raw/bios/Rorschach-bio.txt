Rorschach is a metalcore band from New Jersey, United States, that existed from 1989 to 1993 and again from 2009 to 2012. Their blend of hardcore with dissonant extreme metal had influenced many later hardcore, powerviolence, and metalcore bands.

The first release by the band, Remain Sedate, shows the band's sound at a stage when they played fast, dissonant metalcore with raspy vocals. As the band progressed, they developed a slower, more sludge style sound that was influenced by New York band Swans. Vocals evolved into high-pitched screaming instead of shouting, due in part to voice problems Maggio was experiencing at the time. This change in sound can be heard on their second album, Protestant. Shortly after, the group disbanded, some members joining Deadguy and Kiss It Goodbye.

Rorschach has performed occasional reunion shows from 2009 through 2012. Decibel magazine inducted Protestant into their Hall of Fame. Rorschach's song "Pavlov's Dogs" is depicted in the 2012 film Zero Dark Thirty. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rorschach">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
