A man of multiple activities and genres, long-time DJ/producer Todd Osborn (no "e", mind you) uses a variety of aliases to express himself in a manner very similar to close friend and co-conspirator Tadd Mullnix. As the proprietor of the legendary Dubplate Pressure record store in Ann Arbor (where Sam Valenti IV met Tadd Mullinix), Osborn has occupied an important place in the local Ann Arbor scene, also running the ragga jungle label, Rewind!, and holding events throughout the Detroit area.

As a musician, Todd occupies his small studio (based quite literally in his closet) and produces old school-inspired jungle as Soundmurderer with Mullinix (as SK-1) for Rewind!, Violent Turd (the Tigerbeat6 offshoot), and Richard D. James's Rephlex label. He also produces booty with Brian Gillespie for Databass as Starski and Clutch.

Under his four-to-the-floor alias, Osborne, Todd creates classic house and techno for Ghostly's Spectral Sound imprint. Occupying the space between jacking acid techno and piano-led house, Todd broke through with his "'Bout Ready to Jak" single which got club play from numerous DJs including Richie Hawtin. His follow-up, Daylight, was released on 12" and also featured on Idol Tryouts: Ghostly Internation Vol. I. After a 12" of Bout Ready to Jak Remixes, Osborne released his most unique track yet on the Afrika EP <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Osborne">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
