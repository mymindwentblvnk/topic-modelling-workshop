Of Dreams and Madness is an unsigned band from Plainfield, CT and can be described as a spider; spinning a web of emotions and philosophies with its music. But the spinnerets of this hard-rock (light-metal) band produce more than just a sticky discharge that catches flies; these guys have bigger prey in mind.  ODAM is a fun and entertaining band with a wide appeal, and – refreshingly – has maintained its artistic integrity by creating a unique and expressive musical experience. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Of+Dreams+and+Madness">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
