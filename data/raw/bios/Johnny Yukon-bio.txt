Over a smoked-out m√©lange of R&B, abstract pop, and hip-hop, Pennsylvania-born and Los Angeles-based singer-songwriter-producer Johnny Yukon threads together an all-encompassing experience. Through grainy visuals captured on Super 8 film and fashion-forward stills rooted in vintage, yet modern panache, Yukon upholds consistent cinematic motifs across sound and style. His world draws as much from Kubrickian attention to detail and Christopher Nolan-style scope as it does from unpredictable production and hazy melodicism. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Johnny+Yukon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
