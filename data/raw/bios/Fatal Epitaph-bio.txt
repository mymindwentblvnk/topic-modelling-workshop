Originally formed in 1988 as Reanimator (and splitting up a year later), Fatal Epitaph, hailing from Vinnytsya, Ukraine and one of the few deathgrinds act of their country at the time, saw life in 1992 with the release of the demo Possessed By Death, a year later after they had reformed. In 1993 they released another demo, Melodies For The Insanity and in 1995 it was Another Side Of Reality, also a demo. A full-lenght, Misanthropy, finally came out in 1997 through Izmira Productions, as a cassette. It was re-released in 2000 by Terroraiser Productions. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fatal+Epitaph">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
