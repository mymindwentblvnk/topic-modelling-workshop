A Polish deathgrind band from Gliwice/BÄ™dzin formed in 1987 as Schismopathic Torment. A year later they dropped the "Torment" and the next year they (May 20) recorded then released tape named "Kharkharamapathic Regurgitator". In 1990 they recorded an album named D.E.M.O.C.R.A.C.Y. but it remained unreleased. Split-up in 1991.

A posthumous compilation was released via Please Release Records, in December 2013, containing both studio material, previously mentioned, and live tracks. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Schismopathic">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
