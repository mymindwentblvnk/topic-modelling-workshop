Crossover/Thrash from San Diego, CA, USA.

5 guys who rage and want to have a good time and entertain the shit out of people with each performance. We love thrash, we love metal, we love punk, we love hardcore but hate the majority of hardcore douchebags, wanna be toughguys, bitch ass white belt scenesters and anyone who takes themselves seriously. Our band motto is "Friends playing for Friends" so if you live in San Diego, come on out to hang out. If youre not from SD, move here. We at the moment dont have a label, both full lengths have been self released, the 7" self released the DVD is also self released. Both videos were self, shot and edited with absolutely zero budget. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/PC+Death+Squad">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
