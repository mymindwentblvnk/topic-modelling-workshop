Shadowcraft was formed in August 2005 by Pyrphoros (vocals) and Amethyst (Lead Guitars) The band managed to release 2 demos (A Nigh tfull Of Shadows and Inside A Sick Mind) gathering encouraging reviews from the local audience.

The arrival of Q_Snc (keyboards and orchestrations for Unholy Ritual , Kawir ,Daylight Misery and others) helped expanding the band’s musical horizons – something which was seen with the Promo 2009. Following this release , Shadowcraft composed and recorded the material for the debut album “Principles Of Chaos”

Shadowcraft’s style is a mix of majestic and symphonic elements structured with avant-garde black metal riffing. Epic and dramatic , the compositions drift between emotions crystalizing into the essence of atmospheric yet extreme present-day black metal.
