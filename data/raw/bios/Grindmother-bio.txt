Grindmother began in Jan 2015 after a video of her guest recording session with her son Rainforest went viral.  The pair later released a video for an original song called "Any Cost", which famously earned a tweet from Ozzy Osbourne.  Drummer Tyson Blast was added to the group in Jan 2016 and the trio recorded their debut album, "Age of Destruction".  Later in 2016, Grindmother joined the Continental Concerts USA roster followed by the addition of live guitarist, Dan Yee.  Concert dates for several cities have already been announced, and the band intends to tour throughout 2017.  Recently, Grindmother was interviewed by CTV News after a band rehearsal video exploded with 1.5 million views, via their Facebook page. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Grindmother">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
