With influences ranging from Talking Heads to Tame Impala, The Tins craft masterfully layered jams that USA Today calls “brilliant pop exuberance.”  Hailing from Buffalo NY, the trio has released a number of critically acclaimed records.  The Tins’ first single, “The Green Room,” was chosen by Sean Parker, Spotify creator, as a staple of his Hipster International Playlist, and tapped as Spotify Staff Picks #2 Song of the Year.  Since that point the Tins have worked with producers Joe Blaney (Modest Mouse, Prince, The Clash) and Ted Young (Kurt Vile, The Gaslight Anthem) and have garnered millions of plays online. The Tins are currently in rotation on SiriusXM Radio and have been licensed to several hit TV shows including Beverly Hills 90210 and Roadtrip Nation.

Since moving to the Queen City in 2010, The Tins have steadily climbed the ladder of local notoriety, consistently playing to sold out crowds all around Western New York. Along the way, they crossed paths with Robby Takac of the Goo Goo Dolls. Impressed by their previous work, Takac agreed to come on as producer of their latest record. The resulting full length album is their boldest, most powerfully enchanting undertaking yet, impressive enough to have caught the ear of world renowned painter Philip Burke, (Rolling Stone, Time, The New Yorker). Burke offered to create the self-titled record's eye catching artwork. The amount of local support surrounding this record has created a truly special, communal feel, a culmination of sorts to this phase of the band's career. Entertainment blogger Will Oliver writes "The Tins are destined for greatness," and with this release, they may have finally reached it.
