Since their debut with catchy single Human early 2016 things have moved steady for Stockholm psych pop act Melby. In May 2017, the quartet released their self-titled debut EP via Stockholm label Rama Lama Records. The EP featured singles Cross and Pat, both receiving great response from Swedish and international sources such as Amazing Radio and Line of Best Fit, with the latter calling Cross "otherworldly, and wholly brilliant". 

The band often gets comparison to fellow swedes Dungen and Amason but Melby’s dynamic sound, with influences from folk, psych, indie and pop, stand out. The quartets light, semi-psychedelic folk pop is led by Matilda Wiezell’s enchanting voice which fits perfectly with Melby’s unique musical landscape. The band consists of Wiezell, Are Engen Steinsholm (guitar), David Jehrlander (bass) and Teo Jehrlander (drums) and formed when living together in a Stockholm shared housing.

Melby are currently in the studio working on fresh material to follow up their debut EP.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Melby">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
