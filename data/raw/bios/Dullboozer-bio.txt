Dullboozer was born in 2010 as Reaction, a project engaged by Pepo and AxEL with Serra and former bassist Ricard. In the beginning, Javi played the keyboard, but soon he left the band as it begun to be more and more thrasher. Because of a crisis between AxEL and Pepo, Dami√† entered the band as the new drummer and stayed for a year and a half. Even though the band never really quit playing, it remained a bit inactive.
Through the years it has been active it had lots of names until in winter, 2012, the band started to merge as Dullboozer with a will to record the songs that were composed during all that time. Then, because of stress and not related problems, Ricard quit on bassist duty, and Albert tried to play with the band, but left after some months. It was then when Marc entered the band as the growler and bassist and recordings restarted. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dullboozer">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
