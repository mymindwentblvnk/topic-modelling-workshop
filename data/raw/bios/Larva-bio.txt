Biography:
[*] 1) Spanish Dark Electro band.  The project was born on the 1998, by the hand of InqUesT and Blackend with the name ‘Morbid Mind’. On the year 2003 already in solitary and with renewed forces InqUesT gives a new course to the project it changing name (now 'Larva'). Due to the technical, social and ideological change of the formation. Now more involved in social topics and with a more powerful sound; more noises and hardness, without losing an alone apex of his darkness. In the beginning of the 2006 the formation had enriched by the contribution of two more members (M.L. and Anoxia); what provides to his compositions of major diversity, and the live shows of more energy. Voces del laberinto will include two videos as a bonus tracks and has been masterized by Jan (X-Fusion, Noisuf-X).

Final release of Advoxya in 2008 – the album „Voces Del Laberinto" from Spanish band LARVA. Band exists from 1998 and already has several albums, released by its own force or within the short-live deals with other labels. The cold adjusted sound directs associations with the visual row of the classical horror movies, fast enough and supplied with slow, forcing the gloomy atmosphere sonic sculptures, album should be listened due one breathe. It carries along the listener into the world of fear and endlessness, reflecting the common panic of the surrounding world. Must-have category for all fans of traditional electronic body music!
