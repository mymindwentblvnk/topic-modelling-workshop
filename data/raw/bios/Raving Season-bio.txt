The first "season" of the project Raving Season dates from the winter of 2005, being born from the meeting of the two singers Judith and Federica with guitarist Sergio. The idea was to start a mostly doom-death band which was also open to various influences, especially to the creativity of each component. After three years the band found its own sound, thanks to the new entries Marco at guitars, who's going to become co-composer of songs along with Sergio, and two temporay session elements at drum and bass. The sound of the band can now finally come out, enriched by improved growl and lyrical vocals, as well as keyboards, played by Judith, and after few months the Ep is ready to be recorded in May 2009 at Early Reflection Studios in Rome.

In Autumn 2009 the band finally accepts three new members ; Paolo (Bass), Laura (keyboards), Stefano (Drums), line up is completed and ready for live performances and to work together on new ideas.

After 2 years of work the new album is ready.
