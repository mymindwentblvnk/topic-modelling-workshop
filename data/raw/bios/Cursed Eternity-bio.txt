Cursed Eternity is a Heavy Metal band formed in 1994 in the outskirts of Detroit, Michigan USA. Cursed Eternity went through many minor and major evolutions between 1994 and 1999 when they finally settled on an official band name and moved their base of operations to Lansing, Michigan. With influences ranging from Black Metal to 80’s hair bands the band’s sound eventually evolved into an aggressive form of speed metal with elements from thrash and death metal. Though not intending on being an official LP many consider the bands self titled EP their first LP, (and only) release. The Cursed Eternity EP eventually sold out the initial 1000 print pressing before the bands demise in 2008...

Cursed Eternity's main songwriter and frontman Joe Cady is in the process of reforming the band for 2011. "I've given it three years and have tried my hand at other projects. This band is and always will be my baby and I can't wait to see it alive and breathing again!" "Though I don't know how active we will be, I am planning on an official full length and going to make plans from there. So we'll see what happens!"  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cursed+Eternity">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
