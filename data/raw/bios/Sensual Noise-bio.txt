Sensual Noise (www.sensualnoise.be) is an Experimental and Atmospheric Downtempo band, that stands for an original collaboration of an eclectic variety of influences, coming from Belgium. We go for a creative approach to contemporary Atmospheric music. 

Think in terms of layers and intensity, contemplation and outbursts of frantic enthausiasm, supported by 2 guitars and 2 bassplayers providing a spacious sound filled up with low-end heaviness. As a band and lyric-wise, we stand for evolution and movement. We stand for a d.i.y approach and we reject the "cool" attitude that depends on the musical fashion of today. 

Since David joined us as a second bassplayer we played around +60 shows, among them at an abandoned stone factory, on the beach and at the lappersfort forest occupation. 
We did mini-tours with Corova and Downfall of Gaia through Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands. We shared stages as well with bands as Kylesa, Rosetta, Amen ra, Bossk, Ef, Tephra, Overmars, Jakuziâ€™s attempt, Alpinist, Time to burn, .Maudlin, Do androids dream of electric sheep and many more...
