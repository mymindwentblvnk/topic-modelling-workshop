Grand Master is a progressive metal band hailing from Winnipeg, Manitoba. Headed by Alec Schaefer on bass and vocals, Shane Barron on guitars, and Matt Kathler on drums and percussion, Grand Master is making a name for themselves by showing versatility through metal music.

Starting in November of 2007, and playing their first show in January 2008, they have played many shows since then, both heavy and acoustic. After a successful release of their debut independent EP "Omen" in April of 2009, Grand Master is progressing and writing new material for a full length album and a cross county tour. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Grand+Master">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
