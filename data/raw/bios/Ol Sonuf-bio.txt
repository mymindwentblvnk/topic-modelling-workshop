Jason Aaron Wood, Guitarist of Todesbonden, and Founder, Composer, and Guitarist for Ol Sonuf. 

Based in the Washington, DC area, US-born guitarist Jason Aaron Wood gives the listener a glimpse of many facets of his musicianship, ranging from purely symphonic orchestral arrangements to blues-infused rock, from unrelenting extreme metal & crushing doom to experimental electronic, from neoclassical shred to acoustic fusion.
In addition to his recordings on traditional media (CD), Jason's music has also been featured in the 2010 National Lampoon film "The Legend of Awesomest Maximus."

Following the success of his band Todesbonden's 2008 release "Sleep Now, Quiet Forest" (Prophecy Productions), along with several well-received performances, Jason released the first of his solo CDs, the acoustic EP "Reflections," on Halloween 2012.

Following in the same Halloween-album-release tradition, Jason has most recently released the debut LP for his iconoclastic one-man extreme metal band Ol Sonuf, entitled "Glass Idols," on Halloween 2013, featuring guest female vocals by multiple-Global-Music-Award-winning vocalist, Todesbonden bandmate, and Jason's wife, Laurie Ann Haus. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ol+Sonuf">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
