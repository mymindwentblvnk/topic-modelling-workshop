A Cloud Mireya is a project between Claudia Deheza (ex- ON!AIR!LIBRARY!) + Guillermo S. Herren (Prefuse 73, Savath y Savalas, Piano Overlord, Zanzo, and other d.l. solo projects, plus the defunct: Delarosa+Asora.) They've recorded songs together for over two years, threw some away, kept some, loved some and hated some. They both write and play all the songs themselves unless they're in desperate need of help. It's a good blend of where they both are coming from musically. They've been super slow about putting it out due to their other projects but they don't consider this a side project since they've been at it for a minute.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/A+Cloud+Mireya">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
