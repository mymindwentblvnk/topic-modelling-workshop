Soul Control is a punk band from Providence, RI that formed in 2006. The band released a demo in early 2007 as well as a split EP on Eightfold Path Records before signing to Rivalry Records. Two EPs, Soul Control and Involution, were released in 2007 and the band embarked on multiple US tours as well as a tour of Europe/UK. In 2008 they released a series of four one sided vinyl singles on Triple B Records, Dead But Dreaming Records, TDB Records and Copper Lung Records respectively. The covers of  "Four Singles" came together to form one larger image. After the singles were released they returned to a heavy touring schedule that included multiple trips throughout the USA and Canada as well as a week long tour of Central America.  In early 2009 the band signed to Bridge 9 Records. They released their first full length LP, Cycles, that same year and toured the USA and Europe. 2010 was the first year of the bands existence in which no new material was released and they also employed a lighter touring schedule. An EP entitled "Get Out Now" was released in 2011 and soon after the band returned to Europe for a third time. The band laid low until the summer of 2012 when they released another EP on Bridge 9 entitled "Bore Core."  A fourth European trek alongside Verse and Ritual, a third appearance at The Fest in Gainesville and a one off California show followed the release of the EP.
