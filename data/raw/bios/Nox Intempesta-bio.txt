Back in shades of 1994 Mordra and Tyrann, who were close friends by 1990 playing in the same band at that time, decided to put their own music up to satisfy their spirit, flesh and bones, as their taste of brutal music and the temptation for the occult went similar ways just after they started playing seperately in different bands. So they chose the way of the darkest night and founded NOX INTEMPESTA as a two-piece having Mordra and Tyrann sharing guitars/vocals/bass and Tyrann playing drums while Mordra did all of the keyboards. The music they wanted to come up with had to be the purest BLACK METAL.

In this line up they recorded their first and only two demos „A GRIM RED KISS OF TRANSYLVANIA„ and „MAJESTIC SCARLET NOVA„ in that same year. NOX INTEMPESTA was offered a deal over two MCDs and one full - length – album. „DIE LIEDER VON TOD UND EWIGKEIT„ was the first official release to come up that same year. But as far as NOX INTEMPESTA came with „DIE LIEDER......„ they recognized it was as far as they could get as a two-piece, because live appearences were impossible to realize. As new material was already written the next step was obviously to complete the line-up for live mayhem. The first one to join was drummer Holocaust after one audition that at the same time brought up his pseudonym. Closely to the upcoming recording sessions bass player Monastiir joined in and the still current line-up was completed. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nox+Intempesta">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
