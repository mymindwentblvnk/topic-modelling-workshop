As the key members of pioneering early-'90s West Coast gangsta group South Central Cartel, Havoc Prodeje broke away and recorded some equally notable albums as a duo throughout the '90s, beginning with 1993's Livin' in a Crime Wave. Next came Kickin' Game in early 1995, also released on Quality Records, followed by Truez Neva Stop in 1997. Unfortunately, the duo's career never rivaled South Central Cartel's. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Havoc+&+Prodeje">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
