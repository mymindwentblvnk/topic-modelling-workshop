Digga D has positioned himself as the forefront of UK rap through an unblemished ability to step away from the rigid blueprint of drill music to inject an infections element of versatility into every single release. Hailing from Ladbroke Grove in West London, Digga D speaks to the gritty realities of inner city youth while maintaining an air of wit and creativity across his catalogue. With a slew of classics behind him, like No Hook, Who? and No Diet. As well as a host of unforgettable appearances on freestyle platforms, such as Next Up?, Mad About Bars and most recently Daily Duppy (which currently sits at 8.8M views.) The future is Digga D’s.

Following on from a string of successful single releases, Digga gears up for his highly anticipated second mixtape titled ‘Made In The Pyrex’. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Digga+D">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
