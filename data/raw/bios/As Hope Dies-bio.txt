As Hope Dies was a melodic death metal/melodic metalcore band out of Orange County, California. They are very influenced by the Swedish death metal act At The Gates, except they do not have guitar solos in their songs, yet instead focus heavily on harmonized riffs. The band broke up after their 2003 release, but announced in August of 2004 that they had reformed. They released a self-titled EP in 2005, only to split up again.
