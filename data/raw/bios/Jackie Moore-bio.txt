Jackie Moore (Jacksonville, Florida, 1946 - November 8, 2019) was an American R&B singer. She is best known for her gold single 1970 song "Precious, Precious," which reached #30 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart on March 6, 1971. This disc sold over one million copies, and received a gold disc awarded by the R.I.A.A. in March 1971.

Also noteworthy was her 1979 disco hit "This Time Baby," which hit #1 on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. The track reached #49 in the UK Singles Chart. The latter would later be sampled for the 2005 dance radio and club hit "Love on My Mind" by the Freemasons featuring Amanda Wilson. Moore also had a pop chart hit (#42) with Bunny Sigler and Phil Hurtt's upbeat "Sweet Charlie Babe" in the fall of 1973, which she recorded with the Philadelphia Strings and Horns.

Reviewing the 1973 Sweet Charlie Babe LP, Robert Christgau wrote in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981), "Figures that this should fall somewhere between state-of-the-art and great-mean soul: the five hits go back to 'Precious, Precious' in the winter of '71, with the two latest cut at a funkier-than-usual Sigma in Philadelphia and the others by a simpler-than-usual Crawford-Shapiro team at Criteria in Miami. Moore's voice is simultaneously sweet and rough, an unusual combination in a woman, and the songs are pretty consistent. But she lacks not only persona but personality, so that what in technical terms is pretty impressive stuff never goes over the top."

"This Time Baby" was a featured song in the video game, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories.
