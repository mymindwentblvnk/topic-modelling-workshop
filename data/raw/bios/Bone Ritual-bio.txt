Bone Ritual started as a solo band of Strep Cunt (Witch Tomb, Cryostasium) in 2007.  At that time only rough drum-machine demos were recorded which will never be released.  In 2009, Baron Von Gonkulator (Gonkulator) was recruited for drums, and the first demo was released June 23, 2009.  A pro-pressed tape release of this demo was done by Bestial Burst, limited to 100 copies. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bone+Ritual">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
