Murder Cafe is a 3 piece metal act that was born out of the split of Boat to Morocco in 2010. They started by playing mostly lounge inspired improv metal, but soon drifted to a more experimental doom flavor. They are currently signed to To The Head Records, which is owned by front-man, Kyle Davis.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Murder+Cafe">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
