Orias was originally the soloproject of Anton Berlin, but later developed to be a band, with Anton as main composer. Orias was formed in 2003, in Sweden. The band plays orchestral metal. Based on the vision of Anton, it unites hollywood music orchestration with metal elements. The first demo album is avaible at www.orias.se. Soon, a full album will be released with vocals and narration. The release date was set to october the 15th, 2007. But because of some difficulties of getting the bed tracks of the music to the singer in the US, the release date is now set to december the 15th, 2007.
