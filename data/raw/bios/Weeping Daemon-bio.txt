The story of Weeping Daemon began in fall 2004 in Laitila, Finland,
when brothers Kettunen decided to form a melodic metal
band to counterpoise for another group. The brothers looked
for some players near Laitila and in just a few months
the band was in shape to play the kind of music they wanted.

The first line-up was Johannes on vocals/bass, Joonas and Riku on guitars and Mikko ..s with Rami slamming on the drums.
Back then the band was called "Northern Lights", and after a couple of cover gigs they started producing their own vision of melodic metal.

In 2006 Riku met Oskari in the army. That meeting ultimately resulted
in Oskari moving behind the keys and Mikko taking up the bass,
giving Johannes the chance to fully concentrate on his singing.
With the last pieces set in the puzzle, the band began to sound better than ever. The name was changed to "Weeping Daemon" and the guys started heating up the iron.

The first demo/promo release, called "My Dreams... My Nightmares...", was released in December 2007 after many obstacles were eventually overcome. The first lessons have now been learned, and the upcoming demo CD "Scars In My Heart" will be released in January or February 2009.

Currently the guys are rehearsing new songs and promoting their band,
taking part in as many gigs as possible. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Weeping+Daemon">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
