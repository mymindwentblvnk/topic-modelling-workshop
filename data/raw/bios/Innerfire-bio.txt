Even though the band has its roots in the late 90's, the story of INNERFIRE really began in 2002, when Florian Lysy (keys) and former guitar player Alin Petrut (from Romanian Metal band GOTHIC) first met.  With the help of a session drummer, Oliver Lespagnard (ex-DRAGDOWN, SPLEEN), they recorded a 2 track demo, "Destiny Of Blood". 

Refusing to play live with session members, the duet took on new members to fill the line up.  So Fred Gayda (bass,MIND PROCESSION), Patrick Di Venti (guitar, ex-MYSTICA), Phil Gustin (drums, PESTIFER) and Dahl (vocals, AblaZine, ex-DRAGDOWN) joined the band, really giving birth to INNERFIRE.  With this line-up, the band self-produced its first CD, "In Blood We Trust", released on Painkiller Records in 2004. 

For many reasons, Alin Petrut left the band right after the release of the CD.  He was soon replaced by Arnaud Vaneukem (ex-ALESIA).  Arnaud really gave a new blood to the band, and in November 2005, INNERFIRE entered Jonathas Studio, in Enghien (B), to record a new EP, "My Lycan Me".  Recorded and produced by Jérémie "Phorgath" Bézier (EMPTINESS, ENTHRONED) and Xavier Carion (CHANNEL ZERO, SUMO, SONS OF JONATHAS) and mastered by Attie Bauw (SCORPIONs, etc), this EP showing the real musical identity of the band was released on Painkiller Records early 2006. 

After replacing Fred Gayda by Adrien Gustin (PESTIFER), the next big step for INNERFIRE was the recording of a new album.  This happened in May 2007 in the famous Berno Studio, in Malmö (S) with legendary producer Berno Paulsson (AMON AMARTH, THE HAUNTED, DEFLESHED...). 

Named "Of Legends & Allegiance", this album is released by Painkiller Records during Spring 2008.  Right after the release, things started to move on for the band: new bookings, new management, new live shows... and new members.  Decided to focus more on their own PESTIFER, the evil twins, Adrien and Phil, left INNERFIRE.  Fortunately, Alex (ex-CURSE) and Laurent (ex-MYSTICA, ACKROS) soon filled the vacancies...
