In 2017, she released her debut single, "Weather," and its blunt, confrontational, and endlessly confident delivery quickly caught the attention of many listeners. She followed up with several other singles and, in late 2018, her debut mixtape, That's Just the Bottom Line.

The following year saw the release of the singles "Hey Lightskin" and "Atlanta," the latter of which featured Stevie B. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/LightSkinKeisha">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
