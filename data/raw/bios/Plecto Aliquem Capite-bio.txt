Pain knows no boundaries nor does it restrict itself, the same can be said about the music made by Sri Lanka`s Plecto Aliquem Capite. A band that evolves and experiments in order to capture the true essence of pain and suffering in their music.

"The tracks from Plecto Aliquem Capite take all they do to the limit, their creations a nightmarish maelstrom of sound."  - ringmaster reviews-

"The strange thing is that all these effects create a rather bizarre/twisted atmosphere that if one is open-minded enough, he’ll appreciate it since it fits to the music." -metalkaoz.com-  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Plecto+Aliquem+Capite">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
