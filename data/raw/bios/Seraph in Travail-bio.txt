Seraph in Travail was conceived in 2008 by vocalist Jonathan Sutherland and guitarist Joe Bonner - two musicians who found that they shared the common goal of creating epic soundscapes with the perfect balance of intensity and musicality. In its embryonic stages, the project saw countless musicians come and go - each lineup stronger than the last, but ultimately unable to achieve the founding members' creative vision. These darker times still yielded plenty of hope, allowing the pair to further refine their sound and improve their skill while in search of like-minded musicians.

2012 saw the arrival of guitarist Tim Carey, who stuck with the band through another slew of line-up changes. Drummer Tom Kapral (ex. Decaysia) took the throne in late 2014, and shortly after, the band decided it was time to share their music with the world.

2015 marks the release of the band's first full-length album, Bring Forth Death. The record sees their vision truly coming to life for the first time - a melodic but fundamentally death metal sound, met with hints of gothic and black metal aesthetic. Technical, arpeggiated guitar riffs and haunting harmonies are supported by tastefully ferocious drumming, all interwoven with the mournful sounds of choir, strings, and piano. Sutherland's vicious screams and gutteral lows, complimented at times by clean vocals ranging from low stabs to soaring highs, further solidify the sound as unique and original, but familiar to those who appreciate the style.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Seraph+in+Travail">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
