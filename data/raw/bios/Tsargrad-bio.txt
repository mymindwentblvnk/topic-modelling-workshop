Tsargrad is a power metal band formed in Toronto, ON in 2012.

Born from steel and thunder, Tsargrad is the vision come to life from Conor Filipuzzi, and Glenn Marchildon.

In summer of 2012 Glenn and Conor decided to part ways with their current band, and create something that is true to what they believed in musically... a powerful simple metal, that told the story of the past through instruments of the present. After writing several songs, Glenn contacted old friends and band mates to see if anyone was interested. Chris Galbraith (drums) and Zak Field (bass) loved the idea, and quickly signed up. After writing several more songs, and getting tight as a band, Tsargrad was born. They played their first show to a packed house at the hard Rock Cafe in Toronto, and were very well recieved.

In their short amount of time as a band they have been able to win a battle of the bands in Newmarket supporting cancer research, record an E.P titled "Axes High" and open for international touring acts such as Sevens Kingdoms (USA) and Arkona (RUS) with rave reviews.

Blending powerful rhythm, heavy hitting drums, blinding guitars solos and lyrics that tell the stories of battles past is what Tsargrad brings to the stage night after night. And you can expect to hear more, as Tsargrad is just getting started.
