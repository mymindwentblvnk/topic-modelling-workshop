The german Black Metal band Adversum was founded by S. when he wrote the first songs in 2014. After a rehearsal session with the drummer MDB the band was complete and the recordings of the debut album “In the sign of Satan” started at CKB-Recording Studio/Essen in spring 2015. 
All instruments were recorded by S. (vocals, all guitars, bass) and MDB (drums). The session member R. has added the synthesizers and G.S. has composed the dark ambient song “Incipit Khaos” exclusively for this album.
