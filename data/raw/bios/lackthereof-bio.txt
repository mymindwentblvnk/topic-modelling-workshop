Lackthereof is the solo project of Danny Seim, a founding member of the Portland, Oregon-based band Menomena. 

The first six Lackthereof albums were recorded at home between the years 1997-2003 and given out to Seim's friends on cassettes and CD-R's. In 2005, FILMguerrero released "Christian the Christian" (CTC), making it the first album in the Lackthereof discography to receive any sort of formal distribution.

Seim took Lackthereof to a live setting for the first time to support the release of CTC, recruiting his wife Holly, friend Tyler Poage, and married couple Kevin and Anita Robinson of the band Viva Voce. This lineup played one show at Portland's annual PDX Pop Now! Festival before disbanding.

The following year, Seim revived the project again, this time with the help of Holly, Matt Dabrowiak, and Paul Alcott of the band Dat'r. The foursome played the 2005 PDX Pop Now! Festival, as well as several other shows in Portland in 2005-2006.

Lackthereof's eighth full-length release is titled "My Haunted" and was recorded in 2007.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lackthereof">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
