Two Will Witness is a metal/death metal band from Long Island, New York. The band was formed by guitarist Gian and drummer Nick in August of 2004. Gian and Nick quickly acquired guitarist Tom, bassist Sean, and vocalist Vinny. Shortly after his entrance into the band, Sean left and pursued his musical talents elsewhere. After Seans Departure, Kenny Swany was added to the band. After playing many shows on Long Island the band recorded their first demo which containted three songs: Vexed, My Condolences, and Burying the Wretch. Soon after the recording of the demo the band headed into Killingsworth Studios in 2007 and recorded a 5 song EP. In July of 2008, Two Will Witness felt that drummer Nick was not into the band as much as he used to be. Due to this, the band acquired drummer Ayumi Inoue. Shortly after Ayumi's entrance into Two Will Witness, they added Lumpy Wojcik as their third guitarist and Jackson Burns as bassist. Lumpy, Ayumi, and Jackson are all from local metal band Figure Without Form. With three new members and a third guitarist, Two Will Witness sets out to play many shows in and out of state. They will be recording a new demo at Full Force Studios in August of 2008. Two Will Witness will be writing a full length album for the rest of 2008. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Two+Will+Witness">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
