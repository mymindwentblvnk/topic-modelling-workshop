Everything influences my life and my music. What is the point in existing if you don't take something from every situation, every sound, every moment.

In the ambient and electro world, the main artists that have caused major celebration in my brain are:- The Orb, Radio Massacre International, Orbital, Aphex Twin and Autechre. 

Comparisons have been made to the following in reviews or in my own mind:- Ulver; Aphex Twin; Ah-Cama Sotz; Future Sound of London; The Orb; Radio Massacre International; Pink Floyd; Orbital; Lull; Coil; Autechre; Sabres of Paradise; but the overall sound I think (and hope) is very unique.

There are plenty of reviews and snippets on the myspace page:-
