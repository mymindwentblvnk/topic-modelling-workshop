This group performed on Tuesday 8th May 2007 at The Toff in Town, Melbourne, Australia. It was a one-off improv performance the day before a Sunn O))) & Boris show.

In May of 2007 Sunn O))) embarked on a Pacific Rim tour that included performances in Australia and Japan. The line-up for this tour included the core Sunn O))) duo: Greg Anderson and Stephen O'Malley plus T.O.S. on Moog, Oren Ambarchi (analogue effects and supplemental guitar) and vocalist Attila Csihar. Upon arrival in Melbourne, Australia, Sunn O))) invited one of their favourite black metal artists: Sin Nanna of Striborg to collaborate with them during their show. This unholy meeting went over very well and the inaugural ritual was a warm-up gig at the Toft in Town club one evening before the larger gig at the Hi-Fi Bar (with brethren: Boris).

The results of this collaboration was a completely improvisational, vicious audio and visual assault on the sold out, standing room only audience! This was among the first time that Sunn O))) had worked with live drums and the outcome was completely unprecedented. The whole event was recorded live to 24-track/multi-track. Afterwards Oren Ambarchi edited, sequenced and overhauled the EQ to make it as brutal as possible. This blackened low-end psychedelic war is not for the faint of heart!

The CD was released limited to 3000 machine numbered copies. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pentemple">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
