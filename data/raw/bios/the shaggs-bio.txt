The Shaggs were an American all-female rock group formed in Fremont, New Hampshire, United States in 1968. The band was composed of sisters Dorothy "Dot" Wiggin (vocals/lead guitar), Betty Wiggin (vocals/rhythm guitar), Helen Wiggin (drums), and later Rachel Wiggin (bass). Today, they're known as a key part of the outsider music movement.

The band was formed by Dot, Betty, and Helen on the insistence of their father, Austin Wiggin, who believed that his mother foresaw their rise to stardom. The only studio album, 'Philosophy of the World', was released in 1969 and failed to garner attention, though the band continued to exist as a locally popular live act. The group disbanded in 1975 after the death of Austin.

The Shaggs have a consistent (but highly idiosyncratic) approach to melody, harmony, and rhythm. The songs use irregular verse structures, which are emphasized by the melodic structures. These typically accord one note per syllable: the guitar accompaniment attempts to reproduce this pattern as well. Most of the Shaggs material is made up of eighth- and quarter-notes.

Posthumously, the band gained notoriety and praise for their unconventional style, and lyrical honesty. Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain highlighted their work for praise. Frank Zappa named 'Philosophy of the World' one of his favorite records. He even said they were "better than The Beatles." 'Philosophy of the World' was later reissued on Rounder, the label of the rock group NRBQ, and the compilation 'Shaggs' Own Thing' was released in 1982.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Shaggs">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
