Artrosis formed in 1995 hail from Zielona Góra, Poland. Over the course of their career and eight studio albums, their sound has evolved from gothic and progressive metal to a more darkwave/industrial-oriented sound. The lyrics of the songs on the first albums were more fantasy-related, but within time, the style of the lyrics changed. Medeah started to write more about life experiences she and the whole band has been through.
