Epicenter is a Modern Thrash Metal band from Boston, MA / Pelham, NH with a distinctively different approach. They began in 2007 as a High School project, immediately devoting themselves to technical and creative proficiency. They soon made a name for themselves in the new England area. Slaying stages and crushing enthusiastic crowds at local venues, Epicenter takes the familiar Thrash sound and injects flavors of Jazz, Funk, Hardcore, Prog, and more to the mix. They have shared the stage with countless talented musicians and several monstrous national acts, and have no intentions of slowing down. The pure energy of Epicenterâ€™s stage show and the complex, heavy music they play leaves their crowds chanting for more. Witness it for yourself and feel the rush.
