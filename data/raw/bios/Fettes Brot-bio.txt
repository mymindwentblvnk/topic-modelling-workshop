Fettes Brot (german for "fat bread") is a German hip hop group founded in early 1992. Because the group is still around today they are sometimes refered to as "Hamburg's hip-hop-dinosaur".

History:
When the group Poets of Peeze disbanded in 1992, its members Doktor Renz (Martin Schrader, now Martin Vandreier) and Tobi Tobsen together with König Boris ("King Boris", Boris Lauterbach), Schiffmeister (Björn Warns) and Mighty founded Fettes Brot. The two Schmidt brothers, Tobi & Mighty, left early on to pursue other projects. The band's first album, the EP "Mitschnacker", was released by the remaining trio on Yo Mama Records. Prior to Mitschnacker the songs Schwarzbrot-Weißbrot ("Blackbread-Whitebread") and Schule der Gewalt ("School of violence") appeared on the sampler "Endzeit 93" from the Independent label Wilde Welt ("Wild World") Records.
