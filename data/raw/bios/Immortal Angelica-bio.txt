Immortal Angelica is a band from Jyväskylä, Finland consisting of 5 members.

The music of Immortal Angelica is a unique blend of several distinct styles, including heavy metal, Celtic and cinematic influences. This wide-ranging mélange of sound creates an atmosphere which could be described as emotional, melodic and, more than anything, diverse.

Immortal Angelica has only been active from the beginning of July 2007, but the seed from which the band eventually grew from, was planted by founding members Satu and Hanna a long time ago.
