Melodic death metal band from Bolln√§s, Sweden.

Formed as Defective Decay, then a more conventional death metal band.

Truly a band followed by bad luck: they have two full albums that have yet to be released. The first one, "Descent In Silence," was originally to be released on Invasion Records, who "fucked up" and left the album unsigned. The band searched for a new label to release it and found Loud n Proud Records, who backed out of the release citing financial problems, which led the band and LNP into court because the band wanted them to pay for the album, which LNP eventually did, but went bankrupt and took the DIS album with them into the grave.

The second album, "Void of Chaos," was originally scheduled for a 2001 release on Plasmatica Records, then postponed to 2003, and status for both the band and Plasmatica is currently unknown.

Blazing Skies appeared in the VOD Records compilation from 1998, called "Voices Of Death (Part II) - The Book Of Death" with the song "Fullfillment Of Emptiness. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Blazing+Skies">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
