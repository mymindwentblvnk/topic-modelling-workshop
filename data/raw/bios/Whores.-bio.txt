Formed in Spring 2010, Atlanta, GA sludge / noise rock merchants WHORES. (Christian Lembach – Vocals/Guitar, Jake Shultz – Bass, Travis Owen – drums) have quickly become infamous thanks to their crushing live shows and no-holds-barred punk rock attitude. The band signed with Brutal Panda Records in 2011 to unleash their ferocious debut, Ruiner, which went on to receive numerous accolades throughout the heavy and indie music scenes.

After numerous tours and shows across the US with the likes of Torche, Kylesa, Fight Amp, The Atlas Moth, Zozobra and many others, WHORES. return with their sophomore release Clean. Recorded in May 2013 by Ryan Boesch  (Melvins, Helmet, Tomahawk, Fu Manchu) at Parhelion Recording Studios in Atlanta, GA, Clean sees the band refine their crushingly heavy, catchy as fuck rock to violent perfection. Clean was released October 29th on 12″ vinyl and digital formats via Brutal Panda Records.
The bands debut album "Gold" was released October 28th via eOne Music.
