Savath & Savalas is a project of Guillermo Scott Herren (perhaps best known as Prefuse 73), Eva Puyuelo Muns and Roberto Carlos Lange. Their music is often described as Catalan acid-folk though many critics note the influence and inflections of hip-hop and other beat-based stylings in their work. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Savath+Y+Savalas">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
