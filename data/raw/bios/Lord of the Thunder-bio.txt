Everything began when four musicians, Ivan, francisco, Jean Carlos and John, rooted in Maracaibo Zulia Venezuela and decided carry on  this group, experimental band or hybrid metal, combening and respecting opinions, points of views, approaches, beliefs; but however we always had a guided north and converged that pointed toward the pleasure that felt when making music, or to create harmonies, melodies, dissonances, setbacks that satisfied the necesities and each member's restlessness as musician, the freedom of being possible to express with their instrument, the necessity to be able to transmit and to contribute to the new generation of musicians, a Venezuelan metal worthy of no listen and to defend. 
At the moment (the begining of 2004), the vocalist and bassman Daniel Eizaga, guitarist Manuel Parra has united to the members founders, guitarist and main drummer john matheus and Iv√°n chacin to finish the new formation of lord of the thunder.
