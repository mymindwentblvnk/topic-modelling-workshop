1. When you hear Orlando, FL, you may stereotype it with theme parks, boy bands, and vacation. Beneath the surface, however, lies a solid hip-hop scene that would make true believers proud. Enter Critical Madness (CM): the combination of emcess cRITICAL and Madness, two minds put together to create raw music with intricate concepts and pure lyricism, reminiscent of hip-hop's golden era. With both hailing from Central Florida, it was only a matter of time before they crossed paths in the southeastern Battle Circuit thus spawning Critical Madness. 

Their Fat Beats distributed and TEMPERMENTAL produced debut single "1st Amendment" (ft Sabac Red of Non Phixion)/"Dropped" was sold worldwide and reached its peak at Number 2 on College radio and www.RapAttackLives.com in early 2006. They have shared the stage with the likes of The Beatnuts, Little Brother, dead prez, Memphis Bleek and others. Critical Madness has also interviewed and rocked mics on various radio shows and even DJ Eclipse's "Halftime 8 Year Anniversary Show" alongside legends and more. You can find them on numerous DVD's including Proof & Bizarre of D12's "Who Wanna Battle?" and "Underground Session" Vols. 1 &2. Their current release, "Finding The Plot" is a mix of 17 original tracks sure to keep the streets melting until their official debut "Bringing Out The Dead" is released to the masses. With many more collaborations (Joell Ortiz, Yah-Yah & Young Zee of the Outsidaz, Little Vic, Butta Verses, producer extraorinnaire The Mighty V.I.C., Marco Polo, Domingo, TzariZM, and more) and their debut on the horizon, there looks to be an even brighter future for these two unique individuals. This is only the beginning.
