Cold as ice, angry as a horde of Viking warriors, and determined like an army fighting for freedom of their homeland: THUNDERWAR! The band was born in 2013, when four young Metal maniacs decided to join their forces to not only pay their tribute to such Metal heroes as BATHORY, UNLEASHED, DISSECTION or AMON AMARTH, but to prove that Poland has again something to say to the Metal world, after giving birth to cult acts such VADER or BEHEMOTH. Since the very beginning the band decided to work only with the best ones.
Debut EP "THE BIRTH OF THUNDER" was finally mixed and produced by the famous Wieslawscy Bros from HERTZ STUDIO (BEHEMOTH, VADER, DECAPITATED).
Band’s logo was designed by Christophe Szpajdel (EMPEROR, MOONSPELL, DESASTER) and the cover artwork of “The Birth of Thunder” EP was done by Mario Lopez (SABBAT, EVIL INVADERS).
Currently band is promoting self-released EP and in the middle of 2014 will enter the HERTZ STUDIO to work on the first, full-length album, which is gonna be, as band members claim 'a giant step to the next level - higher, than anybody can expect’!
