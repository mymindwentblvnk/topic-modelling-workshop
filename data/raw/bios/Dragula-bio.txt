DRAGULA brought their own brand of blood burning nitro fueled rock and roll straight outta the garage to stages in Nashville and Murfreesboro from 1993 until 1997. They played shows with such luminaries as The Woggles, BR5-49, Los Straitjackets, Nine Pound Hammer, Man Or Astro-Man?, and 30 Amp Fuse. Highlights of such shows included the spontaneous audience wrestling matches which broke out during "Masked Phantom", Whitey spitting up blood, Wally doing the aardvark dance, and the band being introduced by Channel 5 weatherman Leland Statom one fine evening. The band landed two tracks on the Spinout Records compilation Rock Don't Run before crawling back to their coffin in 1997.
