Vektor is a progressive thrash metal band, originally formed in Arizona in 2004 but relocated to Philadelphia in mid-2012 and currently based there. They released their debut full length "Black Future" in November 2009, and the follow up "Outer Isolation" in December 2011 (both on Heavy Artillery Records, now defunct). These albums were re-released when the band joined Earache Records, and the band continued sporadically performing and touring in 2012 and 2013 with the likes of Napalm Death, Municipal Waste, Exhumed, Absu, Cattle Decapitation, and many more. They've done multiple headlining tours across the US as well. Their planned 3rd album is being written as a concept album, and Vektor will see their European debut in June 2013 at Hellfest in France.

As of December 2016, everyone but David DiSanto has left the group to pursue other projects.
