AMENTIA was formed in 2003 by Alex (bass, vocal) and Victor (drums).
Due to the constant problems with guitarists the band didn’t develop in a necessary way, but the composed material was replenishing.
In 2005 STAS (guitar) joined the band and Victor (DEOFEL) was replaced by FORNEUS (ID:VISION). The line-up was formed and AMENTIA started functioning as a real band. In the end of 2005 guys entered the studio SEHR GUT to record their first mini-album “Mind Degradation” with sound producer Iron Gleb. This album was recorded with the following line-up: ALEX (bass, drums, voice) and STAS (guitars). Musicians were too busy in their main bands and AMENTIA was still just a studio project. “Mind Degradation” was released as a split with FORMALIN, FOREVER DEAD and SERRANDO CODOS by the Moscow label COYOTE Recs.
Meanwhile the band started recording the full-length album “Burn To Hate” with ALEX on bass and vocals, GOZARD on rhythm guitars, MAKS on lead and rhythm guitars and FIENDHARON (POSTHUMOUS BLASPHEMER) as a guest musician on lead and rhythm guitars. This album was released by the Moscow label “Soulflesh Collector” in March 2007. It consisted of 7 tracks and one cover of legendary belarussian band EXHUMATOR “Crucifixion Decapitated” + live video.
In 2006 AMENTIA played the first gig.
At the present moment the line-up is:
ALEX – bass;
ARTYOM – guitars;
ANDREAS – guitars;
VADIM – vocals.
