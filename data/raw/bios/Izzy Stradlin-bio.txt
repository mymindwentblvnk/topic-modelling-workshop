Izzy Stradlin is best known as the former rhythm guitarist and song-writer in Guns N' Roses. He left Guns N' Roses on their Use your Illusion world tour in November, 1991. 

Following his departure, Izzy formed a new solo band, Izzy Stradlin and the Ju Ju Hounds. Their self-titled debut album was released in the autumn 1992. Following the release the band went on tour, and returned to the studio to record the follow up. Without the album finished, however, they disbanded and the album was not released. 

Izzy left the public eye until 1997, when he released 117ยบ. This country rock style album contained a cover of Chuck Berry's 'Memphis'. In 2000, he released 'Ride On' but, disappointingly, only in Japan. He managed another few shows, before releasing 'River', this time worldwide. 2002 saw the release of 'On Down The Road' and his most recent album, came back in 2003 under the title "Like a Dog". This was only released over the internet though, but a petition from a fan ensured more copies were made. Izzy recently released a new album in 2007, entitled "Miami" over the internet. Soon after a remixed version appeared, as well. After he left Guns N' Roses he has played straight forward rock n' roll. 

Izzy appeared on stage with Guns N' Roses on their 2006 Chinese Democracy tour, 15 years after having left the band as a full-time member.
