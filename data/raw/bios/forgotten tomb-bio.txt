Forgotten Tomb is a black metal band formed in Piacenza, Italy in 1999 by Ferdinando "Herr Morbid" Marchisio. The band is well-known for being among the pioneers of the so-called depressive black metal subgenre. The lyrical themes of the early albums revolve mostly around depression and suicide, while the recent albums lyrics deal with negativity and nihilism.

Forgotten Tomb's debut recording, "Obscura Arcana Mortis", was recorded by Herr Morbid as a solo undertaking in 1999. It was released the following year in CD format through Treblinka Productions and limited to 215 pieces. The band's first full-length album, "Songs to Leave", was released in August 2002 through Selbstmord Services. After several line-up changes, the album was followed by "Springtime Depression" in June 2003 and "Love's Burial Ground" in September 2004. Both albums were released through Adipocere Records. In 2006, Forgotten Tomb signed with Avantgarde Music and recorded its fourth full-length, "Negative Megalomania". The album was released in January 2007.

A compilation album, "Vol. 5: 1999-2009" featuring re-recordings of classic songs and two full covers by Nirvana and Black Flag as well as an intro section to Subway Apathy (which is Black Sabbath's self titled track), was released in August 2010 on Avantgarde Music.

Their fifth album "Under Saturn Retrograde" was released in April 2011 through Agonia Records. Their latest album "...And Don't Deliver Us From Evil" was released in October 2012, again on Agonia Records, with the first single "Deprived" released in September 2012. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Forgotten+Tomb">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
