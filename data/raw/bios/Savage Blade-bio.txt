Savage Blade is a new power metal outfit formed by Eric Hoodicoff (Jermun, Lillix, The Fuckstixx), Christopher Rand (BC/DC, Jermun), and vocalist Nikko Forsberg. Fueled by the NWOBHM and the classic power metal bands of the early eighties, Savage Blade pledge to Kill 'Em All For One.

Their debut album, "We Are The Hammer" was recorded in Nelson BC, Canada, with the assistance of producer/engineer Andy Chute, engineer Cole St. Denys, and mixed by Vancouver-based producer, Futcher. Chock-full of vintage riffs, pounding rhythms, instantly memorable hooks and balls-to-the-wall vocals, the album is sure to strike a chord with fans of the classic metal bands of the early 80's.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Savage+Blade">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
