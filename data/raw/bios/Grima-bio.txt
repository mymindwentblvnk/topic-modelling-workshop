Grima is a duo from the dark woods of Siberia, Russia, which exists since 2014 performing only in studio. It is an atmospheric black metal from Siberia with pagan influence. Their mythology is based on the worship of the elder forest, its power and magic, where the Grima is a supreme god. It is a powerful spirit, who protects only those who lives in a forest, and punishes everyone who does not respect the nature.

The first live appearances occurred in Russia during spring 2021, for the “Rotten Spring Tour”, with one recorded show in Moscow on the 21st of April: "The Mighty Spirit (Live in Moscow).
In June/July 2022, they did their first European tour, with Ultar (Ru) and Bloody Tyrant (Taiwan), under the banner of Asgaardian Event.
