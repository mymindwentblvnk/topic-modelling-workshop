There are lots of bands called Leech, all play variations of Rock: a Swiss experimental rock band, an Oregon black metal band, a Belgian Rock band, a Dutch Post-grunge/Rock band, a German Rock band, a Swedish Metal Band and an Estonian Alternative metal group. 

Swiss progressive rock / Instrumental Band

Leech was formed in 1995 by Marcel Meyer (Guitar, Piano), Urs Meyer (Guitar, Piano) and Serge Olar (Drums). Right from the start the band devoted itself to experimental instrumental music - rhythmic figures are developed and connected with floating melodies - this all fuses in an epic sound landscape where time becomes irrelevant.

Just one year after the formation of the band, the first Leech album "Instarmental" (1996) was released. This was only recorded on two sound tracks, live and upolished. More than fifty perfomances in Switzerland and Germany followed, receiving broad positive feedback. At the same time the band was working on their second album "Soundtrack to an Individual Emotion Picture Mindmovie" which was released in 1998. Numerous concerts in Switzerland and bordering countries followed the release of this second album.

In 2000 Leech presented their third album "Zerotonine Days" on which for the first time and exceptionally, there was also a track with vocals. In the following two years Leech was in an extensive phase of experimentation and there were multiple projects with guest musicians from various different musical directions. These projects were presented live but were never recorded. During this phase the band members moved in different musical directions and it was decided to put Leech as a band on hold. 

In the summer of 2006 Leech was launched again. The band carried on where they had stopped five years before. This yielded to their latest album “The Stolen View” (autumn 2007). Numerous live performances followed the release of “The Stolen View” in Switzerland. 

Leech has now joined the roster of Viva Hate Records, a fine Label based in Berlin. “The Stolen View was released in Germany (and other European countries) through Viva Hate Records (German release in October 2008). In addition, Leech released a split with the German instrumental band Long Distance Calling. The split record contains two tracks from each band.

Belgian rockband

In the year 2000 Leech got off to a great start winning Studio Brussel's  'Demopoll'. Instead of rolling with the good fortune, guitarist Tim Van Aelst took off to New York City and the band was put on hold.  Hanging out in the East Village, the heart of the New York rock scene, he got tight with some of the local musicians and was introduced to Tim Bluto after a performance at CBGB.  The two Tim's hit it off and started hanging out writing some songs together on acoustic guitars. 

After a couple of months Tim returned to Belgium and Leech started up again. Later that summer Bluto came over, lured by a solo acoustic tour, and hung out with the Leech guys all the time. One day at a rehearsal Tim suggested that Bluto try singing one of the songs and it became pretty obvious to everyone that something cool was happening.  The band was excited about the possibilities that Bluto's strong vocals opened up and Bluto loved the camaraderie and 'egoless' manner of the boys from Kontich, a big change from his NY experiences.  Leech was about to go through a big transformation.  

Switching gears from 'pop' to 'rock' the new Leech with Bluto on the vocals came out at the 2002 Rock Rally, drawing the attention of Axl Peleman.  He took them to Motormusic studio (Novastar, Dead Man Ray, .Calibre) to track the second demo and that caught the interest of studio owner Hans Bellens.  Leech spent the next year and a half touring around the country, developing their sound and a powerful live show and let the wheels spin for awhile. 

A little bit of patience paid off.  In the summer of 2004 Leech met Mario Goossens (Hooverphonic, Triggerfinger) who came aboard as the producer and Bellens offered the band a contract on his new label 'Evil Penguin'. Leech went back to the studio in January to record the debut album 'Leave It So'. The album represents the progression of the band, retaining the pop sensibilities of the early Leech efforts but adding the powerful vocals that Bluto brought to the table as well as capturing the live energy the band developed from the constant touring.
