At least two groups known under the name Rainforest - Poland Rock band and UK Techno and Trance collaboration.

1. An extraordinary band with a very special musical style is Rainforest from Wroclaw, Poland. They call their style Art-Grunge-Core.

Groovy drum and bass rhythms build a powerful and precise foundation for their own style between artrock, grunge and even harder music, with well sourced out breaks and electrifying guitar melodies.

2. Rainforest are Matthew Clayden and Tony Crooks from United Kingdom, also known as Project X. Being active in early 90s, they released a number of techno and classic trance recordings including 'The Birds' which got licensed by several different labels around Europe. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rainforest">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
