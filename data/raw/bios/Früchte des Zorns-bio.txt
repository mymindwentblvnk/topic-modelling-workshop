Früchte des Zorns is a radical left-wing band from Berlin, Germany, consisting of:Mogli (vocals and guitar)Anke (violin, viola, vocals)Hannah (drums, vocals)
The band wants to point out injustice as well as the suppressed feelings in everyone of us.

According to themselves, the band was founded "in front of the main entry of the Altona station" (so, probably in Hamburg) in 1999 as a Duo (Mogli and Anke). They fell out during the recordings for their first CD In meinem Kopf ist eine Bombe in the end of 2000, but were able to reconcile during their joint work for the common art project Revolte Springen. There, they met Hannah, whom they asked to play the drums on their planned farewell CD.
When the CD zwischen leben und Überleben was finished in 2003, it was more of a recommencement as a Trio. The single Das Herz ist ein Muskel in der Größe einer Faust (2005) and the album Wie Antennen in den Himmel (2007) followed.
