They are not named after a World of Warcraft character and their 4th album cover has nothing to do with Adventure Time. 

The point of Lich King was to create new old-school thrash metal in the vein of Exodus, Vio-Lence, S.O.D., Slayer and others. Lots of bands in the new wave of thrash these days are doing just that, but they stand out.  The band itself admits this.

Tom Martin started Lich King as a one-man project around 2004, as a goof.  People seemed to like the music.  Their first two albums were released as a solo project posing as an actual band. In 2009 Tom cannibalized a local thrash act called Ages Ago and formed Lich King as a true band for the first time. 

They think the sound of thrash was perfected in the 80’s and they're not trying to add anything to the mix.  They're coming up with riffs and songs that the old masters didn’t.  Despite that fact and their best efforts, they seem to be developing a signature sound.

They have five full-length albums as of 2017.  Each features fast, headbangable riffs in modern stomp anthems, a sometimes comedic yet always violent songwriting sensibility, art and design from the guy that writes the songs and does vocals, a marked step up in quality from the previous release, an awesome logo and a mascot.
