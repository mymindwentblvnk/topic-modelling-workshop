Cult of Reborn is a Death / Black Metal band from Å ibenik, Croatia.
The band started in the year 2000. as a four individual hardcore band / project under the name Reborn.
In 2003., the band receives an infusion of fresh blood, a new drummer, Jere, who brought more energy into the whole unit. Songs become faster and brutal, more metalish...a year later, Reborn records it's first demo. But the members were not satisfied, realising their technical immaturity. Reborn afterwards spent quite some time at rehearsals, in hope of doing a good job ! In the beginning of the year 2008. there was another conflux of hot, new blood to the machine, as Ante, an old friend, became the new guitar player in the band. Their first official demo, Reborn, was self-released in 2010.
In 2011 the band changed their name to Cult of Reborn and self-released their  first album / EP, Ascending.
