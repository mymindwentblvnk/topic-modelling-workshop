Arcis is a talented artist from Oslo, Norway which produces music with an authentic 80s feeling, there’s a lot of artists trying to emulate that authentic 80s sound but Arcis is definitely one of the best for successfully achieving it.

From the cold lands of Norway to the hottest summer days in Miami, Arcis’s music is intensively nostalgic and gives perfectly that Miami Vice feeling. This is the kind of music you want to listen while driving an offshore boat during the sunset.

The production behind Arcis’s music is really impressive, the choice of the instruments, the melodies, there’s a deep composition with serious skills. It’s hard to believe this was made nowadays, you can’t tell if the music is from the 80s or 2016. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Arcis">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
