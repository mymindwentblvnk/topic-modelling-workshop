Seven Bowls of Wrath were a hardcore/metal band from Germany (Saarbrόcken, Saarland/Cologne & North Rhine-Westphalia), claiming influences ranging from Acme to Mörser through Crowpath and His hero is gone. 

They were founded in the summer of 2004 by the ashes of the screamo band katyn and a member of eaves. They were Christian Mautes on Vocals, Moritz Czarny on Guitar/Vocals (Katyn, Mills of God), Christian Bost on Guitar/Vocals (Katyn, the Loverfighters), Martin Wilhelm on Bass (eaves, Katyn, Trainwreck) and Marc Kalan on Drums. 

In 2005, they started to have their fist shows toured mainly in Germany. They self-released their Demo 3" CDr, limited to 50 copies. 2006 saw them sharing stage with Hewhocorrupts, An albatross, municipal waste, baroness, and torche among others. The demo was re-released, again in 50 copies. In August, SBOW released their first official release, a split 12" with the technical metalcore outft Achilles on the German label Bloom: Explode!. In October, the songs that were released originally on ther split 12" were re-released on CD. The EP is entitled Salt Your Wounds and was released on Atropine Records from France. 

As it was getting more and more difficult to face the geographical distances between members they decided to part ways shortly after the release of the CD. Chris (Vocals) is forming a new band with members of B.abuse and Llynch. Christian (Guitar/Vocals) will keep on playing with the Loverfighters and is focusing more on his singer/songwriter project as well as on other projects. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Seven+Bowls+of+Wrath">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
