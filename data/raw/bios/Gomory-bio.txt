There are three bands operating under the name: Gomory.

1. Gomory (France) - Brutal Death/Thrash Metal

GOMORY incarnated as a Southern France band in anno 2001, this entity's will is voiced through Naja-Atra (lyricist, drums & vocals) and Incertaesedis (guitars, bass guitar & backing vocals). Their members were involved in different bands, projects and have been playing together since 1994 worshipping Germany’s Cult thrash scene and the actual Brutal death genre. Their debut recording is the opening chapter of a collection of curses having a beginning and an end, its theme is a kind of Philosophical relationship between freedom and slavery; a new conception, a new light, the vision of GOMORY. Immerse yourself into this Universe to maybe discover the entrance of the Underworld Gate of hidden riddles, ties between names and stories. “Destruction & Misery“, the band's first full length album has been cast by the label Snakebite in October 2004. Initially the band didn’t want to release a professional recording, but both the strange vocal nature and the percussive violent sound enhanced in Winterized Studio (France-EU) turned out to be so interesting that at the end of mastering breached this evil smelting. GOMORY recorded the new album, a new level of intense brutality with a new member on vocals, Bastich (FLESHDOLL). The band is now looking for a label to release the album, and then let's spread the disease on stage!!!
