The five guys in Garden Of Eden are the mavericks of dark&roll in Hungary. Their music is passionate, sexy, melancholic, strongly connected to the dark/goth scene, but has a cool,unique rock&roll sound. They're together since 1998-1999 and in these years made numerous great concerts with an unforgettable athmosphere. The guys played all around the country, and attended all major festivals in Hungary (Sziget, Nightbreed, Wan2, Gothica etc).
