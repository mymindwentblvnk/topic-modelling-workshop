Morbid Scream was an American thrash metal band formed in 1986 (first named Necrosis then changed to Morbid Scream a year later), in Plano, Texas. The band only released two demos: The first in 1987, and the second, a self-titled demo, in 1989. In 1990, the band changed their name to The Morbid and released one final demo entitled "The Morbider the Merrier" that same year. 

In 2007, a compilation of Morbid Scream's demos and live material was released Proscriptor McGovern's (Absu) Tarot Productions under the name The Signal to Attack: 1986-1990. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Morbid+Scream">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
