Berlin thrashmetal band with hardcore influences and a modern touch. Disbanded in 2007, after playing loads of shows over the years and releasing an ep called "round one" in 2003. They also recorded a great eponymous debut album in 2005. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Prohibited">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
