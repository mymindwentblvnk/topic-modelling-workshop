Based out of the forty-ninth smallest state of Delaware, Dead And Buried have been delivering a punishing concoction of hardcore and metal that draws influence from All Out War, Merauder, and Cro-Mags, and Slayer, among others as they’ve persevered for the past eight years.

Dead and Buried has two previous full-length recordings under their belt, "Bloodless" on DFF Records and “The Company I Keep” for Spook City Records.

The band recently signed to Escapist Records and will issue their first recording in five years, "Bear Witness," this Fall.  Dead and Buried has amassed an arsenal of new songs that demonstrate their strengthening as a band with songs that will blow their previous work completely out of the water.

During their tenure as a band, Dead and Buried has shared the stage with many notables: All Out War, Death Threat, Death Before Dishonor, Ramallah, Terror, Out to Win, Reign Supreme, and more. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dead+and+Buried">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
