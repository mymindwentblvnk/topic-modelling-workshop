1) EdOne is an electronic artist and DJ from Spain. 
“Involved with music at a very young age, EdOne has already proven to the world what he’s capable of creating with his unique and very melodic style. Fairly established on the scene with releases on labels such as Bedrock, TAU and Innervisions just to name a few, he’s also created his own imprint this year called Surrrealism with the goal to expand his name as a brand, that doesn’t only focus on music but also on creating its own and exclusive designs with major influence by the artistic movement surrealism, hence the name. Recently Eduardo has also released an EP on John Digweed’s label, so we saw it as an opportunity to catch up with the Spanish artist and digging a little deeper into its creation as well as getting to know him a little bit better.”
