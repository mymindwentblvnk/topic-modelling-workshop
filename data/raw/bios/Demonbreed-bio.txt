“Stomping extreme thrashcore metalicus maximus from the South Coast of England” (Organ Magazine). 2003 saw Demonbreed roar onto the scene in local rock venues, and after an unstable period concerning the line-up, the addition of Stu completed what was to become the band with “enough energy to fuel Glastonbury” (Dead Ernest). Having been on the scene for a year and a half previous to the creation of the band, the members have now got extensive experience of touring and recording (previous projects include local hardcore outfit Four Random Words, Lost End and North by Northwest). After releasing a self-financed EP in November 2004 (‘Middle Finger Up’), the band teamed up with Nick Hemmingway to produce the acclaimed ‘Closer to God’, an album that has received glowing reviews.
