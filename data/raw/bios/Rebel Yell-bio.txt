5) Rebel Yell formed in the small town of Meeuwen, Belgium, in the summer of 2008. Drummer Marc, guitarist/lead vocalist Diether and guitarist Dag were all done with previous projects in search for their own rock ‘n roll dream. The three rockers started writing songs. Next came Cava, our bass player & other lead vocalist as the final piece to the line-up. As a four-piece they became a great Rock ‘n Roll band that leaves you the feeling as if you’ve just been hit over the head with a big hard dose of rock.
