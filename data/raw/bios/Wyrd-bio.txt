Wyrd was originally formed under the name of Hellkult in Hyvinkää, Uusimaa, Finland. After the departure of Kalma in 1998, it became a solo project of Narqath (also in Azaghal) until 2005, when JL Nokturnal joined as drummer. Wyrd makes a folkloristic version of black metal and the lyrics are about old folklore and Nordic mythology.
