LATHSPELL was founded in the winter of 1998. First recordings took place in 1999 in a friend’s basement but the sound was so awful that the tracks were never released. second recording was in 2000 at New Noise Studio, this time with a better equipment. Yet we were not too happy with the results and decided to not release the material, copies were only given to a number of friends. After this we lost our rehearsal place due to some heavy partying that took place there. The next recording wasn’t until in the beginning of 2004, now with a new line-up. This time we recorded everything ourselves and it came out good (read evil). The demo "Fascination Of The Devil’s Art" was sent to a number of labels which anyhow were not interested. It wasn’t until we recorded "Deviltry" -demo later 2004 that caught some interest in the German label Excesor Christianorum Records. Both demos from 2004 were released on cd format in summer 2005, under the name "Fascination Of Deviltry". The first edition was 500 copies which were sold out in 8 months. A second pressing was done in the beginning of 2006. During March 2006 we recorded the material for the next album, "Versus Ecclesia", which was released 6.6.2006 in edition of 500 copies. Both cd’s were sold out by the beginning of 2007, and the vinyl version of "Versus Ecclesia" was released in February 2007. The vinyl edition is limited to 500 handnumbered copies including A5-sized 8-page booklet with new artwork. In spring 2007 a second pressing of "Versus Ecclesia" cd was released as an edition of 500 copies. New album "Elegia" was released 1.2.2008, also on ECR. First pressing 1000 copies in 3-fold digipak with 8-page booklet. Next release will be a split-7" with German black metallers KRATER. This will be released in mid-2008.
