Heavy/thrash metal band from Río Grande, Tierra del Fuego formed in 1992. The band's name is an acronym for the title of an Hermética song, "Ayer deseo hoy es realidad", although the acronym is wrong, since the original song title is Ayer deseo hoy realidad. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/A.D.H.E.R.">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
