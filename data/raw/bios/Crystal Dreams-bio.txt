1- Crystal Dreams is an Italian eurodance project produced by Charlie Mauthe and Emilio Bagnasco.
Singles: “Every Woman”. 

2- Crystal Dreams is the brain child of musician and keyboard player Joel Sutton who is based in Canberra, Australia. Joel brings together tracks in both the ambient and new age genres using a combination of analog synthesizer sounds and traditional new age sounds (e.g. Waterfalls, Koto, Bamboo Flute, and Pan Flute). The end results are a blend of melodic relaxation journeys and meditative ambient landscapes all with a strong emphasis on improvisation.
