Formed in the west coast of Finland in mid 2007 Concrete Icon was right from the beginning determined to move along darkened paths of death metal with their monolithic riffs and melancholic melodies. Lyrically plunging into twisted depths of anxiety, suffering, death and religious morbidity the band is on its way to infect the underground with their blackened sermons. So far they have released two demos “Flood of darkened thoughts (2008)”, “Desecrating the throne (2010)” and EP “Where the horns reign (2012)”. While suffering from series of line-up changes since the formation days the band has stayed true to their darkened vision and is now barging ahead to unleash their first full length opus titled “Perennial anguish” in may 2013 on Black Vulture Records from Sweden. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Concrete+Icon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
