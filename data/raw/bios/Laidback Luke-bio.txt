Laidback Luke (born Luke van Scheppingen, 22 October 1976 in Manila, Philippines) is a Dutch DJ and producer. 

When he was a little boy DJ Laidback Luke used to love Mozart and Beethoven. Ever since he's tried to transmit the sounds of these composers into his music. He was voted #17 on DJ Mag's Top 100 DJ list in 2010.

Laidback Luke grew up in The Netherlands and made his name as a graffiti artist before turning to making music. He has worked with artists such as David Guetta, Steve Angello, Sebastian Ingrosso and Junior Sanchez and played throughout Europe and North America as well as shows in Japan and Ibiza. He has released two studio albums: Psyched Up (1998) and Electronic Satisfaction (2002) as well as a successful mix album, Windmill Skill (2003). In 2003, van Scheppingen did a remix of the Daft Punk song "Crescendolls" for the duo's poorly-received remix album Daft Club. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Laidback+Luke">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
