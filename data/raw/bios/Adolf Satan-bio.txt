Adolf Satan is made up of Larry Lifeless (Kilslug, Upsidedown Cross, Angry Hate) Josh Martin (Anal Cunt, Upsidedown Cross), Nate Linehan (Anal Cunt) and Nick Camilleri from Kevorkian's Angels used to play bass, but he was recently kicked out. 

Adolf Satan play very sloppy and sleezy Sludge Metal. Instead of Larry Lifeless's usual drugged out whining voice, he screams a lot more in this band, sometimes resembling Seth Putnam. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Adolf+Satan">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
