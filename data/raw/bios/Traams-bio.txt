TRAAMS formed in summer 2011 in the most unsuspectingly quaint surroundings of Chichester, West Sussex. They wrote one huge thunderous song during their first rehearsal that made spires quiver and cobbles wobble, and so Stu, Adam and Leigh decided to do this again every week. It seemed like a more productive pastime than how they first met, at the club night frontman Stu used to run, in what must have been the most exciting place in their hometown at that moment. From those darkened corners sprung forth the noisey, joyous krautrock squall that is TRAAMS. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Traams">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
