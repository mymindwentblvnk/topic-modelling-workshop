belgian band that makes folk metal and handed out free demo's at paganfest, thank you for the demo's ^^

What do you get when you mix metal with the terms “power” and “folk”? 
Angeli di Pietra, of course! 
This Antwerp-based band came to life in 2002 and after a rocky start found the members to complete their goal of world domination. Even though their first demo-offering, “Songs of Solace” (2004) didn't match up to the band's expectations, it provided the learning process needed to really kick some ass by improving the songs. 
Their second demo, “Believe in Angels” (2005) (produced at Grindhouse Studios and mastered at the world famous Midas Studios in Lokeren) was a vast improvement, both thanks to new members, better songwriting and a superb production. 
With over 50 performances, Angeli Di Pietra became a very convincing live band. In 2008 Angeli Di Pietra won the Paganfest-contest and opened the Belgian edition, supporting a.o.: Eluveitie, Korpiklaani and Ensiferum. Now, anno 2009, Angeli Di Pietra is ready to present you their first full-length album: “Storm Over Scaldis” (recorded August 2008 – Excess Studios Rotterdam - NL). 
But the band has never been one to rest at ease and Angeli di Pietra are constantly evolving to bring you the mightiest in metal, power and folk; in short: POWERFOLK FOR THE MASSES!
