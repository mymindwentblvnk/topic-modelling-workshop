Parallel Dance Ensemble is the brainchild of Denmark hip hop producer Robin Hannibal of Owusu & Hannibal fame and New Zealand rapper Coco Solid. They started making music after meeting at the 2008 Red Bull Music Academy. The latest 8 track EP is on German label Permanent Vacation. They have released first EP in 2009 on Yam Who?'s record label Izm Records. Their sound is slightly reminiscent of the 80's groups Tom Tom Club, Pop Group and the Bush Tetras, but totally futuristic like M.I.A. or New Young Pony Club.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Parallel+Dance+Ensemble">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
