Liphe is the alias of producer and recording engineer Joe Derrington. The project was born in 2011 out of a love for chilled out vibes and electro-acoustical synthesis.

In Summer 2014, Liphe released the debut EP 'Inside Forest' which combines elements of Hip-Hop, Dubstep and Ambient electronica. The album was composed using a mixture of live and synthesised instrumentation. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Liphe">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
