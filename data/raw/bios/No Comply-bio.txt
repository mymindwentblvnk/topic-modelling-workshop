Memphis band that has an ex member of the legendary Deathreat on bass, and the drummer was in Left For Dead and Blank Is Born. They play basic, fast hardcore based on brutal 80s/90s hardcore like Copout and Born Against. Sounds much more like State Of Alert and the Youth Brigade to me. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/No+Comply">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
