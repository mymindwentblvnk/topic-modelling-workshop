Lewis Loh, also known as LEW, is a twenty two year old Singaporean singer-songwriter who translates something intangible, emotion, into an embrace that is rough but real. His voice is a melodic silky sound that hugs you like a friend, and takes you home. In 2017, LEW released his debut album Lullacry at his sold-out album launch. The thirteen track album, produced by Bani Hidir, is a collection of stories that describe the true nature of love; love is complex, beautiful and painful.
In 2018, LEW released ENFJ - an EP about some of the facets of the human condition that one may experience, and There's Something in My Eye - an EP about falling in love, and then learning to navigate long distance and communication. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lew">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
