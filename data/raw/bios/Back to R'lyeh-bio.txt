Hailing from the depths of the capital city of Spain, Back to R’lyeh is an experimental metal project led by five Cthulhu acolytes with a solid musical background. Rooted in Avant Garde and Progressive Metal, their sound seamlessly incorporates hints of Jazz, Country and Classic Rock, while maintaining the aggressiveness of darker genres such as Black Metal, Death Metal and Doom.

This unique act is complemented with outrageous and powerful live presentations and lyrical themes based on the universe created by the larger than life writer H.P. Lovecraft in his Cthulhu Mythos. The band’s debut is The Awakening / Last Fight of the Primordial, a concept album that portraits the struggles of the anthropologist Basil Abscond after discovering the traces of a long lost race that seemed to worship obscure and mysterious deities. This story is unfolded over an eleven track stravaganzza full of both plot and musical twists. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Back+To+R%27lyeh">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
