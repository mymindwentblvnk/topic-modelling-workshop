Black metal from Lisbon, Portugal

HOOFMARK is a studio-only project mainly inspired by old heavy music.

HOOFMARKâ€™s sound is deeply rooted on the lo-fi, simple and yet exaggerated aesthetics of 84-87 hardcore infused underground metal, as well as on the often poignant narratives of country music.

First demo now available online (Bandcamp) and on cassette.
