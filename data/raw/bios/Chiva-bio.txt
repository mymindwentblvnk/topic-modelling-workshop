Celtic Frost inspired side project of Sadness member Chiva, released one EP (Oracle Morte) in 1996. According to Chiva: "This project stay parallel to my band Sadness, it's only a desire to realise my personal work through a different and majestic music. It's a real reflection about my true personality and my own convictions. I predict you the end of a world for 1999, I regret but it's only the prophecy. I'm the first Baron!!!" <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Chiva">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
