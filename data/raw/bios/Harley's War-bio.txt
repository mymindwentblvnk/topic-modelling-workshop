By the early 21st century, it had become increasingly difficult to determine which Cro-Mags were out touring and recording (the band featuring John Joseph, or the band featuring Harley Flanagan?). Perhaps sensing this, Flanagan formed a new outfit, Harley's War, but his choice of the title for the group's debut, Cro-Mag, probably only added to the confusion. Regardless, the album proves the veteran hardcore bassist still has plenty of pent-up venom to unleash -- especially evident in the album's opener, "F**k the Middle East ('Last Days')." Co-credited to "Hardcore All Stars," the album features contributions from members of such renowned bands as Warzone, Bad Brains, Agnostic Front, and Suicidal Tendencies, and longtime fans will be interested in hearing several bonus tracks tacked on at the end -- four recorded during 1982-1983 (just before the formation of the Cro-Mags), as well as a 1981 live track from the Stimulators (a punk band that featured a preteen Flanagan on drums).  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Harley%27s+War">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
