Hailing from North Carolina, The Love Language began after frontman Stuart McLamb's first band, The Capulets, broke up.  Following a breakup with his girlfriend, McLamb went on a serious drinking binge and then retreated to his parents' house, where he began recording a series of emotional demos.  These songs were originally intended to be heard only by McLamb's ex-girlfriend and a handful of friends, but the demos expanded into a full recording project.

Diehard romantics with a sarcastic streak, The Love Language take a heartfelt approach to the rattle and hum of their orchestral pop.

The Love Language is Stuart McLamb (electric guitar, vocals), Jordan McLamb (percussion, vocals), Missy Thangs (keyboard, vocals), Justin Rodermond (bass guitar, vocals), BJ Burton (Electric guitar, vocals).
