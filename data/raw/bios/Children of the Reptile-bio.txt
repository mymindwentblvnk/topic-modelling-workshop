Children of the Reptile was first birthed in the prehistoric swamps of Wilmington, NC in summer of 2008 by Ozzie Darden. This first iteration of the band didn't last long and featured Ozzie Darden on guitar and vocals, Chris Millard on guitar, Casey Tucker on bass, and Steve Gillespie on drums. COTR ended in November of 2008, but was reborn in August 2009 with Ozzie Darden and Chris Millard reprising their former roles and with the addition of David Hufham on bass and Jon Kiker on drums. They currently reside in Wilmington, North Carolina and enjoy basking in the sun during the daytime in order to maintain enough body heat in order to rock appropriately hard.

Children of the Reptile plays a synthesis of doom, thrash, and power metal with a few grooves thrown in for good measure.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Children+of+the+Reptile">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
