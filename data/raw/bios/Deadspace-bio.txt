Deadspace is a Depressive Black Metal band from Perth in Australia. A descent into the hollowed out void of a dejected soul, rejecting comfort, choking light, foreboding darkness. Deadspace is a band that deliver an emasculating and claustrophobic live assault. Unwanted, uncomfortable, unrelenting and unforgiving. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Deadspace">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
