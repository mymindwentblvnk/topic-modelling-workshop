There are several bands known as Disdain:
1) Gothenburg band
2)  Dutch metalcore

1) Disdain is a band from Gothenburg, Sweden. Their debut album 'Leave this World', was released in early February 2010 on Scarlet Records.

Their wide range of influences include bands such as Iced Earth, Nocturnal Rites, Metallica, Dark Tranquillity, In Flames and many more, but it's life in general that inspires their music, which often deals with subjects such as escaping difficult situations by fighting your way through them, thinking on your own and being resourceful individuals when hard times come.

The album was recorded, mixed and mastered in cooperation with Studiomega in Varberg, Sweden (Tiamat, Katatonia, Sonic Syndicate, Beseech, Lake Of Tears), and includes guest appearances by Swedish guitarist Mattias "IA" Eklundh and former Lost Horizon singer Daniel Heiman.

2) A Dutch metalcore band from the late '90s. They started out in January 1997 with members of Maypole, Daisy's Dum Dum, Tribute and Tryptizol 50mg. They played a lot in the Netherlands and Belgium and released several live demo's. In early 1998 they entered the studio and recorded several tracks, which would be used for a split 7" with Swedish band Seasons Change and several compilations, including the 'Fear No Evil' compilation which was released by Last Word Records out of the USA. Over the course of their existence, Disdain has had a bunch of member-changes, which were always guitarists. In mid 2000 the band ended. In 2001 the band got asked to do a reunion, so several reunion-shows were played. In 2005 the band played 2 more reunion-shows. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Disdain">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
