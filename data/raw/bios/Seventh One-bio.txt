Seventh One was formed in 1997 by Christoffer Hermansson (guitar) and Johannes Losbäck(guitar). They contacted Jörgen Olsson (Bass), Jonny Edvardsson (Drums) and Rino Fredh (Vocals) to complete the line-up.
 The demo-cd was out on the streets at the end of summer 99 . One of the MetalMagazines which received the demo was Rock Hard. On the 11th of Nov. 99, they offered Seventh One a place on the compilation cd "Unerhört!" with the song "The Seventh Eye" from the demo. 
 Around this time they changed drummer and called in Mats Karlsson.
In nov 2000 the demo "The Celestial Prophecy" got recorded. One of the labels that showed interest was Lars Ratz (Metalium) Armageddon and he offered  to have them recording at his place in Hamburg, Germany.
 Before recording their debut album "Sacrifice" they parted ways with the drummer Mats and replaced him with Tobias R.Kellgren.
 "Sacrifice" was released on the 31th of October through Massacre in Europe. It got very good feedback from Metal Media worldwide. In August the same year Seventh One performed at the Wacken Open air festival in Germany, before an entusiastic crowd.
 In 2004 they released their second album called "What should not Be". It includes 9 tracks and a bonus one for the release in Japan.
 Since 2005 the group has stopped updating their official site and there's no further information about their activity. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Seventh+One">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
