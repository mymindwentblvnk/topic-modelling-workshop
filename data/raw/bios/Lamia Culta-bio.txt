"Lamia Culta" (from latin "Witch Cult") was formed in 2003 with the following line-up: Krupyak Yuri (guitar, vocals), Kaschin Vitali (drums), Lobzin Maxim (guitar), Michael Zhorin (bass). Due to different understandings of heavy music Lobzin Maxim (Polynove Pole, Riff Inc.) is leaving the band, shortly afterwards being replaced by Alexander "Yor" Garasimovich. With the arrival of the team Carina "Fosco Culto" Kulik (keyboards) band finally determines its style, general concept and name. Through ideological misunderstandings Yuri Krupyak leaves the team for Ambivalence and Polynove Pole, Michael Zhorin also leaves for Ruina. The creative activity of the team stopped. Soon a new vocalist Roman "Unholy" Shimansky joins the team. Together with this team played session bass player Valery "Valer" Dmitry "Demon" (Ambivalence, Bazooka Band), and guitarist Sergei Filyak (Kroda , Capitolium). The work with former session players recorded a few demos and participated in black metal compilation "Carpathian might". The group was on the verge of disintegration. After some time the team joins a new drummer - Michael "Arian" Dudych. Roman "Unholy" leaves the team.
