Symphonic gothic metal group Gate Of Sorrow came from Uhersky Ostroh, Czech Republic . The band was formed in 2006 by members of their previous metal band named Gate. Members of Gate have released three albums, but changing the genre of music they played was the reason to change the band name to Gate Of Sorrow. Gate Of Sorrow plays very atmospheric music with female soprano-coloured voice combined with male dark vocals. Songs they play are full of dark and extreme metal riffs combined with sad melodies. The musicians are influenced by many metal genres like doom metal, death metal, gothic metal or symphonic metal and many more.. When you listen to them carefully, sometimes you can hear some influences from northern metal sound.
Members:
Milada Miltáková (Female soprano, cello)
Roman Tureček (Dark vocals, Guitar)
Dušan Tureček (Drums)
Bohumil Zajíček (Bass guitar)
Ludvík Číhánek (Keyboards)
