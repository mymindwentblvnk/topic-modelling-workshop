VHS Dreams is the alias of UK-based, Greek-born electronic music artist George Dervenagas. Since his life-changing discovery of dance music at the age of 11, Dervenagas has made the curation and creation of voltage-controlled sounds his lasting obsession. Having worked as a DJ for many years, he got his first break as a producer with VHS Dreams' sophomore record "TRANS AM". The album, a revivalist tribute to the dance culture of the 80's, became a top-selling success and put the artist at the forefront of 2015's Retrowave movement. TRANS AM's release was followed with a two-year string of European performances and millions of Spotify streams. In 2018, VHS Dreams returned with “Lost World”, a sublime, full-length ode to 90’s Ambient House music.

As his consequential first exposure to the beauty of electronic sounds reached its 20th anniversary, and this century a new decade, VHS Dreams yet again expands on the stylistics of its trademark nostalgia. Now reflecting on the euphoric innocence and optimism of a bygone Y2K world, his music explores new anthemic heights that reflect upon attitudes towards our own emerging future. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/VHS+DREAMS">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
