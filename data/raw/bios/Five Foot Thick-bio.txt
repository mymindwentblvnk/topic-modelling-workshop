The band formed in early 1997. One of the unknown underground pioneers of the nu metal genre, had its popularity spread in the Pacific Northwest. The fame of the band was getting spread by live performances in local shows and by mini-tours that they embarked themselves, which lead in building a big fanbase over the years.

The band self-released their debut album Circles that was a really big success as an independent one. It actually became one of the most successful independent releases in Spokane history.
The band received well after that. They had their own sold-out live venues, played in the Vans Warped Tour, took a spot in the Jagermeister Music Tour playing alongside with Slayer, Ill Nino, Hatebreed, and Drowning Pool.

In 2003 the band signed with Eclipse Records and became the most famous local band supporting much bigger music acts that performed in Spokane. A few years later Eclipse Records re-released and distributed the album Circles in an international level, as well as it did with their second release Blood Puddle in 2003. After the release the band drew much more attention and began to have a certain kind of rise in the music industry. Had many more live shows in big venues and a tour supporting the release of Blood Puddle.

After a certain amount of time the band recorded and released their third and final album release entitled This Cold Life. With a sound that was much heavier than before, This Cold Life had a similar big success like the previous releases.

A few months after the release the band announced on their website that they were breaking up. Five Foot Thick had their final show ever at The Big Easy in downtown, Spokane on May 12, 2006. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Five+Foot+Thick">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
