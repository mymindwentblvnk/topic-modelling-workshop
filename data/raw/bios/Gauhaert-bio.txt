Raw Celtic black metal project from The Netherlands. Started in 2005 and released one LP Ygwaet Gwyr Gwynn Novi. 
The ambient parts that remind of Urfaust, which is none of a surprise since there are two members of Urfaust playing in this band (Dolen on the synths and Vloekwaard doing the guitar work and vocals), along with Zwendelaer thrashing the celtic wardrums.
