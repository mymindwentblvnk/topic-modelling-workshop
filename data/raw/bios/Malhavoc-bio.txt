Formed in 1983. Malhavoc released four full length albums: "The Release" (1990), "Premeditated Murder"(1992), "Get Down" (1994), "The Lazarus Complex: a Tale of Two Zombies" (1996). They released two EP's - "Punishments"(1991), "Human Fly"(2004).

Dubbed by many as the "early Ministry" before the industrial rock genre was defined circa 1985, their dark themed performance included now legendary stage antics of nude performance, body mutilation (scarification), punishment and persona characterization (MC JC).

Band leader James C has gone beyond his band's realm and on to collaborate on projects with Motley Crue, Monster Magnet, Dave "Rave" Ogilvie (Jakalope), Tool, Carol Pope (Rough Trade), Ariel and DJ gigs.
