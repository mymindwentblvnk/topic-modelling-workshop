Born as a son of a Turkish father, a Finnish mother and with German citizenship, Cem Oral was never far away from diverse music. Starting musical experiments in the teen years with 4-track-recorders and synthesizers he entered his career as a producer with working as an audio engineer for several years, then as producer for several hip-hop and pop acts like B.V.S.M.P. and George McCrae. At the same time he was already releasing records on Alfred Hilsberg's avant-garde-label What's so Funny About. Then there was the time to stop working for other artists at all and focus the own ideas, as the commercial music scene was not the place to be anymore.

Jammin' Unit stands in the tradition of Dub-production. Being influenced by dub heroes like King Tubby and Perry as well as early electronic music pioneers, he is one of the few electronic music producers that develops his music beside the commercial tracks of techno and pop music. This may be the reason for being requested so much for film music and remixes of experimental groups like Can or Die Haut. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jammin%27+Unit">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
