In the cold, beautiful Scandinavia in the small country Denmark, HELHORSE started out as 5 piece stoner, sludge band under the name of DØDNING in 2006. 
Experimenting with the sound the band added their second vocalist Mikkel Wad Larsen later the same year. 

The members are all set in Copenhagen, and come from very different musical backgrounds with a wide spread of influences from metal, hardcore, punk, and rock and roll. 

In 2007 they played in support for bands Black Label Society, Exodus, Opeth, 3 Inches of Blood and set out on their first tour abroad in The Netherlands. 

The reaction received at the various shows was overwhelming and fueled the need to record their fist self titled EP “DØDNING” which was released in the spring of 2009.

They will release their debut album For Wolves And Vultures in the late winter of 2010. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Helhorse">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
