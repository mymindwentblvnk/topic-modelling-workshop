Math the Band is equal parts Atom and His Package and Andrew WK. It's synthpunk using sampled Casio sk1 drums, paired with solid square waves and more BPMs than can possibly be considered reasonable. Started by a fourteen year old Kevin Steinhauser who was kicked out of his high school pop punk band, Math the Band, has been going strong for years, playing well over 600 shows throughout the USA, Mexico, Canada and the  United Kingdom. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Math+the+Band">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
