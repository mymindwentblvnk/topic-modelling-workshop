1: A staple in the Boston Massachusetts local music scene, and on the verge of creating an undeniable national buzz; whose work a day attitude and blue collar sensibilities permiate through heart pounding breakdowns, and poignant melodies, that speak of introspective visions of loss, betrayal, chaos, and world malevolence. Creating a high energy performace with such conviction, crowds are enthralled into movement through sheer will and exude an enthusiasm that is both refreshing and infectious.

"been doin this since i was a youngin. choping samples, playing instruments, combine sounds into on organic flow. i do everything out of the computer besides the mastering. i do not overcompress or quantize anything. i like dirty vinyl hiss and fucked up sounds. i believe music should have those qualities left in it."
