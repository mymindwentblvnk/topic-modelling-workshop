Flitting from hard rock to Latin to thrash to klezmer and back, often within the space of a few bars, the group veritably attacks their music with the kind of ferocity usually reserved for punk, despite having earned their jazz bona fides. “We’re all pretty serious about rock,” says saxophonist Ken Thomson, “and not just a token throwing-in of some different tunes. It’s something intrinsic to who we are as people. We’ve all had training in jazz, but we’ve moved outside that world into the rock world, to try to actually bring something new to that.”

Gutbucket was Born in the north German town of Kiel in 1998. Since then they have taken every opportunity to blast their in-your-face rock from any stage they could get on to. Shows in the numerous clubs between Hamburg and Munich or festivals such as the Wacken Open Air, Wilvarin, Becks Rockspektakel or Jack Daniels Rock Nights prove that they would go anywhere in the mission of Rock N Roll. Several German tours, shows in Switzerland, Austria and Poland, as well as opening slots for Bands such as Danko Jones, Rose Tattoo and Saxon plus Shows with like minded bands as The Awesome Machine, Mannhai and Smoke Blow followed in the recent years. In the summer of 2006 Peter Kaluza was recruited as the new lead vocalist. His rough voice gives them the touch of dirt and Rock N Roll that they need.   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gutbucket">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
