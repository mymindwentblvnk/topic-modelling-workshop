Little Teeth is what happens when you give classically trained vocalists a few folk instruments (banjo, glockenspiel and mandolin, among others) and tell them to make music from the heart. The San Francisco-based trio consists of Dannie Murrie, Sofia Bell and Sean Real, who — when combining forces — create a sound they like to classify as “orchestral noise folk.” It’s non-traditional, yet melodious and catchy. While their music might not please everybody’s ears, Little Teeth have found a way to gnaw into some of the hippest indie rock circles around the world, especially with last year’s release of Child Bearing Man (Absolutely Kosher Records). The self-produced album demonstrates their overwhelming vigor and skill, though never afraid to throw in the occasional growl or snarl. All three members play at least five instruments each, backed up with phantom vocals and an orchestral sound.

Little Teeth is based out of San Francisco on Absolutely Kosher records.
