Caput LVIIIm is the name of a one-time-only project created in 2004-2005 by various members of the necro-doom entity Malasangre with the complicity of Tronus Abyss' guitarist Mord, and the singer from the avant-garde extreme metal act Necroart. Since the beginning, the aim was to record only one track, a monumental suite to be featured on a secretly assembled tribute to H.P. Lovecraft.  During its 30 frightening minutes, "Resurgent Atavism" re-defines Electric Wizard's space doom style from an ambient-drone perspective, with more emphasys on the occult and esoteric component of sounds, and with a strong black metal attitude.
The project takes the name from an imputation against the Templars during a violent repression ordered by the King of France together with the Catholic Church. According on different theories, Caput LVIIIm could have been a Baphomet, or a majestic golden figure; a virgin, or a crowned old man; a be-headed creature, an androginous figure, or an aries head...
But no matter how it was depicted, Caput LVIIIm is a symbol that transcends its own meaning. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Caput+LVIIIm">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
