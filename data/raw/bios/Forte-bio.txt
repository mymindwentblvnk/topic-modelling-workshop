Forte was an opera trio act from Season 8 of America's Got Talent. They finished the competition in 4th place. 

Forte originally consisted of three tenors: Fernando Varela from Puerto Rico, Hana Ryu from South Korea, and Josh Page from New York. The trio met on the internet just a few weeks before their Americaâ€™s Got Talent audition. They kept in contact through Skype. They met face-to-face days before their audition. By their audition, the members of Forte had never performed together in front of an audience.   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Forte">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
