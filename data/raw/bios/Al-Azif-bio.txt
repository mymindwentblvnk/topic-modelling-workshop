Al-Azif:
**AKA (The Necronomicon) is a fictional grimoire appearing in the stories by horror writer H. P. Lovecraft and his followers. It was first mentioned in Lovecraft's 1924 short story "The Hound", written in 1922, though its purported author, the "Mad Arab" Abdul Alhazred, had been quoted a year earlier in Lovecraft's "The Nameless City". Among other things, the work contains an account of the Old Ones, their history, and the means for summoning them.

**The name ( Alazif) itself is considered to be the sound of desert insects Alhazred used to hear during his epic journey into the desert , Which he belived those are the voices of creatures from other realms

**Original tracks are composed by:
Mafia,Tarek, Nazem, Zinc
