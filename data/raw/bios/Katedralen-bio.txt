1) Katedralen was a black metal band formed in 2016 by Abezethibou and Statisk (later known as Ragnar√∂k) from Long Beach, California and Cary, Illinois. In September 21, 2016 they released their first demo "Thy Resting Place of Thee Children of Satan". A week later they released the split "Dismal Offerings" with Forgotten Soul who was changing their music at the time. Later a 2 song demo was planned to be released but was cancelled also around the time Abezethibou left. Later the band has gained new members and it was set to go nu-metal but never happened due to the band splitting in 2017. In Summer 2018 the band reformed with Abezethibou and a new member Lord Edda. The song "Aryan Wind" released on July 3rd, 2018 which caused drama to the band and split shortly after reforming due to political beliefs.
