"'Dregs of the World' kicks like a page from the book of new wave Johnny Lyndon." 
– The Noise 

"Bombastically catchy." – Northeast Performer Magazine 


Miskatonic has been described as "a potent mixture of new wave and rock and roll," "intensely energetic" and "Courtney Love on mood elevators singing in a sci-fi rock opera." The Boston-based band combines '80s synth and bass vibes, punky guitar textures and powerful rock beats with Liz Firger's infectious, melodic vocals. No wonder Miskatonic is drawing increasing attention from critics, fans and radio stations.

The band's first release (2007), "Let Us Entertain Us," received significant commercial and college airplay – and strong reviews. Northeast Performer wrote: "Miskatonic's bombastically catchy sound is complemented by Firger's sometimes delicate, mostly edgy vocals." The Noise exclaimed: "'Dregs of the World' kicks like a page from the book of new wave Johnny Lyndon." And, "It's damn near perfect."

Featuring former members of Cheater Pint, Calendar Girl and Ultrabreakfast, Miskatonic has drawn crowds to top Boston venues including The Avalon, The Paradise, The Middle East, The Hard Rock Café, TT the Bears and Harper's Ferry. The band has shared the stage with well-known local and national acts including The Dollyrots, Imperial Teen, The Acrobrats, The Great Bandini, and The Downbeat Five. 

In 2007 Miskatonic reached the Boston finals of the Emergenza Music Festival beating out hundreds of other local bands. In 2008 the band won radio station 92.5 The River's Rising Star contest. And in January, Miskatonic will release "Favorite Records," an EP featuring three songs that have been fan favorites at recent shows: “Favorite Records,” “Sudden Silence” and “Taunt.”
