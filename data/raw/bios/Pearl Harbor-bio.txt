[Note: as of June 2010, Pearl Harbor has changed their name to Puro Instinct] Sisters Piper and Skylar (and live members Cody and Jessie Clavin, ex-Mika Miko) make up the dreamy, peace-loving Los Angeles fuzz-pop band Pearl Harbor. Pulling together strands of light, synthetic pop with the unmistakable damage of proximity to Ariel Pink's Haunted Graffiti, Piper and Sky create dreamy, ethereal melodies not dissimilar to heavies of the past few decades (Cocteau Twins, Lush), but with the doomed worldview of today's California, fallin' into the sea, creeping ever so slightly in the background.

They released their EP “Something About the Chaparrals” in October 2009 on indie label Mexican Summer.

In July 2010 they released their second EP "Puro Instinct" on Gloriette Records, they also announced on their blog that they were changing their name from Pearl Harbor to Puro Instinct, http://puroinstinct.blogspot.com/, http://www.myspace.com/puroinstinct.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pearl+Harbor">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
