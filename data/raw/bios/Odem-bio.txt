The experimental act Odem came as a separate 'unit' after the split up of a death metal formation named Deviant Prophet in 2008. The foundation of the Project belonged to S.N. (Guitars), S.V. (Bass), and KH (Vocals). In the end of 2008 came up a demo-recording including several own and cover-songs, written during 2004-2008. In 2010 Odem concludes it's work about the first long-playing album. The title was "Rape your god and pray for reprieve!"

Stylistically, the band doesn't limit itself to a certain frame. Odem is about to maximally extremize the elaboration of the Self-Expansion dynamics, self-destruction, incarnated in a musical shape, vision outwardly through the prism of the negative perception. Odem is the Weapon of Deblindment.
