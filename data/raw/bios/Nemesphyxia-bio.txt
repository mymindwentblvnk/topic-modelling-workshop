Having recently shared the stage with Australian metal legends Frankenbok, these local boys are definitely the ones to watch out for. Hailing from Wagga Wagga and surrounding areas Nemesphyxia combines melodic death metal with various elements of Grind Metal and Technical Metal. With dynamics ranging from growling vocals and blast beats, to epic guitar harmonies and samples Nemesphyxia is a unique, yet still brutally heavy death metal band. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nemesphyxia">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
