Athanator is a Colombian Thrash metal band from Medellín, Antioquia formed in 1989 by Jaime Ocampo, Guillermo Alzate and Gioseppe Restrepo. The current members of the band are Jaime Ocampo (guitar and vocals), Enrique Ramírez (bass), Eder Zapata (guitar) and Juan Carlos Sánchez (drums).

Strongly influenced by bands like Celtic Frost, Sodom and Onslaught, Athanator was born in 1989 in a basement of northeast Medellín neighborhood. The founders of the band, Jaime Ocampo, Guillermo Alzate and Gioseppe Restrepo, begun to play music with the only purpose to feel the strength of a disorted electric guitar, the beats of a home-made drums and to voice with their music their feelings of a dark inner world full of cruelty and violence.

As of today the band is getting ready two works: a DVD with a documentary of the history of the band, videoclips and videos of their performances; and it's also recording its third album which is expected to be released in 2006. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Athanator">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
