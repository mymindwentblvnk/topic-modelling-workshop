Damian Hamada (also known as "His Highness Damian Hamada", or "Crown Prince of Hell") is the founder of the Japanese heavy metal band SEIKIMA-II (聖飢魔II), and the author of many songs from their early albums.

Damian left the band just before the release of their first album. Later, he made two guest appearances on their shows - in 1995 (Satan All Stars show) and at the second day of their final concert (1999.12.30 - Satan All Stars Day of the Ultimate Black Mass).

His only solo album "Shou Ma Kyou" was released in 1996 (re-issued in March 2001 with alternate cover artwork). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Damian+Hamada">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
