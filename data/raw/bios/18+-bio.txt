18+ is an American band consisting of musicians and visual artists Justin Swinburne and Samia Mirza. Having met at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Swinburne and Mirza launched the 18+ project in 2011 under anonymous pseudonyms. Their first recordings, a trilogy of mixtapes entitled M1xtape, Mixta2e, and Mixtap3, were launched online under the anonymous titles of 'Boy' and 'Sis'.

Much of the band's lyrical content concerns sex. Mirza commented on this: "I don't ever think the way we represent sex is explicitly sexy; we're not trying to seduce. We're playing up to roles we still see in music today." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/18%252B">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
