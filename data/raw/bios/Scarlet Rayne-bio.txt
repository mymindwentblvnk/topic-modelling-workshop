Scarlet Rayne was a progressive/heavy/power metal band from USA, who formed in 1987. Scarlet Rayne began with Daniel Johnston, his brother Matthew (drums) and Kyle David (bass). They recorded a 3-song demo in 1988 and were quickly catapulted into Metal Mayhem - Crash replaced Matt later in 1988. They toured Illinois, Wisconsin, and Minnesota playing gigs in notably, Thirsty Whale (Chicago), New Union (Minneapolis) and Odd Rock (Milwaukee). They have played shows with Sacred Warrior, Barren Cross, Bride, Whitecross, Believer, and Vengeance Rising. Their sound could be likened to Glacier (US), early Queensryche, Fates Warning.
