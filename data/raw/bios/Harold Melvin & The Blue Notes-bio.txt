Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes was a soul group of the 1970s, based in Philadelphia, PA. Led by Harold Melvin, they formed as early as 1954, but struggled for many years until they finally broke through in 1972, thanks to then-new lead singer Teddy Pendergrass. With the addition of Pendergrass, and the  orchestral productions that Gamble & Huff supplied them with, the group found success with such tracks as "I Miss You", "If You Don't Know Me By Now", and "The Love I Lost". Together with The Spinners, The O'Jays and The Delfonics, among others, they helped to define the philly sound. In 1976, Pendergrass left for a solo career, and the Blue Notes were not able to sustain their success for long without him, though they continued to record until 1984. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Harold+Melvin+&+The+Blue+Notes">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
