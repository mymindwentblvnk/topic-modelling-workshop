Double Diamond is a Belgian heavy metal band that plays solid heavy metal, loud and hard, but does not sacrifice melody while doing this. Due to a mixture of influences, no two Diamond songs are the same and yet there is this typical Double Diamond sound. The band combines sparkling technicality with heavy chord progressions that support their vocalist's wide range voice.

Due to the good response on many gigs in Belgium and Holland, the band decided in '97 to record "In Danger" (produced by ex-Scorpions' drummer Rudy Lenners). It received very good critics. 2000 copies sold till now!

But the quest in finding a interested recordlabel remained and only after a long period of succesfull gigs it took until 2002 before a second split EP was recorded with AFTER ALL and this thanks to Mario from Steelhunter Records
Also this one received very good critics and the first press of the limited edition sold out in a few months time.

But the recordlabel-quest remained and finally it was till 2003 before Alfie Falckenbach saw Double Diamond live and was convinced of their capabilities.
This lead to the first real contract with MAUSOLEUM and of course to the second full CD 'Stand Up And Fight'.

Double Diamond supported Hammerfall (Sweden) on their '98 tour in Holland and Belgium. They also had the privelege to support bands like Annihilator, Overkill, Tankard, Omen, Blaze, Primal Fear & W.A.S.P.
