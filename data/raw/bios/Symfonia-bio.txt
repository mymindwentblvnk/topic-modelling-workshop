Symfonia was a short lived power metal supergroup formed in 2010 by Andre Matos, Timo Tolkki, Jari Kainulainen, Mikko HÃ¤rkin and Uli Kusch. The band released its debut album In Paradisum in March 2011. By October 2011 last news were that drummer Uli Kusch officially left the band to continue recovering from his nerve damage which makes impossible for him to play drums for a year. The band did a tour in South America (mostly in Brazil) and would start to record a new album subsequently. By December 2011, Timo Tolkki announced in his official Facebook page that he will probably never record again. In his long text, Timo cited some problems during the recording and touring of the first Symfonia album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Symfonia">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
