Through a seven year history, Clagg have endured enormous challenges to emerge as one of Australia's leading doom and sludge bands. Building their sound upon a foundry of monstrous guitar riffs, a bludgeoning rhythm section and demonic vocals, Clagg have been persistent in spreading their evil word amid many setbacks.

Following multiple line-up changes, Clagg are now at their most cohesive and crushing. Renowned for their intense live performances, Clagg's massive sound pays tribute to doom and sludge forefathers like Black Sabbath and Eyehategod, while adding many unique touches which have earned the band respect from punters around Australia and listeners worldwide.

Clagg's third studio album "Lord Of The Deep" showcases the band at their brutal best, blasting their way through epic slabs of molten doom metal riffage. Quiet and contemplative passages of music give the listener a slight reprieve before the never-far brutality rises resentfully to the surface. The guttural screams and death growls of the vocals provide the perfect catalyst for the pummeling grooves laid down by the drums and bass, while the low-end heavy twin guitar assault stampedes solidly through colossal rhythms and melancholic blues leads. The result is a textured yet devastatingly heavy musical experience.

Sure to please fans of doom, sludge and stoner metal, Clagg carry on with grim determination in their quest to create great heavy music.
