Photocomfort is the platform for Boston-based artist Justine Bowe’s careful, expansive pop. After a slew of singles receiving support from the likes of The Guardian and Zane Lowe, plus opportunities to share the stage with Whitney, Beirut, Glass Animals, St. Lucia and Yumi Zouma. Her new EP, “Understudy,” is out now. Recorded in a cabin on Lake Winnipesaukee with help from members of Philadelphia psych-pop outfit Carroll, the EP positions Bowe as an exacting songwriter, producer and performer. She borrows as much from 90’s radio heroes like Alanis Morissette and Dido, as she does from Radiohead and Solange Knowles. Huge vocal hooks soar over nimble arrangements, presenting the self-doubt and isolation born from the pursuit of “the dream” of being an artist as harrowing, irresistible, and irresistibly catchy.
