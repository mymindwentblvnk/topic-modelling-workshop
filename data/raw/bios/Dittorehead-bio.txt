Hailing from Maldives, the band Dittore Head first formed in late 2006 with the line-up:
Fathy - Guitars, Backing vocals
Jessy - Bass, Backing vocals
Shammoon - Vocals
Dhai - Drums

This line up performed on the show "RESURRECTION!" @ carnival stage.
After a thrashing show, Dhai quit the band. With Shammoon being really busy at work, the band decided to take a break and get things on track again.

Then in February 2007, Lauzam [drums] & Thuhtte [guitar] joined the band. With this new crew the band jammed and brought in Eman as the vocal line of Dittore Head.

After a month or two of settings things align, this line up rocked-out the "DHUNGETHIVA!" show which was @ Artificial Beach Stage.

With a massive fan base forming and high hopes of winning, the band singed up for the "RockStorm Chapter 2 Auditions".
Qualifying to the second round meant a lot to the band as it was the bands 3rd ever performance.

Stuck between the band and his work, Eman had a hard time and chose to quit. So the band brought in Shammoon as the vocal line of the band again. Then after weeks, Cutter-Ray [bass] signed in to the band as Jessy was a 'temporary' member.

With this new line-up, the band electrified the crowd with a stunning performance @ "ROCKSTORM CHAPTER2!".

Now, Dittore Head conquers the local Metal Scene with members:
Fathy - Guitars
Lauzam - Drums
Katarey - Bass
Thuttey - Guitars
Shammoon - Vocals
Jessy - Guitars[temp.]
