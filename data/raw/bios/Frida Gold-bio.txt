Frida Gold is a German band from Hattingen in the south of the Ruhr region in Germany, which in various guises has been active since 2007. Frida Gold primarily performs music in the dance-pop genre with most of the tracks / lyrics being in German. The band is currently made up of: Alina Süggeler (lead singer), Andreas "Andi" Weizel (bass), Julian Cassel (guitar) and Thomas "Tommy" Holtgreve (drums). The songs are primarily written by the singer Alina Süggeler and bassist Andi Weizel. The band's name came from the song "Frida" By Axel Bosse - and early recordings of the band can be found under the artist name Frida. Subsequently, the group decided to add the word "gold" to the band name, because they wanted to have a double-barreled name and they felt that the word "gold" conjured up associations of high value, warmth, brightness, non-copy-able and cleanliness. The band is signed to the Warner Music.

On October 8, 2015, the band announced that they were moving their latest album release to early 2016 (previously expected in late 2015). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Frida+Gold">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
