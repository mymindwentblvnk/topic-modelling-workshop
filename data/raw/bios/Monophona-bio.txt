Monophona are Claudine (vocals, guitars, keys), Jorsch (percussion) and Chook (programming).

With two completely different backgrounds in music, Claudine and Chook may  have been an unlikely duo to collaborate at first glance. He used his teenage DJ-ing experience to make a name for himself not only as a turntable artist, but also as a drum&bass producer; she was inspired by the likes of Tom Waits, Van Morrison and Joni Mitchell and became a singer-songwriter, touring with a folk-rock band. He can spend hours in the studio tweaking a sound until it is just the one heâ€™s been looking for, building up a tune that speaks for itself and is in no need of words; she loves acoustic instruments, the touch of fingers on strings or wood. 
Yet, after having built successful careers in their respective fields, they were eager to take on a new musical challenge and search for common ground. The result of this collaboration is Monophona, a blend of two extremes, electronic and intimate, melodic and innovative.

On stage, the line-up is completed by percussionist Jorsch, equally at home in both musical worlds. He adds detail and dynamics to their live-set.

Since their first gig in the summer of 2011, they have opened for acts such as Rodrigo y Gabriela, Elektro Guzzi and Nostalgia77.

Their first single "Give up" is released in September 2012. The debut album called "The Spy" will be out in November.
