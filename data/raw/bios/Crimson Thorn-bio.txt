Crimson Thorn is a Christian death metal band. The band was founded in 1991 by members Luke Renno, Dave Quast, Dylan Jennigis, Paul Jongeward, and Miles Sundae. They were almost ready to record their first demo when Dylan left, and Luke took his place on the bass. Their demo was entitled The Plagued, and was recorded in 1992 at Blue Moon Studios in Minneapolis. After Dave left, Kevin Sundberg joined as the new drummer, and their style changed to death metal and grindcore. Crimson Thorn was signed to Atomic Records and released their first full length CD, Unearthed, in 1994. Later, R.E.X. Records re-released Unearthed. Paul Jongeward left the band, and was replaced with Andy Kopesky before the release of Dissection in 1997 on the label Morphine Records. Little Rose Records re-released it in 1999. Purification, was later released after the band built their own studio in the basement of Kevin's home. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Crimson+Thorn">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
