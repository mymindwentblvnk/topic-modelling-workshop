In late 2014, the epic extreme metal band, Dawn of Dissolution, was born in the minds of two face-melting guitarists from the most northern reaches of Houston: Joseph Marduk and Andrew Amon. The music evolved from idea to reality when guttural growler Adrian Socaciu joined the project. The trio worked together to produce and release the band’s debut EP, Nightfrost. Approximately two years after the bands original inception, the amped-up blastbeat machine, Cole Jones, and subsonic shredder Vincent Mennella completed the band’s lineup. Nightfrost was well received both locally and abroad, and it was also critical in helping the band secure supporting slots on national acts touring through Houston. 
So far, 2016 has been a period of significant growth for the epic extreme metal project. The band’s performance with Rhapsody and Primal Fear at Scout Bar thoroughly enthralled fans who travelled all across Texas to support the tour. Performances with Rigor Mortis, Abigail Williams, and Rusty Cooley’s Day of Reckoning were all well received by audiences and critics alike. 
The band’s goal for the end of the year is to finish tracking their first full-length album and expand their live performances beyond the borders of Houston. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dawn+Of+Dissolution">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
