Chaos Architect is the product of nearly 3 years' worth of name, genre, and lineup changes that have resulted in a focused sound and hardened determination to bring that sound to the masses. With influences ranging from Dying Fetus and Spawn of Possession to Dimmu Borgir and Naglfar, Chaos Architect is able to blend black, death, thrash, and melodic metal into an unrelenting barrage of shredding guitars, demonic screams, crushing drums, and atmospheric keys. Chaos Architect hails from Norwich Connecticut and plays shows in the southeastern CT area.

Chaos Architect is currently searching for a talented drummer, rhythm guitarist, and bassist to join their ranks. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Chaos+Architect">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
