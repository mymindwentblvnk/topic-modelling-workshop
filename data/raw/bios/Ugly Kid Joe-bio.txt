Ugly Kid Joe is a rock band which formed in Isla Vista, California, United States in 1989. The band's name is a parody of the band Pretty Boy Floyd. The band made a name for themselves in the early 1990s with their mix of satire and hard rock/metal sound. The band achieved two worldwide top ten hits with 1992's "Everything About You" and a 1993 cover of Harry Chapin's "Cat's in the Cradle".

The band released three albums, "America's Least Wanted" (1992), "Menace to Sobriety" (1995) and "Motel California" (1996) before disbanding in 1997.

The band reunited in the summer of 2010, performing at several festivals throughout 2010 and 2011. The band preformed at the 2012 Download Festival.

They have a new record called "Stairway to Hell" released on April 16, 2013.  Ugly Kid Joe started a joint co-headlining European tour with Skid Row in October 2013 kicking off the tour in Southampton, UK.

In February 2015, Ugly Kid Joe successfully used pledgemusic.com in a crowdfunding effort to pay for the recording of their next album, to be titled 'Uglier Than They Used ta Be', is the first full-length studio album since they break-up after the album was completed in nearly 19 years, 

As of July 2021, Ugly Kid Joe is working on their follow-up to Uglier Than They Used ta Be for a planned 2022 release.
