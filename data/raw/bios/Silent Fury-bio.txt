Constantly touring, bassist Joe Nasty, drummer Goose, and guitarist Mick have become one of the most sought after rock and roll explosions in the Northeast. They’ve recently shared the stage with Saliva, The Goo Goo Dolls, Bret Michaels, Stone Temple Pilots, Bush, Dropkick Murphy’s and Seether. Also have both singles “Love Stands in the Way” and “Girl In My Head” on the radio off their album Girl In My Head. Silent Fury has set out to take over any and every city, village, and one light shanty town in between. Watch out, you’re next. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Silent+Fury">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
