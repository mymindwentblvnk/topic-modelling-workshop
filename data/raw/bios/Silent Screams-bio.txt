Silent Screams are a 5 Piece band from Coventry, UK. They play what has been described as by fans as a blend of metal, hardcore, deathcore with technical song structures and no repeating parts.

Despite this chaos the music somehow makes sense as Silent Screams have had a busy last 2 years. Recording with Matt Hyde (Slayer, As I lay dying, Gallows, Slipknot, Trivium) for their current EP, relentlessly touring the UK and Europe all off their own back with no label.

Sharing the stage with such bands as: Bring me the Horizon, Emmure, Johnny Truant, For the Fallen Dreams, Your Demise, The Red Shore, Trigger the Bloodshed and many many more!

After Signing to Ghost Music, they released their first full length album 'When It Rains' midway through 2011.

In September of 2012 it was announced James Ryan was to step down from his position as lead vocalist. The band announced new vocalist Joel Heywood not long after his departure.

They have since released a new single with the current line up.
With a growing fan base, they're going all the way...
