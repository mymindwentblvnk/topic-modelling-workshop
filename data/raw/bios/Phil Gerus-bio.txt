Phil Gerus is an artist that seems not to sit and compose this sound, but it’s as if it oozes from every orifice, as easy as breathing almost. The sound is so effortless, and it’s not surprising considering his musical background. From growing up in Moscow where he studied classical piano; it could be that Phil Gerus and music are one and the same. Heavily influenced by his parents, particularly his father, as a child he would listen to jazz records such as Oscar Peterson, Bill Evans, and Keith Jarrett; these jazz vibes are undeniable throughout his music, and combined with his progression into electronic performance, create a breathtaking sound.
Over the past few years the 24-year-old has been banging out some impressive self-published music on the Internet under labels like Fuse Lab (“Milk & Honey”) and Rhymast Music (“Ordinary Things”) and is now back with his “Based On Misunderstandings” EP, on Sonar Kollektiv.
