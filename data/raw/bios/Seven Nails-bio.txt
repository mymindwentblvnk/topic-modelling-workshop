SEVEN NAILS - Symphonic Progressive Metal from Southern Germany

It's done - "Factory Of Dreams" has been released! The band's debut album features over one hour and 13 tracks of their unique blend of progressive, symphonic and female fronted metal.

Drummer Johannes Auer, bassist Leonid Reinhardt and guitarist Mathias Schmid build the foundation of the versatile Seven Nails soundscape. Based on this fundament, keyboarder Tim Lobitz and violinist Marion HÃ¼ttl add "symphonic" to the equation, with Marion also adding her voice to those of lead singers Daniela Marx and Julian Volkmann to create a unique and distinguishable sound.

A typical Seven Nails song is composed by Mathias and/or Tim providing the musical framework, with Julian and/or Daniela adding the lyrics and the vocal lines, while finalizing the song includes all seven band members. The results are atmospheric songs always looking for the perfect balance between progressive elements and captivating melodies. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Seven+Nails">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
