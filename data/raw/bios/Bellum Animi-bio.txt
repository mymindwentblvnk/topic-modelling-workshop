Bellum animi is a Dutch Noisy Drone Doom/Black Metal band from the Netherlands. untill now they released 2 demo's in 2006.

It all started at the end of summer 2005 when Sterf and Gornak started a conspiracy. Ergaesz soon joined and we searched for other members.

Soon Borthulaz and Frank were found but Sterf left.

After 1 rehearsal Borthulaz decided to quit due to lack of time/interest. He is focussing on his other things now (f.e. Wolversveen, Yawgmoth, Nuclear Winter etc).

At the recording session of 7 may 2006 Borthulaz served as session drummer, while Gorgulhir (Yawgmoth, Nuclear Winter) which was interested in drumming served as second guitar player.

7 May the band decided to have Gorgulhir as the new drummer.
