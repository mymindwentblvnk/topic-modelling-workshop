All Heads Rise has been around for over 5 years, playing numerous shows all over the Netherlands and in 9 other European countries, supporting bands like Death Before Dishonor, Born From Pain, Sworn Enemy and Death By Stereo to name a few... 

All Heads Rise sounds loud and aggressive.
Influenced by various styles of metal and hardcore, they combine modern day metal riffage with heavy breakdowns. Don't be fooled by the sweet innocence of vocalist Alma. 
Her vocals make All Heads Rise's sound even more brutal!

All Heads Rise is not your average tough-guy band. They are in it for the fun and clearly love doing what they do! 

Everyone's more than welcome to join in... See you on the road!
