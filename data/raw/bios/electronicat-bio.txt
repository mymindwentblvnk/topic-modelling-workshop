BIOGRAPHY

Electronicat is the alter ego of prolific French musician and performer Fred Bigot, whose work is characterized by its constant switch between experimental noise and pop music. 
Since the mid 90´s, he combines electronic music, analogue synths, drum machines, loop machines, vocals and guitars, all kind of ideas coming from his performances and creates a pounding, fuzzy, wah-wah distorted psychedelic electro sound that has become his trademark.
He worked together with other internationally renowned electronic music producers, such as Gerhard Potuznik and Patrick Pulsinger and employ the vocal skills of other musicians such as Khan, Catriona Shaw and J.G Thirwell (Foetus). 
He has released on a plethora of labels from Disko B to current hot London newcomer 'UpperCuts', has remixed numerous underground (e.g. Schlammpeitziger) and mainstream (e.g. Depeche Mode) musicians. In turn he has also been remixed by artists such as Zbigniew Karkowski, Kid 606 and other respected musicians on the electronic music circuit.
He has performed alongside such cult-acts as Adult. and Stereolab and been joined on stage by revered musicians such as Felix Kubin, Magas, Khan, Max Turner, Timo Kaukolampi to name but a few. His shows “of insane proportion” have gained adulatory praise from audiences and critics alike in the most diverse locations, from Beijing to Bucharest to New York and back to Berlin where he currently lives and works.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Electronicat">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
