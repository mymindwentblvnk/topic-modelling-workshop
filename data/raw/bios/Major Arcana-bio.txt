On the same label as Anonymous, an album of west coast psych folk, with Sigmund Snopek of the Bloomsbury People.
Additional participants are thought to have included Jay Borkenhagen (ex-Baroques), Tom Ruppenthal and Rob Fixmer. Jim Spencer, now sadly deceased, had other Milwaukee releases.

The opening "Western wind" is a terrific folkpsych classic while the rest of the LP suffers a bit from the aggregated weight of all the different genres squeezed in. The vocals are strong but sometimes overstated in that typical 1970s troubador style, while the flute ornaments are a bit, uh, effeminate. Neat synth arrangements provide the same lounge multiinstrumentalist vibe as on Bermuda Triangle; this also has the odd rock musical/art school stage project feel that's on a lot of these mid-70s hippie LPs. Closing acidhead arrangement of "Greensleeves" sounds like the Kaplan Bros could step in any minute. Great psychy cover art.

 This is a more complex album than Jim Spencer’s solo work, with a lot of moods for what is essentially a hippie folk album. It starts with a truly gorgeous song, and has several highlights, including the voodoo inspired (and sexually nasty) “Pappa Doc” and the breezy “Back In The Spirit.” Not a wholly satisfying album, and it has way too much flute, but still an intriguing listen with some ace songs. One of the best album covers you’ll ever see, too. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Major+Arcana">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
