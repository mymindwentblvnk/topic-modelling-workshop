Vimana is the name of three different artists:

1. Before the famous Gouryella name was created, Ferry Corsten and Tijs Verwest had already teamed up together for another project. Under the name ‘Vimana’ they produced 2 tracks together: ‘We Came’ and ‘Dreamtime’. In 1999, the vinyl release came out on Tiësto’s ‘Black Hole Recordings’ label with ‘We Came’ on the A side and ‘Dreamtime’ on the B side. 

In March 2002 the US based label ‘4 Play Records Inc.’ re-released the track on CD with remixes done by Graham Gold, Dace Audé, JOY and Dave Dresden (from Gabriel & Dresden). This time the track was not released as ‘Vimana’, but ‘DJ Tiësto & Ferry Corsten’ appeared on the CD as the artists. 

‘We Came’ and ‘Dreamtime’ are the only 2 tracks they produced under the name ‘Vimana’. The rest of the tracks produced by this duo would be under the famous Gouryella name. 

2. The name Vimana was also used by a Brazilian 70's progressive rock band. Members include Lobão, Lulu Santos, Ritchie and Luiz Simas.

3. Vimana is a metal band from Denver, CO. Featuring past and current members of Cephalic Carnage, Vale Of Pnath and Swashbuckle. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vimana">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
