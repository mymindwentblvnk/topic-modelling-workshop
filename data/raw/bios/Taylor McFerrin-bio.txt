Taylor McFerrin is a jazz/soul/electronic musician and producer whose first recorded appearance was as a background singer on “Jubilee”, a song included on his father Bobby McFerrin's 1982 debut album.

Moving on 3 decades, following on from a series of singles and EPs, Taylor released his amazing debut album ‘Early Riser’ on Flying Lotus’ Brainfeeder imprint in 2014. 

The album featured guest appearances from Nai Palm (Hiatus Kaiyote), Thundercat, Robert Glasper, Cesar Mariano, Marcus Gilmore and, returning a favour from 32 years prior, Bobby McFerrin.

Taylor continues to tour worldwide supporting the release of his album both as a solo act, and as a duo featuring jazz drummer prodigy Marcus Gilmore. In addition to headline shows around North America, he has performed alongside artists such as Erykah Badu, The Roots, Nas and Talib Kweli. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Taylor+McFerrin">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
