Starscream is now known as Infinity Shred.

When not enjoying a meal at Pakistan Tea House, Damon Hardjowirogo and George Stroud join forces to create music as Starscream. With an extremely diverse set of influences including bands such as Mono, The Octopus Project and Iron Maiden, Starscream create drawn out compositions that tend to be both soothing and destructive, kind of like when a distant white dwarf explodes.

Since first founded in 2007, Starscream has put forth three releases; their most recent, Future, and It Doesn't Work came out on 8bitpeoples in June of 2009. The following summer the band went on to support the album with a tour that included dates in the United Kingdom, Canada, and a week long North American excursion with best friends Anamanaguchi. 

Starscream has since put out two more releases. In January 2011, they put out a 5-track album called 'Pegasus.' In May 2011 they released their 6th album 'Future, Towards the Edge of Forever.' This 8-Track album was released both digitally and in a limited run of 500 Colored Vinyls Double LP.
