Gormathon started as a band in February 2009, by Stefan Jonsson (guitar), Tony Sandberg (drums) and Tony Sunnhag (bass and vocals). They began to write music based on the idea to create metal close to death metal and still maintain the melodies and harmonies that are fundamental to traditional Metal. In April 2009 they started to record the first tracks, and they put a lot of effort in recording the tracks on their own. In May 2009 they got into Studio Soundcreation in Bollnas to record the vocals, and later same month and to bring more life into their music, they invited Thomas Hedlund (Bass) and Peter Sonefors (Guitar) to join the band, and in June the band decided to release a three track demo, In July 2009 the band got played in Swedish Radio P3 Rock, and they also got great reviews in Sweden Rock Magazine #64 and Close-Up Magazine #115. In September 2009 they were contacted by Johnny Hagel at Bonnier Amigo Music Group, who was working with a new metal label. They sent him the tracks and he really liked the tunes. In February 2010 they signed a contract with Supernova Records Sweden AB, the new Metal label under Bonnier Amigo Music Group AB. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gormathon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
