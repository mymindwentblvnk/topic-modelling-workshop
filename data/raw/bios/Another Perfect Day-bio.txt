"Another Perfect Day" was founded back in 1993 with a classic band line up and was quite active in the German death metal underground at that time. At this time, the band classified its sound as a mix between melodic Gothenburg death metal and melancholic British doom death metal. Plans were made to record a debut album in 1997, but the band split up right before the recordings. The only audio clips left from this time are three songs which may be used as bonus tracks on future albums.

After the split up, songwriter, guitar player and singer Kristian "Kohle" Kohlmannslehner concentrated on his work as studio and live musician, but above all on his work as producer which resulted in opening the Kohlekeller Studios. After numerous productions (for bands like Sieges Even, Crematory, Flowing Tears, Benighted and Powerwolf) the idea came up to transfer the music of "Another Perfect Day" to the new millenium by using the new technical possibilities and with a decent degree of sophistication in form of a solo project.

In 2005 the two songs "The Lullaby" and "The Ghost, She Slept Beside Me" which marked the new beginning were composed spontaneously. The first euophoric reactions and finally the contact to Supreme Chaos Records were the reason for the decision to work out a detailed album. Soon, preparations for the release of the debut album "The Gothenburg Post Scriptum" were made, but it took 2 more years until all recordings were finished and all guests could be invited to contribute an individual part for this album. It was finally released on 30th of April 2010. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Another+Perfect+Day">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
