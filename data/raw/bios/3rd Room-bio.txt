3rd RoOm, latent thought in its founder's mind, are born in 2006 by Roberthk (founder old VII Arcano - and later co-founder of Theatres des Vampires). Just as for chemical element's elective affinities, he moves away from Theatres des Vampires to follow new musical inspirations. Khay Lenitas (ex Imperat Lenitas drummer) will take the hard part of the vocals, sweet as just a female can be, in line with the new music. The whole musical concept runs around the joining of classical orchestral elements with modern metal music, just like a movie metal soundtrack. As far as the concept is going on, Mr. MonTagnA (VII Arcano), originally recruited as second guitar to give more strength to the rhythm section, tunes down to bass guitar, thus keeping the established 4-piece line up, with Aeshla (Promaetheus Unbound and Lord Vampyr) still surgically sitting behind the drumkit. We are "SoundTracks for Visionaries"...The sounds-our feelings, the music-a window you can watch through... A point of view through melodic female vocals, poignant piano, stunning guitars and heavy strings.
