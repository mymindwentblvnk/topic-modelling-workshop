Nihilism Incarnate are a five-piece progressive death metal band from Preston, England. Formed in 2010 by vocalist Craig Forshaw, guitarist Graham 'Pek' Clayton and drummer Paul Aldred, second guitarist Dan Walden joined soon after. The band practiced as a bass-less four piece writing material and ultimately released their four-track demo "Ad Initium" in May 2011 which was met with admiration from peers and secured the recruitment of bassist Paul Little.

With a number of live shows around the north-west of England throughout 2012 Nihilism Incarnate have left every venue with new fans thanks to their unique blend of crushingly heavy riffs, searing harmonies and socially aware lyrics.

Recently released self-funded EP "Deconstruct The Aeons" was mastered by ex-Testament/Death guitarist James Murphy and opening track "Eat, Shit & Die" is featured on United Kingdom Extreme Metal's "Disciples of Extremity vol. 3". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nihilism+Incarnate">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
