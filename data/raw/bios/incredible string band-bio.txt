The music of the band ranges from quite conventional folk songs to innovative “art song” and hybrid forms that were a precursor to World Music. In 1967-8 they were sometimes described as part of pop music's "avant-garde", which had emerged in the wake of the more adventurous work of The Beatles, with whom they were compared. Indeed, founding member Rob Williamson claimed  that, as both The Beatles and The Rolling Stones used to come to see them play before they recorded Sgt. Pepper and Their Satanic Majesties Request respectively, the ISB influenced them directly.
Although they lacked The Beatles' broad pop appeal, the ISB showed a similar interest in extending the boundaries of their music. Both Mike Heron and Robin Williamson would break apart a traditional song structure, inserting seemingly unrelated sections in a way that has been described as "always surprising, laughably inventive, lyrically prodigious"While at times this resulted in a lack of conventional unity, it also opened up the song musically and thematically to allow greater depth and exploration. This aspect of their music, combined with Williamson’s soaring melismatic vocal ornamentation (perhaps influenced by Islamic chanters heard during his visit to Morocco, as well as by the Scots-Irish traditional singing with which he had grown up) made for music that still sounds fresh forty years later. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Incredible+String+Band">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
