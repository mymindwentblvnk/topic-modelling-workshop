Rupsband started as a project-band in March 2005, after Rups wrote many songs and lyrics for quite some time. As musical tribute to 80's bands, members of SAF and the Shining were found to form the Rupsband:
 - Richard UPS - vocals
 - Mike D. - Drums
 - ED - Guitars
 - Rogier - Bass
 - Mark - Guitars

 In April Rupsband started practicing. Early May we recorded a BGK-cover (Isolatiefolter) for a BGK-Tribute LP. 9th of June we had our first show in de Kortsluiting in Utrecht, which was a big success. Circle-pits, pogo's, bardiving, crowdsurfing and the likes in a crapped squat-pub.. Right away Rupsband was asked to support Direct Control and Fucked Up on their shows in Holland, but due to holidays we had to say no. We played a 4 songs bonus set on the Crustfest in Weert and went together for a 3 days weekend Thrash tour with The Shining and SAF, playing Leeuwarden, Nijmegen and Hoorn. Sunday 16 oktober we played in Parkhof with Brasilian fastcore friends Discarga and I Shot Cyrus, and the American Scurvy Dogs. December 2005 we played the Trashfest in Hoogeveen, with cool bands like Sin Dios and Narcosis. 2006 gave us shows in the OCCII and the Volta in Amsterdam, the Short. Fast and Loud fest in Heemstede and a DIY Open Air show in a Skate Park in Zwolle. June 2006 we recorded all our songs + one Attitude Adjustment cover. The first full 7", 8-Track-Thrash-Attack, is released on 30 August 2006, accomplied with two shows with Sick Terror in the ACU and in a squat in The Hague. Another 5 songs were released in june 2007 as split 7" with our Brazilian friends of Entre Rejas. Also we are featured on the Esperanza Grassroots-benefit CD.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rupsband">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
