Alice Boman (born December 2, 1987 in Malmö, Sweden) is a Swedish singer-songwriter. 

Known for a voice that some say is reminiscent of Nina Simone, Boman recorded her first EP, Skisser (which means "sketches" in Swedish) in her bedroom, never intending it to be publicly released. The EP was released on Adrian Recordings on 22 May 2013, and has since been re-released on limited edition vinyl. An EP containing remixes of Skisser tracks "Waiting" and "Skiss 2" was digitally released in November 2013. 

In June 2014, Boman released her second EP called EP II. 

Boman released her single ”Dreams” in September 2017. 

Her album, "Dream On" was released in 2020. 

Boman's music has been featured in a wide range of TV-shows and films, such as 13 Reasons Why, Suits, Paper Towns, Transparent, Trinkets Wanderlust, The Resident and Valeria. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Alice+Boman">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
