Movimento d’Avanguardia Ermetico was formed in 2005, sculptured within the lights and the shadows of Monferrato hills, countryside area of Piedmont (North Italy) between the Asti, Alessandria, Vercelli and Torino districts. The musical soul of the band is strongly inspired by Scandinavian and French Black Metal, linking it from a lyrical point of view with Italian language.
In the first tracks composed by the band riffs composed by Ans starting from 1999 converge, harmonized with the rhythmical approach of Yorda’s drumming and with the Elio B. lyrical assumptions. Despite the frequent bassists and singers line up change, the nucleus cohesion represented by melodic and dissonant Ans guitar and Yorda’s drums is not affected. In “Ignis” demo the singer is Yorda. 
The musical evolution is present but never perverting the introspective and slightly melodical essence. The collaboration with labels is discontinuous and passed by AMF Productions, War Kommand Productions, Algiz Art Productions, Kunsthauch Dunkelkunst, Slava Productions and now Natura Morta Edizioni. The underground attitude, the serious concept and the complete avoiding of an exhibitionist or trendy aim allows the band to separate itself from the musical scene mafias and the supporting posers. 
The lyrical themes slightly change during the years, but remaining in line with the philosophical and spiritual studies of the group, that is not afraid of dealing with heretical matters, such as the Black Sun, Indo-European heritage, antimodernist thinking and alchemical inner subtle messages.
