Ghaya (originally from "Gaia"), is the Goddess of Greek Mythology that personifies the Earth. It´s all the vital power of our planet, Power that is retracted in their music and concerts!

Ghaya was born in 2001 with another name: World´s Slaves. The first purpose was to be a tribute to Iron Maiden. However, after lots of changes in the line-up, a new way begun to be more real and easy for the band.

With band's maturation and experience, the ideas came to be expressed in wonderful songs composed majority by Chris Loveridge.

Back in 2005, three songs were interconnected and then recorded in a demo cd called "Fighting Against Illusions". Recorded with the old line-up formed by:

Alexandre DiPauli - Keyboards, Vocals and Backing Vocals
Chris Loveridge (Guilherme Lipinski) - Guitars
Rod Estevez - Guitars.
Felipe Ribeiro - Bass
Dionatan Santos - Drums

"Fighting Against Illusions", is a conceptual epic album, and shows a "Power Metal" side of the band. 

In 2006 Rod Estevez (one founder member of Ghaya), leaves the band and in his place came in Alex Tellini, a famous guitar teacher in Porto Alegre. Alexandre DiPauli took only the keyboards and backing vocals, and after a lot of tests Taylor Flamesteel came to be the new Ghaya's frontman.

The second release was a single named "Hurts Like Hell".


Ghaya, in general, is a Heavy Metal band, but they mix their sound with influences like Hard Rock, old Heavy Metal, Melodic Metal and Power Metal.
