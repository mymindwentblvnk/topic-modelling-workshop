Children of Megaton came on to the scene in 2009 with the release of a demo entitled NUCLEAR FALLOUT, containing three tracks and appreciated thanks to the unconventional suggestion of Dagaz, part of the Italian underground since 1993 and active in various different projects, from power metal of German origin to black metal (the best known being Ringwraith and Doominhated, as, for the most recent release, they were one-man bands). 
In fact, in 'Wasteland', 'Sounds of the Apocalypse' and 'I Am Legion (For We Are Many)', old-school black metal is married with traditional metal and industrial effects. 
Themes dealt with in the first demo (the end of the world, nuclear attacks, survival) are reinforced and reshaped in the 2010 album END OF ALL TIMES, made up of six tracks (plus an intro and an outro, namely 'Apocalisse in Re Minore' and 'Tomorrow Never Comes') where the sound mix is taken to further extremes. In fact, 'The Road - 3 A.B.', 'Nuclear Fallout' and 'The Shadow Gallery' are songs that recall the 90s, but there is also room for experimentation, as in 'In the City of God' and 'Aliens and Demons' (the only song on the album that does not deal with end-of-the-world themes in the strict sense, but explores theories on the creation of the human race at the hands of extraterrestrials and their interference in everyday life). 
The 2010 work was also well received by the critics and the public.
