The band formed in the winter of 2005 near Milan, by the name of THE WAKE. 
In December 2006, after some months of composition and pre-production, The Wake recorded their first EP, titled "CUMBERSOME". The promo cd consisted of four tracks of pure Northern style melodic death metal and it deserved very positive reviews by the European music press.
In 2008, the band changed its name into WAKE ARKANE and started up the writing and the pre-production of its debut album "THE BLACK SEASON". The cd was recorded from May to October 2011 at Marbona and Noise Factory studios, with the assistance of Marco Bonanomi and Marcello Mantovani.
The Swedish musician and producer DAN SWANÖ (Edge of Sanity, Nightingale, Bloodbath, Pan-thy-monium) gave his prestigious contribution to "The Black Season" as guest vocalist in the song "The Numb Experience". He also mastered the whole full-length at his UNISOUND STUDIOS in Örebro.
The artwork of the album was developed by SETH SIRO ANTON, frontman of Septicflesh and graphic designer for bands like Moonspell, Paradise Lost, Kamelot and The Foreshadowing.
The release of "The Black Season" will be on May 5th 2012 at Metalitalia Fest at Live Club in Trezzo sull'Adda.
