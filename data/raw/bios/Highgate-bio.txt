Highgate was born in late 2005 as an outlet for four friends inspired by all things heavy. The original lineup consisted of Jamie Porter on guitar/vocals, Chaz Burke on guitar, Greg Wilson on bass/vocals, and Steve Porter on drums. After a series of equipment failures, however, Greg switched to guitar and they began tuning ultra-low. Highgate continued as a three-headed guitar monster until Chaz decided to leave the band in early 2006. After little debate, the remaining members decided to go on as a three-piece, no need for bass, just two guitars tuned as low as the strings would allow.

Highgate entered the studio in September of 2006 and recorded their first demo which consisted of three blackened slabs of Kentucky doom. They have shared the stage with many great bands including: Ocean, Misery Index, Negative Reaction, Yakuza, 3, Apostle of Solitude, and Beneath Oblivion. Highgate is currently working hard on their first full-length album, which will be released on the TotalRust label in late 2007.

Highgate’s sound can best be described as a hybrid of minimalist doom, experimental noise, and grim black metal. An odd combination to some, but one that has brought the band recognition from all three sub-genres. Highgate are the harbingers of the Apocalypse. Their music is cold, harsh, and unrelenting. An outright attack on the senses and all that is “safe”. Not for everyone, but will give fans of the aforementioned genres an engaging listen. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Highgate">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
