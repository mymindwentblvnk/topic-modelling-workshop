Heibarger blends stoner rock, doom, death metal, punk rock and good old-fashioned rock and roll for a Sabbath-on-steroids type of sound. The band is a bit unusual but always a listening pleasure for anyone into the above sounds.

Heibarger formed in the early summer of  2006 consisting of Chris Highbarger (bass and vocals) Andrew Bagley (drums) Chris Sakugawa and Shane Brown (guitar). 

They formed in Boise, Idaho. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Heibarger">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
