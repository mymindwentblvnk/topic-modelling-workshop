The Havana Black Story is a genuine rock 'n' roll saga about a Finnish band tumble-weeding its way from Finland to the USA. With their debut-album "Faceless Days" (1987), Havana Black found a small yet loyal group of fans, while the press found another beast to pry on: Havana Black was "just another retro-rock band".

Yet Havana Black was to be the FIRST "another retro-rock band" ever to enter the Billboard Charts. Following their success Havana Black packed their bags and moved to the US.

The band´s follow-up album "Indian Warrior" (1988/89) FINALLY got the attention of the American Press. "The Finnish Indians are the most promising hard-rock band of the 90´s". Havana Black had spread its wings...

"Exiles in Mainstream" (1991) was recorded in Los Angeles and produced by legendary Eddie Kramer and Havana Black was booked for a U.S. tour supporting Great White and Michael Schenker Group. Due to unforeseen circumstances Havana Black soon returned to Finland and released their final Studio album "Growing Wings" in 1993.

Although Havana Black recorded "only" four albums, their songwriting, their ability to produce killer melodies and raunchy yet groovy guitar riffs with an extra punch was admirable. What they lacked (?) in quantity, they exceed in quality. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Havana+Black">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
