Brain Disorder is a solo project formed by musician and songwriter Trine Mortensen (This is not a band!, Nameless and Krompir Sastav)
It started out in 2008 with improvised instumental guitar playing various shoegazing melodies. The project is now splitted up due to the newer Krompir Sastav Project, wich is a lot like Brain Disorder. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Brain+Disorder">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
