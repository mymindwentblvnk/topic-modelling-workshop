Evil Wrath was formed by Nekros and Morbid in early 2005, to spread a vile message of hatred towards humanity and to create raw and unholy music. In this year, many changes occurred in the line-up, only to keep J.Destruction on bass as additional member. An album was recorded in 2006: "DÃ©faillance Monumentale", which is entirely in french. The band, hailing from the Province of Quebec, in Canada, signed with local label Morbid Moon Records in autumn 2006 for the release of this album. The CD has been unleashed at the dawn of winter 2006, by a cold and somber November month.
In 2007, a new era began for Evil Wrath, a new logo was created for the band by the master of logos, Christophe Szpajdel. Morbid now play's the guitar and the bass. A new warrior as joined the ranks of Evil Wrath's legion on drums, Zvord (Thesyre, Aufkrema, Revengence, ex-Slaotvean, ex-Frozen Shadows, ex-Decayed Remains). Two of the new songs feature a guest appearance on lead guitar by Amduscias (Temple Of Baal, Banished Spirits, Bael).
In February 2008 a split 10" with the band Pagan Rites was be released by Nuclear War Now! Productions, the split is available now. The recording of a second album entitled "Chaotical Invasion" is now completed, the release date of this album is not set for the moment. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Evil+Wrath">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
