Starting off back in Feb. 2007, Theories of the Apocalypse started off as a bunch of 15 year old kids and has become a force of 20 year old musicians. Having shared the stage with the like of Nile, Trivium, Immolation, Krisiun, Dreaming Dead, Rose Funeral, Epicurean, and Luna Mortis, they have impressed crowds all along the way. A live show that is just built on pure energy and intensity, fans have been made that support many genre's just for the simple fact they give their all in every performance. Music that follows no trends or fashion, just metal for the love of metal, using Speed, Brutality, finesse, clean sections, ripping solo's, atmosphere, and any other flavor they can to just simply make better and fresh music.
