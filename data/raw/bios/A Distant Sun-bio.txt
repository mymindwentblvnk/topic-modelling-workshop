Dark, Raw, Atmospheric and Aggressive. A Distant Sun are an Irish five-piece Black / Death Metal band espousing old Pagan beliefs in a modern world.

Formed in Dublin, Ireland in 2004, A Distant Sun have been a staple of the Irish Metal scene ever since.  A Distant Sun have been chosen to share stages with such luminaries as Anata, Thyrfing, Negura Bunget, Moonsorrow and Destruction and have played alongside their Irish peers Primordial, Mourning Beloveth, Mael Mordha and Gama Bomb many times. They quickly gained a reputation for their aggressive, engaging and intense live shows.  Front man Byrne’s trademark scathing vocal delivery combined with his intimidating presence on stage make him the perfect front for these Irish Heathens.

A Distant Sun recently released their first demo, entitled “VI MMIX – Mourning The Idol” to much acclaim, featuring three songs of Blackened Death / Doom Metal.

The band are currently in the process of finalising their second demo due to be released in Winter 2010. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/A+Distant+Sun">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
