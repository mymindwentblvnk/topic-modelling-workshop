That’s how The Morphean started in 2004 as „Bellerophon“. After some gigs, two demo CDs and a video, they entombed the Band – and a new, more emotional project, arose from their ashes. The Morphean was born with a new line up. The new songs were way more intense than ever before. They pushed all their ideas and energy into their first EP called „Divine“. This powerful output formed a perfect symbiosis of grooving Dark Metal and crushing Death Metal parts. The EP drew a lot of attention by the press and genre fans to The Morphean. Due to the postive response of the press and their fans at concerts in Austria and Germany, they took their project to the next level. In August 2009, the most brutal and emotional songs were recorded in Soundspur Records Studio with the well-known Producer Martin Zeller. He created an extremly athmospheric sound which was perfectly tailored to the style of The Morphean. Michael Haider of Alpha Mastering completed the sound to tell the fragile and hateful story of „Enter The Illusion“ with all it‘s facets. Another important step was just a question of time: the collaboration with Refused Records. After two years, The Morphean give a strong sign of life and want to fulfill all expectations and hopes that were layed in them.
