Bomb Scare is a four piece band out of  Queens,NY that plays a full out assault breed of Thrash Metal and various forms of Punk. Lyrics range from serious tones about parts of every day life that most don't get to see, their discontent with political matters; as well as lighter notes in insulting tones.
