Inquinok is an epic, melodic extreme metal band out of Seattle, Washington. The band was founded in the summer of 2000 by Krelian and had it’s first full lineup in May of 2001.

Inquinok released their demo entitled “Shadows Amongst The Moonlight” in 2003 which featured four very dark and atmospheric tracks. The demo received much praise from fans of extreme metal and metal in general and was reviewed positively in several magazine/websites including Metal Maniacs. The band played many shows before going in to the studio to record their debut album, including supporting bands such as Cannibal Corpse, Incantation and Sadus.

Inquinok’s debut album entitled “Entranced By Twilight’s Gaze” was released in January of 2006. Entranced By Twilight’s Gaze featured ten songs, showcasing great songwriting and musicianship as well as excellent solo work from then new lead guitarist Mordred. The album established Inquinok as a promising new metal act and a band to look out for.

In early 2007, the new lineup was fully realized. The band's lineup became Krelian on vocals & rhythm guitars, Mordred on lead & rhythm guitar, Kythving on bass, and Tormentor on drums. Inquinok had become more aggressive and darker then ever, partly due to the addition of Tormentors fast and brutal drum style. The band showcased their new material at various shows including their headlining of the Northwest Deathfest in 2007 and supporting such bands Mayhem, Nachtmystium, Wolves In The Throne Room and Enslaved.

As of late 2009, Inquinok has become a studio project of Krelian's, with him working on material for the 3rd Inquinok album release.
