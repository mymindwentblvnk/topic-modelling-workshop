Tragediens Trone delivers cold black metal from the heart of Norway(as always).The only release from this band,called "The Cold Depths of Solitude" surely won't let you down if you are fans of Kvist!!Also,it's worth saying that the vocalist of Slagmaur(Aatselgribb),does also the vocals here(under the name Skard) and creates all the music as he plays all the instruments;no,it's not a one man band..Sindre(Programming drums)and Gribbspiisher(Additional vocals)(General Gribbsphiiser - Guitars,Bass on Slagmaur)also participate on this project!! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tragediens+Trone">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
