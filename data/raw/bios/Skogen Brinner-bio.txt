The forest is on fire! This Linköping band writes music about social issues in a unique way. The music brings your thoughts to the Swedish prog-genre and their groove goes directly into our hearts history books. 2013 was the year when they released their debut album “1st”, including the song “Pundarvarning” (Junkie Warning) which ironically makes you want to gulp a beer. This “fake band”, as they expressed themselves as, is a must see in the late summer evening! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Skogen+Brinner">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
