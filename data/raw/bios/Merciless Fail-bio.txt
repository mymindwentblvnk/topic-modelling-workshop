Originally formed in 2009, the Essex based 5 piece began as a 4 piece thrash metal project, heavily influenced by metal bands such as Metallica, Slayer, Sepultura and Megadeth. The music soon became more complex, melodic and intricate and the influence from classic NWOBHM bands such as Judas Priest and Iron Maiden became more apparent, and so a more capable vocalist became necessary.

Today Merciless Fail's music can be described as a combination of many contempary and classic heavy metal influences, with the grooves, breakdowns and gutteral vocals of modern metal bands, the doom-laden, epic atmosphere from bands like Dio or Sabbath and operatic vocals reminscent of Dickinson or Ripper Owens.

Having previously recorded 2 well recieved Eps, the currently unsigned band's first full length album "Forged In Black" is to be released November 2011.
