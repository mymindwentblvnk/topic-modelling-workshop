Black Mass Pervertor is a Finnish black metal band from Oulu, Finland who formed in 1998.

The lyrical themes touch upon themes of death worship, praise of filth and decadence and visions of unity derived from pantheistic insights. The band's years of studying and experimenting with the dark arts and the subtle laws of nature has not only strengthened their artistic vision, but also given them a reason to reunite after spending years in hiatus, between 2010 and 2015.

"Following the herd and preferring safety over risk has never done anyone any good, leading only to a slow and regressive process of inner decay. From the get-go our agenda has been to try and experiment with different ways of self-expression as a band, never fearing to think outside the box to create something fresh."
