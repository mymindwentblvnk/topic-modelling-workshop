In October of 2002, Jason, Braden, Eric, and Ryan formed the original line-up of Timeless Memory. Over the next year and a half, they went through several different singers, band-names, and even music styles.

When their original singer didn't work out, Braden took over as the lead singer of the band. Once Braden began singing, they recorded their first demo with friend of the band, Jay Rexroad at Dreadnought Studios.

In November of 2004, they re-entered the studio, this time recording with Ed Fields at Underhill Studios. They weren't happy with our performance as a band on the cd, so we decided to not release it. Soon after that, they recruited Josh Clark on vocals and once again returned to the studio. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Timeless+Memory">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
