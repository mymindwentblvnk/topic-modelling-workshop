Just about the end of 2003, between Agropontino and the province of Rome, three lads start playing together. Their names are Fasano (guitar), Giorgioni (vocals) and Erkz (drums).
Their first songs take shape (one only still appears, at least for the moment, on today’s tracklist: Silhouette) and the pursuit for a bass player begins, quickly to be achieved after the arrival of Gux in the first months of 2004. At the same time Giorgioni, who finds an excellent vocal support in Gux, also takes up guitar duties to thicken the wall of sound of what will soon be known as TSUBO.

At the beginning of 2005 the drummer Erkz is replaced by ThrasherDemo... the band leaves their old songs behind and starts composing brand new ones. After few months the four take up the name TSUBO and, despite the short repertoire, they make their first live appearances without neglecting the rehearsal room in anticipation of the band’s debut recording that’ll eventually happen in November: "Promo 2005".
The band still keeps on playing throughout Italy as well as composing and taking part in various compilations...

After several delays due to force majeure, TSUBO manage to re-enter the studio in the summer of 2007 (this was meant to be in late 2006) and give birth to the first album "ANUS MUNDI", eventually released in early 2008 on the historical SOA RECORDS.

At the beginning of 2009 is released the 4 way split "GRINDCORE BULLSHIT" with ROTTEN VAGINA 69, THE ANAL TREATMENT XXXPERIENCE and DISCOLONY on the Malaysian DEATH MUTT RECORDS and an e-mail says the band will play on the stage of the OBSCENE EXTREME FEST in july.
In the same time TSUBO recorded (D.I.Y.) some new stuff. In December is out the split with grindcore masters AGATHOCLES titled "PROGRESS OF CIVIL ANNIHILATION".

At the beginning of 2011, the bass player Gux leaves the band and Manuel joins it in October as the new bassist in its full capacity.

In March 2012 TSUBO enter at “THE OUTER SOUND STUDIOS” of Rome (Necrodeath, Ephel Duat, Hour of Penance…) to record the new album titled “…CON COGNIZIONE DI CAUSA”, featured 20 tracks and many guests (one of them is Jason Netherton from Misery Index). The album was mastered in USA at the “VISCERAL STUDIO” by Scott Hull (Brutal Truth, Agoraphobic Nosebleed, Pig Destroyer…) and released at the end of October 2012 on the ukrainian Eclectic Productions.

During these years, TSUBO shared the stage with bands like:
16, AGATHOCLES, BRUTAL TRUTH, BULLDOZER, CRIPPLE BASTARDS, DEAD INFECTION, FUCK THE FACTS, GENERAL SURGERY, JUCIFER, LOCK UP, MAGRUDERGRIND, MALEVOLENT CREATION, MISERY INDEX, NASUM, NATRON, RAZA DE ODIO, ROTTEN SOUND, SQUASH BOWELS, TODAY IS THE DAY, TORTURE SQUAD, VOMITORY, YACOPSAE... <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tsubo">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
