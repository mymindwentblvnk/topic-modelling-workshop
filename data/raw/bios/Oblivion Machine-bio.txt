Oblivion Machine - Russian band which plays in Moscow right now. It was formed by two brothers - Alex (vocals and guitar) and Konstantin (guitar and programming) in provincial town Saratov. Officially band was born under title "Oblivion Machine" with its first demo in 2005. At that moment and till now their style can be described as mix of extreme metal, industrial and electronic music. After second demo which was recorded in Moscow Sergey "E_X_I_L_E" joined the band and amplified sound with bass guitar. With that staff Oblivion Machine had done several successful live performances. And now the band has finished its first full length album called "Unnatural & Wrong" and is looking for lable.

"Unnatural & Wrong" plunges you into the world of despair, hate and suffering with no happy end. It's not just a black image, it's about the very deep and heavy part of soul of a man, that can bring him into his personal hell and down to dirt and death, self-destruction. The personage of the album goes through the way of different choices, regrets and hopes and dies in the end. Watch him dying.
We hope this crazy combination of acid samples, heavy guitars and bitchy screams will destroy your mind. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Oblivion+Machine">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
