Dawn To Come is an instrumental trio based in Prešov, Slovakia. Their slow and dark tracks, evolving from small ideas, growing into loud and epic endings are typical example of sludge and post-metal. During few months of their existence, they supported Carusella, Rosetta, Rosa Parks or My Pollaris Artillery.
Their debut EP was released in first days of 2012: two tracks, eighteen minutes and almost no words. But if you’re Dawn To Come, you don’t need any words to express yourself. All you need is guitar with few effects, bass and drums with double-kick with additional production of electronic producer Teapot and mastering by Sandozz (ex-Dope Aviators). That’s something new in this country, but it still does mean, that it’s worth to listen to it anywhere in the world.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dawn+To+Come">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
