Laddio Bolocko was a noise rock band from New York City, formed in 1996 by guitarist Drew St. Ivany of The Psychic Paramount and bassist Ben Armstrong of Panicsville and drummer Blake Fleming of the Dazzling Killmen with Marcus DeGrazia on horns. Their sound has drawn comparisons to experimental rock groups such as This Heat and Can and free jazz musicians like Albert Ayler. The band favored limited releases, offering only small pressings of their original albums. They toured internationally, recording & releasing the EP As if by Remote in Europe only.

Though they never received a major label contract, the group was a favorite among critics and toured internationally constantly, often with vocal-less compatriots Trans Am.

After disbanding in 2000, Armstrong and St. Ivany formed a new noise rock band, The Psychic Paramount, while Fleming and DeGrazia formed Electric Turn to Me. No Quarter Records released the anthology of Laddio Bolocko in 2003, The Life & Times of Laddio Bolocko, compiling all three original releases for the first time widely available to the listening public. They were featured in a David Cross DVD entitled "Let America Laugh." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Laddio+Bolocko">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
