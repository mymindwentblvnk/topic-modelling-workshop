The idea “Immanent Distance” existed a couple of years before the band was complete.
Originally the band evolved from a split within Depravity (RIP), an obscure West-Flemish death/black metal band. A few members wanted to play the music they liked most.
It was only in March 2009 the band was ready to play live, thanks to the arrival of a suitable lead singer. Since that era the band played several shows and recorded a demo cd.
Immanent Distance is currently recording their full length album, so stay tuned for updates.

With a unique blend of melodic metal and sympho/prog influences they are ready to convince the audience! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Immanent+Distance">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
