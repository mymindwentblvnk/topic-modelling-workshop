Akae Beka is a roots reggae band from Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands, which was founded by members of the band Midnite following a change in their membership in 2015. In February of that year, the former band Midnite cancelled their 2015 tour and postponed dates "due to a life changing medical emergency, convictions, and revelations".

The band's leader Vaughn Benjamin explained that the name Akae Beka are two words that come from the Book of Enoch, cited in chapter 68, verse 20-24.[3]

Akae Beka's first performance took place in Denver, Colorado on July 17, 2015 in honor of Nelson Mandela Day. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Akae+Beka">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
