(taken from nekkrosis myspace)--- In short, Nekkrosis are a group of small minds from a small town, which has nothing to offer. Getting bored with the routine, we decided to put a band together for a laugh more than anything else. We were inspired not only by our favourite bands, but also what we wanted to hear our favourite bands do but never did. As the time passed we realised we had something worthwhile in the band, and began gigging with the material we had. After tightening our sound and becoming more confident in ourselves, we bagged better gigs, and took Rushden extreme metal to places such as Bournemouth,London,Nottingham, Birmingham and Leicester, trying to get ourselves out there. During this time, we managed to catch the attention of metal guru Russ Russell, who has produced and worked with bands such as Napalm Death, The Exploited, Hawkwind, Sikth, New Model Army, The Wildhearts and many others. After playing our demo, he agreed to produce and master our EP, so in the beginning of '05 we entered Orchard Road studios and belted the fucker out. A better means of distribution is now with PLASTIC HEAD AND CODE 7. EP available at most record shops. --------- GIG BOOKINGS ETC PLEASE MYSPACE: www.myspace.com/lena_ellson <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nekkrosis">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
