Some might say playing Female Fronted Gothic Metal in the year 2009 means to flog a dead horse. And indeed in times of innumerous Nightwish and Evanecence clones, which strain the forbearance of all genre fans, Sanity Obscure is accountable to the listenership to create a unique style of music and performance far off the beaten paths of all order of the day bands. Dark melancholic melodies, powerful catchy guitar sounds and symphonic keyboard arrengements, the extraordinary voice of singer Désirée contrasting to the enraged screams of bassist Markus are the fixings to an individual statement in today's gothic metal circus. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sanity+Obscure">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
