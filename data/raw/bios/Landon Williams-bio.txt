When one thinks of a singer/songwriter/guitar virtuoso these days, it's hard not to think of anyone else besides John Mayer. Add to that sonic soundscape, the aching vocals and harmonic pleasantries of Chris Martin (Coldplay) and you've basically accounted for the majority of the most influential and commercially viable (not to mention critically acclaimed artists) of the 21st century. Indie-pop notwithstanding, Mayer and Martin have pretty much set the standard for classy-intellectual-pop songwriting that simultaneously retains music critic cred, while still appealing to millennialist youths as well as the middle-aged grad.

Enter Landon Williams, an equal parts concoction of Mayer-shredder, and Jack Johnson purveyor of nonchalance with the Brit-Pop tendencies of Mr. Martin. Williams, however, brings a whole new spin on the singer-songwriter/shredder aesthetic by adding an insouciant edge to his overall sound that is decidedly more in line with the abandon that a few retro-indie artists have brought to the popular canon. Landon Williams is an artist who sees the future while waxing nostalgic, and that is truly a rare commodity. All you have to do is give his new-wave Opus no. 1 "My Heart" a spin to see how it feels to breathe in the Police and exhale Jack Johnson. Or perhaps you might taste the Brit-pop concerto, "Goin' North" for a dash of One Republic, followed by a main course of The Verve and Kanye West channeling Stevie Ray for dessert. MUSIC FANS IS THIS: pop in the buds, turn it up, sit back, and vibe with the leader of a new tribe called chill. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Landon+Williams">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
