Jim Black has been playing drums for twenty-eight years. Born in 1967, he grew up in Seattle, WA, playing music ranging from garage rock to big band swing. In 1985 he went to Boston, MA to attend the Berklee College of Music. During this time he recorded numerous albums, performed in Europe and taught summer classes at Berklee. In 1991 he moved to Brooklyn, NY, and has since become one of the most in demand drummers in the jazz/new music scene today.

In addition to co-leading and composing for the groups Pachora and Human feel, Jim records and tours extensively with diverse individuals and groups including Ellery Eskelin; Chris Speed's yeah NO; Tim Berne's bloodcount; Dave Douglas' Tiny Bell Trio; Uri Caine's Mahler, Bach, and Berio Projects; and Laurie Anderson.

Jim is currently recording and performing with his quartet AlasNoAxis, and his latest CD, "Habyor", is available on Winter & Winter Recordings. He also regularly performs with the collective Balkan-music-inspired quartet, PAcHORA, featuring Skuli Sverrisson, Brad Shepik, and Chris Speed. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jim+Black">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
