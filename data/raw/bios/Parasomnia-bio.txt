We are Parasomnia, a Technical Death/Grind band from different areas of Oklahoma. We love what we do and are interested to hear about any shows you would like us to play. Each member has various music preferences but we all share a common passion for Death Metal. Being previous members of different bands who knew each other, the guys from Parasomnia decided to make the music they have always wanted to, the result being songs with growing levels of technicality. If you want to see us at our best then come see us live!
