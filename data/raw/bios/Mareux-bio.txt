Mareux is a decade long electronic music project from LA based musician and producer Aryan Ashtiani. Releases like “Cold Summer” and “the Perfect Girl” sparked a cult following, particularly in Eastern Europe and South America. In describing Mareux's sound, reviewer Fabrizio Lusso puts it best: “Mareux‘s moody and strongly emotional electronic laden lo-fi approach straddles the line between synth-pop, coldwave and post-punk in a stunning and infectious blend of thick glacial beats, lustrous synth stabs, sparse droning elements, vigorous bleak bass pulsations and a superb passionate voice, flavored by a mournful shadowy-goth feel, a seductive 80s flair, and sometimes subtle groovy r&b inflection.” <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mareux">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
