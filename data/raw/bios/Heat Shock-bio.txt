Heat Shock is Thrash Metal / Crust Punk band from Russia. It was created in december 2011 by Alexandr «Tomash» Tomashevski (Рейдо, Рельеф, PEMGO, Azide Resistance) , Oleg Sobolev (Рельеф, PEMGO) and Ludmila Aladinskaya (Рельеф). The main idea is to saturate tough and straightforward crust with more clear thrash metal sound to accentuate the riffs.
