JANK was an emo/indie punk/pop band from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania composed of Lou Diamond on vocals and guitar, Ruben Polo on bass, and Sam Becht on drums.

JANK formed following the break-up of Downingtown, Pennsylvania duo Panucci's Pizza, which consisted of Lou (formerly Matt) Diamond and Brock Benzel. During Panucci's tenure, Diamond had been introduced to bassist Ruben Polo through mutual friends in the Philadelphia DIY scene, and they later met drummer Sam Becht during the trio's studies at the University of the Arts. After Diamond's other projects disbanded, they decided to start a new band. JANK would be a stark  contrast to Panucci's Pizza - in terms of lyrics, lyricism and instrumentation.

They were active from 2015 until their disbandment in 2016 due to accusations of sexual abuse. The band canceled all upcoming shows and tours, and shortly thereafter deleted all traces of their music on the internet, including all of their social media accounts. Their Bandcamp page would later be restored, and their music would also later be re-uploaded onto Spotify.

Their discography is as follows:
2015 - Awkward Pop Songs (Studio album)
2016 - Versace Summer (Studio EP)
2016 - Awkward Chopped Songs (Remix album; Self-released)
2021 - B - Sides and Dem - O's (Compilation album; self-released) <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/jank">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
