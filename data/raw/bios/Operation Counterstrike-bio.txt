In being since 1997, we are making metal because we are up for this!
Since the beginning there have been three releases which processed from Thrash- to Deathmetal. For the latest Release the whole shit speeds up and so we got inseminated by Grindcore and kissed by Joey deMajo the new creation - Botheration! Nine masterpieces, half an hour countersinking through the uptempo-territory to give an idea of our musical taste.
We do not want to reinvent the wheel, we just want to turn it faster.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Operation+Counterstrike">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
