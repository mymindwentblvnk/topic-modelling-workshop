Hookworms was a British five-piece psychedelic/noise rock band from Leeds/Halifax, England.

"Five-piece psychedelic rock group in the vein of Spacemen 3. Dense Wooden Shjips-esque grooves play repetitious host to echo drenched spiritual wailing and astral synth drone. "

"Hookworms fling themselves headlong into classic 80’s/90’s psych-rock like they’re trying to break something. Hailing from Leeds and cramming themselves giddily within the well established formal properties of the genre, they walk the scorched road behind Loop, Spectrum, and any other titan of two-chord songs who’s ever slowly wah-ed a chord until they saw colours."
