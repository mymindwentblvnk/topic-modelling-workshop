Kandelabrum is a Brazilian quintet with only a single demo release to date. Formed in 1999, their only demo consists of  7 songs with the original line-up of William Nadler on vocals, Rodrigo "Roy" on guitars, Nicolas Vergara on bass, Raphael Alves on keyboards, and Marcelo Coelho on drums.
Since then, the band has yet to leave native Brazil and has yet to record another release. They continue to remain together, however, consisting of a newer line-up of different bassist and keyboardist. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kandelabrum">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
