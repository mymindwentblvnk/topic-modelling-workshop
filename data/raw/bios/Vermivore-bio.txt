VERMIVORE is a death/thrash metal band storming from Oulu, Finland. The four-piece terror machine consists of vocalist Jouni Koskela (also in CLOCK PARADOX and ABYSMALIA), guitarist Jari Haipus, bassist Juha Haipus and the drummer Ukri "UgE" Suvilehto (also in DE LIRIUM'S ORDER). Collectively the quartet demonstrates the sound of a slightly modernized version of old school death metal in conjunction with the finest elements of global thrash movement.

A brief history tells that the Haipus twins spawned the project as a channel for all the bestial rifferies simply too ferocious to be left behind. The duo contacted Ukri Suvilehto and soon they started working on their first extended play. The line-up was later completed by Jouni Koskela who provided vocals as well as mixing and mastering duties for the five-song outburst of rage entitled "Zero Vector" to be released in Spring 2012.
