Freedom Fry is an American indie pop duo from Los Angeles, California, United States, composed of Parisian-born Marie Seyrat and American Bruce Driscoll.

Their music features minimalistic sounds and driving beats combined with various organic instrumentation - from autoharps and ukuleles to harpsichords and dulcimers. Seyrat's breathy, soft, French-accented vocals combine hauntingly with Driscoll's in both English and French.

Their single Earthquake was released out in 2012 via their own label Caveman Arts Society. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Freedom+Fry">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
