The new album, Black & Read All Over, lets the raw vocals of Sareem Poems gospel mix with the haunting voice of Georgia Anne Muldrow, up-beat rhymes of Pigeon John & Akil of J-5, along with a host of other prominent guests including Ragen Fykes who possesses one of the most beautiful voices in music today.
