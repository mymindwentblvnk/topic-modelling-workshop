Wim Janssens was born in Leuven, Belgium on the 26th of April in 1975. 5 years, 5 months and a fortnight later, Joy Adegoke was born down the E40 in Brussels. At the turn of the century came a crush from the distance: the first vision of a duet that would find its lungs in 2009.

Since that time, the pair has performed as Joy Wellboy, singing, strumming and sharing their love. Elemental beats and basslines form the center of their energetic sound.

Unusual harmonies and compelling melodies cut deep into the core and on top there’s Adegoke’s voice, uplifting, bedazzling, spirited. Sometimes she’s a knife that cuts, sometimes she’s a gun that blasts. But she always speaks from the heart.

Spacy Songs like “My heart ran away” and “Before the sunrise” , electric songs like “the movement song” and “On the beach” will draw you into Joy Wellboy’s miscellaneous universe. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Joy+Wellboy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
