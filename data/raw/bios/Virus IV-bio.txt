From their official MySpace/webpage:
One of the biggest and most challenging new acts in 2008 is the power metal band: VIRUS IV, founded by Samuel Arkan in 2006 with the talented vocalist Magali Luyten of Beautiful Sin fame and the Ayreon album «01011001 ». "Dark Sun" is the debut album from this outfit.
The band shows their affection for true power metal from the American continent, reminiscent to good old Vicious Rumors, Annihilator, Warrior and Warlord, injected with the new found élan of European metal acts like At Vance and Hammerfall. On top the band has been fuelled by the driving force and nu grooves of acts like Disturbed and Oomph! Meaning: it is melodic hard driving metal with a forceful drive.
