 Hidden City  has, at its core, an ever-shifting ensemble of musicians, instruments and ideas. On any given day the orchestra may consist of a lone keyboardist in the pit, this dedicated trio, or any number of  daily volunteer dignitaries.
It is an improvisatory, egalitarian ensemble that defies genre (sticks and stones may make good beats but genres simply escape them). The name of the group derives from the hidden city of artists who exist unseen, within the framework of American Monetary Culture. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hidden+City">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
