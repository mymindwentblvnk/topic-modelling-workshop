Ronnie James Tucker (known by his stage name Ro James) is an American singer-songwriter. He is best known for his single Permission, which reached number 8 on the Adult R&B Songs chart.[1] He is signed to ByStorm Entertainment/RCA Records and has released El Dorado, his first album under a major label, in 2016.
Throughout his childhood, James would sing regularly, but never in public.[2] He eventually moved to New York where he was influenced by his aunt, a former singer for Prince.[3] His love for the album Purple Rain landed him in a studio at the age of 19.[3] His skills as a songwriter began with the song Portrait, leading up to a credit on the single Use Me by R&B singer Miguel[4] after forming a bond with him on MySpace.[5]

James performed in and around New York with artists such as Luke James and Wynter Gordon. In 2013 he released his first EP, a three-part entitled Coke, Jack and Cadillacs. Each part represented important themes in his life - first love, first drink, first car.[2] The WP featured songs that included A.D.I.D.A.S. and Pledge Allegiance. It also featured Asher Roth on the song Lisa.[6]

James signed with ByStorm Entertainment/RCA Records in 2015 and subsequently released Permission, his first single from a major record label, reaching #13 on the Adult R&B Songs chart.[1] His debut album, "ELDORADO" was released May 27, 2016. It debuted at #3 on the Billboard R&B albums chart
