Gukurahundi (goo-koo-ra-hun-dee) a blackened death metal band with African roots was formed in late 2012. The project first started out as a studio project in 2008 by Nielsen (ex Stigmata Dawn) and Coluuci (Danny Tanner), but slowly progressed into the band today. The band then got together with Manicidic Records and started work on an EP for a spring release in 2013. The EP entitled "An Apparition In Nocturnal Splendor" was produced and recorded by the band themselves and released as a limited edition digipack and digital download. Since the release, Gukurahundi has slowly gained momentum in the underground scene. They have been featured on countless webzines as well as having the EP being involved in various metal magazines and radio stations. The band is currently writing material for their full length debut and promises the album to be a step forward from the previous EP. A few months since development, Gukurahundi has made their mark in the underground scene and continues to do so.
