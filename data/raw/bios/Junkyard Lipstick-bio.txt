Junkyard Lipstick was born in Cape Town early 2011 inspired by watching The Runaways and a ‘why the hell not’ attitude. They have been playing the local club circuit ever since.

Persisting through line-up changes in early 2012, they finally found their own unique style and changed their focus to writing heavier and faster material, concentrating on topics such as politics, social issues and gore delivered with a feminine touch. Their sound includes various subgenres of the alternative music spectrum but mostly in the thrash/power metal arena.

RELEASES:
The band released a few singles during their journey and in March 2013 released their debut album “Hellbent”. With the release of their debut album, the singles “Barbie”, “Hellbent” and “War” were played on various online/FM radio stations both locally and abroad:
