In winter 2007, from the ashes of Martyrum, Kim C and Adde started to work on a new projekt with the intension to make something new, yet bringing that cold, dark feeling to the music. After a couple of sessions with guitar riffing, they decided it was time to get a drummer and start to rehearse the songs. Several songs were already made at this point and a promo were supposed to be recorded, so we called our old friend Jocke (Dominion, ex. In Aeternum, Sorcery) and asked if he could play the drums on this recording. With no further hesitations he agreed to do the drumming, and the recordingsession begun. So finally the promo is ready and up on myspace. The promo was appreciated and we deicided to choose Battlegod Productions for the release of the full-length titled Torture Deathcult. Now we needed a drummer for some upcoming shows and talked to Mr.A and he were really interested in doing some skinpounding. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tyrant+Wrath">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
