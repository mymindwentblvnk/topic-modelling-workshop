Promethee started in mid 2008.
We play a mix of everything we love in music without focusing on a specific genre. Through our songs we hope to express the way we see the world around us.
After a year of concerts under our belt we hope to start playing more regularly so don't hesitate to offer us a show :)
We are at the end of recoding our first EP which should be released as soon as possible.
