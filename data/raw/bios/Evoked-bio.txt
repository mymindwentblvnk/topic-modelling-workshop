EVOKED is an old school death metal band from North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), Germany.

Founded in 2013 by "Bonesaw" (ex-Mania) as a matter of the heart, Evoked was for the time being completed with "Artilleratör" (Wilt (live), ex-Obsessör) on drums and different session bassists. In 2014 the "Return of the Dead" demo was recorded, followed by heavy live activity and the "Lifeless Allurement" EP in 2016. After some rearrangements and recruiting "Accuser" (Scalpture, Abythic (live), Wifebeater) as permanent bassist, the band recorded their debut album "Ravenous Compulsion" in 2019.
