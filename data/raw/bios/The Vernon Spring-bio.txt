Sam Beste is in The Vernon Spring - a happening which provides him with a means to explore sound and song through layered pianos, stripped-back beats and studio experimentation. This solo adventure comes after many years of producing records with his band Hejira, soulstress Tawiah, string duo Fran & Flora and others, many of which are part of the Lima Limo collective he co-founded. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Vernon+Spring">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
