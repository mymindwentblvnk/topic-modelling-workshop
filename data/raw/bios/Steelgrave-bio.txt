Born in 1982 out of Fresno, CA., STEELGRAVE was formed as the brainchild of Sid Dodd & Gary Zog. Along with Carl George (Lead Guitarist), Steve Rudolf (Drums) and Gigi Divine (Lead Vocals), this Classic Metal band came to be one of the most revered Original bands in California's Central Valley. Their pounding riffs, enchanting lyrics & pure onstage energy owe to influences such as Iron Maiden, UFO, Nazareth, Ozzy Osbourne, Metallica and Judas Priest. They disbanded in the mid 1990s, and reformed in 2005.

Classic Line-Up:
Sid Dodd- Bass
Gary Zog- Rhythm Guitar
Carl George- Lead Guitar, Backup Vocals
Steve Rudolf- Drums
Gigi Divine- Lead Vocals

In 2009, the line-up changed when new Lead Vocalist Wayne Hamilton came on board. With the release of their first CD in 2010, STEELGRAVE has reached new heights of performance showmanship, lyrical content, and onstage charisma- as shown in such powerful songs as the popular "Take My Hand", the powerful "Down We Fall", and the gritty "Death's Dark Shadow". Once again, STEELGRAVE is prepared to decimate the opposition in their quest to get to the top!

Current Line-Up:
Sid "The Vicious One" Dodd- Bass, Vocals
Carl "Master Axe" George- Lead Guitar, Vocals
Gary "Shadow Man" Zog- Rhythm Guitar
"Drummer Steve" Rudolf- Drums
Wayne "The Minister" Hamilton- Lead Vocals <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Steelgrave">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
