LORD SYMPHONY was formed on December 31st, 2005. Our genre is Epic Power Metal, a style which is like an endangered species in our beloved Country Indonesia. Our “dream” is to “resurrect” Power Metal genre in Indonesia which is currently “avoided” by common Indonesian metal bands, our musical style is a mix between common European Power Metal style and our own style blended with traditional elements of Indonesia traditional music.


LORD SYMPHONY is:
-        Arif (Vocal)
-        Fuad (Guitar)
-        Fa’i (Guitar)
-        Dani (Keyboard)
-        Black (Bass)
-        Uji (Drums)

 
Our highest achievement (yet) was when we were selected as the opening band for HELLOWEEN – HELLISHROCK TOUR 2008 in Jakarta, Indonesia.
