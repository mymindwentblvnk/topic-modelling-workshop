Band - BATTALIONS: 
From: Kingston upon Hull, United Kingdom
Plays: Down tuned heavy rock with extreme vocals. We would call it sludge but we like the older stuff.

Hull, known to some as the worst place to live in the UK, a dead end for travellers and a miserable city that was bombed into oblivion by the Nazi's and has since then struggled it's way out of post war depression; is home to the band Battalions. 

A four piece band, that once comprised of Kristian Barford on drums and Andrew 'Half Deaf' McClatchie back when the band formed in 2010. Since then, Battalions forged their sound, played local shows with great vehemence, sometimes to nobody at all, sometimes to a couple of hundred people. Clatch and Barford no longer play in the band; Clatch's Blues career as a solo player took a huge turn on the onwards and upwards direction as did Barford's professional career and since had to relocate.

Enter Matt Walker (drums) and Mark Wood (guitar). Matt Dennett on bass was an original member along with Peter and Phil, but during the transitional period between changing the guitarist and drummer, Dennett was out. It was evident that the band needed the edge that Dennett provided in order to keep the Battalions sound and re-joined, thus completing the line-up, which is:

Phil Wilkinson - Vocals
Peter Cross - Guitar
Matt Walker - Drums
Matt Dennett - Lead Bass

Battalions are attacking the underground scene with a renewed vigour with their debut album 'Nothing to Lose.' Recorded at the renowned Skyhammer Studios with Chris Fielding of Conan, Battalions embody the mantra of 'Nothing to Lose', in every sense of the term. Since the album was released and toured, Mark Wood has now stepped down from the band, with Battalions continuing as a four piece as they have many times in the past. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Battalions">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
