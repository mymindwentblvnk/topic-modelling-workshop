Luthien project was born in the winter of 2006.
Luthien has evolved during the first year influenced by metal music, creating a unique sound mixing the aggressivity of thrash and melodic death metal, with a more classic and gothic sound. The result is a personal mix in which lives together growling and female vocals, raging guitars and acoustic parts, creating immediate songs.
The 24th of November 2007, for the opening act for the Fabio Lione Band show at Siddharta (the singer of Rhapsody of Fire) Alpha is out, first promo of the band, released absolutely free and downloadable either in this site.
Luthienâ€™s 2008 is about new songwriting and Alpha live promotion. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Luthien">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
