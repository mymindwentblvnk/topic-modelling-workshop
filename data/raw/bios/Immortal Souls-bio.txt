Immortal Souls is a melodic death metal band from Finland. Back in 1991 Immortal Souls was formed and until now they were known as one of the best kept secrets of the cold north. Immortal Souls plays fast paced, aggressive melodic death metal (self-described as Winter Metal) that is compared to bands such as Dark Tranquillity, Children of Bodom and older In Flames, yet without being a clone of any of these bands.

After some demos and EP's the first full-length album 'Under The Northern Sky' was released in 2001. The album was received very well by both the press and the fans.

Released in 2003, 'Ice Upon The Night' is the album that made Immortal Souls known to both sides of the Atlantic. It was released Europe by Fear Dark records and in North America by Facedown records, where it sold nearly 5,000 copies so far. After the release Immortal Souls toured Europe twice, playing festivals and clubs in Germany, Holland, Switzerland, Belgium and Norway. And of course they also played the famous Tuska Festival in Finland.

To please the fans who didn’t get hold of their older releases, Fear Dark re-released the complete history of Immortal Souls on ‘Once Upon A Time In The North’. This special 2-CD digipack includes their complete debut-cd ‘Under The Northern Sky’, their two sold-out ep’s ‘Divine Wintertime’ and ‘The Cleansing’ and some rare demo-tracks. Together with the old material two new songs can be found on this double-album.

In 2007, Immortal Souls signed a new recording contract with Dutch label Dark Balance Records, which would handle its future releases in Europe. The band also released 'Wintereich', their third full-length album. The album is a four-part concept album and has been well-received by fans thus far. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Immortal+Souls">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
