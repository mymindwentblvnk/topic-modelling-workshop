Dylan Sitts is a Brooklyn based producer. His interest in music began at a young age - playing drums and trumpet in elementary school. However, his focus shifted towards production as he got a bit older. Dylan started producing in Garage Band in eighth grade - where he would try to recreate some of his favorite rap beats. Years of practice have evolved into a unique style that fuses catchy melodies, retrofitted samples, hard drums, and unexpected drops. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dylan+Sitts">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
