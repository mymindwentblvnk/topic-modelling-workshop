Viento Nokturno is a one woman band created by Malditanokt... Malditanokt herself gathered this memories and nokturne dreams.. . within the cold embrace, upon scars of memories of sorrow and hatred towards the enemies to musical art of black metal to keep what was falling.. into the reality of pure dark,  solitude forever and hate to the heart. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Viento+Nokturno">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
