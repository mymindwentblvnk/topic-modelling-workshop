There is more than one artist with this name:


1) ＣＲＡＺＥ was a Japanese rock band consisting of vocalist TUSK (Tasuka Itaya, 板谷祐;  ex Zi:Kill) guitarist CIPHER (Ichiro Takigawa, 瀧川一郎; ex D'ERLANGER) bassist Seiichi Iida (飯田成一; ex Zi:Kill) and drummer Tetsu Kikuchi (菊地哲; ex D'ERLANGER, Zi:Kill). Due to the previous activity of the bandmates, Craze's early material followed a visual kei theme, although their visual image lessened as time went on. Craze also had some mild popularity throughout their time together, occasionally breaking the Japanese Oricon charts. They played their final live without TUSK on 9 January 2006.


2) DJ Craze (Arith Delgado) is a DJ who plays hip hop, breaks, drum n bass, and practices turntablism. He is the only solo DJ in history to claim the World DMC Champion trophy 3 times consecutively. Originally from Nicaragua, he now resides in Miami, Florida. The style of his music carries many of his past musical influences. Initially influenced by the Miami Bass movement when he was younger, Craze has gone on to incorporate elements of hip-hop, drum n bass, and breaks in his turntable routines. Recently, Craze has shifted his emphasis to DJ'ing and producing drum n bass with his own record label "Cartel".
