Andrew refers to a few different musicians.

(1) An icelandic psychedelic act from the early 70's. One album produced in 1973 called Woops: http://rateyourmusic.com/artist/andrew_f1. "Reissue of sole album by Icecross related band from Iceland. Heavy psych rock from 1973 with wild acid guitar runs and English vocals similar in places to Blue Cheer but with a European flavour. Includes some nice instrumentation (harpsichord, horns, etc) and some tasty prog touches. Impossible to find as an original but now re-issued as a limited pressing on Breeders Backtrack."
