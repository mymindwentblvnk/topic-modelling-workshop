Formed in 1998 by Tomas Andersson (vocals / guitars) and Pontus Sjsten (vocals / drums) DENATA began their infernal sessions and with a big laugh their s/t vinyl EP was recorded as a tribute to the old school scene. What was a project became a band in 1999 as they hooked up with Roger Blomberg (bass).

After months of serious rehearsing DENATA was ready to record their first opus. With full force the band entered Guja studio (Linkping Sweden) in the year of 2000. Containing ten tracks of raw and furious thrash metal, Departed to hell was appreciated by metal fans all over the world.

In the year of 2001 DENATA was signed by Arctic music group and the second full-length entitled Deathtrain was released. With darker and faster material and a bit different sound this was the rawest release to date. Deathtrain were mostly appreciated in the underground scene but far to be the weakest.

DENATA suffered a setback in September of 2002 when Pontus Sjsten was forced out due serious damage to his ears. The band quickly re-grouped, enlisting ke Danielsson on the drum stool and maneuvering Tomas Andersson to take on all lead vocal responsibilities.

DENATA Swedens raging thrash inferno is back with a new masterpiece entitled Art of the insane. The new album is not just another DENATA release, Art of the insane is the most violent and well produced material composed by these Swedish thrashers. Inspired by the 80s thrash / death scene they will blow your head away with furious and uncompromising metal. Let the torture begin.

For Art of the Insane the band entered studio Hellsmell to get new impressions and another sound than on their previous releases. Art of the Insaneï¿½ is the most violent and well produced material composed by these Swedish thrashers. Tracks such as Marionettes of death, Insomnia and Prophecies will take you through eons of pain, this is the art of the insane. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Denata">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
