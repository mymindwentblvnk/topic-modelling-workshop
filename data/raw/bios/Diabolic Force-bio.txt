DIABOLIC FORCE was a very young band, which dreamed from the old 80s Death / Thrash times! They were founed in 2001, and knew well how VENOM; HELLHAMMER and BULLDOZER sounded in the old times! On their album, which is only released in vinyl, they mix this styles well together! The recording sounds also like in the old times, but could have been a bit better, without destroying the cult factor! They have of course also "old school" names, like Bestial Killer (drumms), Whip Striker (bass, vocals) and Poison Hell (guitar)! The cover reminds me of the the first MUTILATOR album, but sadly the new "Dark Sun" label could not manufacture the great embossed silver print! Seems the band has split in 2004.
