Formation and Early Days (1999-2000) 
Artcell (আর্টসেল) is a progressive metal band of Bangladesh. The band is arguably the first progressive metal band of the country and usually experiments with tunes from other metal genres such as grunge and thrash.

The current band members were school friends in Dhaka. Ershad Zaman (1999-2017) used to be the guitarist of a band named Tantrik back in 1999. Vocalist, Lincoln De Costa (1999-present), joined Tantrik just before the group disbanded. They were looking for a bassist and a drummer when through friends, they met Saef Al Nazi Cezanne (1999-present) and Kazi Shazzadul Asheqeen Shaju (1999-present). 
The members later renamed their band to Artcell in August 1999 and the band was officially formed in November 1999.

Artcell performed in many "underground" rock concerts, many of which were organized by various online forums and IRC groups such as BDPunks, AmaderGaan and AlterBD. 


 Onno Somoy (2000–2002) 
Artcell released their first studio album অন্য সময় (Other Time) in 2002 by G-Series. The band lost its main songwriter Rupok to cerebral malaria while working on this album. The album was dedicated to him. One of the songs was titled "রুপক একটি গান (Rupok A Song)" in his memory.

 Oniket Prantor (2002–2006) 
Their second studio album "Oniket Prantor (No man's land)" was released in April 2006. 
"Oniket Prantor (No man's land)", the album's title track, is Artcell's longest (16 minutes and 20 seconds) and most popular song to date. The album was one of the top sellers of the year.


 2007-2019 
On 9 January 2012, Artcell announced the release of their third album and confirmed that it would be released by the end of the year. They posted on their Facebook page: "This is to inform all Artcell fans and friends who have been waiting for our 3rd album, wait just for a few more months and Hopefully you won't be disappointed" (Shortened).
