Allah-Las are an American rock band from Los Angeles, California, formed in 2008 around a mutual love for records, Los Angeles history, and the beach. The band members are all surfers and cover the city from the East Side (Mt. Washington) to way out West (Venice Beach) - and their sound reflects the geography of the city. The group consists of Miles Michaud, singer and guitarist, Pedrum Siadatian, electric guitar and vocals, Spencer Dunham, Electric Bass and vocals, and Matthew Correia, drums, percussion and vocals.

Since coming together as a band, they cut their teeth playing numerous California dates with groups like Entrance Band, Tyde, Tijuana Panthers, and the Growlers, and have garnered the approval of original UK Psych founding-father Patrick Campbell-Lyons (Nirvana). In the Los Angeles musical community, they gained a reputation as a laid-back, grooving band with strong ties to the authentically LA-centric sounds of bands like the Byrds, Love, and early Captain Beefheart. 

The group released their third album, Calico Review, on September 9, 2016. On November 3, 2017, the band released the EP Covers #1. The EP consists of four covers of songs by George Harrison, Television, Kathy Heideman, and Further. In October 2019, the band released the album LAHS.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Allah-Las">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
