Moondust is an alternative rock band from Vilnius, Lithuania, formed in 2006. Since the very beginning Moondust had a number of shows and became known in Lithuanian scene by their harsh alternative sound and Seattle-like vibe. 

In 2007 Moondust founded their own recording studio, where they recorded some demo tracks. This made an opportunity for the band to contact other musicians from neighbouring countries and play shows in Latvian, Estonian clubs and festivals. Local bands such as “Gyvai”, “IR”, “Serum” have also recorded some songs in the same studio.

Moondust actively toured till the summer of 2009 when they finally started recording their debut album “22.23”. The recording sessions ended just before the New Year. Because of the preparations for an album release, Moondust hasn’t been active till the spring of 2010. 

On March the 13th 2010 Moondust releases their independent album “22.23” followed by the single “Wonderland”.
