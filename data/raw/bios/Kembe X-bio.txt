With The Addition Of The Rap Collage Known As Swag Village Kembe has found new success but still is on his journey for that Fame he deserves

O.G. cold bar spitter of Swag Village.. mastermind behind the songs "I B Fuckin Nuns" and "No Fat Chicks" (which he produced, and wrote/spit the hook). Known for his captivating voice, clever lyrics and smooth, slapstick delivery, Kembe graces tracks with his presence and sets them ablaze. Loses bitches at an astounding rate, and pulls them at a feeble one. Co Founder of Xandercast, with Jody Duff of LOUDED. If only Kembe could get some fucking management, and production, he'd be on his way up.. but he's yet to find such love. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kembe+X">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
