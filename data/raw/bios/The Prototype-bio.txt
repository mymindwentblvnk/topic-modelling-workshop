The Prototype AKA Liverpool’s Kevin Williams is, at the age 20, already a seasoned producer. Cutting his teeth in the UK Hardcore scene back in 2005, he saw his first release at fifteen years old and since moving into the areas of House and Dubstep, has spent time in the studio with Wiley, achieved Radio 1, 1xtra and Juice FM airplay and remixed for up-and-coming acts such as Natisse, KOF and Staffy & Maverick.

The Prototype also has a massive online following via twitter, facebook and youtube with his recent bootleg mix of “One” by Swedish House Mafia racking up close to 1 million hits. In addition to this he also uses Youtube as a platform from which to share his tips, skill and resources with less experienced producers, delivering lessons and ‘How To’ information, garnered from his five years behind the production desk. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Prototype">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
