Hailing from the Black Mountain district in the South West part of France, Wardanz consists of four Metal Kids: Singer/guitarist Kévin Total founded the band in 2005 and was later joined by drummer Ben Bourdil, bassist Manu Hernandez and second axeman Jeremy Tralero. 

They play a highly polished traditional Heavy Metal with astounding musicianship, their very own, with some great Metal covers during their Hellraising shows! 

So during the last Two years their live performances caused a big buzz in the circuits around Toulouse( Havana café, KamazRock Festival ) 

Recently, the band parted company with drummer to greet in their ranks Léo Margarit who is now also drumming for famous metal progsters[artist Pain of Salvation[/artist].
