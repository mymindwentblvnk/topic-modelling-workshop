1. Conspirator is Marc Brownstein and Aron Magner (Disco Biscuits) along with electronic music/production guru Omen (Final Phaze NYC), and the trio teams up for some awe-inspiring trance, down tempo, and drum-and-bass on this debut CD. Brownstein's pummeling bass and Magner's brain-bending keys bring their trademark trance-fusion sound into a new domain.
