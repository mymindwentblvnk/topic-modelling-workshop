The band started out back in -96, but in '98 the first singer joined and a two song demo was recorded, "Path of Delight". The response was amazing and they got their first contract, but with the singer only being 15 years old and no one in the band was over 18, the 10 year contract was neglected.

One of the founders of the band, Andreas (guitars) left the band in 2000 and was replaced by Peter (Electronics).

The first real demo "Eyecon" (2001) got a great response, around the world, (9/10 www.swedishmetal.net, 8/10 close-up SWE) and things started to go Cipher System's way. Magnus, the new guitarist was hired and shortly after that they recorded 3 new songs. The recording (Promo 2003) caught the attention of Lifeforce records. This recording, is what, became the split-CD with By Night.

Cipher System recorded 10 great melodic metal songs in Studio Fredman May 2004. This is what became their first full length CD: "Central Tunnel Eight". It was released through Lifeforce Records in november 2004.

NOW!!... Cipher System has been quiet for a couple of years, but are now writing songs again and 9 new songs have been crafted up! In March 2008 they added vocalist: Andreas Solvestr√∂m to the line up and Andreas Allenmark as the new guitarist. Cipher System are also willing to negotiate with interested labels for the release of their upcoming album.. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cipher+System">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
