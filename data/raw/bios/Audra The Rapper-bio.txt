Just like most of the greats, Audra’s love and push for music came from what she knew best – her family. Raised by her single-mother and grandmother in Richmond, Virginia, music was a great inspiration to Audra, especially when it comes to Jazz. Who knew that on October 4, 1989, Washington D.C. would birth a female wonder, Audra The Rapper.
Audra found ways to use her love for music for beneficial causes. She became highly recognized in Richmond, Virginia for the start of her charitable organization, “The Audra M Green Music For A Cause Foundation,” founded in 2007 at the age of 17. The foundation focuses on youth HIV/AIDS awareness/prevention and youth violence and teen pregnancy prevention.

She released 3 mixtapes:

- The Miseducation Of Audra
- Sweet And Sour
- No such Thing Does Exist EP <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Audra+The+Rapper">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
