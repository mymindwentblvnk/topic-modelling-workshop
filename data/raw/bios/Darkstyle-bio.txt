The talented duo of Weno & Anna, from Finland, presenting trance-inducing atmospheric metal with an epic, & sometimes grandiose or heraldic edge. Darkstyle are adept at exploiting simplistic & repetitive melodies with ambient Power-riffage/grind & etherial whispers  to grab YOU, the listener, into a hypnotic groove reminiscent of flowing, sinuous mesmerizations of Cobra snake-charmers.
