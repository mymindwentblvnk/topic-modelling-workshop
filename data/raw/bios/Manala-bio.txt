Manala was formed sometime in the year 2004 at Kajaani, Finland, by Warggoath Sinista, who is the only member of the band. Manala recorded songs under many different names before finally settling for the name Manala sometime in 05-06.

The main idea was clear from the beginning: to make noisy, over-the-top disorted, personal black metal with minimalistic riffing and with absolutely no technical value at all. There also was promise that there would never be the word 'Satan' in Manala's lyrics nor would it be consisted in any titles.

In the year 2006 Manala's first demo "Legionarus Luciferi" was released as a cd-r. During the same year the second demo "Kult Belial - Pathway Into Qlippoth" was released.

In the Year 2007 the demo "Forest of Flesh" was released

The demo "Night Sky Domini" was released in 2008, with cover art drawn by Katoamaton. Late August saw the release of the demo "My Travels...", with cover art again done by Katoamaton.

The line-up still consists - and will consist for as long as Manala records music - of only one member: Warggoath Sinista.

Only future will show what Manala becomes...
