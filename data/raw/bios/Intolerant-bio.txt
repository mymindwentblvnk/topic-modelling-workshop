Formed by the members of two genre-defining bands, Intolerant's music is a mixture of traditional thrash metal combined with borrowed elements from death, stoner metal, hardcore and even classic rock n' roll.

Currently doing the rounds in the local underground music circuit and scheduled to release their debut full-length this 2008, the band has been playing for numerous crowds in and out of Manila, and notably played such big events as the 2007 Fete del Musique, The 2008 UP Fair, and opened for the PULP Presents: Shadows Fall Live In Manila gig recently this year. Recently, the band stole the show with their performance at the country's largest annual rock festival the PULP Summer Slam (now on its eighth year, dubbed as THE PULP SUMMER SLAM FOREVER) in front of a massive crowd of 30,000+ rabid music fans, and performed in Hong Kong  July 2008.

Featuring Skychurch vocalist/bassist Russell dela Cruz (who now plays guitar, and still screams), Skychurch guitarist Joey Dizon on lead guitar and former Loss of Control members Mic Gallegos and Pepo Gohu (on bass and drums respectively, Intolerant is dead-set in the process of making heavy metal even more creative, and open-minded without abandoning the traditional elements that have made it both timeless, and uncompromising. Though Intolerant's inception seems almost recent, the band appeals as a group that has both the know-how and the balls to deliver with each punch.

Look out for their full-length debut this mid 2008, tentatively titled Reasons For Unrest, which is a sonic barrage of 10 metal-as-hell tracks that feature the band's characteristically tight yet well-rounded sound that's both aggressive yet thought-provoking.
