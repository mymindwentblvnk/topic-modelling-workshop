Church Of The Dead established 2012 in Helsinki, Finland.

 

It’s filthy and it reeks like Death Metal used to! We are into punk, morbid humour, horror movies and bands like Slayer, Cannibal Corpse, Necrophagia, Autopsy, Carcass and Repulsion. Although we carry the flag of old school DM high, the music that we play represent everything that we find is great in music.

 

This is our vision of Death Metal: it’s raw, simple and should be played really fucking loud!

 

Before sinking their teeth into ritual, cult, demon and madmen infested cadavers the gravediggers of COTD have been earning their stripes in bands such as Dead Shape Figure, De Lirium’s Order, GAF, Ghoul Patrol, Gorephilia, Lithuria and Temples. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Church+Of+The+Dead">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
