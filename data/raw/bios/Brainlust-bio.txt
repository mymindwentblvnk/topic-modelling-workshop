Hailing from Budapest, Hungary, Brainlust was formed in 2007 with the intent to play something unique in the veins of both traditional and scandinavian death metal and hardcore. Their music incorporates melodic riffs, twin leads, blastbeats, a varied range of extreme vocal styles and heavy breakdowns. Influenced by horror movies and mostly zombies, their lyrics and music both reflect a macabre atmosphere, thus creating a melodic yet brutal sound. They recorded a two-song demo in January 2009, and started performing live in April. After playing numerous shows and meeting great initial reception, their latest EP entitled ‘Arise of the Reanimated’ was self-released in June 2010, presenting an improved sound and a wider range of musical influences. 2011 marks the release of the two-song single 'Pit of Horrors' and the addition of bassist Zsombor Berki, both steps towards achieving a more complex and progressive sound.
