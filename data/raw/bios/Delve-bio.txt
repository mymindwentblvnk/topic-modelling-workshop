1)Swedish Death Metal from Ã…hus. The band changed their name into Verminous (Swe) in 2002.

2)There are two bands who share the name Delve. One is from Vancouver BC, active mainly through 1992 to late 1994, Delve is a British-style pop band with a heavier grungier side at times. Known for their "wall of sound" heavier live show that was dynamic and very tight. The band placed second in a controvercial Shindig '94. Recently included in an archival various artists release from Zulu Records 2006, it is also rumoured that a Delve reunion may occur by the summer of 2007! The other are a British post-metal band based in Stockton-on-Tees they have released two self-financed EP's and are currently considering a third.

And there once was another band called Delve who wrote and recorded a single EP before going their separate ways; from London, UK, their style was diverse and fuelled by the mania within the members. They only ever played one gig but it was "off the hook", local sources say.
