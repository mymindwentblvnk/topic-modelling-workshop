ANDA JALEO (Fire Records, 2010) Federico Garcia Lorca’s popular folk song collection “Las Canciones Populares Espanolas” was banned under Franco’s dictatorship and today the music survives but marginally within the Spanish sub-conscious. Taking their cue from Lorca and La Argentinita’s infectious 1931 recording of the songs, Josephine Foster a nd her partner Spanish musician Victor Herrero have arranged the poetically rich collection for their new acoustic band, formed while living in the Grenadine Sierra. Anda Jaleo is the band’s live recording of “Las Canciones”; a visceral celebration of the persistance of popular anonymous song.
