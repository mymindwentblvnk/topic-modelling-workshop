Metal is a theatrical, powerful and passionate medium. A voice of expression dependent on experience and pain, usually reaching down to the darkest areas of the soul. But this is not just any metal... this is Titanium Black!

In 2004 founding member and lead vocalist Terry Michael LeRoi sent a demo to world renowned rock producer Michael Wagener who was immediately impressed by Terry's "powerhouse vocals and vulnerable song writing." Michael signed on within days of receiving the songs and produced what was to become Titanium Black's acclaimed debut album, "Bleed For You."

Since that time, the Upstate New York metal outfit has been crafting and fine tuning their introspective brand of heavy metal, playing shows throughout the U.S. and Europe.

In 2007 they toured in and around Stockholm Sweden and in 2008 performed in Germany at the Magic Circle Festival with Manowar, Wasp, Doro, Ted Nugent and Alice Cooper...their song "Stripped" is featured on the MCF 2008 DVD.

The band is currently playing select shows in the U.S. and will release their second album in the fall of 2010.
Titanium Black invites you to experience their powerful, dramatic live performance and songs that ElectricBasement.com's Vinnie Apicella calls "metallic and majestic examples of might and mental awareness."  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Titanium+Black">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
