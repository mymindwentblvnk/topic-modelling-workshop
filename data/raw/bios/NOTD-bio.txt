Electronic duo NOTD (pronounced "noted") formed when its two members were still in high school. The duo -- Samuel Brandt (aka Severo) and Tobias Danielsson (aka ToWonder) -- built an audience with a prolific series of tropical-inspired future bass remixes of hit singles by the likes of Ed Sheeran ("Shape of You"), Shawn Mendes ("There's Nothing Holding Me Back"), Alessia Cara ("Scars to Your Beautiful"), DJ Khaled and Rihanna ("Wild Thoughts"), and more. While their Sheeran remix hit ten-million streams, their spin on Stanaj's "Romantic" racked up 45 million. In August 2017 the pair released their original debut single, "Summer of Love," featuring Norwegian pop singer Dagny. ~ Neil Z.
