BREWTALITY is an Austrian Rock Band providing expressive and melodic Rock Songs along with a marvelous Seventies Voice and choirs. Music, which hits you straight in your face, serving a taste of ashtrays filled with whiskey and beer, making you ready to hit the stage and party all night long.

BREWTALITY obtain their influences from bands like AC/DC, Deep Purple, KISS, Led Zeppelin, The Who and Motörhead.

BREWTALITY is the result of a Rock band founded by three schoolmates, David Zenz, Stevo Cannonball and Oliver Butz, in 2000 at the age of 14 in Vienna, Austria.

In 2003, after a few gigs and some songwriting, the band recorded an EP called “Girl Power”. A year after that Stevo Cannonball left the band because of differences in musical taste, so the band was looking for a suitable replacement, which was found with Manuel Pache (guitars, vocals) and Ario Omidvar (guitars) for awhile. Manuel Pache was the first to leave and was replaced by Alex Karlin (guitar, vocals) in 2004 after just one gig, while Ario Omidvar left a few months later

In 2005 the band now called BREWTALITY recorded their second EP called “Flesh” and started to build up a gig history by playing lots of gigs in the Austrian capital Vienna and the outskirts surrounding.

In 2006 BREWTALITY achieved their so-far peak by playing at the festivity of “30 years of Arena Wien, a festival called “Sauzipf Rocks” in front of 2,000 listeners and a winter follow-up called “Rock over Radenthein”.

From 2006 to late 2009 the band blew up their experience in playing live and loud with international acts like Asteroid (SWE), Blowback (SWE), Mother Misery (SWE), Korpiklaani (FIN), Texas Motherfuckers (SWE), Pungent Stench (AUT), Colour Haze (GER), Mastic Scum (AUT), Phinius Gage (UK), Cherry Overdrive (DK), Trashcan Darlings (NOR), Nebula (USA), Valient Thorr (USA) until Olly (drums) decided to quit the band due to personal reasons in January 2010.

In March 2010 Bernd Morawetz joined BREWTALITY as their drummer, left in November 2011, and was immediately replaced by Ben Arslan, with whom BREWTALITY is planning for the future.
