B. Bravo adds a touch of love to every funked-out late night synth groove he gets his hands on.  

Hailing from California under the influence of west coast GFunk, Roy Ayers and Herbie Hancock, he's pioneering a new sound in electronic music connecting interstellar funk and R'n'B with contemporary dance, hip hop and 'bass' music. As a founding member of the Frite Nite label/crew based in San Francisco, he is also a driving force in the emerging worldwide Modern Funk Movement. 

Bravo's massive tune 'Computa Love' gained international acclaim as one of London tastemaker Benji B's 'best of 2009' selections for his BBC 1xtra radio program, and as the lead track and 12" from Gilles Peterson's 2010 Brownswood Electr*c compilation. Red Bull Music Academy hand picked Bravo as a participant to attend their coveted program in London for 2010 and continue to support him as celebrated alumni. 

As a DJ and live performer, complete with synths, vocoder and talkbox, Bravo has shared the stage with artists like Chromeo, Dam-Funk, Flying Lotus and in 2011 serenaded crowds across the world with his bass heavy outerspace boogie and dirty grinding synth grooves at festivals like SXSW, Detroit Electronic Music Festival, and Sonar in Barcelona.  

2011 also saw the release of Bravo's third solo release, the highly praised Kiss 'n' Tell EP on the Earnest Endeavours imprint, and the formation of his seductive live band ''The Starship Connection' co-piloted by fellow SF funkster, Teeko. Their collaboration EP is due out early 2012 on Frite Nite records as well as an official Teeko & Bravo remix for Mark Ronson feat. D'Angelo. Also in the works for 2012 - Mr. Bravo's highly anticipated debut LP! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/B.+Bravo">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
