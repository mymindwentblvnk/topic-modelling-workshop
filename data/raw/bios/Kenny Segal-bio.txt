Starting with piano, then cello, Kenny Segal aka syndakit, eventually found his way to computers. After never really completing his PASCAL coded 3D texture mapping engine during high school, he funnelled his boredom into a DOS music program called Fasttracker and this quickly became his new creative outlet. He hooked up walkie-talkies to his cello, and he sampled drum machines through his guitar amp, but it was around 11th grade when some friends exposed him to drum-n-bass and IDM, that his music began to take a more definitive direction. Fascinated by the intricately programmed breaks, Kenny worked hard on his craft and began to fashion a style of funk-fused melodics over hard programmed breaks.

As he finished college, Kenny completed albums with P.E.A.C.E. (Megabite), Phoenix Orion (3080 Flux), and Dr.oop (Memoirs of Planet Lovetron). His tracks also began making regular appearances on Abstract Rude and Project Blowed releases (PAINT, Showtyme, Coup de Theatre, 10 Year Anniversary, Still Making Tracks, etc).

He also currently plays keyboard and sampler in a rock band, Attached By Wires, and produces music in many genres which have been featured everywhere from TV commercials and video games to adult films.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kenny+Segal">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
