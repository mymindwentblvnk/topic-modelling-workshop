Pavementsaw (sometimes referred to as Pvmntsw) is a solo sludge/doom/ambient project of Jon Eriksson. With a small discography of limited releases he has progressed from his earlier sludge/doom of Solid Air Clash (demo cassette, 2003) to his latter 3" efforts, Neverending Well of Piss and FÃ¶rintelsens Elfenbensportar (2007, and 2008 respectively) which have warped into an ambient, almost neo-folk drone; although to categorise this music is unfair on the range of sounds involved. These releases sandwich his only full-length Da Indi in Qua mi Four le Serpi Amiche, released in 2005, which documents the transition between styles.
