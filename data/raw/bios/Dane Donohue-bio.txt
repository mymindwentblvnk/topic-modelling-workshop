Dane Donohue was born and raised in Mansfield, Ohio on August 30, 1948. After 2 years of touring all over the States and Europe playing Jesus in the rock musical "Jesus Christ Super Star" in the early 70's, Dane started to make demo recordings and sent them out to all parties who may show their interest. Thus, Dane got a management contract with Leber-Krebs in New York City and then got an album deal with Columbia Records, USA. Dane took 3 years to complete his solo debut album and it was released in 1978. The album was Produced by Terence Boylan and featured many renowned vocalists and musicians. You can understand why I would pick this album as a masterpiece of West Coast Sound once you listen to it! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dane+Donohue">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
