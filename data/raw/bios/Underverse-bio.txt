Underverse was found at the beginning of 2007 in Alavus. With the same group but different name we have nevertheless played from the year 1998. Sometimes there were long breaks because band members separated to the different cities. During this time we played mostly just cover songs.

In the year 2007 we founded new spark and developed our music from the experiments of early days. Because of this, we founded a new band with a new name and since then, we have quickly made lots of new songs. We got our first demo (Eternal Death and Glory) out in May 17, 2007 and the second one (Facing Worlds) in September 8, 2007. Newest EP Enigma of Steel was released 10.2.2009.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Underverse">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
