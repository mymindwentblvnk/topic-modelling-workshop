Melodic Death Metal from Augusta, GA.


Formed in 2003, By The Sins Fell Angels has been shredding crowds around the south eastern area for 2 years now. Having played with bands including The Black Dahlia Murder, 3 Inches Of Blood, The Red Chord, Between The Buried And Me, Aria, and Trivium just to name a few. This band is not to be taken lightly. Having a range of influences that include Dissection, Suffocation, Carcass, and At The Gates, this Georgia Metal band's brutality must be witnessed in person.
