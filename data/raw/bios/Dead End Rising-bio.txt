Dead End Rising was founded in 2007 as follow-up band of the death metal-combo Infection Zero.  In May 2009 the band released their first demo-record titled HUMAN RECONSTRUCTION.  The demo is available as free download, but you can order a CD with booklet and so on for 1 â‚¬. In the summer of the same year the band came up with two new songs. They are suggestive of the band's future direction.

  Members of the band include: Tosh on bass and vocals, Malte on guitars, Bob on guitars, Martin on keys, and Bene on drums.
