There are 2 groups with the name Life Coach.

1. Life Coach is a collaboration. Following Phil Manley’s 2011 solo debut Life Coach, which Aquarius Records called, “a serious, and seriously kick ass slab of modern minimal krautrock,” Manley set about writing a set of songs that he could perform live. After writing and tracking guitar, bass, synth, and vocals on his own, he recruited his friend and former Golden bandmate drummer Jon Theodore, with whom Manley has been playing music for two decades, as the drummer and second official member of Life Coach. Jon is best known for his work in The Mars Volta, and this weekend made his live debut with Queens of the Stone Age at Lollapalooza Brazil. He has also recently been linked to DaM-Funk, One Day as a Lion (w/ Zach De La Rocha) and Giraffe Tongue Orchestra (w/ mems of Mastadon and Dillinger Escape Plan). 

The complimentary kinship between Manley’s tightly constructed songs and Theodore’s unrestrained playing was instant. Rounded out by the addition of Isaiah Mitchell (Earthless, Golden Void), who contributes lead guitar on several songs, Life Coach was born as an entity unto itself. Alphawaves was written as a singular piece, each song flowing into the next, forming a dynamic musical narrative. The record is propulsive with a sense of forward motion never receding; it is telling that when performing live, Life Coach plays the album to completion. Alphawaves delivers technicolor charm and grit in equal measures. It emanates positive energy, yogic in its approach and euphoric in its execution.

2. Life Coach was a one man indie/electronica project from Edinburgh in Scotland.   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Life+Coach">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
