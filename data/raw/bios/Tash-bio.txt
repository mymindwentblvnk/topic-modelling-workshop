Tash stands for the soulful R&B/pop of Australian singer and songwriter Tash Palmer. Her silken vocal delivery was discovered online by American producer Mark J. Feist in 2016, leading to a series of studio singles beginning in 2017.

Based in Sydney, Palmer grew up in a family of musicians; her mother taught guitar, her father played bass, and her brother introduced her to some more advanced chords when, at 13, she decided she wanted to start writing and performing her own material. Palmer began by posting acoustic covers of artists including Ariana Grande on Instagram. She was soon discovered by Mark J. Feist (Mary J. Blige, Destiny's Child) via the daughter of his label partner, Australian entrepreneur Mark Finn. They signed the 14-year-old Palmer to Hit Makers Entertainment and brought her to Los Angeles to work on singles like 2017's "Lil' Love Song" and "I Don't Like Parties." The songs were initially released under her full name. More of her yearning mid-tempo tracks, including "Worried" and "Softly," followed in 2018 before she started going by simply Tash with that September's "Wise." After a handful of 2019 tracks, including the hit "Loverboy," Tash issued the EP Volume 1. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tash">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
