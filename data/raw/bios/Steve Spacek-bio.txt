Steve Spacek, the acclaimed voice behind the ground-breaking genre-pushing group Spacek (who were championed by everyone from Entertainment Weekly to Mos Def), made a name for himself at the turn of the century with the song “Eve’ (recently covered by Dwele). The song set off a worldwide buzz on Steve as a singer and his group’s futuristic sound.

Imagine a robot performer in the future, in love with hip hop beatology and skillful enough to twist it into new shapes, programmed with an infused knowledge of the biographies of Marvin Gaye, Donny Hathaway and Leroy Hutson as source material for lyric writing and you might have an idea of the Spacek sound - Robotic, futuristic, hip-hop based soul. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Steve+Spacek">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
