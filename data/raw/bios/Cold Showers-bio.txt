Cold Showers, a band formed in Los Angeles, CA in 2010, fuses the brash power of the shoegazers with the smoky compulsions of the no-wavers—Cold Showers would fit comfortably within the dusty catalog of Factory Records, if only for an industrial subtlety in terms of electronics and acoustics. A piston-precision rhythm section drives all these loud, crafty pop songs. This is the pervasive pop mode against which Cold Showers cast themselves, but they aren’t fired in steel to the darkside. Founding members Jonathan Weinberg, Jessie Clavin, Brian Davila, Renee Adams and Chris King, added since, have a lumbering, sometimes terrifying beast of a band—we’d be remiss not to follow its caustic, addictive trek.
