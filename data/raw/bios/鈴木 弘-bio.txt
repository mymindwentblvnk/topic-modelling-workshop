Hiroshi Suzuki (November 12, 1933 â€“ January 16, 2020) was a Japanese American jazz trombonist.

Suzuki moved to the United States at 38 to play with bandleader and drummer Buddy Rich. Suzuki lived in Las Vegas. In 1975, he returned to Japan and recorded the five tracks on his album Cat. After the album's release on February 26, 1976, it didn't receive any notable acclaim. However, 39 years later in 2015, Columbia Records in Japan re-released the record to bring it to a wider audience.[1] In the 21st century the album has received some critical acclaim.

Suzuki died on January 16, 2020 in Las Vegas at the age of 86. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/%E9%88%B4%E6%9C%A8+%E5%BC%98">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
