Rytmeklubben (translated: the rhythm club) is a band, producer collective and dj crew based in Trondheim, Norway. We make, play and spread electronic music, live in concert, in remixes, on original tracks, in dj-mixes and at our club nights. We are trying to lift a growing scene in Trondheim, and at the same time promote live electronic music as an experience..
Rytmeklubben presents both the collective's individual #members and producers and music that we make together, and maybe even music others make. Maybe it's not that important to define what Rytmeklubben IS, the most important thing is that you are a #member and stay on the #map!

In addition to playing, releasing and promoting music, we also have our own regular club night at SUPA called Rytmeklubbing.
