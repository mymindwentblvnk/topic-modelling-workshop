Cyclophenia was formed in 1995 when it's founder desired to play heavier and more aggressive music then the bands he was in at the time. Drawn towards extreme music, such as death metal, industrial, and doom metal, founder J. Redemann (aka Thagirion) began writing his own batch of darkly tinged music. Barely being able to play anything but the drums, the earliest Cyclophenia efforts were hardly listenable, but the spark remained. Over the last decade the songwriting evolved into a more coherent and tangible format. Hashed out in basements, smoky apartments, and clad in dingy urban decay, Cyclophenia's songs come through as hyper-kinetic melodic metal, stretching nebulously into territory covered by black metal, doom, goth, thrash metal and even industrial music. It is a tribute and a curse to the environment that produced it. As a one man musical project (at this point) Cyclophenia seeks to evoke dark emotional undercurrents, as well as tell a poignant story of humankind's desires and fears.

This latest chapter of Cyclophenia focuses on a near future story of a probable apocalypse, which is due out sometime in 2007.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cyclophenia">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
