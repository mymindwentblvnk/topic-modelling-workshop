Octinomos is a Swedish Black Metal band, started in 1994 by Fredrik Söderlund, also known for his work in Puissance and various other underground black metal projects. Before the split-up of the band they recorded two demos and three full lenght albums : On the Demiurge (1995), Welcome to my Planet (2000), Fuckhole Armageddon (2001).  Contrary to popular belief, Söderlund seems to have performed all the vocals; only on the mixing did he cooperate with Mårten Björkman. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Octinomos">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
