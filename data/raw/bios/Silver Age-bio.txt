SILVER AGE, progressive metal band from Novosibirsk, Russia. 

Project was started in 2007 by two guitar players (Dan and Kir) and first named as Dangerous mind. Then after few years toghether and several changes of musicians they decided to refocus the genre from melodic speed metal to progressive metal , rename the band and change female vocals(Olesya Veldman) into male.

All members of the band were students of  the same university and performed at  annual student's rock concerts. At one of these concerts they heard Mike, singer from young sibirian power metal band  and offered him the role of lead singer. At the same festival but year earlier they found one of the best young  bass players of the city, Mars. 

After a short period of time  Mike became new  frontman of SILVER AGE, this band name was chosen by Dan as the personification of  trends in Russian art XIX - XX centuries(symbolism, acmeism, futurism). From that moment begins the countdown and story of existing band Silver Age. 

During a year guys were in search of right drummer and finally they find Yaroslav, who played in a band with similar genre of music, then after a tiring hunt for a capable keyboard player at an amazing coincidence one autumn day Paul (former student of the same university)  phoned Kir and told that he saw Silver Age at the concert in honor of the city and want to join the band.

Nowadays guys have two releases: [EP] Trying to Fly, 2011 and the recently released [Single] Domination,
