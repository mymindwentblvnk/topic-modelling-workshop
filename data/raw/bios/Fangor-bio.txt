Fangor was a black metal from the area ofDoetinchem, the Netherlands. In 1999 multi-instrumentalist Niels founded the studio-only project Fangor with the intention to create melodic and passionate black metal. Accompanied by singer Jasper a demo entitled The Emerald Kingdom was released in 2000, containing five epic metal songs.

Unfortunately, studies and the opportunity to participate in several other bands caused Niels to put Fangor on hold indefinitely. Several attempts to revive Fangor were undertaken, with guest musicians from all over the country, but it wasnâ€™t until the beginning of 2008 that Fangor re-emerged from her deep hibernation. A group of very talented and experienced musicians were excited to revive Fangor with new material.

For the first time in her existence, Fangor is now a full-fledged band. The long pause has given Fangor the opportunity to evolve in a unique hybrid form of avant-garde metal music with more power, emotion, mystery and dynamics than ever.

In 2009 a 4-song demo was released called The First Sign of Life . In 2010 Fangor started recording their first full-lenght album. However, the band decided to quit in the summer of 2010. At that time the recording for the album was nearly finished, but never got completed. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fangor">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
