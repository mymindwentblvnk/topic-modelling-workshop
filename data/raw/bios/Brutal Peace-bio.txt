Brutal Peace was formed in the early 1993 by former top LA metal band's (Stone Soldier) guitarist Dan Sindel. Dan recruited the hard hitting drum skills of Lonny Pasillas and they created a slamming, no frills hardcore musical foundation. Bassist Travis Johnson was soon brought in to complete the power trio and the underground classic "Above and Beyond" 3 song demo was recorded in Aug of 1995 by Scott Sargeant (M.O.D/Lazz Rockit)

Last known line-up:
Travis Johnson - Bass (Flatline (USA), Dying Star, Deadsett)
Dan Sindel - Guitar, Vocals (MX Machine, Stone Soldier)
Lonny Pasillas - Drums, Vocals

The band is currently broken up. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Brutal+Peace">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
