The band was formed in May of 1997 by two guitarist, bass guitarist, lead singer, drummer and synth player. Five songs were written during the summer of the same year, which showed the musical way of Vale of Tears: the atmospheric, melodic black-death metal. However, gothic elements were recognized in our music. Lyrics were written in English, one of our friends, Tamás Fodor translated them, who still helps us.
   In September of 1997, the synth player left the band. We continued work in a decreased number and held the first live performance on 13th of December, 1997 with the company of Dying Wish in Karcag. We have been close friends ever since and we play together a lot with pleasure.
   We spent the next couple of months with writing song and playing live until the summer of 1998. The synth player joined us in the end of June and we started to prepare for the recording of our first demo cassette. In August we began work in Sándor Kiss’s mobile studio. The cassette, titled ’The Lord of Illusion’ was released at the end of September by our own financial support. After releasing the demo, two members left the band (synth player, guitarist). Fortunately, we found new members soon, and held the first concert with them in January of 1999. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vale+of+Tears">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
