2. Icaros is a relatively new symphonic power metal/rock band from the south of the Netherlands. Since the founding of the band in 2002, Icaros has developed their own sound, but they are influenced by bands like Kamelot, After Forever, Dream Theater, Nightwish and Symphony X . During a process of growth, older songs have been replaced or adapted to everyones liking. The band has their own way of combining symphonic rock and metal, in a variety of songs ready to perform. Their lyrics deal with a variety of subjects; from the French revolution to escaping in a dream world.

Icaros consists of Linda Aarts (vocals), Peter Hagting (guitar), Ron Marinussen (keys) and Joris Ligthart (drums). They are still searching for a new bass player.

The band is currently working on their first demo, which will consist three songs: Revolution, Elevator and Awaiting Seasons. The demo will probably be released somewhere at the beginning of 2007. 

3. Icaros is a swedish dancehall band.
