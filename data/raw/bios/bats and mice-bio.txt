Bats & Mice are an indie band formed in Richmond, VA. Members hail from bands such as Milemarker, Rah Bras, and Men's Recovery Project. The band play an undetermined genre of music, which is built on the foundations of hardcore and angular punk, yet it is more focused on pop song structures and melody than said genres. Their music shares qualities of that made by the subtle Death Cab for Cutie, as well as more harder melodic bands such as Cursive.

The band was originally formed by three members of Sleepytime Trio. After recording their self-titled debut EP, one of the original members left to pursue other projects. Bandmates David Nesmith and Ben Davis then recruited Four Hundred Years' Daron Hollowell and Ash Bruce. Bats & Mice's first full-length, Believe It Mammals, was released on Lovitt Records in 2002. The album includes haunting vocals from three of the four members over crisp percussion and intense guitar work with deliveries that range from dreamy to towering. Hollowell and Bruce then left to pursue their band Delegate, and Luke Herbst came in on drums. The EP A Person Carrying a Handmade Paper Bag Is Considered as a Royal Person was released in 2004. Herbst departed Bats & Mice to join Totimoshi that same year, and the lineup came full circle with Jonathan Fuller returning on drums. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Bats+And+Mice">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
