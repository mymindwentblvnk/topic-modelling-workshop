Vargleide is part of Blazebirth Hall and is a project born out of the ashes of Forest. Containing explicit NS themes and delicatley treating the subjects of death and apocalypse, Vargleide was a formidable Blazebirth Hall project.

Kaldrad (Branikald) and Ulv Gegner Irminsson (Raven Dark) were the principal members of this band and recorded three demos as Vargleide before finally losing their way and abandoning the project.
