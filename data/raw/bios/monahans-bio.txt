Austin-based band Monahans (not "The Monahans"), named for the desolate West Texas sand hills, balances thundering rhythms and atmospheric "landscape rock" with urgent pop anthems and spiritual campfire balladry (think Explosions In the Sky + R.E.M + Neil Young). Since their 2006 inception, Monahans have toured in support of Centro-matic and Cowboy Junkies, and played alongside the likes of J. Tillman & Magnolia Electric Co. Albums to date include Low Pining (2007, Undertow) and the 2009 Misra debut Dim The Aurora.

The current lineup includes Ramble Creek studio engineer/producer Britton Beisenherz, Roberto Sanchez and Greg Vanderpool (both former Milton Mapes members), and longtime Spoon bassist Joshua Zarbo. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Monahans">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
