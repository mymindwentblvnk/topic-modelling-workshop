Ophiukhus is a Death Metal band from London, UK.
Founded by guitarist/vocalist Charles Kirton and Drummer Jørgen Bjørnstad on the 13th of November 2011. Tobias
Perrin joined on Bass and Vocals, from 2013 to 2016.
Combining the frantic tempos and the technicality of death metal with the slow mesmerising riffs and atmosphere of
doom - dynamic, extremity and atmosphere are tools to colour the sprawling, concept driven songs.
Ophiuchus' sound is expansive and melodic, dark and heavy.
