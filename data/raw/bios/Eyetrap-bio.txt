Formed in Stockholm, Sweden in November 2000 by vocalist Johnny Wranning and guitarplayer Fredrik Rhodin. The history of these guys, is that Johnny was the singer in a band called Ebony Tears, which had a record-deal with Blacksun Records. Johnny recorded 3 albums with them, before he packed his bag to move on. He was looking for people who wanted to play Death Metal in the melodic vein. The draft for members got result... 

Hooked up with a new brilliant guitarplayer, a demonic bassplayer, a really hard hitting drummer and a female vocalist. Eyetrap Was born... 

Studiotime got booked and the jammingsessions began. Once again Lennart Glenberg from Zello was going to show off his violin skills, the trademark that made Ebony Tears first album (Tortura Insomniae) a classic one. What else is there to say? Just lean back and listen.

Eyetrap signed to Blacksun Records and recorded their debut album "Folkmagic" in 2002, but Blacksun Records ceased to exist before the album was released.. It can now be downloaded for free from the Eyetrap website @ http://www.eyetrap.tk (this website is no longer online). Eyetrap also split up after the collapse of the label. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Eyetrap">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
