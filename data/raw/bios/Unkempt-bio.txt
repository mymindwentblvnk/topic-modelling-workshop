Unkempt is a five-man metalcore band out of Lakeland, FL.  Unkempt have shared the stage with such heavy weights as Obituary, Whitechapel, and many more including supportive roles for Florida dates of the '09 Summer Slaughter and Thrash And Burn tours!
Their unique sound, brutal yet technically complex, sets Unkempt apart from other upcoming bands in the genre.
