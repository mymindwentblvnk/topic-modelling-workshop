In 2011, he released an album Hot Nickels under his birth name and opened up for British folk duo Smoke Fairies in London. After performing in a a gospel in Berlin, Lo-Fang was offered a publishing contract by EMI.

Lo-Fang signed with 4AD in late September 2013. He wrote "Blue Film" as he traveled around the world to Cambodia, Bali, London, Tokyo, and elsewhere. While developing "Blue Film" from a mixtape to a full-fledged album, Lo-Fang collaborated with Grammy-winning producer François Tétaz.
