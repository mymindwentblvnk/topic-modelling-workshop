Enbound was formed in 2006 by Mike Cameron Force, who previously had played with bands like Zonata and Poem, and also worked as a producer for Axenstar, Draconian among others. The intention was to create something special with Enbound, and not just be a normal rock/metal band.

Some years were spent working on material, finding the right direction for Enbound, and also the right members. The experienced bass player Swede was added to the line-up, as well as the extremely talented [then 17, now 20] year old guitar virtuoso Marvin Flowberg. And finally in 2009 the band found their singer in Lee Hunter [Lars Säfsund] who is most famous for his work in the band Work of Art as well as performing in musicals like Jesus Christ Superstar, in the TV program "Singing Bee" on Swedish television and performing with Biondo in the Rumanian Eurovision song contest 2008.

With Lee Hunter Enbound found their last missing link, and now they were ready to take on the world. In 2009 the recording of the Enbound debut album "And She Says Gold" was started, and a deal was inked with the Swedish label Inner Wound Recordings.

Björn Engelmann [Rammstein, Primal Fear, Sonata Arctica] was chosen to master the album, and did it with pure perfection. Thomas Ewerhard [Avantasia, Edguy, Masterplan] created the artwork for the album, and produced something of the highest class as usual. An exciting guest on the album is singer LaGaylia Frazier [known from Swedish television, the Eurovision song contest and much more] who performs a fantastic duet with Lee Hunter on the track “Frozen to be feat. LaGaylia Frazier”.

Enbound worked for years at creation something special, and the gold-theme that is found in the entire production binds everything together in a perfect way.
