ENDAST, translated from Icelandic to mean enduring, has become more than just a name for the Montreal based metal band, but rather an apt description of what they have come to embody. Outlasting the other underground bands they grew up with, since 2004 ENDAST has gone on to tour heavily supporting two independently released albums, playing nearly 1100 shows since their inception. 

2005′s ‘The Promise’ EP, and 2006′s full length ‘Odds Against Tomorrow’ have helped to make the band a staple in the Canadian metal scene. Now with the third full length album ‘Black Cloud’ (available now on iTunes Canada!!) the band is poised to take things to unprecedented levels. When asked what sub genre of metal the band fits into, guitarist and band founder Chris Arsenian is quick to set critics straight. “We’re a metal band, straight up. We play metal. End of story.” 

In a scene that is quick to pigeonhole a band with career ruining suffixes like ‘core’, ENDAST is looking to break free of sub-genres and incorporate elements from all walks of metal into their own unique blend. Every band is the sum of their influences, and ENDAST‘s influences are vast in both range and scope. Beyond the Icelandic translation, ENDAST has more accurately become a name synonymous with good people with a strong sense of community bringing good, heavy music to people in as many places as possible. With the strength and the spirit of the underground, ENDAST will continue to deliver True Canadian Metal with all the passion they have been known for. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/ENDAST">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
