Finnish doom metal band from Joensuu, formed in 2009. Its music combines elements of traditional doom metal, NWOBHM, and 70s rock. The three instrumentalists (guitarist Antti Koponen, bassist Jussi Kotilainen, and drummer Ripe Lindberg) have remained constant throughout the years but the band has had three different vocalists, with Jani Loijas (Tribute to Charlie Sheen) being the original singer. The self-titled debut album was released by I Hate Records in April 2014 and features Samuli Pesonen (The Wandering Midget) on vocals but he has since then exited the band and Suvi Laaninen (Syöjättäret , Pakanakansa) has taken his place. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Serpent+Warning">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
