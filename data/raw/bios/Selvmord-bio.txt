1. The Ukrainian band, Selvmord.

At present Selvmord consist of Valdmaar.

Selvmord has been formed in 2003 by Valdmaar. In the middle of 2004 Selvmord has four members, but owing to disagreements and nonacceptance of ideology by some members, there was the only correct decision to dismiss the band and continue alone. Selvmord with this line-up has not left any recordings.

At the beginning of 2004 with session drummer Wanderer Dragonheart (also in Tangorodream, ex-Wanderer, ex-Lych Gate, ex-Dusk Chapel) was recorded EP "..In Limbo", released by French label Eisiger Mond Productions. Drummer Taragorm has played in band since 2006 and has left the band in 2010.
