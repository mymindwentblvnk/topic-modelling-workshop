Founded in summer 2001 RAW EDGE from Eisenach/Germany played punk influenced old school hardcore. Due some line-up changes the sound of the band developed more into hardcore with metal influences. In April 2002 RAW EDGE released their first demo CD called 'stupidity of humanity' do it yourself. Also the following demo 'equality' was released in the same way in March 2003.
After tons of shows with bands like Stretch arm strong, Heaven Shall Burn, Walls of Jericho, Dark Day Dungeon, Settle the Score, Modern Life Is War, Mental, Ba'al, Risen, Malkovich, Elision, Strength Approach and many more the band has recorded some brand new songs.
In April 2005 RAW EDGE released their 7 track CD on BROKEN GLASSES RECORDS (now NO PANIC! RECORDS) called "taking command". The new songs are influenced by tough guy hardcore and heavy/death metal. RAW EDGE has worked hard to develop their song writing and musical skills to express their political and personal contents in the best way.
