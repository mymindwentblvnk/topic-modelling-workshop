 Jay Watson (also of Tame Impala), Nick Allbrook (ex-Tame Impala), Shiny Joe Ryan, Jamie Terry, and James Ireland. 
The original idea of Pond was to be able to get anyone they wanted to play whatever they wanted in a collaborative musical project. Their first album was released soon after in January 2009, titled Psychedelic Mango, which contained many psychedelic rock and pop elements. Their second album, Corridors of Blissterday, was completed live with an eight piece band in five days, and released in June 2009. This led to the creation of their 2010 album, Frond, released in May 2010, featuring a heavier pop influence than previously heard from them. 
After the breakthrough success of Innerspeaker, the debut album by Tame Impala, a band which shares three members with Pond, the album Beard, Wives, Denim was recorded in 2010 and later released to critical acclaim in March 2012.
Pond's seventh album, The Weather, was released in 2017 via Marathon Artists. Their ninth studio album, 9, was released in October 2021.
