There are three bands with this name:

1. A rock and roll group based in New York City, USA. The group was formed (as Rainbow) in 1970, and its most notable early members were bassist Gene Klein (later Gene Simmons) and rhythm guitarist Stanley Eisen (later Paul Stanley). In 1971 the band changed their name to Wicked Lester, and in the fall of that year they recorded an album for Epic Records, which was never released. Simmons and Stanley, feeling that the group lacked a unifying musical vision, began forming a second version of the band in late 1972. This second version, with an emphasis on more straightforward rock and roll plus theatrics, became Kiss in early 1973.   The unreleased songs surfaced as a bootleg [ album artist=Wicked Lester]The Original Wicked Lester Sessions. 

2. Rock group from Cleveland, Ohio that released only one single, "Here comes my girlfriend" (1981). Recently repackaged and re-released by Numero Group.

3. An American power metal band from Canton, Ohio. Their one and only release was 1998's "Better Off Dead". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wicked+Lester">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
