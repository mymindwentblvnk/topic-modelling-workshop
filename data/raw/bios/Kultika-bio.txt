Kultika is a post-metal band from Timisoara Romania consisting of Jack (vocals & keyboards), Fulmineos (guitar), Dragos (bass guitar), Mark (guitar & vocals) and Seba (drums). Though the band started as a black metal outfit in 2008, after line-up changes and experimenting with new concepts and music, Kultika is now the product of different influences from progressive or post-rock to doom, sludge
and other metal acts, which can now only be defined as post-metal.
  A mixture between a powerful sense of intimacy and violent lamentations, the music of Kultika isn’t an attempt at groundbreaking never-before heard music – it is simply the musical expression of its members and their influence; a musical composure void of the individual but filled with personality.

  Currently the band is recording its first full length studio album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kultika">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
