Supersilent is a Norwegian improvisational  avant-garde / electroacoustic group from Oslo, Norway, formed in 1997 and signed on Rune Grammofon. The band reportedly never rehearse together or communicate about their music outside of live sets and studio sessions.

Supersilent was formed when the free jazz trio Veslefrekk (Arve Henriksen on trumpet, keyboardist Ståle Storløkken, and Jarle Vespestad on drums) played a concert with producer, live electronics artist and self-described "audio virus" Helge Sten (a.k.a. Deathprod). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Supersilent">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
