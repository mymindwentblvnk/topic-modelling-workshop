There are mutliple artists by this name (none of which are the same as .upset, Dj UPSET, or The Up Set):

1. Upset is a Los Angeles-based band fronted by Ali Koehler (Vivian Girls, Best Coast) who is backed by Jenn Prince and Patty Schemel (Hole). Their debut album is set for a Fall release on Don Giovanni records.

2. Upset was a British power pop band. It was made up of Archie Brown (vocals), Robert Jones (guitars/vocals), Rolo McGinty (bass/vocals), Dave Berk (drums). They produced the lone 1980 single "Hurt" (b-side: "(10-9-8) Lift Off"), which took in blue-eyed soul influences for Brown's gruff vocals. The group toured with Dexy's Midnight Runners before folding. McGinty's later group The Woodentops had far more commercial success. Brown and Jones also had more success in later band The Bureau.
