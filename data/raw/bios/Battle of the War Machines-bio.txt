Battle of the War Machines, formed in 2007, is a metal band from Fife, Scotland whose style ranges through thrash metal and hardcore to old school heavy rock. Their influences include Slayer, Trivium, Children of Bodom, Helmet, Metallica, Testament and Iron Maiden but their own style is more than these influences would suggest.

They released their first album 'Trial and Terror' in December 2010 and continue writing new music and performing live.
