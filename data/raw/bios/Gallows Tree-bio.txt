After some years of rehearsing and some sporadic live appearances, we reach today having a solid formation consisted of Dinos Athanaselos (bass) ,Sotiris Sfikas (drums), Lazaros Anastasopoulos (guitar) and Cons Marg (vocals - guitar), releasing an EP entitled “Each Eleventh Hour” . <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gallows+Tree">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
