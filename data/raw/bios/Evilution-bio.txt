One of the underground's best kept secrets, Evilution are both unknown to many and cherished by a few. Starting in 1989, the band released their first self-titled demo which later led to a record deal with CT's "Pure Death Records", the small death metal label formed by Hatebreed frontman Jamie Jasta ( who also released Jungle Rot's "skin the living" disc...)

In 1997, the band's debut and most significant release "Shrine of Desecration" came out, seeing pretty limited distribution. There were were only a small number of CD's pressed, and even smaller number of limited cassetes and shirts printed before both the band and Pure Death became inactive in 2000.

Because of this limited number of pressings and short career, the band realized a semi-cult status in the underground of sorts. The full length recieved excellent reviews worldwide, and they enjoyed great success playing shows including the Ohio Deathfest 1998... It was not meant to last however, and after their breakup, vocalist Josh Pratt moved on to sing with NY's Dehumanized and 420, as well as NJ's Mortal Decay briefly before fading to obscurity with the rest of the members. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Evilution">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
