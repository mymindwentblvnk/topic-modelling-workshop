Richard G.:
 Archaios Ophios is a young band (on average around seventeen years) that presents itself on their first demo ‘Pale Shades Of Forgotten Gods’ by three self recorded and self produced extreme metal tracks. The info-sheet does not give a lot of info, so it’s probably best to turn our attention directly to the music. The first song has a rather traditional black metal feel to it; the thing that sticks out is the alternation between fast parts, where sanding paper seems to have been used instead of plectrums, and somewhat slower parts that are accompanied by melodic yet evil sounding guitars. The second song tends a bit towards Nile, because of the ultra-low growls and the Egyptian guitar riffing. In the third song, finally (recorded a few years ago), the main ingredient seems to be the terrible sounding drum machine, but luckily there is also a very neat solo at the end of it. This demo is most certainly not bad (the production is, but the band apologised for that in their info sheet), it just shows that this band clearly hasn’t found their style yet, which isn’t so surprising knowing that they’re still very young. Just keep on trying, guys, eventually you will get there!
