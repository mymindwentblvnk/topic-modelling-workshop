Some of us champion sports hero’s and some look to larger than life move stars for inspiration. Arizona bred producer Tyler "Arsenic" Larsen looks to family, friends, and expression. A true what you see is what you get character. Recording engineer by day, MMA fighter by choice, and beat-maker by sun down.
