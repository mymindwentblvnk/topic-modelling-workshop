J. Baracuz is a music producer/beatmaker from Berlin. His debut album "Lasergun Romances", released in late 2006, has already given proof of his talents and his sense for complex sample-based compositions somewhere between instrumental hip-hop and electronica.

"Lasergun Romances" also was the reason Equinox Records got in touch with him and licensed a couple of his tracks to be released on the “One Year & A Day” series alongside artists such as Free The Robots, Deckard or Emynd.

J. Baracuz' music can be described best as a progressive, interesting blend of shredded obscure samples, heavy mpc-soaked drums and modern synthetic sounds refined with some glitches here and there. The sampling approach behind all of his tracks is based on the idea of giving rise to not just beats but entire songs out of a "pile of broken dreams".

After a creative break he spent with studying, travelling and digging for records, J. Baracuz has found his way home in 2011 and will release his new EP "A Contemporary Witness" on Equinox. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/J.+Baracuz">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
