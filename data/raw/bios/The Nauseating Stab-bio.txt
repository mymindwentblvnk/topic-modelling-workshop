The Nauseating Stab are a blackened deathcore band, who are growing tired of most bland waves of local musical "talents," namely in the death metal genre. 

The Nauseating Stab is found to be driven by what most are completely oblivious to; the tasteless epidemic and fight for who's 5-minute long breakdowns are the heaviest. Unlike most, The Nauseating Stab takes that into complete disregard, and instead sticks to their roots. In doing so, the music comes on with a full assault of infectious riffs, thought provoking lyricism, followed by tasteful drum rhythms. All which are seldom found in this era of the death metal movement.

Gradually aggressive, and at the same time mentally stimulating, any fan of death metal or metal in general, can appreciate The Nauseating Stab's relentless endeavour.
