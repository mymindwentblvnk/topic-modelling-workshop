Ultima, born and raised from people with two common passions: heavy riffs and videogames. Both can be heard in every of their record: djenty riffs, powerful melodies and arrangements, with crazy synth sounds and uncommon ideas. Their shows are without time to breathe and combine some ambient moments with huge breakdowns. Jacopo Ceretta and Massimo Forestan, having already a band together, decided in the 2016 to introduce Patrik Roncolato to find the prog sound imprint they were looking for. Matteo Polonio came an year later, being the ultimate element for a massive djent band. Their first single, Malasomni, had the voice of Led from the band Kanjante. Some months later, Matteo Toffanin joined the band as the lead singer. Lyrics deal with strong symbols and messages (with some references from videogames and TV series/books) with a constant presence of a little right, a rushlight of hope. The EP "Meritamun" has been released in 2019, with "Malasomni" - published by Circle Pit on Youtube - and "Inadequate" as singles. Later, Ultima released a live session of another song from the EP, "Iconoclasm". On 2022, the single "Four Mornings" preannounce the brand new album to be released. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ultima">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
