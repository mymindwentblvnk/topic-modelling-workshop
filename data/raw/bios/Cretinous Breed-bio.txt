Cretinous Breed are a grindcore act from Plymouth taking influence from the likes of Napalm Death and Brutal Truth. Born partly from the ashes of legendary ( locally! ) early 90`s death metal band Cadaverous with help from current metallers Schiztome.

They only have the one demo currently available ( Among the Livid ) but continue to tour the west country semi regularly to one man and his dog. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cretinous+Breed">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
