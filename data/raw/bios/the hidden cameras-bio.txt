The Hidden Cameras are a Canadian indie pop band.

Fronted by singer-songwriter Joel Gibb, the band consists of a varying roster of musicians who play what Gibb describes as "gay church folk music". They could also be considered an anti-folk band, as is often associated with musicians on the Rough Trade label. Their live performances are elaborate, high energy shows, featuring go-go dancers in balaclavas, a choir and string section. Large banners, created by Joel and often featured on the band's record covers, are hung from the ceiling and lyrics are projected onto the wall. Yellow streamers thrown into the audience accompany the song, Golden Streams and band members lead the audience in special made-up dances for particular songs.

The band's first album, Ecce Homo, was released independently in 2001 on EvilEvil. It was after this first release that Gibb assembled a band and they began to perform in venues varying from churches to porn theatres to parks.

Their 2003 album, The Smell of Our Own was released through the popular Rough Trade imprint in the UK. In 2004, they released their third album, Mississauga Goddam, also on Rough Trade. Both albums were also released on the independent label EvilEvil in Canada. Mississauga Goddam was followed by The arms of his ill EP, released by California label Absolutely Kosher Records, with jacket art specially created by Paul P. and G.B. Jones and containing 4-track demo versions of some of the songs from the preceding album.

In August/September 2006 they released their fourth full-length album AWOO. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Hidden+Cameras">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
