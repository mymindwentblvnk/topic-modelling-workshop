Torched Ebony Skies: the name, it in itself, ought to conjure enough.  For those who need more explanation, then they need NOT even bother with ignorant inquery.

Torched Ebony Skies exists solely for the sake of creating honest, true, and genuine music.  In this pursuit, the role of the ego is drastically diminished if not annihilated altogether.  Nothing is to be coerced, forced, or intended.  The sorcerers of TES serve only as "mediums" of communication, for whatever those conduits of discourse might be: gods, aliens, muses, etc. 

Artistiic expression, creative diversity, and spiritual fulfillment are of utmost priority.  Compensation and recognition are utterly meaningless terms that society deceptively uses against its taxbase simply as a distraction.
