The project was born in Bologna in 2000 by the meeting between Zappoli Michele (bass) and Matteo Migliori (guitar / vocals). Then the guitarists Giulio Capitelli and Federico Melandri join the band leading to most innovative and experimental musical ideas. With this line up the young band begins to record the first demos also playing live in the cityâ€™s clubs. The project permanently stars, after several members changes and musical styles, in mid-2009 when the drummer Riccardo Grechi (Lacerater, Cruel Face of Life) and the sampler Damiano Storelli (Dim Arcana) joins the band. So it starts the writing and production of their first full length.

The proposed experimental progressive is lacking any sort of preconceived idea based on a defined and precise musical genre, the work of art in question is, precisely, difficult to categorize in any metal/rock context. However, the band aims to create sounds never tiring, catchy and with a good dose of technique without the risk of being boring. This was possible thanks to the different experiences and musical tastes of the band members, certainly one of the strengths of the quintet.

The term "FURYU", which in modern Japanese means "elegant", was used in the poems of the late Heian period (Japan, 795-1185) to represent an aristocratic and nostalgic vision of life; literally means "flowing wind and water".

The album concept is based mainly on moods and human emotions. The synthetic phrases that characterize each title and song lyrics are intended to narrate the experiences of the protagonist in his own journey. Currently FURYU are ready to record in the Italian famous Fear Studio to complete their work. The idea is to create a professional product that will be taken all around the world and to make several live in Italy and Europe. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Furyu">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
