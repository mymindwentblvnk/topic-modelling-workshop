Road Tested features the music and guitar playing of Siberia-born Igor Belsky. Now living in England, Belsky traded -50 degree winters for an electric guitar, and wrote, produced, recorded and mixed the ten instrumental tracks for Road Tested in 1998. Paying homage to his many influences, including Ritchie Blackmore, Steve Morse, Thin Lizzy and Michael Lee Firkins, Belsky lets it rip throughout the CD, incorporating chromatic picking, double stops, pseudo steel string bending, delay pedal arpeggios, two-handed tapping, swept lines, legato phrasing and more. Air guitarists heed this warning: playing along with "Adrenalin Junkie" will cause serious damage to fingers and arms.
