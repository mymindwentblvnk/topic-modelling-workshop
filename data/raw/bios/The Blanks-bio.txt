There are several artists with this name, including:
1. an American accapella group
2. a Dutch musician and YouTube personality

1) The Blanks are an a cappella group. Most notably, they continue to appear in the TV series Scrubs in a recurring guest role, under various names such as "Ted's Band" and "The Worthless Peons". They have released an album, Riding the Wave, released in 2004.

The group maintains that all of their tracks feature only their four voices, and they do not use any traditional musical instruments (except for, as their pledge states, "talking toys, hand claps, finger snaps and thigh slaps").

The members are: Sam Lloyd (tenor, lead), Philip McNiven (countertenor), George Miserlis (baritone) and Paul F. Perry (bass).
Lloyd and Perry are also working together as part of The Butties.
