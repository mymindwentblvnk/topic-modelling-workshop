Arkaeon is a Luxembourgish technical death metal/deathcore band that formed in early 2011 in Troisvierges, Luxembourg.  They consist of Rosh Glesener (vocals),  Jones Lippert (guitar), Pit Seyler (bass) and Danny Schlapka (drums).  Together they try to create their very own sound that is a mixture of technical, brutal, progressive and groovy songwriting, which combines all of our influences and all the bands that inspire them.  

Their goal is to play as many gigs as possible and to spread their message throughout the world.  Their songs are filled with hatred against everything that makes this world collapse and of people that try to impose others their false beliefs.    They recorded their debut EP New Level Of Inhumanity in August 2011 at the EarWeGo Studio with their friend Fran√ßois Dediste, which has been released in November 2011.  On December 26, 2012 they released their new single The Illuminated, which did give listeners a foretaste of their upcoming EP that was supposed to be released in 2013.  However, that upcoming EP was released in 2014 and it is entitled Godless.

Arkaeon has shared the stage with bands such as Carnifex, Suffokate, King Conquer, Blind Witness, Placenta, Drown My Day, Novel Of Sin, Lavatch, Left Me Breathless, The Thin And The Fat Guy's, Kill The Innocent, Inhuman Rampage and A Mute Appeal.

The band is considered active and they are currently unsigned.  Their lyrical themes include religion and society. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Arkaeon">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
