Implodes is a psychedelic drone / shoegaze quartet from Chicago, Illinois, United States that prefers to keep the melodies and lyrics hidden in fuzzy distortion, reverb, echo and effects.
Mostly the sounds are distant and dissonant, but slyly hidden below the surface are rays of melodic sunshine that peek through the clouds from time to time.
