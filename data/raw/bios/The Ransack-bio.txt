Hailing from the north of Portugal their reputation as one of the country's finest exports is well-deserved. With 10 solid years of underground activity, they naturally became the Portuguese flagship of Melodeath.
Surfacing in 2001 with a four-track demo, Chaotic, The Ransack commenced with four individuals. Necropolis, the band's official debut, saw the light of day in 2004 and immediately caused a major positive stir in the metal underground. Undergoing a small line-up change, the band entered the Ultrasound Studios at Braga and created Azrael, one of the 2007's most intense and remarkable metal releases in the Portuguese Metal scene. In 2009, the band once again entered the USS Braga to bring to light Vortex, stating the band as one of the most successful extreme bands of the Iberian Peninsula.
At the beginning of 2011, The Ransack pushed themselves one step further by raising the bar in terms of song writing and production and returning with their most powerful yet melodic album ever, Bloodline. In order To take the band to a new level they united forces with the Portuguese Raging Planet and Austrian Noise Head Records labels. Hopefully this will open the doors that will allow the dissemination of Bloodline all around the world.
