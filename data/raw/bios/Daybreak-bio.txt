There are multiple artists named Daybreak:

1, Daybreak is an unsigned indie/rock band who perform in the American Midwest. The sounds the quintet makes are intended to be composed movements reflecting the go-with-the-flow attitude we wish we all could have (all of the time), along with image-driven lyrics and rather strange, but infectious melodies. The band is currently underground in Suburban Minnesota recording their first full length record tentatively called "influence/coincidence." They focus on creating songs with individual personalities; like humans, like nature.

2, A melodic hardcore/post-hardcore band from Adelaide, Australia.

"What you sing about is what you stand for... Daybreak is a message of hope and promise. We hope you enjoy our music and pray you take hold of the words and this message. We all stand for what we believe in and without that message, Daybreak wouldn't exist, there would be no reason for it to. Please come say hello at one of our shows, we would love to meet you."
