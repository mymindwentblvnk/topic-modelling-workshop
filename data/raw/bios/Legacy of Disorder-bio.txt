Legacy of Disorder come, for the most part, from New Zealand, where lead guitarist Rana Freilich recruited bassman Jason Keill in 2001 and later vocalist James Robinson in 2005 to shape their own brand of metal.

Earlier this year the band headed for Dallas, Texas, where, under the guidance of producer Sterling Winfield (Pantera; Damageplan; Hellyeah) they recorded their debut album, recruiting drummer Matt Thompson in the process.

With a lethal mix of youth and experience, Legacy of Disorder are heading for the highway, roaring like the thunder they have made their own.
