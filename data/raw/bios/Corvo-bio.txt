There are two bands named Corvo, one a '90s Latino pop group [Luna Records], and the other, a Darkwave duo that is currently recording their debut full-length CD [Telltale Music]. The following bio is for the latter.

Corvo: Romantic Horror Rock.... The deranged brainchild of instrumentalist G9 and singer-songwriter NiNi, Corvo is the culmination of contrasting, yet compatible sounds of theatrical opera and crushing guitars, elegant symphonies and churning electronics. Horror in all its forms is the common thread woven through Corvo's art. Born in part from a passion for cinema, Corvo's songs often instinctively evolve in "three acts," similar to the conventions of the silver screen.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Corvo">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
