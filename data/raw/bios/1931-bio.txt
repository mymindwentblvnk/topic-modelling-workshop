Hailing from Ohio's capital city, Columbus 1931 has spent years breaking through the metal and hardcore scene. With pulverising breakdowns, kick-ass solo's, through member changes, broken down vans, flopped shows, and musical differences one thing has stayed constant among the band, and that is their passion for music. 1931's passion for their musical creations is shown in their musicianship and live show that has been compared to Whitechapel and Suicide Silence. 31's treck through their musical life has not been one of ease. The band has seen 4 vocalists, 6 guitarists, 2 bassists, and 7 drummers in the past 5 years along with currently having former members of Rose Funeral(Metalblade), but it will take more to disband 1931 than that. Now with a new vocalist and a new direction in their musical careers and writing, the band is looking to accomplish more than anyone has ever expected from them. With new songs in the veins of Born Of Osiris, After the Burial and All Shall Perish, 1931 will destroy anything in their path to success.
