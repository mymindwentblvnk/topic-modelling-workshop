Kholera is a french mc. He  appeared on an auto-produced compilation named "les ondes d'ombres" (2004) released by a little indie association called Amplirikal. After that, he only rapped for an audience by doing freestyles and improvisations (except for 2 or 3 little live shows).

He's still writing and works on some personal and collective projects. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kholera">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
