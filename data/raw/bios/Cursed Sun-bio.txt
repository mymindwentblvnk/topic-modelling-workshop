Cursed Sun are a five piece metal band from Belfast. Formed in November 2007, the goal was to write quality original material incorporating many progressive and technical concepts.

The result is a mix of brutality, speed and power but Cursed Sun are not afraid to incorporate melody and the unorthodox into their songs.

"Cursed Sun are a sick, headbanging band who are full of potential!"
Dave (Endless Pain Promotions)

Cursed Sun have completed a tour of South England with more tour dates being planned for September 2010.

The ultimate goal becoming the realisation of a sound not yet heard before by identifying with their audience and communicating with an undeniable intensity. Old school sounds for a new era in metal.....
