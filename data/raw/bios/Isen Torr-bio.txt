Isen Torr is a British epic heavy metal founded in 2003. They planned on releasing three 10" EP's, of which only one,  "Mighty & Superior", has been recorded and released. The trilogy was going tell the story a legendary Anglo-Saxon warrior Isen Torr. Rumor had it that the band was going to play live only once at Keep It True Festival in Germany, when the trilogy was complete. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Isen+Torr">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
