Paranaut was formed in December of 2004. William (Bass; lead vocals), Paul (Guitar; backing and some lead vocals), and Kenny (Drums; accordian) began meeting for regular jam sessions. Out of this a handful of songs came out those sessions. The music, though simple in structure, has a flavorful and energizing quality. A back to the music approach, with snippets of vocals more often than verses. The music is reminescent of Kyuss or older High on Fire. It also has aspects of Sabbath, Neurosis, Melvins, and Isis. William's gutteral vocals are as smooth as an Arkansas highway and as clear as an Irish Stout. Somewhere between Dave Edwardson, Max Cavalera, and Tom Waits. Overall you get a smash in the face with some heavy driving music, and then a beautiful clean interlude, and then an epic finish. Then maybe after that you'll go smash some stuff! Yeah!! Sorry I got a little pumped up. In the fall of 2005, the music takes on an experimental twist. Just as noisy and sludgy as the original set, new songs are creeping in. Influenced by drone and noise (and feedback of course), this new sound brings powerful (and disturbing) ambience. These brooding epics still keep the riff alive, and that's what keeps you interested. Paranaut will disappear into the studio this winter, and be ready to take on some road shows next year.
