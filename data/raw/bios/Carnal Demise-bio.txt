Carnal Demise was formed in early spring 2007 at Karttula. Timo and Taave asked Hyde to play drums and he decided to join the band. We went to studio about three months later to record our first demo "Last Temptation/Self Deceit". We didn..t have a singer, so we asked if Portto from Raven Claw would like to sing for the demo. He said yes. From the beginning it was clear that we..re gonna need another guitarist and a vocalist. Tuomas took contact at us in early autumn 2007 and took his place as a guitarist. We did new songs and searched for the singer but we didn..t find a proper guy to that function at the time. We knew that we cannot play gigs without a singer although desire to the stages was hard. Our next move was go to studio again. We recorded three songs to the demo called "Rules... And Exceptions". Portto sings at that demo also. In this point band moved in Kuopio. Finally something remarkable happened; Jarkko had listened the demo and took contact at us for the singing place. He joined into Carnal Demise in spring 2009. Band became into a full line-up and was ready to move on. To the studio again. Our third demo "Silence The Worthless" was released in autumn 2009. Carnal Demise played its first gig at Henry..s pub in autumn 2009 with Enemy Of The Sun and people seemed to like it. Next we went to Outokumpu to film a music video from the song called "Beyond The Walls". In the near fufure we..re gonna play gigs as much as possible and do new songs for the upcoming record. New mixes from "Silence The Worthless" is also coming out. Now we have three demos and couple of gigs behind and the journey continues.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Carnal+Demise">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
