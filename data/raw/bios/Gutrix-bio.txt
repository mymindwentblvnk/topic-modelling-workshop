Gutrix is a side project of Mercyful Fate guitarist Hank Shermann, though for the most part there is little similarity to Mercyful Fate. Recorded in the mid-nineties well before its '97 release (and more recent US release on New Renaisssance), Mushroom Songs has a largely 70's feel to it, at times reminding me a bit of Judas Priest, other times displaying a bluesy side similar to, perhaps, Led Zeppelin. Another song (a Janis Joplin cover) reminds me of the stuff that Budgie used to do early in their career. Richard Plougmann's vocals are occasionally reminiscent of Rob Halford (I noted this before hearing the bands faithful rendition of "Exciter"), though he shows other styles throughout the album. All in all, this is much better than I expected. Probably a one-time project rather than a continuing band. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gutrix">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
