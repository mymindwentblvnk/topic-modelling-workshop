Prime Sinister are a French metal industrial band, whose members Pills, 96 and Fuse were originally in a band called Undercover Slut, who recorded a 14 track album called Communism Is Fascism in 2004.  They toured in Paris (Loco, headlining in a sold out Boule Noire), London (The Underworld), New York, Las Vegas, and Los Angeles.

In 2006, after getting rid of Undercover Slut's singer, they changed the band name to Prime Sinister and recorded, at the end of the year, a new album. The new sound is louder, darker, and more powerful with 96 on bass, Fuse on drum, and Pills on guitars now also doing the vocals. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Prime+Sinister">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
