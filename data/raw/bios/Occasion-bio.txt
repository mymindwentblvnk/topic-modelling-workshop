Started like a simple schoolband (it still is, but you can forget about the
"simple" part), Occasion has gone through many line-up changes,
name changes, and genre changes. The band (for some known as
Headache Overdrive, or Gunsmoke Messiah) made a very big change sinds Casper van Agt left and Geert followed him up. The music changed from
a little bit rocky to serious rock with many metalinfluences. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Occasion">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
