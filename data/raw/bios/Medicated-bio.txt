Thrash-death-metal with big choruses, screaming and clean vocals, hard rhythms and fast lead guitars. That's what 2005 formed Medicated is all about.

Being formed by Jesse, Samuli and Pertti along Henry and Dani, Medicated composed their first own thrash-technical songs, played a couple of gigs and released a self-titled promo 2006.

After the first release it was time for Medicated to step it up. Line-up changes were made. Things took up a notch when Aleksi (Imperanon) took over the mic-stand and Jani took over the bass duties. Medicated was reborn - tougher than ever.

New songs were written, rehearsed and played live across the southern Finland. In fall 2007 it was time to start the ambitious recording of the second release called "Magnum for Amen". Lots of technical and schedule-problems occurred, and because of this it took a year to finish the process. But the result speaks for itself.

Just before release, the band got endorsed by TC Electronics and Schecter guitars - to support their way towards record deal and spreading their testament throughout the world. Also, during the recordings, two friends of the band wanted to have a guest appearance on the promo. Mr. Crab (Bleak, Dimebag Beyond Forever, Guitar Heroes) nailed the solo to "Scream for God" and Aleksi Virta (Finntroll) composed keyboards to the songs.

Now Medicated has stepped on the road of big potential with the mixture of aggression and melody. There will be no intentions to stop here but drive to squeeze out all the ambition, skill and emotion into the future releases and gigs.
