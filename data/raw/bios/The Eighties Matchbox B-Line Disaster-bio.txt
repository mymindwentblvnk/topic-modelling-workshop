The Eighties Matchbox B-Line Disaster (often referred to as just 'Eighties Matchbox') were a rock band from Brighton, England, formed in 1999. The band's sound is dark and blues-inspired, with wild vocals and deep basslines. They call it psychosis rock.

The band comprised of Guy McKnight, Andy Huxley, Marc Norris, Sym Gharial, and Tom Diamantopoulo, until May 2005, in which Andy Huxley "decided to leave due to a decrease in musical similarities" and was replaced by Rich Fownes.

The band announced in March 2011 that they were to disband but in June 2012, the band announced that they would re-form with original founding members Huxley and Norris and performed at three shows.

On 13 May 2013, the band announced via their Facebook page that they decided to disband. The reason given was that no shared musical common ground was found when recording new material and that the band did not have the strength to carry on. It was also announced that members would now work individually on future projects. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Eighties+Matchbox+B-Line+Disaster">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
