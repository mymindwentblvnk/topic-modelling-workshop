PARASITE INC. - „This is how modern melodic death metal should sound. Absolutely fitting growls, strong guitar leads and killer choruses. That is what I want to listen to!“ (stormbringer.at)

PARASITE INC. was founded in 2007 in Aalen, Germany. From the beginning, the band found quick success performing their early songs while opening for acts like HEAVEN SHALL BURN and EISREGEN. In late 2009 they recorded their first, self-titled album and released it at the turn of the year to critical acclaim. Their fan base grew rapidly from their native Germany, reaching fans in Austria, Poland, and even Japan. As a result, the first pressing of the album sold out quickly. Critics praised „Parasite Inc.“. with rave reviews. In 2010 PARASITE INC. decided to dive into the German underground, and applied alongside 2500 other acts for the Summer Breeze New Blood Award. The outcome: they easily reached the finals and were one of five bands to share the stage at the Summer Breeze Open Air 2010 with RAGE, EQUILIBRIUM and SUFFOCATION. “Now it's clear: „PARASITE INC. can easily stand up to international comparison!“ (laut.de)

This is only the beginning. PARASITE INC.'s debut album shows them to be musical, focused and at the same time absolutely moshable.“ (metalnews.de) „This band stands out from the masses, because the sound as well as songwriting is exceptional.“ (metal.de)
