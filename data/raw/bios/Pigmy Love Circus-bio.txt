Pigmy Love Circus is a Los Angeles rock band that has existed since the late 1980s era of the Hollywood underground rock scene.

Originally they were known for lively, confrontational concerts and music that blended influences from California punk rock (Fear, Black Flag) with 1970s hard rock (Thin Lizzy, AC/DC, The Sensational Alex Harvey Band, and others).

Pigmy Love Circus experiences long breaks between releases, mostly due to the fact that drummer Danny Carey's primary band is Tool. The band has opened for the side project of Carey's bandmate Maynard James Keenan, A Perfect Circle.

Their songs make frequent reference to mysticism and ancient philosophy.
