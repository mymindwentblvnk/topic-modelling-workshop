Formed within the vital metal underground in Fusa, a small rural municipality near the west coast of Norway which had already given rise to bands like Inculter and Reptilian, Sepulcher debuted in 2015 with the full-length "Mausoleum Tapestry", a frenzied blend of old school thrash metal, death metal and punk, initially released on just 150 cassettes. 2018's follow-up album "Panoptic Horror" expanded upon the sound by incorporating more atmospheric and weird elements, resulting in an album not easily confined to a single genre or mood. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sepulcher">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
