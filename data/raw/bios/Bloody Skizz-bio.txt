Bloody Skizz was an Italian heavy metal band formed in 1981. Their only release was the "Gods Breaker/Bloody Road to Death" 7". The line-up included: Alex "Hard" Andriola (bass, vocals); Maurizio "Klein" Hazan (guitars); Flavio "Richie Sticks" Ghisi (drums); Dan "the Kat" (lead vocals). Three members played together again in the late 80's hard rock band Kandinsky, and in 2003 started a Thin Lizzy tribute band called Old Flame. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bloody+Skizz">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
