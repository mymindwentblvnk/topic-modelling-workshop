Fires of Tartarus are a metal band based between Hampshire/Berkshire.

Fires of Tartarus were formed in August 2011, consisting of Scott (Vocals), Dean (Guitar), 
Josh (Bass) and Nick (Drums).

The band got together through the demise of several local bands, with the members having worked in previous projects together over the years, some dating back as far as the 90â€™s. Fusing together a vast range of metal influences, from Death metal, Black metal and thrash, both modern and old,we quickly found our own style and sound. 

With the musicianship of the members of the band, we were able to incorporate many twists and turns within our music. Through huge, epic passages thrown together with heavy, crushing riffs, the music constantly changes direction, and also pushes our personal boundaries as musicians. The ferocity of the music served to make a very interesting live spectacle, with the band quickly slotting into the live scene around the surrounding counties, taking in many smaller festival events. 

With more and more shows, the band grew in its confidence. Through the course of the year, we worked tirelessly behind the scenes, engineering, recording and producing our self titled debut EP, which was finally released in September 2012. The cd rapidly gained momentum, earning us several amazing reviews, 
and also serving to earn some very high levels of respect from our peers. In September of 2012, the band parted company with guitarist Andy. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fires+Of+Tartarus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
