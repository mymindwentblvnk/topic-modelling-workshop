Formed in 2003 by Otso and Ville S. Self-Hate is now known as The Beheading. Self-Hate were one of the pioneers of the New Wave Of Finnish Thrash Metal (shortly: N.W.O.F.T.M.)

Self-Hate began to play covers from bands like Metallica, Kreator, Beherit and Diablo. In some point when the skills of the band members got better they started to write own songs about destruction, tsunamis and hating... 

Later the thing got more serious and SH made some demos and gigs and finally got a singer. The Mighty Hemppu. (Listen these absolutely brilliant and raw vocals from rare BM era stuff from: http://rare-sh.tk)

Finally Self-Hate changed their name to The Beheading and sold out. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Self-Hate">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
