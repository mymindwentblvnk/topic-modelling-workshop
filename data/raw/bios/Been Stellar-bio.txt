Been Stellar is a New York alternative rock group formed in 2014

The group was formed when Sam met Skyler, their first year of high school at Cranbrook Kingswood, in Bloomfield Hills, MI. They were at seperate bands at the time, but quickly started to play music together in Sam’s attic, at the end of 2013, and beginning of 2014.

Dominic Gould, who had gone to elementary school with Sam, and Miles Camiener, who Sam met in middle school, joined the band in 2014.

The fifth member Michael Lynch, who also went to middle school with Sam, joined the band on June 27th 2016.

They released their debut “Sells Out” on June 16th 2017.

Sam and Skyler currently attend NYU and have met more talented friends there, thus adding Nando Dale, Laila Wayans (daughter of actor Shawn Wayans), and Nico Brunstein to the NYC crew. This has allowed them to perform at venues all over New York. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Been+Stellar">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
