trickORtreat was founded in 1999. after many hours of songwriting and lot's of live gigs all over germany they recorded their first album in 2001. in these days the lineup was: 
cookie (vox), boo-t (git), rob (git) flixx (bass) and itz (drums). 

after finishing the album they split due to interpersonal problems. the following 3 years were all about keeping trickORtreat alive by finding the perfect lineup.

finally they recorded 3 new songs to show the development of trickORtreat, to hook up with you again and to blow up some stages.
