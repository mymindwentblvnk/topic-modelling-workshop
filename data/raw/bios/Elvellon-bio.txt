In 2010 the founding members Pascal and Martin laid the foundation for what later should become Elvellon. The writing of the music was not a planned process but a natural one and at first was a undefined development from many sources of inspiration. After Martin met their soon-to-be singer Nele by sheer coincidence on a party in late summer of the same year the band was able to find their own musical way. 
In 2012 they came to know Gilbert, who played in an other Band from their hometown Moers named „Ravian“ with whom they just shared a rehearsal room. First he helped out the band by recording some demos and became a regular member on new year’s eve. Since then the band felt more than ever complete and the progression accelerated at a great pace. The main reasons for that were an extended period of hard working on new songs, a lyrical concept and suitable artwork. 
An early outcome of this process was their very first concert, which they played in front of 250 people with an unusual high level of professionalism. The reactions were so overwhelming and numerous that Elvellon put all that gained motivation in the work for their first CD. On The 18th of October 2013 they released the single „Oraculum“ via Bandcamp.com . A 5-Track EP named „Spellbound“ has followed on the 30th of January 2015 as a digital release as well as physical CD. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Elvellon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
