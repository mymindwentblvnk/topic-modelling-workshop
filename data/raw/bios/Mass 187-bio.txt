Mass 187 were the most famous gangsta rap group to emerge from Kansas City, Missouri and, along with Bone-Thugs-N-Harmony and (Tung) Twista, the only noteable Midwest rap artists to have a major commercial breakthough in the '90s. They released Real Trues Paying Dues in 1996 to a moderately positive response, the sole single from the album being the popular "Gangsta Strut", released on 12" both as a retail pressing and as a club promotional pressing on Pay Day records. The group gained a considerable fan base in the South, particularly Houston and Dallas, owing both to their laid back "southern" G-Funk production, which paid homage to both earlier West Coast and 3rd Coast acts, and their loose affiliation with DJ Screw, whose 7 minute remix of their song South Side proved to be integral in earning them respect and elevated status in the South. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mass+187">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
