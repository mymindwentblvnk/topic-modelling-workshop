Maniakal Torment was grimly born in mid 2006 when it was spawned from the rotting, entombed cadaver of the member’s previous band. The band spawned from its member’s contempt for the way death metal had become faceless, and the scene, overcrowded by bands that lack personality, individuality and atmosphere. The band formed to play evil and primitive old school death metal drawing influences also from black metal and old grindcore.
After scrabbling around for the remainder of the year, scheming and working on material while entombed in their festering tomb, the band released a three track rehearsal tape entitled “Necrotic Exhumation”. The tape though raw in sound and extremely limited in quantity, gave the few who heard it an idea of what would be coming in the near future. Early November marked the point where the band finally clawed their way from the imprisonment of the tomb and made their way towards the stage to make their live debut. Several devastating gigs followed, leaving poseurs and falses dead in their wake, and dedicated followers of true death metal intrigued and craving more.

Maniakal Torment is pure old school death metal terror, and will not appeal to fans of weak technical death metal, and trendy “deathcore” music. This is for fans of bands such as DEMIGOD, ABHORRENCE, (old) MORBID ANGEL, DARKIFIED, (old) INCANTATION, CELTIC FROST, and NIHILIST. The weak will be crushed! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Maniakal+Torment">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
