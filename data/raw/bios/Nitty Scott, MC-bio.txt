Nittia Scott, known in music by her stage name, Nitty Scott, MC is one of the few females creating her own lane in progressive hip-hop, a new school fly girl who isn't afraid to get down with the cypher. "Born in Michigan, made in Florida, paid in New York," Nitty Scott, MC is currently launching an independent music movement known as "The Boombox Family", which focuses on organic, lyrical, message-driven hip-hop.  

The Boombox Family is grassroots music at it's finest. Nitty prides herself on making big strides in the industry in a very short amount of time, with no financial backing, no gimmicks, no major co-signs and no payola. She proudly represents Just The Way I Was Raised Music, the management company founded by her manager. 

Nitty Scott, MC's mission statement remains as it always has, "to be apart of a movement and not an industry, to be socially responsible and charitable with her influence, to inspire art and educated listeners, to promote substance in mainstream entertainment, to be praised by critical acclaim, and to document an era via the written word."
