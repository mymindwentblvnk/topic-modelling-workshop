Savoy Motel is an underground rock band in Nashville with sounds taking you back to the 70â€™s with their funky upbeat style and yet its an energizing take on the music of today. They seem to channel this nostalgic energy and present it to us in a very stylish and cool fashion. It all started when Jeffrey Novak formed this new project with Jessica McFarland, both in another band at the time. Joining up with Mimi Galbierz and Dillon Watson made the quartet complete.
