******* From Reagans near apocalyptic vision to Bushs war on terrorism. PROUDFLESH spans the times with their firebrand of music and passion. PROUDFLESH sings of epic struggles against colonialism in Indochina i.e. in a hell hole called Dien Bien Phu... To the carnage found in the killing fields and the extremes of the human condition. The arrogance and stupidity of war (not the glorification) , but honors courage and heroism where Love is never entirely extinguished.... ****** PROUDFLESH features SOTHIRA on bass/ vocals , is formerly of CRUCIFIX . With a host of bands such as A PERFECT CIRCLE, ORBITAL, SEPULTURA & countless punk/hardcore bands covering his songs. SOTHIRA is undeniably influential. And with ERIK LANNON on drums , an exceptional addition with many notches under his belt . ERIK has played in a line of notable bands such as MORDRED & The BAY CITY ROLLERS & many others . Last by no means least, he needs no introduction on guitar... JIMMY CRUCIFIX , what can be said just pales in comparison. Any place ,any time ,any how! He can play ,write, produce , complete. JIMMY CRUCIFIX Rules ok! ******The Trump of Fame in Clarion Strong, Their Dauntless Deeds Shall Vibrate Long!... Long Live PROUDFLESH! ..
