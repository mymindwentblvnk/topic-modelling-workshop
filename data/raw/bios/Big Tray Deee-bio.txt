Tray Deee (real name Tracy Lamar Davis, born April 27, 1966 in Long Beach, California) is a rapper who was once signed to Death Row Records and later signed with Snoop Dogg's label Dogghouse Records (now Doggystyle Records). He joined the Platinum-selling group Tha Eastsidaz, which consisted of himself, Snoop Dogg, and Goldie Loc. Simultaneously and after the Eastsidaz project he was affiliated with car club-street Band, the IV Life Family and their related record label IV Life Records, that later signed him.

Before becoming a rapper, he was an O.G., or an Original Gangsta of the Insane Crips gang in Long Beach. On February 2, 2005, Tray Deee was sentenced to 12 years in prison for attempted murder, stemming from a 2003 incident in which he fired at rival gang members. He is currently imprisoned at Salinas Valley State Prison, a new facility located in Soledad, California. It is one of many new prisons built within the area, often referred to being "across the road," from other facilities. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Big+Tray+Deee">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
