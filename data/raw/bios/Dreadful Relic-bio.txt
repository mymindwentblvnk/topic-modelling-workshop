Disgusted by the majority of modern - in every aspect - bands and the swineherd of the soulless mediocrity of the facebook user, DREADFUL RELIC's musical roots lay in times when albums contained more than mere music, untouched by the filthy tentacles of materialism and "success". Back in the days when those albums made the listener fall under a spell, longing for medieval times and the Ancient era.
Shut the doors to the mundane, leaving you alone and forlorn in a dying world.

Musically and aesthetically, DREADFUL RELIC is inspired by cults such as To Mega Therion, Obsessed by Cruelty, and Barathrum - V.I.T.R.I.O.L.
