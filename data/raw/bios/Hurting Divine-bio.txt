Hurting Divine was formed in the end of year 2007.
The founding members Jonne and Tuomas mixed their
big interests between thrash metal, hardcore and melodic
death metal and the result was something they named
Hurting Divine.
Next they had to search two guitar players and a bass player.
They made few elections for guitars and quite fast
(actually in the first meeting) they found Kalle and several candidates
later Sauli to rule the guitars. A bit later Toni was found to take over
the basists part in the band. At the end of 2009 Tuomas and the rest of
the band had to continue on their separate ways. Luckily Kalles former
corporal from the army was interested of joining the band and so
At 2010 the band is (finally) releasing their first official EP and
starting to break up some hearts. ;)
