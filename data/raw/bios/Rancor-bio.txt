Rancor formed somewhere in 1995, starting as a three piece band. Pascal on vocals, Fabrice on bass and Michel (Bloodsport) on guitar. Now you are probably wondering where the drummer is. Due to the lack of a good drummer in the MOC area at that time, they decided to use a drumcomputer and synthesizer. This created an unique sound; a combination of cleveland hardcore, metal, deadly precision drums and athmospheric sounds. Rancor debuted at the Geleen hardcore festival. After that they played serveral shows amongst that venues with Integrity and Ringworm. Also a mini-cd called distinguish was recorded and released on Life Force records. After causing mayhem for a full year; Rancor splitted up, due to new found interests. Early 2005, Pascal contacted Fabrice and Michel to see if they we're interested to do some reunion shows. In March that year, the rehearsel began. Because fingers were rusty and throaths were soar. It was until July that enough confidence was build up to play the first reunion shows. These shows were well received and inspired the band to continue. Looking for new ways to improve; a new guitar player, Kristof (chimaera) was added to the band. Although this added more power and aggression to the songs; the band felt like that there was still something missing. Rancor traded the drumcomputer and synthesizer in for a real drummer, Bert (Ashlar). In the meanwhile Frank (Ashlar) replaced Fabrice on bass. The two new band members have upgraded Rancor with a new sound and drive. Now that the band is complete, new songs are waiting to be written and shows to be played. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rancor">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
