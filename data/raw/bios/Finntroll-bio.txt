Finntroll is a band from Helsinki, Finland, that combines  folk metal, black metal, and Finnish traditional dance Humppa. Finntroll's lyrics are mostly in Swedish, the only exception being the song "Madon Laulu" on Visor Om Slutet. Finntroll's original singer, Katla, decided to use Swedish over Finnish since he was part of a Swedish-speaking minority in Finland and the sound of the language seemed to better suit the band's "trollish" outfit. Despite several vocalist changes, this tradition has continued.

According to band members Vreth and Skrymer, they took their name from an old Finnish legend where Swedish priests coming to Finland had an encounter with a wild-looking man who killed most of their party. The survivors came back bearing the tale of the Finn-Troll.

Finntroll's lyrics mainly deal with legends and tales revolving around the fictional Troll-King "Rivfader" and the trolls fighting against the Christians who entered their lands and spread their beliefs. A recurring theme is the story of two priests named "Aamund" and "Kettil". The first three full-length albums feature a rather short but fierce song about the two men who constantly get themselves into trouble with the trolls, only to get beaten up and mutilated over and over again by the wrathful followers of Rivfader.

To date, the band's discography includes seven full-length albums (Midnattens widunder (1999), Jaktens tid (2001), Nattfödd (2004), Ur jordens djup (2007), Nifelvind (2010), Blodsvepet (2014), Vredesvävd (2020)), a live album (Natten Med De Levande Finntroll (2014)), and three EPs (Visor Om Slutet (2003), Trollhammaren (2004), Blodsvept EP (2013)). Their newest studio album Vredesvävd was released on September 18th, 2020. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Finntroll">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
