NightCreepers is a young french folk metal band created by Haarath in 2006. It arose from a solo project fallen some years previously in the oversight. For now, their music is inspired by various myths, pirates and folk legends of our world and imagination. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/NightCreepers">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
