Mental Killing Spree is a Death Metal / Grindcore / Metal / Teutonic Trash Metal  band from Wilhelmshaven, Germany.
MKS is Death Metal, but has some thrash riffs. The vocals are near of an like of grindcore.  The riffs aren't melodic as Ensiferum, Amon Amarth or Metallica. It more like early Slayer, Bathory, Kreator and Suffocation.
The longest track from the CD Vae Victis have 8 minutes lengh, avoid monotomy, not like many metal long-lengh tracks, that have much monotomy.
Their demo was released last year, and acheived some sucess in the net.
