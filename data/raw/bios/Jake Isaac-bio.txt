Jake Isaac has had an eventful summer of touring in 2014 including a slot on the coveted Other Stage at Glastonbury. After supporting Ella Eyre on her UK tour earlier in the year, Jake returned to support Ella at her Brixton Electric show on June 12th.  Other notable performances include Jake’s recent shows with Paloma Faith at her Manchester Apollo shows and Bernhoft at his Shepherds Bush Empire gig.


Jake released his latest EP ‘War Child’ on June 28th while at Glastonbury, which went straight into Top 10 on the iTunes Singer-Songwriter chart. The ‘War Child’ EP reveals a wealth of fresh talent to be found in Isaac, from the beautiful, soaring ‘Hope’ to the energetic melodies of ‘Long Road’.  Jake is joined by Virgin/EMI’s Josh Record on ‘Never Leave’ and by JP Cooper on ‘Carry You Home’.
