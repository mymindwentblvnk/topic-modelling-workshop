Formed in January 2010 by members Ksaos,Kthien,Lykan,and Alix without a name,singer and just a couple of riffs out on the table.Finally the last piece Gore (ex.poison oath/worigntion) joined the band then Erimha was born."His vocals brought the aggression and brutality that we needed" says Erimha. Then in less then a year after the first riff was written Erimha wrote,pre-produced and recorded there first full lenght album"Irkalla''.In September 2010 the album was recorded with Chris Donaldson(Cryptopsy,Mythosis) at Garage Studio's in Montr√©al,Quebec.Chris who has been recording some of the biggest Metal acts from Montreal,such as The Agonist,Beneath The Massacre,Mythosis,The Last Felony,Cryptopsy,neuraxis etc....After the first day of tracking we knew that Chris was the producer we needed,bringing the best out of everybody.He brought the perfect mix of rawness and clarity.He also helped Erimha get Alissa White-Gluz (The Agonist/Century Media Records) to lend her astonishing clean vocals to the track ''The legend of Ereshkigal''. Few months after self releasing "Irkalla",Erimha got noticed quickly by album reviews such as www.nocleansinging.com and www.welovemetal.com and many more.Leading to the signing with Ed fassio of Itchy Metal Entertainement. Alix the lead guitarist left Erimha january, 2011 then quickly we recruited Dlusternas lead guitars.Sethyus which had tracked all the keyboards and instrumental on Irkalla,joined Erimha officially as a session member in studio. We are available worldwide physical with ifmerch.com/erimha for our logo t-shirts and our album ''Irkalla'' and available on itunes for digital downloading and amazon.
