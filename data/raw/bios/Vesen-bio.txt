Vesen was formed 1998-99 in Skogbygda, Norway, with the intent to pour out some ugly black thrash. A couple of demos and line-up changes down the line, Vesen released their first full-length album, the self-financed "Ugly" in 2005 (followed by a music video for the track "See You in Hell"). The album was well received by media and fans alike, and earned the band spots in both of Norway's biggest metal festivals, Inferno and Hole in the Sky.

"Desperate Mindless Aggression" followed in 2009, and the band is currently working on their third full-length, "Goat Carcass Rising". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vesen">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
