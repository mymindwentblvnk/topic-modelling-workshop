Assorted Heap was a thrash metal band from Germany.  They formed in 1987 by Dirk Schiemann (vocals), Gunter Groen (guitars), Klaus Kessemeier (guitars, also of BK 49), Lord Joachim Meyer (bass, also of BK 49) and Thomas Marter (drums, also of BK 49).  They released two albums in the early 1990's called "The Experience of Horror" in 1991 and "Mindwaves" in 1992.  They departed shortly after that with three members of the four founding a band called BK 49. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Assorted+Heap">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
