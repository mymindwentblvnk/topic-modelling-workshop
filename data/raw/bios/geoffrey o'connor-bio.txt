Previously known as the frontman for euphoric pop quartet Crayon Fields, Geoffrey Oâ€™Connor stepped out from behind his guitar in 2011 with solo album Vanity Is Forever, an assemblage of high-production dance hits, suave funk joyrides and modern synthetic power balladry.

New single Jacqueline is the first taste of his solo follow-up, out now via Bandcamp and on Fri Sep 20 via iTunes and other digital music stores. Geoffrey plans to return to the US in October 2013 for CMJ, with shows to be announced soon.
