The S.O.T.E Boys X


"Furious, passionate and utterly ruthless in their precision delivery of grinding riffs, pounding bass lines and killer hooks. Their savage combination of sweet harmonies and larynx wrenching screams, frenetic stage performances and huge sound are just part of the reason for their ever growing army of fans."

- Panic Magazine



'The Essex metal scene seems to be growing from strength to strength and these youngsters are possibly one of the finest talents to come out of the area so far. Soaring melodies and huge, wall-rattling metalcore is the order of the day with their debut EP, We Burn Forever, crammed full of quality tunes.'
