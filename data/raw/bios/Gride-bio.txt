GRIDE endeavours to play ultrafast and extreme fusion of hardcore and grindcore. But they draw even from other styles of music like metal, industrial or alternative rock. Their only motto is: Speed wins!!! Lyrically, they want to study and describe a relationship between individual person and present society. They aim their lyrics to describing of manipulation, coercion, abusing and reducing of personal freedom in post-modern capitalist society.
