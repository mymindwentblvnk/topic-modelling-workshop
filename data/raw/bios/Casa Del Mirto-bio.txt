Everything started in 2005/06. Touching the sound of 90s House with the release of 2 debut albums : "Supertrendycoolfashion" and "Numero Uno". 

"I used to write music for clubs and discos, but at the end I got tired of it. I always liked chamber music, intimate and introspective. So I felt the need to create something that one could listen also with a headset, giving shape to songs rather than tunes to dance at. Now CdM is an outfit that I am happier to wear, without It I would feel naked."

"Casa del Mirto" means "Home of myrtle". Myrtle is a plant often used for spirits. It’s actually hard to find where I live, but I really liked the name. Now, after 2 years I think it is a cacophonic name, but it’s the only one I got! So I don’t think about it and I drink the liquor." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Casa+Del+Mirto">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
