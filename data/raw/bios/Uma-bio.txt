2. UMA — an experimental electronic pop duo from Berlin.

1.
Uma is an Experimental Rock band formed by Om and Pogo back in 2004. The band was in their early days integrated by Starla (guitar), Ulysses (Drums), Pio (Synth), Om (Guitar/Vocals), and Pogo (Bass). The band had a short period of recognition in the underground mexican scene between the years 2004 and 2006, after some time the band went on hiatus and recently they announced they are working on new songs.

2.
UMAs music can be described as floating experimental electronic pop, mixing deep rhythms, bass sounds and haunting beautiful choir like vocal chants. Ella and Flo met during a turbulent summer in 2008 and since then got married, gave birth to UMA in 2012 and released their first EP via Seayou Records (AT) and Enraptured Records (UK). The EP was well received by the press, earning them a review by WIRE magazine amongst others.

With support from various angles such as a Silver Apples feature, Ella and Flo are building their own meticulous world of unusual melodies, off-the-wall electronic soundscapes in an atypical but infectious way. UMA just finished the recordings of to their first Studio Album, using a wide range of equipment that got recorded onto tape at Berlin’s Oogumboogum studios.
