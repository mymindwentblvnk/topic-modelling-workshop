There are multiple artists with this name:

1. Strident is an epic power metal band from Cape Town, South Africa.

Strident was wrought from Hell-forged steel in 2008. They first unleashed their sonic fury on the 30th of May of that year at the Klein Libertas Theater, in support of the mighty Kobus!. 

Frustrated by the lack of epic, melodic metal in South Africa, guitarists Deon van Heerden and George van der Riet decided to take it upon themselves to form the band they had always wanted to see: old-school, headbanging, sword-thrusting, guitar-solo-drenched epic melodic power metal. Enlisting the help of brothers Piet and Johan Delport and drummer Marcel Christie (as well as too many potential vocalists to count) they swore to leave no face unmelted in their quest for metallic conquest and glory.

Today, Strident stands as South Africaâ€™s defender of true steel, willing to live and die for their brand of heavy metal, in all its cheesy glory. Strident released their independent album "Oath" in October 2010. 

The current line-up is as follows:
Piet Delport - Bass Guitar & Backing Vocals
Christian Burgess - Drums
Deon van Heerden - Vocals & Lead Guitar
George van der Riet - Rhythm Guitar
Niell Schoeman - Guitar
Daniel Vollgraaff - Keyboards
