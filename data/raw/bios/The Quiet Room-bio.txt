2) The Quiet Room had a short run in the late nineties, releasing two albums on the Metal Blade label in 1998 and 2000. Musically they were a classic progressive metal band, drawing influences from Fates Warning and Dream Theater mixed with their own unique stylings. The band seemed to have it together but couldn't make it to the next level, and so they broke up in April of 2002. Several members were later seen in a followup band called Negative Four. That band lasted for a couple of years, even going so far as to record (but not release) an album, but they disbanded in August of 2005. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Quiet+Room">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
