Nathaniel Rateliff & The Night Sweats is a soulful American band formed in 2013 by singer and songwriter Nathaniel Rateliff.

Some artists undergo reinventions. What Nathaniel Rateliff accomplishes on his first LP with the Night Sweats — transforming himself from folk troubadour to funky soul bandleader — is a revelation. Rateliff comes on like Van Morrison fronting Booker T. & the MG's, reviving the glory days of the Stax label.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nathaniel+Rateliff+&+the+Night+Sweats">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
