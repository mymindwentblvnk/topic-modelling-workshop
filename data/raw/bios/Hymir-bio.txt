With the EP 'Perish' (2007), Hymir makes you experience the start of their musical journey into the sinister universe of dark atmospheric metal. Powerfull drums, bass and guitars are replenished by bombastic orchestral synthesizers and extreme aggresive vocals (lyrically influenced by the roman empire). Instantly promoted as “Recommended Metal Album” at the Boudisque cd-shops, 'Perish' provides Hymir a great entrance into the wide world of metal. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hymir">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
