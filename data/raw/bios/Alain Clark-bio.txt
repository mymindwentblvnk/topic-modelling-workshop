He also produced and wrote the song "V*kkenvuller", a dutch version of Eamon's hit "Fuck it" (I don't want you back). "V*kkenvuller" was sung by Simon and scored very high in the Dutch charts in 2004. That year, Clark won the Zilveren Harp. His second album "Live it Out" was released in 2007. The songs "This ain't gonna work", "Father and friend", "Blow me away" and "Fell in love" became big hits in The Netherlands.
