Abysm was a Death/Thrash Metal band from Ottawa, Canada. Formed in 2007, they had a very brief lifespan, but managed to release one official recording, simply entitled "Demo 2007" and a rehearsal. Only ten copies were initially pressed, hand-numbered 1-10, but more were pressed later.

Due to unfavorable circumstances involving members' absences from each other, the band finally decided to call it quits on December 25th, 2008.

Line-up:

Nathan Hartill - Vocals
Hadrien Churchill-Joly - Guitar
Joel Ladouceur - Drums
