Melodic death metal band from Belarus inspired by Scandinavian history and Norse mythology.

Alfar (Old Icelandic for "Elves") were, according to The Poetic Edda and later Sagas of the Icelanders, supernatural land-spirits that would receive offerings and worship. In the Prose Edda, though, their dwelling place, Alfheimr is said to be in the heavens. Historical cult of the Alfar appears to have been especially important in Sweden and South-Eastern Norway. the old Norse god Freyr is the divinity most closely associated with them. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Alfar">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
