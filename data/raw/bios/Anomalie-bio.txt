2) A classically trained and highly versatile keyboardist and producer based in the beautiful city of Montreal. He makes music infused with a combination of classical music, jazz, hip hop, funk, fusion and various electronic elements - sounds hectic but Anomalie pulls it off seamlessly as evidenced on his Lowtemp debut single Odyss√©e.
