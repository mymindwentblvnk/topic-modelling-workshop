Spiritual Demise was formed in 2007 by a bunch of serious metal maniacs. In 2008 they commenced recording of their debut LP, which they finished in March 2009. The title is "Between The Lines". Now, if you think that Polish bands cannot play serious true metal - you'd better think again. They're looking for a serious label, they take no shit. Really. It'll hurt if you try. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Spiritual+Demise">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
