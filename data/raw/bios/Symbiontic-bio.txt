By permanent entering the stages [at first with the help of the first promotion release], Symbiontic more and more became an energy-spreading live-act with a spell-binding performance. 

SYMBIONTIC performs an energized music style based on the symbiosis of brutal and fast, melodic, catchy and progressive death metal [in parts inspired by monuments like Morbid Angel, Pestilence, Death or At The Gates] - a perfect mixture of morbid melodies and groovy hooklines, never computable, stylistic sophisticated to a unique form: passionate
MORBID MELODIC DEATH METAL exclusively!

With "Vaya", the 5-piece death metal act Symbiontic strikes back with its final, long awaited and first official full length studio album. Ten energized tracks (including the typical instrumental interludes yet integrating new sound elements as e.g. oriental percussions, etc.) celebrate a well-balanced mixture of straight brutal, sombre, groovy and morbid melodic death metal rich of brilliant hooklines. Sophisticated song writing meets an unique complexity and ability in creating typical (for the band) harmonies and melody lines. Musical visions got driven by an embodiment of virtuosity and talent in keeping rawness (...not to forget at their overwhelming live performance!)
Symbiontic convinces with a unique sound dimension that everyone is able to recognize under a thousand other bands! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Symbiontic">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
