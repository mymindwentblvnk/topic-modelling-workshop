Chess Moves, music maker, creator, explorer out to sculpt, shape, weave, deliver variations of the Hip Hop Sound. Coming with spontaneity through poly-rhythm arrangements via a wealth of production tools, an off the edge and cuff presentation takes new wave-forms to surround and immerse with a generous helping of distortion within the musicality. Check the sounds for an excursion into a world of new sonic territory.
