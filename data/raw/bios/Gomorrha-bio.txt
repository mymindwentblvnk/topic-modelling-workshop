There are multiple artists under the name of Gomorrha.

1. Gomorrha is a progressive / hard rock group which existed between 1970 and 1973, releasing three albums: "Gomorrha" (1970), "Trauma" (1971) and the acclaimed "I Turned to See Whose Voice it Was" (1972).

2. The brutal death metal band Gomorrha was formed  in 1995.The actual line-up consists of   Jan Hempel(Voc/Git.), Robert (Git.) Florian Schairer (Drum) Rene´ Möller (Bas).

"Die Nacht des Todes", the first demo-tape includes 13 songs and was released in February 1997.
The response to this tape was very well and Gomorrha played their first gigs.

"Ready to Kill", the second tape, was released in November 1997 and Gomorrha played some more gigs.
We supported bands like Krisiun, Purgatory, Die Apokalyptischen Reiter, Postmortem, Pandemia, Root, Atanatos, Impending Doom, Dunkelgrafen and did also some headliner shows and our regional state was growing.

"Time of Apocalypse" is our debut CD and was mixed at The Rape of Harmonies Studio (where bands likes Impending Doom, Seirim have also recordet their CD´s) and was selling very well.
The gigs to support the debut CD became very  successful.Magazines like Eternity, G.U.C., Ablaze and some other international magazines wrote very good reviews of our debut-CD "Time of Apocalypse".
We also gave a lot of interviews in radioshows, for Austrian and various international magazines.

In August 2001 we released a CD with some new songs for promotion only.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gomorrha">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
