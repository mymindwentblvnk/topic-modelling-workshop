Agitation Free was a German avant-garde rock band. The band formed in 1967 with Michael "Fame" Günther (bass), Lutz "Lüül" Ulbrich (guitar), Lutz "Ludwig" Kramer (guitar) and Christoph Franke (drums). They were initially called Agitation, a name they chose at random from a dictionary. Later, they added the word free to the name becoming Agitation Free to reflect their live performance style.

After losing guitarist Axel Genrich to Guru Guru in 1970 and drummer Christopher Franke to Tangerine Dream in 1971, the band recruited Jörg "Joshi" Schwenke (guitar), Burghard Rausch (drums), and Michael Hoenig (keyboards). They released their debut album, Malesch in 1972 on the Music Factory label. Their tour through Egypt, Greece, and Cyprus inspired the album sponsored by the German Goethe Institute. Later that year, they performed at the 1972 Munich Olympics.

They released a second album in 1973, but the band disbanded in 1974.

The band reunited in 1998 and released River Of Return in 1999. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Agitation+Free">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
