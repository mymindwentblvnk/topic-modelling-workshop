1. Hedonist, otherwise known as Hiroki Otsuka,  is a Japanese multi-talented music engineer from Tokyo, who has experience in composing, arranging, recording, mixing, mastering, DJ'ing, VJ'ing, and much more. During his upcoming career, mastering became an interest for Hedonist after a year of DJ'ing in 2004, and in 2005 he began to focus on learning more about it while attending Shobi University of Music. A year after Hedonist became a part of a game music production team called i.o.sound contributing music for various games. He then began to delve deep into the independent music scene where he launched his label, Delights music. The very first compilation series, Linkup, was released off the label and has continued to discover many talented artists, some even being doujin in hopes of spreading the progressive sound that Hedonist wants to achieve.

2. A band from San Francisco composed of Doug Hilsinger  (guitar, throat) and the brothers  Maurus Fleischmann  (bass) and  Magnus Fleischmann (drums) that recorded an album, Manifester, and played some shows in SF and Europe in 1995. Their rock sound is raw, heavy, progressive and psychedelic borrowing its dynamics and atmosphere greatly from Doug's characteristic guitar style and vocals.
Doug has proliferated trough a series of projects such as Waycross, Bomb and Gifthorse.
