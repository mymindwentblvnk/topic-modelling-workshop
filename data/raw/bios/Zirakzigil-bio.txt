Zirakzigil is heavy progressive doom from Portland Oregon. 

Zirak-zigil was one of the great peaks in the Misty Mountains. It was one of the three Mountains of Moria under which lay the ancient Dwarf realm of Khazad-dûm. The other two great peaks were the mountains Caradhras and the Fanuidhol. Beneath them stood the great Dwarven city of Khazad-dûm, and on its peak stood Durin's Tower.

The Dwarves called the mountain-summit Zirak-zigil. In ancient times, they built the Endless Stair - a spiral staircase of many thousand steps - from the roots of the mountain up to its peak. On an eyrie atop the mountain, they built Durin's Tower. By the end of the Third Age, the stair and the tower were remembered only in legend.

Then, on January 23, 3019, Gandalf and the Balrog climbed the Endless Stair to the summit of the Silvertine. There they fought the Battle of the Peak, which lasted three days. During the battle, Durin's Tower was destroyed and the stairs were blocked. Gandalf the Grey died and was soon returned to life as Gandalf the White; the Balrog of Moria was finally destroyed. Gandalf was rescued from the Silvertine by Gwaihir the Windlord.
