2. Satanist (Rus) was a black metal band now known as Arisk Priest. The band consisted of two members, and they released four demos before their bass player was sentenced to 8 years in jail for murder.
As their ideology changed, the band's name was altered. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Satanist">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
