Tsunami Bomb was a punk rock band from Petaluma, California that formed in 1998 and broke up in October 2005. The band was started by bassist and songwriter Dominic Davi, who enlisted Kristin McRory as Tsunami Bomb's original vocalist. Davi met McRory in late 1997, when she joined the band Headboard on vocals.

In 2003 their song Invasion From Within' was featured in the American and European versions of the video game Disgaea developed by Nippon Ichi on the PS2.

Tsunami Bomb's original lineup consisted of 5 people, including a keyboard player named Oobliette Sparks who also contributed vocals (and remained with the band until 2001). Gabriel Lindeman played drums for the band's first few shows, but he did not join the band full-time until 1999. Kristin McRory left Tsunami Bomb in late 1998, and Davi recruited Emily Whitehurst shortly thereafter (Emily's brother, Logan Whitehurst was Davi's roommate at the time). 

In 2003, Tsunami Bomb's founding bassist and songwriter Dominic Davi was asked to leave the band due to personality and creative conflicts (and he would go on to form the musical group Love Equals Death on Fat Wreck Chords). He was replaced by Matt McKenzie. Mike Griffen, their guitarist since 2000, left the band in 2004 and was replaced by Jay Northington.

Their last releases as a band included their final album as Tsunami Bomb entitled, "The Definitive Act" 2004 and a live concert DVD entitled, "Live at the Glasshouse", in the The Show Must Go Off live music DVD in 2005 both on Kung Fu Records.

In late 2005, after years of touring and numerous line up changes Tsunami Bomb officially broke up, citing problems with the "business end of the music industry"
