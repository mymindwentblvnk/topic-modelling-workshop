The experiment known as “Operation Downfall” began in 2005 . Concealed from the world in a rundown testing facility on the outskirts of Los Angeles, four human subjects were exposed to the “B-Strain” virus. Now Mike Fountain (Vocals/Guitar), Robert Sherman (Guitar/Backing vocals), Eric Schuman (Bass/Backing vocals) and Chris Collins (Drums) set out to spread the infection to the rest of the world.

Influenced by the likes of Lamb of God, Machine Head, In Flames and Killswitch Engage, Operation Downfall brings a hard-hitting fusion of melody and primal rage to the metal scene. Their intense energy and progressive sound quickly spreads to claim new fans, known as the [INFECTED]. Rusty, makeshift medical props adorn their stage giving their live performances a grim and suspenseful ambiance. While supporting their debut album, “Virulent”, Operation Downfall has shared the stage with bands such as; Bleed the Sky, My Ruin, Warbringer and Strife.
