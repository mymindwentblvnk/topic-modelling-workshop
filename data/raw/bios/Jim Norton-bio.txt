Jim Norton is a silly goose. When he's not pinching the helmets of neighborhood children under a porch or driving around Manhattan looking for ladies of the evening, Jim Norton does damned funny stand up.

Jim is also third mic of the Opie and Anthony radio program on Sirius XM Radio. He also regularly appears on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.

Jim Norton was also voted Sweetest Boy in School, but couldn't attend the ceremony because he was in rehab. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jim+Norton">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
