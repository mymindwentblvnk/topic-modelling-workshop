Bas Jan are a London-based experimental post-punk trio. Musician and songwriter Serafina Steer, who is normally known as a harpist, started learning the bass guitar and writing with performance artist Jenny Moore in 2015. They recruited Sarah Anderson, and the trio became Bas Jan .

Their songs to date are written by Serafina Steer and indeed, they were going to be a new Serafina Steer album until Sarah Anderson and Jenny Moore's full powers triangulated the whole collaboration and BAS JAN was born. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bas+Jan">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
