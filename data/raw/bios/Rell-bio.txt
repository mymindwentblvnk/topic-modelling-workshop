Ladies may swoon over the tough-talking city boys, but in the end what they really want is an old-fashioned southern gentleman. A man who understands the importance of chivalry-- one who'll show up on the doorstep with a dozen long-stem roses just because, or will massage her feet after a long day at work. One who'll serve her favorite dinner by candlelight, or cater to her when she's sick. They want a brother who can make love to his woman every night, re-igniting all the fire and passion of their very first time. That's where the hypnotic, soulful and multi-talented RELL steps in. Hailing from the small, dusty town of Bowman, South Carolina, not only is RELL a certifiable vocal powerhouse, he's a bonafide gentleman. 

Exuding the amorous spirit and old-school charm of those who hail from below the Mason-Dixon line--soul legends such as Stevie Wonder, Al Green and Sam Cooke-- RELL's poignant, thoughtfully penned lyrics are the perfect compliment to his goosebump-inducing pipes and multi-octave rangeâ€¦ RELL is guaranteed to restore hope among soul aficionados weary of lewd lyrics and over-sexed R&B acts. 

The former South Carolina State pre-med student's sizzling debut has been a long time coming. The first male R&B solo artist signed to Roc-a-Fella Records, RELL got his first break in 1998, appearing in Jay-Z's rap cult flick Streets Is Watching, and contributing the feel-good club banger Love For Free to the movie's soundtrack. Going on to sing hooks for nearly every Roc-A-Fella MC since --including Jay's It's Obvious and Freeway's Victim Of The Ghetto-- and appearing on The Message featuring Mary J. Blige from Dr. Dre's classic Chronic 2001, RELL knew it was just a matter of time before he could introduce his sophisticated, seductively retro sound to the masses. 

I like speaking to the ladies on behalf of all the men out there, he explains of his confectionery ballads, most of which he wrote. I love the idea that a guy will hear what I'm saying, play it for his girl and say, 'You know what? That's how I feel about you, right there. That's what I'm trying to say. Sit down right here and press play,' he laughs. At the end of the day, I'm just the interpreter.
