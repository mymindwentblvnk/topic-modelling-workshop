Jess Mills is an English singer and musician, currently signed to Island Records, who has done collaborations with many UK Electronic Music producers including Photek, Distance and Breakage.

She grew up in Kentish Town, North London. At school there she met Niomi McLean-Daley, better known as Ms Dynamite, becoming friends and, "doing dodgy dance routines in assembly together."

After graduating from Sussex University, Jess began working in a local pub in order to fund a continued interest in music on the side. After a steady string of collaborations with various musicians throughout the '00s (including one with Dom Search from The Nextmen) she eventually got her real break touring with Leftfield in 2010.

She has worked extensively with drum and bass / dubstep producer Breakage, scoring a UK top 40 hit with the track "Fighting Fire."

Other tracks to be released in 2011 include the singles "Vultures" and "Live For What I Die For," as well as a cover of The Cure's 'A Forest' (of which Rob Smith himself has admitted he is a fan).

She has attracted interest from the Press including a feature to run in i-D magazine.

Her debut album will be released in 2012 by Island Records UK. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jess+Mills">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
