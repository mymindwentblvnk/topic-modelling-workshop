Vomicide now a five piece metal band from the NorthEast of England which formed in the early days of 2006, Vomicide are currently writing more of our own material and looking to support or Headline at venues around the UK.

We have a Keyboardist now. Unfortunately Winters Eternal Torture was recorded before we had a keyboardist, so the epic feel can only be enjoyed at our gigs.

So far we have a 3 Track demo entitled 'Ringmaster Of Wolves' which you can message us for and we'll probably give you a copy! The tracks listed are:

Enthralling the Hellfire Blazes
The Deceiver
Ringmaster Of Wolves

We also have our second E.P 'Winters Eternal Torture' which you can buy from us at any gigs for only 3 quid! the tracks listed are:

Ailment Of Faith
Winters Eternal Torture
Regaining What Turned To Dust
