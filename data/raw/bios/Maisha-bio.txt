2) Maisha is a melodic death metal band, they began in early 2006 in A Coru√±a, Spain. After expending some time making songs and rebuilding the line-up after our first singer Entrialgo left the band and the incorporation of our actual singer Pitu, we start doing our first shows. In January of 2007 we start recording in the J Soundworks studios our first demo, with 4 songs. We autoedit and began distributing it in July 2007 (DIY)
