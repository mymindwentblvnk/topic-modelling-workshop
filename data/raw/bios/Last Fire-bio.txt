Last Fire was formed inBudapest, Hungary, in 2008. The lineup from the beggining is: Péter Virág vocals and guitar, Tamás Becz solo guitar, Gábor Mayer drums, and Donát Kiss bass guitar  They play modern, heavy, thrashy, but always melodic music. They rarely cover some songs on our concerts, but it's not typical. Gigs are usually monthly, mainly in Budapest, but they also had concerts in other cities like Érd, Szigetszentmiklós, Tököl and Szolnok.

They released their first EP with 5 tracks, with the help and studio work of Gábor Kovács (Wisdom guitarist). Free tracks are available at their official website www.lastfire.hu.
