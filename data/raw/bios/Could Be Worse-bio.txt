Could Be Worse started out in Trondheim, Norway in late 2007, when Mikka Khan (Guitar/Vocal) and Adrian Tanem (Guitar/Vocal) decided to form a band. They were shortly joined by Jan Ove Furberg (Drums) and Sissel Schmelding Jacobsen (Bass).

A demo consisting of 3-5 songs was scheduled for a Q1/Q2 2010 release, but was cancelled when the band split in March 2010 because of disagreement within the group. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Could+Be+Worse">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
