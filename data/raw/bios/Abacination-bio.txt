Abacination (from Derbyshire, England and formed in August 2007) make angry music for angry people; a blend of metal which was forged as a violent mixture of thrash, hardcore, death and grindcore.

As members of now defunct thrash band MechanisM, guitarist Tom Bower and drummer Matt Bradley wanted to push themselves and play heavier, more technical music so decided to jam together in Tom's shed, covering songs by artists such as Machine Head and Misery Index. From these sessions came riffs and the idea to form a new band. When MechanisM split in mid 2007, Matt and Tom jumped at the chance to finally create the music they wanted, recruiting Adrian Morhulec, also from MechanisM, on bass duties. Long time friend, Gareth Croson filled the line-up as the second guitarist.

The music is aggressive, their lyrics are venomous and their message is clear. The world is full of liars, cheaters and hypocrites that feed on the blind ignorance of others. Without the masses being pre-occupied with reality TV shows and celebrity sex scandals, these people would become exposed for what they and become subject to a well deserved fall from grace.

Abacination's debut EP has been recorded and is set for release in April/May 2009. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Abacination">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
