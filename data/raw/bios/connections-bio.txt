1. Connections is a group of Columbus, Ohio underground rock lifers. Singer Kevin Elliott and guitarist Andy Hampel’s high school band, 84 Nash, was the first non-GBV-affiliated act to see release on Rockathon Records. Elliott’s brother, Adam, played drums and sang in the now-dormant noise-pop trio Times New Viking and guitarist Dave Capaldi played in the post-punk band El Jesus de Magico. 

Private Airplane is about as good a pass at 90s-style guitar rock as you’re liable to get anywhere outside of that decade. Jetting through 15 songs in just under 30 minutes, the record is undiluted by stinkers, throwaways, or noodly psychedelic interludes. It’s all hooks all the way through. A few songs even compete with themselves to deliver cathartic, sing-along-able moments. If you can only pick one part to shout out in the car during “1980 Called”, is it the chorus, the pre-chorus, or the part where Elliott just lists the album titles Pink Flag and Scarecrow? All three are simple melodies, delivered with sufficient conviction.



2. This instance of Connections is mixed up with tracks from the hungarian hip-hop group Connections.

Hailing from opposite ends of the Earth, Toni Kraetze (Germany) and Allan Reid (Australia) are Connections. Formed in February 2007 as a souvenier recording for Toni during a working holiday in Australia; Connections combine simple and energetic music with straight forward lyrics.

Currently based in Germany, Connections are working on an EP as a follow up to the 2007 demo with the help of Thomas Riechert (Something Inside, The Truth.) The EP, CAN WE ESCAPE, will be out mid year on What Remains Records. Keep your eyes on the Connections and What Remains myspace profiles for preview tracks. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Connections">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
