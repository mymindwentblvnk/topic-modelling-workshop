(1)Joe Effing Mayo AKA Genocyde has been making music since early 2009, playing with FL Studios at home in Rockford, IL. From Dance/Techno to "Rebel Pop", Genocyde has been trying to pinpoint where his skills and influences were best implemented.  He finally touched down on the genre that needed him most, Hip Hop. With a unique style, focusing mainly on flow and lyricism, Genocyde hopes to turn "the game" on it's head.
Genocyde is currently working on releasing his first mix tape, Genocyde Presents: Under The Influence Vol. 1, set to be release in the summer of 2013, showcasing the talents of many of his friends, including Souless, Career The Brain and Young Mike. Genocyde started Under The Influence with his younger brother and right hand man, Young Mike in early 2012.
