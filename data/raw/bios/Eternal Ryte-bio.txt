Formed in the spring of 1984. Eternal Ryte was the first west coast band signed by Pure Metal Records. Emerging from the growing Southern California Christian metal scene in the mid-eighties, Eternal Ryte was initially put together by founding members guitarist Bobby “Transformer” Smith, bassist Jon Ciccareli and drummer Mike Berry. When the band disbanded after their first album, Bobby Smith was invited to audition for Ozzy Osbourne after Jake E Lee left but did not get the gig. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Eternal+Ryte">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
