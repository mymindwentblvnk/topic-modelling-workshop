Utrecht, the Netherlands based thrashers Nuestros Derechos (meaning "Our Rights" in Spanish) were firmly rooted with one foot in a tradition of (thrash) metal and the other in the hardcore/punk scene.

In a basic rock 'n roll lineup of guitar, drums and bass, these two guys plus grrrl delivered engaged and very energetic thrash metal with some hardcore punk ethics between  2000 and 2014.

Their style of music is similar to international thrash icons like Slayer, Kreator, Exodus, DRI, and Dutch acts like Legion of the Damned (previously known under the moniker of Occult), Izegrim, Lunatics Without Skateboards Inc. (LWS), Flesh Made Sin, and Outburst.
