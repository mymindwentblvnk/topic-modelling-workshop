1) Hashem (Hebrew for "the name") was a psychedelic rock band formed in Wausau, Wisconsin, in the winter of 2007. 

The band, originally named High Priest, was founded by David O Keefe (guitar), Derrick Edmonston (bass), and Jordan Koch-Engstrum (drums) before eventually adding Bentley Gillman (organ/saxophone) and changing the name to Hashem. 

Hashem only ever managed to play a handful of shows, notable for their wall of sound gut wrenching volume, and long extended jams delving into the blues, Hendrix style voodoo, and the beauty of Neil Young's guitar tone, despite existing as a band for many months after their last show. 

The band released one posthumous album, the forty minute self titled album, containing only three songs in typical jam style.
