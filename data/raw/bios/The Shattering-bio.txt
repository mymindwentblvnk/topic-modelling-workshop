The Shattering is a highly technical death metal band, founded in 2001. Originating in the south of Sweden, the original lineup consisted of Andreas Wiberg and Robin Holmberg on guitar, Max Grahn on drums, Björn Pettersson on bass, and Martin Pedersen on vocals. In the beginning their style was less technical, and combining both death/black metal influences at times.

In 2003, vocalist Martin quit the band, and later went on to join Visceral Bleeding. Carl Jephson was brought in to replace him, and after a couple of demos they signed with the English label Retribute Records in 2004. During writing sessions for their debut album, Björn Pettersson was kicked out of the band. Therefore, bass parts were played by Robin and Max on the album. Entitled “The Shattering Begins”, and released in 2005, the album received much praise for its technical brilliance and melodic, yet brutal songs. 

Since the release, Carl Jephson has left the band, and the remaining trio have stated that The Shattering is on hiatus. Time will tell if we’ll hear more from this band.
