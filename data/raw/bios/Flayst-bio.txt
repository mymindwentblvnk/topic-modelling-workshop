The band was initially founded in 2005 by Jo, IsmaÃ«l, Nico, Phil and Olivier (previous vocalist). Fred (current vocalist) came into the band in 2008. Influenced mainly by bands like In Flames or Dark Tranquility, the band enhances their songs with electronic sounds and even a taste of rock / pop. After a live album in 2006 (Carnage at Manoir), a demo in 2008 (Dante's Hell) and their first album in 2011 (Possession) the band is preparing a new album for fall 2015. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Flayst">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
