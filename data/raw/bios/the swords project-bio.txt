The Swords Project was formed in late 1999 in Portland, Oregon.  Under this moniker, they released an ep, 2001's The Swords Project, which was followed two years later by their only full-length album, Entertainment Is Over If You Want It.  

In 2003, the band shortened their name to Swords.  In 2006, the band announced they would be breaking up. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Swords+Project">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
