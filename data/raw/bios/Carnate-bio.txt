Carnate is death metal band from Sibenik, Croatia, founded by drummer Vedran Zorić and bass player Ante Aužina in 2009. Guitar player Josip Perić joined them soon and they started with regular garage jamming. Šime Lokas joined on second guitar. After 2 years Josip left the band.
His place was filled by Ivan Duilo and band started to jam and reherse again. 
In the summer of 2011 the band started recording a demo. 
After a long search for good vocalist, finally Tomislav Šanić took that place and proved himself as a good death metal growler. 
They released 2 demo recordings in 2011 and 2012. First debut album called Terminus was released in October 2015.
