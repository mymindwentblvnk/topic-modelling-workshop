Rittz has been signed to Tech N9ne's "Strange Music" label since 2012. He is managed by Freddie "Scender" Burman and Jeremy "JDot" Jones


 Raised in Gwinnett County, Rittz embodies the same level of irony and self-conflict as his hometown. Born into a musical family, he, his twin sister and their brother had always been exposed to the inner workings of music. The fact that their parents were heavily into rock and roll ensured that the kids were always around instruments or in studios. The family moved from small-town Pennsylvania (Waynesburg) to the Atlanta outskirts when he was eight years old, and once Rittz got to junior high, his musical tastes evolved. Atlantaâ€™s booming bass and rap movement had traveled north on I-85 to get the entire metro area jumping. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rittz">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
