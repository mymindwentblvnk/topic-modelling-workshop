These are the first and third songs recorded in for a four-song concept EP. At this time, Krak is a recording designed to gain interest for this project and for myself as a solo artist. Krak as a project is an outlet for my more eccentric and frustrated musical notions that have been fermenting for quite some time. Although I've long been involved in the creative aspects of music for over a decade, be they with my former band Humus, or the band with which I currently perform (Elevator 22), I've longed to create something that is truly unique to my creative process. The first in what I hope to be a series of different projects is Krak. To streamline recording, and to reduce cost, I played all the instruments and vocals myself with the exception of drums and keys, which were programmed by me. Additional female vocals were performed by Lindsey MacDonald. Perhaps in the future I can gather some musicians to flesh out the band, but as of now this exists as a studio project only. This project was funded in part by the Ontario Art's Council.
