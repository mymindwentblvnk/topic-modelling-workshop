Bodine was a Dutch heavy metal band which was active from 1978 until 1984.
The band released three albums: Bodine (1981), Bold as Brass (1982) and Three Times Running (1983). Bodine debuted with Jay van Feggelen as the vocalist, who performed as the Barbarian in the album Into the Electric Castle by Ayreon. The creator of Ayreon, Arjen Anthony Lucassen (performing as Iron Anthony), tried becoming the lead singer of Bodine but was added as a guitarist instead. In 2012, Jay van Feggelen joined The Southside Blues Revue as lead singer under the alias of Jay Bodean, a clear reference to his Bodine past. The band is currently inactive. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bodine">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
