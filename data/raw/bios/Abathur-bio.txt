Abathur In old-Iranian mythology, a creature that acts as the judge of the dead. His name means something like 'he with the scales'. He weighs the souls of the departed and/or their deeds and determines accordingly if they are to be send to heaven or to the underworld. Among the ancient peoples of southern Iraq and southwest Iran, Abathur personifies the 'third life'.
