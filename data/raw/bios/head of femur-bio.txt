Head Of Femur is an American rock band based in Chicago, IL. Ben Armstrong (drums/vocals/keys), Mike Elsener (guitar/vocals) & Matt Focht (vocals/guitars/percussion) formed the band in November of 2001 & have since played in most of the United States and parts of Canada. Their first album, "Ringodom Or Proctor", was released by Greyday Productions in August of 2003 to critical acclaim. Their second album, "Hysterical Stars", featured thirty musicians playing giddy, highly complex & densely orchestrated mini-suites that earned comparisons to the Beach Boy's "Smile", the Zombie's "Odyssey And Oracle" & the Flaming Lips "Soft Bulletin". It was released in May of 2005 to more critical acclaim. An EP of more rock-based alternate versions & cover songs called "Do The Tavern & Other Tall Tales" was released digitally in November 2005.

Recording for the third Head Of Femur full-length, "Great Plains", began in April of 2006 and was completed in March of 2007. In comparison to the first two albums, the arrangements are more finely-tuned and relatively stripped-down; the songs more thematically and musically focussed. Less prog; more rock. The lineup includes the original three members plus Nick "The Chancellor" Westra on bass, Tyson Thurston on keys/guitar, Colby Starck on percussion and backing vocals and a fine string quartet & the best horn section in Chicago. The six months spent touring in 2005-06 are reflected in the more band-oriented approach to recording and the dudes couldn't be more excited about finishing the record!

Over the years, the live lineup has ranged from three members to twenty-one, but has been a steady five-piece since November of 2005.  They have toured with Wilco; Dr. Dog; Architecture In Helsinki; Bright Eyes; Rilo Kiley; The Spinto Band; The Bruces; M Ward and more. Head Of Femur enjoys regional food & often eats to be funny. They like to dance 2-Step at The Broken Spoke in Austin, TX and drink at the Whirlaway in Chicago. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Head+of+Femur">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
