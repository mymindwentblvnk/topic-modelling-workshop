Haiku Hands, the elusive crew of artists who’s in influence can be felt across live performance, visual art and production exploded onto the scene with their irresistibly danceable single “Not About You”.

The unapologetic Australian collective have quickly earned a fierce reputation for themselves from their formidable and rambunctious live performances that lead audience after audience into utter pandemonium. Last year slaying sets at Falls, St Jerome's Laneway, The Plot, Wonderland Scarehouse Tour, BigSound, One Day, Sunday x Red Bull Academy, Pitch and Panama Festivals.

Working with some of Australia’s finest writers and producers, such as El Gusto (Hermitude), Joelistics, Jaytee Hazard and Lewis Can Cut, Haiku Hands curate, perform and collaborate to form genre bending songs with influences from hip hop, pop, electronic, dance and disco.
