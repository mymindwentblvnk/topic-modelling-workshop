Darkest Insania are a young melodeath band born on January 2006 in the south of Italy. They started playing songs of their favourite bands especially from the gothic and death metal scenes. After some concerts, in which they shared the stage with a lot of bands from the south of Italy, they recorded their first self-produced demo cd composed of four original songs at the Soundland Studio of Gabriele Ciullo in Castro (LE, Italy) in the months of April â€“ May 2007. They carry on writing and playing their favourite kind of metal, mixing the fury and the melody of music with melancholy tone but at the same time with hopeful lyrics. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Darkest+Insania">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
