Thrash Core Fanatics or T.C.F. for short is a furious fast thrash/crossover band featuring long time friends Rob Slaughter (INCREMENTAL) and Hans a.k.a. “Hans Hostile” (ENFORCER). Rob and Hans met nearly 10 years ago at the University of Professional Education in The Hague. Quite soon it was obvious that both shared big enthusiasm for thrash and speed metal. At the time Rob played in a thrash metal band called PAVEWAY while Hans was playing in a punkband. After Hans heard some of the stuff Rob recorded (on an old school tape multitracker) they decided Hans should give it a try since PAVEWAY was in search of a second guitarist. A lot of songs and gigs later Hans was asked to leave the band and quite soon after PAVEWAY was history. However Rob and Hans never lost contact and even though they both moved on with other bands they remained close friends. In 2006 Hans recorded INCREMENTAL’s (Rob’s current band) second demo and during those sessions the idea was born to start up an uncomplicated, fun, fast and furious thrashcore project. 10 songs (with a total playing time of 15 minutes) were written in just a few rehearsals and were recorded during the course of 2007. After that Hans & Rob decided that these recordings (dubbed the “Core ’88” demo) would be released as download only since it was time to make T.C.F. a ‘real’ band. Young talented guitar player “Noise Gate” Nick Polak (Ex-Speedchaser) was asked to join the band and Hans would take up the role of bassplayer/singer/frontman. From early summer 2008 the band has been rehearsing and writing new songs and with the new year upon us T.C.F. is ready to enter the stage. The first gig has been planned for end of March and the band is planning to do a lot more so keep checking this site.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/T.C.F.">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
