Death Cult was a post-punk outfit who formed in 1984 in England when The Southern Death Cult's Ian Astbury joined forces with Theatre of Hate's Billy Duffy; Jamie Stewart joined on bass, and Ray Mondo on drums. Mondo soon left however, and was replaced by Nigel Preston. After recording two singles (Brothers Grimm, Gods Zoo) and one radio session, the band changed its name to The Cult. A number of Death Cult songs would go on to feature on the first Cult album, Dreamtime, albeit in a more polished, rockier form. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Death+Cult">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
