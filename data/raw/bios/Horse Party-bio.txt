Horse Party hail from Bury St Edmunds, UK .

They formed when Shannon (drums) and Seymour (guitar/vocals) got drunk together in a church and sent Ellie (guitar/vocals) abusive messages, ordering her to join a band whose primary goal would be to make or lose a million pounds.

Bound together by a shared love of Bjork, Fugazi, Cat Power and terrible films, the threesome began playing together in September 2012.
