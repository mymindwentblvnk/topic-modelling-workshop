During many nocturnal hours of isolation, a call into the infinite and ever-changing darkness was answered, as the entity of Impaled Martyr was summoned from chaos by Desecrator in the year 2011. With disgust and contempt for the human race as a whole, the war on organized religion, mainstream culture and media, and the filthy human race has been declared as the first assault was launched with the demo "Through The Pale Fog." 

 Through Desecrator's warpath, he recruited his long time friend Lupus. Sickened by what this filthy world has become, and the path most "black metal" bands are currently taking, Impaled Martyr will never conform or be manipulated, regardless of what the filthy human swine would say, and will march onward, raging war on those who stand in the way! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Impaled+Martyr">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
