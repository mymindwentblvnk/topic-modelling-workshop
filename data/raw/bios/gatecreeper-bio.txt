Gatecreeper is a death metal band from Arizona.  Arizona newcomers Gatecreeper deliver 9 monstrous songs of low-end, old-school death metal on their savage debut album Sonoran Depravation.  Having devastated the underground since their formation, Gatecreeper now unleash their first full-length, produced by Ryan Bram at Homewrecker Studios and mixed by Kurt Ballou (Converge, Nails, Black Breath) at God City Studios.  Sonoran Depravation tears and chugs through 30+ minutes of crusty, doom-soaked death metal at its most infectious and uncompromising with a massive sound that calls to mind the classic Swedish buzz-saw attack of Dismember and Grave mixed with the impeccable groove of Obituary and Bolt Thrower. Gatecreeper are here to carry the death metal torch for a new generation and will shake your foundation to its core. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gatecreeper">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
