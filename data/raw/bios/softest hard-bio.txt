This woman is beautiful! I couldn’t figure out her real name no matter how much I tried- she goes by Softest Hard. She has one of the most gorgeous, sultry looks I’ve seen in awhile. Her long, dark hair and pouty lips gives her a very sexy vibe, even through the photos. She is currently an L.A. transplant but was born in Burlington, VT and raised in Raleigh, NC. Not afraid to show off her blunt smoking habits, she has some of the most dope photos in her portfolio. She has worked with some of the worlds best photographers including Van Styles. Not only does she has an amazing galley, she makes incredible music, the whole package if you will. From her covers, beats, mixes, and songs she definitely can set the right mood. She is amazing live, and give the chance going to her shows are a must, she is definitely entertaining and fun to watch, fills the room with amazing vibes and she knows what she is doing on the boards. Not every day do you come across someone as beautiful as her who DJS because its something she is passionate in, and not being of hype and trend. So, Big thank you to Softest for keeping it real and just being yourself.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/softest+hard">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
