There is more than one band called JUKE.

1. JUKE is a 3 strong band, Alex on fuzz bass, Dan on synth keys, and Damian on pounding drums all grinding with unhinged energy. A fuzzy synth rock mesh born out of drunken jams.

Born in the small town of Whitton, near Twickenham, Alex, front man of JUKE, would gradually go against the Baptist life his mother and father had planned out for him. Throughout his teens Alex followed the grunge scene, Mudhoney, Nirvana to the more abstract, Meat puppets, Dinosaur Jnr and alike, and found them to be an influence lyrically an dynamically, but with this he toyed with Depeche Mode, Soft Cell, Suicide, and other off-kilter bands that took pop melodies and twisted them, Alex was drawn to the Lo-fi minimalist elements, which brings you to these tracks, a home grown offering, that marries bass driven euphoria with anthemic melodies. JUKE has been rehearsing hard in a Hounslow industrial estate and now feels it can take the stage.

2. JUKE is also the name of a four piece cover band based in Leicester, UK. Formed by front man Luke Higgins in 2005 the band played venues across the Leicester area every week. Other members include David Tregoning (Piano/Vocals), Max Perryment (Bass) and Calder McLaughlin (Djembe). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Juke">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
