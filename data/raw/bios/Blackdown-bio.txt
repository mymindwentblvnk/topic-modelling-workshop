Blackdown is an alias of Martin Clark. He is a well-known documenter of the Dubstep music scene and writes his own blog on http://blackdownsoundboy.blogspot.com. Aside from this he is also a DJ/producer of Dubstep. In comparison to more extreme forms of Dubstep, his style of production could be described as ambient or calm with little “dark” influences but still always with heavy emphasis on the bass line. Blackdown is currently signed to Keysound Recordings and to date has had three records released; two of which were with another Dubstep artist called Dusk. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Blackdown">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
