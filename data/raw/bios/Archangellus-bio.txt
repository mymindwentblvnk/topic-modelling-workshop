Archangellus came to life by the ashes of Brazilian Behemoth in 1994. They'd changed the name probably because the most famous Behemoth from Poland. They'd recorded a promo and after signing with Cogumelo (the same label that released Sepultura and Sarc√≥fago) the band released the album Magnus Ominis Umbra in 1995. After that the band called it quits but it's not certain when.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Archangellus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
