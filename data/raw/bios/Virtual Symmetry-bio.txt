Gerald Becker released a series of tunes in the early 90's on Eye Q Records, Sven Vaeth's seminal frankfurt trance label. He later released a few harder edged tunes on Eye-Q's sister label, Harthouse. 

Gerald still lives and works in Frankfurt, but has not released any new music in many years. His last public performance was at one of the Remember the Omen parties in Frankfurt a few years ago.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Virtual+Symmetry">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
