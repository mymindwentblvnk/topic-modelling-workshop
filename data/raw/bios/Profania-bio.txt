Profania is a four piece metal band from the Drammen area, Norway with four memebers:

Jan Pinslund: Lead vocals and guitar.
Christer Borud: Lead guitar.
Espen Ris√∏: Drums.
Kyle Sevenoaks: Backup vocals and bass.

Profania has been around since 2004, with three demos under their belt. Their latest release New Assassin made a big hit with the fans, getting them a larger listener audience and made it able for them to play support for both Paul Di'Anno and Norwegian thrash legends Witchhammer.

Their style is what they call Progressive Thrash, from fast paced thrash riffs that take a left turn into clean passages and swung time signature changes, the music keeps you interested and on your toes.

The band have big ambitions for what they do, they are serious and have no intention of quitting. Their debut album is in the works and fans of the band await it with anticipation. 

The band will be featured on the RadioScream Los Angeles debut metal compilation CD.
