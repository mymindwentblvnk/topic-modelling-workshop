Many bands are made. Others simply come into being. But Pledge Defiance has been forged. Forged through very real suffering, turmoil, and hardship…

The band have lost previous members to a number of unfortunate circumstances, the most notable being the loss of former vocalist Andrew Keith Brecher to a brain embolism just a few months ago.

Now only four remain. Four dogged, determined and hardened individuals who want nothing more than to avenge their fallen comrade and to destroy all those that have come against them in the past…

The new machine is here. Neither death nor sadness nor fury will stop it. Events of cataclysmic proportions are about to happen and the band seem to have reached their final painful evolution.

Good bands are not opposed and face few hardships. But legendary bands must be taken to the edge of the precipice, pushed to their very limits and either continue or face total obliteration.

Pledge Defiance is not dead. And it will never die…this reign of terror has only just begun...
