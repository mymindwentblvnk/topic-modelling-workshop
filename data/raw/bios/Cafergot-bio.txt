CAFERGOT was initiated somewhere around 2003 by Hafeez and
Bai Grinder. Grindcore is Cafergot's brand of music. The music has some
mixes from other genres as well but the essence of brutality, speed and
melodic are maintained.

Some of 2007's planned activities are as follows :

1. Tribute to Sil Khannas 2007- "Salutant to the King"

2. Morggorm Compilation 2007 - "Mutation From Devastation" Vol. 3

3. Cafergot Promo CD 2007- "Deceive, Execute, Murder"

We've played in several gigs here in Malaysia. The first gig was at Paul's
Place in Damansara Uptown,somewhere August 2004. Consequent gigs
were at Nilai and some parts of Kuala Lumpur like Crizz Club, My Friend's
Corner and Paul's Place.
There have been lots of inquiries about the planned records, stuffs,
merchandizes, overseas gigs and so forth. We thank you for all the support and enthusiasm extended to us, nevertheless, apologies for the delay.
There have been lots of job and study commitments that we had to
complete earlier on. We are currently working to honor previous
commitments made. Rest assured that we will be posting frequent
updates and latest on goings to all.
