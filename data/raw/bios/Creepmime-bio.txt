Creepmime was a Dutch technical death metal band, with some doom influences. The band was formed in 1991, in Leiden, Netherlands, eventually settling on the line up, with Rogier Hakkaart, Andy Judd, Marja Koelewijn and Gerrit Koekebakker. They released one demo "Anthems for a Doomed Youth..." (1992) and two full-length albums "Shadows" (1993) and "Chiaroscuro" (1995).

Soon after the release of  "Chiaroscuro" in 1995 the band fell apart. In 1997, Giezen, Van der Graaf en Brama, restarted Creepmime and started writing new songs and recording a new demo CD. However, due to the drummer suffering a knee injury, the band collapsed again in 1998. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Creepmime">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
