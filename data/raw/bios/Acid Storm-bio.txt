São Paulo Thrashers originally formulated under the banner Exterminator in 1986. Acid Storm lead singer Robson Goulart was previously with the renowned Harppia whilst bass player Chico Comelli held credits with MX. For the band's sophomore release, 1990's 'Last Day Of Paradise', Acid Storm enrolled new frontman Mario Astorg Pastore. However, in 1992 Pastore decamped, subsequently heading up Revenge, Tailgunner, Delpht and Sacred Sinner, and Acid Storm welcomed back Goulart to the vocal role. Surreally Goulart then backed out again during 1995 and Pastore resumed his position. The 'Twilight Zone' demo emerged in 1997.
Acid Storm credited drummer Fábio Buitvidas also worked with Engrave and Judas Priest's cover band Hell Patrol. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Acid+Storm">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
