There are 3 bands named Merlot:

1) Warren Daly and Philip Butler are known as 'Merlot' (since 2002). They produce electronica and more. Layering synths on downbeat rhythms, which are quirky and slightly off-kilter. Phillip currently lives in South East Asia seeking new sounds and food, but the best he can find is cheese. 
Warren has DJ'd since 1993. He now devotes more and more time to running Invisible Agent Records. On the production side he concentrates on collaborating with Phillip and for the past number of years they have worked on a number of project.
