Sagorah was founded by Iwan and Julian N. in 2013 in Luttach, South-Tyrol, Italy.
Julian G. and Andreas followed the Metal call of the early Sagorah demo songs and became members. After a long search for a bass player, Sagorah found Michael Seeber, who started his carreer in the band in summer 2015.
Julian G. quit the band in November 2015 and Dany Slaviero took his place as the second lead guitarist.

SAGORAHs first album was released on 20th February 2015 and the band is touring through Italy and Austria to promote their first release.

SAGORAH planned new studio recording session in March and will release their second album on 23rd April 2016 during their Release Show.
