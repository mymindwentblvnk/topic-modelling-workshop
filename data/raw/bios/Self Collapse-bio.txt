"Self Collapse. Now, I don't know much about these guys but I do know they play a rather interesting kind of Technical Death Metal, why? because they add hardcore and progressive elements to it, maybe for some of you this isn't new (neither for me) but the catch is, that these guys blend it so well, that at some points you don't realize you're listening to deathcore in essence, because of the main hardcore element (breakdowns) are pretty damn fucking nailed (not too many breakdowns on this one), like, because these guys seem to know what the fuck they're doing, and not just insert a generic breakdown, so what these guys do, is create catchy and original breakdowns. So you will never be bothered about that, in fact, if you always thought breakdowns were shit, you may change your opinion when you listen to this. Vocally, you will not complaint, as the vocalist pulls off some nice gutturals and harsh hardcore screams, it sounds awesome in my opinion. Drums are also pretty fucking nailed, very technical, powerful and fast. Recommended for any deathcore and tech death fans" <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Self+Collapse">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
