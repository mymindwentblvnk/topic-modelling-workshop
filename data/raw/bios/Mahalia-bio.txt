Mahalia  (born Mahalia Burkmar) is an English singer, songwriter and actress, based in Birmingham.

Head Space, her debut EP, is a collection of songs written in the summer of 2011, as she developed her skills on the guitar and as a songwriter. The songs, inspired by the feelings for a special person, touch on love and relationships through unfamiliar eyes, and through their simple approach represent the starting point of a creative journey for a girl from Leicester. Head Space is a testament to Mahaliaâ€™s beautiful, distinctive voice and unpretentious lyricism; a series of songs that are authentic and emotional. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mahalia">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
