The foundation of Zangryus grew from an idea from Ash in the mid 1990s to create music as an eastern sibling duo within a metal band. This involved Smana (vocals) as the front-person and Ash as the guitarist for live shows, with a bassist and drummer providing the rhythm section. 

All the music and lyrics have always been written exclusively by Ash, and all the music on the recordings has been played by Ash, with vocals being shared between Ash and Smana. Nick and Damien have joined the live line-up for 2007 and beyond, and will hopefully feature on recorded material soon. 

After a year spent relocating, Zangryus has had two new additions to the "family" in the shape of Damien on the drums and Nick on the bass. We are looking forward to many gigs together.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Zangryus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
