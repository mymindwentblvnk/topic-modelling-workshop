Sweet Cicada is the Doom/Groove/Stoner Rock project
from West Virginia's doom prodigy, Dan Lively.
A (3) song EP called SWITCH was released in 2004
which really deserves to be heard.
Stellar songwriting and an excellent sense of THE RIFF
are the hallmarks of Dan's doom calling.

Dan had once squashed the sticky bug,
but it has now resurrected and shall fly again...
A full length LP/CD is on the way, due out late 2007.
