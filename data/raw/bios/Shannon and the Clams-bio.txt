Shannon and the Clams is an American indie garage punk quartet based in Oakland, California. Known for a vintage sound that incorporates elements of doo-wop, classic R&B, garage psych, and surf, the band has drawn comparisons to both Buddy Holly and 1960s girl groups.

Like a Beach Rock revival, Shannon and the Clams take you back to a time when Judy and Johnny were your favorite worst couple, with the help of some very heartbreaking background vocals and guitar riffs of which The Beatles would be proud. Influences like The Beach Boys, The Shangri- La's, The Ronettes,  and Patsy Cline shine through in songs like "When You're On", with front woman Shannon crooning like a scorned Leslie Gore, but with a rough unpolished edge inspired by the likes of The Cramps, Bad Brains, and fellow beach bum Nobunny. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Shannon+and+the+Clams">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
