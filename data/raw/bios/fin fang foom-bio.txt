Fin Fang Foom, an indie rock group, were formed in Jacksonville, Florida, in 1996. The band consists of Michael Triplett on guitar, Michael Glass on drums, and Edwin Sanchez on bass.

In 1997, after suffering the shattering setback with the loss of drummer and comrade, Peter Enriquez, and replacing him with Michael Glass, the band found a new style, finished the first single, and concentrated on touring around the East Coast to present their music.

In 2001, the band released their first full-length album called, Texture, Structure, and the Conditions of Moods. In 2003, their second album, With the Gift Comes the Curse, was released. Both of the albums are a dark aggregation of genres and tones, both piercing and soothing, with more stress put on the instrumental side of their music, accompanied by Edwin's meandering vocals.

The band is now recording an EP with a new member, Cynthia, who is playing cello. They have scheduled a tour in Japan in the fall of 2006. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fin+Fang+Foom">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
