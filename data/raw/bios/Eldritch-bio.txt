1) Eldritch are an Italian progressive metal band who have been around since the early/mid 1990's. Their sound could be described as a blend of new metal with the technique and dynamics of the old-skool disciplines.
Having started out with a predominantly progressive sound - their 1998 "El Nino" release is considered essential listening to any rock/metal fan.
