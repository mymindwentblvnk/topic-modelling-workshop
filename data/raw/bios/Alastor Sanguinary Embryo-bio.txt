Costa Rican Black Metal band ALASTOR SANGUINARY EMBRYO first emerged in San José during July 1995, debuting in 1997 with the demo tape 'The Howling Creatures Of The Night'. In spite of the extreme Metal nature of the material this demo would be book ended by intro 'Odio' and outro 'Quimera', both classical guitar tracks composed and performed by Roger Castillo. Following up would be the album 'Eternal Tears Through Asmodeo’s Blackened Flames'. To promote this new material, the band briefly toured El Salvador during 1999, including a special guest position at a major festival, with further concerts ensuing in Nicaragua and Panama. The group line up would feature frontman Abrahkkan, co-vocalist Perséfone, guitarist Luis "Demonhead" Rodríguez, bassist Glaciabolous, keyboard player Leonard with Grackons Damaethyam on the drums.

The 2004 ALASTOR SANGUINARY EMBRYO line-up for the album 'D.E.M.O.N.' saw Abrahkkan, Rodríguez and Grakons Damaethyam joined by bass player Adolfo B. and keyboard player Aeon.
