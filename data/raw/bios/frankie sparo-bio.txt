Frankie Sparo is the pseudonym of Chad Jones, a singer/songwriter from Victoria, British Columbia now based in Montreal. He released an album and EP in 2000 as a solo artist before enlisting Nadia Moss for the recording of his second, after which he toured with her, Jessica Moss and Scott Levine Gilmore (the latter two his Constellation Records labelmates as part of A Silver Mt. Zion). Jones put Sparo on ice in 2004 but returned supporting Handsome Furs at a handful of dates in March 2007. Jones is now working on a new band called The Witchies who played their debut gig at the Suoni Per Il Popolo Festival in Montr√©al in June. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Frankie+Sparo">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
