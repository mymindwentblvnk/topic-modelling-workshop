The Dead 60s formed in Liverpool, United Kingdom in 2003, they comprised of Matt McManamon (Vocals, Guitar), Ben Gordon (Guitar, Organ), Charlie Turner (Bass Guitar), Bryan Johnson (Drums).  Named after the saying 'Dead 60s sounding' from Liverpool.  Their name was a two fingers up to the usual happy pop tunes that originate there.

Their sound was an eclectic mixture of punk rock, large meoldies and reggae bass lines. They had been compared with The Clash and The Specials, with influences also including King Tubby.

Their debut album was released in the US in May, Japan in June, and the UK in September 2005.

The follow up album 'Time To Take Sides' was recorded in New York early in 2007 with Strokes & Regina Spektor producer David Kahn.

The band split early 2008 stating that they 'felt like the band had run its course'.
