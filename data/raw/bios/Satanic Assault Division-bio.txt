Satanic Assault Division sprung forth from the blackness of the small Danish island Funen in early 2012. The band spat out the demo Erasing Religion which was soon followed by the Christ-raping full length album March to Victory. Satanic Assault Division has now played various concerts in Germany, Hungary and Denmark with bands such as Negura Bunget, Archgoat, Bornholm, Merrimack and the legendary Mayhem. All the music for the band’s second full length album Kill the Cross has now been recorded at Endarker Studio Sweden with Magnus “Devo” Andersson from Marduk. Fans can expect a seasoned band with an extreme and aggressive sound that reflects the confidence and musicianship of the strongest line-up to date. Kill the Cross is the culmination of months of hard work, and will rip the audience apart!
