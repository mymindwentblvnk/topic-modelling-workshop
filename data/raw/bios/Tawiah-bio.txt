If you’ve seen Tawiah, you’ll know it. You might think you know her because you recognise the smile as wide as the equator, or the incredible off kilter dress sense, or you may remember seeing a show stopping performance on stage with Mark Ronson, as she’s the only live female vocalist at his gigs. But none of these things is the real reason you know her. You’ll know her because of the voice, or more to the point - her voice.

Although she’s only 21 years old the ex-Brit school student has been showcasing her vocal talents for many years and has been the one to watch for an equal amount of time. Battersea born, this new rising star has been crafting her talent in the studio and on stage since an early age everywhere – from doing the rounds as backing vocalist to touring internationally (with Mark Ronson and Clive de Lowe), to making her mark on stage as a solo artist in her own right. And it shows. Often labeled the most talented UK vocalist around at the moment by her peers, her growing fan base have been waiting for her debut release for what seems like forever. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tawiah">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
