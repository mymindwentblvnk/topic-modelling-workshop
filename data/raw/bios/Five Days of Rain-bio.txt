This band was build up in summer 2004 by Enrico (Cigo), Fabrizio (Joseph), Danil and Filippo and Marco (Santa). 

Between Oct & Dec 2006 we recorded a promo/EP (it sounds like Hatebreed, Lamb of God or Killswitch Engage) at Authoma Studios (Federico Pennazzato).

During winter '07 we focus on a Death-Core sound made of swedish riffs, heavy neck-break mosh breakdown and death fucking metal. Unfortunately we had to change two members, finding a stable line-up with Loris and Davide (Peglia).

We started a partnership with Mass Murder Inc. Booking and Miasma Booking. During 2008/2009 we played in a lot of gigs called "WE ARE DEATHCORE TOUR"(with such band like All Shall Perish, Modern Age Slavery, Neaera) in many cities of our country. During Oct 2009 we signed with RISING RECORDS (UK) for the release of our ddebut album, called "Taste My Breath After The Fallout" <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Five+Days+of+Rain">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
