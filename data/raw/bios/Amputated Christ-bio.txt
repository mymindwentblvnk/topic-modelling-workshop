First started in early 2004, recorded four demos which now are mastered and will appear on the 2006/2007 release of Rotting Savior. The band never went anywhere after 2004 cause of fighting within the band itself. Amputated Christ is one of the most blasphemous bands in the state of Kentucky. Tracks, such as 'Mutilation Of Christ', resemble the old days of Darkthrone, which inspires the fuel to this band. Bands like Crimson Moon, Nunslaughter, Darkthrone, and Dark Funeral are some of the main influences of the band.
