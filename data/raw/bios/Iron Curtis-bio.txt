Iron Curtisâ€™ pieces originate in a place simultaneously tuned to the sounds of Detroit, Chicago and Hamburg. In his home town of Nurnberg, Johannes Paluka is more familiarly known under his surname, which he goes by at the turntable. Intertwining Deep-House with soulful Techno in a disturbingly enchanting manner, his sound moves in the equilibrium of reduced, but never minimal. Flashes of kitsch brighten the dark universe of Iron Curtis, but fail to interfere with the melancholy subtext. Profound music for the dance floor! He is currently living in Berlin and releasing for Mirau, Morris Audio, JackOff, Retreat, and Mule Electronic.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Iron+Curtis">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
