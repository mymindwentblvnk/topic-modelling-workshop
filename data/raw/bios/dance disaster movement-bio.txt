2001-2005

Through a strange telepathic connection, Matt Howze met Kevin Litrow in 1999. It was a cold stormy night in California. 
A few nights before, Kevin was seduced by pulsating repeating rythms in a dream. The words "brain beat" kept appearing in bright colors, which then would slowly transform into the words "body beat." He didn't wake up in a frenzy. Instead he awoke with the big question, "What the fuck does "body beat" mean?" The following day he was so weirded out he decided to go have his dreams interpreted by a dream specialist. When he arrived, there was a line with a 45 minute wait out the door. 
He sat quietly, thinking about last night's rhythms wondering why they are effecting him. He then began to choke on cigarette smoke. The smoke came from a tall and slender gentleman across the room. 
The gentleman was wearing a plain white shirt, with black slacks and ripped converse. He was trembling and smoking cigarette after cigarette. A concerned woman walked up to this man and asked him if he was alright. "I can't stop thinking about those drones," he said to the woman. "These repetative drones have been seducing my mind for the past five nights straight. 
They're like bright colored lasers that keep shooting at my head and I fight these drones by hitting them like a drum." After hearing this Kevin knew he had to confront this gentleman. He walked over and introduced himself and learned that this gentleman's name was Matt Howze. 
They conversed about music, dreams, drones, rhythms, oscillations, keyboards, gutars and bands. They both decided that the line was a waste of time and left to go get coffee.
