Having formed in 1995 and led by guitarist David Rairan, Purulent was the first Colombian band to play grindcore. In spite of a number of line-up changes, they managed to release two albums, Patologia Grotesca and Garavito's Pedophilia Tales, due in 1999 and 2001 accordingly, and with them gave an inspiration to many other Colombian grindcore formations that followed. Having some elements of death metal, the music itself containted a kind of pure grindcore with pitch-shifted vocals and raw guitars, reminiscent of, maybe, Disgorge (USA), Leukorrhea and Jasad.

On the 3rd of June, David Rairan died in a tragic car accident, what undeniably forced the rest of the band to put Purulent on hold. Since then nothing ever has been heard about. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Purulent">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
