Mindwarp Chamber, based in Chicago, IL. is comprised of musicians well respected in the industry. They have all joined forces, blending their unique styles to create a very progressive and melodic style of music, filled with technical prowess, mellifluous passages, and displays of virtuosity.

In the few years since their formation in 2006, Mindwarp Chamber has gained quite a following. Vocalist Scott Huffman and Keyboardist Ed ‘Shreddy’ Bethishou formed the band out a desire to create music with no boundaries or compromises. After a few initial lineup changes, Brent Sullivan, bassist extraordinare, stepped to the fore and help to write what went on to become a nominee for Best Metal Album of 2008, Delusional Reality. Brent is now pursuing various musical projects in Florida, replaced by the superbly talented Marc Malitz, in early 2009. Drummer Paul Kilkenny, stepped in shortly before the recording process for Delusional Reality, and lent an extremely progressive rhythmic feel to the band. In early 2008, Mike Cerna joined the band as the guitar player. They are working furiously on the follow up album to the critically acclaimed Delusional Reality. The new direction of the band is more diverse, complicated, and indeed, progressive. With a solid lineup now, Mindwarp Chamber is ready to take its place amongst the new wave of progressive metal bands that are revolutionizing the scene. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mindwarp+Chamber">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
