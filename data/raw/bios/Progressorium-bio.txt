Progressorium was formed in 2006 in Germany. They met a few times just for playing in the sessionroom. After a few meetings they noticed that they sound very well. They decided to make the project more serious. After a short time, they created their own songs. 

In October 2006 they had their first live gig and the crowd really liked them. After that there was another gig in a pub. In March 2007 they played the supporting act for the Australian musician Gwyn Ashton. The gig was big success.
