Black Math Horseman was a mellow, atmospheric doom metal outfit that comprised bassist and vocalist Sera Timms (Black Mare, Ides of Gemini), drummer Sasha Popovic, and guitarists Bryan Tulao and Ian Barry.

The band formed in 2007 in Los Angeles, United States. They released a demo the same year, and were signed to Brooklyn label Tee Pee Records in January of 2009. The following April, just after playing at the South by Southwest festival, Tee Pee released their debut album Wyllt. The album was produced and engineered by Scott Reeder, one-time bassist for stoner rock pioneers Kyuss. 

They disbanded in 2013, shorty after recording their last song; a cover of Nirvana's All Apologies. The song featured on In Utero, In Tribute, In Entirety , a tribute album to Nirvana's album In Utero, in 2014.
