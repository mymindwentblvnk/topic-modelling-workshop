Copremesis is a comic brutal death metal band from New York City, USA. They formed in 2001. Their music is a form of squelling vocals, crushing guitars and blasting drums to comic lyrics about cartoons, anime movies and other fun loving topics.

The band released their debut album after seven long years which contained two solid demos, a remarkable split with Pustulated (US) and a five way split tape in 2005 on Human Circus Records with Pulmonary Fibrosis, Cakewet, Vomitrocity and Flesh Disgorged. This brought them to their debut album "Muay Thai Ladyboys" released in May, 2008 by Paragon Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Copremesis">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
