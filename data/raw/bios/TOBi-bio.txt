Born in Nigeria, 26 year old TOBi immigrated to Canada with his father at 8 years old. This initial culture shock made TOBi aware intimately of his physical presence and how he was perceived by others. Struggling with this, he turned to music to express his thoughts and emotions. In 2016, he released his debut EP, FYi. On May 3rd, 2019 TOBi went on to release his debut studio album, STILL, which received high praises from media such as: i-D, BET, Billboard, Paper & L’Officiel. The album explored the multiple facets of masculinity and also the vulnerability he went through shortly after immigration. 2019 would prove to be an impactful year for TOBi, having his single “City Blues" premiered by Zane Lowe, performing to a sold out crowd in his hometown of Toronto the night he released his debut album, premiering “Beige” with a performance on COLORS, a freestyle on Sway In The Morning, as well as having his song “Ride” featured in HBO’s Ballers. TOBi is kicking off the new decade with a “City Blues” remix featuring The Game. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tobi">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
