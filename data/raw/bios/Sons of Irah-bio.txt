SONS OF IRAH was raised as soon as rockband Shades was laid to grave back in 2006. Their current lineup was established in 2007 and that's when they moved on as a five headed collective exploring new kinds of music and expanding their horizon. Hailing from the eastern regions of Belgium SOI brings forward an astonishing mix of aggressive, melodic, powerful, emotionally driven and low tuned metal music while drawing inspiration from both classic and modern day metal acts.

Through their music and lyrics the band tells the tragic story of Irah, a banished half-god who has to go on a quest for a relic known as The Black Lotus that can lift the curse that rests on the shoulders of his family.

In March 2009 SONS OF IRAH release their debut MCD and prove themselves to be a worthy addition to the metal scene of the 21st century. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sons+Of+Irah">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
