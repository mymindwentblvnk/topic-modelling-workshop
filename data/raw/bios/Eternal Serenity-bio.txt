(1994 - 1998)

Eternal Serenity started out in January 1994 as a symphonic doom metal band and was one of the first metal bands in the Netherlands using synths and piano. Featuring DaniÃ«l Castellano grunt / vocals, Patrick Duyst on guitar, Hans-Christiaan Gramberg on keys, Niels Bodewes on bass and Axel Vos drums. 

Their tape-demo "Wings of Tomorrow" released early 1996 got good reviews in Dutch media and according to Dutch magazine Aardschok "Eternal Serenity is on the right track and is a band of which we will certainly hear more in the future." 

They released the EP  "In One Spirit" in 1998. During the recordings there were already some disagreements, so unfortunately the band was split up shortly afterwards. 

In 2003 - 2008 the band tried to give Eternal Serenity a new try. But it didn't work out.   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Eternal+Serenity">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
