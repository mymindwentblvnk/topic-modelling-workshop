In 2007 a meeting of five experienced musicians took place. Their similar musical interests led to the launch of the band AnVision. The style and sound of the band is close to the progressive rock and progmetal genres, However, you can also find the influence of some other musical trends. Heavy rifts are mixed with gentle rhythms, dynamic strong songs as well as nostalgic ballads completed with pleasant melodic lines as well as intriguing lyrics. AnVisions ultimate goal is not commercial success, as the musicians say themselves "Composing the music we do not think about success or money, we do not follow any previous musical structures. Our music reflects our feelings and our emotions. That is the reason why making music brings us so much joy, and if we make just one of our fans happy then that is all that matters and that is our success!" <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Anvision">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
