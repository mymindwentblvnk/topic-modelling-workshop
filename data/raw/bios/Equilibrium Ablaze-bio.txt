Equilibrium Ablaze was started in the winter of 2007 deep in the backwoods of rural Connecticut. Like any new ambient black metal band, terrible demo tracks were recorded, but later dismissed due to their lack of coherency. So far, the band has not had a release, but a split with the band Maugrim, and will be released on CD at EEE Recordings and on tape at Tapes From The Woods.
