Dark Century is a band from Montreal that offers a style that is agressive, hilarious, heavy and bloody, but most of all, filled with trans fats and cholesterol. Incorporating influences from death, thrash, grind and harcore, the band tries to stay fresh while keeping a great taste of smoked bacon.

The first record, DAYS OF THE MOSH, came out in 2009 and already, the recession can be felt. Humanity trembles in front of the Mosh it created. Riots are everywhere and people are ripping each other for our merchandise. Beware of the skies! On a dark day, the Mosh and Dark Century are probably near, looking for fresh meat to consume!
