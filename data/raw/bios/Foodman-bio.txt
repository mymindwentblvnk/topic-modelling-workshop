Takahide Higuchi is a Japanese electronic producer, disc jockey and painter who works under the pseudonym Foodman. He has been releasing music since 2011 and is based in Yokohama. His work first gained traction in the early 2010s when he was recognised as a leading name in Japan's footwork and juke scene; the producer has continued to see his work as rooted in footwork. According to Resident Advisor, the musician's work blends different electronic genres, including juke and footwork but also ambient, techno, house and noise music, yet dissecting these styles and morphing them together "then driven to extreme without giving you a second to come up with a definitive genre." The Vinyl Factory consider him to be an experimental musician. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Foodman">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
