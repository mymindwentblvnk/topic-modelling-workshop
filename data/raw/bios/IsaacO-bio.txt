Isaac was born in 1994 in nigeria. He moved over to england with his family when he was 11. He is now a student at University of Birmingham. He bought and started playing the guitar in his first year of university due to the influence of his flatmates. Playing the guitar helped him to finally put down all the song ideas he always had into real recordable sound. 
He continued writing songs and playing in private for 2 years until december 2014 when he uploaded a cover of George Ezra's budapest. It went down a storm and he hasn't looked back since. He  won the UOB's got talent with a rendition of the frays 'how to save a life' which further improved his reputation. He has now started to release his secret trove of original music. He is hoping to also find 'his sound' as time goes on. 
He hopes this last few months of increasing popularity continues to rise :)  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/IsaacO">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
