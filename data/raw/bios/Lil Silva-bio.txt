19-year-old Lil Silva is fast becoming one of the most talked about artists on the UK Funky scene. Not only does he possess the musical understanding to work with genres such as American House, Funky and Grime but his ability also allows him to merge and blend styles. Silva’s flair manifests itself in his creative production techniques, showcasing a distinct sound which he looks to continually evolve. Always looking to shy away from convention, the young producer’s talents are becoming as renowned for their innovation as they are for the effect they are having on the scene. Prominent cultural magazine factmag.com has even gone as far as describing Lil Silva’s sound as 'grime in disguise.'

Having gained initial exposure via Marcus Nasty, pioneer of the UK funky house scene, Lil Silva's track Different featured on the Ministry of Sound's 2009 compilation, 'The Sound of UK Funky.'

In recent months his fresh sound has been put to use on a much needed remix of Sidney Samson’s No. 1 hit Riverside, which received significant airplay from the likes of Annie Mac and Mista Jam.

As well as working on a track with Ms Dynamite, 2010 will also see the release of Lil Silva’s debut E.P. which goes by the working title of 'Horrible'.
"I want producers and artists within the scene to help set a standard, especially when it comes to production - I’d like to see people experimenting with different sounds, instruments and programs. This way the music would appeal to a wider audience."

And with tunes such as Funky Flex and Seasons pushing his individual sound, Lil Silva may be moving out of Bedford sooner than he thinks.
