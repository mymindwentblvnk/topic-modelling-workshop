2. Heavy trash-, mixed with industrial metal, techno and a little bit of insanity makes Kakihara from Heerhugowaard, The Netherlands to something unique. Because every member of the band has his own musical taste, these genre's are being mixed to one big metal-cocktail. Some influences are: Strapping Young Lad, Fear Factory, Mnemic, The Dillinger Escape Plan, Chimaira, Frank Zappa or System of a Down. After a few performances the message was quite clear: When Kakihara plays, tigh your shoelaces and pull up your pants, because standing still is almost impossible. Add to this, throwing bananas or spraying with a giant cocksoaker. The band, formed in december 2004, added Jochem on the synth in november 2005, who now left the band to go backpacking in Australia. This addition wasn't such of a bad choice. After this, they got asked to play Molfest Metal 2006 with Demia (former Cancelled), Laberinto and Blind Sight. Shortly after they rocked the stage of the Waerdse Tempel! Kakihara recently brought out their first demo, called ‘From the Ashes’.

Ad van der Ploeg (vocals)
Paul Bloemendaal (guitar and vocals)
Jeroen Smit (guitar)
Reza de Graaf (bass)
Stefan Broersma (drum)
Jochem van den Bos (synth)
