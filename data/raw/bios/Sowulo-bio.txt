Sowulo makes atmospheric dark folk, strongly rooted in our pagan past.

With immersive songs Sowulo celebrates our great pagan legacy and takes an inner spiritual journey. The lyrics and the music, created with (early) medieval and contemporary instruments combined with cinematic sounds and voice, invoke archetypal wisdom and express the cyclical nature of existence.

Sowulo, Sowilu, Sowilo, or even better Sol or Sigel, is the name of the rune-s and means 'Sun' on a symbolic level. The cyclical nature of the Sun is the very central point of our lives and also of our music. Every musical component of Sowulo forms cycles: from every individual song up to the entire discography. They follow the movement of the Sun and tell the stories of our inner and outer cycles of day and night, the four seasons, life and death. 

Sowulo is a project formed by the Dutch multi-instrumentalist, composer and producer Faber Horbach. With a great passion for music, history and shamanism, Faber has a need for creating melancholic and meaningful songs full of spirit and depth and he has inspired thousands of listeners around the world to connect with their cyclical and spiritual nature through his music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sowulo">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
