Sethery was found in 1998 under the name Black Emotions. The first demo, "Grimland Sight", was recorded in february 2000. In 2000 band went through some guitarist changes and the synthplayer joined in. It was time to change the name to Sethery and record a new demo called "Retaliation". Unfortunately these early demos didn't get much attention. Next demo, "Bound in Hatred", was recorded in Tico-tico studios in March '02. Demo received very positive feedback and earned the trophy, 'Demosedän-merkki', on Finnish music magazine. This demo led Sethery to appear on Finnish dark/black-metal compilation, Jatkosota, published by Woodcut Records. After that Sethery decided to make one more demo which led to actual deal with Woodcut. In April 2003 Sethery entered Kolmosstudio to record their first album.
