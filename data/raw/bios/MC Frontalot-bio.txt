MC Frontalot is the stage name of Damian Hess, a hip hop musician and self-proclaimed "world's 579th-greatest rapper."  Many of his songs deal with things nerdy in nature, which has led him to be categorized as nerdcore, a word he himself coined in his first single, "Nerdcore Hip Hop".

He composed and recorded a song called 'The Penny Arcade Theme', and has appeared at the Penny Arcade Expos in the past few years. His track 'Final Boss' is featured in Penny Arcade Adventures: On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness - Episode One.
