Skinwhipper Christian Holm gathered forces in spring 2005 with Arild M. Torp , Sindre Solem from Obliteration and Glenn “ Biffen “ Iversen from Rabalder to create the most dirty and nasty thrash band Norway have seen in a long time.
The result can be heard on “ We’re Rotting”.
The band are sick and tired of all the fashion thrash metal bands that have emerged the last years and have a vision to show the good old thrash, with inspiration  from Destruction, Sadus and Kreator.

Nekromantheon from Kolbotn, Norway also have the honour to be the first band to be released on STØY Music, formerly known as Anthology Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nekromantheon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
