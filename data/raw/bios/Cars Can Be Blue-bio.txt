Cars Can Be Blue started during the summer of 2002 after the dissolution of Nate's cover band and Becky's improv comedy group. Left with enough free time to enter themselves into a local music festival, Nate and Becky used this impromptu performance as the catalyst for their first attempts at songwriting and were surprised by how well they ended up working together.

Cars Can Be Blue have shared stages with bands like Mates of State, The Lucksmiths, Jason Anderson/Wolf Colonel and xBxRx, stand-up comedians Eugene Mirman and Bobby Tisdale and even warmed crowds up for the hilarious Found Footage Film Festival. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cars+Can+Be+Blue">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
