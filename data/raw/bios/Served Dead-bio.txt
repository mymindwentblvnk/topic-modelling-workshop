Served Dead was founded early in the year 2008, in true and grim HÃ¤meenlinna, Finland. At first it was just Rontt and Trollkung playing grim metal under the influence of king alcohol. But through the year more members were recruited, Oldblood and Sarcasm for vocals and Quashnyrgh for bass. 

Served Dead musical influences come through the scene, not just some certain bands. Lyrical themes stem their roots from ancient myths and also from situations of the present day  and from the allout stupidity of humankind, too. Behind these gloomy stories are Oldblood and Sarcasm. Other servants are working with the music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Served+Dead">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
