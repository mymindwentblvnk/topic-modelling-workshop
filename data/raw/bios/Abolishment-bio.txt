ABOLISHMENT was founded in 2006 by drummer Ramon Cazares. Ramon was the guitarist and vocalist for Texas Death Metal band INFLICTION. After 2 releases, touring and performing along side with bands like Malevolent Creation, Incantation, Deeds of Flesh, Gorgasm and tons more, Ramon decided to call it quits and focus more on his personal life and family. After his departure from INFLICTION and 2 year hiatus, Ramon made the decision to step back into the scene with a new vision and project. And from the ashes of his former band rises a new fury that is ABOLISHMENT. In 2006, Ramon is joined by guitarist Carlos Melendez and enter the studio to record OBSCURE REMNANTS OF EVISCERATION. At the time Carlos was playing bass and Ramon recorded drums, guitars and vocal tracks. After searching and trying out numerous musicians, Carlos took over guitar duties and Ramon stayed on the drums. The song SUBHUMAN EXISTENCE was recorded with guest drummer Ben Garcia, who at the time was also playing for INFLICTION. The demo has been well received by death metal fans all over the world. In 2007, things get busy for ABOLISHMENT. Searching for musicians, working on music and setting forth plans for a full length release and performances. At this point, ABOLISHMENT recruits bassist Chuy Camacho (SEPTIC DEVOURMENT).The final pieces to the puzzle was complete when Pablo Gonzales and Eric Turley joined making the band a 5 piece. Pablo was the former vocalist for Infliction(rip) and Albuquerque's "Manias". Also, Eric Turley joins as our 2nd. guitarist and is currently apart of another project called "Eternal". In 2008, ABOLISHMENT plans to release their first full length titled, ABOLISHMENT OF FLESH. This release promises to have 11 tracks of pure brutality. A blend of melodic and technical death/black metal. This release will also include a cover of SECRET FACE written by the master musician CHUCK SCHULDINER of DEATH.
