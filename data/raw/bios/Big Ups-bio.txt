Big Ups are a punk rock band from New York City formed in September 2010. The band is comprised of drummer Brendan Finn, vocalist Joe Galarraga, guitarist Amar Lal, and bassist Carlos Salguero Jr. 

They played their first show on the roof of Joe's apartment building because no one would book them. Since then, they've been playing all over the city- in bars, basements, kitchens, and backyards. 

The songs are about love, alienation, indecisiveness, comics, and high fives; they're singable, but mosh pits are common and welcome. A Big Ups show is a performance, but it's never an act. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Big+Ups">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
