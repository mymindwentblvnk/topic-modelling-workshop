There are several artists named "Abiogensis":

1) Abiogensis is a band from Split, Croatia, formed in 2009. Abiogenesis plays a mix of heavy metal and hard rock, with comedy lyrics. Their biggest hit is "Romac B. Obama".

2) aka CJ Catalizer (aka Dmitriy Neschadim)
Hailing from Moscow, Dmitriy is known for his transcendental musical vision and devoted fan base…and with good reason: he’s been on the receiving end of glowing reviews in the international Psy Ambient scene since he first set out to create his unique brand of sonic psychedelia several years ago.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Abiogenesis">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
