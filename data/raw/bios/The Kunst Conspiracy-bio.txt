The Kunst Conspiracy is a Gothic thrash metal band from Chico, California.
Formed in 2002, by guitarists NiL and Maninal, TKC went through several keyboardists, bassists and drummers. They released the album "Machination" in 2006 with Mat Leathers on Bass, Patrick Harvey on Drums and Ezekiel Hughett on Keys.
They have since gone through even more line-up changes and are currently working on new material.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Kunst+Conspiracy">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
