Ablaze in Hatred is a Finnish melodic death doom metal band formed in 2004 by two friends, Juhani Sanna and Mika Ikonen, who had a desire to create music which was dark, slow but also very heavy and atmospheric.

In the autumn 2004 Ablaze in Hatred began to write music for the first promo-release. Early 2005 the song material was ready to be recorded in a studio.

In the spring 2005 drummer Antti Hakkala (Searing Meadow)and bassist Miska Lehtivuori (Fall of the Leafe) joined the band.

In august 2005 Ablaze In Hatred went to the studio to record their first promo-CD called "Closure of Life". The songs were recorded at the Noisecamp studios with producer Kari Nieminen. The result of that session was three songs over 20 minutes of slow and gloomy death/doom with growling vocals.

In September 2005 the promo "Closure of Life" was released. The release gained soon a very positive response in the scene.
In October 2005 the band signed a deal with Firebox Records and started to write/finish the material for the full-length album.
The debut album, titled as "Deceptive Awareness", was recorded in June 2006 and it will be released in early October 2006. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ablaze+in+Hatred">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
