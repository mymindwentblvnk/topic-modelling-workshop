OFFICIAL BAND BIOGRAPHY

Formed in June 2001 by Ozan (Vocals), Murat (Guitars) and Can (Drums) with the intention of playing melodic Black Metal with a particularly evil streak, EPISODE 13 has grown to become one of the leading extreme metal bands in Turkey, and is rapidly gaining a large following throughout Europe and the USA, with the music media starting to take note.  They perform live regularly, and have participated in several festivals and tours, including Norway’s Inferno Festival on 2009, which gained them a lot of respect from the audience, including the incredibly difficult to please Norwegian locals, and press alike, with much of the press calling them the surprise find of the festival.  EPISODE 13 has supported bands like SLAYER, MARDUK, VADER, ROTTING CHRIST, MOONSPELL, AMON AMARTH, ARCH ENEMY and AGATHODAIMON.    

One of EPISODE 13’s most popular tracks “Forlorn… Till Dawn” has proved hugely successful with radio stations, and has appeared on several compilations.  In February of 2006 a video version was released via the Internet following its premier on Dream TV.  

Following the temporary departure of founder member Ozan so that he could complete his studies, and original bassist Meric, the band recruited former WITCHTRAP vocalist Tolgahan to perform vocals on the “Pitch Black” album, whilst bass duties were taken over by Sermet.  It is this formation that recorded the last album “Pitch Black”.  

Before the album was released, Ozan Akyol was re-united with the band, and former ASTRAL DIVISION guitarist Serkan Zengin was recruited into the ranks completing the definitive EPISODE 13 line up.  The new album, titled “Death Reclaims The Earth” is currently being mastered.
