Aire Como Plomo is an experimental rock band from Bogotá (Colombia), that uses genre fusion as means for creating distinct song styles and odd structures, while keeping them geared towards hard hitting and energetic tunes. The band was formed in late 2006 and consists of José Jiménez (vocals), Juan Gaona (drums), Juan Franco (bass) and Miguel Jiménez (guitars). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/AIRE+COMO+PLOMO">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
