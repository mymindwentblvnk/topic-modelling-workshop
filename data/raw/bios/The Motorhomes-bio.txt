The Motorhomes, a 5-piece rock band out of Jönköping, Sweden, released two albums. The first, "Songs for me (and my baby)", released in 1999, yielded the hit "Into the night", which received substantial radio and video airplay in the Nordic region. Their follow-up was the 2002 album, "The long distance runner", which scored a minor hit in "The man", but failed to drum up the same attention as their debut. With this, the members of the band decided to call it quits, and the Motorhomes split up. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Motorhomes">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
