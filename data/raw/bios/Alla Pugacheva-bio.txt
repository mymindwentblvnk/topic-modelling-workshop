Alla Pugacheva (Алла Пугачёва) is arguably the best known musical performer in Russia, with record sales estimated at anywhere from 70 to 300 million records since her career began in the mid-1960s.  Her earlier compositions feature incredibly artistic melodies with sophisticated arrangements, witty lyrics, and almost theatrical vocals. By the 1990s, however, Pugacheva's records have become more standard for Russian estrada pop.  She also gained detractors thanks to the extensive support given to her by government media and continual gossip about her private life in tabloids.  Yet her earlier performances remain well-regarded, even by many younger, non-conformist musicians.

In 1997 she represented Russia in the Eurovision Song Contest with the song "Primadonna" with a very disappointing result. She couldn't reach the TOP 10. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Alla+Pugacheva">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
