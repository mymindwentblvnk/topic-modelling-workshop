Starting with the fall of '03. Original lineup consisted of Chris Sherrod on vocals, Blake Hall on Guitar, Mike Troutman on bass and Justin Ringle on drums. Calling themselves 5 Knuckle Imprint. Writing only a handful of songs, and after a few disputes in spring '04 the band decided to part ways with Blake. Then after getting a guy named Doug to fill the guitar spot. They tryed to add a second guitarist to the mix. With no success. Still only having only a handful of songs. In that summer the band met from a friend Pete Yeauger. They found that he was a very talented guitarist, dedicated and a good friend. They asked him to join. Then in that winter parted ways with Doug after some problems. The band consisted of Pete, Chris, Mike and Justin. Playing a few shows and having around 7 songs. While still searching for a second guitarist, with no luck. Because of lack of dedication, Drug abuse or difference in style. H.I. would remain a quartet for over a year. In August of '05 because of several problems they dealt with Troutman; The band moved on without him. Getting long time friend and bassist Jordan Chasteen. The band was taking a new direction and writing more and more songs. Playing more shows. Summer of 06 H.I. was added to a indie label Dissected Angel records. And late '06 early '07 they asked owner and manager of D.A. records (Dan Caetta) to join as a second guitarist. After learning their whole set in about 1 month, he has made a great asset to H.I. The band now consists of Pete, Chris, Justin, Dan and Jordan. And has done more now then in the whole 3 years of the bands history.
