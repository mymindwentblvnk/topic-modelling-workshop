Low Leaf is a Los Angeles based multi-instrumentalist, vocalist, composer and producer. Through years of DIY recordings, she has defined her own unique sound by combining the classical piano training of her childhood with her own self-taught harp, guitar, and production skills, plus heartfelt singing - giving way to a very pure, unrestricted and constantly growing signature style. She ultimately seeks to be a voice of both nature and her Filipino ancestors alike, in hopes to heal and re-awaken the world as a universal family. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Low+Leaf">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
