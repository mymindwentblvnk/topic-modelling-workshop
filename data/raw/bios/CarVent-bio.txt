In late 2006 George Gorbatov (guitar) and Ivan Bantsekin (bass-guitar) decided to unite and form a band. The repertoire was at first based on covers, but, eventually, they started writing their own songs. 
CarVent was founded in the year 2008 in Moscow, Russia, when Ivan Kovalev (vocals, guitar) joined the band, which had changed lots of names and members by that time. The first show took place on 22th of February and this date is a birthday of CarVent. 
It took two years to prepare all the materials for the album and, finally, on December 5th the first demo album 'Beyond the Tortures' was released. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/CarVent">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
