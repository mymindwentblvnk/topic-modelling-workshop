1) Staten Island's four-man crew Ice Water is led by Polite, a rapper who probably would have been a member of the Wu-Tang Clan if it wasn't for the fact that he was incarcerated as the Wu were first being signed to a label. A longtime friend of Wu member Raekwon, Polite would later turn up in the American Cream Team and the Ghostface-associated crew Theodore Unit. In 2000 he formed Ice Water with Stomach, P.C. (Paulie Caskets), and D.C. (Donnie Cash) and premiered the group by guesting on Raekwon's 2003 release The Lex Diamond Story. The full-length debut Polluted Water landed in 2007 on the Babygrande label.
