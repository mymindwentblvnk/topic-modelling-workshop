Wereworld is a symphonic metal band from Madrid founded in 1999 by Guillermo Riesgo under the initial name of Epsylon. With this name, in 2002, we produced a homemade demo and in 2004 we had our first concert at the "Asociación de Músicos de Móstoles". After several stops and changes, the band was reformed in 2010 with Ana Rochas on vocals, Guillermo Riesgo on guitars, Jaime Sarabande on keys and Ru Corleone on drums under the final name "Wereworld". The meticulous care at the composition and arrangements of the songs is the finger print of this band that aims to provide a future metal anthem of each theme they produce. Based on the strength of the melodies and feelings, Wereworld avoids any stylistic label and opens its arms in a wide range of sonic possibilities, suitable for all audiences. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/WereWorld">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
