Massive Destruktion(originally the name was Massive Distortion) was formed by Rob(drums) and CJ(guitar) back in 2005 as a Heavy/Thrash Metal project. The two of them gave a basic structure to what they wanted for the band but due to personal problems CJ couldn't continue with the project leaving Rob alone. In 2007 Rob revived Massive Distortion changing the name to Massive Destruktion with Abraham(who briefly did vocals back in 2005), PJ who was working with them on another project earlier and Carlos as the new guitar players. They started working on new material, leaving behind what Massive Distortion was for a more aggressive approach. Later they met Luis who played bass for their live shows for a while, then D'rek filled the bassist position but due to some personal difficulties he was unable to continue with Massive Destruktion, and now Angel joined the band as a full time bassist.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Massive+Destruction">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
