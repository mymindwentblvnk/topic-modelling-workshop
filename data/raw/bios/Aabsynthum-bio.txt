Lovin Catalin and Groza Gabriel started  as an Experimental Black Metal band in June 2004 under the name Adrasteia. In August 2006 the band changed their vision upon music and also changed the style approached, thus becoming Funeral Doom metal/Death Metal.
Aabsynthum now plays Funeral Doom Metal with rhythm changes, cavernous grunts, slow tempo, powerful guitar distortions,crushing riffs, atmospheric elements and violins.
It is dense, dark, depressing, sinister, obscure, suffocating, overwhelming, even conceptual...
A demo containing 4 songs saw the light of day in 2007.
Since October 2007 the band appears under the name Aabsynthum. In November Spranceana Andrei joined the band on drums.
In October 2008 Andrei and Gabriel began to record new songs for the album Non Forms... Regressus Ad Originem which was released in February 2009.

After the two members, L. Catalin and S. Andrei left the band for personal reasons, G. Gabriel decided to continue alone, this time in its pure manner. 
In June 2011 the second album called Inanimus was released through Marche Funebre Productions.
