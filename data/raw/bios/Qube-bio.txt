For Polish band, please use tag QUBE.com.pl.

This Last.fm profile is shared by two different artists using the same name.
The description below refers to Polish band QUBE from the city of Lublin:
 
The band was formed in Lublin, Poland. Their music can be described as progressive metal, hardcore, hard rock with winding guitar solos. But they also confess being influenced by funk and jazz. Everything began in Gajos's garage back in around 2000... Anyway the current band lineup plays since 2005 as QUBE, and that used to be their formation year. The lineup goes like this:
 
Daniel Gielza (Perła) vocals
Paweł Gajewski (Gajos) drums
Piotr Torbicz (Toper) bass
Kamil Wiśniewski lead guitar
Tomek Otto guitar
 
In 2006 they recorded their first studio album, entitled Shapes. Recording took 3 weeks, resulting in 43 minutes of great material. Until now the band played many concerts around Poland.
