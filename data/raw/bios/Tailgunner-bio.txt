1) - TailGunner is a 5-piece outfit coming out of Montreal, Canada. Our songs are about personal experience. Our aim is to play what we want to play with no compromises. After 40+ hours of work a week everyone needs to blow off a little steam, everyone needs an outlet of expression... This is ours. If you can identify with our songs, then great, come along for the ride. If you can’t, then there are plenty of other bands on the radio that you can listen to. We play Punk rock the way it’s meant to be... as life as we see it. Cheers – TailGunner - 

TailGunner is:
Vocals – Steve L.
Guitar - Felix Thezencat
Bass – Danny Duke
Drums – Custom Pat

 Nothing speaks more truly of the bands mission then that of the motto of the city in which we live: "Concordia Salus", Salvation through Harmony... Having grown up in the same city, sharing many of the same experiences, the boys of TailGunner find redemption and draw our inspiration from a desire to play the music that remains the soundtrack of our lives... pure unabated Street Rock & Roll!
