Behind the extraordinary name Xylonite IvY there is a young female singer, songwriter and keyboarder, too. In the run-up to the recordings for her first album Frailty Of Power a 4Track-EP was produced. During these recordings in 2004 the current line-up of her band turned out. The music of Xylonite IvY breaks a new ground in the range of Gothic-Rock or Gothic-Metal. With the EP the band already received well reviews in press. Awaiting an album it was spoken about the unusual influences of Progressive-Rock or Space-Rock. Before the recordings for the album the band played a show at the Wave Gotik Treffen in 2005. In October of the same year the album Frailty Of Power was released. With their songs the band continues the combination of outstanding elements with Gothic-Rock or Gothic-Metal. The distinctive, direct and soulful vocal performance evolves into fancy, sometimes melancholy, but then catchy lines. Groundbreaking melodies dominate the dynamical instrumental accompaniment without compromises. Hammering guitar-riffs alternate with playful solo parts. Influences of Art-Rock of the seventies are in evidence, too. To draw comparisons with other Gothic-Metal-Bands is unnecessary, `cause there aren`t any. (www.necroweb.de) With their debut-album the band presents a remarkable and professional compilation of songs, you hardly find on a newcomer-album. 'Frailty Of Power is of such an extent musicality and intensity that you will sort the sound of Xylonite Ivy into the file progressive, even though that`s not absolutely right because the quartette reveals facets with their own character.'
