In early 2006 she joined Jeffrey (Guitar) giving a more robust sound and organized the band, and a month later would Jason (Vocals) suggesting a more brutal and aggressive voices. Work began doing Death Metal for a few months but decided to incorporate elements of Grind to give a stronger sound and violent band today that is what is represented, with the theme of human decadence aberration.
