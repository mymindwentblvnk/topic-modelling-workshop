Raime is the London-based duo of Joe Andrews and Tom Halstead releasing music on the Blackest Ever Black label. Traversing somewhat similar territory to Demdike Stare's occult ambient dub, they debuted in 2010 with the Raime EP, a three-tracker that split the difference between minimalist techno, chamber ambient and the 4AD and Factory labels ca. 1982. Industrial, techno, dubstep: various words were thrown at them and their music, but none seemed adequate, and none has really stuck. 

Their 2012 debut album "Quarter Turns Over A Living Line" was followed by the 2016 album "Tooth", which saw the duo using guitar in a move away from dark ambient and industrial techno.
