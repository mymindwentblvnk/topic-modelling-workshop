10: A collection of fuck ups and weirdos from New Haven County.
"Detox is not a straight edge band or even a drug-free band. Some of us like to get high, and some of us don't. Some of us are high right now but don't want to be. This record, like many before it, is about screaming at the top of your lungs for change."
