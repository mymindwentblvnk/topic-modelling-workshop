Gorjeo Seglar is a compound concept; whose words mean: Gorjeo-hymns and Seglar-global; that is to say, the hymns of the world; the hymns of perception (how they perceive the world to be precise); in that case, those are the pagan hymns and anthems. In the lyrics of the band, they tackle independent stories whose thread topic is life, death, hate, the earth, the sea, mountains, woods, desolated deserts and extinguished or forgotten people in which everything spins around an unique axis in a cyclic and renovated way.

The idea of the lyrics is to comprise the above mentioned and the legends from forgotten people from their country (Chile), forgotten even by themselves and the people who live there; in other words, they want to rescue the roots from this extremely southern and far piece of land, Chile, and take all this into metal music. They mostly referred to the Gaia Theory: nature as a vivid being, and humans as creating beings, consequence of the consequences; this idea they try to preserve as a band. They have a strong connection with it and they think of it more as a transcendental matter which breaks the features of the so-called Redeemer, than any other cultural matter and all the absurd principles the demiurge imposes. This represents a direct confrontation with Christianity promoting thoughts as a tool to question society.
