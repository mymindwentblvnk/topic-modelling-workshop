Biography

Cobblestone Jazz have been performing live electronic music for four years on the west coast of British Columbia. The three members of the group are programmer Tyger Dhula, keyboardists Danuel Tate and Mathew Jonson, whose recent works for Itiswhatitis, Minus and Substatic have brought him international recognition. The nature of their music balances electronic composition with a live and moving element that results in the exploration of many different styles.

Cobblestone are a bit of an anomaly in this day and age of studio refinement, opting to approach music from a performance perspective first, as opposed to recreating studio pieces for their live shows. A large part of this is due to the involvement of Tate, whose background as a jazz musician has led to a large emphasis on playing live. The group's influences range from jazz and dub to breakbeats and minimal techno, and many points in between, and any of these styles can surface at a given time in their music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cobblestone+Jazz">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
