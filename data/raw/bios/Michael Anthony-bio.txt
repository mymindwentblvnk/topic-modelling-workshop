The best songs on albums aren't singles. They are track 12, the one with the killer breakdown that sneaks up on you while you are turning house into home: washing, folding, and cleaning cobwebs from corners. The best musical experiences can be found on late night car rides, the experiences you don't curate by sifting through songs, the experiences that find you when you allow the music player to take the lead. The most honest music speaks to the condition of the human soul and links lyrics to reality.

This is the characterization of Michael Anthony's body of work. His songs represent transparency and openness dipped in funk. Layers of soft velvety vocals emerge from jazz harmonies and social commentary sourced from samples. His creations are the musical representations of the Blank Panther tapes. His art is activism embodied.

In an era of instant gratification, it's easy to understand why the tastes of Michael Anthony are misunderstood. His sound, and his influence within the Chicago-based musical collective THEMpeople, is cut from the same cloth as musing musical legends. Even with ties to the Windy City, influence from his hometown of St. Louis, MO remains prevelent. His music provides the type of sound that gives you an initial easy buzz, the kind of warmth offered by the smoolest liqueur, only to leave you punch drunk from the authenticity and vulnerability offered.

Michael Anthony moves with purpose and creates the cinematic soundtrack of the newest black renaissance. While everyone is amazed by the mainstream use of funk and soul, Michael Anthony has curated images and sounds that have these elements for years. It's hard being ahead of your time, a time traveler of sorts.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Anthony">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
