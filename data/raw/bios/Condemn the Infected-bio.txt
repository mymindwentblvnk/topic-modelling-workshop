ABOUT
CONDEMN THE INFECTED is a death metal band based in College Park, MD. The band formed in 2007 when vocalist/bassist Jeremy Harmon, guitarists Ravi Robinson and Tim Mullaney and drummer Henry Everitt from death metal acts ARIOCH and CHAPTER OF DECAY decided to experiment with the more technical side of extreme music. Later that year, the band had written some material and began to play shows in the Baltimore and DC areas, and in early 2008 the first 3 song, untitled demo was recorded at Wired Wrists studios in Baltimore. The following year lead to a series of line up changes, including the departure of their guitarist, Tim, and the addition of bassist Brady Krebs. In the months following, the band joined up with guitarist Gunter Ostendorp of Knossis, and continued writing for their debut album. This venture was short lived, as the band soon parted ways with Gunter and ended up with Chris Keller of MORTRID and PUTREFACTION. By the end of 2009, CONDEMN THE INFECTED's 8 song debut had been written and recording began with Darin Morris (MISERY INDEX, CRIMINAL ELEMENT). After a myriad of delays and complications, recording was put on hold and in early 2011 the band was headed to Mexico for their first tour with Mexican grinders ROTTENNESS. Following their return, the band parted ways with bassist Brady, and Jeremy assumed bass duties in addition to vocals. Recording resumed as well as an increase in the frequency of live performances. The following 2 years resulted in the departure of longtime guitarist Ravi, the subsequent replacment by Jeff Parcher, and in early 2013, the band returned to Mexico to tour with REXUS (MX) and MASS MURDER MESSIAH (US). Currently CONDEMN THE INFECTED is finishing up their first full length record DENY EXISTENCE at UMBC studios and the record is slated for DIY release later this year. With a powerful array of brutal riffs, haunting melodies, blazing guitar solos, earth- shattering drumming, odd time signatures, dizzying bass and commanding vocals, DENY EXISTENCE is sure to shred the minds of any fan of SUFFOCATION, CYNIC, GORGUTS, DEATH, MORBID ANGEL, MESHUGGAH, DECAPITATED and more. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Condemn+the+Infected">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
