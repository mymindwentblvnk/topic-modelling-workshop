Deathwitch were a Black/Thrash metal band from Gothenburg, Sweden. Deathwitch was the side-project of Nicklas Rudolfsson (Terror) - probably most known for his work in Runemagick - together with some girls (witches) that later became Dracena. They split up after Nicklas Rudolfsson left the band in 2005 for unknown reasons. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Deathwitch">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
