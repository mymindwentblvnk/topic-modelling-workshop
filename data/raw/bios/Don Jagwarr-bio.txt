Don Jagwarr (born as Duane Kevin Earle in Trindad) is a rapper from the '90s who combined hardcore rap & raggamuffin music along with West Coast G-funk grooves into a style he called “ragga-funk.”

In 1990, as "Earle the Poet", he released an album called “For Your Listening Pleasure”, which was released promotionally on cassette.

In 1992, Don made an uncredited appearance on Ice Cube’s single “Wicked” and was subsequently signed to the Street Knowledge/Priority record label. He also wrote the tracks “Switchez” and “It’s On” for Eazy-E.

In 1994, he released the album “Faded”, which did not chart.

He is now the owner of a restaurant called Earle’s (formerly known as Earlez Grille‏) in Los Angeles, California.
