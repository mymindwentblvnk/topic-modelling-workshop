Beneath Hades was formed towards the end of 2006 as a six piece thrash/death metal outfit.

We are the result of the union of two local Leyland bands â€“ Hara Kiri and Call To Arms, Both of whom had gigged throughout the North West for some time.

The reasons behind the two bands coming together were the departure of some original members and the desire of the remaining members to continue to create original and innovative music.

As a result we now play a brand of music which incorporates many different influences, such as: death metal, black metal, thrash and hardcore.

After the band was formed we took some time out from gigging to focus on writing new material and re-working older songs. This intense period of writing and rehearsing has enabled the band to gel together both musically and personally.

The band consists of vocalist Stephen Hogan, Paul Hindle and Matt Johnston on Guitars, with Matt providing back up vocals for the singing harmonies, Chris Hindle on bass and finally James Leckey on drums.

We have played throughout the North West and beyond. Anywhere you want us to play, let us know and we'll come down and give it death!

There's not enough room on this page to thank every band we've played with, hung out with and got crunk with. So here's a little thank you for every last one of you sexy bitches, it wouldn't be as fun without you! x

We are building a loyal and vocal fan base throughout the North West, the UK and the World.

We want to conquer this planet and we can only do it with your help. XD
