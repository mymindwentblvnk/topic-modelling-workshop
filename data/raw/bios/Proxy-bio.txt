3: An Edinburgh-based three-piece pop-punk band, gigging regularly since 2004.  The band released a 4 track EP (Tigershaped) in 2005 and are recording a full length album to be released in 2009.

4: A four-piece band: Some bands get lucky. Others - the ones that tend to matter - get busy. "In music, there's so much luck involved but we've always maintained the mentality that there is no way we cannot get signed, otherwise I'll kill myself or something," says Proxy frontman Jon Brown. "There was no way, after years playing together, we were going to hit twenty-four, get a job and settle down."

Strong words possibly, but its such determination that brings Proxy's music to your ears. Theirs is a tale of talent and determination whose seeds were planted in stuffy pre-teens classrooms. Though Proxy are English and London-based, the four members of Proxy were born and raised in three different continents - half-Chinese frontman Jon Brown in Hong Kong, Will Hanson in Paris and the Grindy brothers who form the unwavering rhythm section in South Africa.

It's possibly these returning alien beginnings that have made Proxy a singular entity. "We always wanted to create our own little world to inhabit, as much as create a band." says Will. "We've never aligned ourselves with any regional music scene, but we're just not one of those bands. We exist in own self-create isolation and like it that way."

Given that guitarists Jon and Will have been playing together since the age of ten, Proxy's recent singing to A Records/Island has been a long time coming. While early shared influences included Queens Of The Stone Age, Lift To Experience, ...Trail Of Dead and Jeff Buckley, the early years of the band were defined by a relatively blas� attitude to what being in a band meant. At that stage this meant sporadic gigs when at school or, later, when the members were back home from college commitments - and little more. "This band is a long-distance girlfriend," says Jon. "It's something we kept returning to, wherever we were or what we were doing."

When all four members of Proxy found themselves back in London two years ago and inspired by seeing live bands such as The Mars Volta or Mogwai, they unearthed a new-found dogged determination and decided to get serious. "We said we'd give it a year, a full-on assault," says Jon. "It's a complete myth that if you're merely out gigging around London or have a strong MySpace profile you'll get snapped up. You have to go the extra distance."
