A producer, singer, and songwriter based in Berlin, Germany, Antonia Rug makes expansive, otherworldly indie electronica as Novaa. With a fractured, whimsical mix of organic and manufactured sounds, she emerged in 2016 on a series of collaborations with like-minded producer Moglii as well as with her debut LP, Stolen Peaches.

Novaa began making music in her teens, experimenting on guitar and piano until she discovered Ableton. Riveted by its possibilities, she began learning the tool and composing songs for an album she intended to call Peaches. After her laptop was stolen, Novaa started over, using fragments of songs and ideas from the lost recordings. In the meantime, she made a collaborative EP with explorative DÃ¼sseldorf-based producer/singer Moglii (Simon Ebener-Holscher) called Down Under. It was released by Pennywine Records in mid-2016. Her solo debut, Stolen Peaches, arrived that October on the same label. She finished out the year with the stand-alone single "Weak Heart," a collaboration with Fishbowl Forbes for Beatdek Records.

Novaa was featured on Moglii's track "Tonic Water" in April of 2017, and later that year she issued an ethereal remix of the MADANII song "Wvtchmen" as well as collaborations with Alex Lustig and LO. The electronic-orchestral solo track "Club Paradise" followed on Novalty in mid-2018. ~ Marcy Donelson <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Novaa">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
