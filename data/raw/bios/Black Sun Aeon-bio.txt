BLACK SUN AEON was born in the beginning of 2008 to reflect the darker personal side of the founder and sole member Tuomas Saukkonen (Before The Dawn, Dawn Of Solace, The Final Harvest).

Even after 2 written and produced album in 2008 (Before the Dawn's Soundscape of Silence and The Final Harvest's The End) there was something stirring beneath the surface and from that abyss rose the Black Sun Aeon debut album DARKNESS WALKS BESIDE ME.

Beside the solo nature of the band a session live line-up is already gathered amongst the few and honoured that are giving their voice to the album as guest vocalists: Tomi Koivusaari (Amorphis), Ville Sorvali (Moonsorrow), Mynni Luukkainen (Sotajumala) and Mikko Heikkil√§ (Sinamore). 

In January 2013, Tuomas Saukkonen put all of his ongoing bands and projects to rest, including Black Sun Aeon, and announced the beginning of Wolfheart.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Black+Sun+Aeon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
