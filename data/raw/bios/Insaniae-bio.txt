It was the final hour of 2003 that saw Insaniae come to life. Coming from various other bands of the Portuguese metal scene, the five members that are Insaniae knew the time was right for slowing things down and letting the misery spill out.

Recording the music we want to hear and playing live to likeminded individuals is the key to our survival, it is our goal. Amongst a few other influences, we’re normally referred to as a Doom act …so be it.

In December 2005, was recorded Outros Temem os que Esperam pelo Medo da Eternidade which was well received in certain dark corners of the land.

In January 2009 Insaniae joined the celebration of Daemonivm 3rd anniversary alongside with Mourning Lenore, participating in a four song Split CD.

In June 2010 the second album Imperfeições da Mão Humana is released by ARX Prod.
In November of that year the drummer Marcio Guerreiro leaves the band and is replaced by the actual drummer Pedro Faria.
 
In May 2011 the first album was re-released By ARX Prod. with new cover art and a new bonus track with the new drummer
