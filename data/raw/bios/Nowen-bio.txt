Nowen was founded in 1999 in Raahe by Mikko Lappalainen. Due to lack of decent band members he was forced to move to Lahti. Between 2001 and 2003 Nowen released 2 demos entitled "From Birth to Death" and "Cursed or Blessed" and played a few gigs. In couple of years Mikko Lappalainen got bored with wimps and unmotivated members in the band and decided to get rid of them. Soon after that in 2005 he asked his friends Jarno Nurmi and Markus Taipale to join the band and finally Nowen became a stable unit with attitude and ability to handle even the most complicated musical material. In 2005 Nowen also released their latest attempt to destroy the planet, "Where Hell Begins" MCD. On WHB Nowen took turn for more aggressive and twisted way of expression. "Where Hell Begins" was highly acclaimed and soon sold out. Now, after 2 years of bad drinking habits, mental problems and numerous insane gigs Nowen has started rehearsing for their first full-length album which will be recorded during the year 2009 <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nowen">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
