Lowfellow was founded early in 2005 by guitarists Peter Karpati and Illes Zugn, supported by Sunscreen's drummer Roland Zistler. Shortly afterwards two other men joined the group: Aaron Tamasi on bass and Szilard Vanyi on vocals.
Lowfellow was mostly influenced by stonerrock and doom metal and everything that was played by the Gods of the 70's. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lowfellow">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
