Pete was born in South Korea, but raised in Queens. A product of New York City - and a graduate of Cooper Union - Calm Pete rhymes in numerous styles about the world and culture of this varied town, his personal struggles, and is never afraid to drop a few stories. His style is far from straight-forward - there are plenty of inside jokes the normal fan has no hope of ever catching. This gives his writing a very personal touch, but it's all balanced out with lush images, great couplets, and jokes galore. A very humbled and quite strong comparative new artist in the game. Cool Calm Pete basically inspires listeners with a fresh sound, original beats, which are mostly sampled from old Korean soul records, and a viewpoint that, let's face it, doesn't get much rep.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cool+Calm+Pete">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
