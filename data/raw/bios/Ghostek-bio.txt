Ghostek's sound is a ghostly twist on underground music. Full of field recording and found sounds, his music is immersive, really allowing you to fade out and slip into the sounds.

He has a few strong collaborations with such artists as Roof Light (Ghostlight), VVV, Sorrow, Sleepyhead, SQZ ME to name a few.
