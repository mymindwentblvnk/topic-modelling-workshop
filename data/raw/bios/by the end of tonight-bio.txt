Hailing from Alvin, TX, By The End of Tonight was a four-piece post-rock instrumental band that encompasses driving bass lines, spastic drum beats and fluid fretboard action with math-rock and post-hardcore tendencies to deliver a instru-metal experience unlike anything you've heard.

Formed in 2003, the band was renowned for being a ferocious live act as well as a relentless touring  group, usually touring for months on end. 

They released their first album 'In a Letter to the Sandbox...' in 2003. The CD was self produced and only 1,000 copies were made. Shortly after, the band signed to Temporary Residence and released the 'Fireworks on Ice' EP, which consists of four remastered songs from 'In a Letter to the Sandbox...'. The group was the first band ever to be signed by Temporary Residence Limited based only on a demo.

In 2005, they released 'A Tribute to Tigers' which showed the band further developing their sound.

In 2006, one of the bands guitarists, Josh Smith, left the band to pursue individual commitments. He was replaced by a close friend of the band, Brett Taylor.

Later in the year, the band released a set of four EP's, one recorded by each band member, partially due to the fact that they couldn't record together due to distance.

In July 2007, the band's long-time drummer Jeff Wilson left the band. 

August 2007 saw the release of a 7" split with the band O Pioneers!!!

November 2007 saw the release of a split with the band Tera Melos, called 'Complex Full of Phantoms'.

The band announced their breakup in early 2009 after they could not find a replacement for drummer Jeff Wilson. 

The band is briefly reuniting in 2011 for one show on 3/5 at Fitzgerald's as well as a set at the Free Press Houston Summerfest 2011. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/By+the+End+of+Tonight">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
