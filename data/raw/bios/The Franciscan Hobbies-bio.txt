The Franciscan Hobbies are a psychedelic folk super group from San Francisco, CA, United States, featuring Glenn Donaldson, Loren Chasse, Allan Horrocks, Jason Honea, Bryan De Roo, Kerry McLaughlin, Rob Reger, Christine Boepple, and Greg Bianchi.
Part of the Jewelled Antler Collective, The Franciscan Hobbies have been known to put this into practice by taking their junk folk instruments, boomboxes and mini-discs outside, gathering in canyons, creek beds, backyards, and on porches and beaches.
