The Long Cold Dark is a four piece American heavy metal band from Buffalo, NY. Formed in 2008 Drew Celestino (guitar/vocals), Jason Oberg (guitar), Mitch Krieger (percussion), and Phil “Pusbert Headington III” Boyle (bass) released their debut self-titled album in 2010 which defines the TLCD sound. Barbarically heavy handed riffs over top of pulverizing drums are at the heart of that sound. Underneath that threatening exterior lies a soaring and droning melodic style that is always driven home by Celestino's forceful vocal style. Phil's commitments in his hometown of Cleveland, Ohio have brought new bassist Adam Malone into the fold. These guys are focused and fine tuned, and they back up their recorded sound with a high-energy live show. They walk the path and represent the "Queen City" of Buffalo in a way that only defiant blue collar native sons could.
