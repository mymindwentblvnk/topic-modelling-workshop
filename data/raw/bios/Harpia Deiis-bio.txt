HARPIA DEIIS was founded 2002 in Vienna and Korneuburg, early named Onass. The Band is always seeking a metal sound with clean, melodic parts. The band's trademark are the clean vocals of the female singer and the growls of the male one. The influences are multiple, and come from the Progressive, Melodic Death, Thrash and Symphonic Metal scene.

Recently the band has been working at new songs, which variety is remarkable, and a full-length Album is also in progress. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Harpia+Deiis">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
