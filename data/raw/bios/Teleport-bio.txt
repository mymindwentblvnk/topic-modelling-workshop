There are/were at least five bands called Teleport: 

1) A Finnish HC Dance group (formed by Januski) alive from 2002 to 2006, and a German one. 

2) German Teleport are Dr.Seb, Double G., Matt Scheuer und Chrisch Schneider. Their home base is in the famous Hansa Studios building in the center of Berlin at Potsdamer Place, formerly Europe’s largest building site, maybe it’s noises were inspiring for the tribal structures of the tracks…

3) A band from Montpelier, VT with four guys who are totally friends and make music. http://www.myspace.com/letsteleport

4) A progressive/technical thrash metal band from Ljubljana, Slovenia, formed in 2010. They realesed their first independent demo "Galactic Usurper" in 2011.  The current line-up is Lovro Babič in bass, Jan Medved in guitars and vocals, Toni Pleško in drums and Blaž Tanšekin guitars. They show influences from bands like Coroner, but mostly from Voivod, with sci-fi lyrics, raspy vocals and a progressive speed metal.
