California native Jonathan Rado began the '60s pop-borrowing indie duo Foxygen with his friend Sam France while the two were still teenagers. When Foxygen got around to releasing albums on a more worldwide level in the early 2010s, their acclaim and press profile grew exponentially. After a particularly draining Foxygen tour that spanned 2012 and 2013, Rado announced he would be releasing a solo album, though his main gig was not breaking up. Said album, Law and Order, was released on the Woodsist label in late 2013 and bore many of the same Brill Building, British Invasion, and late-'60s pop reference points as Rado's songs for Foxygen. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jonathan+Rado">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
