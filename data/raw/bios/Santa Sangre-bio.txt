Santa Sangre formed in the summer of 1999 from fragments of one of Syracuse, NY's renowned bands, Another Victim. Before their split, SS had begun to tailor a distinctive pattern through modern hardcore. Combining elements that made their individual debuts memorable, Santa Sangre approach a dynamic view of hardcore, while maintaining an edge that edge that appeals to a widespread audience of heavy music enthusiasts. The music casts brooding tones full of nightmarish imagery, alighted by rays of ingenuity. The stage presence of Santa Sangre is arresting and memorable. After many show-stealing performances, they achieved enthusiastic crowd response and recognition.

Santa Sangre split up in 2002 and members went on to form The Promise. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Santa+Sangre">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
