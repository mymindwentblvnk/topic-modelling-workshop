April 16th was a British traditional heavy metal band formed in 1982. They only released one album called "Sleepwalking" in 1988, making them too late to be a part of the NWOBHM scene. The band were forced to drop out of the frontline of the rock business for financial reasons in 1991. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/april+16th">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
