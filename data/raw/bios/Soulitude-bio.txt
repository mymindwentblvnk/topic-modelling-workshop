After so many years playing in the Metal band VALHALLA 
(www.valhalla-metal.com), Jevo decided to release an album by his own with new elements as guttural vocals and synths. 

There are currently two studio albums available by the band: The Crawlian Supremacy and Destroy All Humans, both of which are available for free download on Soulitude's official website.
