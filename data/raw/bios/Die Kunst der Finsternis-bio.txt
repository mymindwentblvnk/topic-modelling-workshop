Die Kunst der Finsternis was formed as a solo project of Herr Schattenriss to experiment a macabre vision of artistic boundaries with magic. The texts are strongly related with occult Vampirism and initiatic aspects. Music itself is a devotional letting go of precious energy and the calling for "The Bloodline".
