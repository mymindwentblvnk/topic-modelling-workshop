Shadow Warriors was the secret side ninja metal project/joke band of the more famous DragonForce. ZP Theart also sang in Shadow Warriors, a side project by his then DragonForce bandmate Sam Totman during the late 1990s. 
 The "drummer" listed on the band's site isn't a real person, it's actually a drum machine.  As of current the band has broken up. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Shadow+Warriors">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
