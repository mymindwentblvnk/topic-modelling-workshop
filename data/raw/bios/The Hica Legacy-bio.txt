Coremetal band from,

Connecticut, 
United States. 

The Hica Legacy
Formed in early 2005, The Hica Legacy, a five piece grindcore band from Connecticut. Having taken initiative from band members, Justin and Tyler, to form the band; it has steadily evolved into a chaotic and heavy form of what each person in the band considers to be sentimental, and that is, music. Connecticut offering scarce outlets for the band to exemplify their true passion, Hica continues to play shows consistently, because after all, the true heart behind this all cannot be spoken through words. Rather it is seen and heard through the relationship of rhythm and tone and backed up by a passion and drive for doing the things you love. It would be easy to analyze or become critical but the best outlet for understanding what is The Hica Legacy, is simply listening.
