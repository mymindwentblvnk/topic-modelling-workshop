There are 3 bands bearing the name Abhorrent
1) Norwegian old school death metal band
2) Brutal death metal band
3) Australian 3 piece Grindcore band. 

1) Norwegian Abhorrent was formed in 1989. They only released one demo tape before splitting up. The members of the band later formed Thyabhorrent

2) Resembling Deeds Of Flesh in both its wealth of riff-variations and athletic rhythmic assault, this music surges constantly forwards referencing itself only tangentially, as brief glimpses into parallel dimensions of organic possibility that pass by with a deathlike unstoppable certainty. The intensity is almost overwhelming and following the more intricate details of pieces as they unfurl requires attentive listening, but at the same time there is a simplicity of epic motion ingrained within this music at its meta-level. Abhorrent is like the amoral and violent force of nature, realizing itself through pure will and power both in spite of death and echoing it vitriolically all the way to its end.
