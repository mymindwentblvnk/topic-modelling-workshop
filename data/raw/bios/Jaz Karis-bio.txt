South Londoner and Brit school alumna Jaz Karis is a force to be reckoned with, with luscious vocals that travel between the soundscape of Soul, Jazz and Hip Hop. Her debut EP Into The Wilderness, released on all female-run independent label Salute The Sun Records, features collaborations with Sillkey, Blue Lab Beats, Mike Musiq, Tinyman and Zulu.

With influences ranging from Erykah Badu, Amy Winehouse, Alicia Keys & Miguel, Jaz explains: “It’s not about being inspired by their fame or recognition – I respect these artists who make music on their own terms & have their own authentic sound – I don’t want to just follow a trend and do what’s popular right now just for the sake of it.”

With this in mind, Into The Wilderness marks the start of a new chapter for Jaz Karis. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jaz+Karis">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
