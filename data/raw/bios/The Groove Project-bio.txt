Notable members and special guests of the band in the past (and present) have included current and former Dream Theater keyboardists Jordan Rudess and Derek Sherinian, GRAMMY Award winning saxophonist Jeff Coffin from the Dave Matthew Band, keyboardist Adam Holzman best known for his long association with Miles Davis, Weird “Al” Yankovic guitarist and GRAMMY Winner Jim Kimo West, GRAMMY Award nominated arranger Don Hart best known for his long association with Phish, Acclaimed Jazz pianist Fahir Atakoglu and keyboardist Ed Roth from Chad Smith’s Bombastic Meatballs.
