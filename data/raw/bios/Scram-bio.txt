2.
Scram!, who perform the tracks below (i.e. Piece of the Pie, Here Tonight, Power), was a band from Philadelphia, PA. who were together as a band from 1985-1992. They were a trio (Craig Heim - Drums, Matt Mungan - Guitar & Voice, Greg Mungan - Bass), who originated in Devon PA (err, i think!). They were mainly Thrash, Reggae, and Socio-Political. In 1988, they were joined by Oded Fried-Gaon, who played percussion, and Elliott Levin, who played Sax and Flute. While they remained hard-edged and energetic, this was a turn in musical direction toward Worldbeat, RnB, and Funk. 1989 brought on a fuller horn section, with Trombone, Trumpet, and Saxophone (I'm sure!). They were really good, and according to the Philadelphia Inquirer "one of the most promising bands to come from the City of Brotherly Love" (or something like that), but alas personal disagreements between bandmembers, and a continued lack of direction and management brought upon these talented individuals their demise. They're still nice people, some even still play music, but most are busy being boring bodies. who knows, someday they might reunite for an awfully bad unplugged session. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Scram">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
