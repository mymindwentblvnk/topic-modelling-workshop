Mary Bell is a feminist punk band from Paris, France. The band features frontwoman Alice Carlier, bassist Tristan Bardré, guitarist Victoria Arfi, and Gaïlla Montanier on drums. The band's self-titled debut LP was released in January, 2017.

Mary Bell may also refer to a sludge band from Utrecht, Holland. They started out in 2004 from the ashes of Sweet Willy Rollbar - most probably one of Holland's first sludge bands. Mary Bell sounds heavy, sludgy and noisy and are often considered a sludge/doom band.

The band's first full-length record titled 'Mary Bell' was recorded in summer 2005 and was released on the Spanish label Trabuc Records. This album was recorded as a five piece, with two vocalists. The end of 2006 saw the departure of the band's guitar player, resulting in some changes and the continuation of the band as a four piece with one vocalist.

Mary Bell have played live shows with MOHO, Ramesses, Unearthly Trance, Reverend Bizarre, Toner Low, Electrozombies, HSML, Monarch! plus many more. The band did a short Spanish tour in 2008. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mary+Bell">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
