1. A rap/hip hop/R&B artist from Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.

2. A Hard Rock/Heavy Metal Band from Dayton, Ohio, USA.
With three CDs and a global fanbase, ARCH RIVAL has certainly proven to be a prolific melodic hard rock act. Based out of Dayton, Ohio, the core band consisting of Michael Harris (guitar); Gary Rigmaiden (bass), and Greg Martin (drums), played the midwest club scene for several years before finding their niche in vocalist, Steve Snyder, and wasted no time recording their debut record at Midtown Studio in Nashville. Entitled "IN THE FACE OF DANGER", the CD proved AR's ability to write compelling rock music with melody, and immediately garnered airplay and major label attention to the group and they signed their first overseas deals.

The band toured in support of "ITFOD", while working up new material for their follow up, "WAKE UP YOUR MIND". Travelling to the New York area for these recording sessions, the band discovered new sounds and styles on their critically acclaimed 2nd album. This highly impressive recording again landed them solid deals in Europe and Japan. A subsequent tour followed, and after Michael and Steve each recorded solo albums, 1997 found AR returning once again with more great music in "THIRD DEGREE BURNS". TDB landed the band even better deals in Japan and Europe. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Arch+Rival">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
