NSBM band from Germany. Formed in 1998 by Negrobutcher. They have released three demos: 'Demo 1' in 1998, 'Eternal Strife' during the same year, and 'Aryan Blood' in 1999.

They also have five splits with "Capricornus", "Eisenwinter", "Evil" a Black Metal band from Brazil, "Satanic Warmaster" and a four-way split entitled 'Germeinschaftstontraeger' with "Flammentod", The True Frost, and Nordreich. A new split with the German nsbm band Tustra was set to be released in July 2011, but has suffered delays due to the temporary imprisonment of Pride (half of Tustra) for various counts of vandalism and violence. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Aryan+Blood">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
