Annihilation Text is a death metal band from Ontario, Canada. Initially formed in late 2005 under the name "First Fallen" by founding members Steve Hoier (guitar), Jesse Uliana (drums), Stuart Boland (bass) and Cory Gauthier (vocals). The core of the music was written within a few months after rehearsing almost daily, and eventually came to fruition at their debut show as support for Canada's Augury in April of 2006.

Frequent line-up changes throughout 2006 hampered the band's progress. In mid-late 2006 a stable line-up was obtained as well as a consensus on the direction and overall sound the band wanted to continue with. The band then changed its name to Annihilation Text.

In 2007 Annihilation Text released its debut effort 'Defamation Manifesto'. The band is currently working on new material for an upcoming full-length album.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Annihilation+Text">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
