(4) 404 (electronica)
404 is the sound of old school electronica with a dose of acid. Influenced by artistes such as Banco de Gaia, The Orb, Peter Gabriel, Underworld, ELO, Beloved and Paul Oakenfold, 404 combines an interesting mix of ambient techno with the orchestral. 404 started off with soundtrack work for commercials for Heineken, Motorola and Siemens amongst others, and for the occasional short film and this dreamy "music for films" feel is plainly evident.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/404">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
