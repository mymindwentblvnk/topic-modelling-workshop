Outlie biography:

Luke Pabich : Guitar & Vocals Sean Sellers : Drums Joe Raposo : Bass Donovan Cole : Guitar Members of Good Riddance/RKL/Last Season collaborate to bring you adult contemporary power rock. We have one record under our belts (Companions to Devils and Saints) which was released in 2004 on Porterhouse Records. Currently singer/songwriter Luke Pabich is working on an acoustic version of the band (Outlie-Acoustic...stay tuned for a separate myspace page). Our eventual goal will be to put out a record that has rock and acoustic versions of our songs...on one record. We need a label! Any labels who may be into working with us...please contact us through this site. Lates, Luke
