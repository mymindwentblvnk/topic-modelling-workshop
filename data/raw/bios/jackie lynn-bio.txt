This is what we know: Born and raised in Franklin, TN, in May of 2010, Jackie took a Greyhound bus from Franklin, TN to Chicago, IL. Upon her arrival in the city of Chicago, Jackie found a cheap sublet on the south side. She soon became acquainted with Tom Strong (real name unknown) on a short CTA bus trip to the Chicago Loop. We believe that Tom & Jackie together ran a multi-million dollar business distributing illegal substances around Chicago & the Chicago tri-state area for over four years. Authorities believe that a local automobile shop was used as the main distributions headquarter. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jackie+Lynn">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
