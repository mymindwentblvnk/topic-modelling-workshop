Sometime during fall in 2004, the base that would become Enemy of my Enemy was created. That was when Petter, Clabbo and Emil began working on some new ideas they had. This resulted in two songs that later got named “Distant Suns” and “You Think You Can Make Me” (now Sadistic). Shortly after that Patrik was asked by Clabbo if he wanted to audition for them. After some trouble and delays Patrik arrived to our local to try for the role as a singer. A couple of rehearsals together passed and it started to sound much better. Patriks place in the band as a singer was secured. Shortly after this, we got an offer to play at Elector here in Örebro and we realized we were one guitarist short. We asked Kim Aarseth Larsson if he wanted to fill in and he did it gladly. A while thereafter we started to look for a definite guitar player and we decided to hold a couple of auditions (if you could call it that). We filmed everything to be able to reflect afterwards over the players skills and to be able to discuss what we thought about them. A couple of people were tested and some of them ended up in very comic situations. We finally decided to go with Albin and thanks to him we were finally a full band. Since then everything has just run along smoothly. We have completed gig after gig, recorded three demos and the most important thing of them all, we have had a great time. When this is written we have eleven own songs and were in the middle of working with and rehearsing some new material. These eleven songs are being recorded and our debut album is planned to be finished around Mars/April if everything runs along as it should. Keep your ears open because we will absolutely not shut our mouths! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Enemy+of+my+Enemy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
