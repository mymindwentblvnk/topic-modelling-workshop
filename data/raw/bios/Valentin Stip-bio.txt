A trained pianist who grew up playing Rachmaninov and Mozart, Valentin Stip was recently turned on to the compositional possibilities of computers, and in doing so, to electronic music. Having moved to Montreal a few years ago, he signed his first EP, Anytime Will Do, in spring 2011 on Clown & Sunset. His musical output doesn’t rush to the finish line, embracing space while crafting woolly atmospheres. Valentin is a founding member of the Booma Collecitve and record label based in Montreal and has recently relocated in Berlin releasing several EP´s and singles on ¨Other People¨, Nicolas Jaar´s new label project. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Valentin+Stip">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
