FIREIGN were an independent Canadian metal band from the province of Newfoundland. The 4-piece band was formed in late June 2001 and consisted of members Trevor Leonard (Lead Guitar), Harry Clarke (Bass/Vocals), Brian King (Rhythm Guitar), and Dale Parsons (Drums). The band was originally called "Detonation" and they started by just jamming on old Metallica and Slayer songs. After realizing that there was already another band by the same name they decided to change their name to "FIREIGN". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fireign">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
