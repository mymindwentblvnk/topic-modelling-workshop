2.  Geneotype is a metal band from Hampshire, IL.  Formed in December 2010 by Charlie Esposito (Altered/The Darksiders) and Shaun Combee (Altered/Loki/Left for Dead). Ideas were exchanged and a platform was created. Kadie Kirby (vocals) joined shortly after and because of her background in stage performances and her love for macabre horror films/ femme metal groups she fit quite well with the dark allegro pieces being created. Tony Florio (Axis/Zero Hour) joined the ranks there after and adds the needed "thump" and "growl". Genotype then began writing and producing their debut self-titled album, it was independently released in February 2012. In June of 2012, Genotype was completed with the addition of Remington Roberts (Theophagy) on drums. Dave Zellers (Blackhawk Band, 12 Pack Pretty, Swift Kick) helped the band out by filling in as bassist for a bunch of shows, as Tony made his exit from the band in 2013. Justin Krotz was added to the lineup on bass in June 2013. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Genotype">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
