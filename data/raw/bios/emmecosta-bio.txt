Emmecosta are an post-club/electronic trio from Gothenburg, Sweden with Italian roots. The three members are Claudio Pallone and Alfonso Fusco from Positano and Aldo Axha from Milan. They describe their music as alternative dream pop that "creates intimate landscapes through a melancholic stream that merges with dream-like vocal stories".
They came to Sweden in 2010 to study art anthropology. They moved to Gothenburg, because they needed a new environment to develop their music.
It did not take long for Emmecosta to understand that Gothenburg was the place for them. There, Claudio and Alfonso Aldo met through studies and the three began to make music together. The northern air has influenced their overall sound, the new hometown has created new habits and routines when it comes to songwriting.

“When it comes to songwriting, or sound creation, we start by picking out a small detail; a single piece of a large puzzle, which is something dear to us. Then we build an epic scenario that evokes the truth in this unassuming little detail. ”
