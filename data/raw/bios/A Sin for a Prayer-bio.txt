Biography
A Sin For A Prayer is a four piece band based out of Mississauga, Ontario Canada.

A Sin For A Prayer started as the brainchild of Graham Stirrett - (Guitars) and Marc St.Laurent - (Guitars), when moving to Mississauga in 2006 for music production/engineering school. With an entire year of searching for members, in late 2007 the beginning of ASFAP would take shape with Jeff Morretta on Drums, Steve Sugrim on Bass and Kamil Miklenda on vocals. A Sin For A Prayer would go on to play shows in the GTA and surrounding areas for roughly 6 months until Kamil thought it was time for him to leave the band. At that time ASFAP would move on to a search for a new vocalist (John Bernardo). Adhering to a series of trials and tribulations over the course of 2 years asfap would continue playing more shows. As time went on asfap unfortunately had to go through more member changes due to a conflict of interest between members and persuing other goals. With a year of struggles having to replace Steve(bass), Jeff(drums) and eventually John(vocals), asfap would find Tiny Basstank(bass) and Nick Davey(drums), leaving asfap short a vocalist. After a year of rehearsing and vocalist seaching asfap wasn't having much luck finding a suitable front man. With much discussion and practice, Graham Stirrett(guitars) would take on the duties of front man holding down vocals as well as guitar.
