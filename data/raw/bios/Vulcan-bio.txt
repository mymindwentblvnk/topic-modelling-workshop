There are three artists going by this name

1. Vulcan is a man named Lyle Steece of rural Spencer, Iowa that recorded one "basement-psych guitar rock" LP in 1978. The single, obscure, and much sought after album could be described as highly psychedelic and "outrageously fucked, inspirational, distortion-overloaded, and massively mindblowing." It was dedicated to Jimi Hendrix, and rightfully so, considering the two artists' sounds.

2. Vulcan is also an underground Thrash Metal band from Pennsylvania that says "We play heavy fuckin metal, if you like it then rage with us, if not then Fuck Off! Enough said."

3. Drone Doom project, who released their first album in August of 2018. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vulcan">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
