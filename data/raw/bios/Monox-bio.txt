Monox is a death metal band from Rijeka, Croatia formed in 2002. According to the band members, Monox was created due to their wish to stop being merely passive consumers of music; they wished to create it as well.

For several years, they experimented with what kind of music they can create when five of them play together. In 2007, they settled on their own style, and a new era of Monox emerged.
