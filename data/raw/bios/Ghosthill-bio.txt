The Ghosthill was founded in spring, 2009 in the western part of Russia, the city of rainy clouds called Kaliningrad (former Koenigsberg). Rich history and cold waters of the Baltic Sea have awoken dark emotions of metal music in the band members' hearts. Despite the current music situation the band doesn't lose stimulus to play power metal. That spring, 2009 was devoted to the studio work and recording the first album called "Embrace of a Chasm". The album includes 10 tracks filled with epic, speed and heavy music combined with life and mystic lyrics. Check and enjoy it!  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ghosthill">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
