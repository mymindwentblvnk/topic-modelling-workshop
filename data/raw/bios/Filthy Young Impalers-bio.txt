In 2009, original drummer Carlos Gutierrez & guitarist Mario Torres started writing music together, eventually bringing in Zappa to join as vocalist/ bassist. The duo already had a song & Zappa had written some lyrics, & thus their first song, Fragile Apocalypse, was born. Lacking inspiration & focusing on high school at the time, the group fizzled out within 2 months. 
Come 2010, Zappa started attending Media Tech Institute where he had unlimited studio time. He called up his old buddies & brought the band back to life. During this time, they finally agreed on a band name suggested by Zappa, & proceeded to record 4 original songs & 1 cover. Lack of commitment ultimately fizzled out the group once more, not being active for 3 yrs. 
Within those years, Miguel Salazar came across some of the recorded songs & approached Zappa about the band. He brought in his younger brother, Mowgli, an amazing guitarist he met at Guitar Center, Chino Savage, & his friend/ bassist Brandon Maciel in March 2013.With material already set, the band was ready to blow away the masses. Due to tensions in the band, two bassist came & went, leaving it up to Elias to rip it up. Further tensions led to dismissing Miguel, putting the band on hiatus.
On the verge of a comeback after months of hard work, tragedy struck with the passing of Elias.. Forced to enter an indefinite hiatus with a future uncertain, the remaining members are doing what they can, waiting for the right time again.
After a long hiatus, the band have become active again after having local musician & friend step up to play bass. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Filthy+Young+Impalers">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
