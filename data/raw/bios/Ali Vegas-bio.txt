Ali Vegas is an underground rap artist from South Jamaica, Queens, New York. He is a close childhood friend of NBA Player Lamar Odom (Odom often affectionately calls Vegas his "cousin"; however, they are not related). He is currently signed to Odom's label Rich Soil.

He announced he is changing his name to "Hebrew 12:15" in honour of Odom's son, Jayden, who died at the age of 7 months in late June 2006. Jayden was born on December 15th, 2005. This album will feature production by DJ Premier, Shatek, Cookin Soul and Kanye West, who produced the record "The AV Theme" , which samples the SpongeBob SquarePants (character) theme song.

Vegas is also the co-owner of Rich Soil Entertainment, which he shares with Lamar Odom and is the owner of Council Recordings, home to the likes of underground favorites such as R.A.P., TRL, ImSoHood, and a long list of others. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ali+Vegas">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
