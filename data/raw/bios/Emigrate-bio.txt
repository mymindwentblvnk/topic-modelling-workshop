"Emigrate" is a project that has been growing since 2001.

The man responsible is Richard Kruspe (lead guitarist of "Rammstein"). The musician said he had a lot of inspirations and ideas that didn't fit Rammstein's new mentality. Therefore, Richard decided to found his own musical project to avoid negative tensions with the band; Emigrate was born. Kruspe started the band in 2005, when Rammstein decided to take a year off from touring and recording.

In a few interviews, Richard said Emigrate's sound would be similar to Rammstein's sound of the "Mutter" era, but some have found it to be much more commercial and rock oriented. The voice is clear and relatively high, reminding of "Godhead" and "Apoptygma Berzerk" sometimes. All the songs are sung in English.


The band is composed of 5 members :

Richard Z. Kruspe (guitar, vocals, lyrics)
Olsen Involtini (guitar)
Arnaud Giroux (bass)
Henka Johannson (drums)
Sascha Moser (programming)

Rammstein's manager Emanuel Fialik from Pilgrim Management is in charge of Emigrate.


The fans have had the chance to listen to the song "Wake Up" from the upcoming album. It has surprised a lot of people by the original sounding of the vocals and the almost-total absence of keyboard. Another song was released for fan download in late November, 2006, entitled "Babe". "My World" has been downloadable on the official Emigrate page since May 2007.

The first album, "Emigrate", was released on 31 August 2007.

Richard has put the Emigrate project on hold since 2008 due to Rammstein reuniting in the fall of 2007 to work on their new album.

Another album, "The Persistence Of Memory", was released on 17 December 2021.
