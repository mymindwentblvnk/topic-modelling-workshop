Darvulia was a rather obscure French black metal band.  Their music is eerily melodic, with desolate, dissonant, winding riffs that draw you in on a very hypnotic, subliminal level.  

The sound is distinctly French, somewhere between the depraved recordings of those in the LLN and newer progressive black metal styles (ie Blut Aus Nord).  

The band would also appear to be inspired by American punk and the classic Amphetamine Reptile sound. Darvulia shares a member with the chaotic drone-doom project called Habsyll. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Darvulia">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
