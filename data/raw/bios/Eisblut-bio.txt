Eisblut is a side project from Eisregen (a German dark metal band). They have extreme lyrics about death, torture, disease and blood.
At the moment, they got only one album - Schlachtwerk.
It's the song "Am Glockenseil", which is about a undead priest slaughtering a teen couple. This song is inspired by the film 'Paura nella citt√† dei morti viventi' (in Germany known as 'Ein Zombie hing am Glockenseil') by Lucio Fulci.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Eisblut">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
