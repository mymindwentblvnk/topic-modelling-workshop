Karna is a project which has been locating in a stage of coma during the last 13 years, and outgoing from that just for recording of every next album. This project doesn't have an own history, no fixed line-up, no rehearsals, no concerts. It's an amorphous cloth of chaos, disgorged from the abysses of non-existence just to dissolve without a trace in an endless and wonderful substance, that gives them a ghost of life...
