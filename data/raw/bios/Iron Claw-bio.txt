Iron Claw is a rock band which formed in Dumfries, Scotland in 1969. 

The band was formed by original members Jimmy Ronnie, Ian McDougall, and Alex Wilson. They were joined by singer Mike Waller in 1970. Wilson, the group's bass guitarist, decided to form a band after seeing a Led Zeppelin concert in 1969 and the band was eventually named after a lyric from King Crimson's "21st Century Schizoid Man". The band originally performed covers by blues rock artists such as Free, Johnny Winter, Ten Years After, and Taste but soon began writing and performing original compositions.

In 1971 Wilson decided to replace Waller with two new members (Wullie Davidson, vocals / harmonica / flute and Donald McLachlan, guitar) and changed the sound of the band in an art rock direction. In October 1971 McLachlan left the band. Drummer McDougall left in May 1972 and was replaced by Neil Cockayne. The group finally broke up in 1974. In 1993 Iron Claw performed one reunion show and in 2009 sixteen recorded songs were remastered and officially released on CD by Rockadrome Records

In response to the success of the Rockadrome album the band reformed in 2010 and began working on an album of new and unreleased material. This album is scheduled for international release by Ripple Music in autumn 2011. Current lineup is: Gordon Brown (vocals), Jimmy Ronnie (guitars), Alex Wilson (Bass) and Ian McDougall (Drums). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Iron+Claw">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
