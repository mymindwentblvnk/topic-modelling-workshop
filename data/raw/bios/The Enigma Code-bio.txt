The Enigma Code are a heavy metal band from Olney, Maryland. Their style is influenced by various genres with a mainly noted balance between melodic death metal, technical death metal, and deathcore. With recent release of their latest song, "Schismatic Catalyst," the band has began to push in a more progressive direction and has began to exhibit less of a deathcore sound. The band has also began to really build on their classical and jazz influences which look to be further displayed as they continue to write for their upcoming demo due out sometime in December of 2011. They have shared the stage with notable acts such as The Faceless, Decapitated, The Red Chord, Veil of Maya, Periphery, I, The Breather, As The Kingdom Falls, Oceano, Attila, Chelsea Grin, ABACABB, An Obscure Signal, and many other Maryland bands.

They will release their self-titled EP sometime either in September or October of 2011.
