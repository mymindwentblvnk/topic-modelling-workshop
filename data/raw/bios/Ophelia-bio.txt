There is more than one artist with the name Ophelia:

1. Ophelia are a metal band hailing from Chelmsford, Essex. Formed in late 2008, the band immediately started writing material and playing gigs in the local area. The spring of 2009 saw the band recording their debut E.P. at CDS Studios in Essex. By summer artwork and design had been finished, and the band raised money for CD replication throughout the autumn using a ‘presale scheme' that allowed fans to preorder and pay for the E.P. before it came out, ensuring them a signed copy. By the winter enough money had been raised, and on the 1st January 2010, Ophelia released their E.P. ‘The Blind Leading the Blind'. Ophelia are heavily influenced by the tight aggression of bands such as Chimaira and Pantera, and it is this quality that they attempt to convey through their music. The idea of controlled, precise, yet violent music is the forefront of their aim.
