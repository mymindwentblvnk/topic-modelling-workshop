Doom-metal.com  describes the band as "Melancholic Gothic Doom, elegant and thoughtful, a post-romantic musical inner-voyage through deep and tragic feelings. Despondent, full of despair and yet organic and warm." 

Morito Ergo Sum:  From the Latin, I die therefore I am. The idea of the band came up in mid March 2009. A long process of finding the right musicians began, with the aim of doing dark, heavy music, with some elements that stand out from the vast majority of the other doom metal bands out there: a real violin player together with a good non-growler vocalist.

After various attempts with different musicians, Walter Basile joined the band in April 2010 as the singer. His ghostly voice fits perfectly in the band's style, giving an even gloomier atmosphere to the songs.

In September 2010 we finally released a home demo, which can be downloaded at our Bandcamp  page.

The line up now is:
Walter Basile - Vocals & Drums
Paolo Cito - Guitar
Pablo Magallanes - Lead Guitar
Harry Virtanen - Bass
