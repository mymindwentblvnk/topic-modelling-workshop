www.fleshkraft.com  Band was formed back in 2003 when three guys, originated from same band, decided to form a new project. It was pretty clear from beginning, that the new project would be some sort of deathmetal. After making few decent songs, we decided to hire new players in band. Another guitarist and bassist were found and old bassist gave his effort on vocals. Finally the band found it's final form and got two songs on Tamperkele compilation. Feedback has been very promising. Currently we are making new songs, although we already have enough songs for gigs. First live appearance was in Tampere yo-talo 08.03.2006. We'll enter to studio soon to make a proper recording. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fleshkraft">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
