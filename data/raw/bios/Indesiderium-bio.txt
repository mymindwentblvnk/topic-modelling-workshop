Indesiderium is an American black metal band from los Angeles, California formed in 2012 by Atrum Abbas (Atrum Lorde) and Mattias Snyder. Their music is self-described as "crushing United States black metal from below the terrestrial planes, the lightless voids of the abyssal realms... the legion that is Indesiderium summon forth an ancient esoteric alchemy firmly rooted within the traditions of old. Unholy black metal invoked through the ashes of the elders, conjured by Atrum Lorde and Mattias through means of astral projection and meditative introspection."

Their debut Wanderer of the Abyssal Plains was released independently on 2015. Music was recorded and mixed during the winter and fall of 2014 by Seth Brooke at Vae Victus Productions Studios. Drums were recorded in fall of 2013 by Juan at Executor Studios and mastered by Jonsson at Dark Productions, except for "Nocturnal Isolation", recorded by Atrum Abbas at Abyssal Plains Studios.

Their upcoming sophomore Of Twilight and Evenfall​.​.​. is scheduled for release on October 30th, 2018 through Satanath Records, limited to 500 jewel case copies. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Indesiderium">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
