Cliffie Swan, formerly known as LIGHTS, is an avant-folk four-piece from Brooklyn that draws heavily on the 70ies psych-rock, funk and disco-pop traditions blending it with ethereal vocal arrangements/harmonies and a more contemporary drone input. The band is compromised of Sophia Knapp (words, gtr, vox), Linnea Vedder (drums, vox), Andy MacLead (bass, formerly of WHITE MAGIC) and Wizard Smoke (light show, visuals). Their self-titled debut was recorded by Greg Weeks (ESPERS) at the Hexham Head Studio and released through Language Of Stone (World) and Twisted Nerve (UK) to some critical acclaim. The band is known for their highly visually enhanced live shows. Their second album “Rites” is scheduled for July 21st 2009 on Drag City. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cliffie+Swan">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
