Indricothere is Colin Marston (Krallice, Dysrhythmia, Behold... the Arctopus, Gorguts). The sole recordings that make up the Indricothere LP were tracked on a computer in a dorm room when Colin was in college, long before his time in any of the aforementioned bands. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Indricothere">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
