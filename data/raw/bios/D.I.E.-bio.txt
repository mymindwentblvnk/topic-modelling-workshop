5) D.I.E. is a hardcore crossover from Botucatu - Brazil
The activities started in 2010 the meeting of two great friends wanting to make a sound fast, heavy and marked where the major focus of the letters would be social, cultural, political and religious.
So from August 2011, until the present day, we shared the stage with great bands such as: Korzus, Ratos de Por√£o, Torture Squad among others. We have made great buddies in the road, and proud to belong to the indepedent brazilian underground scene.
