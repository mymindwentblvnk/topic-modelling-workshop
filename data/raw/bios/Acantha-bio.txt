There are multiple artists using this name.

1. With the beginning stages stretching from 2004, Acantha has evolved over the last four years to be one of Edmonton's most ass slaying acts. Screams, solos, and ass slaying are the main focuses of the band, who have just released their longly awaited, ass slaying full-length, Eternal Punishment.

When asked to rate the album after listening to it, 7 out of 10 listeners agreed their asses had been slayed, and 3 out of 10 listeners were unable to give a response due to sudden comatose state. Scientists are puzzled.

2. Acantha is a rock band from Sarov, Russia. Initially formed in 2007 as post-hardcore four-piece. On May 9, 2008 they have released a demo of two songs: Dvoe ("Two") and Teenageboy. July, 2008 marked the end of their post-hardcore efforts and currently the band is working on a new material... 2022, still working. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Acantha">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
