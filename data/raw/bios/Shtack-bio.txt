Bram Claessen aka "Spaghetti Beard" and Thimo Gijezen aka "Dekzwabber" played some music together for a while, in the groovy blackmetal band "Stygian Sun" for instance, and both shared the love for metal. While Bram had millions of ideas for songs which wouldn't fit in the sound of Stygian Sun, Thimo was very excited about them. So in the spring of 2008 they decided to start a studioproject together. Soon it was clear that Bram's catchy melodies and Thimo's multi-instrumentalism fitted pretty good. Shtack is finishing their first self-produced EP "Zooi: The Mixtapes" and they have recently become a live band with drummer Tom aka "Thomas Ripbelly" (Stygian sun/Bleed For Glory).
