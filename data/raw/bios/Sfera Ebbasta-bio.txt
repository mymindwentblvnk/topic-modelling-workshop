Italian rapper Gionata Boschetti (aka Sfera Ebbasta), born in 1992 in Sesto San Giovanni, was raised in Cinisello Balsamo, a fact that he often referenced in his music. At the young age of 13, his father passed away, leaving Boschetti responsible for his mother and sister - a responsibility he coped with by writing rhymes. Although he dropped out of school, it wasn't long before he found the means to forge a successful rap career in Italy. Alongside close friend and producer Charlie Charles, Boschetti spent ten years perfecting his craft; by age 23, he was regarded as an emerging talent within the Italian rap scene. Together with Charles they founded their own brand, Billionheadz, through which they released merchandise and music; their first release was a mixtape titled XDVR Reloaded. Cinisello Balsamo - or Ciny as they referred to it - was located just outside of Milan, and in order to further pursue their dreams, both Boschetti and Charles moved to the bigger city, giving them access to a wider variety of media opportunities. By 2016, Boschetti released his debut self-titled album; this time through publication deals with Universal and Def Jam. Sfera Ebbasta featured two collaborative tracks with French rapper SCH, "Balenciaga" and "Cartine Cartier." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sfera+Ebbasta">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
