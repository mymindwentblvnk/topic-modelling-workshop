KAASI is the electronic outlet for British DJ Matthew Martin. 

Taking inspiration from the Majorcian mountain ranges he grew up in, KAASI has quickly become a name synonymous with today’s next generation of electronic artist. Born out of SoundCloud, KAASI gained a quick following after early releases such as ‘Caroline Street’ and ‘Work With Me’. Last year saw KAASI release his debut EP ‘Tramuntana’, which gave birth to his most well-known single ‘Those Days’, whilst also supporting ODESZA on the European leg tour of their world tour. 

With new music and tour dates in the pipeline, 2017 looks destined to be the break out year for this must watch artist.
