Formed in 1990 in Libice nad Cidlinou, Czech Republic under the name Devastator, they eventually changed their name to !T.O.O.H.!, an acronym for "The Obliteration of Humanity."  !T.O.O.H.! is hard to classify into one genre, showing elements of death metal, grind, folk-influence, and even progressive metal.  

They have released five albums: 

From Higher Will (1999)
Z vyšší vůle (2000) (The Czech version of "From Higher Will")
Pod vládou biče (2003) ("Under the Reign of the Whip" - recorded as a duo) 
Řád a trest (2005) ("Order and Punishment")
Demokratické řešení (2013) ("Democratic Solution")

!T.O.O.H.! disbanded shortly after putting the finishing touches on "Řád a trest" due to financial issues - caused in no small part by being dropped by Earache, who took the album out of print only two months after its release.

News about reactivation of !T.O.O.H.! appeared in September 2011. Over the next two years, brothers Humanoid (guitar/vocals) and Schizoid (drums) began writing material for a new album and scheduled several concerts. In February 2013, after their first show in years, it was announced that they would not perform live anymore due to difficulty with Humanoid's illness - also stating that their new album would be their last. On August 13, 2013, "Demokratické řešení" was released online as a free download.
