Location: Mankato, Minnesota

Bodies in Wake is an upcoming death metal band from southern Minnesota. The original lineup came together in late October 2008, with a new direction and a fresh writing style combining elements from multiple genres of brutal music with former and current members of a Mankato, Minnesota band, a Andover, Iowa band What Lies Within, and Twin Cities bands Malice in Reverie, The Divided Fall and Butchered.

After enduring lineup changes and the departure of good friend Ian Rinn (Phlegethon), Bodies in Wake has a full crew again and are writing and recording demos, refining a more technical style and preparing to start playing shows again and record in the months ahead!
