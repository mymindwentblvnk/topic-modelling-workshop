Bradley Burris (ex-Vale of Miscreation) and Brandon Gallegos (ex-Minusseven) have collaborated in the studio to bring the world Subtlety. Heavily influenced by modern death metal such as Beneath the Massacre, Hate Eternal, and Meshuggah, the duo create a trademark wall of sound  with gravity-blasts, off-time breakdowns and catchy arrangements coupled with socioeconomically aware lyrics. They currently reside in Albuquerque, New Mexico. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Subtlety">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
