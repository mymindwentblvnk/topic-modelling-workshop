Aminata Kabba (born 13 December 1994), better known by her stage name KABBA (formerly known as A*M*E), is a British pop singer.

KABBA moved to the United Kingdom at the age of 8, after her mother’s hair salon was burned to the ground and life in her birth country Sierra Leone became too dangerous. 

Growing up in the Catford area of South East London, KABBA found an early fan in Gary Barlow who eventually signed her to his label at the time, before she went on to feature on a string of hit records including the Grammy-nominated Duke Dumont collaboration “Need U (100%)”, MK’s “My Love 4 U”, and most recently M-22's “White Lies”.

In 2021, she released her self titled-debut EP, which saw her collaborate with long-term friends and Grammy Award winners MNEK and Ryan Ashley. The songs explore past and present struggles, including opening up about challenges with anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kabba">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
