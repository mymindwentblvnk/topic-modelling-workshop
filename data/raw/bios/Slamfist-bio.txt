Slamfist was founded as a mix of deathgrind and metalcore with a pagan background, forming Pagancore. Endorsed with artwork from Simon Bisley and by pornstar Misty Rain, slamfist first and only mini-album SKULLSMASHER was a reasonable succes. Altough the band had plans for a full length album, several splits in the workings and tours planned, the setup was quickly destroyed when Slamfist's drummer decided to leave. Altough replacments were sought after, the band could not survive the time spend doing nothing.

Fondlecorpse rose from the ashes of Slamfist and found it's base in Sly's and Rogier's creativity. Rogier sadly had to leave the project as time demanded his attentions elsewehere, luckily others stepped in and created the newfound Fondlecorpse ( http://www.last.fm/music/Fondlecorpse ).
