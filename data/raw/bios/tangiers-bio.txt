Tangiers are a Toronto-based indie rock band.

Josh Reichmann (vocals/guitars) and James Sayce (vocals/guitars) resuscitated Tangiers after two band members left the band in 2003, adding ex-Guided by Voices drummer Jon McCann and keyboardist Shelton Deverell to the lineup. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tangiers">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
