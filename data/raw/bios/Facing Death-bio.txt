Facing Death is a new death metal project that started out with a vision from Subcyde guitarist Ola Englund. He wanted to make death metal with lots of riffing and groove. It wasn't really meant to be serious but the songs rocked so he decided to go all the way and make a 4-song demo. All he needed was a singer. He asked Canopy singer Fredrik Huldtgren to join the project, which he did. A self-titled demo was recorded and is available on the website for downloads. 

New material has been written, and will most likely be recorded during 2010.
