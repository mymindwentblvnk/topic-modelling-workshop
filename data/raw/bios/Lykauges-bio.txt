Lykauges is an act from Greece, created on 2008 by Ghrundal and another individual. Finally it turned to be a one-man-act. The purpose of the band was to play Hellenic Black Metal, with Ancient Greek subjects and nihilistic views. Two months later, the band released its first demo, titled “Χαίρε Ζεύ” (that means “Hail Zeus”), which is extremely limited. This demo has been re-released, by the Italian cult underground Black Metal label, called “This Winter Will Last Forever” (50 copies, cd-r). At the same time, the band changed many session members, due to the band's plans for some live shows, but a little bit after, they left the band, because Ghrundal, decided that live shows do not appeal to depressive Black Metal that the band was playing that time. After a long time (March of 2009), Ghrundal decided to release a second demo, called “The Hope Is Dead”, in which it is clear that the band has changed its lyrical subjects. Also Lykauges participated on a split release with the legendary Greek Black Metal band Athos. The split cd is called ''Visions Inside The Dusk'' and it contains pure traditional Black Metal by both bands. In the dawn of 2010 the first official act of Ghrundal ''Under the Veil of Depression'' -full length album- released by the BM label Misanthropic Art Productions, and it contains Cold, Atmospheric Black Metal. Then, comes the release of a split CD with the Mexican Black Metal band Necrosadik, named "Hanging Illusions In A Cold World", released by "Victory By Fire" records. New album is out, titles "Swan Song", released by Misanthropic Art Productions with a more aggressive style. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lykauges">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
