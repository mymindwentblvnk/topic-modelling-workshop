chimaera has recently changed it's name into The dying, to stop the confusion with the american "chimaira"
Chimaera is a 5-piece band hailing from the north-east part of Belgium called Limburg (kindred, crawlspace, ashlar, full court press, kombat). Raised from the ashes of ?Burden? They started with Chimaera in the beginning of the year 2000, also the time xkoenx joined the forces. Chimaera created a sound you can probably describe as a mix between metal and hardcore. Technical and melodic metal with some midtempo hardcore riffs, and from time to time some aggressive blackmetal-mayhem. This is where Chimaera stands for on a musical level.

In September 2001 they decided to record their self-titled Mcd? to let people know their music and to get more shows. Things worked out very well since then and Chimaera played tons of gigs. They shared stages with: heaven shall burn, liar, throwdown, eighteen visions, congress, born from pain, kingpin, dead blue sky, circle, .calibre, give up the ghost, kombat, ? and much more cool bands. All those shows gave them a decent live-reputation and leaded to a record-deal with Genet recordings. In july 2003 Chimaera recorded their first full-length album ?Passion sets the killing? that will be released in October 2003. 9 songs of pure metalcore-mayhem will be unleashed to the crowd? Lyrics deal about very different subjects, because Chimaera wants to contribute as many issues as possible. Most of the time they deal about some essential problems in our society like: war, human- and animal liberation, racism, organised religion, ? but also about some personal things like friendship and love. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Chimaera">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
