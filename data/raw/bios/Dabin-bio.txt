Dabin Lee, Toronto, Canada

Dabin grew up playing and performing music all his life. His musical background of blues, indie and folk music influenced the melodic and rhythmic nature of his productions.

His first single 'We are the Night' caught the attention of major networks such as Dubstep.net and Vital FM. Since then, his productions have gained support from the likes of Benga, Modestep, Dirtyphonics, Felix Cartal, Dirtyloud, Vaski, The Killabits, Botnek, Reid Speed, Jillionaire (Major Lazer), as well as being played on BBC Radio 1 on Mistajam's Daily Dose of Dubstep.

Dabin's debut EP "Electropolitics" released in March 2012 topped the Beatport releases and peaked at 4th electro house release, 5th dubstep release and 5th drum and bass release. His later productions, including collaborations with YouTube sensation Daniela Andrade and Montreal based DJ/Production trio Black Tiger Sex Machine climbed their way into Beatport's top 50 dubstep singles and upon release, was the second hottest track on Soundcloud just below Dada Life.

With over 1,000,000 hits on YouTube and soundcloud alone, 2012 has been an establishing year for Dabin. With an upcoming EP, remixes and collaborations, expect a great finish to the year from this producer. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dabin">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
