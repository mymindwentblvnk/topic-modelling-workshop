(1) Dream Death is a thrash / doom metal band from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States, formed in 1985.

One of the best New Renaissance releases of the 1980s, their album "Journey Into Mystery" combined doom elements with hardcore-ish vocals and speed bursts - a style that is prevalent nowadays but rather unique for its time. The band broke up in early 1989, but reformed some time later with a modified lineup, and eventually a new name: Penance.
The band's three demos (two of them pre-Journey, the other recorded afterward) were compiled on a CD titled "Back From the Dead", released in early 2005.

The band reformed as Dream Death in 2011, while Penance are also very much an ongoing concern. Thery released "Somnium Excessum" in 2013.

Members:
Brian Lawrence - vocals, guitars (Penance)
Terry Weston - guitars (Penance)
Ted Williams - bass (Deathmass)
Mike Smail - drums (Cathedral, Internal Void, Penance, Pentagram)
