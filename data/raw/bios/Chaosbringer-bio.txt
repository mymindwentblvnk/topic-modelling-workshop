1.Chaosbringer(aka Le Bruit Qui Court, real name Julien Josserand) a former French darkcore musician, who now fronts the digital hardcore band Moshpit.

2.ChaosBringer is a metalband which was formed in the ashes of other different projects late 2005 when guitarists Jonas Vilander and Viktor Wallberg teamed up with drummer Andreas "Dunet" Thunell & vocalist Adam Sjöstrand. The band started rehearsing songs and trying out bassplayers. A couple of months later they found bassist Rickard Mårelius whom joined the band. They now focused on writing material for their first demo and finding gigs. In January 2007 their first demo entitled "Confront And Destroy" was released including 3 songs. Shortly after that, guitarist Viktor left the band to participate more on his other projects so the band needed an replacement ASAP. They found one almost right away. Viktor had a friend named Simon Lilja whom joined the band to take his place. Through the spring of 2006 they played some gigs with Simon until he quitted the band late May. Back on square one.. Viktor came back to help the band out and have been playing with them since.

CHAOSBRINGER are currently working on a new 4 song self titled demo that should be out soon. New gigs are also coming .. as for now .. ultimate experience.. word is spoken.. We are Chaosbringer and we bring the fucking chaos!
