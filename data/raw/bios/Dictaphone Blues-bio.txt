Dictaphone Blues is the brainchild of Edward Castelow, which began as a bedroom project in 2006.  Dictaphone Blues has been performing over the last several years with a revolving cast of characters from The Ruby Suns (a band which Edward has previously played drums in), Reduction Agents, Heavy Jones and Thee Conjurors. As of 2015, Dictaphone Blues has recorded and released 3 albums.

The band's lineup has changed several times. It's initial lineup consisted of Edward Castelow, Rob Collins and Myles Allpress. Their debut album On The Down And In  was released in 2009 on their bandcamp. In 2010, they released a limited edition 7" EP "Questionier". The band recorded their second album titled Beneath The Crystal Palace and released it in 2012. In 2014, Edward began recording the third Dictaphone Blues album by himself, and titled it Mufti Day. This was released in December 2014, and was followed by a New Zealand tour in support of its release. This tour included a new lineup, which now consists of Edward Castelow, Myles Allpress, Matthias Jordan and Barney Chunn. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dictaphone+Blues">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
