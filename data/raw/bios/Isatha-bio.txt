Isatha is a Hungarian folk metal band formed in January 2010 under the name Skogens Saga. The forming lineup was Attila Bulenda (bass), Borsi Csókás (female vocals), Bettina Kovács (violin), and Tamás Győrbíró (drums). They started writing songs following the Germanic melodic trend. Soon two guitarists, Tamás Tombor (lead) and Krisztián Németh (rhythm), joined them. In the summer of 2010, Gábor Kiss (growl vocals) and Luca Wellmann (keyboards) were also recruited. However, not very long after that, Kiss, Wellmann, and Csókás left the band. Judit Dauda was found to fill in the position of the female vocalist. Before the other positions could be filled, however, Németh also left. Norbert Dékány took the place of the rhythm guitarist in the winter of 2010, and by this time, the lead vocalist of Baskíria, Péter Rajna was recruited too, for growl vocals.
Not very long after that, the band decided to change musical direction and name; since the spring of 2011, their name has been Isatha, and they have turned towards Hungarian folk melodies instead of Germanic. Their first concert took place on May 7, 2011, in Vadvirág Táncház, Budapest. In the autumn of 2011, flute player Dóra Gerényi joined the band, but their violin player Bettina Kovács quit. In early 2012, the lead guitar player Tamás Tombor also quit the band; they were replaced by Ágnes Zöld on violin and Gábor Ferencz as lead guitarist. A year later, forming member and bass guitarist Attila Bulenda also quit, and his place was taken by Gergő Radev. In the summer of 2013, their first album was released entitled "Erdei regék" (Tales of the Forest). In the fall of 2013, Radev left the band after only a few months, and soon afterward violinist Ágnes Zöld also quit. Radev was replaced on bass by Péter Ágoston in October 2013. In January 2014, Dékány also left the band, and was soon replaced by Zsolt Harsányi.
