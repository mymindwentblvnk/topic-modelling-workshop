tsc have been described as the south-west's hottest new improvisation collective, forging together a fusion of sounds, styles and influences. Formed in 2006 and growing out of a regular meet in artists studios in Poole, Dorset, tsc have found a truly original sound in their instant compositions, shifting patterns and layered melodies. All multi-insturmentalists, a tsc set features anything from oboe to glockenspiel, musical saw to bodrum, alongside the more conventional guitar, bass and live programmed beats.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tsc">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
