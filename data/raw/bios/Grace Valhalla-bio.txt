Grace Valhalla has been producing music on her computer for six years. Recently she put them on jamendo sharing them as creative commons. 

She says about herself, that she is far from being professional and just wanted to produce something she likes to listen to. And expresses the hope of progression through passion. 

She has now released five albums : Peak~, Psychopathetic, WiRE, summerCamp and Valhalla Rising. 
Her first videoclip, for "99 %" is only composed of existing videos on the web using her music :
