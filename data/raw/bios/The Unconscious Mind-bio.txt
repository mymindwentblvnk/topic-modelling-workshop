BIO
Hailing from the South Shore Of Montreal, The Unconscious Mind mixes elements from Black, Death progressive and symphonic metal. The Band trademark sound has led to comparisons with some great bands like Old Man's Child, Dimmu Borgir, and Immortal for their black metal sonority and atmospheres. Since The Unconscious Mind include a modern touch of Death Metal, it has also often been compared to bands like Meshuggah and Decapitated in term of tightness and technical riffs. 

In 2009 the band released a demo called "Witness The Madness" which was recorded by a friend (Dany Leblanc) in his homemade studio. That particuliar event is what started it all: The band began to perform lots of show in the huge metal scene of Montreal and in i'ts region and they were very well received. Their success led them to build a strong fan base everywhere they go. They have shared the stage with awesome band like The Agonist, Derelict, Augury and many more. Even so, it's in 2012 that the band did make one of his biggest step by recording his first full lenght album. Recorded, Mixed and Mastered by Maxime Côté of HANDS OF DESPAIR and CATUVOLCUS, the release contains 10 tracks that put forth a totally upgrated composition style and sonority of "TUM". 

The album "where philosophers falls" contains 6 news songs and a completely redo song demo with differents riffs and ideas, plus it's great production sounding. It's sonority now perfectly reflect The Unconscious Mind vision thanks to Maxime Côté hard work and collaboration.Lots of projets awaits "TUM" like tours and shows around Canada and the making of their next album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Unconscious+Mind">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
