Snakehips are a British electronic music duo. The line-up consists of Oliver Lee and James Carter. Snakehips made their name with Hype Machine doing remixes for Banks, The Weeknd, Bondax and Wild Belle. They are best known for their 2015 single, "All My Friends". The pair crossed paths in Hong Kong in summer 2012, whilst working on separate projects at notable sake bar, Sake Bar Ginn. They bonded over similar music tastes and agreed to meet again to discuss all things music before the trip was over. Both Carter and Lee forgot this engagement; as luck would have it however, the pair were to be rekindled on a flight traveling to London and agreed to work together in the studio. After success working in the studio with Jane and Jeff Purse, the two decided to call the project Snakehips. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Snakehips">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
