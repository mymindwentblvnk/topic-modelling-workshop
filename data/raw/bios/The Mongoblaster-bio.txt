If you feel like the world needs acceptance, tolerance, undiscriminated love (towards everyone, just please don't let them sit right next to me on the bus), rainbows, flowers, children's laughter and all that sugar-coated shit, then it's time you give the Mongoblaster a go!

With twelve songs about midgets, intellectually impaired love, mute transexuals and having a great time on the dancefloor while handling a slight case of 3 chromosomes, the Mongoblaster shows you how the world could be a better place, once you admit that it is, in fact, populated by horrible people. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Mongoblaster">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
