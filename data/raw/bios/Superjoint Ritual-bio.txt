Superjoint Ritual is a metal band formed in 1993 from New Orleans, USA notably featuring Phil Anselmo of Pantera, Jimmy Bower of EyeHateGod (both of whom later played in Down), Kevin Bond, and country-music star Hank Williams III.

"Use Once and Destroy", their debut album, is a frenzied mix of hardcore, sludge, punk, and thrash metal. It was followed by "A Lethal Dose of American Hatred" just one year later.

Sadly, shortly after a tour in support of the album, disagreements between Anselmo and one of the other band members regarding the band's direction brought the project to a halt just before a third album was going to be released in 2004. Jimmy Bower has since confirmed that the band will not be reuniting.

2014 : Superjoint Ritual have reformed (under the name "Superjoint" for legal reasons) and will perform at this year's Housecore Horror Film Festival. They are also scheduled to play at Hellfest in 2015. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Superjoint+Ritual">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
