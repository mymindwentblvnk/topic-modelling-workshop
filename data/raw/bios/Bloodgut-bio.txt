The BLOODGUT awoke to feed 2004. BLOODGUT is Roger Johansson (Demiurg, Paganizer, Ribspreader) grinding brainchild. If you like Autopsy and Impetigo chances are you won't like Bloodgut the slightest. However chances are also that you will. Bloodgut doesn't care. Bloodgut just wants you to bleed. And feed on your guts. Mastered by Dan Swanö (Edge of Sanity, Bloodbath).

BLOODGUT performs the utmost dirty, doomy and grindy DEATH metal you can imagine. Or not.

Line-Up: Rogga Johansson – vocals, guitars & bass Matthias Fiebig - Drums
