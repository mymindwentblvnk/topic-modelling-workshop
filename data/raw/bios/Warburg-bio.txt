Founded in August 2004, the band has quickly created its own style to represent Metal. Fast riffs, paired with hymnlike vocals and a touch of folk characterize their songs. In addition the band delights fans with a creative stage show on their gigs since the beginning of 2005. Inspired by the positive reactions the band has concentrated on songwriting and recorded their Demo, which is now prepared for release as the debut EP - with this the band hopes to inspire as many Metal fans as possible.
