The RAH Band was a fictitious studio based group (fictitious in that it was no group, it contained only him); RAH being the initials for Richard Anthony Hewson. In 1977 Hewson wrote an instrumental called "The Crunch", which was a huge success and climbed to number 6 in the UK Singles Chart. Hewson played all the musical instruments himself. The second hit single for the RAH Band was in 1985, when the soul ballad "Clouds Across the Moon", also reached number 6 in the UK Chart. This single was recorded in conjunction with his wife.

The RAH Band also released five records during the past 30 years.
In July 2007 Hewson released a remixed "Clouds Across The Moon '07" now featuring vocalist Emma Charles. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Rah+Band">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
