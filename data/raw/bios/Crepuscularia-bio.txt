This two-piece raw-doom metal band comes from Domodedovo (Russia). The project had been started in 2000 by LordPain and Vindir. In 2005 Crepuscularia became one-man-band, because Vindir left the project. The band has probably splitten up, but nothing is confirmed as of yet. The sound may appeal to the fans of raw doom-death like Rigor Sardonicous or Imindain. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Crepuscularia">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
