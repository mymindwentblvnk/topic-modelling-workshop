The second publish followed it, which was planned to out with 7 songs, but because some new songs recorded during that time, it grew up to 15 tracks, which is the second work: Sötét Prófécia.

„I don’t know how long it will be act, because it depends only myself. So it isn’t plausible to conclude the band’s working. I like to do it.

At first, primarily thanks to Varg to charmed me with his earlier works, Aske and Burzum, why for his invidual voice got moved things in me. The secund is Ancient. Hereby also the older ones, especial „Chainian Chronicle”, which is a huge influence. And of course, I can’t miss out Ragnarok, All my awe is them…”    <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Aetherius+Obscuritas">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
