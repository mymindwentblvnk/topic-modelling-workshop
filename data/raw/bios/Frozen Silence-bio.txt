Licence Frozen Silence tunes to professional productions via Jamendo PRO

Frozen Silence is a project of Finnish hobbyist composer/producer Matti Paalanen. It consists of quite minimalistic and melancholic solo harp, solo piano and solo guitar tunes, creating atmospheres which are quite hard to categorize. Melancholic neo-classical new age?

Many of the tunes are improvised and produced during night time in his home studio with one-try-for-each-track recording technique, which mimics live performance.
