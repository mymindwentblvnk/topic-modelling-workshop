Hardly any online information is available for DJ Pollie Pop, a Houston-based disc jockey and remix artist. This personality is famous for taking already well-known radio hits and club favorites to their next level, so to speak, by chopping and screwing the tunes and virtually re-inventing them for Dirty-South music lovers.

The love and appreciation for the art of chopping and screwing music is mostly appreciated by urban music lovers in Southern state cities like Houston, New Orleans and Atlanta.

Pollie Pop is notably the most famous of the "choppers-and-screwers", and most of his music can be purchased at convenience store counters on different digital formats or through online retailers.

His collections are usually compiled in numbered volumes listed with titles like Wet N Da Mood, Screwed Up Radio, Dirty Popsicle or Cup of Drank.

He has been nicknamed as Pollie Pop Tha DJ aka The Prince of SCREWED & CHOPPED MUSIC.     <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pollie+Pop">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
