Reido is a metal-band from Minsk, Belarus. The first full-length album "F:\all" was released in May 2006 by Solitude Productions. The band performed funeral doom death metal with some sludge tendencies and industrial electronics. 
In October 2006 Reido recorded the song called "Detect Memory", which was uploaded to the Internet as a single release. "Detect Memory" had more sludge riffs though they were combined with doom death. This song can be determined as a connecting link between the first an the second albums.
The second full-length album called "Minus Eleven" (or -11) was released on 11/11/11 by Slow Burn Records. This work consists no doom death but groovy sludge doom with some math metal rhythms.
