Formed in 2007, DFC set out with the intent of writing some of the most fast, brutal and technical music, the likes of which the state had never seen. The brain child of bassist Brad and guitarist Tristan, several songs were written and made into demos even before Dan and Blake were recruited on drums and vocals respectively. Learning the programmed demos with haste, the band set about a strict rehearsal regime, leading up to their debut gig in January 2008. 

Early reviews were very promising, and local hype about this top speed, brutal death metal machine grew. Not ones to waste any time, the band self recorded a crusty demo, entitled 'Got Sack?', playing several gigs in support of it. The writing continued unabated and the band played shows supporting heavy acts from around the country and state. 

With a wealth of shows under their belt, DFC recorded the 'Splitroast' EP, showcasing the skills of each member, while the songs at all times remained catchy, brutal and streamlined. Production having improved considerably, the EP has so far garnered excellent response from their peers within the genre. Numerous shows booked in the wake the this brutal release, 2009 looks to be the year DFC establishes their foothold in the national heavy scene.
