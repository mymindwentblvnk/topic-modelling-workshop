Two-piece depressive rock/ambient/post-rock band from Ängelholm, Sweden, formed in 2008 by Tobias Lindberg (also in Abomination, Tobias Lindberg: Världsillusionen) and Karl Hoverman  (also in Sire Nahvas).

Karl departed from the band later the same year and Alexander Larsson  (also in Forlorn Remembrance) takes his place.

A full-length album is planned for late 2011/early 2012.

Their self-released demo "Days Of Desolation" and their 2011 EP "En Studie I Ensamhet" are available for listening on http://www.myspace.com/svartnad
