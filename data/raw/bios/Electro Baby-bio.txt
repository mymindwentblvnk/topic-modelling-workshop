ELECTRO BABY were founded in 2001 and hail from the near back forest in Germany. They started with a four-headed Stoner-Rock-Band. El Matador – vocals, Robmaster Flash – Guitar, Mr. Olli Buster – bass and The Drumgod on drums. 2002 the EP “Grrr…!” was released which was categorised as pure Stoner Rock. 2003 on the second album called “Electro Baby Land” the group explored the boundaries to Heavy Metal. The third album “Electro Baby” was released in 2007 on Abandon Records – freshly on board was the new member The Neighbour playing the second guitar. After all the band found its own sound which is a mixture of THE HELLACOPTERS, QUEENS OF THE STONE AGE, MONSTER MAGNET and PANTERA. Electro Baby calls its simply PSYCHEDELIC STONER METAL. In 2010 the current album “Speye” was released on Eucalypdisc Records. Dusty metal-riffs and flying sound-tapestries pioneer their journey towards the psycho-supernova. With their fourth record the five power packs show once more, that they push their style through without reserve and don't give a ratt's ass about any frontiers of sub-genres. Stoner Rock, Doom Metal, Indie, as well as 70th psychedelia settled in with Electro Baby and founded an august family. At the beginning of 2011 THE NEIGHBOUR and ELECTRO BABY split up and guitarist KIM PAGE (CANNONBALL, EX-THE STARFUCKERS) joined the band. Live the crowd has to face fat rock-walls, coupled with billowing space-guitars and punchy retro-wave-sounds. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Electro+Baby">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
