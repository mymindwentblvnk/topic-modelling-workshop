Mutoid Man is an American metal band formed February 4, 2012 in Brooklyn, NY by vocalist/guitarist Stephen Brodsky and drummer Ben Koller. Their music is a high energy blend of progressive riffs with elements of psychedelic rock, sludge metal, and stoner metal. They released their debut EP Helium Head through Magic Bullet on November 29, 2013. Brodsky also recorded bass tracks for the EP while Nick Cageao (live sound engineer, formerly of Br√∂hammer) played live bass. They signed to Sargent House in 2014 and released their debut full-length album Bleeder in June 2015. Cageao has since become a core member of the band as he wrote and played on Bleeder.

Stephen Brodsky has been the vocalist and guitarist of Cave In since its formation in 1995 and Ben Koller has been the drummer of Converge since 1999. Both members have also played in each of those bands at some point; Brodsky was Converge's bassist from 1997 to 1998 and Koller was Cave In's drummer from 2005 to 2006.
