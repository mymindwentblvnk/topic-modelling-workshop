To be able to give a somewhat accurate description of what Gnadab entails, it is important to take a look at the intentions behind the music.
The three men from Alphen aan den Rijn, The Netherlands have been engaged in fun and enjoying their own creations since 2008. To them, it's not important to be found listenable or danceable. Or acceptable, for that matter. They are not interested in having a big fan base, successful tours and busty groupies. The core of Gnadab is to create music on their own terms and at their own pace. Music that they themselves appreciate.

This musical spectrum is broad, but mainly consists of extreme metal variants. Within two minutes in the same track it's possible to hear black metal transforming into slam, calming down into melodic post-rock, only to build up to chaotic thrash. Furthermore, the music is characterized by unconventional rhythms, strange structures and dissonance.

They released their debut album 'I' in 2012, followed by an EP titled 'Metal â€ ' in 2016. A new, yet to be named full-length release will be available early 2018.
