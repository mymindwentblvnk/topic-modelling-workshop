Françoiz Breut (b. 10 Dec 1969, Cherbourg France) is a French singer and professional illustrator. Her music might be categorized as french pop; however, contrary to "popular" notions of contemporary "pop", her melodies are often restrained, melancholy and sombre.  She sings primarily in French, with an occasional song in English or Spanish, frequently working with collaborators on music and lyrics.

Discography
Her first, self-titled album was released in 1997 ("Françoiz Breut"). Her second album was the 2000 "Vingt à Trente Mille Jours" (20 to 30 thousand days); this second album was long awaited by fans, and helped broaden her exposure and appeal internationally.  In 2005, "Une saison volée" was released.  Most recently, after numerous tours in France and abroad (notably Germany), she released in 2008 her latest album, "à l'aveuglette" (roughly translated as "blindly" -- as in, searching).

She is on numerous compilations (such as the popular "Le Pop" compilation series of "la nouvelle scène française"), and also appears on Calexico's live DVD "World Drifts In: Live at the Barbican" (2004).

By any other name...
The name "Françoiz Breut" is a pseudonym; this name itself was purportedly adopted by Ms. Breut after her original stage name, Françoiz Brrr, was incorrectly reported in the media.  (The sound is roughly similar; "Brrr" (or "Breut") would be pronounced like "brew" or "broot".)
