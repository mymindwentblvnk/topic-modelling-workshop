Mephitic Entities was formed in 2003 by the two guitarists Adriano and Athos. The line-up was completed during that year as drummer Stibe and bass-player Geri joined the band.

Over the past couple of years the band has played different venues in Switzerland, such as Bad Bonn (Duedingen), Dynamo (Zuerich), Sous Le Pont/Reithalle (Berne), Kulturwerk/Hellvetia Day (Sursee), Aarehuette (Worblaufen), and Open-air Under the Bridge. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mephitic+Entities">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
