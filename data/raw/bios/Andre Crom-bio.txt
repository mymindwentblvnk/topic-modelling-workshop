Andre Crom from Germany, had an amazing start into 2013: a #1 Beatport Deephouse Charts hit (Teenage Mutants & Hanging On).  Besides that, both his label and himself entered the „mostcharted labels/artists of 2012 list of Resident Advisor with # 8 for OFF Recordings and # 40 for Andre Crom.  The future does not look bad either: solo shows and label showcases all over the world are confirmed for the first half of 2013, including key events such as Sonar, A.D.E. and several ibiza gigs.

What's the reason for this popularity? Quite simple, Andre Crom and OFF Recordings release music to give people on the dancefloor a good time.

The sound selection is moving fluidly from deep underground pop tunes over big primetime records, from jacking house to reduced groovetools - diversity and fresh trends are welcome and keep things interesting.

The OFF sound, as well as Andre's own productions, take influences from all kinds of musical genres such as disco, 80s pop, jazz, funk, soul, blues, and hip hop with house, produced in a modern yet raw, cutting-edge style.

However, it's Andre Crom's sets, playing a mix of his own productions, unreleased OFF signings and carefully selected new tracks, grooving behind the decks just as much as the crowd on the floor – that are the best proof for his deep and profound love for house music and a good party. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Andre+Crom">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
