A group that has sung together for more than 60 years, The Zion Harmonizers have repeatedly won every local  award for gospel in their city and have performed all over the world.

Benjamin Maxon organized the Zion Harmonizers in 1939 out of an old neighborhood in New Orleans known as "New Zion."  Over the years, the personnel has changed a little and the Zion Harmonizers have added a few instrumentalists, but they still rely heavily on four-part harmony in the old-time a cappella style. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Zion+Harmonizers">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
