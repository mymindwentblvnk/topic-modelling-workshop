Riff driven southern metal/sludge metal with absolute relentlessness. Emerging from Atlanta, Georgia in 2012, Degradations exist to spawn their own style of riff heavy intensity. From sounds of slow doom that seem to ooze from the swamp to fast intensity of shattering glass and concrete with the full run of voice from gravely melody to disturbing screams that seem to come from the bowels of hell itself....

Degradations released their debut, Degradations, on 22 October 2013.

Dylan Kilgore: Vocals (Waited, ex-Withered)
