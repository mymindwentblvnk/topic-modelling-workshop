In 2007, Chris Rushing and GaÃ«l Pirlot began a project with the intention of juxtaposing challenging compositions with melodic ideas; the result became The Universe Divide.  The project became dormant as the two exhausted their hopes of finding a percussionist and began focusing on other musical endeavors (Canvas Solaris, The Burden of Existence).  However, in 2009, a chance encounter with drummer Jason Parker revived the project and the quest for intergalactic entropy.

2010 has brought the trio out of rehearsal and onto multiple stages across Atlanta.  The new 5 song E.P. "Dust Settles on the Odontophobes" produced by Jamie King at The Basement Recording was released June 2011.
