The Cave Singers is an American folk trio from Seattle, Washington. Their music is folk for a rainy day: surprising, yet cozy, sparse, yet harmonious, pleasing yet torturous.

Rising from the ashes of Pretty Girls Make Graves after its disbandment in 2007, former PGMG-member Derek Fudesco teamed up with Pete Quirk (of Hint Hint) and Marty Lund (of Cobra High) and began playing in the Seattle area. Soon after the band's conception, The Cave Singers signed with Matador Records on June 11, 2007. The band spent time recording in Vancouver with music engineer Colin Stewart, who quickly produced the band's first full-length LP. Before releasing The Cave Singers' debut album, Invitation Songs, the band released the limited edition pre-release 7" "Seeds Of Night" including the b side "After The First Baptism" on August 2, 2007. A month later, Invitation Songs was released on September 25, 2007 and met with critical acclaim. The second single from Invitation Songs, "Dancing On Our Graves", was released on February 25, 2008.

On 18th August, The Cave Singers released their second album 'Welcome Joy', featuring guest appearances from Amber and Ashley Webber from Lightning Dust. Matador Records gave away a free download of one of the new tracks, 'Beach House' to fans.
