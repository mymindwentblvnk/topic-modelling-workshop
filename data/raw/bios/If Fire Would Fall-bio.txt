If Fire Would Fall blend a wide variety of styles with face-pounding metal riffs, complex rhythms and intense lyrics to form a unique sound that will leave you whimpering like a child. IFWF have spend four years honing their craft and are now back with a new line-up, a new sound and a new intensity.

After a successful (and great fun) UK tour with Cilice in 2007, IFWF are looking to be somewhere close to IN YOUR FACE in 2008! With gigs and a new EP planned for Feb/March and tours in August & September, IFWF are paving the way for a whole new take on metal.
