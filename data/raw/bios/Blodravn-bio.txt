Blodravn, created in late 2010, is the one-man Folk/Viking metal project of Eyolf the Wanderer. 

It has heavy folk influence, and the lyrics are based off of Ásatrú beliefs and tales set in the Viking Age. 
The vocals are mainly in two styles: Clean & black metal screams, though very low guttural vocals may be heard occasionally. 
Most of the songs have an uplifting, adventurous feel about them, but some segments are angry/sad as well.

The album "Words of the High One" was released on Septemberr 12, 2011 under Hunter's Moon Records.
