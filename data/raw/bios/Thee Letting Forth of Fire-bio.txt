Thee Letting Forth of Fire is a progressive/experimental metal band out of Yakima, Washington. They are a seven piece band known for writing dark, epic scores which translate in to one huge song live.  They released an independent full-length record June 2nd of 2007 entitled "Carry Your Ash" which has six songs and clocks in at just over an hour's worth of music.

Members include Jason Blanchard (guitar), Alixandria Buchanan (keyboards/synth/vocals), David Buchanan (guitar/vocals), Jeffrey Hyatt (bass/vocals), James Paullin (guitar), Joshua Vega (drums) & Alyssa Vega (keyboards/synth).

Since TLFOF is not on a label you can purchase their records from the band's Myspace which is located here and from Interpunk here

In August of 2008 TLFOF released a split tape with the Spokane Metal-Hardcore band BEHOLD.  TLFOF's side contained one song entitled "Son of an Exorcist" and it topped just over 26 minutes.  This is the band's longest and darkest song to date and it marks a transition for them.  It is much different from the 2007 release "Carry your ash..." and it is barely percieveable that the same band released the previous "Are we bleeding him dry?"  The band is always progressing and constantly looking to push the conceivable boundaries of their music.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Thee+Letting+Forth+Of+Fire">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
