Deadlystrain born in 2003 from 4 young guys: Alberto Racanati, Mauro Belgiovine, Nazareno Cosentino and Gaetano Cavallaro. Since the beginning the band was focused on death metal changing many influences along the time, in order to achieve a brutal sound with no compromises.
After many line up changes Giorgio Cavaliere(Scavenger, Shizen) joins the band.
Now Deadlystrain released their brand new Mcd "Extinction", and they're searching for a label.
