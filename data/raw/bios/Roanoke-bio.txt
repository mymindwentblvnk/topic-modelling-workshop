Roanoke refers to at least four bands.

1) Roanoke is a three-piece sludge-doom act from the rain-lashed city of Portland, Oregon, consisting of three members: Todd Janeczek on guitar and vocals, Larry Pike on drums and James Kosharek on bass. They generally play slow, noisy and downtuned sludge-doom in the vein of Buried at Sea, though some tracks show a quicker style in the vein of Corrupted.

2) Roanoke, was a four piece band from Rockford, Illinois that merged screamo, post-hardcore, post-rock ambiance and emotional yells while experimenting with odd notes and chords.

3) Emerging from the states that brought America bitter border wars and ballot stuffing, Roanoke is a Kansas City, Kan. quintet chaotically churning out, "...twisty-turny alternative rock with elements of hardcore, metal, and prog-rock thrown into the mix," (Pastepunk.com). After selling out of its initial run of Distaste, the band's debut full-length, in May of 2006, the band released a new six-song EP in June of 2007. Produced by Aaron Crawford (Flee The Seen, Hang Glider Empire), the new EP is chock-full of catchy refrains amid jarring tempo shifts and heavy progressions. The revolution will not be televised. Rather, it will be streamed online or picked up at a show near you! 

4) alt. country rock band consisting of Josh Crawford, Joel Bond, Tim Buskey and drummer R.J. they broke up a while ago. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Roanoke">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
