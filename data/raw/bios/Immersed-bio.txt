Immersed came to be in January 2008, when members from prominent local Ottawa death metal bands: Mark Phillips (frontman of Epocholypse), Mike Chambers (guitarist of Dysphoria), and Stef Kushneriuk (drummer of Darkness Rites), joined together to unleash their shared vision of face tearing death metal.

Despite lack of a complete lineup, raw creative energy drew the attention of several other musicians, some of whom had played shows with them in different bands over the years. After jamming with a few guitarists and bassists, they found the remaining members of Immersed with Stephan Meloche (guitars of Dysphoria) in July 2008, and Gareth Allix (vocals of Remnants of a Deity) on bass in January 2009.

Continuing on forth, they released an untitled demo in April 2009 with the songs "Howling from the Grave" and "Cower Neath His Shadow". They played a lineup of shows in 2009 that included playing alongside Quo Vadis, Martyr, Threat Signal, Darkness Rites, Endemise, My Giant, and Insurrection.

Now in 2010, they head to the studio in Montreal, to record their first full length album entitled "In The Ire of Creation"; with Christopher Bradley (guitars/Beneath the Massacre) producing and recording, and Christian Donaldson (Cryptopsy/Garage Studios) handling drum production, mixing and mastering.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Immersed">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
