JOY. Is a producer- singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Olivia McCarthy from Brisbane, Australia. She crafts ethereal and introspective electronic-pop songs anchored by sultry, hypnotic vocals, incisive song writing and a keen focus on production.

In her relatively short run, the ambitious multihyphenate has graduated from solo bedroom recordings, including her debut single 'Captured', to her acclaimed debut EP, ODE, which landed #1 on the iTunes electronic charts in mid-2015 and has been streamed over 5 million times to date. Additionally, JOY. has garnered strong support from influential tastemakers by the likes of Nylon magazine, which proclaimed, “JOY. could be Australia’s next great pop export”, and Beats1 creative center Zane Lowe, who earmarked JOY. as ‘One to Watch’ at 2015’s Beats Sound Symposium in Sydney.

Following the release of her self produced EP ODE, JOY completed a sold-out Australian tour and also performed at festivals such as Vivid Sydney’s inaugural one-day music festival Curve Ball, and the annual electronic festival Listen Out. In 2017 JOY. Supported Kehlani on her sold-out Australian tour.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Joy.">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
