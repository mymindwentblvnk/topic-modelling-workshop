New year, new blood. Kahn steps forward from the shadows of the Bristol underground to deliver a killer double A side debut 12” release for Punch Drunk Records. The immediacy of Kahn’s brand of electrostatic synths and stirring, moody grooves are sure to rapidly ascend his profile in 2011.

"Like We Used To" strikingly layers a neck snapping rhythm with mutated soulful vocals, whilst "Helter Skelter" brings enough irresistible bump and flex to move any dancefloor. Kahn’s basslines may eminate from Bristol, but prepare to feel the resonance worldwide.
