There are two artists using the name "Klute": 

1) Klute is the moniker for drum and bass artist Tom Withers,  

Tom Withers aka Klute, has been a fixture on the Drum and Bass scene for over fifteen years, lending his creativity to the likes of Hospital Records, 31 Records, Metalheadz and his early stable Certificate 18, responsible for releasing his first two albums, "Casual Bodies" and "Fear of People". He is from London, UK. 

In 2001, his own Commercial Suicide imprint was borne out of a necessity on Klute's part to control his own releases as well as provide a support network for the ever increasing new generation of like minded producers. So far the label has seen releases by Klute himself, Calibre, Total Science, Digital, Amit, Break and Silent Witness. Previous to this much lauded and rebellious electronic career, Klute fronted legendary Skate-Punk outfit 'The Stupids', an apt schooling for a producer with this unique level of eclecticism.

Klute has released three double-albums on Commercial Suicide so far (distributed by Breakbeat Science in North America). The first, "Lie, Cheat & Steal," included a second album titled "You Should Be Ashamed," which followed a techno blueprint with exceptional results. The second release, "No One's Listening Anymore," was more straight-ahead drum 'n' bass with several vocal experiments. 2007 saw the third double-album, "The Emperor's New Clothes," featuring some of his best work yet, including tracks like "The Struggle," the beautiful "Never Never," and the slow but brooding "174 BPM."

2) Claus Larsen's (Leæther Strip) metal-industrial, aggro electro-industrial side-project established in 1991, which has since been 'respelled' to Klutæ in 2006.   (For complete Biography See Klutæ)
