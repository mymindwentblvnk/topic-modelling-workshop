Cultus Sanguine was an Italian dark metal band formed in 1993 in Milan, Italy. Their music was a weird and original mixture of doom metal, gothic metal and black metal, with a very melancholic and depressive sound, only comparable to Deinonychus.
The band always remained somehow obscure to the metal public and has split up in 2001.
