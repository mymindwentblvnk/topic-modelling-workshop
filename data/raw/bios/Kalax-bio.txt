Liverpool based producer and synthwave artist, Lee Blanshard, aka Kalax, has a background as a vocalist and bass player in several metal/alternative bands, but since 2006, he’s produced electronic music inspired by his mother’s 80’s cassette and vinyl collection which he grew up listening to, and also by 80’s movies like The NeverEnding Story, The Flight Of The Navigator and Legend. Since his debut EP, Journey (2013), he has released two EP’s and two full-length albums, and has performed a whole host of live shows. Several of his tracks will also be featured in the 2021 Documentary RoboDoc: The Creation of RoboCop. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kalax">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
