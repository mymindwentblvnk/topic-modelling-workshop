You may not be familiar with the name Priscilla Renea, but you’ve definitely heard some of the songs she’s penned. The singer-songwriter cowrote Rihanna’s “California King Bed,” Pitbull and Kesha’s “Timber,” Fifth Harmony’s “Worth It,” and Selena Gomez’s “Who Says” (among others). She’s also dabbled as a solo artist; she was signed to Capitol Records at 18-years-old in 2009, after gaining millions of views on YouTube, and even released her own debut album, Jukebox, that same year. But until recently, she had been focusing all of her efforts on songwriting. Now, she’s ready to step back into the spotlight, and she’s got a new name—and fierce fashion look—to go with her R&B-pop sound. World, meet Muni Long.
“Muni Long is the part of me that I always needed. She’s the protector of Priscilla,” Long tells Vogue. “I knew I wanted to focus on me. I’ve been serving others for the last 12 years, and I started to feel unappreciated and captive.” During her songwriting days, the singer was diagnosed with lupus, and she says having the disease ignited an even bigger desire in her to revive her solo work. “It really put things into perspective,” Long says. “I was like, ‘If I die, I will be so pissed, having never gone after the things that I wanted.’ That's really what set it off.” By the end of the year, Long will release her first EP as Muni Long—under Supergiant Records, her own label—that she wrote before COVID-19. She’s already rolled out two singles and music videos from it, both of which reflect her new strong, fabulous persona through fashion while working with celebrity stylist Jason Rembert to cultivate a bold new look. (He also styles Issa Rae, Mary J. Blige, and more). “Since Jason has come along, I love how powerful and beautiful I look,” says Long.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Muni+Long">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
