Lean Year is Richmond, Virginia based singer Emilie Rex and filmmaker/musician Rick Alverson. Equally informed by the minimalist folk music of Elizabeth Cotton, Karen Dalton, and Fred Neil; the tenuous, ambient, and orchestral works of Harold Budd, Brian Eno, and John Cale; the quietly pointed but tender songs of Nina Simone and Bessie Smith; and the baroque pop subversions of Love and The Left Banke—the inspirations for Lean Year are as varied as Rex and Alverson’s biographies. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lean+Year">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
