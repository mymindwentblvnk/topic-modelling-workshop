Erial are a heavy metal band from Sabadell, Barcelona (Spain). Formed in November 2003 after the dissolution of several members previous band, Sterilis Solum. Since the beginning the band tried to differentiate its sound from the typical female-vocalist metal band and tried to make a harder sound  influenced by 90´s Megadeth albums and classical hard-rock vocalists like Whitesnake´s David Coverdale.

Original members were Sergi Rubio (guitar), Edgar Gual (bass), Arcadio Montero(drums), Carles Pardo (keyvboards), Manel Benitez (guitar) and Sandra García de Gregorio (vocals).

They recorded several demos: Despertar (2004), No Morirá(2004), Erial(2005) and Bahía (2006). During this 2004-2006 period the band performed 70 gigs  being supporters of some big hard-rock bands in spain (Barricada, Lujuria, SilverFist).

After May 2006 Sandra García left the band to become singer of TheNewFlesh. Since then ERIAL lineup changed several times: Silvana Gelmetti and Cristina Obsidiana (Obsidian Lost) occupied vocals during 2007 and Dani Misery was playing bass after Edgar Gual left the band to join DIA-X. 

Most of previous demos of the band were re-recorded during this period, but this new mixes has not been edited yet.

During 2008 the rest of original members has been occupied in their other projects: Noctervm, DIA-X and Ars Maligna.
