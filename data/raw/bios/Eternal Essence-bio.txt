Eternal Essence formed in 2004 with the founding members EJ Luna, Greg Rosenblit, & Josh Samlin. They started out as a three piece instrumental band consisting of piano, bass, & drums. With the trio
they released three albums: Sleep by Water (2004), A Time & Space (2005), & Shifting Phases (2006). In the winter of 2006 EJ found Gary Hoffman, and it was instant chemistry. In the spring of 2007 Eternal Essence entered Shorefire Studios in Long Branch, NJ. They produced their most well known album to date “The Infinite Procession” which has currently been sold all over the world.

Between the years of 2004 – 2008 Eternal Essence remained an instrumental band playing countless shows all over NJ, PA, & NY. The band competed in numerous Battle of the Bands competitions, and made it to the finals on many occasions. Throughout that time they were also featured in numerous newspapers, magazines, & radio stations. In the winter & spring of 2009, EE went through over 15+ singer tryouts trying to piece together the perfect singer for the band. In May of 2009, they finally found the missing link in Ariel Le Fey. The first two shows with her were at The Stony Pony in Asbury Park, NJ & The Starland Ballroom in
Sayreville, NJ. Eternal Essence is in the process right now of writing a brand new album that will be their most diverse album yet. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Eternal+Essence">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
