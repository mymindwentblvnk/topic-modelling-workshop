Convulsing is a one-man Extreme Metal project of Australian musician Brendan Sloan (also of Dumbsaint). It seeks to hybridise various aspects of a lifetime of broad listening while tilting primarily towards the experimental sound of bands like Pyrrhon, Discordance Axis, Ulcerate and Krallice. 

Its debut recording "Errata" was released on 26 November 2016 for digital PWYW download on http://convulsing.bandcamp.com/ <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Convulsing">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
