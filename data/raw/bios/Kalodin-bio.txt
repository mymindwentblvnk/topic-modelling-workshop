Kalodin is a musical outfit consisting of 4 central members, with occasional collaborative ventures featuring several guest artistes, and their creative contributions to various projects. 

The members of Kalodin hitherto include Davin Shakya on lead guitars, OmEO on rhythm guitar, Bikash Rai on bass guitar, and Kiew Jay Joel on vocals. 

Kalodin is currently unsigned, self written, recorded and produced; with a full-length album released, entitled "The Bestial Ritualism of Harlotry" (2010).

Kalodin's music follows closely after, but not restricted to, the audio subcultures of modern rock and roll; namely within the metal genre.

Listeners can expect to enjoy a large incorporation of heavy metal, death metal, black metal and symphonic melodies.

Regardless if one prefers dark and heavy guitar rhythms over the quaking hell-swept speed of percussion beats, or even the sheer fury of vocal grunts and screams; Kalodin ensures that there is something for everyone. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kalodin">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
