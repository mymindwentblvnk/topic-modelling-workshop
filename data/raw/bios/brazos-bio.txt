Brazos is an American indie band currently based in Brooklyn, New York. 

The band began in Austin, Texas, as the solo recording project of Martin McNulty Crane. After two solo EPs, Crane recruited and honed a three-piece band and in November of 2009, Brazos released it's first album, Phosphorescent Blues. A national tour opening for White Denim followed. 

With new band-members Spencer Zahn (bass) (who moonlights in Empress Of's band) and Ian Chang (drums), Brazos released the album Saltwater in May 2013. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Brazos">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
