Amorticure is a melancholic / Gothic Rock Band from Germany.

After the First Album Release "Die Reise" in 2005, which contains eight Black Metal Songs, the Band decided to do something more emotional. Johannesthe Guitar-Player and Songwriter started writing more powerful and rocking Songs. Matthias adjusted his lyrics and wrote from then about inner struggles and the tragical Side of Life. Tom Falk turned the old blastbeats into Real Rock Drums.

The Second Album "a bleeding Soul in a dying World", released in febr. 2010, is Amorticures First Dark Rock Album. The Feedback on "a bleeding Soul..." is convincing.

German Music magazines like zillo and Orkus and several Metal webzines like Nightshade, evilrockshard or madgoth write beneficial Reviews and articles.

In June 2010 Amorticure got signed to Bruno KrammsÂ´ Danse Macabre Label.

The new Album "still alive" is planned for 2013. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Amorticure">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
