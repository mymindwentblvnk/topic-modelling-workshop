Lovage is a project headed by Dan the Automator under his alias "Nathaniel Merriweather" (a persona he created for the project Handsome Boy Modeling School). The album is called Music To Make Love To Your Old Lady By, a collaboration with Mike Patton and Jennifer Charles of Elysian Fields, who both provide vocals. Kid Koala plays turntables and samples.

In an interview with MTV in 2006, Patton claimed that he and Dan the Automator are planning a follow up album but are unsure of Charles' involvement.

"The Lovage music is done for the most part but weâ€™re just waiting for Mike and Jennifer to get together and write again," Kid Koala stated in an interview from 2010. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lovage">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
