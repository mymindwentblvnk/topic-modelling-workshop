A sensitive socialite raised in Brooklyn, Richie Quake sounds like he creates in those moments of clarity as your inebriation peaks and the sun rises. With a cinematic, retro-indie sound and Quakeâ€™s crooning vocals, Richie weaves periodic spaces between jointed musicality and pure instrumentation, crafting an element of softness and fresh air. Acting as the main writer, producer, and instrumentalist on all his music, Richie designs his own world of sensitivity and raw emotion. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Richie+Quake">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
