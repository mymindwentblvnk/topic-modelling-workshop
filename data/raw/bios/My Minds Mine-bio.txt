My Minds Mine started in 1995 as a four piece to create some furious grindcore. Basic idea was to give it a good old "in your face" feeling. Influence were taken from bands as Napalm Death/Heresy/SOB/Brutal Truth, etc. After having done some gigs a demotape was recorded, soon to be followed by a CD/LP. In the time that followed My minds mine did gigs in Holland/ Belgium/ Germany/ France/ Poland and did a Japan tour in 2000. In August 2002 My Minds Mine called it a day. 2 members continued as Blood I Bleed which will release their 7" very soon on Fast and Furious. My Minds Mine played lots of gigs during its existence with bands like: NAPALM DEATH, NASUM, HELLNATION, AGATHOCLES, ENTRAILS MASSACRE, ROT, INTESTINAL DISEASE, ABUSO SONORO, BLOOD, MALIGNANT TUMOUR, Y, LAST DAYS OF HUMANITY, ABSTAIN, COMRADES, SEEIN RED, IDIOCY OF GROTESQUE.
