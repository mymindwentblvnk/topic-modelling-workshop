Hailed by many as one of the harshest digital noise artists, DCLXVI (a Montana-based experimental/harsh noise/audio/visual project) was started in 1998 by Patrick Fernandes. The first officially released album, "Thank You For The Memories" came out on Negatron Heavy Industries in 2001 and was the first attempt at creating digital noise/soundscapes. The second release, "Le Poison Fantastique", focused on being more themed and structured. It was also released on Negatron Heavy Industries. Since then, Patrick Fernandes started his own label, Oubliette Records, which has since released three DCLXVI related projects. DCLXVI also worked on various splits with other noise/experimental artists such as Xome, Groyxo, and Pop Culture Rape Victim. Past DCLXVI releases have included collaborations with artist/filmmaker Kristie Alshaibi, artist Asya Schween and visual artist/contortionist Fleeky Flanco. More recent projects include sound work on a short film entitled "The Little One" and a soundtrack for an upcoming full length noise based feature by filmmaker Adam Wingard. The DCLXVI project will continue to expand and evolve providing a very unique and interesting audio and visual experience. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/DCLXVI">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
