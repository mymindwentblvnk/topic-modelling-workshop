In 2002 Nae'blis and Christfucker created Anti-Christian Assault in order to spew out some blasphemous obscenities against Christianity accompanied by fast and furious black metal. After a series of mishaps the first and only Anti-Christian Assault recording was released in 2006 on CD by Daydream Nightmares Productions in a limited edition of 500 copies. A tape version was later released by Wulfrune Worxxx in a limited edition of 300 copies. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Anti-Christian+Assault">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
