Richard Cheese and Lounge Against the Machine are a cover band and comedy act based in Los Angeles, California. The band's name is a play on that of rock band Rage Against The Machine, and Cheese's pseudonym is a reference to smegma. The band specializes in playing jazz and lounge covers of popular rock and rap tunes from the last thirty years, particularly those with offensive lyrical content...

Since 2000, the band has played concerts around the U.S.A. and Europe, and has made numerous television appearances, including performances on Jimmy Kimmel Live, Fox News Channel, CNN, and as the house band on NBC's Last Call with Carson Daly and MTV's Say What? Karaoke series.
