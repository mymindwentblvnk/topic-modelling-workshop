Funeral Suits are a 4-piece alternative rock band from Ireland.
Consisting of Brian James, Mik McKeogh, Dar Grant and Greg McCarthy, the band formed in 2008. 
A shared love of epic, distorted guitars, blistering harmonius pop, art rock and electronica led to the band spending the best part of two years holed up in a disused office space in deepest North County Dublin, writing, rehearsing and at times venturing out to play as special guests for Franz Ferdinand, Passion Pit, The Maccabees, Local Natives amongst other.
More recently they have just recorded and finished their debut album with acclaimed producer Stephen Street (Blur, The Smiths) which will be released on June 4th (Model Citizen via PIAS).
Current single ‘All Those Friendly People’ out now
These are Funeral Suits. Take them and break them. Let them into your world.
