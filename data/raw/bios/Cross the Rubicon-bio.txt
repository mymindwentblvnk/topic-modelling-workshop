Cross The Rubicon is a deathcore band from Solon, OH, formed by current guitarist Steve Perrino and former drummer Brant Lally in August, 2007. They've changed a lot over the year that they've been around, including lineup, genre, etc. They started as a metalcore band (as I lay dying, killswitch engage, bleeding through, etc) but now focus on a more death metal/hardcore style (Emmure, The Acacia Strain, Whitechapel, Catalepsy, etc). Their current line up consists of Anthony Puleo on Vocals, Steve Perrino on guitar, Angus Szilagyi on guitar, Winston Thomas-Greaves on bass, and Ty Castro on drums.
