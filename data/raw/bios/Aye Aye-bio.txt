Aye Aye migrated from Madagascar to Salamanca in 2005-2006. Aye Aye..s first steps were taken in experimental theatre but always with live music as an essential part in their performances. Aye Aye’s performances have counted on the support of various friends, each and every one of them contributing their valuable artistic talents. Acting, script writing, painting and madness all had room in the delirious voyage of a gloomy psychopath, the vital journey of a hobo, and a few colleagues enjoying a surrealistic dinner. Parting from these theatrical performances Aye Aye decided to form itself exclusively as a band in 2006-2007. Those in the service of the lemur come from different cities. Pablo Mestres (Guitar, vocals and floral ornamentation), and his brother Juan C. Mestres (base, chorus and swing) are from Vigo; Eduardo Vizán (Keybord, synthesizer and mental delusions) from León; and Nick O..neill (aka "Hot lunch" aka "Todd") From Bristol. Aye Aye’s style is still under construction (probably because of their denial of the tyranny of the music we are forced to contemplate) but if we must be labeled, we would say: “Ok, if you say so!” - Which includes psychedelia, progression and the desire to move others. For this difficult task we counted on the invaluable help of Manuel Cabezalí from Havalina Blu, with whom we recorded, in his cave in Madrid, our first Ep “Aye Aye emite sonidos”. Five songs that capture the essence of the band’s live music and which you can listen to here. In Salamanca, the altruism and support given us by the bar, Malabar, allowed us to firmly develop the lemur’s thoughts, hence our thanks and fond mention here. And as for us… what can we do if we were chosen by Daubentonia?  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Aye+aye">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
