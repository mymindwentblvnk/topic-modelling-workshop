The original lineup was a carry over from Billâ€™s previous group, Kingdom of Snakes. It featured Jason Gerken (Open Hand) on the drums, Jason Blackmore (Molly McGuire) on the guitar, Gabe Cardinale (Dead Twins) on bass and keys, and Bill Gaal on vocals and guitar. This is the lineup that recorded the debut album, KINGDOM SESSIONS:VOLUME ONE.

The second lineup of the band featured Michael Johnson (Capra) on drums, Mike Pelletier (Kilgore) on guitar, Mike Castunguay on bass, and Bill Gaal on vocals and guitar. This version of the group never recorded in the studio, but instead spent 2 years playing shows in California.

The third, and current, lineup of the band currently consists of Chris Houck (Nothingface) on drums, Mike Longworth (Kisses for Kings, PRONG) on guitar, and Bill Gaal on vocals, guitar, and bass. The band just wrapped up recording of the 2nd album, anticipating an early 2012 release.
