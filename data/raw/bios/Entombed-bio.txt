Entombed is a death metal band from Stockholm, Sweden which formed in 1989 after the dissolution of Nihilist. Though Entombed began their career as an early pioneer of Scandinavian death metal, by the early 1990s their sound had broadened to include groove metal, alternative metal and hard rock.

Entombed's debut album was Left Hand Path, a cult favorite that established the band as a popular death metal band. The follow-up, Clandestine, was just as popular. These first two albums were unique in that they featured what was sometimes referred to as a "chainsaw" guitar sound which became a staple of Swedish death metal worldwide. It was created using the Boss Heavy Metal distortion pedal and a Peavey amplifier. This iconic guitar tone spawned the niche sub-genre referred to as 'entombedcore' which consists of just hardcore bands using the infamous chainsaw tone as part of their sound.

After the Gods of Grind tour, Entombed began changing their sound into a mix of groove metal, hard rock and death metal frequently called death n roll. Although this may have turned off many fans, it established their mainstream and critical reputation. Wolverine Blues and Hollowman are widely considered classics of early 1990s death metal, but were followed by problems with various record companies.

In 1999, Entombed released Uprising, which was an anti-commercial return to the band's roots. The follow-up, Morning Star returned to Hollowman and Wolverine Blues style metal. They have since released 2003's album Inferno, a continuation of the 'death n roll' style that has become their trademark sound.

2006 saw the release of new music from Entombed, with the When in Sodom EP on June 6 (or 06/06/06), and the full length album Serpent Saints - The Ten Amendments was released on July 9th, 2007. This album is the group's first release with drummer Olle Dahlstedt (of Alpha Safari and ex-Misery Loves Co.), who replaced long-time drummer Peter Stjärnvind in 2006.

they reunite in 2016 after winning the case of entombed name.
