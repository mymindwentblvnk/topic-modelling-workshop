Bandcamp

Current Line-up: 
J. Kostamo - Guitars & vocals
A. Klemm - Bass & vocals
M. Kallio - Drums

Seal Of Beleth was formed in late 2007 by J. Kostamo (Lathspell) and A. Klemm (Lathspell, Scarecrow), then adding drummer P. Klemm to the line-up. After two years of occasional rehearsing, P. Klemm decide to call it quits and was replaced by M. Kallio (ex-Spiriticum, Kuolo). 
Since the beginning of 2010, S.O.B. was no longer a project, consentrating on recording the material written earlier. During summer 2010 the first promo was recorded at Patologian Laboratorio Studio. 
The musical influences are taken from what we like to listen, all kinds of doom, sludge, post-metal such as Isis and Cult Of Luna, even black and death metal. We are not bound by any rules or genres, we create Doom Metal as we like to hear it. With lyrical content spanning from the occult to everyday misery, we infuse our music with a sinister message.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Seal+Of+Beleth">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
