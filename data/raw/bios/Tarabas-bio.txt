Tarabas from Magdeburg (Germany) was founded in summer 2003 by Bassist Steve Kuhnert and Guitarist and Vocalist (Screams) Alexander "Kutte" May. After a short time Guitarist and Vocalist (Growls) Karl-Ludwig "Ludo" Stephan and Drummer Cassian "Cas" Heim joined the band. Their music combines Melodic Death Metal elements, clean guitarparts and heroic melodies. 
The Lyrics are dedicated to the past without being bond on common myths. Often the writers acces to their own fantasy and imaginations to give these old days an special character, and are related to battles, brotherhood, faith and honour.
