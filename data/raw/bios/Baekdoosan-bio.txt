Baekdoosan (백두산) is a legendary Korean metal band formed in the mid 80's and they were considered as the ones who pioneered the Korean metal scene.

The elites of the Korean metal or music scene in general will surely remember Baekdoosan as the band maybe is one of their influences and maybe because the vocalist had produced their albums (as Yoo Hyun Sang is a highly sought after producer in Korea) or Axeman's Brilliant Guitar works, named Kim Do Kyoon, as guitar genius.

Last Summer 2008 they announced that they would be reforming with the original line-up after 20 years of absence to the music scene. Appearances to big Korean music festivals are confirmed and a new album (fourth over-all) which is fittingly titled “Return of the King” will be out on the 20th of April via Dope Entertainment Korea. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Baekdoosan">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
