4. AD is an electro-industrial band from Turku, Finland. It has been described as "Captain Beefheart meets Ministry" and "Bj√∂rk on acid", both very accurate descriptions. This AD was originally founded in the 80s, released three vinyl albums (AD!, Beirut, and Vladivostok), and disappeared. At the request of Tocapo Viracocha, AD was reactivated at the end of 2004. The comeback album, Tocapo! was released in April 2005 by Plastic Passion.

In September 2006 independent record labels Plastic Passion and Kenolamusic released AD's new album Bodysuit. The album is "perhaps the hardest electro album ever released in Finland".
