Admiral of Black formed in the summer of 2008 and have been making an impact since their inception.

After only five months of being a band AOB was invited and flown out to L.A. to perform at the Hollywood Guitar Center by Nikki Sixx's Eleven Seven Music, 10th Street Entertainment, Gibson, and Guitar Center, in a private showcase with a handful of the country's top up-and-coming bands.

Their debut album "The Hand of Chaos" was independently released on June 5, 2009 at the historic Metro in Chicago. For the time being, the only thing AOB want to do is live in their van touring as much as possible spreading their brand of booze rock.
