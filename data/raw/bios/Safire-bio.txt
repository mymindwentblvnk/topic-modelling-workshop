Safire, born Wilma Cosme in San Juan, Puerto Rico, is a New York City freestyle singer-songwriter who has been one of the Freestyle genre's most popular female performers. She started her singing career as a session vocalist. An audition for the Cutting Records label broke her into the mainstream. She had successful run of classic 80s pop singles such as "Don't Break My Heart", "Let Me Be the One", "Boy I've Been Told", and "Thinking of You".  After her sophomore album "I Wasn't Born Yesterday", her career stalled a bit over the 90s as other genres eclipsed freestyle, but she has continued to tour to a base of loyal fans. She released her third album, "Atrevida", a Salsa album in 1996. Safire's fourth album "Bringing Back the Groove" released in 2001 brought her back to the charts with the hits "Don't Break My Heart 2002" and a Freestyle rendition of the New Edition hit "Can You Stand The Rain. Her most recent single is the hit Dance song, "Exotique."
