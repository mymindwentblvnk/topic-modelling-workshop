Blackhoney comes from the deepest swamps of Hungary to blow your face off with their heavy, head banging, southern sounded music. Since the band kicked off back in 2011, their style turned to a more nasty and darker way, which is reflected by their first record, called ’Kneel Down’. They shifted to full throttle in 2012, when they became a trio and their line up has settled. In the past years the band toured all over the country and now ready to play their first few shows outside. Live performaces often described as loud as a chainsaw and grinding like an axe. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Blackhoney">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
