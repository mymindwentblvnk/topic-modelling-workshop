Vibrator Failure created in autumn 2007 with takis (guitar/bass/vocals), panos (lead guitar), kostas (berimbao) and john (drums) representing the first line-up. The band is based in Kalamata (Greece) and their music is porn death rock.

On February 2008, with the same line-up, the first demo CD called “Rector's Rectum Räccoon” was released. The CD was limited to 300 copies and it stopped being available in about a month. There was a download available on the band's website for quite awhile and the number of downloads exceeded their expectations. The “Rector's Rectum Räccoon” got reviews ranging from very bad to good.

After the release of the demo, Panos and John left the band and Sakis was the new drummer, simultaneously the band pressed their first t-shirt.

Summer 2008 the band participated in the “Auricular Morbidity” compilation of Noise Wreckage Production with 4 tracks from their demo, the compilation was released on CD-r and cassette.

The band is now working on 11 new tracks...  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/vibrator+failure">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
