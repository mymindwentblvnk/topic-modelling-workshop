Q.W.A.N. was an unsigned thrash metal band from Falun, Sweden more or less active between the years 1998-2005. The acronym Q.W.A.N. stands for "Quality Without A Name". Consisting of a group of young friends with a shared love for heavy metal, they started practicing in the bedroom of the bands drummer. As the band members grew and started to define their own sound, they soon became a big name among the local demo bands in Falun at the time. Eventually they decided to split up when members of the band left town to focus on their studies. Their influences varied slightly over the years, but their last and most acclaimed self-tiled demo released in 2004 showcased a refined, aggressive and raw sound receiving promising reviews in an assorted number of Swedish metal magazines.
