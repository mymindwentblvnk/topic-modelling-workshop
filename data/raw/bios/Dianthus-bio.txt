Dianthus is a heavy rock act with twin sisters, Jessica and Jackie Parry.

The synergistic sound and seemingly-telepathic energy behind Dianthus can be traced to their beginnings in the heart of Riverside, California. Inspired by the perennial flower, these twin sisters bring forth delicate, yet dominant voices to the rock scene. An early upbringing in classical piano led them to begin creating music together at a young age. Not long after, they were captivated by heavier genres. The two enhanced their musical palettes with the addition of drums and electric guitar. Since forming, Dianthus has gained the likes of well-respected musicians such as Matt Sorum (Guns ‘N Roses/Velvet Revolver/Hollywood Vampires/The Cult) and Jeremy ‘Jinxx’ Ferguson (Black Veil Brides). The band was recognized in their city and were bestowed the “Riverside Pride Success Award”, presented by the Riverside Mayor and City Council. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dianthus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
