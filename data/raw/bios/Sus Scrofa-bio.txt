Sus Scrofa is a French Black Metal band formed by Breiner (Zöldïer Noïz), Yan Arexis and Patrick Lafforgue (Stille Volk, La Breiche). Sus Scrofa is considered one of the first french pagan metal bands, formed in 1991. The band released two demos, Paganus and Dins ech cel d'Asteartia, before breaking up in 1994. The band reformed in 2014 and later released their third recording Sinistre Sylve in 2015. Sus Scrofa shares many similarities with Arexis' and Lafforgue's other projects like Stille Volk and La Breiche by incorporating folk instrumentation and themes rooted in Pyrenean paganism and mythology. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sus+Scrofa">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
