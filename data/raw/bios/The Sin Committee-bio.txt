The Sin Committee is a metal quartet from Nijmegen, the Netherlands, formed in 2006. The band combines clean vocals and harmonizing guitar melodies with grunts and more aggressive guitar work. Influences can be heard from various other bands, including Tool, Opeth, Mastodon and System of a Down. While their first release “Wormwood” was essentially home recorded, their recent EP “Confess” was recorded with the help of producer Erwin Hermsen (Mangled, Collision) of Toneshed Recording Studio. Confess was released on March 2009 and reflects a break with the band’s earlier work which was characterised by less complex song structures and clean vocals only.

Since its release, “Confess" has been received well by the international music press:

Zwaremetalen
 “Hurray for the EP of our own Dutch The Sin Committee with its beautiful artwork and kick-ass songs!” 

Teeth of the Divine
 “The songs are hummably melodic and catchy, yet rip-your-face-off heavy in places. It’s just one hell of a good EP” 

Archaic magazine
 “…Fans of progressive metal definitely need to hear this EP.” 

Metalfanatix
 “… I wouldn’t be surprised to see a record label grab these guys for their roster.” 

Heavymetal Heaven
 “.. an impressive piece of work that The Sin Committee offers” 

Metal Territory
 “… one hopes that they sign the right deal, which, on this evidence is just around the corner.” 

Tempelores
 “The band is currently unsigned, but I would say this EP opens doors for them.”
