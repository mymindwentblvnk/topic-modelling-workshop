The Midwinter was formed 1992 by Mikael Paloj√§rvi in finland at small industrial town, Kemi. In the beginning band started to play death metal with thrash metal elements (mainly because bands founder and composer Mikael (Vocals, guitar) was influenced bands like Carcass, Slayer, Stone and Kreator in childhood). The last official EP "The Frozen Lakes of Loviatar" was released at 1999. In 2008 Mikael and Janne (drummer) started to play "for the old times sake" but soon they realize that old spark was still there so Mikael started to compose new material. Band's old bassist Mikko joined in the crew afterwards and finally in spring 2011 they found lead guitarist Petri. Now in the end of 2011 The Midwinter has complete brand new EP called "Trails to the Apocalypse". The style has changed to more thrash oriented, although there is still elements from death metal etc. Lyrical theme has changed from finnish northern mythology to society oriented and more into apocalypse / post-apocalypse style.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Midwinter">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
