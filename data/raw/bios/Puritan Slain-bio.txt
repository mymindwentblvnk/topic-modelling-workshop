Puritan Slain are a 5 piece metal band from the Isle of Wight, UK. The band consists of James Hetfield (guitar/vocals) Shaun Reed (lead guitar) Ben Smith (rhythm guitar) Darron Murrant (bass guitar) and Matthew Wade (drums). 

The band was originally formed in 1995 by James and Matthew, but was short lived at the time due to other commitments in life. The band resurfaced in 2006 with what is recognised as the first ‘official’ line up of the band who went on to record both the bands debut EP ‘Everything Ends’ in 2007 and the first full length album ‘Origin:Unkown?’ in 2008 which featured input from current bassist Darron. 

After this time the band went through several line up changes, firstly adding Darron as bassist, followed shortly by Shaun as lead guitarist. The band then began writing material for an as yet unreleased EP and playing shows until they added Ben as a third guitarist in 2010 which the band felt would help create a solid ‘wall of sound’ and allow them to become more intricate and creative with song writing. After a ‘breaking in’ period the band began writing material for their second and current album titled ‘A Matter of Life and Death’ which was released worldwide on the 3rd of June 2011.

The band are currently seeking opportunities for shows across the UK to promote the album and also looking for representation to help them transcend to the next level, and reach a greater audience.
