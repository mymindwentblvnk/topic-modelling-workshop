Killer Watt were a Speed Metal Band From Dublin Ireland. The band was started back in 1985 by drummer Steve and bassist Sid who recruited Marcus burns on guitar but in 1986 Marcus left the band. Soon after that Ratz took over on guitar and Git on vocals. They rehearsed in the old Temple Lane Studios in Temple Bar Dublin. In 1987 they recorded a 3 track EP which got into the Irish Top 30 chart at the time. Soon after that they decided to add a second guitarist so Derek Sweeney joined, also that year they appeared on the Irish TV Music Show Mega Mix doing a cover of the Sex Pistols track Pretty Vacant. In 1988 the band decided to split-up.
