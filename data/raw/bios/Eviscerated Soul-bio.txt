Eviscerated Soul Started out as DISSENT In Luke Kohuts Basement with Tom Carmichael on Lead Guitar and Garret Swlko on lead vocals. Shortly after we picked up Nick Gravina as the bass player. Tom Carmichael lef thte band to Move to Fort Collins and pursue education. Brent was then brought in to play guitar and soon after little Nick was brought in for support in the axe area. They are still together playing the same songs as they did years ago, check out the blast-o-mat,  Panther COuntry, I think they still play there? They are harcore, grindcore style.
