Thrash/Industrial band from Barcelona, Spain. Formed in 1986. 

Founded in November 1986, without a name, and took the moniker Ktulu in early 1987, after Metallica's The Call of Ktulu instrumental composition (in turn, inspired by the writings of HP Lovecraft). The band members pronounce the band's name Kah-toulou.

The band records their first demo in 1987, with only a couple of tracks: Otro Cuento and Legiones de Muerte.

They recorded their second demo in 1988 with 3 songs: Testigos, Uno Más y La Soga.

In 1991 they recorded their first LP with the label «Momentos Thráshicos» (Semaphore).

In 1992 they recorded a new demo of 2 songs No Creo En Ti and Vuelve Mañana with which they perfect their sound and prepare for the jump to the rest of the world.

In 1994 Ktulu changed label, S.M.D. Records in association with another, Hardvinyl Records, and released of their second LP Orden Genético (1994).

Ktulu contributed their song "Apocalipsis 25D" to Alex de la Iglesia's movie El Día de la Bestia (1995).

Put on hold in mid-2002 and reactived in late 2003 with Willy K as the only remaining member, searching for new musicians. Played live again for the first time in April, 2007.
