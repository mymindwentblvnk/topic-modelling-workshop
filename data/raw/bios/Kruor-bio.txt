Kruor is a five man death metal band from Kuopio, Finland. The band was formed in year 2005 with Ykä on vocals and guitar, Taskinen on drums and Koponen on bass guitar. Then later Pena joined the band. Soon after joining the band he got kicked out and replaced by Eppu. 

Then Ykä wanted to focus on the vocals, so they looked for a new guitarist and ended up to Juri. Juri joined the band right after recording their first album.

Kruor has released three full-length albums and is currently recording their fourth.
