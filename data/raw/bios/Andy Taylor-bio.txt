Andy Taylor is a guitarist, singer, songwriter and producer, best known as a member of Duran Duran and The Power Station. 

He was born in Cullercoats, England, on February 16, 1961. He already toured Europe when he was in his teens, before he joined Duran Duran in 1980. In 1985 he started The Power Station with bandmate John Taylor, drummer Tony Thompson and singer Robert Palmer. This band reminded him of what he loved most: rock nâ€™ roll. 

He decided to leave the synth pop music of Duran Duran and started a solo career, resulting in the albums Thunder (1986) and Dangerous (1990). In 1996 he reunited with The Power Station to make their second album. 

He reunited with Duran Duran in 2001. In 2006 he departed the band for the second time. Currently he is finishing a new album/project in the UK & France for release later this year.
