Artaius was born in the first months of 2008, aiming to merge metal and folk music. The band has always been wide open to various influences, that led its music to embrace Celtic melodies, modern metal’s groovy riffs and Seventies prog rock’s vintage atmospheres.
After a self-produced EP, in April 2013 the band releases its first full-length album, named "The Fifth Season". The release is followed by an intense live activity on stages such as Temporock (Gualtieri - RE) and Fillmore (Cortemaggiore - PC), along with famous Italian folk metal acts like Draugr, Furor Gallico, Kalevala and Diabula Rasa. The band also joins several open air festivals like Fosch Fest, sharing the stage with Ensiferum and Skyforger among others. On November, 2 the band opens the one and only Italian gig of Arcturus, with No More Fear and Riul Doamnei.
In spring 2014 the band has its first European tour with Vallorch, and in July attends at Machete Fest with Primal Fear and Cayne.
The band has just finished recording their second full-length album - opening their music to a lot of changes in terms of both heaviness and melody. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Artaius">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
