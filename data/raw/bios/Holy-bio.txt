Following in the footsteps of bands like the Flaming Lips and Mercury Rev, the Swedish group never stay in one place for too long. While their sound stretches from peppy garage rock to super-sized dream pop to subaquatic bedroom synth pop, HOLY's recorded output is always melodic on the surface and deeply yearning below no matter the approach.

HOLY is the name Stockholm-based musician Hannes Ferm trades under; his first appearance was on 2014's four-song EP Sliver of Your Heart. It was issued by Krazy Krille Rekords and the mix of ambitious bedroom pop and psych-laden garage punk landed the band a deal with local imprint PNKSLM. 2015's Stabs was the first record HOLY released for the label and it stayed firmly in the garage rock realm. Ferm spent the next few years working on a new, more sprawling and experimental approach that yielded the exploratory, heavily psychedelic follow-up, All These Worlds Are Yours, in January 2018. Not one to stick with a template for long, Ferm swung away from big, blown-out productions led by majestic guitars in favor of synth-driven, more introspective sounds. Working with Jacob Haage, who produced El Perro del Mar's KoKoro, Ferm took his sketches for songs to Haage's studio to bring them fully to life. With a small cast of friends who included Nora Karlsson, the guitarist in HOLY's live band, Ferm crafted a batch of pocket symphonies that took up half the space of the songs on All These Worlds Are Yours, while still containing the same high levels of emotional content. Ryder was issued by PNKSLM in early 2020 <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Holy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
