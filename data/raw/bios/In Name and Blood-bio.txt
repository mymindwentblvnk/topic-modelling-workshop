In Name And Blood

Formed in 2003 under the guise of "TheSetup", In Name And Blood have been at it non stop. Touring nationally, releasing a swag of demos, 7 inches, CD's and polycarbonates just isn't enough for them. 2005 saw the guys back in the studio recording a follow up album to their 2004 self tited debut (Trial & Error) - Dead Water. Described as Mid Youth Crisis meets Iron Maiden, In Name And Blood represent the passion and fervor of mid 90's idealist hardcore with metal and rock'n'roll roots. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/In+Name+and+Blood">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
