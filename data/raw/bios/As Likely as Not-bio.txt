Born in 2009 As Likely As Not grew fast in extreme music, following their natural roots in hardcore and thrash-death metal underground. In 2010 they start recording the first full lenght album mix and mastered in Sweden by Pelle Seather and Goran Finnberg (In Flames, Dark Tranquillity, Arch Enemy, Soilwork and many more...) ! With lots of gigs and festival the band became very popular in the underground and they were contacted from the “The Execution Kollektive” label through Eye Carver management. The 28th march "Stand Up and Nerve" came out in shops and iTunes store, with a promotional video of the song “My Last Confession”.
The first European Tour came on May 2012, in particular in Russia and Ukraine, where they were the headliner band of all shows; at the moment they are getting ready their second European Tour around Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, starting in the next October.
In September 2012 new single “Secrect and Lies” mixed by Logan Mader (Machine Head, Gojira, Soulfly etc) see the light with some changes in the line up of the band.
