Uncle Sid wants to say hi to all our Sidizens who have been so patient waiting for us to get Rockin again! For those who have just became familiar with us, here's a little info. We are a melodic Hard Rock/Metal band with a lot of classic and new day influences. Our music is played with heart-felt dynamics and lots of passion. We are very hyped about our new vocalist Terena Armstrong and our new musical endeavor we are on. Uncle Sid just released our new single "Rock Guru"and we are releasing the full 5 song EP "Rock Guru" in early 2014!

From Uncle Sid's debut gig opening for the iconic Uriah Heep at the Famous Commodore in Vancouver B.C. Canada to the present line-up, we know there's a lot of Rock'n still to do in this World! Uncle Sid makes music because we love making music! Anyone who has seen us live knows that we put our heart and soul into doing the best damn Rock show we can possibly can do!
