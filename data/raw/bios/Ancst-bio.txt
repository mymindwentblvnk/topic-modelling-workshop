Striving from different life-perspectives,
we see ourselves and each other in individual responsibilities to give this entity any sort of significance.
Aware of our beings with all its advantages of modern society, we cannot and won't be able to close our eyes and minds from all this failed concepts we're forced to deal with in our daily bases.
Sick of asking whether these concepts make sense in any way or not.
These are the voices of the unsatisfied.
The marginalised.
We're sick of being flawless and adapted.
Conditioned to follow or to lead.
We have not forgotten to think for ourselves.
Take responsibility for ourselves.
To share and to feel.
This is the wrath of the unassimilated who were forced to participate in this
farce.
We're tired asking the same unanswered questions
and using this collective to create a vent for all the accumulated frustration about democracy, fascists, racists, sexists and all the other fucked up agendas.
Our storm will wash it all away.
Never stop dreaming....

anti-fascist
anti-racist
anti-sexist
anti-religion
