History

As usual, the idea of setting up a band like this came up in a bar, under heavy influence of alcohol. Gentlemen Hyvönen and Korpikoski were the founding members. The actual birth of the band could be calculated to somewhere in summer 2003.

Every member of the IV-squad has had some other musical projects before Infernal Void. In the beginning, Markku Anttila did the vocals, but was later replaced by Miika Kiljala.

In october 2003, a second guitarist joined the band. He didn't seem to fit seamlessy to the IV-squad, so after a month he left from the band.

Before the year 2004 the group's first demo "Brutal War" was recorded 12.-13.12. at studio Watercastle, Jyväskylä. Presenting thrashy, mid-paced death metal the demo has found into the hearts of many metalheads.

In spring 2004 the song "Brutal War" crushed it's opponents in all three rounds of Imperiumi's Eliminaattori with the total of 4843 points and went to Eliminaattori's Hall of Fame.

The future is still uncertain, but Infernal Void is rehearsing new material, and next... who knows?
