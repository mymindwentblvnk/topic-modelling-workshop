Red Gem of Hades is a deathy thrash (or thrashy death) metal project based in the Minneapolis/St. Paul area of the United States.

Red Gem of Hades vocals reflect an aggressive style that is probably best described as a blend Chuck Billy from Testament and Johann Hegg from Amon Amarth. Listeners will hear the strong influence of thrash and death metal rhythms in the guitar work combined with lead work more reminiscent of classic metal masters like Dave Murray (Iron Maiden) and Glenn Tipton (Judas Priest).

The band's lyrical themes center around interpretations of abstract, mythological, historical and personal themes. Red Gem of Hades always strives for the perfect balance of heaviness and musicality.

Current Lineup:  Kyle Vraa - Lead Guitar/Vocals, Pat Young (of Expyre) - Lead Vocals, Nick Warhead (ex- A Call To Arms) - Rhythm Guitar; Ryan "Zeus" Smith (of Expyre) - Drums, & Kayti Decay (ex-Deadzone) - Bass. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Red+Gem+of+Hades">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
