Mecca Normal is an influential two-piece indie rock band from Vancouver, Canada. Formed by Jean Smith and David Lester in 1984, Mecca Normal is considered one of the archetypal, pioneering leaders of the riot grrrl movement. Smith writes lyrics and sings in a style that is often confrontational and laced with feminist themes; Lester's melodic yet dissonant guitar swirls and loops around her vocals. Merging the personal with the political in their songs and art-related activism, they helped define the sound and spirit of the early diy / indie rock / riot grrrl movement alongside bands such as Beat Happening and Bikini Kill. Indeed, they are perhaps the only band to have full-length releases on three of the largest indie labels of the 90s: K Records, Kill Rock Stars and Matador Records. They also had a 7" single released by Sub Pop. In the 80s they formed their own record label, Smarten Up!, which later merged with Lester's small press publishing company Get To The Point to form Smarten Up! And Get To The Point. Both Smith and Lester have authored their own books. Smith also formed 2 Foot Flame with Peter Jefferies and Michael Morley (Dead C). The band released two LPs on Matador Records, 1995's self-titled LP, and 1997's Ultra Drowning.
