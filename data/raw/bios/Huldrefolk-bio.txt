(2003 - 2013)

Huldrefolk was a west-flemish Black Metal band, known for its use of nature, troll, pest and swamp lyrics. Huldrefolk started off as a two-headed Pagan Metal band with founding members Leshyj and Drang. When other people joined the band (Waldschrat and Hammerman), they changed the concept to filthy Black Metal. Huldrefolk had DK Skeletor on bass, also in Wapenspraak & Drinkgelag. Musically they played Black Metal. After a decade in the underground, Huldrefolk's plague-laden mission came to an end in 2013. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Huldrefolk">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
