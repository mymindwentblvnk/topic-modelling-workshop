Hailing from Nice, France, In Other Climes was formed in july 2004. We have known eatch others for years, having been to school together and played in many different bands (Stompage, Neak ta ...), all from the metal hardcore scene. We finally got together after having experienced music seperately. We're influenced by the roots of hardcore as well as the new metal hardcore scene and try to spread a message of ethic, hope and will. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/In+Other+Climes">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
