Guild Of Destruction are bringing back the old school death metal that has been void lately in the music scene. Heavy guitar with screamin’ solos reminiscent of an eagle being slaughtered, gut churning bass filthy like a pig in shit, pure metal drumming with no breaks or slow tempo and the visceral screaming of the talented Meatsword. Guild have played many live shows with bands such as Walk the Earth, The Day Everything Became Nothing, Alarum, Fuck… I’m Dead, Double Dragon (Interstate) and many others. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Guild+of+Destruction">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
