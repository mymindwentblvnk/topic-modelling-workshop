«Truth is, this is a quite glorious first album. Just listen to the magnificent ‘Muted Colours‘ and you will hear shimmering guitars steeped in the New Wave sound, primarily between the years 1979 to 1990. It’s almost as though Johnny Marr has taken over guitar duties in the formerly mentioned Factory band, such is the irresistible, seemingly effortless glow.» - God Is In the T.V.

«The result is mesmerising – it’s intimate – but most of all, it sounds amazing.» - The Bitter Sweet Symphonies
