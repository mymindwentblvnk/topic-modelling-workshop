Fifth to Infinity - Transcendental Metal of Death
"We are antagonists of this so-called "human civilization" and of the monkeys that consecrate its existence. Seeing far beyond the consensus of an objective reality. We depict the multitudes and the non-existant."

Members: 
Jonas Reslan (Vocals, Guitars) - Martin Lopez (Drums) - David Lindh (Bass)

Biography:
Fifth to Infinity was formed by Jonas Reslan, Martin Lopez and Martin Mendez in 1997, after the breakup of the underground black metal outfit Vinterkrig.
The band was set to release its debut album in 2000, but due to a set of unfortunate circumstances, it was all put to rest in 2001 before the completion of the recording. Jonas revived the band in 2007, now with an even darker vision. After reuniting with Lopez in 2008 and recruiting bassist David Lindh as a full-time member in 2013, Fifth to Infinity returned to the studio to work on its upcoming album, coming out this fall.
