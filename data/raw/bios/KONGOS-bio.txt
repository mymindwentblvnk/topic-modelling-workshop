Kongos is a rock band of four brothers - Johnny, Jesse, Dylan and Danny Kongos. Sons of multi-million-seller British singer-songwriter John Kongos, they grew up in London and South Africa, and are now based in Phoenix, AZ, USA.

Written, produced and engineered by themselves, their debut album was released in 2007, receiving glowing reviews and earning a spot on Get Out's top 10 local albums. Later that year, they were named Best Rock Band of Phoenix (Phoenix New Times). Their single In The Music reached No. 9 on South Africa's influential TuksFM top 40. 

Currently recording their second album, Kongos is releasing a single a month -- the first two have been: It's a Good Life and Come With Me Now.

"Kongos sounds like no other band, not just in the Valley, but in the whole of mainstream rock music ..." (Get Out)
 
"Kongos are bound to make it big.  Their songs are radio-ready and they have a frickin' kickin' accordion!" (Music-Critic.com)
