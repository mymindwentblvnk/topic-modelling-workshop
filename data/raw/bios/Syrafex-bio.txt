Syrafex are a sludge metal band from the Isle of Wight. There is disagreement among various sources as to whether they were formed in 2002 or 2003. According to their website the line up currently consists of 'Darren The Baron' (Vocals), 'Mike In Wonderland' (Lead guitar), 'Becky From The Fexy' (Drums), 'Lawerence of Alabia' (Bass) and 'Nick's Bleak Vision' (Vocals). This may not actually be the current line-up, however. Syrafex have released two EP's, 'The Point Between Depression and Insanity' in 2003 and 'The Finest House Brown Piss Water' in 2004. They share, or have shared members with many other island bands, including Overlord (with whom they are most closely related, Darren, Mike and Jess were in both bands), The Ghost of Cato (Formerly PS. I Hate You), Penny's Dropped, Septic Wizard and Arcade Eden. Their live shows are infrequent and involve a relatively unstable line-up of local musicians.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Syrafex">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
