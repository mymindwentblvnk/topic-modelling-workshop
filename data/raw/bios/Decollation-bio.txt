Formed by members of the mighty Liers in Wait, Decollation existed for a short while in the early nineties, releasing one EP on Listenable Records in the same year as Liers in Wait's sole release before dissolving. Though their music was just as complex and labyrinthine as that of the more well-known Liers, their style and atmosphere were quite different. Eschewing Spiritually Uncontrolled Art's insane speed and suffocating atmosphere for longer songs, calmer and more traditionally melodic riffs (relatively speaking, of course: this band certainly did not play melodic death metal in the slightest), and textural enhancement via keyboards, Decollation could be seen as a spiritual continuation of Nocturnus, as well as something of a precursor to bands like Psypheria. 

Oddly, Johan Österberg's vocals had more in common with Cro-Mags-style hardcore than they did with death metal, and Kristian Wåhlin opted for the drummer's seat instead of his familiar guitarist position, perhaps to distinguish this band's sound from Liers in Wait and Grotesque. Tomas Johansson from local heroes Ceremonial Oath rounded out the line-up with his bass-playing. Guitarist John Jeremiah and keyboardist Nick Shields aren't known from any other bands, but they were likely also well-known members of the Gothenburg scene working under pseudonyms, seeing as Kristian, Tomas, and Johan listed their names in the liner sheet as Chris Steele, Charles von Weissenberg, and John Lesley, respectively. Truly a strange and mysterious band in all respects. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Decollation">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
