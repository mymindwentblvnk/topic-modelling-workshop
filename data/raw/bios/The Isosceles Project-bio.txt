The Isosceles Project is a fierce musical force that resides in downtown Toronto, Canada. Since forming in 2007, this instrumental trio has been steadily gaining momentum with their dynamic sensibility for song writing, relentless hunger for the road, and their incredible respect for the riff. Fuelled by their D.I.Y attitude, theyâ€™ve successfully completed two national tours, released a critically acclaimed record, and two live DVDs. 

After re-establishing their line-up in 2009, The Isosceles Project is more capable than ever to make sure that their work ethic is as strong as their desire to play clever, creative, heavy music. 

Expect a 2011 release for their next full length record along with some spring/summer 2011 national touring. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Isosceles+Project">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
