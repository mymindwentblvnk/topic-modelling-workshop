Forming at the turn of the Century Powerhead have continued to please in the tradition of Australian underground heavy rock music. Starting out in a more Rock'n'Roll/Stoner Rock direction influenced by the like of Fu Manchu, Hellacopters and Monster Magnet the sound has developed more deeper and dark touching on The Melvins, Neurosis and Godflesh. But are still not afraid to throw in a little Rock action as well. Its not just about being brutal and heavy but songs and melody.
