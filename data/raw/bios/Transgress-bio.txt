Based in the Loughrea area of Galway. The band was formed in 2005 and and have achieved quite a lot for their age! 
Coming second in the National Final of the Blast: Beat Battle of the Bands competition 2006. Out of a total of about 750 bands and at just 13 years old were by far the youngest band in the competition!
More gigs followed, the most exciting being that of their massive gigs in the Cork Opera House, Black Box theatre Galway.
After that they were chosen to play at the Download Festival in the RDS arena in Dublin by organisers, Aiken Promotions, headlined by Guns n Roses!
They have recorded in the world renowned Grouse Lodge Studios and more recently in RTE's Studio 8!
To date they have played on the same bill as the likes of Guns 'n' Roses, Metallica, A7X, Bullet for my Valentine, Therapy?, Alice in Chains, Lauren Harris, Stone Sour and Acidtone, Alabama 3 to name a few.
The band have made appearances on Dublin regions lmfm and RTE 2fm national radio, and were on RTE 2 Television a number of times! And they are very eager for their brand of Heavy Metal/Thrash to reach even larger audiences!
