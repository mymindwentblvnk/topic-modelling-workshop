Ritual Howls is a three piece band from Detroit, Michigan who formed in February 2012.  This three piece band plays a great style of music that incorporates elements of dark/atmospheric post-punk, no wave, and chill wave style music within their sound.  Ritual Howls utilizes synths and drum machines to give their sound a minimalist industrial vibe, which adds to the coldness of the band's sound.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ritual+Howls">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
