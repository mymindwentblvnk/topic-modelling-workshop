The core members of MINDCAGE — Dietrick Hardwick (guitar), Brian Howell (bass) and Craig Nudo (drums) — have been connected personally and through music for almost thirty years.

With the addition of power vocalist Jeff Hignite, the intense and unique synergy of writing and performing became apparent.

The band will debut OUR OWN DEVICES to the public this September at the ProgPower USA XIV festival in Atlanta, Georgia <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mindcage">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
