Grohot Exitus was formed in the autumn of 2004 in Galati, Romania. The founding members were Adrian Enciu (guitars), Victor Dobrea (vocals and bass) and Radu Matric (drums). Bogdan Tomos later joined the band as the second guitar player, but his activity wasn't to last long. In October 2004, Victor gave up bass, which was took over by Andrei Zala and Bogdan left the band. The last line-up change was made in January 2005, when Elena Ursu joined in as the bass player. 

The original members decided upon a style which draws its essence from the old school black metal. The band's name, standing for Scream and Death, reflects the lyrical theme concerning atheism and the decadence of the human soul struggling in its own debris. The sound, combining blast beats, speed riffs and harsh vocals, stands under the traditional sign of raw black metal defying all modern influences such as melodic and atmospheric passages. 

Since 9th of October 2006, the first audio material, Veacuri Stinse, is available to the public. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Grohot+Exitus">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
