1. An Austrian pop-rock group which was formed in 1973. In 1984 they released Live Is Life which topped the charts in many countries, and a live recording of the song even made the Top 40 in the USA in 1986. It remains popular as a sing-along song for crowds at sports events in Europe. A cover version was also performed by the Slovenian band, Laibach.

Opus is still active, but have not enjoyed the same success since Live Is Life, and are generally considered a one-hit wonder. They also had success with some other songs in Austria, Germany and Switzerland, but not in "non-German-speaking" countries.
The Finnish ice hockey team, Tappara, has the song Live Is Life as it's goal song.

4. An unsigned English Heavy Melodic Instrumental band which formed in 2000. 
Opus formed in early 2001 and debuted a year later with their 6 track (non-instrumental) EP Questions. After a year and a half of touring in and around London and supporting bands such as The Datsuns, Kid Galahad and The blueprint Opus decided to perform an instrumental one off show in their local area Frimley. Much of their set was improvised and the band played their set with total belief in what they were doing that night. From that day Opus have only ever performed instrumental sets.
In 2004 they went on to record their self-titled 30 minute long, one song self-released EP OPUS. They have since gone on to develop their distinctive style of heavy, yet melodic instrumentation and have been working to create new material. Sample Aura is the bands 3rd studio EP and was released on 10th March 2006. They recorded a free track called Antipathy which could be downloaded from their official site.
Their influences can be found in artists such as Tool, Mogwai and King Crimson.
