Hailing from Southern California, Redención (Redemption) is an MC with the ability to express himself fluently in both English and Spanish. This trait has opened many doors for this up-and-coming independent MC. He has been featured in hip hop publications from Spain, Mexico and the U.S. He is a member of the Inland Empire based Urban Poets Crew and a successful graphic artist.

Redención has released 1 mix tape, “L.A. Redencion Mixtape vol.1” (2003); 2 EPs “El Preludio” (2005) and “Redencion EP” (2008); and 1 LP, “Antidepresivo” (2006).

Redemption reclaims hip hop as a poetic art form. Altogether, his music is an amalgam of sounds, styles, textures and trends that make you move, think, reflect, cry, scream, and above all, act.
