Faune is an enigmatic artist (possibly named Claude) who releases solely on the pathmusick netlabel founded by artists Alex Cortex and Decadnids.

The music could be described as cinematic or low key ambient and one might infer that he has a career in professional or academic music composition. Most Faune tracks are based around looping mostly identifiable snippets of jazz or classical music and then applying electronic effects such as filters, delays and reverb. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Faune">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
