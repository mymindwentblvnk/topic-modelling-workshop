At least 16 artists have used the Shadow Man moniker:

1) Shadow Man came to life in 2010 and is a one-man project, consisting of Marvel aka Marcel Offermanns from Germany, playing all instruments and doing the vocals. The intention is to create a sound that is as live as possible, not overproducing, not using samples, not using software to whitewash any recordings. So if you hear some imperfection it's because it was played live. Everything was played as you hear it. Shadow man is not looking for a clean and perfect sound. It must be raw and dirty, leaving room for imperfection. Shadow Man has released 7 albums to date. The last one is Tales of Life, which was released 2013.

2) Shadow Man is a newschool hardcore band with musicians from Cycle and Avail. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Shadow+Man">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
