Airged L'amh is a Greek epic power metal band based in Athens. Originally formed as a school band and under the name "Ragnarok", Alexander Vasilopoulos (guitars) and John Georgopoulos (vocals) created a group that would move in epic/folk fields even with the lyrics based on ancient legends of battles from all around the world. The band started writing songs and soon completed the line up with another guitarist (Michalis Peradinos), a bass player (Gus Makrikostas) and a drummer (George Zoubourlis). With only one change in that line up (George Thanasopoulos taking place behind the drum kit) the band was forced to change the name because two other (internationally known) bands were having the same name. The decision was "Airged Lâ€™amh" (This is Gaelic, in plain English it means "The Silver Arm"). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Airged+L%27amh">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
