For ten years, Travis Morrison  was the lead singer and lyricist of The Dismemberment Plan, the Washington D.C.  art-rock quartet that made hip-hop, R&B, samplers, and having fun safe for the basement-show punk set. The Planâ€™s last two records in particular (Emergency & I, and Change, both released on DeSoto Records) are widely considered to be underground classics.

After releasing the critically-underappreciated solo record Travistan, Travis has moved on and found himself a new band to work with, the Hellfighters, and in 2005 they started working on a new record. After some unsatisfactory attempts to get some songs recorded, the Hellfighters took a break and Travis started singing in local D.C. church choirs, and working for volunteer organizations. In 2006, the band came together again and with the help of ex-Dismemberment Plan member Jason Caddell at the helm, the Hellfighters finished recording the songs that would become All Y'All. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Travis+Morrison+Hellfighters">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
