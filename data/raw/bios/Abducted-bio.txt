Abducted is a Death/Grind band from Groningen, The Netherlands. The band was found during the summer of 2006 by Nico Munnik (vocals), Robbert Lem (guitar), and Merlijn Poolman (drums). After some time Emile Minnaard stepped in as a bass player. Finally, in may 2009 Angelo Zwerwer aka Analfisting Angelo joined the band as a second vocalist.
