Dwellers features  Iota (Small Stone Records) song writer/guitarist/vocalist Joey Toscano, and  Subrosa (Profound Lore) drummer and bassist Zach Hatsis and Dave Jones.  The band originally started as a duo between Hatsis and Toscano, who self-released a 3 song EP in 2009.  A year later, they added Jones on bass, and began writing and performing material for a full length LP.   

In early 2011 Dwellers released a free, experimental EP titled "Peace, and Other Horrors".  The band claims it to be inspired by a single chapter in S.C Gywnne's "Empire of the Summer Moon". The four acoustic songs are Folk and Americana Gothic - with slide guitar, cymbal bows, faucet drips, and eerie vocalizations throughout.    Influences from later Earth, Nick Cave and Warren Ellis' "Proposition" soundtrack, and Dege Legg can all be heard.

The music showcases fuzz-driven psychedelic guitar explorations, while still maintaining a focused and melodic approach to the song writing.  The songs are a bit shorter than the musicians' previous projects, centering around dark blues, layered with influences from 60's psychedelia, rock, folk, and middle-eastern percussion music.   Open tunings, psychedelic slide guitars, vibraphone, and reverb-soaked fuzz can all be found on their debut full length album, which was released by long-standing Detroit label Small Stone Records.
