A Technical Death Metal band hailing from Dhaka,Bangladesh. Chromatic Massacre is the brute force that renegades the simulated conventional and ceremonious concepts and ideologies. The denial of the projected falsification of the ultimate verity forms the philosophical ideology of Chromatic Massacre. Containing fast paced apocalyptic guitar works, devastatingly accelerated blast beats, extremely volatile and colossal bass lines and abyssal growls, Chromatic Massacre is the vigorous statement against the seculer conceptualizations.
