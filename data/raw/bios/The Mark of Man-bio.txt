With 8 Foot Sativa entering a period of indefinite hiatus due to founding member Gary Smith's ongoing injuries, the remaining members had no intention of going into hibernation, and thus left the band forming New Zealand's newest and most exciting metal onslaught 'The Mark of Man'.
 
A modern and unique blend of melodic thrash, full of groove, hooks and unrelenting heaviness, brimming with venom and vitriol. 
'The Mark of Man' represents an expression of rage at the various injustices in the world today... 
"Man's inhumanity to himself and others, human and non-human alike. The path we choose each and everyday, bringing us ever closer to the creation of a true hell on earth."
 
Animal rights is one of the core driving forces of the band, an all-vegan line up united in their desire to unmask the deception that plagues the various animal exploitation industries. 
Metal has always been the most aggressive form of music, hence the perfect vehicle for expressing rage and disgust at exploitation of sentient beings all over the world.

Playing an eclectic style of music influenced by the likes of classic Swedish bands such as At The Gates and Soilwork, to European metal bands Heaven Shall Burn and Gojira and American heavyweights Lamb of God, Killswitch Engage and more, 'The Mark of Man' is here to take a stand and make you listen with their powerful music and message.

Boasting a line up of the cream of the crop in New Zealand metal and hardcore, 'The Mark of Man' is sure to turn heads and captivate the hearts of the current generation of heavy music fans.

'The Mark of Man' features current and ex-members of 8 Foot Sativa, Ulcerate, In Dread Response, Day One and Kill Me Quickly.

Stay tuned for new tour dates and a full length studio album on Deadboy Records in 2010.
