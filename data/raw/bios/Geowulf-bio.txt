Geowulf is Australian duo Star Kendrick and Toma Banjanin.

Originally hailing from the coastal town of Noosa, Australia, Kendrick and Banjanin met in their teens and then moved to Europe, spending their time between London, Berlin, and Gothenburg. The duo started writing together after Kendrick had laid down a few demo vocal tracks and asked Banjanin to flesh them out. The resulting guitar and synth-laden dream pop caught the ear of London-based independent 37 Adventures, who snapped up their debut 2016 single, "Saltwater." At the end of the year, the pair released a second track, "Don't Talk About You."

In 2017, Geowulf issued the singles "Won't Look Back" and "Get You" before collecting them for their debut EP, Relapse, in June. Over the next eight months, the duo focused on touring and recording their debut album, issuing singles like "Hideaway" and "Drink Too Much," both of which appeared on the full-length Great Big Blue in 2018. A year later, after a barrage of singles, the band released their sophomore LP, My Resignation. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Geowulf">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
