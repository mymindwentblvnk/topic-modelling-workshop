Prion is a band from Argentina. 

Their first demo containing 5 songs, it was called "Corpse Dissection" and received a good response in the national underground scene. Some time later, the band suffers a retreat due to some changes on its line up. With this line up: Gregorio Kochian (vocals and guitar), Walter Barrionuevo (bass) and Marcelo Russo (drums).

The band got signed by Orion Music Entertainment and recorded their first full legenth album: "Time of Plagues" in the year 2003. The spirit of Prion is based on creativity and the brutal force of his ripping music guided by direct feelings and intelligent lyrics, feeded by war, pain and a constant embrace with death. Musically, Prion straddled the fine line between thrash and death, with the guitarwork almost black at times. Bands like Carcass, Death and Morbid Angel are a big influence, but Prion are looking for his own sound and style with more eagerly and rage.

In the year 2004, Marcelo Russo is replaced temporarily by Rodrigo Robledo; and the original member Diego Braña left the band. Actually the band line-up is like a trio band and is working with the new future album, that will have an inclination more extreme and technician than the previous record; in the vein of bands like Morbid Angel, Hate Eternal or Immolation.

We are in times of war, hunger, sickness and death. Long and painful ways are waiting for us, where death is invited. The death will walk this way and the way of your heart. So the sound will guide your steps, their sound is Prion´s sound... the authentic power of death metal.
