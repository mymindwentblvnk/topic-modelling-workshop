Morowe is a post-black metal band originally formed 2008 in Katowice, Poland. Rediscovered in the early twenty-first century somewhere in the basement of Upper Silesia. 

Morowe is a deadly breath of melancholy and chaos. Morowe is a devil's breath on your neck.
In case of contact with blood - it burns and infects, when reaches the heart - it kills.
Feeling of coldness and shivering, of fever, sluggishness, pain and dizziness, insanity, shortness of breath, thirst, vomiting and diarrhea (often bloody), cloudy urine that stinks like a horse, insomnia, swelling, and bubo.
Here is Morowe.
