Born and raised in Washington DC, Damu The Fudgemunk has been building a loyal fanbase through his soulful, multi-layered beats, which he crafts using little more than an Akai MPC 2000, a huge record collection and a stack of floppy discs.

Damu is currently one half of the duo Y Society, along with Boston emcee Insight, and he also DJs for the group Panacea

While he's mostly known and respected by his peers for his artistic talents, Damu is also a businessman: He releases his music via Redefinition Records, a label that he personally co-owns and operates. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Damu+The+Fudgemunk">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
