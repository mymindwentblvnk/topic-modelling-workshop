Progressive metal band from Albuquerque, NM formed in 1992 by Gregory Analla and guitarist Dan Rivera.They were joined by drummer Richard Nance, also a New Mexico native. The line-up was completed by bass player Glenn Krause. Seventhsign quickly recorded a highly praised 6-song EP/CD/demo, Blueprint (1993). At this point, Seventhsign was ready to hit the road. They quickly made a name for themselves thanks to countless shows, from small clubs to arenas (where they opened for the likes of Slaughter, Winger, Extreme, Vince Neil, and even Queensryche). Japanese label Alfa signed the band and with producer George Tutko (XYZ, Lita Ford, Journey), they recorded their first album, "Perpetual Destiny" in 1996, on which Rich "Rev" Evans replaced Glen Krause. The European press then discovered Seventhsign at the Foundations Forum and a European deal was soon signed with a German label, InsideOut. Perpetual Destiny was re-released in Europe with a new cover artwork, a new booklet and a bonus track ("Liquified"). After touring across the USA with new bassist Tom Micheals (ex-Ultimatum) , the band then released their second full length album, "Transparent" (US) /"Millennium" (Japan) (1997). Seventhsign unfortunately split in mid-1997. Vocalist Gregg Analla has moved on to sing with Roy Z's Tribe of Gypsies, as well as sang backup on projects by Rob Rock and Bruce Dickinson. Bassist Tom Micheals who left Ultimatum to join Seventhsign, rejoined Ultimatum. and recorded and co-wrote part of their 2001 release "The Mechanics of Perilous Times." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/SeventhSign">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
