Terhen was formed in January 2004 under the name Thamuz. Their origin is Kangasniemi, Finland. They had some disagreements in choosing the music style and there were also some problems with the members at the begining. The band made four songs and in May 2004 they recorded them for rehearsal purposes only. The demo represented their interests in strong black/death metal influences.

After having written some new material Thamuz got the opportunity to make a music clip for a fashion show in Beijing. The show succeeded well and the band was satisfied with using this unusual way of promotion.
In October 2005 a demo called Self Crusifixion MMV containing three songs, which are also included in the debut album, were recorded. Soon after the recording session the drummer left because of lack of time, but he remained in the crew as a lyrics writer. In general the demo achieved good feedback among reviewers and our friends.

They sent a demo to various record companies and to the media and signed a deal with Firebox Records. The band also changed the name to Terhen now.

In 2007 the debut Eyes Unfolded was released through Firedoom Music
