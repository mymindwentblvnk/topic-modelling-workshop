The Green Kingdom is Michael Cottone (born 1976), a graphic designer and sound artist based in Detroit. Primarily self-taught, he started off playing guitar and progressed to a variety of instruments, eventually incorporating digital sound design and production methods.

Interested in creating compositions which blur the lines between soundscape and structure while keeping a sharp focus on melody, his skill is in using a variety of digitally manipulated acoustic and electronic sources, sampled textures, noise and field recordings. Imbued with a sense of “optimistic nostalgia”, his soundworlds encourage introspective explorations and provide an escape from our sometimes hectic lives.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Green+Kingdom">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
