Sarvari is a Hellenic Black Metal project.

'In the year 1999 Granath and Vulpecula, got together to play in one small band in Ancient Olympia. The band was constituted by 5 members with Vulpecula on the bass and Granath behind the drums. However it wasn’t something important and after the split of the band they participated in different bands. Granath participated in 3 black metal bands as a drummer and Vulpecula in a death metal band as a vocalist.

The relationship between Granath and Vulpecula was always excellent and the flame for creating a two man band always existed. Together they walked the paths of Black Metal, influenced by the legends and dark myths of Ancient Greece! The year 2003 was decisive!

Granath decides to withdraw and create the model of SARVARI under the name of WINTER THRONE. He prepares the first songs that were going to be included in the first album. Vulpecula leaves the band in which he was the vocalist and in 2005 Granath invites him to participate in Winter Throne.

In autumn 2005 the private studio (Crypt of Wolf) was created. It was founded under the Holy Mountain of Cronion and doubly by holy waters of Kladeus River. They changed their name in SARVARI and during the winter of 2006 they recorded their first album “Arcadian Nightly Mysteries” which walks in the paths of pagan misanthropic Black Metal was born!

Path To Hate!'
