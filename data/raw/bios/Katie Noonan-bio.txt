Over the last two years Katie Noonan and her new band ‘The Captains’ ( Cameron Deyell – guitar, Stu Hunter – keys/bass, Declan Kelly – drums) have been building a vessel of exciting new songs. 

A return to form for Katie, this band sees the songstress sailing towards a more beloved lush and organic sound with her trademark strong and inspired personal stories. 

Katie has co-written songs with a host of Anzac luminaries including Tim Finn, Don Walker, Sia Furler, Josh Pyke, Tom Shapcott and her fellow ‘Captains’ band mates. 

Katie and the band have been berthing a series of underground warehouse gigs around Sydney to test the waters and warm up the tunes live. Stay tuned to Katie’s myspace and facebook for regular updates/new demoes/gig footage etc and for a glimpse of what promises to be an inspired voyage. 

“ I haven’t felt this positive about my music since the george days… I feel like I have finally found the right musical partners to make my music with again. I am really inspired and excited about this new record – I can’t wait to make it and tour it.” 

Katie Noonan and the Captains are making this record Oct-Nov this year with International Producer/Engineer Nick Didia - with a planned Ep release February 2010 and an April 2010 Album release.
