ADR is Aaron David Ross: Brooklyn resident, multimedia artist, one half of Giallo-crusaders Gatekeeper (Merok) and member of avant-boyband HD Boyz.

The album Chunky Monkey (2013) is “a sound for shopping malls and/or space stations; a shark-eyed jest downloaded from the fractured fizz of New Consumerism.” His debut 8 track mini LP Solitary Pursuits (2011) is a burning head-trip into electronic swamplands packed with science-fiction sonics.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/ADR">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
