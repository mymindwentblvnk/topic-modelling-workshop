The Cloven are a metal band from Monterey, California.

Started in January 2009, The Cloven filled a musical vacuum in the lives of its founding members, Mattie Mauthes, Matt Gin, and Ander Schenck. Eager to begin writing, Ander having just purchased a e-drum-kit, The Cloven began to stay up for nights at a time, tracking demos and ideas as they came. The quality of these demos suffered considerably from a lack of practice, equipment, and sleep. However, it wasn't all for nothing, and the music, though later discarded by the band, helped them form a sound and made need for a new member.

Matt Gin knew of a guitarist who was willing to play for the band. Ander had seen him: Dream Theater hoodie, long hair; he fit the bill perfectly.
Undoubtedly he looked the part, and as Monterey has something like negative 500 metal heads in it, he was given a chance. Though there was initial skepticism from the band, Riley Madden has now proven to be the band's strongest member, a force both in the practice room and in the studio. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Cloven">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
