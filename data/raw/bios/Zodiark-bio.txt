Zodiark is a heavy, melodic and progressive metal project, hailing from Reading,UK. Forming as a band in early 2008, old school pals Simon Robins, Christian Sturgess entered Simon's home studio in the summer to record some demos before writing and recording an album's worth of brutal, yet melodic heavy metal with progressive overtones over the next year... After some well-received instrumental mixes of these songs in late 2009/early 2010, Kurt Jones (ex Nya) and Matt Kaye (ex Biolith) joined as vocalist and drummer respectively in mid 2010. Their self -produced debut album Thoughtforms was released in December 2010 and Zodiark plan to gig in early 2011 with a full UK tour in the summer.
