The first line up was with Galoiæ Darko (drums), Novak Neven (lead guitar), Klapaæ Tomislav (rithm guitar) and Puk¹iæ Alex (bass guitar), in a band called "Cranium". But after a short while, Klapaæ Tomislav was replaced by a guitar player named Haðar Nikola and the band's name was changed into "Ex Catherda". After a year, Neven and Nikola decided to leave the band. That was the point where everything has stopped, so Darko and Alex where the only ones left to continue. In the summer of 2004, Mezak Marko (lead/rhythm guitar) joined the band and Alex changed his role in the band by switching from bass guitar onto the lead/rhythm guitar and the band's name was once again changed into "Burning Legions". After two years of rehearsaling, working on their own material and lots of empty bottles, Burning Legions recorded their first demo CD, with 3 songs on it, titled, "Here We Come Motherfuckers !!!" and soon after that, found their fourth and missing member, Rogina Luka (bass guitar). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Burning+Legions">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
