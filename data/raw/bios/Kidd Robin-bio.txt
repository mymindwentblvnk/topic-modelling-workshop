These guys were a Christian metal band that were active in the late 80s to early 90s I grew up in the same neighborhood as the lead guitarist, Lee Houk in Spokane Valley, Washington. He was a little older than me and introduced me to lots of great 80s metal and hard rock from Kiss to Rush, Judas Priest, AC/DC, Scorpions, and Yingvey Malmstein!  Pretty much was my musical mentor between the ages of 10 and 14. One of Lee's greatest influences was Randy Rhodes and he could really shred by the time he was 15 or so. Not really sure how he went from Ozzy to Christ, but it must've been a positive change for him. Lee was really gifted with electronics, too and was always building guitars, amps, speakers, etc. in his basement. He was a damn fine BMXer, as well. Anyone remember Rampar bikes? That's all he rode. He could bunny-hop a garbage can with one of those tanks, no lie!
Lee could rip and the singer Robin sounded a lot like Queensryche's Geoff Tate. Remarkably so. The band played around the area for a while, put out a CD titled The Inevitable Return Of The Dinosaur Monster (which I still have), and then quickly faded into obscurity. Pretty sure they blamed the grunge phenomenon for that (listen to "Flannel Shirt"). I imagine Lee still plays awesome guitar in some band somewhere. Just hope it ain't country ;) <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kidd+Robin">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
