Ettenmoor was formed in July 2012 by Paweł Mazurkiewicz(vocalist), Grzegorz Wasilewski (guitarist), Julia Olczak (drums) and Michał Kociak (bass). Since then a lot have changed. Our style has matured, we managed to keep the desire to go forward and we have different drummer, bassist and guitarist. Lyrics deal mostly with battles and Norse mythos. Stage debut was on 23rd February 2015 in Bunkier club in Gdańsk. Since then we shared stage with band like Percival Schuttenbach or Sinsinate. We have recorded one miniLP so far in Shargaroth Studio in Gdynia, called "Brothers in Blood".
Current line-up is following: Paweł Mazurkiewicz (vocals), Grzegorz Wasilewski (guitar), Dominik Szumny (guitar), Piotr Jankowski (bass guitar), Tomasz Oleszek (drums) and we’re here to kick ass and chew Viking gum.

"Brothers in Blood" album is available on Spotify, Deezer, TIDAL, iTunes Store, Apple Music and Google Play.
