There is more than one band named Thrall.

1 - Formed in 1995 from the twisted wreckage that was the God Bullies comes Thrall to forge a more perfect union. Thrall create a soundtrack filled with apocalyptic images, diseased minds and bizarre characters living out classic struggles of power, paranoia, madness and rage.

Mike Hard, former frontman for the infamous God Bullies and Hand Over Head, originally formed Thrall with Karen Neal on bass (Inside Out) (not in current line-up), drummer Scott Kodrik (Hand Over Head), guitarists Paul Thor (Hand Over Head) and lead guitarist Kevin Hagen (Enemy Squad). The end result? The sum of all their parts equals a heavy riff-based rhythm section and a furious guitar squall that merge with Mike Hard's disturbingly unhinged vocals creating the unholiest marriage of them all.

Lead Guitarist Kevin Hagen passed away on April, 2010. He is greatly remembered for his contributions to the Thrall cannon.

2 - The Tasmanian Black Metal band Thrall was formerly known as Thy Plagues. The band began in the tradition of primitive solo Black Metal (i.e. Ildjarn, Leviathan, Burzum etc…). With the addition of a bass player in 2006 the project became a duo. In 2009 Em Støy shifted from bass to drums. Thrall has evolved from a primitive droning blast-ridden style to a more groove-laden hypnotic sound fusing Black Metal with Doom influences.

In June 2010, Thrall released their debut full-length, Away From the Haunts of Men on Total Holocaust Records.

In November 2011, the second album "Vermin To The Earth" was released on Moribund Records (Worldwide) and Obsidian Records (Australia and New Zealand)
