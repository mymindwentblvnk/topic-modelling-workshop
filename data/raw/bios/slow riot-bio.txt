Slow Riot is a new three-piece indie rock band from Limerick in the west of Ireland.

Their first track Cooper’s Dream, dropped on Soundcloud in 2013, heavily referenced Twin Peaks which is always a winner.

One of our favourite songs of last year we’ve been looking forward to hearing more from Slow Riot for months with some trepidation.

We’re happy to report that their new track Demons, which precedes an EP to be released in June 2014, is another excellent take on contemporary coldwave, essentially a reworking of Joy Division‘s sound that’s backed up by talent.  All brooding, dark and bass-heavy with an appropriately glum live performance video the forthcoming EP is one to watch. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/slow+riot">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
