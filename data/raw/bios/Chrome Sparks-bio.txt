Chrome Sparks is the project of Jeremy Malvin, a musician and producer living in Brooklyn by way of Pittsburgh and Ann Arbor.  With a background in classical percussion, Jeremy combines his love for synthesizers, beat music, and dance music into a unique blend. 

Just before he started studying percussion at University of Michigan, Jeremy bought a pair of Technics 1200s on craigslist.  Once in school, he lied and told people he could DJ, and after a few months of spinning house party after house party, that became true.  The next summer, he was one of the finalists in the Lollapalooza DJ competition (as Professor Purple), which inspired him to take his DJing more seriously.  During his second year at U of M, he started a weekly house music night at a local club, which grew to bring in artists such as Rusko, Avicii, Wolfgang Gartner, Martin Solveig, and Laidback Luke.  Once touring opportunities in bands started to interfere with his percussion studies, he left school and toured extensively as the drummer for Stepdad, while also playing tours in Miniature Tigers and Rich Aucoin.

Chrome Sparks' music first garnered attention online at the end of 2010 with his bandcamp-released single, "I'll Be Wait For Sadness Comes Along".  The next summer, he released the EP "My <3", which enlisted the help of Los Angeles based vocalist, Steffaloo on a couple of the tracks.  Since then, Jeremy has released a few singles including some with Steffaloo.

Now that Malvin has relocated to Brooklyn, he plans on assembling a group to bring his music to life as a live realization.  He is also planning on releasing another EP in the not too distant future.
