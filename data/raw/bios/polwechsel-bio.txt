Polwechsel formed in 1993, an all Austrian quartet - with trombonist Radu Malfatti. When he left in 1997, John Butcher joined them to record Polwechsel 2. The group has worked with compositions, improvisation and the ambiguity of these methods - and performed in Germany, Austria, Poland, Italy, USA and Canada. In 2002/3 they recorded (Wrapped Islands) and toured with laptop player and guitarist Christian Fennez.
