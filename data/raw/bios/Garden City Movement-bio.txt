Tel Aviv based Garden City Movement is a top notch electronic music project consisting of Joe and Roi formerly part of "Lorena B". They've performed with Disclosure, Bondax, Blonde Redhead and Apparat to name a few. Johnny, the third member, is a well known music journalist, radio DJ and nightlife persona who has played alongside artists such as Floating Points, Koreless, Oneman and many more. Together, the three produce a blend of perfectly beautiful mixes drawn from their diverse cultural worlds. The result ranges from sweet hypnotic beats to ground floor based tracks.

Their second EP is due to be released this spring followed by a European tour and support shows for Cults, Sohn and their debut Boiler Room live performance.
