FANCHON is an alternative rock band infused with grunge and dream pop influences.

Beginning as a solo project by Fanchon, with a focus on poetry based lyrics that reflect her childhood spent travelling around Europe; the band was completed by the addition of Frazer, Ewan and Jacob. They are now gigging around London and reconstructing a heavier sound. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/FANCHON">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
