THE PROFANE is a band formed in July, 2003 by the Arriola brothers, David and Marcelo, who were also founding members of the legendary Paraguayan death metal band SLOW AGONY.

With a unique musical style, THE PROFANE quickly managed to establish themselves as one of the main bands in the Paraguayan underground scene. Their music could be described as a blend of extreme metal, hardcore, punk and rock'n'roll.

THE PROFANE define their style as Death'N'Roll, an expression which includes, in one single term, the rhythmical subtlety of rock'n'roll and the brutal power and aggressiveness of extreme metal.

In February, 2004, the band released its first MCD, titled “Death'N'Roll From Hell”, released on COVENANT PRODUCTIONS, an independent record label, owned by the band.

In March, 2007, THE PROFANE releases its long awaited CD, titled “Chaosbreed”, on the Colombian label HateWorks. The album, which includes 11 tracks of the best and most powerful Death'N'Roll, was completely produced by Marcelo Arriola and Rolando Obregón in COVENANT PRODUCTIONS, and masterized in PLATINUM STUDIOS, in the United States.

The group originally had some outstanding musicians and friends among their members (Víctor Sarria, Sebastian Lema, Eulo Garcia, Sebastian Centurión). The current THE PROFANE line-up is formed by David Arriola (lead vocal), Marcelo Arriola (drums), Diego Arriola (bass), and  Julio Peralta (guitar).
