Deap Vally are a rock duo formed in Los Angeles, California, USA in 2011. The group consists of Lindsey Troy (guitar, vocals) and Julie Edwards (drums). In the heart of Silver Lake, California, Edwards met Troy at a needlework class. They bonded over their love of music, specifically the blues and hence, Deap Vally was formed.
Over the past year, the girls' live demos and videos have circulated online. Deap Vally officially released their debut single, 'Gonna Make My Own Money', on Ark Recordings on July 30th, 2012. 'Gonna Make My Own Money' received an overwhelming positive response in both the U.S. and the U.K. They played their first London show at the Old Blue Last pub and venue in early July, where several other bands have made their mark. They have also landed spots at music festivals such as Hyde Park with Iggy Pop in London, United Kingdom, Latitude Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk, United Kingdom, and are set to play Reading and Leeds Festival in late August[when?]. Their live shows draw similar comparisons to Dan Auerbach and Patrick Carney of The Black Keys, as well as guitar blues influences from Jack White.
Deap Vally will close out the 2012 year with a debut performance in Japan in November, where they will share the stage with the likes of Thurston Moore and Dinosaur Jr., among others.
Deap Vally's debut album will be released under Island Records / Communion in 2013. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Deap+Vally">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
