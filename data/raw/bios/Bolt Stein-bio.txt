Bolt Stein is a Death Metal/Grindcore band from Japan  (Yamagata).

They formed in 1998 and play Bolt Thrower influenced grindcore that sounds as if Napalm Death’s “Scum" had collided with Bolt Thrower’s “Realms Of Chaos". Plenty of blast beats, low-end guttural vocals, and punishing death metal riffs.

They have released 3 split albums. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bolt+Stein">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
