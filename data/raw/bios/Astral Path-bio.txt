Astral Path is a black metal duo consisting of members Justin Bourdeau (guitars, vocals, drums) and Ana Dujakovic (synth, bass). 

After extensively discussing various black metal sub-genres and bands we liked, we decided to begin collaborating musically, despite living in different areas of Canada (Ottawa and Halifax). We have created what we feel is atmospheric/ambient black metal that is overall inspired by our natural world, as well as the cosmos. 

Astral Path is also influenced by some of our favorite bands, such as: Drudkh, Wolves in the Throne Room, Chaos Moon, Midnight Odyssey, Lustre, Spectral Lore, Mare Cognitum, Woods of Desolation, Basarabian Hills, Ash Borer, Krallice, and more. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Astral+Path">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
