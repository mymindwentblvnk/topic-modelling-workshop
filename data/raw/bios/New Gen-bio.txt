'New Gen' started out as a playlist series curated by Caroline Simionescu-Marin, editor at GRM Daily and now an A&R at XL. Working with the label, she expanded the idea into an album project centred around the New Gen Studio, a space for MCs, songwriters, mixers and engineers to collaborate. With artists like 67, Ray BLK, AJ Tracey, Nines and Avelino working in the same studio. The first single extracted from the album, ‘Ring The Alarm’, featuring Tiggs Da Author and Tottenham MC Avelino. Other artists cited by the label include Bonkaz, Kojey Radical, J Hus and Chip. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/New+Gen">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
