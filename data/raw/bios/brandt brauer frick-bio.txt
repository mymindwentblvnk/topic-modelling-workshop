Contemporary classical music melts with house and techno

Three young musicians have recently joined together for this exciting acoustic techno project. On the one hand Daniel Brandt and Jan Brauer, who as a duo named Scott produce club music with a jazz attitude (EPs on My Best Friend, Fluid Ounce, THE GYM and more).

On the other hand Paul Frick, who has studied classical and modern composition with Friedrich Goldmann at Universität der Künste Berlin. Besides experimental pieces for orchestral instruments he also releases house music (EPs on Kalk Pets, THE GYM, 30porumalinha and more).

With prepared piano, vibraphone, drums, various percussions, brass and string instruments, rhodes, bass guitar and analogue synthesizers the trio creates textures that may bring to mind Steve Reich as well as the oldschool loop techno. Experiment meets deepness, complexity meets minimalism. The generation of the sound is mostly acoustic – even the bassdrum. Only few electronic instruments complete the sound.

Brandt Brauer Frick succeed in a thrilling synthesis of club and concert hall. On both platforms they will present themselves, getting percussive and energetic sounds out of apparently harmless classical instruments.

The trios first EP "Iron Man" has appeared in August 2009. The EPs „Wallah/Button“ (The Gym) and "Bop/Paino Shakur" (Tartelet Records) will be released in November and December. The full length debut album will follow in February on Tartelet Records. Also on the way: acoustic reworks for Bozeman (Doppelschall) and Emika (Ninja Tune).  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Brandt+Brauer+Frick">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
