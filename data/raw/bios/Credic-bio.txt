Credic is more than just a name. More than just a band. The neologism stands for a band of brothers, for Death Metal that couldn‘t be more versatile. More dynamic. Ferociously fast or menacingly slow, stomping or monumental, filigree and melodic yet utterly brutal, full of zeitgeist yet old-school in its habitus. Make no mistake: This Stuttgart gang knows all too well about variety being their fiercest weapon – and they are more than eager to play their trump cards in their impressive live stampede. You have been warned. A new force is rising.
