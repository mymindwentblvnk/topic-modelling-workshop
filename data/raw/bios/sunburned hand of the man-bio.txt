Sunburned Hand of the Man is an experimental band from Massachusetts that formed in 1997 from the remnants of the Boston psychedelic punk trio Shit Spangled Banner.

Sunburned Hand of the Man has an amorphous lineup, with composition and instrumentation potentially varying from gig to gig. Their work is improvisational within a structured framework, so no two performances of a piece are identical--they may not even have the same title--but the piece evolves and each version may be seen as a growth from the prior version.

They release records on the Eclipse Records label, as well as a number of smaller labels, and produce a great number of limited edition albums on CD-R via their own Manhand label. In 2005 the band toured the United States to play Arthurfest in Los Angeles with Magik Markers. Many regard Sunburned Hand of the Man as contributors to the New Weird America folk revival. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sunburned+Hand+of+the+Man">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
