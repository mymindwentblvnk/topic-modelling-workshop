In Death I Become was founded in 2003 from the ashes of Wyoming NSBM outfit Brumalis, after several members moved to Lynchburg, VA. Their early works fell into the Gothic/Doom metal category, however, later works show more of a Black/Death metal style. Lyrics involve primarily Germanic heathen themes and esoteric occultism. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/In+Death+I+Become">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
