Though more widely known for the 'dub techno' music released under the name bvdub, Brock Van Wey began releasing material under his given name in 2009. These works continue Brock's (beginning with his recent releases under bvdub) movement into more ambient territories.

The first album recorded under his own name is "White Clouds Drift On And On". Jacob Arnolds (of Gridface) said of this 2xCD that "listening to it straight through, I’m reminded of the good old days when synthesizers offered glimpses of an alien world, when bedroom producers created whole atmospheres in space and time. Sometimes you need to look back to move forward. It’s a revival."

The first disc is Brock's album, and the second is a full length interpretation by Intrusion. Released on echospace [detroit] in June of 2009, it has received rave reviews from Boomkat, Smallfish & Gridface. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Brock+Van+Wey">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
