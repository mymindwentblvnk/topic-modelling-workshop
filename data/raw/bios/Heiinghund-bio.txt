This is a solo project from Heiinghund from legendary Sort Vokter. First releasing only 2 songs but later also a album with the same name. Heiinghund draws inspiration from the tall mountains and majestic nature bathed in the Northern Light of northern Norway. In the wintertime it is dark, only a few hours of dim light in the middle of the day. If you listen you`ll hear this darkness in the music, only lit up by the Northern Light and the moon. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Heiinghund">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
