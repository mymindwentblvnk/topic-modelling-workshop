Chicago area guitarist Kevin M. Buck's first album, Initiation, is a collection of the songs that have haunted Buck for the past ten years. These songs were inspired by melodies heard in dreams and meditations. Initiation displays the incredible guitar style that dwells within Buck's ethereal, and sometimes devastating, compositions. The heavy metal and hard rock blend is reminiscent of early Rising Force in its sonic impact, with plenty of incendiary licks and riffs. Initiation was recorded at Linder Ave. Recording Studios and released independently on Osiris Records. Buck's future plans include more recording and touring, and he hopes to have support from a major label. In a live setting, Buck plays original music from his album Initiation, as well as carefully hand-selected cover songs. The current line up features Tommy Salzburg (formerly of Metal Blade recording artists Tattoo) on drums, Eric Pine on the six string bass guitar and Kevin M. Buck on guitar, mandolin, keys, and vocals. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kevin+M.+Buck">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
