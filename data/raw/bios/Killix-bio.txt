Killix is a metal group from Los Angeles with a thirst for rage. Along with gigging frequently throughout Southern California, the band has several tours under their belts. With the coming of a second self-released album, none can foresee what may lie ahead, "along on the Path of Chaos." Line up: Warren J Williams
