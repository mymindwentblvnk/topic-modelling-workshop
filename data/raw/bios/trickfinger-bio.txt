Trickfinger  is the alter ego of John Frusciante, used for his experimental music made of samples and, as of 2015, for his acid house releases.

The first recording under the Trickfinger moniker that has been released is the "Sect In Sgt" single which can be downloaded for free on Neurotic Yell Records' bandcamp page: http://neuroticyellrecords.bandcamp.com/album/sect-in-sgt

Frusciante talked about this release in his 2014 Guitar Player interview and explained how the combination of samples came to him in a dream and that he knew he would be able to do anything once he completes the track he dreamed of.

In April, 2015, Frusciante released his first album under the alias of Trickfinger. The album of the same name is Frusciante's first experimenting with the acid house genre. On September 8, 2017, Trickfinger released the second part of the recordings made during the winter of 2007 on the album called Trickfinger II on the label Acid Test. All the music was recorded live onto a CD burner, through a cheap mixer. John would sit on a chair, in his living room, surrounded by five to 15 machines, and just keep programming and jamming until the track was ready to be recorded. There were no overdubs â€“ recorded all live.

On March 29, 2020, he released four track albumLook Down, See Us on the experimental electronic label Evar Records, which is owned and operated by him (Trickfinger) and Aura T-09. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Trickfinger">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
