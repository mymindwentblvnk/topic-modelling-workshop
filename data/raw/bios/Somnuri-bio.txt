Drawn out of a unique, creative vision and driven by a deep passion for all things heavy, Somnuri aren’t your typical Brooklyn sludge metal band. While fans of High On Fire, Mastodon, Kvelertak, Baroness, Kvelertak and Torche may fall in love, Somnuri bring so much more to the table than the mere sum of their parts; shying away from tropes and committing instead to a determined, iconoclastic approach. Musical liberation is on full display when it comes to their breakneck energy, infectious melodies and slow-burning aggression, a cacophony of bludgeoning riffs and pounding grooves. Embodying Somnuri’s refusal to concede or compromise, the music they create is a reflection of their startling talent and undeniable ethic, a devastating musical worldview ready for those willing to inhabit it with them. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Somnuri">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
