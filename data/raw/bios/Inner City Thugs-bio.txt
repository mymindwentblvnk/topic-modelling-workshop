Inner City Thugs is a three member group from Eufaula, Oklahoma.There style includes hardcore Rap, smooth Westcoast with a R&B feel, to Eastcoast with a Jazzy edge. With the groups Leader,"D-BO", you hear an aggressive execution of the lyrics, similar to Rap-A-Lots "Scarface". Jamal gives you the same energy level but at a higher pitch ,which is a very good contrast when listening from one verse to the next. With Samaria you get strong rap lyrics and R&B style singing with strong harmony.

D-BO put this very Powerful trio together in 1996 and produced the groups first album "Creepin The Bakkk Streets" distributed on "Across the Traxx Records ". After doing regional performances and promotion of their first album , they were ready to purchase their own recording studio and focus much more time on a second album. Now that the pressure of an hourly studio rate was eliminated ,the group was able to get much more involved with the production process of their music.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Inner+City+Thugs">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
