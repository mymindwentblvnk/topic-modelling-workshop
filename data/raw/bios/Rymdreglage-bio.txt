Rymdreglage was formed in 2003 by Daniel Larsson and Tomas Redigh. After they spent high school together, then as DJ Baba and Flyingpickles (bad musical rivals) decided the two youths suddenly to join in a common band. Why then, one might wonder? What would Flyingpickles able to bring the notorious Dj: Baba who had previously played at Mossbrott both one and two times. Flyingpickles or Tomas as he really called claimed that he certainly could sing if all the external conditions were favorable.
It was just to find a moderately cool place with perfect sound reproduction and a light that induced a sort of light shimmer on the walls that made the soul 100% quiet and so was able to free it self from all the inner voices who told it that he couldn’t sing. 
Now it turned out that these external conditions were as close to utopia as one can get in modern times. That’s the reason why all materials are released as instrumental versions.
