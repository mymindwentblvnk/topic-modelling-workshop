DOG HEAD started with a simple intention, create powerful music that ignites angst and makes you want to pump your fist in the air! Their sound is aggressive, combining the dark techno elements of industrial music with anger driven, high-speed thrash metal guitar riffs.

DOG HEAD is known for dragging some of the weirdest shit you’ve ever seen on stage with them, including actual animal skulls, a piñata of Earth filled with candy and condoms that gets busted over the crowd, various other indescribable props and theatrics, and jack-o-lanterns that ended up splattered on the stage.

DOG HEAD now has their most intense lineup yet, thanks to new front man Jason Lodge and original members Martin Fischer (guitar/vocals) and Gene Seybold (bass/electronica). DOG HEAD is currently writing and recording powerful new music that is getting a lot of praise across the web, along with  booking shows that will guarantee hostile reactions from local churches! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dog+Head">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
