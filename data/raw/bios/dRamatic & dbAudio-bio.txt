dRamatic & dbAudio are producers and dj’s based in Nottingham, England who have both been involved in the drum n bass scene since the early 90’s. The last two years has seen them join forces and focus on production enabling them to bring together their strengths and harness a workflow and process that
is so hard to capture as a solo artist. Developing a unique style and consistency has been the strategy which has been recognized and nicely summarized in an ATM magazine interview with Nookie of Phuzion Records. 
“These guys are really starting to come through now. They’re growing all the time, they’re one of the only new producers around who can do deep, musical tracks but still work on the dancefloor”.

Their music has received growing support from key people within the scene such as
Ltj Bukem, Grooverider, Fabio, Bryan Gee, Nookie, Marky, Big Bud, Random Movement, Lenzman, Adam F, London Electricity, Furney, Bailey & Makoto to name but a few.
Having signings from labels such as Good Looking, Liquid V, Mars, Phuzion, Soundtrax, Innerground, Ingredients, Telluric and Creative Source the future should be exciting for these guys. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/dRamatic+&+dbAudio">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
