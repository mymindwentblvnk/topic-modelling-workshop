Crimson Milk is an American death metal act that began with a comedy-based focus but has since evolved into a serious project with a significantly darker direction.

After a series of unreleased demos, the band's first album "The Milky Way" was released in 2010. A follow-up EP titled "Dienasty" is expected soon and will debut the artist's new focus and shift from melo-death to blackened death metal. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Crimson+Milk">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
