It all began in 2004. Anton and Ints were looking for a drummer and a guitar player to form a new band. after some searching, Kaido and Priit agreed to join the forces. As did Aimar and the project was all set up.

Rehearsing and composing took a hell of a time. Some minor appearances at local clubs gave the needed push to take it even further. What once was hard seemed primitive and had to be taken to the next level - to the studio. The 3 song EP was the bands second session in the studio, following the demo recording of Backfire.

Soon after that it became clear that Kaido must head to finland permanently. In 2008 the band decided to record an album which will be released very soon. After the recording Kaido left and so did Priit to move on with his own musical ideas.

Soon after that a new drummer was wound - Argo. Aimar filled the gap by switching to guitar. A new vocalist Habe joined as well and the band was complete again.
