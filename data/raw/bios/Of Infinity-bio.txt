Of Infinity was conceptualized and born in 1999 by founding members, guitarist Nazareth Sando and vocalist/synthasist Alessandra Zinicola.  Living hundreds of miles apart, Nazareth and Alessandra began flying cross the US between New Jersey and Arkansas to develop them selves and their music.  Their quest for adept band members has taken them on all sides of the country with notable stops in Pennsylvania, Arkansas, New Jersey, and Utah.  The band has since settled in San Antonio, Texas where they acquired new drummer, Carlos Teller. The band writes, records, and plays music that is as intense and beautiful as can be created.  Described as heavy, gothic, doom, progressive, and melodic, and likened to such bands as Lacuna Coil, Evanescence, Nightwish, and Theatre Of Tragedy, Of Infinity is appealing to fans of all styles of metal and hard rock.  With an uncompromising drive, Of Infinity continues to bring into being breathtaking metal…metal that’s powerful, metal that’s melodic, metal that’s dark…the metal Of Infinity.
