Alternative pop/rock quintet Dig formed in Los Angeles in early 1991, with vocalist/guitarist Scott Hackwith (a producer who worked for the Ramones), guitarist Dix Denney (ex-Weirdos and Thelonious Monster), guitarist Jon Morris, bassist Phil Friedmann, and drummer Matt Tecu. The single Believe spent almost three months in MTV's Buzz Bin, and prompted the release of Dig's second album, Defenders of the Universe in mid-1996.
