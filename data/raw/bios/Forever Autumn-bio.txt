Acoustic Doom that haunts the hills of Co. Berkshyre, Vinland. Forever Autumn has been the creative endeavors of Autumn Ni Dubhghaill for many many years.  Her early works have cast roots deep into the Underground European Doom Scene, from Ireland to Norway, compilations in Poland and radio play in Sibera.  Drawing from Doom Metal as well as the various folk musique of Northern Europe and the Native Americans.  She sings, she screams, she howls and chants! and the Spirit World dances!! After the release of the first full-length studio album, Waiting for Öktober, Forever Autumn began to perform more, accruing a small but loyal following across the Nine Worlds, from Pow-wows, to concert halls, mountain tops and art galleries, one would think she's done it all.  Forever Autumn continues to perform and create, with a new record on the way.
