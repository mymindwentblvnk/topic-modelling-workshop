There have been multiple acts named Tiger, including a late 80s/early 90s reggae dancehall DJ, a 90s indie/Britpop band, a hardcore punk band, a Japanese female vocalist and a Trinidadian calypso singer popular in the 1930s.

Tiger was a very competent UK blues/rock outfit put together by guitarists Big Jim Sullivan and Les Walker, together with vocalist Nicky Moore, keyboard player Dave McCrae, drummer Billy Rankin, and bass player Phil Curtis. Dave McCrae later was replaced by Alan Park, previously with Beggar's Opera. Tiger split in 1977 after recording three albums.

Yuh Dead Now, Cool Me Down and No Wanga Gut are tracks by the former. He was known for his original 'growling' style of chatting and was popular on the sound system Blackstar and many stageshows in Jamaica, before a motorcycle accident cut his aspiring career short in 1994, sparing his life but not his vocal chords.

The indie/Britpop Tiger recorded songs such as Friends, My Puppet Pal, Race and Shining In The Wood, all heavily played by Mark Radcliffe circa 1996. The band also sported unfashionably long hair at the back of their heads (often erroneously described as mullets), skinny jeans and metal t-shirts - a look much derided at the time but adopted a few years later by East London hipsters.

The hardcore Tiger, formed in 2006 in Traverse City, are set to release an album on Truth & Justice Records.
