There was a demo "From Chaos To Disorder", which was self-released in 2004. Then a record deal was signed with Not Like Most Records. The tracklist of the demo was slightly changed, the tracks were mastered for the factory production of the cd (which has slightly affected the sound) and a split-cd (NLM 004) with FIGHTBACK called "Educated Scum vs. Fightback" was issued. Here is the cover: http://deathgrind.ru/gallery/big_2481.gif
