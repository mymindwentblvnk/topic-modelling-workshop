Those Northern winds are blowin' again from Helsinki, Finland. 

Introducing...The Broken Sun... 

~ Sigma ~ Growling and screaming his way through poignant lyrics and aural melodies, Sigma draws us through each emotion revealed in every song. Bet you can't make it through one song without letting out a growl of empathy...Sigma also brings us the screaming guitar riffs in the Broken Sun arsenal...

~ Mike ~ Provides us the underlying power bass groove and background vocals of The Broken Sun.

~ Joona ~ aka Johnny ~ Pulverizing the skins with the driving beat that powers The Broken Sun, Joona has returned to this powerhouse trio.

Formed in the spring of 2006 by Sigma, Niko Korhonen and Joona Kiukkonen, they were originally called Sea of Love. In September 2006 Niko left the band and Pauli Visuri joined on bass. The band changed to The Broken Sun and after a few shows they went into the studio to record some songs. November 2006 saw the release of the demo Come Alive. Shortly there after, Pauli left the band for personal reasons. December 2006 brought them Mike Nordman on bass and back into the studio to work on their first album. September 2007 The Beginning of the Bitter End is completed and Joona was kicked out of the band thus bringing Rosvo Dinny Harjula on drums
