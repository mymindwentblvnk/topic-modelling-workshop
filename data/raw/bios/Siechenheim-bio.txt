Siechenheim is archaic German for "home of the sick".

The band was formed in 2010, after bassist Schrat and guitarist Kobold played together for a while. In this formation Kobold also took over the drum and vocal parts. They create there first EP "Wenn Unheil erwacht..." at the end of the first year, all alone and after many changes inside the band. After an unsuccessfull period of search for other members, "Tier" joined the band behind the drums in the middle of 2011. In the end of 2012 their next Demo "German Black Metal" was released. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Siechenheim">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
