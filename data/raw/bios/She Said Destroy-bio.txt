She Said Destroy is a metal band from Oslo, Norway. Their musical influences comes from noise rock, thrash, death and black metal while the lyrics affects everything from mankinds search for the meaning of life to the problem with Scandinavians moving to southern countries. Still, She Said Destroy is a serious band but without some of the pompous attitude some bands possess.

The band played at the Inferno Festival in 2005 and released their debut album, Time Like Vines, in April the following year. The band also made their mark at the first Hove Festival in 2007 alongside Hatebreed and Neurosis. 

Their second album, This City Speaks In Tongues was released in November 2008 on Tabu Recordings and was met with widespread critical acclaim. The album is bubbling over with obscure references, technical intricacies and rich textures. This City Speaks In Tongues is a homage to urban darkness, to the black, throbbing heart that lies buried in any city. Aggressive, energetic, precise and without compromise.
