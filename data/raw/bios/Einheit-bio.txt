Einheit is a one-man act from northern Sweden. The music in short pressents a personal blend of Dark-Ambient and Field recordings, diffident drone music for relaxation and contemplation. If you are searching for music that will send you to places deep within the realm of imagination or are simply longing for sounds that will take you back to the world itself, this is the musical expression that you have been waiting for.
