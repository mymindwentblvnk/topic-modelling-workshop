Italian Atmospheric/Melodic/Avant-Garde Black Metal band from Agnone (Isernia), Molise. Formed in 2014.
Dawn of a Dark Age is the main project of multi-instrumentalist Vittorio Sabelli, a classical and jazz musician who gave the clarinet a leading role in black metal for the first time. Its dark timbre, together with fierce blastbeats and distorted guitars, allows him to explore new scenarios from moments of pure madness to the most atmospheric dream-born soundscapes.
