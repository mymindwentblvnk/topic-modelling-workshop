2) One day, 3 young shams decided to form a band. This band would be a metal band. This band would be known as Carcinogenic. Carcinogenic would be 'two more metal' than any other metal band (think one louder...). Carcinogenic would not ever adhere to the traditional band paradigm of practicing, writing songs or playing gigs. One formerly young sham, many years later would set up a myspace page (http://www.myspace.com/carcinogenicrocks ) for Carcinogenic, as even non-existent bands have pages these days. The formerly young sham proceeded to upload some decidedly dodgy "songs" to the myspace page. These were not metal. These were not even songs. The saga continues...
