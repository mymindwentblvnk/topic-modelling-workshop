Tower 8 is basically “a comic book rock opera set in a post apocalyptic world”. A great multimedia project that will tell the story through a series of experimental animations and an original soundtrack.

“In the future, the oceans recede leaving the world with too many inhabitants and too little water. Adding to the chaos is the appearance of new powers among the people: creativity has become a physical force.” (Source: Danny Uncanny)

The project was conceived by Daniel Cannizzaro and Gavin Brown, in December 2005. While Danny, joined by Mike Ashton, visualized the world and the characters of Tower 8, Gavin wrote and produced the music. (Source: Hatch your Egg)

This is their first joint effort, and it shows us a glimpse of this fantasy world. And a vast amount of goodness. I definitely want more!
