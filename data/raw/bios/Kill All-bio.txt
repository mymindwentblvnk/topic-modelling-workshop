Kill All is a Norwegian thrash metal band formed in 2004 after the members left their former band Disiplin. In 2006 a demo was recorded entitled "Urge to Annihilate". In search for a singer for the demo the band asked long time friend Secthdamon (Zyklon, Myrkskog, Odium, Emperor), he accepted. The band are currently searching for a singer/frontman for a steady line-up, planning gigs and writing songs for the debut album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/kILL+ALL">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
