Hybrid Symphonic Metal hailing from Mexico City, Mexico.

After recently signing a worldwide deal with Metal Music Bookings and Management, War Kabinett’s most recent album has been mixed and mastered by Anders Hahne at Mixtrak Studios in Sweden, and is ready to be unleashed to the world in 2015.

Since the bands launch in 2004, and the subsequent release of their debut EP "Weakminded" in 2007, War Kabinett have defended the idea of holding no limits to their music. They fuse together several metal styles that run from Power and Speed through to Thrash, Black and Death, combined with the majestic sound of a symphonic orchestra and choir, thus resulting in what they have designated as "Hybrid Symphonic Metal".

War Kabinett display outstanding, powerful and energetic performances, whether in a small club or on a festival stage. This has given them the opportunity to open for acts such as Primal Fear (Germany), Sinner (Germany), Therion (Sweden) and as “Special Guests” for the legendary Heavy Metal act from Germany, ACCEPT.

War Kabinett's new album called “In Mexico” is a blasting blend of destructive guitar riffs, brutal drumming, flawless bass playing, and incredible vocals that blend the deepest and most violent growling with the highest vocal tones of Heavy Metal.

“In Mexico” features the genius participation of Henjo Richter, lead guitarist of German power metal band Gamma Ray, and also The Kabinett Infernal Choir and Orchestra, both conformed by guest musicians from the most important orchestras and choirs from Mexico: National University Philarmonic Orchestra and Choir, and Minería Symphonic Orchestra.

Stay tuned for more news on the album, coming soon! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/War+Kabinett">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
