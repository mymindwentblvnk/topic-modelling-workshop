Tyran' Pace was a German (Stuttgart) heavy / speed metal band, strongly influenced by Judas Priest style, founded in 1983 by Ralf Scheepers (vocals) and Oliver Kaufmann. 

With Michael D. Young (guitar), Frank Mittelbach (guitar), Andy Ahues (bass) and drummer Edgar Patrick (ex-Sinner) they debuted with a demo Eye To Eye (1984). Young and Mittelbach left the group soon after. With Calo Rapallo (guitar) Tyran' Pace recorded their second LP, Long Live Metal (1985), and appeared on the Metal Hammer festival. In 1986 Dewor Sertic replaced Rapallo on guitar, and Andy Fallscheer came for Patrik on drums. In the same year, after the third release, Watching You (1986), the group disbanded. 

Ralf Scheepers continued with his career as a vocalist in Gamma Ray and Primal Fear.

The album Take A Seat In The High Row (1998) was released by a completely different group of people, ( Michael Dees (vocals), Fabian Schwarz (guitar), Jochen Issing (bass), Rüz Löser (drums) and  Alex Schmidt (keyboard) ), who obtained the rights to record under the Tyran' Pace logo. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tyran%27+Pace">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
