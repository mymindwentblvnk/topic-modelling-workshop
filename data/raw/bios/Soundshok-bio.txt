in ther own words "Soundshok formed ON December 15th 2001 with a mission to leak into the metal
world and grab it by the balls. Since the start we have taken every step
seriously and been very grateful for any help given to us. After sitting in
and drinking beer almost every night listening to metal only wishing we could
be that band, things have started to show after working hard and proving that
what ever you seek in life, if your dedicated and pull through all odds you
really can get what you want

We have played shows all over the UK proving our point and meeting alot of
good people along the way. Music is our life and no one can ever take that
away from us. We will be doing this for the rest of our lives only getting
stronger and stronger. One day we hope to be one of those bands like Slayer
or Hatebreed, It's only a matter of time! We are all in this for the music
and the music only. It means alot to us when on stage looking out at a crowd
losing it to our stuff! Without you people we would only be half the band we
are. So thanks to everyone thats either came to our shows. Bought our cd's or
even had a giggle with us, we only hope to continue this with the old and
new. We feel this is a new step within the band and it makes us more
determined. We look forward to meeting new fans. The best feeling in the
world is knowing that other people are listening to your music even if it is
slating or loving. Keep a close eye on Soundshok, we seek domination." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Soundshok">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
