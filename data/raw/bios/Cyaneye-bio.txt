5-Piece based Death Metal outfit with progressive and hardcore elements started mid 2010 in Melbourne, Australia. 

Self recorded Pre-Production Demos have been released and distributed by the band and were to be used to help record the debut E.P. but a change in the band has prevented this from happening. After the drummer and one of the guitarists leaving, the E.P. was put on hold and the pre-pro demos with programmed drums is the furthest point at present.

With a huge sound and a live set full of energy, these guys have had some good reviews and support from some of Melbournes more established acts. New material has a much heavier and more progressive sound than the tracks featured on the pre-production demos, but unfortunately, is not recorded yet.

Looking to re-solidify the line-up and start recording new material that is being written, the band hope to be hitting the stage again soon. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/cyaneye">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
