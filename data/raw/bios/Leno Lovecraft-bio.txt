Leno Lovecraft is a super sexy disco producer. His “songs tastefully reference everything from the italo disco of Cerrone and the driving funk of Ladies Choice to the vocodered synthpop a la Casco and BWH, plus no small amount of falsetto and pleasantly creative weirdness a la Sparks. Some songs even have the wailing, harmonized shred guitars (not to mention the crazy false ending thing). All of it is well produced, clever and colorful and all the more impressive in that it was crafted by a teenager.” – discoworkout.com <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Leno+Lovecraft">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
