Moondark was formed a cold and dark winter evening in the beginning of 1993 by Johan Jansson (Interment, Demonical, Regurgitate, Uncurbed, ex Centinex, Dellamorte...) and Kennet Englund (Interment, Subdive, ex Uncanny, Centinex, Dellamorte...) when they rehearsed covers of Crypt Of Kerberos, Eternal Darkness, and Bolt Thrower etc... In the birth Johan played guitar because he did mostly of the music in Moondark and Kennet played drums. Then Mattias Norrman (Katatonia, Subdive, ex Dellamorte) joined on guitar and after a while Johan and Kennet switched instruments.

Moondark decided to record a demo in Soundline Studios in Avesta later same year and asked Mats "Mabbe" Berggren (ex Fulmination) to join on bass and vocals. They recorded 7 songs and was engineered & mixed by Per Samuelsson and Moondark. The demo was simply named Demo1 and it was meant to be sent to labels for a record deal but that didnâ€™t happen because of laziness. The demo was just home printed in a couple of ex and was only given away to some friends...

Moondark only played live once at Musikhuset 1st October 1993, Avesta with Uncanny & Greedkick and the concert was caught on video.

Dreamtide Music released the full-lenght album with Moondark - entitled "The Shadowpath" limited to 299 copies January 2007. This recording was made back in 1993 but never released. The band gives us ultra slow and heavy death metal with utterly deep vocals, a must for the fans of early Crypt of Kerberos, Eternal Darkness, and Demilich etc. Moondark was a projectband with former and presents members from acts such as Katatonia, Dellamorte, Centinex, Demonical, Interment and Uncanny etc. Massive !!
