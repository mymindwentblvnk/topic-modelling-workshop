There are 3 bands with the name “Sinking”:

1. Sinking is a four-piece band from Pittsfield, MA taking influence from 90s alt-rock and emo bands such as Sunny Day Real Estate, Mineral, Failure and Rival Schools. The band maintains a DIY ethic, self-releasing two albums, booking  local shows and creating all merch and album artwork in house. 


2. Sinking are a nu-gaze rock band from Somerset, England. Formed in late 2010 for a local "Battle of the Bands" competition, they spent over a year nameless, writing only a handful of tracks and rarely playing together due to outstanding commitments. Being asked to open for a friend's band, the group decided to start practicing again and began to produce some new music and record in their bedrooms and backspaces.
