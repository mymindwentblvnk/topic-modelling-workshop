Altus Ultionis is a Balikesir, Turkish based black metal project of Samet Ozgur, Micke Backelin, and Sarah Özgür (the latter two members, while in the band, but never contributed). They have one demo, split (with Austkrigar), a "best of" compilation of previously released material, and a full length album released in 2005. They have since disbanded the project. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Altus+Ultionis">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
