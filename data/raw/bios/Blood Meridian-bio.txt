There are multiple artists with this name. First, Blood Meridian, a Canadian group that started in a hotel room during a Black Halos tour (of which the singer, songwriter, and guitarist of Blood Meridian, Matt Camirand, was a part), took their name from the Cormac McCarthy novel of the same name, and looked to mix punk, Americana, and rock influences together. Adding fellow Vancouver musicians Joshua Wells (Camirand's Pink Mountaintops and Black Mountain bandmate) on drums, Kevin Grant on bass, Jeff Lee on guitar, and Shira Blustein on organ and piano, the group began to gain attention in its native Canada, eventually releasing its V2 debut, Kick Up the Dust, in 2006.

Second, The Blood Meridian is a crust punk outfit from Pennsylvania.

 Third, Blood Meridian is the moniker of a producer known from the mixtape-site b00mb0x.org

4) Blood Meridian are a fairly known name in the circuit. They are a technical death outfit from Mumbai, and they actually do live up to the expectation of a death metal band. The growls, the drumming, the riffing, et al. They also add to the fact that Mumbai bands never disappoint, those dudes really know their shit. The EP Elements of Brutality is both brutal and technical in lethal doses, exhibiting both instrument proficiency and ability to compose on the same lines as what is established technical death metal. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Blood+Meridian">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
