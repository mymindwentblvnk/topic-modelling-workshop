The band formed in mid 2002 playing DOOM - DEATH from the beginning to this time, earning great acceptance by the local metal mongers since the style had almost never been played by any Panamanian band and people were eager for something different. 
The band's musical influences are the old works of Tiamat, Anathema, My Dying Bride, Paradise Lost, November's Doom, Desire, Winter, Septic Flesh and many others.  As for the ideology, they speak about the native pride of their ancestral cultures, shamanic power and practices, obscurity, energy and natural grandeur, of what's beyond and the meaning of the silent knowledge among other subjects. 
Their future plans are to keep on playing deep, emotional DOOM - DEATH and release an MCD pretty soon to reach more people around the world with their music.
