ORCIVUS was officially founded in January 2006 by Perditor, whose ambition with the band was to create individualistic/satanic art in the form of music and lyrics. Mortifer was asked to join the constellation a month or so after. By this time the band went under the name HAEMOPHILIA; a demo was recorded soon thereafter and it was very well received in the music press. This demo also caught the attention of Swedish/Portuguese label Next Horizon Records, and after some negotiation an alliance was formed. In connection with this the name was changed to ORCIVUS which better suits the vision of the band.
