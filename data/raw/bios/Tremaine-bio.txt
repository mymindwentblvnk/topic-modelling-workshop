tREmaINe was born and raised in Baltimore, Maryland He later moved and settled in Virginia. It was there he started to really come into his own. He also started developing a love for philosophy. He set out on a quest to musically break barriers and set new standards.”Never let them see you coming, you have to be an enigma” his friend Kenna would tell him. tREmaINe wrestled for years on how to effectively convey his message of philosophy with the music that he was creating.
On his upcoming self titled debut, tREmaINe teamed up with producer Phil Seadford and set out on the path of the musically uncharted. Phil has worked such artist as Jewel, Chad and Pharrell Williams of the Neptunes and American Idol winner Kris Allen.
The result is a wonderful mix of color, sound and aggressive approach to pop music that cannot be denied. You’ve never heard pop music quite like this. Whether he’s combining Beatles melodies with r&b tracks or crafting a song sounding like Justin Timberlake speaking with Fall out boy;
tREmaINe brings a certain inspiration and euphoria that feels refreshing, much like a musical tidal wave. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tremaine">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
