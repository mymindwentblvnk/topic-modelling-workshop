Ekrem Bora (born September 3, 1983 in Mönchengladbach) better known as Eko Fresh and also known as Elektro Eko is a German rapper of Turkish descent. His hometown is Mönchengladbach. He used to be in a relationship with the singer Valezka.

Ekrem grew up in Mönchengladbach and used to go to school until he stopped to pursue his musical interests. He grew up with his mother. After he left the school he had no profession so he worked in a shoe-shop. There he met for the first time the well-known rapper Kool Savas. Kool Savas was his mentor so he could early release his first LP on Royal Bunker, whose name was Jetzt kommen wir auf die Sachen. After this LP, Kool Savas, Eko Fresh, Valezka and Melbeatz founded Optik Records. There Eko Fresh released his 2nd LP König von Deutschland (King of Germany). Then, he fell in love with Valezka and that was not okay for Savas so Eko Fresh and Valezka left the Label and released their Songs on Sony BMG. There he released 3 LPs: Ich bin jung und brauche das Geld, Dünya Dönüyor - Die Welt dreht sich feat. Azra of Royal Bunker and L.O.V.E. featuring his Girlfriend Valezka.

50 Cent dissed Eko Fresh's Label "German Dream" on the Song Das Urteil by Kool Savas:

"Ey yo whats up. It's the kid 50 Cent. You are now tuned in to my man Kool Savas. Optik Boom. Destroy the German Dream, ya heard? G-G-G-G-G-Unit".

After approaching him on the subject, Eko Fresh reacted irrationally, trying to pull of a "rebel-stunt".

Eko Fresh and "Das Urteil"

Kool Savas replied with the most infamous disstrack in German HipHop History, entitled "Das Urteil" (The Judgement), with which he hoped to put an end to his former apprentice. This created a rift between Eko Fresh's "German Dream Team" and Kool Savas' renowned Optik Records.
