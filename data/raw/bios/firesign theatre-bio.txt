The Firesign Theatre is composed of Phil Proctor, Peter Bergman, David Ossman, and Phil Austin.  They started in California with their radio show in the 60s and have since become one of the premier comedy groups of all time, and have what is best described as a rabid cult following.  Their best known work  (and character) is "Nick Danger - Third Eye",  about a hard boiled movie detective from the 30s or 40s.  Spinoff works include Proctor and Bergman's "TV Or Not TV" about a fictional television station that is sometimes all too real, Phil Austin's "Roller Maidens From Outer Space", and many others.    <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Firesign+Theatre">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
