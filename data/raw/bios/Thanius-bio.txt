A heavymetal band from Ume√•, a city in the northern regions in Sweden, founded by vocalist Tobias Hellgren around 2001.
All instruments and vocals on two first demos were recorded by Tobias himself, with exceptions of keyboards and guitarsolos which were recorded by co-producer Marcus "Vargher" Norman of Naglfar/Bewitched.
As of writing, Tobias has gathered a couple of talented persons for an upcoming EP containing selected tracks from the old demos as well as all new written material.
