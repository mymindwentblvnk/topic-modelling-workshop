Mannepenis(Manpenis) was started a late night in the middle of the winter in Stavanger, Norway by Michael and Aasta. They wanted to have a reason to make fun of the traditional Norwegian Black Metal bands. Soon they had teamed up with bassist Sindre and drummer Danny. Both Michael and Aasta were going to be on vocals, with Michael on guitar. This task soon got too big for the little band, seeing as nobody knew their instruments at all. Drummer Terje and his brother Kristoffer hailed from Pain of Elohim to help them out. Danny took over guitar, Michael only did vocals, Kristoffer did session guitar for two gigs. This line-up played at AMPFest 2006 two times, one time at Metropolis and one time at Folken. After the summer the permanent guitarist Inge came into the picture. Aasta moved to England, so Michael took over the role of singing all songs until her return. Mannepenis played live again at "Skeive Dager" and at a 50th birthday of one of Michaels work buddies. They were booked again to his 60th birthday... <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mannepenis">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
