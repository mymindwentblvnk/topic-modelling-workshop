Upcast was formed by guitarists Fkod and Ed_Gain in early 2008. A lot or beer had to be brutally slaughtered before the two arrived at terrible certainty. Despite the noise and hellish debauchery of an ongoing DevilDriver concert at one of Moscow's venues, they had enough brainpower to turn back to good old thrash for inspiration...

Upcast is a mix of bay area thrash, teutonic thrash, and modern metal/hardcore styles, spiced up with lyrics about the horrors of mankind, brutal slaughter of animals, the apocalypse and other promising subjects. The result is modern thrash metal - in its purest form.

The band has also coined the term "alcomoshing" to describe the moshpit action at its concerts, and the song Alcomosh is a tribute to Upcast fans who have been devotedly supporting the band over the years.

To date, Upcast has released four EP's. Three of them feature Igor ShyGuy Sedunov, formerly of Nancial, on vocals. They are The Fear (2009), Legions of Thrash (covers, 2009), and Dead Simple (2010).

The new EP, Der Franziskaner Kult, was released in 2013. It is the first to feature Rodion Shurlepov as the full-time lead singer of the band. It is also the first to contain clean singing, adding diversity to the vocals. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Upcast">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
