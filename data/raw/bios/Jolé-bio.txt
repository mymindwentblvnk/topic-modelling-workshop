Jol√© is the moniker of London based songwriter Joshua Oliver. Blending his love of folk, indie and electronic music he creates a soundscape taking influence from songwriters such as Sufjan Stevens, Beck and Chris Martin. Since the release of his debut album last year he has amassed just over 2 million streams and toured across the UK and Europe.

In August of 2019 Joshua took a trip to LA and here started the bones of new music which was inspired by his time there. His upcoming EP is a homage to his favourite area, Silver Lake where he stayed. The EP is a lyrically honest and stripped back collaboration with friends past and present and is out now. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jol%C3%A9">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
