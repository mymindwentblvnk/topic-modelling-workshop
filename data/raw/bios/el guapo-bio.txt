El Guapo was born as a two-piece in Washington, DC in 1996. Through the years and through various instrument/lineup changes, the band has continually blurred the lines between art-punk and the avant-garde. In the late 90s the band released two records on Resin Records as well as a CD of improvisational works on their own label, Mud Memory in 2000. In March 2001, El Guapo, then a 3 piece, began work at National Recording Studio in DC with Phil Manley (Trans Am) where the band recorded their first album for Dischord Records, "Super/System." The 42 minute final edit is a testament to the band's multi-instrumental versatility and innovative approach to music making. "Fake French," El Guapo's second Dischord release, was self-recorded in numerous sessions over a six month period and was released in March 2003. After crafting an explosive live set in over 100 Stateside and European shows in 2002 , El Guapo has continued to tour the US and Europe throughout 2003 and 2004. In early 2004 the band was expaned to a four piece with the addition of drummer Josh Blair (who also plays in Orthrelm). The newly expaned El Guapo were renamed Supersystem and are currently recording for Touch and Go Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/El+Guapo">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
