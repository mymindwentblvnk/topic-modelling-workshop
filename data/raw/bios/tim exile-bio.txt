Born in 78, DJed for a bit, made music, heard my music on the wireless, decided I was a musician, got into making tweaked out music, released an album of tweaked out music, made a machine for improvising tweaked out music, recorded an album of entirely improvised tweaked out music entitled 'Tim Exile's Nuisance Gabbaret Lounge'.
