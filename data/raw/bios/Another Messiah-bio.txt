Another Messiah play energetic, atmospheric and innovative metal: post-doom metal . The young Dutch band have received unanimous critical acclaim for their ability to combine a wide variety of different styles, yet always remaining loyal to their somber and melancholic undertone. The dark atmosphere is enhanced by the sound of a true classical oboe, which gives the band an “ear-catching” appearance. Influences can be heard from bands such as My Dying Bride, Opeth, Amorphis, Gorefest, Rammstein and Orphanage. However, sounds from styles that are far from metal are present as well. 
You could call it doom metal, death-doom metal , progressive doom , or progressive metal. But the best way to call it is post-doom

In 2003, Another Messiah released an EP called ‘Another Renaissance’. This EP was enthusiastically received by the Dutch media and soon thereafter a Dutch and a Central European tour followed, both being very successful for the band. From 2004 the band focused on writing new material for their yet to come debut album ‘Dark Dreams, My Child’. The album was recorded at the Excess studios (Gorefest, Ayreon, Sinister, After Forever) in the end of 2005 and was produced by Joost van de Broek, known of his work in After Forever and Ayreon. In 2006 Another Messiah toured through Central Europe once again, followed by an extensive tour through The Netherlands and a European mini-tour in 2007. All tours got very positive reactions in some zines and from the fans on their website. In early 2007 Another Messiah inked a multiple record deal with Restrain Records, who hereby presents the amazing and not to miss ‘Dark Dreams, My Child’!
