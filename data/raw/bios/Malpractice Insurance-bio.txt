Malpractice Insurance began as Bastardo in October 2008 with Dr. Kevin Cysts doing vocals and Ivo doing all instruments including vocals. The following month, they released Malsurgical O-pyogenic of Necropathos (or the "Pathological Grindcore" demo) which was left at many a show and mailed to many people. Anxious to play shows, Bastardo recruited Dr. Baby Chico (drums) and Dr. Bathory (bass) to complete the surgical team.

The following year, many shows were played and we also recorded a split with our friends Nazmi Hoxha that was released on True Violence. Sometime in 2009, Dr. Bathory decided to part ways with his pathological cohorts. Without a bassist, Bastardo continued to play shows and recorded some songs that still remain unreleased. Later that same year, due to circumstances beyond both parties control, Doctors Kevin Cysts and Baby Chico parted ways with Ivo, who continued to record as Bastardo alone.

In 2010, after some shows in Arizona with a stand-in guitarist known as Dr. Assblood, Ivo recruited Dr. Grub Grinder (“Grubs”) behind the kit and together they recorded for a split with mincers Lt. Dan. With this new and improved line up (still looking for a bassist though), it was decided that the name of the band would be changed to Malpractice Insurance to better reflect our music and line up change. Also just finished recording for our 7".

We are always interested in releasing splits. Lables, bands, etc., please get in contact!!! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Malpractice+Insurance">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
