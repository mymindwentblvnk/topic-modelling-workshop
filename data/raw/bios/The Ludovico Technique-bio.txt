The name itself stems from the drug-assisted aversion therapy found in the novel and film "A Clockwork Orange", in which the patient is forced to view violent imagery while injected with experimental medication in an attempt to condition the subjects behavior. 

The Ludovico Technique as a band takes this concept and transforms it into music. The lyrical content draws from personal experience and observation - you will hear nothing which has not been translated from feeling to sound. 

It is harsh industrial music highlighting the dark aspects of the human experience as well as the depths to which the human mind can deteriorate. 

In 2010, the band released their self titled debut EP. 

After their debut album "Some Things Are Beyond Therapy" in 2012 and the follow up "We Came to Wreck Everything" in 2013, both released by Metropolis Records worldwide, Ludovico Technique have stormed the scene with their unique take on harsh industrial music, drawing from old school influences and an emotional drive to produce a sound that expresses an understanding of the dark aspects of the human experience and the depths to which man's mind can deteriorate. Ludovico Technique bring every ounce of the music's emotional gravity to live shows in full force, delivering performances that fully reflect the intensity of the sound itself in the form of a physical, visually stimulating stage show. Under a wash of rhythmic lights, songwriter/vocalist Ben V- unleashes visceral energy into every song, accompanied by keyboardist Evan B. and drummer Alex A. to create a dynamic audio/visual live experience for each viewer. Ludovico Technique bring a passionate force all their own to every performance, keeping focus on the artistic integrity and expressive sincerity that continuously define the music.
