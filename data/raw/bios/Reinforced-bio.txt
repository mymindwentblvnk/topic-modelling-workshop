After the implosion of the band Forced in 2003 singer/songwriter Jim Semonik recruited the help of good friends and live band members Turner and Ben Bloom (of Agnes Wired for Sound) to continue the spirit and sound of the band. Thus Rein[Forced] was born. Long time friend Cory McRae, of the band Singine is also lending his vocal talents to the band. After many successful live shows, "Futile Longings of a Condescending Man" was released in March of 2006. Ben Bloom passed away in April of 2006. He will be sadly missed. Semonik describes the sound as an evolution from the Forced days and the next logical step for the band. The album will be a mix of hard EBM/dark electro with light touches of drum and bass. The boys have started work on the next full length "X Amount of Stabwounds in the Back."
