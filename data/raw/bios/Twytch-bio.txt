Genre: Hard Rock (Heavy/ Hard Rock)
Hometown: Boston, Massachusetts

TWYTCH was formed in 1998 with a solid mindset, “Success at any cost.” The Lowell, MA based metal/hardcore band has persevered through the past 5 years and will continue to march forward. No matter what obstacles are thrown at this band, TWYTCH has and will overcome them. With a vigorous and consistent performance schedule, the act has become stronger both mentally as well as musically. TWYTCH currently have released two albums and are writing new material on a regular basis. Both albums have been very well received in the New England area. With an increasing number of concert attendance, TWYTCH is becoming a band more and more respected in the music industry. From a band member’s point of view: “What’s intense about this band…” Vocalist Matt McChesney states, “Is that we lure you in with a great melody, only to rip your face off with undeniable rage again and again, it’s a beautiful thing.” True Indeed. After one listen to the incredibly brutal yet keenly melodic “Swallow the Stitches,” (from the EP release justly titled “Hatred”) you won’t know whether to hide under your bed, or bury a pickaxe into the forehead of your sleeping lover. Released September 19th 2003, “Hatred” is sure to take these five unrelenting characters from Lowell MA, farther than ever before. From the catchy hooks of “Return to Ashes” to the murderously haunting “Echoes” and “Enemy”, this album leaves one with their jaw on the floor begging to be furiously beaten with a sledgehammer!

TWYTCH later changed their band name to Hell Within
