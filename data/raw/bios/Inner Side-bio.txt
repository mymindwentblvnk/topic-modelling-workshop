Founded in November 2006 by Amaro Assad (guitar), Yves Pessanha (drums), Arthur Bernardez (vocals) and Lucio Almeida (bass),originally went by the name of "Inner Strength". The first time that the band presented themselves was at an event called "Rock à 5 Reais I" managed by Amaro Assad, the band had only one month of existence. By the beginning of the year 2007, Bruno P. Soares had joined the band in addition for one more guitarist and at the same time the bassist Lucio Almeida had left. Soon after Lucio A. had left another bassist joined the group, named Jean, he didn't "fit in" and left a few weeks later. After that, Diego Carvalho took the place of bassist of the band, with the new formation, they changed their name to Inner Side. The band participated in a lot of events such as "Alterna Campos I e II", "Rock à 5 Reais II" and many others live shows around the town. By the beginning of the year 2008 Arthur (vocals) had left the group, soon after Rodolfo Barreto was the one they choose to take his place. In may 2008, Inner Side participated in the "II Festival Underground" showing a huge improvement, and got lots of  positive feedback such as that it was their best performance so far. Rodolfo left the band right after. Diego Carvalho (bassist) took the place of  vocals, along with this change Lucio Almeida took back his place as bassist of the band. This is the last formation of the band. Inner Side starts to fix themselves into Metalcore, but never forgetting the influences seeing in some of their own songs.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Inner+Side">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
