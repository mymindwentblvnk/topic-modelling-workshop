About
Pester The Pure is an anti-fractal entity,
molded by its sheer tendency for the total negation 
and eventually dissolution of the human factor.

Pester The Pure is created in order to bring disorder
anxiety, obscenity and an inhuman perspective towards everything living
either that be humans, animals, insects, humanoids, extraterrestrials.

Pester The Pure bears no signs of remorsefulness or pity over anything natural or unnatural. Seeing the whole creation from an eschatological and nihilistic point of view it strives for the extinction of any innate or extrinsic anthropological delusions such hope, despair, beauty, ugly, good, bad, right, wrong, religion, atheism, ideals, values, axioms.

Pester The Pure believes in nothing and yet hates itself for even believing in that too.

Pester The Pure is not. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pester+The+Pure">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
