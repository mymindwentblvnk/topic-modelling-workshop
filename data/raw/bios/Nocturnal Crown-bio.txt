Nocturnal Crown was formed in 1997. under name Gothic Inferno , in a small town Zadar, at the eastern coast of Adriatic sea, in Croatia. At the begining, the band played mostly death metal with melodic sequences, and down pitched vocals, but at the end of 1998. band began experimenting with black metal, and changed name into Nocturnal Crown . By that time the band already had some of ten-fifteen songs of death-black melodic metal. The first gig was in 1999. at ( DHM- Citadela ) Infusion fest in Zadar. In lack of financial meanings, as no member was employed, the band could not affort studio record, so N.C. recorded a small garage demo in 1999. ,called In autumn shadow frost , containing five songs: 1. Into vanity and perdition , 2. Through astrophobical maze , 3. Screams from heaven (instr.) , 4. In autumn shadow frost , and 5.
