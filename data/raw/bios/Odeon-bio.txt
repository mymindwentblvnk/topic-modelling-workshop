"Odeon" is the name of at least two musical groups:
1. Brazilian Ska Rock band ( http://www.myspace.com/bandaodeon )
2. Romanian pop-folk band established around 1982 in Buzau, one of the first to use the manea (ciftetelli) pattern in a non-lautaresque context (see muzica lautareasca). Among the best known songs by Odeon are: "Trenul vietii" ("Train of Life", ca. 1984), "Cenusareasa" ("Cinderella", ca. 1986), "Floraresele" ("The Flower Girls", 1986), "Din prima zi cand te-am vazut" ("Ever Since the First Day I Saw You", 1987). Different lineups were built around lead singer Costel Geambasu (also a drummer in early years, before ca. 1985). The original lineup also featured lead guitarist Costel Petrescu a.k.a. Bujaverca. In recent years, Odeon went on hiatus after Geambasu's leaving the band; however, he sometimes credits his solo work under the name of Odeon. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Odeon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
