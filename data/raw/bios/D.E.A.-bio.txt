D.E.A. is the name of two diferent groups:

1) Underground Rap group from Serbia, consisting of Nastie and LeXuS, and formed in 2004. They only recorded a few songs together, but never really split up. Nastie continued to record his own solo songs but  the D.E.A. project is still in plans and will be continued. The group was kind of a hood legend at the time and alot of people in their hometown (as well as in Belgrade) remembers their work, no matter how underground they are.

2) Rap group from Houston, Texas, USA.
 D.E.A. stands for Dead End Alliance. It was a group from the neighborhood of Dead End on the southside of Houston, TX. The members are DJ Screw, Kay-K and brothers Fat Pat & Hawk. This album was released in 1998 on Dead End Records. Production was done by DJ Screw, Koldjak, D-Red of the Botany Boys, Slash, Grim and Swift. The beats are flawless and have hints of G-Funk in them. The lyrics range from gangsta street rhymes to laid back hustling flows. Featuring on the album are members of the Screwed Up Click like Lil' Keke, Big Pokey, Mike D, E.S.G., 3-2, Big Moe and C-Note of the Botany Boys. This is a very smooth record which has the ability to ride itself out. Also this album is dedicated in the loving memory of Mr. Fat Pat. Though this was the group's only album, a chopped & screwed version was also released. D.E.A. and the S.U.C. eventually fell apart after the deaths of Fat Pat, DJ Screw, Hawk and Big Moe. Rest in peace to all the fallen soldiers of the legendary Screwed Up Click.
