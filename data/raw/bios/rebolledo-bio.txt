Rebolledo, born and raised in Xalapa, Mexico, is resident of the legendary "Santanera", in Playa Del Carmen, Mexico. There he developed his very own style of playing, mixing old and new odd dancetracks, driven by a persistent disco groove Feeling the necessity of links between tracks he used to play in the club, he started developing his own rough and edgy rhythms. Matias Aguayo, whom he had played with several times at his night in the "Santanera" got interested in his material, helped him to develop it and to share it with people via his label "CÃ³meme" <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rebolledo">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
