At the beginning were Riccardo and Ioan…
then Enrico and Manuel joined and formed Eat Me Clown: a lot of gigs and a promo cd with 4 tracks which recieved good reviews, above all one on RockSound.

Then the 2005: the band need to embrace new sonority, so the departure of Manuel and the arrival of Ste on bass give chance to this will. The guys started to write songs inspired by American and European metalcore scene, bursting out thrash attitude, mostly in vocal parts.
It’s time for live shows: new songs get such awesome answers from the crowd that the band can play at important live clubs, like La Gabbia and Vinile.
Pushed by the wish of put down the new material and by the pressures :-) of the most relentless fans, the band decides to spend the summer of 2006 recording a second promo cd.

In february 2009, Eat Me Clown will record their Debut Album at WEST LINK STUDIOS(Pisa) with ALE PAOLUCCI (Raw Power/Rebel Devil)!! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Eat+Me+Clown">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
