Gold Fir is the dreamy new musical duo, simply known as Mabel and James. Not ones to reveal a lot about themselves (they're both from London), the long-time friends formed when they realised they shared the same musical taste and song-writing sensibilities. Even their name is mysterious. "Gold Fir can mean many different things," the muse, "to us it can be fun, funky, sassy, serious, sad and amusing." But for Mabel and James, it's more about the music, anyway. Speaking of, the duo are currently working on their forthcoming EP. If it's anything like the freshly released track Night Walk, a slick 80s inspired offering with a lot of sass and soul, you're sure to be in for a big treat. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gold+Fir">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
