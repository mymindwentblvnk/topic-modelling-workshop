Jae Millz (born Jarvis Mills; September 11, 1983) is an American rapper currently signed to Young Money Entertainment.

Millz was born in Harlem, Manhattan, New York City. His rapping abilities gained him a spot on a DJ Kay Slay mixtape. Millz gained popularity in mixtape battles (most notably against Murda Mook,ty streetz, Sire Castro, and E-Ness). Millz' underground popularity earned him a recording deal with Wanna Blow Ent.

Jae Millz was the first artist signed to Tone & Nige's Wanna Blow Ent. label. Due to the hype surrounding Jae in late 2003, Wanna Blow signed a distribution deal with Warner Bros. Records. Despite the popularity and hype, Warner Bros. failed to deliver an album, leading to Jae Millz and Wanna Blow departing the label. They immediately reached a deal with SRC Records and Universal Records

Due to a lack of promotion of his music, Jae Millz and the Wanna Blow camp would leave SRC Records and Universal Records.
