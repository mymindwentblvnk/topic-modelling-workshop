Lagna was a japanese visual kei band, active from 1998-2000.

Even though they were active for 2 years, they only released a couple of demo-tapes and 2 CD's

Lagna was signed on the famous indies label Matina and had similar music to most of the bands on the label.

While most members went on to the band ＧＡＲＤＥＮ, guitarist KAGUYA and former bassist KAZUYA did not.
