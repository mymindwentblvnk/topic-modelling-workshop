Creinium is a hybrid metal band based in Helsinki, Finland.

Creinium’s music has always been about mixing together everything about metal, as well as many other genres, that the two songwriters Aleksi and Antti like. Creinium may superficially seem like melodic death or dark metal, but a more perceptive observation might reveal influences from all kinds of music. Influences from progressive, folk, industrial, doom, death, black and dark metal, as well as jazz and electric music for instance.

Creinium’s music is diverse, distinctive and surprising. It might not open itself and hit you at the first listen, and it’s not supposed to. Creinium’s music is characterized by the mixing of different genres and subgenres, but also the strong and versatile use of keyboards and complex song structures.
