Alustrium is a five-piece melodic metal band from the northern suburbs of Philadelphia. The band was formed in June of 2008 by guitarist/vocalist Chris Jelly and bassist Brett Leftwich, and was known at first as Syndicate. Many lineup changes occurred until guitarist Mikey D joined the band, and, along with old temporary members, the band was known as For What Was Once. This didn't last long, and eventually Joey Coates was recruited on drums, they changed their name to Altered Image, and Greg Bono became the vocalist.

As Altered Image, they made a name for themselves after playing many successful shows and gaining a dedicated fan base. They proved themselves by winning or placing in every battle of the bands they played in, and they even received exposure in media outlets such as the newspaper and on websites. However, in June of 2009, the band received the horrifying news that their beloved friend and frontman Greg Bono had passed away. This was a major set back for the band, as it was emotionally stressful and, consequently, they were lacking a member. As time went on and the band came to their senses, they recruited Jerry Martin (previous vocalist of Regression) on vocals. After a few shows with Jerry, the band changed their name for the final time to ALUSTRIUM. In the beginning of 2010, there were conflicts with drummer Joey Coates, and he was replaced on good terms with EHB. This is the current and final lineup, and shows are played consistently, sometimes even weekly.

Alustrium is currently going strong, and their future looks bright.
