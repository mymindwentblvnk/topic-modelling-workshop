"Jerusalem bred 28 year old singer-songwriter.
Sometimes it takes a punch in the guts to realize you ain’t where you should be standing. Around a year or so ago, that’s exactly what Asaf Avidan got...(more like a punch, two kicks and an elephant jumping on the guts). Picking up the pieces and looking around he found he didn’t like where he was living, where he was working, or basically much of what he was doing. From there he packed his stuff , made friends with his guitar, and started writing music.
It’s sad to write only when you’re sad... and it’s sadder to find out that you’ve been doing a lot of writing... but still... it’s life... and you got to catch it while it’s hot.
In june 06 "Now that you’re leaving" - his debut e.p. came to life. Since then, Asaf has been touring feverishly with his acoustic guitar , inviting different friends to join the parade.
Now, treading a rockier path, Asaf is joined by his super fly gang of mischiefs -
"The Mojo’s".
