Mortus Delict is a metal band from Zadar, Croatia. 
Mortus Delict was found in 2007 but due to problems with rehearsal place
the band didn't start with serious work til 2008. After numerous gigs and constant
line-up changes, in 2011 Mortus Delict finally released their first promo CD ''Blood(s)pit''
with solid line-up. It was well received by the audience. Since 2008 the band
has built a loyal fanbase. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mortus+Delict">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
