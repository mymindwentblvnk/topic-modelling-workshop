2) A Japanese visual kei band named chariots on the label UNDER CODE PRODUCTION. chariots formed late 2007 after the split of the famous visual kei band Phantasmagoria by former vocalist 戮 (Riku). With a concept of "aggressive art" the band creates a sound that "conveys elegance and beauty even while producing a violent, heavy rock sound". In 2010 all members except Riku leave the band, turning chariots into a solo project.
