Brought together by the forces of evil in 1997, this 4 piece gang of hoodlums have been squeezing the balls of Denver with their unique blend of punk rock, hardcore, metal, thrash, and satire... also aptly referred to as "Berzerk-Core". With their amazing high energy, FYF have played hundreds upon hundreds of shows in and around the Denver area, including shows with such bands as Bad Luck 13, The Forgotten, Toxic Narcotic, The Casualites, Hudson Falcons, and D.I. to name a few. They have also been on several independently financed tours of this great country of ours (the U.S. ya moron), spreading their plague to millions of unsuspecting citizens. ROCK ON..... OR BE DESTROYED!!!  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Forth+Yeer+Freshman">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
