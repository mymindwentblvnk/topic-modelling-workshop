In the second semester of the year 2000, Wolf Lutemkrat began to compose. After a few experiences, he decided to make his music all by himself (this way, he could be independent with his ideas).

In 2002, LUTEMKRAT rises as a one-man-band. The word "Lutemkrat" does not have a real meaning, itâ€™s just a conceptual abstraction that defines the music themes: destruction, war, chaos, hatred, loyalty and honour.

In 2003, the mCD "Never Surrender" was recorded with 4 tracks: extreme music influenced by the 90's black metal. The first edition was released in slipcase format limited in 66 hand-numbered copies.

Wolf Lutemkrat recorded the first full lenght CD entitled "The Last Survivor" that will be officially release by the canadian label Bleak Art Records. The result is extreme music, along accoustic guitar interludes and elements which reflects his identity.

Wolf Lutemkrat: Dark voice and evil chants, electric guitar, bass guitar, drums and percussion, lyrical obscurity and poetry.
