Tristania was a Norwegian gothic metal band formed in 1996 by Morten Veland, Einar Moen and Kenneth Olsson. Tristania's music is usually classified as gothic metal with death influences, due to its strong tie and legacy within the gothic metal history. Their songs largely dealt with dark and sentimental topics, including depression, sadness, suicide, love, absence, and anger. The band had not had any known activity from 2016 to October 2018, when they announced that they would perform at 70000 Tons of Metal in early 2019. In 2022, they announced they had disbanded.
