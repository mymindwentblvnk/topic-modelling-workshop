The roots of Ninnuam stretch back to the late fall in 2001, where the original members formed a band called yXa. Without any permanent singer in the band at that time, they started their search for a unique sound that today can be described as a dark and brutal mixture of death and black metal. In connection to the recruitment of the singer and the keyboard player of today, the group changed their name and became Ninnuam in summer 2002.

The story continues with some hysterical and bloody live performance, before the band ended up in the studio to finalise their debut demo, named "Scar Salvation". The impact of "Scar Salvation" was immediate and fervent, with their steely combination of their raw energy, multilingual lyrical passion and brutal yet melodic song writing.

Ninnuam is successfully creating music as unexpected and catchy as it is devastating. "We all have different influences which are reflected in our music, but we do not try to do the same things over again, instead we just write how we feel and not trying to follow any trends."

They have newly signed a record deal with the Finnish label "Low Frequency Records". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ninnuam">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
