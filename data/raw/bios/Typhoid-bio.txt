Their music is dry, grinding and blasting brutal death metal with drifting technical guitars, deep growling vocals and manaic filled drummer. The band was influenced by bands like Suffocation, Dying Fetus, Monstrosity, Necrophagist, Deeds of Flesh, Cannibal Corpse and Pyrexia. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Typhoid">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
