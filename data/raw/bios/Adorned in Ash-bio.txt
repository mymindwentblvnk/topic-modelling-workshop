Adorned in Ash (AiA) is a female fronted Christian Extreme Hybrid Metal band from Pretoria, South Africa. Our influences include thrash, speed and groove metal to more progressive & technical death & black metal.

We are influenced by bands such as Becoming the Archetype, Fearscape, Antestor, Woe of Tyrants, Impending Doom, Synnove, Sympathy, War Of ages, Miseration, Tourniquet, Mortification, Living Sacrifice, Frost like Ashes, A Hill To Die Upon and EXTOL, all being Christian bands within the Metal Genre

We aim to bring melody as well as technicality into our music, in order to appeal to a wide and varying audience, without ever compromising on the brutality & power of the death metal genre.

Ultimately, the band exists for one purpose and one purpose only, and that is to bring glory to the One Eternal and Mighty God, who sent His Son Jesus Christ to rescue us from hellâ€¦and ourselves.

Thanks to His death, we can truly live. Our bodies may fade away, but our hearts are being transformed from strength to strength. This temporary world may turn against us, but we will endure forever under His perfect love and faithfulness. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Adorned+in+Ash">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
