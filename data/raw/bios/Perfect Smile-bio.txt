Perfect Smile was born on September 2004 as the natural evolution of Nexar, the project where Eduardo Corral (bass), Pedro Rodrigo (drums) and Sebastian Amengual (Guitar) grew up as musicians. After a small pause they put all their effort together into this new adventure. A few months later Oihana Basilio joined the band at the keyboards.

The project is focused on progressive rock, although it tries combines the best form different, and sometimes even opposite, worlds. From Heavy Metal to Jazz or even Classical like Bach, almost every style fits in. Influences are countless.

On June 2006, Nacho Ruiz (ex-Arwen vocalist) joins Perfect Smile, completing the band (with voice, guitar, bass, keyboard and drums)

On December 2006 Eduardo Ortiz joins the band at the keyboards after Oihana's departure. A few months later, on March 2003, Pedro leaves the country (and the band), being immediately replaced by Juan Palacios at drums.

With Juan, Perfect Smile was finally closed and the band began recording their first demo album "Smile", that was release on September 2007.

The band is currently focused on live shows and the composition of new songs.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Perfect+Smile">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
