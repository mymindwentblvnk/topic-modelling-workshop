The Kerosene Man (Steve) was born in Canada in 1974. He grew up listening, from an early age, to bands such as Iron Maiden, Accept, AC/DC etc. (and though his musical tastes have expanded over the years he still feels strongly influenced by thesee groups)In the early months of 1988 Steve got his firszt guitar and decided he was going to be a famous rocker. That didn't happen. And though through the years he felt discouraged many times to the point of giving up entirely He continued with the pursuit of his dreams by playing in various bands in his home country but they went nowhere. It was not until he met his current wife and was wisked away from Canada to Belgium that he saw a possibility, perhaps not for fame but at least to get his music listened to. He encountered a local band called Southern Voodoo and the impact their music had on him was incredible. He took the name The Kerosene Man from one of their songs. Through the advice of the lead singer, Steve set out to somehow get his music listened to. Through the magic of homerecording, TKM (The Kerosene Man) was born. Using a midi program in place of real drums (Mr Kerosene doesn't know how to play them or he would) his guitars, basses and rather unique voice he put together a MySpace music profile, which through various steps brought him to Last fm. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Kerosene+Man">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
