Lukas Batteau is a singer-songwriter from Utrecht, The Netherlands. Since the release of a home recorded demo back in 2007, Lukas Batteau has performed in many venues throughout The Netherlands, Germany, and the USA.

On August 31 2008, Lukas Batteau released his first studio recorded EP, produced together with ‘In A Cabin With’ producer Maarten Besseling and Ravinia Thwaites from RnR. The EP was well received by music magazines like OOR, Musicfrom, and German indie magazine Soundmag.

At the end of 2008, he decided to take his songs in a whole different direction, teaming up with Berry Vink, Josine van der Splinter, and later Rolf Perdok, to form nineties influenced rock band Yen Harley. In 2009 the band played in many major venues in The Netherlands, supporting acts like Go Back To The Zoo, Paulusma and Gomez. They started recording their debut album 'The substance of things' which was released on March 28th of 2010 with label Dying Giraffe.

At the end of 2010, Yen Harley broke up, and Lukas Batteau was on his own again, finding himself back on the singer-songwriter track. Since then he has been busy with writing new material, gathering a group of musicians, and planning an EP that is scheduled for August 31, 2012 <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lukas+Batteau">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
