Horrorcore rapper originally coming from Düsseldorf, Federal Republic of Germany. From the very beginning, he cooperated with the infamous Rap label Hirntot Records from Berlin. The tie between them became tighter when it was announced that he was signed to Hirntot Records in 2006 and therefore moved to Berlin. Today, he's a kind of press spokesman for the label and has the biggest output together with Blokkmonsta.

He also wrote the yet to be released Hirntot novel "Jäger Der Nacht" (Eng.: "Hunter Of The Night") and published a poem collection in 2011. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Schwartz">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
