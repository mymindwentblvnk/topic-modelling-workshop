There are more than one artist under the same name:

The Pearlettes were protegees of Sonny Bono when he was a young 'music row' scuffler striving to support a wife and daughter on the thin gruel of one-off production deals made with fly-by-night Los Angeles labels.
Sisters Lynda and Sheila Galloway got together with fellow teenagers Mary Meade and Priscilla Kennedy in 1961, originally sharing the same manager as the Blossoms. They auditioned for Bono who produced their first release for his GO label, as well as a second 45 for Vault, a label run by a distributor Bono was working for at the time. For their next outing, Bono took the girls to Vee-Jay expressly to record an answer song to the label's recent smash 'Duke Of Earl' by Gene Chandler.
Galloway left the quartet soon after 'Duchess of Earl' had charted while Priscilla Kennedy went on to cut some sides with the Delicates on Challenge and with Brenda Holloway in the Watesians on the Donna label.

The Pearlettes was a Sweden girl group in the 60s. Formed by the Stockholm girls Marianne Törnqvist, Annika Norström and Jane Sannemo (later replaced by Lena Conradsson), they received their name due to an homage to the female group that were Ray Charles' backing vocals, the Raelettes. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Pearlettes">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
