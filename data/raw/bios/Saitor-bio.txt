Saitor was the precursor of Finnish metal band Nomicon. The band released two demo tapes in 1989 before changing their name to Nomicon the following year. They were often mistakenly thought to be an American band and their demo tapes were distributed as such.

Band Members: Tommi Launonen - Bass, Tero Huttunen - Drums, Ville Panhelainen - Guitars, Jani Salminen - Vocals <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Saitor">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
