Necrophacus is a black/death metal band from Salt Lake City, UT. They were formed in 2000 after Steve, Greg, Tommy, and Shane met at a local record shop and decided to start a band due to similar musical interests. The intention was to create black metal, but as the writing proceeded some death metal riffs were incorporated as well. This is not typical black/death metal, as it is written from a more traditional heavy/power metal base and expanded upon with extreme metal techniques. They broke up in 2008 to pursue other musical ventures, with Steve and Tommy starting a progressive/power metal band called Sonic Prophecy with members of Ashen Legacy and Greg taking over vocal duties for Malignant Inception. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Necrophacus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
