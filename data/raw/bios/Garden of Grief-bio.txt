Garden of Grief is a one-man-project by Boronian Sturmfels. The idea rose up during the Summer of 2008. Back then the concept included session memebers for guitars and bass. That plan was ommited early in 2009 when the decision to work alone was made. Of course the newly achieved guitar skills were not sufficient for recording the songs that had already been written to be played by session members, so a set of new songs had to be created for the first release.

Songs were quickly recorded with the equipment that was at hand - a small marshall bass amp and a mixer. It took about four month to learn and record all the songs needed for the first release which was finally produced in September 2009. "Of Shattered Dreams and Nostalgic Melancholy" was released on the 11th of September on CD, limited to 200 copies.

Since then, Garden of Grief has changed in style and quality. With the second release "Novembernebel" there was a big ambient part added to the project. Not only raw depressive black metal but also atmospheric tracks without vocals and guitars can be heard from Garden of Grief. The style has continuously developed until the recording of the 4th album "Denied Sanctuary X", which was the first album including "old" songs that had been too hard to record in the beginning. Since then the style has developed to a mixture of elements in the vein of the old songs and newer aspects, adding a more aggressive edge to the songs that stand in contrast to the still melancholic lyrics and melodies. With the recording of the 5th full-length album "Endstation" this transition in style becomes clearly visible.

Garden of Grief is first of all a studio project. Live shows will be played under the right circumstances and if time and/or motivation permits.
