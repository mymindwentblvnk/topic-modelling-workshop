My Silent Wake's style could be described as Gothic death/doom metal, although it also includes more varied elements. Their influences are wide-ranging but predominantly include early Paradise Lost, My Dying Bride, Trouble, Celtic Frost and Black Sabbath.

Fans of these bands as well as Ian Arkley's other projects and even early Anathema will find plenty to enjoy.

Although sometimes associated with the 'Christian Metal' scene, (mostly because Ian Arkley played in Seventh Angel), My Silent Wake do not consider themselves a Christian band. Some lyrical themes deal with ideas of faith and loss of faith, but in deeply personal ways, and more universally, rather than the obvious Judeo/Christian religious themes.

Within the band there are members with different beliefs, including atheism, and later lyrical themes reflect this diversity.
