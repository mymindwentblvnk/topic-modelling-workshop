Vedervilja is black metal project from Norway, formed by P. (ex-Hypothermia (live)) in 2006. The project however has seemingly been inactive for most of its existence; only releasing a single demo in 2009 containing only one instrumental track. 

This release, simply called 'Rehearsal 28.03.09', was released on tape and limited to only 33 copies. Later, the project was put to rest.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vedervilja">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
