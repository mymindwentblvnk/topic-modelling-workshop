SpellBlast is an Italian power metal band from Bergamo which uses strong folk influences that also seize hold in the lyrical contents of the band. 

Heretofore, the band has released a promo CD called "Ray of Time" (2004), and their first full length album, "Horns of Silence" (2007). They might be compared to Elvenking by some, especially considering the fact that Elvenking's singer, Damnagoras, appears as a guest singer on a few tracks of the debut album.
