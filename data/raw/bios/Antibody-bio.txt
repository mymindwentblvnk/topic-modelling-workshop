There is more than one artist named Antibody.

1. Antibody are a queer sludgy doom band from Toronto, Canada. Themes of space, gender, and the abyss. 

2. French punk-Hardcore band with female vocals, a good sound quality, and political lyrics. Great live performances. Split up in 2005.

3. Antibody, comprised of Ed Wilson, J-mz Robinson, and Charles Horn, was a short-lived project which existed between late 2001 and the middle of 2003. Formed in Christchurch, New Zealand, Antibody was originally Wilson's idea, created as a group project with which to extend his solo investigations of musical intuition and automatism. However, Robinson and Horn's contributions soon transformed the band into something more genuinely collaborative. Wilson's departure overseas in 2003 brought an end to the project.

4. Antibody were an alternative rock band active in Brisbane, Australia from 1999-2002. Their first recording came in the form of a five-track EP entitled "Dim Reflections", which was released in 2000. This included the tracks "Waiting to Die", "Flashlight", "Rest", "Only When It Rains", and "Fleshtaxi".

Following this, they recorded several multi-track demos. The first of these was the garage sessions, which included the tracks "Distracted", "Untitled", "That's what you say", "The Thief Who Stole Bricks" and "Paths & Reasons". Their final release was a 3 track demo which included the single "Ceramic Girl", as well as "Beautiful Hunter" and "Courtesy of Strangers". Antibody played locally for several years before disbanding in late 2002.
