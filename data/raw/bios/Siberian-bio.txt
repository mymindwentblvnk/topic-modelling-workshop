There are multiple bands with the name Siberian.

1) Siberian is a heavy metal band from Link√∂ping, Sweden whose influences are drawn from the sludge and post-metal scene. Mix it together with their Scandinavian background and you will start to get an idea what Siberian is all about. Uncompromising walls of sound meets melody and melancholia. Post-metal inspired experimentation with sitars, flutes and bag-pipes. Faintest traces of atmospheric black-metal clashing with cranking moments of hardcore sludge. 

2) Siberian was formed in 2004 and composed of Finn Parnell (Singer/Guitar) Colin Wolberg (Guitar) Zach Tillman (Singer/Bass) and Aaron Benson (Drummer). The band gained a small local following in Washington. Releasing there first full EP, Hey Celestial! in early 2007 and following up with the release of there full album With Me later in the year. The band has subsequently broken up. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Siberian">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
