Obscenity is a Death Metal Band from Oldenburg in Germany. 
They play Florida-Style Death Metal.

Founded in 1989, Obscenity released their first two albums, Suffocated Truth (1992), and Perversion Mankind (1994) on very small labels, which couldn't bring them further. With a contract of the German "Morbid Records" Label they finally got known to an larger audience with the highly regarded 'The 3rd Chapter' (1996), which defined Obscenity's self-classified 'combination of the brutality of American bands and European virtuosity.' 

Ten years later in 2006, they quit the contract with Morbid Records.  Since their departure from Morbis Records they signed with Armageddon Records to record an album with.

Some Obscenity members founded a side-project called The Now Noise and Bassist Alexander Pahl also plays at Dew-Scented. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Obscenity">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
