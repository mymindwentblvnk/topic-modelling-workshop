Rapture Cabaret is a heavy metal band hailing from Wilmington, NC. Formed in 2004, the band underwent many member changes, evolving drastically into the sound they now have. Rapture Cabaret's style is a bit of a throwback to the old days of metal. Influenced by old thrash and Swedish death, the Cabaret has a dynamic style that is very unlike their contemporaries.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rapture+Cabaret">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
