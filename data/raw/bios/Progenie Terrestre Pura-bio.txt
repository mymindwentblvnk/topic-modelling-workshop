Progenie Terrestre Pura is a project born at the end of 2009 by the mental collision between Eon[0] and Nex[1]. Our purpose from the beginning was to combine Black Metal with electronic sounds and Ambient without stopping at the classic Black/Ambient combination, but trying to extend it by including more elaborate and layered electronic elements (an IDM approach and Psybient landscapes) capable of creating a new, different atmosphere in Black Metal music. Our musical vision leads us to pursue a constant evolution without losing sight of the root from which we come, but, however, avoiding to impose limitations on the composition and assembly of ideas.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Progenie+Terrestre+Pura">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
