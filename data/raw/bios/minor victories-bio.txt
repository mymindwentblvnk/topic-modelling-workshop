Minor Victories are a British alternative rock band formed in 2015. The band consists of vocalist Rachel Goswell (Slowdive), guitarists Stuart Braithwaite (Mogwai), Justin Lockey (Editors) and filmmaker James Lockey of Hand Held Cine Club.

The group was unveiled on social media in July, 2015 with the announcement of a forthcoming album including collaborations with other artists such as Mark Kozelek of Sun Kil Moon. A few days later a teaser trailer titled Film One was released featuring short clips of forthcoming songs. In a September, 2015 interview with website exclaim.ca, Braithwaite said that the band was working with producer Tony Doogan, that the album was "80% recorded," and that it would be released in early 2016. When asked about how the album would sound, he said "To be honest, I think if you know the music that all of us have made, it won't really surprise you. It has a lot of the good elements from everyone's bands." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Minor+Victories">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
