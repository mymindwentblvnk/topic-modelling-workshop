Sonically cradling you with deep and honest 80′s emotions, Swedish producer Johan Bengtsson’s alter ego Mitch Murder creates addictive retro synth masterpieces. As the story goes, Mitch is an overworked Wall Street I.T. from the 80′s who dreams at night other realities for himself. This is the soundtrack to his dreams.

Making 80s inspired electro house has become a trend of the days we live in. Johan has made it his goal to cut out the club music side and keep a true representation of 80s music and culture.

Born in Stockholm, Sweden in 1980, Johan grew up marvelling at the popular movies and tv-shows of the 80s, some of which would eventually serve as a seemingly never ending source of inspiration for his music later on.

Whether you're going for a late night run in the summer heat or speeding down city streets, Mitch has provided the perfect soundtrack to meet your needs.
