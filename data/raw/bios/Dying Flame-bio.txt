Dying Flame is a band from the north of the Netherlands. Starting off in late 2003, the band took their time to evolve into what they are now. They have recently been in the studio recording their first mcd which will be selftitled and is looking at a september 2008 release date.

The music can best be described as 'modern metal', as it features aspects from many different subgenres but has a modern sound to it. Comparisons can be found in bands such as Gojira, Lamb of God and Mastodon.

The current lineup consists of Kris Dev√©ria, Patrick Kunstman, Robert 'Oepi' Otten, Robert 'Munx' Graalman and Jeroen 'Pluisje' Schothorst.

On the 25th of May 2008 they put the first track off their upcoming mcd online on their myspace. It is called 'Jacob's Ladder'. Their myspace adres is:
