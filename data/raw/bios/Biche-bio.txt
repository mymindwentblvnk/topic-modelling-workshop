Biche is the new French pop sensation. That’s it. The kind of we had been happy to share with the world. The kind of we should select for the French contribution to the world great pop circus.

Biche (French word for “hind”), are 5 guys, talented, inspired, and probably funny as their videos could suggest. They came with “La Nuit des Perseides“, their first LP. If you have the chance to record pop songs, the jeweler’s ones, you might as well do it the right way.

It can take time to gather all the micro pieces, to add others, to rearrange them all to finally deliver precise and compact effort. And these guys seem to have accepted to take the time necessary to gather all their ideas (and they seem to have plenty), to pay attention to details, tiny things that will transform your raw initial idea to pocket masterpieces. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Biche">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
