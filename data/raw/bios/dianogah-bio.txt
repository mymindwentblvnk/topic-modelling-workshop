In their own words:

Jason, Kip and Jay have played together as Dianogah (pronounced Dye-ah-NO-gah) since January 1995. Previous music experience found Jay in the Chicago skronk-pop band Hubcap; Jason, in the long-lived Grover from Champaign, IL; and Kip performed in various groups, most notably as the touring drummer for The For Carnation. Dianogah's core instrumentation is as a trio of two bass guitarists and one drummer. They have toured the US extensively, traveled throughout Europe and played in South America. In their seven years as a band, Dianogah has toured with Man or Astro Man?, Blonde Redhead, Shellac, Silkworm, June of 44 and Don Caballero, and shared the stage with Sebadoh, Hum, The For Carnation, Ui, Rachels, Shipping News and Seam. When not touring in their critically acclaimed van, Jason, Jay and Kip enjoy playing floor hockey and telling funny stories about their cats. They also really enjoy sushi, books by Neal Stephenson or David Sedaris, clean socks, 'Krispy Kreme' donuts and the country of Italy. Sometimes, two or more members of the band accidentally wear the same t-shirt or the same type of shoes. And Jay never leaves home without "Duffel", his trusty tour bag. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dianogah">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
