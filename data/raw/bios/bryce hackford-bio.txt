Since 2007, Bryce Hackford has been making experimental recordings and collaborating with visual artists. One of his first recordings being the 27 minute electric guitar performance ‘Modern Propeller Music’. Constructed with guitar, effects and tape loops, it gets a re-release on new album Fair as a bonus track with another long-form soundscape ‘Run-On Cirrus.’

With releases as part of Behavior and Pearl Necklace, Bryce explored new ground in sampling to critical acclaim. Now on Fair, Bryce echoes the classic Detroit house of Moodymann and Theo Parrish, in his atomized formulation of electronica and dance. It’s hypnagogic dance and sampledelic music, mind altering and uplifting, inspired by the Brooklyn warehouse parties where Bryce has DJ’d for years. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bryce+Hackford">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
