Dick Annegarn is a Dutch singer/songwriter raised between the Hague and Paris, resulting in a unique combination of cultures in his music.  Typically singing in French, his accent is unusually guttural and is more pronounced than native French because of his upbringing.  The eerie "Coutances" off of the 1975 classic Mireille was used in Michel Gondry's independent film La Science des RÃ©ves (English The Science of Sleep.)  On Un' Ombre, Annegarn's inspiration was his take on gay life in a society that ostracizes homosexuals. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dick+Annegarn">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
