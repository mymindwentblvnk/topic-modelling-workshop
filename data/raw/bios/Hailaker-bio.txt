Seen by its current members as less of an artist or band than a fluid, open-ended project, Hailaker (hay-ull-ache-err)â€™s principal members and founders are Jemima Coulter and Ed Tullett (each solo musicians in their own right) who work between Bristol, Cardiff, and Oxfordshire. Contributing to the collective alongside Coulter and Tullett are the Portland, Oregon-based artist Mike Roth who handles artwork, and Ali Lacey of Novo Amor. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hailaker">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
