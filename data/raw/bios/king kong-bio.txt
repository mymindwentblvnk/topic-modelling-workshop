There is more than one artist with this name:

1) A Kentucky alternative rock band King Kong. From Louisville, Kentucky, formed in early 1989 by Ethan Buckler, the original bassist in the band Slint.

Over the course of its existence King Kong has been joined by Todd Hildreth (keys), Suki Anderson (add’l vocals), Amy Greenwood (add’l vocals), Andy Hurt (percussion), and Dave Pajo (drums). There are many others too numerous to list.
