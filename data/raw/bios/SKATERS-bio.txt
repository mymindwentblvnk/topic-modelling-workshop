SKATERS formed in late 2011 after Singer Michael Cummings and Noah Rubin (The Dead Trees, Adam Green, Little Joy) spent a year trading demos back and forth from Los Angeles to London with Guitarist Joshua Hubbard (The Paddingtons, Dirty Pretty Things). The three met in the middle to record an EP in a Manhattan loft, and never left the city. The result is a smart, dynamic punk record drawing inspiration from obscure genres and cultures. And, a live band featuring a rotating cast of young energetic musicians and veterans of the Boston and NYC music scenes. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Skaters">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
