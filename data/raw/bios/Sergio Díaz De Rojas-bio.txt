Though a player of a number of instruments, Sergio Díaz De Rojas is a pianist at heart, and composes music that reflects and comments on the way he views everyday life, while constantly working hard to incorporate different forms of art into his work. Gaining inspiration from old as well as new – his foremost musical influence being Keaton Henson – Sergio creates descriptive, nostalgic pieces that anyone could relate to.

With each composition a story of its own, Sergio hopes to help listeners see what he sees and to understand the one, true emotion that can be found (and felt) throughout all of his pieces – hope.

Sergio released his debut album, Unsaid Words, in 2015, and is currently working on a second album, alongside an array of other exciting projects, as well as maintaining his artists community, Piano & Coffee Co.
