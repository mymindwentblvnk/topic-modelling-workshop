Inearthed is the former name of Children Of Bodom. The band was called Inearthed from around 1993 to 1996. Alexi started the band with his friend Jaska W. Raatikainen, who still plays with Alexi in Children of Bodom. Inearthed recorded 3 demos, and on the demos there were changes in the line-up. On the 3rd demo, entitled "Shining" the line-up was the same that it was on Children of Bodom's debut album, "Something wild" except for the keyboard player.

Around 1996 or 1997 Inearthed recorded a full-length album, "Something wild", and even got a recording deal from a minor Belgian label. However the deal was not very good. After a while, the band got a better offer from Spinefarm records, and told the Belgian label that they had split up, while they actually only changed their name to "Children of Bodom" and sold the very same album they had recorded. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Inearthed">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
