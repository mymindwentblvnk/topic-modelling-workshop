Voracity is an Slamming Brutal Death Metal band  from Rivne, Ukraine

VORACITY was started in 2011 by three university friends who decided to bring some groovy sickness to their homescene. Since there were no slamming-style bands in our hometown, Rivne, it was rather good and fresh idea. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Voracity">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
