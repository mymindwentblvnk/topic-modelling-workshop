Lord Dying come from Portland, Oregon, a place over abundant with purveyors of the heavy riff. A region where the inhabitants are plagued with nerve and joint damage due to lack of sunlight. In a time where everyone is trying to out-sludge or out-doom each other Lord Dying gives something less than a fuck. They are a metal band with members of Black Elk , Portals, Le Force, and Cremains, who in their short, one years time as a band have shared the stage with Unsane, Red Fang, Yob, Valient Thorr, and others locally. They have also braved the west coast twice, the first time alone, only to meet up with crazy prog-shredmeisters Danava and heavy lust-lifers Lecherous Gaze for a few shows, followed a few months later by another co-headling tour with local heavy punishers Nether Regions. Shortly after Lord Dying teamed up with longtime brothers in crime Kelly and Erica G and solidified the first monumental release, Lord Dying “s/t", in 7” form on his Powerblaster Records label. In May/June of 2012 Lord Dying travelled coast to coast and played some shows as direct support for Black Cobra and Gaza to eventually meet with Witch Mountain and tour with them as direct support for several weeks. Lord Dying are hitting the road again late October to support Red Fang and Black Tusk for another U.S, tour. Lord Dying are here to pummel with heavy riffs and promote simpler things like Cold brew-Hot Shower. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lord+Dying">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
