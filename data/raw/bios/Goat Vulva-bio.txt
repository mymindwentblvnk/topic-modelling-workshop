Goat Vulva was a primitive black metal band from Finland that featured members of Beherit. Nuclear Holocausto Vengeance was quoted saying that Goat Vulva was only a booze project and he couldn't remember how many so-called demos were released, but they came in very limited quantities, perhaps 10 or 20 copies of each.
