David Wise (often also credited as Dave Wise) is a British video game music composer. He is one of the in-house composers at Rare, and his music appears in most of the Rare-developed titles. He started his career at Rare in 1985 and was the company's sole musician up until 1994. He is known for his atmospheric style of music, mixing natural environmental sounds and setting it to a tune.

Undoubtedly his most famous work is the soundtrack for Donkey Kong Country series of games, widely considered to be some of the best soundtracks to ever appear on SNES. Aside of the usual jolly "jungle" themes that fit to Donkey Kong's style in general, these games have a quite wide variety of different musical styles in different areas of the game. More recently, he's done the soundtrack for the Game Boy Advance port of Donkey Kong Country 3, and is working on a mystery Xbox 360 title.

Video game credits

(Please note: Although very few games prior to 1993 had credits, it is a known fact that David Wise was the only musician at Rare from 1985 to 1994, which effectively covers all of their NES and early SNES titles. Some very few games, such as Double Dare, did credit him.)
