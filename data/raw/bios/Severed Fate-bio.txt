The band was founded in high school with a guitar and drum partnership. After many different guises, with different band members, the core duo became Severed Fate when the current bass player joined some years later. The search for a singer was completed in 2010.

Their aim is to create heavy and equally ambient music that, whether fast or slow, brutal or melodic, or anything in between, evokes strong emotions and enjoyment for the listener and themselves.

2013 saw the band come out of hiding, performing at gigs around Manchester and self-releasing their debut album ‘Procrastinate’. This was shortly followed by the video single release for ‘Blind to Faith’ and they intend to keep the momentum going.

With no pre-requisites or expectations for fame or fortune Severed Fate just wish to stay true to themselves, the fans and the scene. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Severed+Fate">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
