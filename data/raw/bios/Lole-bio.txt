At the Paleo Festival, opening for Joe Cocker at the Arena in Geneva or Marianne Faithfull at the Cully Jazz Festival; Lole’s on-stage charm is winning over an ever-growing audience. Her last album, « Sugary and Dry », confirms her unique talent and desire to astonish.

In 2008, she will therefore be going back on the road in Switzerland and the rest of Europe, accompanied by the inspired Simon Gerber and backed by a wide array of electro-accoustic instruments. Within this new showcase, reinforced and reduced to the essential, Lole offers more than just a concert. A magical and intimate moment is created, combining sensitivity and surprise. »
