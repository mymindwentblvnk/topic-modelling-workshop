Split-up stoner/doom band from Auckland, New Zealand.

Laid back and grooving stoner/doom with both Black Sabbath and Sleep on their list of influences. Slightly psychedelic, but with their demo having cover artwork featuring pink skeletons, that is to be expected.

Discography: 2003: 'Army Of The Dead' (Demo)
