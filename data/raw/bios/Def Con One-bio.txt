DEF-CON-ONE are a metal band from Newcastle England. Def-Con-One was put together about ten years ago by Johnny and Antton who had played together in a previous band. From 1999 until 2009 Antton also played drums for black metal legends Venom. Finding any old musician to join would have been easy but finding people with the right attitude and drive was essential. Now that the band is complete we feel that the time is right to start showing the world what we do. We have built up quite a large following in the North East of England with our blend of Powerful Groove Crushing Metal. Filling Trillians rock bar in Newcastle many times. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Def+Con+One">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
