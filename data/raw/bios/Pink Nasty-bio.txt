Pink Nasty is Sara Beck, a folk singer reared in Wichita who now resides in Austin. Beck writes twangy acoustic folk tunes in the style of Neko Case, splitting her time between melancholy ballads and folky rockers in the vein of The Danny Pound. Her capable voice flirts with a southern drawl, but stays genuine enough so as to not induce groans. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Nasty">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
