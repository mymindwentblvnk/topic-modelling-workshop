There are multiple artists with this name:

1) Gothic is a metal band established in 1992 by Alin Petrut in the heart of the Carpathian Mountains of Transilvania, Romania, becoming in a short period of time one of the most respected metal bands in Romania. Having played in over 400 gigs so far, Gothic is a real metal force on stage, playing almost in all the occasions in full-house clubs in Romania.
Their debut album, "Touch of Eternity" (Bestial Records, 1998 ) was one of the best selling albums of the Romanian metal stage back in the '90s, songs like "Anguish", "Memorial Winter" or "Regrets" turning into real metal hymns. Metal Hammer gave a 9 (out of 10) reviewing this album.
Alin Petrut moved the band in Belgium between 2000-2004, and along with Belgian members released the second album "In Blood We Trust" in 2004 on Painkiller Records. The album was released under the name Innerfire, because another band with the name 'Gothic' existed in France at the time, and Painkiller didn't want any confusions.
Being expelled from Belgium due to his illegal situation, Alin Petrut reformed the band Gothic in Romania in 2005. To this occasion the anniversary auto-produced album "12 Years of True Metal" was released.

Between 2005-2011 the band extensively toured Eastern Europe, but the unfortunate line-up changes prevented the recording of a new album. Having now a stable line-up, the band entered Consonance Studio from Timisoara, Romania in July 2011. The recording of the new album "Expect The Worst" is finished, a new video is going to be released in the near future. The band is presently looking for a label to release this album.

In 2009, Alin Moise, one of the most talented Romanian guitarists, big winner of the national guitar contest 'Nationala de rock 2010', joined the band. 
In 2011 the band played in the finals of the Romanian national contest for WACKEN METAL BATTLE, among other 2 bands. At this time, in may 2012 Gothic won again the semifinals for WOA and will be playing in the Romanian finals for 2012.

Their music can be defined as a good combination of death metal with darker elements, all with excellent powerful guitar riffs. Loud rhythmic riffs are used mostly, and they are essential to add heaviness to the music because mere speed is not enough. There are three types of vocals. A death-metal one, a screaming type closer to black metal one, and a third one, more melodic. All of this gives a good combination of dark brutal vibes. The sound is concentrated especially on the guitars, which is essential to manifest all the power of the band.
The band has presently finished recording the new album "Expect the Worst" which is due to be released in 2012.
