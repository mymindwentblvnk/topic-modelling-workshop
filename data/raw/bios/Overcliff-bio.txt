Overcliff is a band of Hellenic origin, which was initially formed by guitarist George Sarantinos who created the band in 2011. The first line-up of the band consisted of Adrian Kokosis and George Sarantinos on guitars, XII on bass, Leliel Clades on drums and Nicholas Hadjiadonas on vocals. During 2011 and 2012, the band performed in several venues. Meanwhile, they stepped into the studio to record their first EP. This Ep would never see an official release due to internal conflicts and a general sense of dissatisfaction with the material. Nicholas left the band so as to fully commit to his studies, and by the 2013, Overcliff experimented as an instrumental band, which signaled their departure from traditional song structures and vocal-centric compositions. In 2014, Mora Hecate joins the band as a clean singer, in an attempt to enrich the melodic aspects of the band's material. In early 2015, Mora leaves the band because of many differences in the way the musical core of the band was envisioned, and soon after she is replaced by Magnus Amon Peccator. Seeing the band's musical and lyrical ideas flourished with the sense of purpose Magnus brought with his arrival, he became an official member on September of 2015, and with the role of the vocalist covered, the band entered the studio once more to record the album "Depiction of Intimacy". The recordings lasted from winter of 2016 up until the early summer. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Overcliff">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
