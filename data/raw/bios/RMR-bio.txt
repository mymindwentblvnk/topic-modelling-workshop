Very little is known about RMR (pronounced "rumor"), the ski-mask wearing crooner. What is known, according to an interview he gave with Rolling Stone, is that he is 23, and grew up between the Buckhead district of Atlanta and Inglewood, Los Angeles.

RMR exploded onto the scene in late February 2020 with his debut track "RASCAL,‚Äù a cover of Rascal Flatts' "Bless the Broken Road." The altered lyrics and accompanying music video subvert the country classic, with all the gun-toting, designer flexing, and police-aggression one might expect from a modern trap banger.

Based on the success of RASCAL, in April 2020 RMR inked a deal with Warner and CMNTY RCRDS and promptly released a follow-up record: "DEALER."

RMR appears to deliberately eschew genre classification, listing influences ranging from country and rock artists such as Rascal Flatts, John Mayer and Blink-182 to iconic rappers like Kanye West, Jay-Z and Drake.

According to RMR, the ski mask goes beyond just an aesthetic choice. He wishes to remain anonymous as long as he can. In an April 2020 interview with Variety he expanded on this, claiming: "I want people to listen with their ears, not their eyes."

On June 12, 2020, RMR released his debut EP DRUG DEALING IS A LOST ART. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/RMR">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
