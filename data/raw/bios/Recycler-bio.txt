Since the launch of their first explosive album ‘AlphbhangraPsychedelicFunk’ (Nation records 1999), Recycler also released ‘Iboga’ (2003, before being signed to Kube Recordings in 2006. Having witnessed their incredible live act and on hearing a demo, it was too much for Kube to resist.  In mid 2007 their third album Massa Boom Boom has been released on digital format:– This Money Shot EP takes 3 songs from the album and twists them into dark, filthy, psychedelic shapes giving dirty dancing its true meaning. From the heavy bass, strong African rhythms and warped vocals of “5 minutes of free pornography (Klub mix)” to the rich lush eastern flavoured dub of Besh Atli, and the explosive electronic beats and samples on Dancing Feet (écorché mix). For the purists you can get all the original tracks on Recycler’s Massa Boom Boom.
