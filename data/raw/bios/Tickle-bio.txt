First of all, there is more than one band with this name. The description beneath is for the band TICKLE, based in ARAD, ROMANIA. their website is also posted lower. 



Each of them has played music, individually. On the 24th of May 2006, being students at the School Of Arts, in Arad, Romania, they met to take our final exams. 
Even so, without much serious thought in mind, they considered it necessary to have a name.
They chose "Tickle" because of a movie that they had seen(Garden State). In the past year in which the group has existed, there have been some members coming and going, but the present members of the group are:


BrÄƒdean Andrei (voice, guitar)
Dragomir Bogdan (solo guitar)
Petrasciuc Claudiu (bass guitar)
Mittelbrun Cristian (keyboards)
