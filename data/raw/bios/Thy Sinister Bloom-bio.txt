In 1992 a melancholy inspired a music, and so Thy Sinister Bloom drew it’s first breath. The romance and muse lasted for several years and produced a well received demo tape, a heavily traded promo cassette & finally a mythical unreleased 3 track EP. Alas, after years of promise, the music had reached its closing symphony and 1998 was our final curtain call, as we individually followed paths afar… An unfinished legacy had been cast in stone… Just as the dust seemed settled, fate played its strongest hand and 2007 placed three of the original line-up on the same soil once again. As like before, many moons back, the melancholy, the music, all returned and breathed a new life. So we now endeavor to share new music, vast in scale, consistent with the modern musical climate, yet also hinting at pastures of old… But most importantly, all enshrouded in a veil of somber ambience.
