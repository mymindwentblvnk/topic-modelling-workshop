The raging fire that is burning in the south of England is now burning stronger than ever. Frosthold have awoken with their new conception of Anglo-Saxon inspired heavy metal.

Having just released their first full E.P entitled When Brothers Fought In Arms, the five-piece are hard at work rehearsing and planning to do gigs across the country.

Frosthold is a five-piece heavy metal band consiting of James (Vocals), Phil (Guitar), Chris (Guitar), Joss (Bass) and Tom (Drums). The project began in mid 2004 when James and Tom left their old band, and joined forces with friends Phil and Joss to effectuate their doctrine concerning the Dark Ages, or the time when the Anglo-Saxons ruled over England. By using inspiration from things they have learnt about the Dark Ages, heathen gods and goddesses, and the lifestyle of these times, they weld together their own mixture of metal in their own pithy manner.

Their first major gig was at the inaugural Total Carnage Festival in August 2004, and having played a reasonable number of gigs (including London, Portsmouth, Winchester, Southampton and Bournemouth) since then have gained the gig experience required to put on an amazing live show, full of character, spirit and, of course, a feel of the heathen times long lost to England. In 2007, Chris Wagg rejoined the band to complete the current line-up.

Frosthold have played with bands such as Cannibal Corpse, Cradle of Filth, Desecration, Hecate Enthroned, Cruel Humanity, Diamanthian, Nailed, Soulfracture, Hanzel und Gretyl, and many more. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Frosthold">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
