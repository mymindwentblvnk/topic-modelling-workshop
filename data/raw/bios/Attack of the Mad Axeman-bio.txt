After the mad axeman destroyed the forest, some animals decided to get back and take charge of their destiny. There was only one way to express their anger about what had happened: playing harsh Grindcore. So, they left their homes to destroy the ears of humans, but also build awareness amongst the humans of what the animals had been through.

Attack of the Mad Axeman is an attempt to deconstruct species boundary; not only between humans and animals, but also within the animal kingdom: a snail on drums, a bee on bass, a growling turtle on vocals, and after the raccoon left, squirrel on guitar. 

We are animals with very different backgrounds, you may think, but we found a way to work together. And we want you to join us! It doesn't matter if you have two, four, six, eight, or even a thousand legs. It's not important weather you prefer punishing blastbeats, hard hitting guitars, exploding bass, or bonerattling vocals - we use these instruments weapons to fight ignorance, injustice, and mad axemen everywhere!
