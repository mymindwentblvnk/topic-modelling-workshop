Yuka Honda (本田ゆか) is a multi-instrumentalist and co-founder of the band Cibo Matto. Throughout her career, she has been collaborating with a diverse array of musicians, including Petra Haden, Sean Lennon, Medeski Martin & Wood, Luscious Jackson, and Caetano Veloso.

Honda is originally from Tokyo, Japan, but moved to New York City in the 1980s. Living there, she eventually met Miho Hatori and worked in the band Leitoh Lychee. This band was later replaced by Cibo Matto. She was romantically linked with Sean Lennon for a while and produced his 1998 album Into the Sun. The two met during a collaboration between Yoko Ono and Cibo Matto. Her work since the breakup of Cibo Matto seems to be concentrated more in the downtown New York scene, working with musicians such as Dave Douglas, Susie Ibarra, Vincent Gallo, Trevor Dunn, and John Zorn, whose label Honda recorded her two solo albums for (Tzadik). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Yuka+Honda">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
