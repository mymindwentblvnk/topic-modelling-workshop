TANK86 delivers mighty sonic blows, never losing sight of the almighty riff, pounding you into oblivion.
 
TANK86 released their debut album ‘Rise’ in 2011, which was well received by critics and fans all over the globe. Harmonised guitars, a layered approach and guest appearances by Peter van Elderen (Peter Pan Speedrock) and Tommi Holappa (Dozer / Greenleaf) add true depth to the massive sound of this instrumental band. TANK86 has toured Europe with Dozer and stood its ground alongside bands such as Monster Magnet, Pelican, Karma to Burn and Valient Thorr.
