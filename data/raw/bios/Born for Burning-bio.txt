There's two metal bands called Born For Burning. A Swedish black metal band and an Australian doom metal one-man project.


The Swedish band formed in 2012 with intentions to create a tribute to early Bathory. Members are known from successful Swedish bands like Unanimated. They've released a self-titled 7" EP in 2014 on Critical Mass recordings. 

The Australian project was created in 2010 by prolific Pahl Hodgson (Johnny Touch/Beyond Mortal Dreams) in the stylings of traditional Doom/Heavy Metal. So far he's released one demo tape called Woeful Souls on Sarlacc productions, 2012. He's still active. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Born+For+Burning">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
