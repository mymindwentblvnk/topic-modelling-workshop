As one half of the experimental electronic duo Hype Williams and as a solo artist, the musician formerly known as Inga Copeland has resisted easily legible narratives at every turn. She's said little about herself in the few interviews she’s given, and her music tends to confound most of the expectations a listener might bring to it. Her latest full-length release, The Smoke, centers Lolina’s singing voice more than her solo debut, Because I’m Worth It, but that doesn’t make it any easier to grasp. Where the human voice often asks listeners to identify with the person behind it, Lolina’s only deepens the sense of bewilderment that her music often provokes. Listening to The Smoke is like hearing a voice trying to locate itself in an unstable environment, rubbing up against strange synth textures, asymmetrical beats, and jagged melodic phrases. Like her contemporaries Klein, Mhysa, and Jenny Hval, Lolina challenges ingrained assumptions about what songs are and what they can do, dragging her listeners through an exhilarating funhouse of sound. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lolina">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
