Musaka is a Bosnian death/doom metal band formed in 2001 in the city of Banja Luka by Boris Todorović (guitar, programming, keyboards), Davorin Turajlić (guitar, vocals), Milan Novaković (bass, lead vocals) and Srđan Karalić (drums), albeit at that time it was just a band that played covers and had only one real rehearsal due to lack of their own musical equipment and practice rooms. Boris left Bosnia in 2002 and continued making music under the name Musaka on his own. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Musaka">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
