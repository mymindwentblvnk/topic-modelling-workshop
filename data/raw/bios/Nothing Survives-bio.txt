Nothing Survives hails from the Blackfeet Reservation in a town called Browning. The three core members; Louie, Vaylon, and Emerald; have been together ever since it's foundation in 2002. In 2007 they added Eddie as a vocalist temporarily at first, but made him a full time member of the band a few months later. They have played in a variety of venues and cities in Montana, and hope to continue on throughout the rest of the year. It is hard to describe or even understand the sound of Nothing Survives by listening to just one song or classifying it under one genre. Since everyone is all about labels though, Nothing Survives' would probably be classified as Eccentric Progressive Metal. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nothing+Survives">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
