KLV (abbreviated from the original name, Kehitysvammaisen Lapsen Vanhemmat, meaning "The Parents of a Deficient Child") was a band formed by Sami Hynninen and Jari Pohjonen, who are better known as Albert Witchfinder and Earl of Void of Reverend Bizarre, respectively.

KLV started as a noisecore project, but later their music developed into experimental gothic/doom oriented material. Besides obscure demos, they released only a 7" split with Viikate during their existence. Their side of the split, alongside with selected demo material, was released in 2008 on a compilation entitled Niin musta on maa. A CD-R compilation from the band's noisecore era is planned. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/KLV">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
