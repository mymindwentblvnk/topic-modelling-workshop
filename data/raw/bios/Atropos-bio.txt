There is more than one artist with the name Atropos:

1). Atropos is a Melodic Black Metal band from France - founded in 1998. They had two releases, one of which is a demo entitled "...La Fileuse de Mort..." and an EP entitled "Creature Chthonienne". The band was signed on Oupiric Productions before, they split up. The sound is described as a Neo-Classical-influences in guitar and traditional French style of high technical band dynamic interludes similar to Deathspell Omega and Blut aus Nord but, they have a much more Melodic toich. Due to the poor quality, they have failed to keep up with the band and unfortunately no record lablels have seeked to remaster their EPs.

4). Atropos is a Norwegian metalcore band from Stavanger. Atropos started when Anders hooked up with Eivind. They played for a year or two, before Arnt Gunnar joined them. Arnt wore a cool t-shirt at one of Anders classes, and they started to talk. That is how Atropos became a band of three. A bass player was needed, so Bent Magne joined the band. He was a friend of Eivind. Bent played for a year and a half, before Atropos got a new bass player. His name was Jan Morten. Atropos needed a vocalist to complete the lineup, and after years of searching they finally found their vocalist, Martin.

Atropos has only played local gigs, but theyâ€™re now looking for gigs outside their region.
