American Heavy Metal band from Cincinnati,Oh (USA). 

Formed in 1986, it has released six albums, including a live one and a best of compilation.

The dual guitar assault by Josef Sunderhaus and Lou Vaughn along with the audible lyrics of Matt Roth backed by Steve Hamons on Bass and Dale Bachovin on Drums quickly made Krankenstein international favorites among the purists that still stands the test of time. 

"An all out sensory assault (with) jackhammer riffs fuel(ing) the ring of vocal fire like a thrashing ocean of molten emotion" according to HiJinx Magazine (1991) “Krankenstein's live show is brutally aggressive, both onstage and in the pit.” - River City Rocks (1992)

The bands debut album in 1989 (One Foot in the Grave) helped establish the band as force to be reckoned with, not only in the US, but overseas as well. Their second release in 1992 (Krush, Kill, Destroy) quickly gained the band international recognition at a time that grunge was taking over the airwaves in America. 'Theozoology' came out in 1997 with the bands final studio release coming out in 2000 (Dirt Nap). A Live disc and compilation disc followed as the band took time off to spend with friends and family.

Often compared to Exodus, Pantera, Megadeth, and early Metallica, Josef Sunderhaus (Guitarist and founding member) along with Matt Roth (Vocals & founding member) endured years of touring and recording with numerous lineup changes but never lost focus on the hard hitting musical onslaught. Recently regrouping along with Joe Morris on 2nd lead, Steve Hamons on Bass, and Scott Berger on drums, Krankenstein is set to reclaim its rightful place in heavy metal history with a new tour and possible album in 2012.
