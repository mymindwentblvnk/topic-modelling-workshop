Cuushe is a Japanese artist from Kyoto, Japan. She released her debut album, Red Rocket Telepathy, in 2009 on the Japanese indie label, flau. She has toured with Grouper in Japan and performed in Australia, Europe, and Asia with different artists, including label-mates cokiyu and aus. She composes pop-infused electronic music influenced by dream pop and ambient. With her delicate lyrics, the multi-talented Cuushe beautifully projects a subtle musical world that is carefully wrapped with sensitive emotion and fragile memories. Her EP Girl You Know That I Am Here But The Dream featured Julia Holter, artwork by Rachel Evans (Motion Sickness Of Time Travel) and mastering by Miles Whitaker (Demdike Stare/Pendle Coven).
