1. Lurker Luxembourg (founded 2008)

Unfortunately Lurker has broken up. After our drummer left the band this summer to study we were unable to find a replacement good enough to satisfy our needs.

After that the motivation was gone so we see no purpose in keeping that project alive.

We would like to take this opportunity to thank all the Bands we played with and of course all the people who came to our shows. Thank you so much for the support you gave us over the year.

Farewell

-Lurker-
