„Darkest Horizon invites you on a cinematic journey of timeless melodies paired with modern metal-tunes. The idea of combining monumental symphonic sounds with melodic death metal is the characteristic force behind the band and distinguishes them from generic pabulum.”
(Orkus Magazine, October 2012)

„Melodic Death Metal that you‘re going to enjoy from the first to the last note. Those who love music somewhere between Children Of Bodom and Ensiferum, should follow Darkest Horizon. It’s worth your while!”
(Metal Hammer, December 2011)

Since the band’s foundation in 2010, Darkest Horizon was positively received from various magazines and webzines. Without any down-time, the band is eagerly working on a large number of innovative songs. The highly acclaimed EP “Shattered Skies” was released in early 2011 and was the starting shot for many headlining-gigs in local concert halls as well as big festivals like the Metalfest Open Airs.

In late 2011 Darkest Horizon drew the attention of Cubeaudio who worked with big names like In Flames and Guano Apes. Since then the band is cooperating closely with Cubeaudio and other excellent studios to record further songs, showing even more facets of their music (including the band’s clean vocal ballad “The Final Hours” and nearly 8 minute long epics).

Sponsors and supporters like VirusMusik, Bembel With Care and Darkest Horizon’s own sound and lighting engineers are providing the band with all requirements for an epic live performance.

The second EP “Scattered Worlds” was released in early 2013. Committed to the cause, Darkest Horizon was playing at numerous big festivals and is confirmed to enter the stage of 2013’s festivals.
