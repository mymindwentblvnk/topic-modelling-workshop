There are some dream collaborations that you would probably sell your granny for, or at least her thimble and china elephant collection, but who could have imagined a marriage between old grade school classmates.  The 12 inch release, comprising only two tracks, is a conflation of Britain's most eminent and prolific electronic artists Four Tet and Burial.  'Wolf Cub' is comprised of a beautiful tribal rhythm that is reminiscent of two-step garage.  Yet instead of the paranoid urban hiss, crackle, and ghostly atmospherics of Burial's production, the majority of this tune's body resembles Hebden's finest work-- that chiming, cascading kaleidoscopic wall of SOUND that builds beyond control.  The second track, 'Moth,' adds a nice contrast.  The beat is subdued throughout and has a house-y TR-808 sound that feels familiar.  But unlike generic house music, 'Moth' is dynamic: a haunting synth melody rolls over sprinkling chinks, chimes, atmospheric and urban noise as a spectral female voice echoes into space.  To listeners familiar with the two collaborators, 'Moth' resembles Burial's previous work, while 'Wolf Club' contains earmarks from Hebden's solo endeavors. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Burial+&+Four+Tet">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
