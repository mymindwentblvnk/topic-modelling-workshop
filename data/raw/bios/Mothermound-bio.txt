Mothermound, the obscure bunch from Tolmin, Slovenia.

The group’s origins reach way back into 1995 when they were active as a trio under the name of Expulsion. Until their disbandment in 2005 they released two demo recordings and an album entitled ‘In These Glorious Epitaphs’. They reunited in a new line-up in 2009, this time as a four piece with a new name. Music-wise they continue to stick to the previously set guidelines, a sort of progressive mixture of doom and death metal with a hint of rock’n’roll. 

Mothermound is: Martin Čujec – Drums, Miha Jukič – Guitar, Tomaž Orač – Guitar, Janez Zega – Bass/Vocals
