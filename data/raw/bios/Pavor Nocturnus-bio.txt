There is more than one artist with this name.

1) Italian dark ambient project. Released a split vinyl named "L'Alfiere" with Camerata Mediolanense.

2) Italian metal band. The Pavor Nocturnus project was founded back in 2005 by the minds of Stefano “Yog Sothoth” Marina and Diego “Aeternus” Tasciotti, who got in touch thanks to Stefano’s band “Engelstein”, the official Italian Rammstein’s tribute band. With a passion in common for Arcturus, Red Harvest and Fear factory, they decided to found a project where modern metal riffs where combined with modern electronic sounds, not limiting only to industrial, but also drum’n’bass, ebm, ambient, techno, etc. In 2006, after some line-up changes, Andrea “Aerioch” Di Nino entered the band as a bassist. His former experience with symphonic black metal band “Tyrants” brought a melodic shade to PN sound. In 2007, Andrea “Seth 666” Taddei was introduced as the new guitarist by Stefano, after their former experience with “Slask”, an electro-stoner project. PN riffs became more incisive and aggressive, thanks to his extreme metal influences. Also in December of 2007 came out the first “Demo”, containing two songs, an intro and an outro. The demo was recorded in Stefano’s private studio and was intended for a musician audience, as we were still looking for a good, flexible vocalist. In 2008, Alexander joined the band. In the next three months the previous songs were re-written to better suit his voice; new songs also came out. In the end of June the band entered 16th cellar floor studio in Rome to record “Diazepam”, their second demo. As by now the band is working on refining their songs for a new album and for future live experiences.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pavor+Nocturnus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
