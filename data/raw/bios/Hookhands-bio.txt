Hookhands is New England crossover thrash band started by Tommy Lee (For The Worse), Adam Hill (The Hour), and Chris Vickery. They sound like a cross between Agnostic Front and Nuclear Assault, with some Kreator and Slayer thrown in for good measure. In April 2010, they released their debut album "The Dead Hate The Living". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/HookHands">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
