Memphis's Snowglobe plays an entrancing blend of cosmic American music that owes as much to pioneering psychedelic country/pop legends like the Byrds and Gram Parsons as it does to modern-day fellow travelers like the Flaming Lips. Having played together since high school, the members of snowglobe have a unique ability create complex songs with a rich pallet of sounds in a seemingly nonchalant way. The Memphis based band continues the long lasting tradition of playing honest music for the right reasons. Many comparisons to Neutral Milk Hotel, and Elephant 6 recording company have been made to Snowglobe, and as natural as that comparison seems, it seems to be an easy way out, but Snowglobe has advanced far beyond this. Snowglobe sounds like Mercury Rev, the piano balladry of Tim Hardin, early 70s Beach Boys, and the Kinks. Snowglobe is a band that takes from past genres and pushes those influences as step or two forward. This is a very song oriented band. The noises and kitchen sink extremities arent thrown in nonchalantly, they are precise and subtle flourishes that add texture.
