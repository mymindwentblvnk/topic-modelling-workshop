THE EMBRACED was formed back in 1997 in Trondheim, Norway. The bands sound in a way was particular, as for a while they were the only Death Metal band from Norway, sounding "swedish", which at the time was not a bad choice for the band, as they certainly got some attention for being somewhat special.

The debut album "In My Dreams... I Am Armageddon" surfaced in 1997, proving a skilled band with a sound of their own, and a attitude as well.
Things from here took time, and it wasn't until 2001 the follow-up "The Birth" was ready. More technical and intricate than the usual band around, but one could still hear the core of the band.

From here things went downhill, bandmembers quitting with music alltogether, stand-ins coming and going, and although the band after the album did some of their most remarkable liveperformances, it was not enough to keep the band together, and it ended with a break that has lasted until recently.

The band has started to work on new material, seven pre-productions are made, and if everything goes as planned, a new album should be recorded in 2009...
