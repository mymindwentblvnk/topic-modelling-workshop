The blown project from the beginning 1998 was founded like "dark sight" of one musician.Nebelheim recorded in this era two demos and realized two gigs in 1999.History is captured on two Vhs videos too - one concert from Benatky in Ostrava 1999 and recording first demo in Bombjack studio.There were two guests on both demos.Viking played guitar on "Jako Skarn" and Navar played Epilogue.Ulfr and Navar realized both concerts too and all of them had met in
Ritual band before.
Ulfr has stopped all of his music project with the turn of the millennium.Main reason was study of music theory and composition for it but due to one guy Frost from Hassgesang zine was realized both demos on CD-R in 2003 only for reviews...
and Nebelheim drifted away...
The second era begun in 2008 but the true is that one-man band can not fall apart. 

Albums:

2011 a Shadow
2003 Epilogue/Jako Skarn... both demos
1999 Epilogue unreleased
1998 Jako Skarn...demo issued Ravenheart production
