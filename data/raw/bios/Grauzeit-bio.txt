Grauzeit was founded in early 2010 by Norgarth and M.F.
After several lineup-changes it manifested itself with Norgarth and Argwohn in 2012.
They released a Tape with the single "Mein Leben endet..." which came out in late 2011 and a Demo-EP called "Dieses Gef√ºhl jeden Tag" in early 2012 which is 
available as free download on their Bandcamp-Page.
In spring 2012 the band recorded their new EP "Tyrannei der Tristesse" which is meant to be released in 2013.
The music of Grauzeit is melancholic Metal with several influences from all kinds of music.
