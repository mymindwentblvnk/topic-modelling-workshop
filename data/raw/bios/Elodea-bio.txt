Elodea is a four-piece from Slovenia using their music and ideas as a reflection on decaying world, its culture and sickened humanity. Their roots go back in 1999, but shortly 3 years of silence followed. The hiatus brought a new line-up and let the musical course into something far more sinister. Call it hardcore, sludge, doom, whatever... The song writing grows and develops within frames of dimness and depression, though there's still plenty of room for beauty and emotions... <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Elodea">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
