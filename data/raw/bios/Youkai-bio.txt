Youkai originally formed under the name ButtVag in the year 2006. Playing mostly Anal Cunt worship Grindcore in the beginning, around 2007/2008 Evil Lolicon began recording again. But instead of just Grindcore, the music, went into a more Death Metal/Grindcore/Noise sound and thus shaped what ButtVag was and Youkai is today. With vocals mostly containing incoherent screaming the lyrical content is mostly satyrical, racist, misogynistic, & offensive. As of July 2009 Evil Lolikon uses a Laptop for live shows instead of members.
