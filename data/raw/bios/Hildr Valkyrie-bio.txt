Hildr Valkyrie is a one woman band coming from Hellas. Started in 2003 and exists till nowadays. H.V. has not many releases herself, but has done a lot of collaborations with many bands worldwide. H.V. also is a member of Folkearth (from the second album) and Folkodia.

Back in the year of 2003...
 After long time of pointless tries with other bands Hildr Valkyrie decided to create her own one-woman band and so, from the imagination the band took "flesh and bones".
  
In 2004...
 Hildr Valkyrie started to work on her own material and released her first solo album. The self-financed CD "Deceitful Fate" featuring 9 tracks and 1 cover from Falkenbach, which received many good reviews worldwide. 
Epic tunes and angelic vocals were the result of Hildr's inspiration. This combination was never performed by any other band from Hellas-Greece.

In 2005...
 Hildr Valkyrie started working on her second CDemo "To Walhall Shall Meet", but was not that happy with the initial result, especially with the guitar sound as the second CDemo was about  to be even more metal than the first one. Guitarist Alboin worked with her, as a session guitarist player and the new CDemo was re-recorded from the very beginning with better results... CDemo "To Walhall Shall Meet" was never released, except by rough versions of it on the Internet. 

During 2006...
 Being inspired by the music of Falkenbach, Hildr Valkyrie paid homage to this one-man band and made a cover (with the help of Alboin on guitars) which appeared on "An Homage to Falkenbach" with the song "The Heralder" from the LP Version of "En Their Medh Riki Fara" Album and was released by Skaldic Art Prod.  
In this year become a member of Folkearth releasing in August the first album with them and the second for the band  called "By The Sword Of My Father" which played key parts, female vocals and wrote the music for the song "Returne to Waelhalle".
Also become a session female vocalist of Uruk Hai (Aut) and released the album Lothlorien (Othal Productions) in December.

In May of 2007...
  "Drakkars In The Mist" (Stygian Crypt Productions) album was released from Folkearth with the participation of Hildr Valkyrie on Female Vocals, Keys and Drum programing at the track "De Tause Fjel". In August got proposal to join Folkodia.
In July Hildr joined Voluspaa, a one-man band from Norway as a session vocalist for his  mcd "En Tid Tilbake". 
Later on Hildr took part to the Compilation of V/A "Celtiberia War Vol.1" with one track from the CDemo "Deceitful Fate".

In 2008...
  Hildr Valkyrie with the help on guitars from Alboin -Germany- and Aled Pashley -Wales- released the first bands CD with the title "Shield Brothers Of Valhalla" from Stygian Crypt. Thanos -Hellas- recorded his special vocals for the track "To Walhall Shall Meet". The album features 8 tracks plus 2 covers which are Falkenbach's Havamal and Bathory's Ring of Gold. 
"As result we have new good stuff into Viking style. Here isn't standard Viking metal, because here aren't tons of guitar riffs and chaotic drumming, but here are just folkloric melodies with ambient touches..."
