Diggeth are from The Netherlands and a band worth watching out for. Although the sound is typically Stoner like, there are some moments which are directly influenced by Thrash Metal. Think of it as a kind of stoner rock with a mid-tempo flair of melodic thrash. In other words, it reminds of Metallica (in the vocals) and Black Sabbath (in the guitars). If youâ€™re a fan of C.O.C or Orange Goblin, then this is a band that you need to track down.  http://www.diggeth.com
