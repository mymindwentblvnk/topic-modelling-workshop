19. Gothic/Visual/Symphonic Black Metal

The idea of Abaddon was started on 06/06/2006 under the name XiV-XviiJ, as a gothic medieval atmospherical project. The members were XiV; and XviiJ, currently known as Ayakashi, and Karael (active from 2004 to present day)
Their works were never publicly published under the name XiV-XviiJ being that they wanted to make a personal gateway, and simply did not care to be noterized.
In 2006 and again in 2008 their works were used in various artist albums as Intros and atmospherical midways. Their works also appear in several obscure movies. They've always remained anonymous or used pseudonyms

Ayakashi has also created under another name many of the gothic castle/graveyard/creepy forest pictures you can find on the internet and people use on a daily basis, but has never received any credit for these images.

In 2011 they changed the name to Abaddon, and Zakai joined the project.
They have also had a certain evolution in the idea, the sound will now be Gothic/Symphonic Black Metal. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Abaddon">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
