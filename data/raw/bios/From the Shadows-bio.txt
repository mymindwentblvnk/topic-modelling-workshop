From The Shadows (Lima, OH)

Hailing from Lima, OH. From The Shadows is a project entirely created by myself, James Worley II. I always wanted to make music truly passionate, meaningful all by using the many extreme genres of metal and balancing them together to create a unique style of melodic death metal.

I've been involved in alot of metal projects around here and I feel that From The Shadows is undoubtedly the best yet. I spent the time to not only get the production as sharp as possible but to get the vocals as tight and intelligent as I possibly could. From death growls to screams, shouts and yes, even singing, this album has it all.

...and so is From The Shadows. Releasing the debut full length LP "Archives of Desolation" I plan to promote this album for several months, as I hope not only people locally will hear what I've been working on, but world-wide too. Thanks for checking this project out, I will be updating this page quite often!
