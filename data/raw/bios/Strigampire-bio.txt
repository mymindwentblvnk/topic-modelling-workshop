Strigampire is a melodic death metal band from Quebec (Canada) that creates an unique blend of aggressivity, bitterness and power. Formed in 2001, the band constantly got recognized throughout the years, thanks to the members' eloquence, and the amount of energy released at their frantic live performances. Their intensity gave them the opportunity of opening for great acts such as Krisiun, Quo Vadis, Belphegor, Martyr and Anonymus among others. Stronger than ever, Strigampire are now ready to conquer foreign masses with their first release "Where Torments Drown", a powerful album where melancholy meets rage, through catchy melodies and relentless rhythmics. "Where Torments Drown" is an impeccable production of Jef Fortin (Neuraxis, The Last Felony, Aeternam). For the fans of strong sensations and/or Arch Enemy, Children Of Bodom, Guns 'n Roses, At The Gates, Ozzy Osbourne, etc.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Strigampire">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
