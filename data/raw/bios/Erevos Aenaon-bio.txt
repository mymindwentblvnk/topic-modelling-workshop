"Erevos Aenaon" is anciend greek for "darkness eternal",and thats the main feeling the band wants to express through their music.Chaos and Erevos were always there,before all creation,creation itself emerged from chaos and erevos,those two alone are eternal and everlasting.They still surround our kosmos,and they will be there long after it's end. Untouched by the decade of time,even the strongest of light cannot diminish erevos.The vastness of darkness prevailing against the light,and death against life,both literaly and metaphoricly is their concept.Stronger than any faith and religion. The band was founded in 2001. Demo will soon come out.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Erevos+Aenaon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
