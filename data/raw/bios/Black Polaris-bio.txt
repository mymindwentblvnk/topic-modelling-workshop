Black Polaris, hailing from Royston, Hertfordshire and Biggleswade, Bedfordshire, playing a combination of Melodic Death metal along with a lot of modern influences. Having been booked with bands including Eternal Lord, This Is Colour, Random Conflict, Annotations Of An Autopsy, Devil Sold His Soul, Seven Year Kismet and Sanctorum and more, Black Polaris have quickly made their mark on the British underground metal scene. After finishing their album, Black Polaris had high hopes for a successful release, however after problems with their Ex- Label “Fallen Empire Records” Black Polaris are once again on their own but are still optimistic with help from their latest management. More details on their album will be announced soon.
