1.) Yvette (born Yvette Zani) is a Brazilian bossa nova/MPB singer active from 1965 to the late 70s. She released a number of solo albums and singles including duets with Edu Lobo and Eduardo Conde. She's probably best known for her funky version of Upa Neguinho on Discos Marcus Pereira.

2.) YVETTE (2009 - present) is an experimental noise rock band from Brooklyn, New York.  

"YVETTE  are the hard-edged, ultraviolent, spooktacular response to years of the fluttery squish of Animal Collective and HEALTH. Built on the barely legible guitars of Noah Kardos-Fein and the heavily effected drums of Bloomington transplant Rick Daniel, Yvette use the powers of distortion and flange for evil instead of good. Their debut 7" (hand screen-printed, limited to 350) is four songs that turn the noise-clatter of This Heat and the drummier brumble of mid-'00s Liars into a near-industrial churn. Side-B opener 'With Fangs' is a steely-eyed Neubaten pulse tweaked out into a squelchy blast of cheery Aa-styled abandon."   - Christopher Weingarten, Village Voice "Sound of the City" 9/30/10 <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Yvette">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
