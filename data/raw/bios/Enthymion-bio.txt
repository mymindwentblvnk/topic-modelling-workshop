Enthymion was brought to life in early spring of 2006 in Lublin. That was when the original band members i.e. Dlugi (Sannyasin), Omen (ex.Convent) and Kirtabus (ex. Abusiveness) gathered in order to create the infernal material for their debut album. In the meantime Lock (bass) and Gregory (vocals) joined the band.

Within a year 10 original songs were created finally promoted under the general title „The Life of Ligeia”. The album was recorded at the turn of October and November 2008 in Sinquest Studio in Lublin. Soon after that Omen left the group and Gregory took his place as a second guitar player. At present the band is still looking for a label to release „The Life of Ligeia” and working on the second album.

In the meantime some concerts were given in Chelm, Warsaw as well as some local cities.

As for the music it is a mix of the band members' favourite styles. In general it is some kind of metal consisting of fast drums, heavy guitar riffs combined with harmony and some acoustic meloddies. Keyboard parts add some additional dark climate to Enthymion's music.

The lyrics written so far exclusively by Gregory mostly promote the idea of disobedience to any religious doctrines all of which, according to the author, greatly limit one's needs.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Enthymion">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
