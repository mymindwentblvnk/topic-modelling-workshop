Straight Line Stitch is an American metalcore band from Knoxville, Tennessee, formed in 2000. They issued an EP and a demo album before adding female vocalist Alexis Brown from Clarksville to the band in 2003. Brown sang on their self-released 2006 album To Be Godlike and then on an EP entitled The Word Made Flesh for which they filmed a video for the single "Remission". The video's director, Dale Resteghini, owned the production company Raging Nation Films; in 2007 he formed a subsidiary label of Koch Records called Raging Nation Records, and Straight Line Stitch became the label's first signing. Their first nationally distributed album, When Skies Wash Ashore, appeared on the imprint in 2008, with another album, The Fight of Our Lives, arriving in 2011. The Fight of Our Lives reached No. 5 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart and No. 34 on the Top Independent Albums chart. On July 26, 2014, during The Dog Days Of Summer Tour, Straight Line Stitch released their self-titled EP while announcing they are still working on a full-length album. In 2016 bassist Jason White and Alexis Brown had a baby. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Straight+Line+Stitch">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
