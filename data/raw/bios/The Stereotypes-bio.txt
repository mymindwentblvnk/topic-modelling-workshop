San Diego's The Stereotypes, formed in 2001 by John Finkbiner(vocals) and Mike Kamoo(guitar), have a classic sound that mines late-60's jangly psych-pop, indie-garage-rock, and 80's alternative with a post-punk D.I.Y. aesthetic. The band, which also includes Dante Conti(guitar), Tim Hines(bass), Steve Blake(keyboards) and Charlie Mcree(drums), released it's first EP(1-red) to much critical acclaim. The Stereotypes, with their infectious guitar pop melodies, soon found themselves opening shows for the legendary Buzzcocks, Spoon, Supergrass, among others. Although favorably compared to bands such as Wilco, Tom Petty, The Church, The Velvet Underground and The Strokes, the band remains completely fresh and original. The Stereotypes second release(2-brown) ended up on John D. Luerssen's Billboard/ Rolling Stone Top 10 2004: "Garage-punk fireworks and Aussie-like Rickenbacker pop collide with exhilarating results." The Stereotypes will release their fourth album(4-green) in the spring of 2007. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Stereotypes">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
