Somewhere in November of 2007,two guy’s thought it would be a good idea to start a band.Those two guy’s were Thomas and Martin. A few weeks later they asked David and Ramon And that’s how the Ass Goblins were made. After a few months Thomas asked if they would play on a night for his (former) school, and so they all agreed for it. Most of their songs that they played there had a beer,porn,pizza and a goblins theme. And it turned out to be quite a succes. A few months later Stef joined in to be the second guitarist. But after a small gig of they decided that they didn’t connect on a musical level so they let him go. After that had happened Jeroen came into the picture, and when they told him they had to play on Zebra Festival ( Gemert,Holland ) , he was quite nervous about it. But he performed just as the others expected of him. So he could stay in the band. Somewhere around the period of August and November of 2008 they all thought they could actually use a bassist in the band and so Rik came to play his bass in the band. In January of 2009, the band recorded their first demo, titled “From Deep We Come”. The music has a mix of death metal,black metal,folk metal,funk,bubling,techno and even some more styles. The band contains the six members that are the Ass Goblins.
