BORN & RAISED IN N.Y.C I STARTED OUT BACK IN THE DAY @ THE AGE OF 14 WHEN I WAS INTO GRAFF & MUSIC, SOMEHOW THE MUSIC JUST DREW ME IN!...WITH BROTHERS & SISTERS WHO WERE INVOLVED WITH THE MUSIC & MODELING INDUSTRY,( THAT'S WHEN I MET LEFTY LEE) I DID WHAT WAS NATURAL...STARTED SPINNING! WHILE HANGING OUT IN U.S.A. ROLLER RINK I MET THE HOUSE D.J. ~ DJ.BABY J ~WHO INSPIRED ME MORE ON THE 1'S & 2'S . THROWING PRIVATE PARTIES ALL OVER THE 5 BOROUGHS, I ESCALATED TO THE NEXT LEVEL TO PLAY IN CLUBS, BARS, & LOUNGES. MASTERING MY BLENDING & REMIXING, I'M ALWAYS ASKED "HOW DO YOU DO IT?" IT'S JUST IN MY SOUL. I DIDN'T STOP THERE...IN THE LATE 80's(W/ DJ EASE-MAY HE REST IN PEACE- ALONG SIDE DJ HOE) ~THEN CAME ABOUT ULTIMATE SOUND MUSIC PRODUCTIONS!PARTNERING UP W/NEXT DIMENSION & J-KHAN, WE TOOK IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL. WITH THE AMBITION TO BE KNOWN ALL OVER, IT DROVE ME TO BECOME A MUSIC PRODUCER & I STILL CONTINUES TO DO SO. WITH ALL THAT TALENT,DJ MAZE IS STILL HUMBLE & LOVING TO HIS PEERS! MY FAMOUS QUOTE THAT INSPIRES ME TO CONTINUE MY SUCCESS ..." I DO IT FOR THE LOVE OF MUSIC! THANKS TO LEFTY LEE, CISCO KID & BABY J WHO SHOWED ME THE ROPES...THE REST IS HISTORY! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/DJ+MAZE">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
