Inspired by heavy-metal artists overseas, MULTIPLE PERSONALITY DISORDER formed in early 2005 developing their signature metal-hardcore sound into a powerful five piece force thatâ€™s taking southeast Asia by storm.

Hailing from Jakarta, Raya Indonesia, MPD concentrates a more mature musical expression, developing lyrical themes that express the social and emotional elements reflective of world society. With a metal genre that pulls influence from groups in and beyond their homeland, the group blends several elements into one, resulting in something altogether different from previous concepts.

MULTIPLE PERSONALITY DISORDER has self-produced several songs since inception, releasing their finalized EP (Kami Tak Peduli, Kalian Tak Mengerti) in February 2006. With the addition of a new vocalist in 2010, and an expanding global fan-base, MPD is ready to extend beyond borders joining the Itchy Metal roster as the latest international addition.

Members:
Aditia P. Priono- Vox
Dicky Haliansyah- Guitar
Hari A. Ismail- Guitar
Bondan A. Hartanto- Bass
Dimas A. Octavianto- Drums

And in February 2011, they sign in a contract with ITCHY METAL ENTERTAINMENT, a distribution label from Los Angeles, CA.
