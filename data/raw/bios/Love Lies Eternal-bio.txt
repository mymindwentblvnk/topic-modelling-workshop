Inspired by an eccentric form of fantasy/horror fiction, the cinematic soundscapes featured in "Never Ends" are crafted alongside equally melodramatic instrumental embellishments. Like a fitful sleeper, the music drifts restlessly from breath-taking melody to face-melting guitars, a potentially disastrous move, which, given the near-faultless execution of the riffing patterns, works to surprisingly dynamic effect. The celestial symphonies of "Angels of the 7th Dawn" are further enhanced by a stunning array of pulsing industrial beats and heavy riffs, which collectively serve to create a formidable and impenetrable wall of sound. Powerful enough to soar above this multi-layered assault, Nya's voice maintains a rich, bittersweet fluidity, not dissimilar to that of Lacuna Coil siren, Cristina Scabbia. With perfect measures of ambience and howling guitar solos, "Dusk at the Lake" is by far one of the most thrilling and aesthetically pleasing tracks on the album. The atmospheric notes of the piano rise like an all-engulfing mist, whilst the deep, distorted tangle of guitars contribute an appropriately grim sound quality. Despite occasionally veering off course into the realms of haphazard experimentalism, "Never Ends" is, essentially, a powerfully emotive piece. Part dark romance, part flighty escapism, Love Lies Eternal's debut album is both inspired and imaginative in approach.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Love+Lies+Eternal">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
