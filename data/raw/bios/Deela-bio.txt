Ingo Möll is a musician, DJ and producer with a recording studio of his own. Martin Morsch is a percussionist and drummer with a classical education. Together they form Deela, working on their vision of modern club beats.

An effective mix of electronic and sampled elements and live instrumentation makes Deela not only an interesting studio outfit but also an energetic live act - with tones from Funk, Afro, Latin, Jazz, House and many other always contemporary Black Whole Styles.

Deela has been playing live and in the studio in changing formation for a few years now. The core has always been the duo Möll and Morsch as a thumping rhythm cell with a melody. As one of the main acts from the Switchstance Recordings label Deela was responsible for several successful releases in the last years.

The two have also gained some recognition as remixers by now - with works for the likes of Canton from the American label Citrona Recordings or the renowned German act Mo' Horizons from Stereo Deluxe Records.
