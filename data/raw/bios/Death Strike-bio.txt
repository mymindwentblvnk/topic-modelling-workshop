Death Strike were an American death/thrash metal band formed by Paul Speckmann in 1983. The band's "Fuckin' Death" demo from 1985 was heavily influential in the death metal underground. The demo was also released on CD in 1991 with four additional tracks.

The band were disbanded and reformed twice before being put to it's final rest with Speckmann deciding to stick with Master, the band he had formed with Bill Schmidt after they had left War Cry. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Death+Strike">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
