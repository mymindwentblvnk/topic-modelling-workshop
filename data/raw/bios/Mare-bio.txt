There are multiple artists named Mare: 1) A Norwegian black metal band. 2) A Canadian progressive sludge band.

1) Mare is a black metal band from Trondheim, Norway. Its members play in other notable bands of the Norwegian scene such as Kaosritual, Celestial Bloodshed, Grenjar, Black Majesty, among others.
"Those who heard the call of the Nidrosian moon sabbath, come forth and wander deep into these spheres like death, mysteries and darkness... Some call it black metal, some call them Nachtmahrwaltzer, but we call it life. A life that that reaches its worth only when the offerlams blood fills the chalice..."

2) Mare was a progressive sludge band from Oakville/Burlington, Canada, orchestrated primarily by frontman Tyler Semrick-Palmateer, previously on vocal duty for tech-metal outfit The End. In a unique mixture of sludge, doom metal and and other textures that defy immediate genres or categorization, Tyler brings a mix of desperate screams and haunting melodic singing in a style that seems to be a natural evolution from his performance on The End's album Transfer Trachea Reverberations from Point: False Omniscient.
Mare has a 5-song self-titled EP initially released on Translation Loss Records. The band was later signed by Hydra Head, who re-released the EP. A cover of the song Night Goat was also released on a tribute album to The Melvins, compiled by Fractured Transmitter Records.
In February of 2007, Tyler posted an entry on the band's myspace stating that Mare was over due to a lack of motivation to write and record more material for the project. He did, however, indicate that he and Caleb intend to collaborate in the future.
