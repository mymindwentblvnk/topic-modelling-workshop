The Cumshots was a Norwegian hard rock / death'n'roll band founded in Oslo, Norway in 1999 by Ole Petter Andreassen ("El Doom", guitar) and Kristopher Schau ("Max Cargo", vocals). They are associated with the Norwegian label Duplex, which is known for its many humourous rock bands. Schau is also a famous norwegian comedian/tv-personality.

The band's first lineup consisted of the two founders and Christian Svendsen ("Rodriguez Morales/Chris Bartender", drums), Tommy Reitan ("Tommy Dean", bass) and Tommy Hjelm ("Tom Schlong", guitar). The Cumshots soon became known for their liveshows which contained lots of tequila, fighting between the bandmembers, blood and broken bones.

Still, The Cumshots is not a humour band and in 2002 they won an unofficial world championship in rock in Bilbao, Spain.  The championship was only contested by bands who only have released one album. The following year they were nominated to Alarmprisen (Norwegian music awards) and Tommy Hjelm was replaced by Fredrik Gretland ("Fredde Tennessee", guitar). Since then, their music has evolved into more melodic rock/metal. 

The band created big headlines in Norway during the Quart Festival in 2004 when a couple had sex on stage. This resulted in fines and court trials for all band members, in addition to the couple who had sex.
