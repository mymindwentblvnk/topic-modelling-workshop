There are 2 artists that preform under the name Back In Black.

An instrumental black metal band from China

and 

An AC/DC tribute band. Back In Black was formed in late 2001 by former LA bandmates Mike Mroz (Angus) and Darren Caperna (Bon  & Brian). Mike had always recognized the potential of this project due to Darren’s uncanny ability to transcend both the spirit of Bon Scott and Brian Johnson into his voice.  Jay Benzi (drums), and Mike Wagner (guitar) were found via an ad in the Dallas Observer.  Taylor Smith (bass) was added in 2002 due to his incredible musicianship and voice. The band has created an incredible buzz which has placed them as one of the top drawing tribute acts in North America, performing sold out shows from Puerto Rico to Toronto .   They also recently performed to over 36,000 people at the Bone Bash in Ft Worth, and have been recruited by Sony Music, AC/DC’s new record label, to promote catalog sales.  20th Century Fox have chosen Back in Black over all other tribute bands to record AC/DC’s classics “TNT” and “A long way to the top” for two of their movies, Napoleon Dynamite and Garage Days.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Back+In+Black">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
