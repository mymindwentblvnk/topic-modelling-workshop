New England's 3 HEADED MONSTER consists of four former high school buddies who have been playing music for a number of years already with their all-instrumental blend of genres, varying from power and thrash to prog and old-fashioned heavy metal. While conceptually the members of 3 HEADED MONSTER keep their tongues firmly in cheek with monster movie and pro-wrestling themes, they're dead serious about their metal. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/3+Headed+Monster">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
