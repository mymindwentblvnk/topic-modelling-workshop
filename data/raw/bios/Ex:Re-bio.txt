Ex:Re is the solo project of Elena Tonra, lead singer and guitarist of the indie band Daughter. 

Her self-titled debut album was released on Friday, November 30, 2018, shortly following lead single "Romance," released the previous Tuesday.

Speaking about the new record, Elena said: “Although the record is written for someone, a lot of the time it’s about the space without that person in it. In every scenario, there’s either the person in memory or the noticeable absence of that person in the present moment. I suppose it is a break-up record, however I do not talk about the relationship at all, and he hardly features in the scenes. He is only felt as a ghostly presence.” <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ex:Re">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
