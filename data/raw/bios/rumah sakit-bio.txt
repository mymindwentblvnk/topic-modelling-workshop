Hailing from San Francisco, CA (and featuring members of Tarentel and Tsui), Rumah Sakit (pronounced like Room-Uh-Sock-Eeet!) create a head-swirling excercise in progressive rock intuition. A blend of prog, classic jazz, and contemporary pop that floats in and out of everything from 'Bitches Brew'-era Miles Davis to King Crimson. 'Rumah Sakit' translates as 'Sick house' (hospital) in Indonesian Language. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rumah+Sakit">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
