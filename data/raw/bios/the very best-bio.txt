Esau Mwamwaya was born in Mzuzu, Malawi in southeast Africa. He grew up in the capital, Lilongwe, where he played drums in various bands such as Masaka Band. He was a good friend of the legendary Evison Matafale and they played together for several years before Matafale was killed in Malawi police custody in 2003.

In 1999 Esau Mwamwaya moved to London, England has until recently run a second-hand furniture store in Clapton, East London, UK.

Esau's shop was on the same street as Radioclit's old studio, and after the Radioclit boys bought a bike from Esau they invited him to one of their house warming parties. They made friends and started working on music together. Two years later and the project has gotten its name: The Very Best.
