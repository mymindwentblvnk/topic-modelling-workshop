Desaparecidos is an American punk rock band from Omaha, Nebraska. It is headed by singer/guitarist Conor Oberst, the frontman of Bright Eyes. "Desaparecidos" means "disappeared ones" in Spanish and is a reference to the left-wing activists arrested by South American military dictatorships who vanished without a trace.

Desaparecidos initially broke up in 2002 after releasing their first album, Read Music/Speak Spanish, as well as touring with Jimmy Eat World and The Promise Ring. Members went on to form other projects. The band reunited in 2010 to play the Concert for Equality in Omaha. The band released two new tracks, "MariKKKopa" in 2012, written about Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Arizona and civil rights abuses committed against undocumented immigrants. 

In 2015, the band signed to Epitaph Records and released their second album, Payola, featuring appearances by Laura Jane Grace of Against Me! and Tim Kasher of Cursive.
