Band was founded in January 2003 by Miha Kadis and Primoz Mori. In March David Piko - PIKI has joined on the bass guitar but soon, he changed it for regular guitar. On the bass guitar they engaged Ziga Grubelnik - ZGANC and for vocals Gregor Vrtic. In June 2003 they started to practice but soon changes were made in the vocal section. Vrtic has been replaced with Tomaz Hostinger - HOSTA. Their first gig was METALIZACIJA X in Kompleks along with Sarcasm, Vargsriket, Soon after, they played on ROCK'n'ROLL festival of Koroska. They were third. After that they had been touring acros Slovenija, from Kranj to Ljubljana, Koper, Brezice, Selnica, Celje, Maribor, around 16 gigs. At this time they started to think about a demo CD. Soon it was recorded in their own production. The goal was to show the music to wider public. After they've stoped touring, they started to work on a new material which of course had to be recorded. By the time second demo had been finished, the band split up with ZGANC. New bass player became Tilen Hudrap TILC (ex Ferrum Noricum). Now the band is playing and writting new material. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wartune">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
