Herodias is a doom metal band from New York, USA founded
by Kristina and Michael Rocco in 2012. Stylistically, the music
encompasses a range of contemporary funeral doom with
classical vocals.

      In literature, Herodias was commonly known as the wife
of Herod Antipas. Their marriage was censured by John the
Baptist as a transgression of Mosaic Law. Salome (Herodiasâ€™
daughter) performed a dance that so pleased Herod that he
offered to grant any wish she expressed. Prompted by her
mother, Salome asked for John the Baptist's head on a
platter, a wish the reluctant Herod was bound to fulfill. As
punishment, Herod was exiled to a deserted island and
Herodias chose to go with him.

      In medieval Europe, a widespread belief held Herodias to
be the supernatural leader of a cult of witches. She rose from
the dead, taking shape as a new goddess in the Pagan
pantheon.
