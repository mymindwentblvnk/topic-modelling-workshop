In 2004 the first idea for a band which later would be called Asmodi was born. One day Bilwis, Daevas and Volac met and decided to make musik together. With Volac on the drums, Daevas on the guitar and Bilwis doing the vocals they started first musical skirmishes. The basis to the band Asmodi was created. Soon Nikolai joined the band, however, left it fast again as it was simply not his music genre. From now on Malphas played the leadguitar and so far only a bass player was still missing. He was found in the narrow circle of friends and from now on Morvan played the bass guitar. Finally, own songs were written and they committed themselves to Black Metal with Pagan/Viking influences. In the end of 2005 Malphas left the band for personal reasons. Morvan took his place and played in guitar and bass on the debut album "Schattenwald". After a long search they decided to take Joetun as their new bass player. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Asmodi">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
