✞"Dark Portrait" were formed in October of 2010. After a couple of changes, the line-up was completed in April 2011 with:
+Antonis Economidis (vocals)
+Alex Pafilis (keyboards)
+Tasos Metzaliras (lead guitar)
+Simos Panagiotoglou (rythm guitar)
+Aggelos Mastorakos (bass)
+Achilles Kamzolas (drums)

✞In May of 2012, for personal reasons, Simos left the band, leaving his place empty.. After a few months, from some really "haphazard" cicrumstances, his place was filled by a man with strong underpinnings in the Greek Underground Metal scene.
✞Filled with appetite for work and puzzled for this new member who came along with new ideas and energy, they start again from the very point they stopped!

✞Their music is Majestc Black Metal with Gothic elements.

✞Their first work in an EP form is coming soon, entitled "Fiend Incarnate".

✞ In the Greek scene, even in the Underground sector, there are one too few bands of this genre and ideology.
✞Dark Portrait are trying to remind the people that melody and magic can grant you a journey... <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dark+Portrait">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
