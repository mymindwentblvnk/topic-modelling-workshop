Azhirock is a Progressive Death Metal band from Tehran, Iran. It was formed by Babak Farrokhi, Soheil Olfat and Ali Z (Bass player) in 2006. 

After they finished recording their Demo album "Sacred Inferno", Ali Z left the band. That was the time they were thinking and dreaming about their first video for the song "That Someone Is Me". Bahman Tirgan filmed and directed that. 

After several months (Spring 2009) Soheil and Babak started making their debut album. Also they made their second video: "Annihilated Lucifer "; a prototype of Iranian Nu/Progressive Death Metal song. 

Due to signing up in Festivals and willing to hold live concerts, Soheil and Babak decided to form the band by adding new members. 

August 2009, Kasra Momeni joined the band as Lead guitar player and played solo parts in songs "Unnecessarily Alive","Parade Of Animality" and "Shadow Of Faith".  The month after Hossein Salehi came as bass guitar player and Shahin Jebelli as drummer. they are playing together in order to keep themselves ready for live concerts.
