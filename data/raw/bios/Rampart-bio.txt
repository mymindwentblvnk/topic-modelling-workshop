Rampart was founded around 2006. The young band went through lots of changes in the line up but it did not change its face and its voice Maria D.S.

On the 08.08.2008 Rampart released their debut single: “Warriors". It got some highly encouraging feedback from the metal press in Bulgaria, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Norway, Denmark and UK. Sure enough, French record label Inferno Records signed the band and released Rampart’s debut album "Voice of the Wilderness" in 2010. The album is full of catchy melodies, pounding rhythms, twin guitar solos and even orchestrations. 

Rampart will also appear on the tribute album to Helloween and Gamma Ray - "Helloray - A Tribute To Helloween & Gamma Ray". This tribute album also features Norway's Gaia Epicus, Germany's Kickhunter (featuring Helloween bassist Markus Großkopf), Slovakia's Signum Regis (featuring former Yngwie Malmsteen/Glory singer Göran Edman) and others. "Helloray" will be released in the fall of 2011 via Epicus Records.

The band is about to release a concert album “Live in London” in November 2011 and second full-length album “Stormforce” in early 2012. Rampart is heavily inspired by old-school heavy metal bands but their music has recently been taking a more Progressive slant. The band’s mission is to be the banner of the Heavy Metal for Bulgaria.




Rampart is also a heavy metal band hailing from the city of Vaasa (Finland). Their influences include: Judas Priest, Accept, Megadeth, Ozzy Osbourne, Iron Maiden, Dio, AC/DC and Black Sabbath.
