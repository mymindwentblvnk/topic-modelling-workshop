1) Side project of Buka and Level of Argyle Park.

2) It's hard these days to come across an original concept in music. Today's scene is jam packed with overproduced, streamlined product placements, spoon fed to the masses through every nook and cranny made available by the mega corporations. On the other hand you've always got your run of the mill rebels refusing to release anything that's even been tuned properly. True blue anti-anything "musicians", happy to never make a buck as long as their bird is constantly flipped at the establishment. Music has fallen on hard times, super exposed hard times. What makes anything interesting anymore? I'll tell you what. Emotion, sincerity and music for the sake of music, not poisoned by greed or social convictions. A group of people creating music, together. Preforming, recording and designing what their hearts desire. True blue musicians playing true blue music out of sheer love for the hell of it. They are called Backwoods. Want to have a listen?
