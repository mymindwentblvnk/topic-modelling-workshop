Teratogenesis is Mankind, born defective, unwilling to die. Non genre-bound metal with roots in black and death. Lyrically Teratogenesis revolves around this apocalyptic world and its decline evident in violence, corruption, cowardice, dishonour, the fall of cultures, the degeneration of man, the absence of God.
Teratogenesis is a symptom of the Kali Yuga. 

Svarthjelm (aka JRole, Eikonos, Johnny Hell) from the duo has several other ongoing projects, Eikonos - a solo IDM/experimental project that flirts heavily with the 8bit-scene. Catonium - neoclassical and dark ambient to more industrial tones, with some darkwave planted in the middle. Machine music in its most experimental form.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Teratogenesis">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
