Morhana is a folk metal band which joins heavy and melodic sounds, achieving balance between folk music and rough, but not banal metal. Morhana draws inspirations from different parts of the world - they courageously take fast and lively tunes from Brittany, but also refer to sounds which are pure slavonic. The presence of classical instruments gives the songs a feeling of lightness, which in mix with heavy and powerful guitar backline gives thundering effect. The vocals - strong, menly form one side - and high and clean female voice fromt the other joined with music create unique character of the band.
