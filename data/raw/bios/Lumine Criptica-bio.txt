After a year of preparation, in which no detail was left to chance, Lumine Criptica released its first album “Fading Into Darkness.” 

In this debut, the band shows the wide range in which it can move, feeling comfortable both in brutal riffs full of blast beats, and acoustic sections where the female voice voice stands out above the rest of the instruments. And it is these contrasts that 
make listening to “Fading Into Darkness” an experience from which all can be expected. 

During 2011 the band filmed his first DVD at the Roxy Live! in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

Currently the band is in the writing process of it's new album that will be release in 2012.
