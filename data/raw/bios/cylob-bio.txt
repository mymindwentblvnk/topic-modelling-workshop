Another product of Richard "Aphex Twin" James' Rephlex stable, Chris Jeffs' releases as Cylob and Kinesthesia have numbered among the Cornwall-based imprint's most celebrated recent releases. He has declared that "anyone who applies the term IDM to my music deserves to be shot".  Not nearly as prolific as his friends and sometime-labelmates James and Mike Paradinas (Âµ-Ziq), Jeffs has nonetheless amassed an impressive catalog of releases in a relatively short period of time. Although he only began experimenting with electronics in 1991, within five years Jeffs released three EPs and three full-lengths -- including the cheeky DJ double-pack Loops and Breaks (as Cylob) and the sparse ambient of Empathy Box (as Kinesthesia) -- in addition to remixes for Aphex Twin, Bochum Welt, and Immersion. Although focusing more recently on a refined brand of ambient breakbeat and techno, Jeffs' stylistic palette includes crunchy, industrial-leaning techno, beatless ambient, and new-school electro-funk.

2007 saw a burst of new activity from Cylob, including both new and archive material released on Jeffs' own Cylob Industries label. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cylob">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
