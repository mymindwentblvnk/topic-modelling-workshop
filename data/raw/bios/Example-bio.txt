2. Example consists of rapper: Kay and producer Cipher. They are signed to Beat Farm, where they released the Impulse EP back in 1997. They also released two singles on Vinyl in 2000 titled 'We Write The Songs / That Is...' & 'The Price You Gotta' Pay... (Pt. 2) / Them From "Id Est"'. Unfortunately no debut album came out of the duo.

"Ok, here's the short version. Kay & I became roommates March 1996 & started a group called Example (I.E.). That summer, Example & the K-Otix had a meeting about putting our music out independently. The plan was to put out a double-sided EP, one side Example & the other K-Otix. Well, things didn't go as planned, so both groups decided to do 2 seperate EPs & release them around the same time. Done deal. Kay became writing the very first song on July 26, 1996. We both produced 3 songs each on the EP. January 1997, we released our 6 song EP titled, "Impulses". We only pressed 500 copies." - Cipher <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Example">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
