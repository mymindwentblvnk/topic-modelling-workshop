It was the year of 2007 when somewhere deep in the woods, from under the strong roots of mighty oaks and beeches in the dead of the cold winter night, the tranquillity was disturbed by an unusual happening. Something awoke…
The hidden became visible. What many had forgotten emerged. At first dull and indistinct, it came to be increasingly magnificent and impressive.
From the dark depths of the forest the lost song rose once more; Brezno (The Abyss) was born.

The beginning of the group foretold a period which connected the members of the band under the same ideology and offered them unforgettable moments of making music that harks back to their roots, music which flows through their veins - folk metal.

Current line-up:
Sara Jeremič - vocals
Eva Zupan - flutes, whistles
Katarina Snoj - keyboards, vocals
Max Petač - guitars
Mitja Usenik - bass guitar, vocals
Luka 'Lux' Žnideršič - guitar, vocals
Matej Hrustek - drums

In the past year the band has gained a growing fan base by playing concerts throughout Slovenia and nearby countries. They have also recorded several songs which can be found on their introductory CD “Viharnik”.

The members of the band search for inspiration in the traditions of their ancestors and through the narratives of old cultures. Through the lyrics they try to convey their values, beliefs and perspectives of a person and his/hers connection to nature.
