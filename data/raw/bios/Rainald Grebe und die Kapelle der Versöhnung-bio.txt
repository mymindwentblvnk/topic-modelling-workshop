Die 'Kapelle der Vers√∂hnung' (German for 'The Ensemble of Conciliation') is a cabaret band founded by Rainald Grebe; their music, among other styles, contains folk and rock elements. As Grebe is the writer for all of the Kapelle's lyrics, their songs are very similar to his solo works; however, the songs feature a more diverse variety of musical styles, not least because at least three different instruments are used. Also some instrumental versions of already well-known Grebe songs have been created, i.e. 'Brandenburg'. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Rainald+Grebe+und+die+Kapelle+der+Vers%C3%B6hnung">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
