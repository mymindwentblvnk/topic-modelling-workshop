Founded in 2015 in Angarsk, Irkutsk region. At the beginning of its creative path Ensslin was an instrumental band. It should be noted that the two members have previously played in the band Buran (emo violence), in Ensslin they radically changed to the sound similar to the midwest. The first show was in the spring on March 7, 2015. The audience met them with warmth. Later, long searches of the vocalist began. In the end they found Christina, whose voice, brought the lyrics into the music, and the sound became even more melodic ..
In the summer of the same year, the band released the debut EP Ensslin - Self-Titled / Dali, then had several local concerts and then went on a tour of Siberian cities. After some time Ensslin became known not only in Russia, but also abroad. In 2016, the drummer left the band. No one was found as a replacement and the collective took an indefinite leave. In the spring of 2017, the drummer returned to the group and a decision is made to go on tour across Russia right before the release of the full-length album.
Christina (vocals), Sasha (guitar), Nikita (bass), Vova (drums)
