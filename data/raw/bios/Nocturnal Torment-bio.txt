Nocturnal Torment was originally formed in 1988 with band members Mark Schultz (guitar) and David Ross (drums) from Chesterton, Indiana. In 1989 Nocturnal Torment became Thanatopsis with the inclusion of guitarist Tom Stathis & proceeded to record their debut demo "A View of Death" (currently being pressed by the Cursed Productions label.) Roughly 6 months after the recording the band split up over musical differences. Since that time the different members found themselves in various bands including Ripping Headaches, Termination, Naked Headbone, Invasion, Martyrdome, Morgue, Afterlife & Impending Doom. Beginning in 2008 Mark Schultz & Dave Ross joined forces with original Thanatopsis/Termination guitarist Tom Stathis to rewrite & recreate the music that influenced them from the mid/late 80’s & early 1990’s. Along with former Shades of Grey/Sea of Tranquillity bassist Peter Clemens the band hopes to spread their infected music to the underground loyalists.
