Domination Black is a six-piece heavy "horror" metal band from Karhula, Finland. The group's line-up since forming in 2003 has consisted of vocalist Kari A. Kilgast (a.k.a. The Sentinel), guitarists Teppo "Absinth" Heiskanen and Ville Wiren, bassist Sir Eerola, keyboardist Juuso Welder and drummer Juha Beck.

The group released a few "tongue-in cheek" demos and one real demo between 2003 and 2005, which demonstrated the group's heavy influence from 1980s heavy metal. The group signed to Poison Arrow Records, releasing their debut, Fearbringer, in 2005, which drew comparisons to early Metallica and early Judas Priest, They have since recorded one more album for Poison Arrow Records called Dark Legacy. Their latest effort is an EP called Haunting, released via Violent Journey Recordson on February 20th, 2008.
