There are 2 artists who go by the name Encompass.

1. Encompass was formed in Alexandria, Virginia by four musicians of diverse musical and cultural backgrounds, coming together in March 2001. Despite several successful concerts and the gathering of a loyal following, the group disbanded later that year for what could euphemistically be termed "musical differences". In April of 2004, the band decided to reunite and use those musical differences synergistically to produce music that can best be described as “alternative prog rock.” 

Encompass fuses many progressive elements in their hard rock sound with powerful melodies that captivates the listener. The sound of Encompass would be best described as if they were originally born in the early progressive rock era with Rush and Genesis as their respective guardians. Somewhere along the way they rebelled and strayed toward catchier melodies and a heavier sound which opened a new door to an audience that would never think of listening to anything “progressive.” Combining technical proficiency with sonically charged dynamics and catchy melodies, Encompass can make 10 minute epics sound as if they are only 5, leaving the audience always yearning for more. Their unique sound has allowed them to share the stage with several metal bands such as Sonata Arctica, and Seven Witches, to the progressive rock giants Spock’s Beard, Symphony X, and Zero Hour. The lead guitar work of guitar/vocalist Farhad Hossain has also allowed the band to share the stage with guitar shred wizard Joe Stump.
