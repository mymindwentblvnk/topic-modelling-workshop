Forgotten Garden are an Indie Rock band (duo+guests) with gothic post-punk tendencies. They also undertake occasional forays into more acoustic territory. 

The haunting vocals are provided by Inês whilst Danny plays most of the instruments. Both live in the north of Scotland although Inês comes from Portugal. They started working together in 2019.

The Broken Pieces EP that dropped in September 2020 is Forgotten Garden's first release. It contains four tracks based around the theme of a relationship breakdown. 

Jane  Ireland of Angry Baby described Broken Pieces thus:

 "The band’s first release sounds anything but; the four tracks zing with gorgeous pop lines accompanied by folk, rock and dream pop tones, whilst Ines’ vocals turn chameleon like from ethereal to earthy in a heartbeat"

The music of Forgotten Garden is mostly inspired by post-punk bands such as The Cure, Joy Division, The Smiths and their predecessors The Doors but also contains a wide plethora of other influences. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Forgotten+Garden">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
