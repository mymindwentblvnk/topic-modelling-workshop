BLACK PYRAMID play doom with the rumbling down-tuned tones of stoner metal gods like Sleep, Electric Wizard, and High On Fire, but with the epic arrangements of old school metal and doom acts such as Black Sabbath, Pentagram, and The Obsessed. Add to the sonic brew perfectly executed forays into vintage psych and progressive rock, along with the apocalyptic lyrical ravings about war, the occult, and general alienation, and you've got an accurate picture of what the band is all about.

Formed in 2007, the American trio composed at that time of Andy Beresky (guitar/vocals), Eric Beaudry (bass) and Clay Neely (drums), immediately caught the attention of the Stoner/Doom scene with their Demo (2007) and first EP (2008). After the departure of Eric Beaudry and the addition of Gein, they confirmed their status with their following full-length album “Black Pyramid”, released in 2009 on Electric Earth / MeteorCity Record. After this release BLACK PYRAMID proceeded to hit the road on several tours and unleashed a tide of singles and splits.

In late 2011, MeteorCity released their second full-length album, “II”. But right after the release of their latter LP, Andy Beresky left the band, and after some soul-searching, Neely and Gein decided to continue BLACK PYRAMID, bringing on board guitarist/vocalist Darryl Shepard and setting almost immediately about writing new material which would culminate in the 2013 release of "Adversarial" on Hydro-Phonic Records. 

After a successful 2013 tour across Europe, the band went on brief hiatus, emerging in late 2015 with the re-formed original lineup of Beresky, Beaudry, and Neely. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Black+Pyramid">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
