Emerging from the year 2011, melodic black metal band, Exile The Traitor was born. Growing from a passion towards the extreme and the technical, with a desire to destroy and conquer every stage they have the pleasure of stepping foot on. 

Heavily influenced by the likes of Black Dahlia Murder and At The Gates, Exile The Traitor are looking to take this genre to a whole new level. Their hard work and determination got them noticed after being together for just a few months; as they were crowned 2012 winners of Bloodstock Open Air’s Metal to the Masses (unsigned) competition in Glasgow.

Since this landslide win, Exile The Traitor have satisfied their hunger of attacking stages with the ferocity at which they write. Boasting a three-track EP, Necrology, which propelled them further into the scene and are now taking their sound out of Glasgow and are ready to descend on your city. Prepare to get your teeth kicked in!

New music and shows coming soon.

“if you want some heavy, no bullshit, bottle over yer head metal that doesn't take itself too seriously, then take in an Exile The Traitor gig soon!” HellFire Glasgow Club

“What Exile the Traitor has in their favor is some serious chops. The vocals are a potent low rumble and the guitars are technical and precise.” The Metal Crypt
