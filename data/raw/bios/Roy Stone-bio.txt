    Getting out there gigging is what its all about, the life blood of  Rock!!

Up to an hour & a half of live material, ROY STONE is Lead Vocals & Lead Guitar live, advertised as “Probably The Fastest Lead Guitar In The World” which is for contention, strong melodic Rock & crunching Metal Tracks, normaly a guitar solo section is amongst the songs too…. 

Lead Guitar Solo spots, wild lead guitar at colossal speed to open a show or between Bands.   

As VOCALIST & Lead guitarist, ROY STONE sings a powerfull Rock vocal style whilst playing Rythm Guitar that is sometimes 16 time's the beat of the music, punctuated with lead guitar runs that descend into musical changes & lead guitar breaks with howling long notes & runs so fast you'l miss it if your not concentrating!
