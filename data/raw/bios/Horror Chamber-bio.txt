Horror Chamber began on Canoas/RS, in 2004 searching its own kind of Death Metal.
In the beginning of 2005, Horror Chamber decides to select some pre recorded material and released, in 2006, the Demo “The Horror Chamber” to distribute amongst the scene. That way happened the first gigs outside Rio Grande do Sul State.
After some line up changes and a period searching new members, Horror Chamber stablished in four members and, in 2008, began the recordings of “The Devil Has No Face” EP.
The material was released in September 2009, divulging the maturity acquired in years on the road and the professional work of the well-known Hurricane Studio ro reach higher grounds, like the release of the next work.
