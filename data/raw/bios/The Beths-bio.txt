The Beths are a New Zealand indie rock/pop band, originally from Auckland, New Zealand that combines energized guitar riffs, melodic hooks, and harmonized backing vocals in their impulsive indie rock. Lead vocalist and guitarist Elizabeth Stokes met guitarist Jonathan Pearce and bassist Benjamin Sinclair while they were all in bands in high school. While playing underground gigs around Auckland, they befriended drummer Tristan Deck, who joined the group in 2019. Their blend of propulsive, sing-along choruses, four-part vocal arrangements, and wry, introspective lyrics has earned them fans around the world, as well as opening slots for indie rock titans like The Breeders, Pixies, Weezer, and Death Cab for Cutie.   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Beths">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
