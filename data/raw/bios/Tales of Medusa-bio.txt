Tales of Medusa is a Heavy Metal band from Canada.

Not much is known about this band and nothing is really that clear. This ranges from where they were formed to who actually plays in the band. But what is known, is the fact that they've been very strict with the releasing of their albums and that they self-produce everything. As a result of this, the pressing of their material is very limited and it should also be noted that everything they produce is sent out for free.
