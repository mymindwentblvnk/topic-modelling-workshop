3) Dreams was one of the original prominent jazz-rock bands recording for Columbia Records in the period of the late 1960's and early 1970's which included Chicago, Blood, Sweat & Tears, Chase, Flock, and Soft Machine. While Dreams did not achieve the commercial success of either Chicago or Blood Sweat & Tears, they did serve as a launchpad for eventually prominent jazz fusion artists Billy Cobham, Don Grolnick, and Randy & Michael Brecker (Later known as the Brecker Brothers). Other prominent band members included guitarist John Abercrombie, trombonist Barry Rogers, and bassist Will Lee.

The principal difference between Dreams and most of their fellow brass-led bands was, according to their album sleevenotes, that they didn't work from written arrangements, but rather worked them out 'Trad' or 'New Orleans style', playing whatever came into their heads and waiting for something to gel. After the demise of Dreams, Grolnick, Lee, and the brothers formed The Brecker Brothers Band, but this time they did work from very tightly controlled arrangements.

4) Dreams are a pop/psychedelic band from Porto, Portugal.
