The Fu-Schnickens were a hip-hop trio in the early 1990s. Similar to Das EFX for their cartoonish lyrics and near-constant allusions to pop culture staples, the Fu-Schnickens' popularity was brief but significant in hip hop history. Their best known track is 1993's "What's Up Doc? (Can We Rock)," which featured basketball star Shaquille O'Neal (Shaq Fu), which was a Top 40 hit.

The Fu-Schnickens comprised Chip Fu (Roderick Roachford), Moc Fu (J. Jones), and Poc Fu (Lennox Maturine). The three friends from East Flatbush (a neighborhood in the Brooklyn borough of New York City) first gained attention after performing at a rap event at Howard University, after which they were signed by Jive Records.
