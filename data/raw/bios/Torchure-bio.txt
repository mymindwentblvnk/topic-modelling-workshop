The German death metal band Torchure formed in 1985. After several demo tapes they released two albums through the small label 1MF (1 More Flop Records). After the release of their debut album in 1992 they toured throughout Europe in support of Sepultura and Pestilence. However, two members of the band were killed in a car accident. For the second album twin guitarists Mario and Malte Staller were added. The album was produced by S.L. Coe of Scanner. To promote the album Torchure did a 40 date European tour together with Disharmonic Orchestra. They probably broke up soon after that.
