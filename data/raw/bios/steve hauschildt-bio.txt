Steve Hauschildt is a recording artist based in Chicago, Illinois, United States.

He is perhaps best known as a synthesist and keyboard player in the band Emeralds. Hauschildt also runs the label Gneiss Things, which has released limited edition runs of Emeralds-related ephemera as well as works by similar artists.

Hauschildt has always considered himself more of an artist than a musician, and sees his work both in group and solo settings as much a visual experience as it is an aural one. As a teen, he bypassed the typical young music fan obsessions over punk and hardcore musics, drawn instead towards mid-late 90s techno/electro-revivalism and finding himself alone in an electronic universe of his own choosing.

In 2011 his debut solo album Tragedy & Geometry was released via Kranky Records.
