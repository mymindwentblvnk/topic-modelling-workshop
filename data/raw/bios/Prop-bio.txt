Prop from Sydney released one of the most acclaimed and groundbreaking albums of 2001, “Small Craft Rough Sea”. This album was one of the hit pics for media across Australia and earned the group support slots with groups such as Stereolab, Tortoise and featured spots at festivals and even The Sydney Opera House. They had a 7” released in Japan, and various tracks licensed for compilations for Australia and worldwide.  They were the only Australian act requested to perform at The Enchanted Garden in the UK, one of the worlds most acclaimed multi-media arts festivals.

The group ended up dissolving as members got involved in other projects. Some individual members: toured the world with silverchair and Jackie Orszaczky, recorded and toured with Paul Mac & Pnau, toured Asia with a symphony orchestra, performed and toured with Jenny Morris and Brooke McClyrmont and released side project and solo albums.

Julian Hamilton and Kim Moyes from the band went on to form electronic duo The Presets. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Prop">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
