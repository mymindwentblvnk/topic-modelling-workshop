Autogen is an experimental solo industrial and power electronics project from Rīga, Latvia founded in 2008 by frontman Kaspars Kalnins, otherwise known as Kaps. 
Since 2008 project has been active in live stage performance and has played at numerous industrial and fetish clubs in Latvia, Finland, Belarus, Hungary, Denmark, Lithuania, Estonia, Malaysia, Singapore, Peru, Argentina, Japan and Thailand. Autogen’s shows often display gruesome theatrics of blood, gore and fetishism accompanied by their signature trance-inducing electronic soundscape compositions that exude an enthralling ritualistic atmosphere juxtaposing invocative sight and sound.
