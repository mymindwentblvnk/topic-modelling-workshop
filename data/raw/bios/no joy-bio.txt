The doomy shoegaze band No Joy began in November 2009, when guitarist/vocalist Jasamine White-Gluz was living in Los Angeles and guitarist/vocalist Laura Lloyd was living in Montreal. The pair wrote songs as long-distance collaborators until White-Gluz moved to Montreal and they could play shows together. 

The bandâ€™s moody, interlocking guitars and ethereal vocals allowed them to fit on bills with bands as diverse as Wavves, Harvey Milk, and Besnard Lakes. Meanwhile, Mexican Summer signed No Joy and issued their self-titled 7", which was produced by Miracle Fortress' Graham Van Pelt in 2010. The band expanded to a four-piece and enlisted the Raveonettes' Sune Rose-Wagner to mix their full-length album, Ghost Blonde, which was released in November 2010.

Their second album Wait To Pleasure was released in April 2013 to critical acclaim. 

No Joy followed up Wait To Pleasure with an EP released November 5 2013 entitled "Pastel and Pass Out"
