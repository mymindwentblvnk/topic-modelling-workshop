Ablach formed in Aberdeen Scotland, Summer 2007 and features ex-members of crustcore outfit Filthpact and current members of death metallers Bonesaw, two bands which have played prominent roles on both the underground punk and metal scenes across the UK and Europe. 

Ablach played their first gig on Dec 30th 2007, recording their demo shortly afterwards and have since shared stages with some of the best hardcore, grindcore, metal and punk bands around including: Achren, A Den Of Robbers, Afgrund, Atomgevitter, Black Sister, Cancer Bats, Captain Cleanoff, Co-Exist, Discharge, Diskelma, Drive By Audio, Ehnahre, Joe Pesci, Flatlands, F.U.B.A.R, Ghoul Patrol, Gruesome Stuff Relish, Reth, Rising Terror, Sic, Step On It, $ylvester $taline, Unspoken and Wojczech. A full UK tour, with Afgrund from Sweden was completed in September 2008 and the demo was also repressed as a 7" by Problem Records (UK) for the tour. 

2009 has so far seen the band play various shows around Scotland and their debut album 'Aon (One)' (Containing artwork by Stiv – Visions of War and mixed and mastered by Brian 'Bri Doom' Talbot – Doom, Lazarus Blackstar, Sore Throat and The Devils) released globally on CD by Blastwork Records (Malaysia – Birdflesh, Iron Lung, Phobia, Regurgitate, Splitter and Suppository). Musically the album has been described as sounding along the lines of Brutal Truth, Carcass and Napalm Death and lyrically it deals with topics relating to Scottish culture, history and society.
