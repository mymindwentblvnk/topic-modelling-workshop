Sunny & the Sunglows (later known as Sunny & the Sunliners) were an American musical group formed in 1959 in San Antonio, Texas.

The group's members were all chicanos, and their style was a blend of rhythm and blues, tejano, blues, and mariachi.[1] They first recorded in 1962 for their own label, Sunglow. Okeh Records picked up their single "Golly Gee" for national distribution that year, and in 1963, Huey Meaux, a producer from Louisiana and owner of Tear Drop Records, had them record a cover version of Little Willie John's 1958 hit, "Talk to Me". The single (b/w "Every Week, Every Month, Every Year"), released on Tear Drop Records (#3014), went to #4 on the Adult Contemporary chart, #12 on the US Black Singles chart and #11 on the Billboard Hot 100 in late 1963.[2] The group followed this release with several further covers - "Rags to Riches" (Tony Bennett) b/w "Not Even Judgment Day", "Out of Sight-Out of Mind" (The Five Keys) b/w "No One Else Will Do", and "La Cacahuata" (The Peanuts) b/w "Happy Hippo". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sunny+&+The+Sunglows">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
