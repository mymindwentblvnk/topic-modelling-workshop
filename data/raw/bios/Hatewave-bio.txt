Hatewave spew forth totally crushing math/speed/avant/noise/metal/grind.  Furious and brutal and violent and frightening. Pulverising riffs, blazing speed, calculus-style time shifts and a barely-under-the-surface free-jazz obsession. Pure fucking intense aggression, total hatred and extreme chaotic annihilation.

    Featuring drummer Weasel Walter (Flying Luttenbachers, Lake of Dracula, To Live And Shave in L.A.).
