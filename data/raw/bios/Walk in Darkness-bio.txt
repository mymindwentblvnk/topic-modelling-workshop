Walk In Darkness is a gothic metal band from Italy, started in 2015.
Walk in Darkness constantly evolves,  although it has originally  approached the gothic metal genre, it diverged from it to more original and unpredictable paths following the emotional and psychedelic component of music.
Faceless musicians, among distant and sometimes indefinite guitar arpeggios that blend with distorted and aggressive rhythms and screaming, melancholic and psychedelic solos, with a few notes pushed deep into the soul.  The Dark drums by ARCANUS, with suspended and looming shots, and a wiser use of synth and electronic sounds by ORGANUS (Tio Frank) to replace conventional keyboards, complete the band’s new sound.  WID’s songs have surreal atmospheres and they drag the listener to another dimension as in a psychedelic and schamanic journey through time, a dreamlike journey but only in appearance because the dream is lucid and plausible. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/WALK+IN+DARKNESS">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
