Necronemesis was conceived in the year 2000 by the name Nemesis. Vini(vokills) and Jayson (axe) came up with the idea of making the band but it stood there as an idea. That was until Raymond (drums) knew Jayson and Vini, so it started from there. Later on Vini's cousin Danny(Bass) joined the band. We started as a thrash/crust-core band until we realized we wanted something more aggressive, something more violent, something that would express well our hate for society and our obsession with death. That was when death metal came to our lives and changed everything. The rest is historyâ€¦ Since then, it has been a death metal band that mixes the new extreme technical and brutal with the old school that is being forgotten each passing day. Necronemesis is a band that doesn't take shit from anyone and it's a force to be reckoned with, we're here to stay and slay!
