El Mató a un Policía Motorizado is an argentine rock band from La Plata, Argentina, born in 2003. Their music is mostly influenced by 90's american indie bands. They file their music under the indie-barrial putting themselves closer to an international indie-rock style, rather than the local.

They are Santiago Motorizado (bass and vocals), Doctora Muerte (drums), Niño Elefante (guitar), Chatrán Chatrán (keyboards) and Pantro Puto (guitar).
