Mirwais (b. Mirwais Ahmad-zai, in Switzerland - aka Mirwais Ahmadzaï), is a Paris, France producer & songwriter. He is a leader in French-style progressive electronic dance music / progressive electronica. A former member of the defunct 1980s group Taxi Girl, he was re-discovered (by Madonna, in the late 90s), when he submitted a demo to Maverick.

He signed to Sony for his US album release Production which spawned two club hits, "Disco Science" and "Naïve Song". "Disco Science" appeared in the Guy Ritchie film Snatch.

Madonna however managed to recruit him for writing and production collaboration on her three albums Music, American Life and Confessions on a Dance Floor. Credits include both title tracks plus the interesting and catchy "Impressive Instant", "Don't Tell Me", "Hollywood", "Nobody Knows Me", "Love Profusion", "Nothing Fails" and the eerie "Paradise (Not for Me)".

He was also involved in the writing and production of the title track to the movie James Bond: Die Another Day, sung by Madonna.
