Guided by Voices may be over, but the Robert Pollard song factory hasn't slowed production. The latest release in the Fading Captain series of moonlighting projects is a one-off collaborative studio session with power pop cult figure Tommy Keene, to which Pollard contributes lyrics and vocals while Keene chimes in with the catchy tunes. It all works marvellously well, with Keene providing snappy three-minute pop gems so Pollard can spout charming word associations without having to concern himself with details like bridges, codas, instrumental segues and such. Blues And Boogie Shoes is not at all the typically lo-fi hodgepodge of half-baked ideas and leftovers, but rather a thoughtfully constructed set of cultivated pop with the album's centrepiece, Island Of Lost Lucys, being one of Pollard's finest recorded moments in years. You'll be humming it for months.
