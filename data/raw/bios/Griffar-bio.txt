GRIFFAR was formed in 1997 in Paris by Drakhian (BLACK DEMENTIA and session guitarist for TAAKE during the 2001 Unholy Metal Crusade tour in Germany), Hellskrim (Vocals), Maldoror (Drums) and Krakken (bass guitar). In 2000, the band releases its first demo tape called Of Witches and Celts self-produced and recorded at MusicLive studios. The demo received a very good response from the underground scene. Due to the melodic but yet aggressive music GRIFFAR provides, distributors and magazines compared GRIFFAR to the Scandinavian scene and especially to bands such as DISSECTION. Thanks to its great amount of contacts, GRIFFAR spread no less than 800 copies of its first demo-tape. In 2002, the Greek label ISO666 offered GRIFFAR to re-issue Of Witches and Celts in a CD format which came out with a new layout in june of 2002. The first 1000 copies were quickly sold out through many distributors worldwide. Therefore, ISO666 asked GRIFFAR permission to release a 1000 new copies. Later in 2005, Drakhian and Hellskrim decided to give a new life to the band by recruiting Alsvid on the drums (ex-SETH, ENTHRONED, FORNICATION). GRIFFAR started to compose new songs and rehearse in Bordeaux with session musicians for upcoming concerts . As GRIFFAR gathered enough material for its first album, the band recorded this Promo CD in march 2006 with Philippe Michon (live sound engineer of metal hardcore band DAYS OF DECLINE). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Griffar">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
