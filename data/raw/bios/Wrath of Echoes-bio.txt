Formed in 2014 in Quebec City Canada, WRATH OF ECHOES features current members of Canadian occult metal outfit DOOM'S DAY & DAEDALEAN COMPLEX.
2015 was mostly spent to perfect the songs for a forthcoming release.
A video/single of the song "A Fading Bloodline" was shot and released in the spring of 2016.
With a sound rooted in Finnish Doom metal (Swallow The Sun, Insomnium, Amorphis), the band landed a deal with Quebec based label PRC Music and recorded their first EP, "A Fading Bloodline", in the summer of 2016 for a release in January 2017. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wrath+Of+Echoes">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
