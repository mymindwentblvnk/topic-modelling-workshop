Joachim Witt (born 22 February 1949 in Hamburg, Germany) is a German musician and actor. Witt started his music career in 1977, and became a major star of the German pop scene during the 1980s with huge hits such as "Tri Tra Trullala (Herbergsvater)" and "Goldener Reiter". He was one of the biggest names of the Neue Deutsche Welle (New German Wave).

Witt was the guitarist/singer in Seventies Krautrock band Duesenberg. He released three albums with them, "Duesenberg" (1977), "Duesenberg 2" (1978) and "Strangers" (1979), before embarking on a solo career as a singer and actor.

He made a big comeback at the end of the 1990s, when he scored a major hit with "Die Flut", a duet with Peter Heppner, the singer of popular German synth pop group Wolfsheim. Witts album Bayreuth Eins (1997) scored platinum in Germany and Austria. Bayreuth zwei and Bayreuth 3 followed two resp. eight years later. His music in those days resembled the hard hitting sounds of Rammstein, albeit with a gothic touch, that owed a lot of inspiration to legendary German composer Richard Wagner.
