Arcwelder are a Minneapolis trio who began under the moniker Tilt-a-Whirl in 1988. Drummer/singer Scott MacDonald was a veteran of the Minneapolis scene serving time in numerous bands including Red Letter Day and Velvet Elvis before hooking up with bassist/guitarist Rob Graber to form Arcwelder. Rob enlisted the services of his brother Bill Graber who promptly took up bass, guitar, and occasional singing. The Graber brothers switched between bass and guitar and Scott and Bill traded off vocal duties. Their catalog is still a favorite amongst many indie cadres. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Arcwelder">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
