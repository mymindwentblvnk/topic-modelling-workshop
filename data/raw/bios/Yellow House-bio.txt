Yellow House is the recording project of Cape Town based singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist, Emile van Dango.

Having spent years honing his craft as a folk musician, Yellow House carves out a broader space, a home of artistic experimentation and endless possibility. A haven which currently exists as the headquarters for Emileâ€™s new Dream Pop/Psychedelic Soul visions. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Yellow+House">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
