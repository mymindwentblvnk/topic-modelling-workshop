Llorah started around 2 years ago after a bunch of nerds (affected at various levels) decided to leave their favorite message board to form a new band. Without having any precise idea of what would come up, they just decided to let things come. After a string of bass players and singers was tried on, the line up got stable around february 2005 when 2 other nerds who knew the other ones from seeing them at shows and on the message board joined the band. After a few rehearsals the main influences appeared as being Breach, Cult of Luna or Knut plus a serious will to write songs to which they could headbang as hard as their neck could decently endure. The band had few shows in winter 2005 but eventually realized how much they suck, or well at least that they were far from being ready for that, and decided to rehearse more before having new attempts. Meanwhile they recorded their debut EP in summer 2006. They started to hit the stage again in fall 2006 with acts such as Overmars, Made out of babies, Moho, Celeste but also Appollonia with whom they share a common geek attitude. They found much more rewarding echoes on the shows. The EP finally was finally out in the beginning of february 2007, and the band is now ready to rock out any stage smaller than 10 square meters. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Llorah">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
