Charlotte Brandi and Matze Pr√∂llochs met each other in theaters. They made music for plays, they liked each other's ideas and sounds, they found ways to create the time and space for their own works. They travelled; they recorded and freed themselves from the basics that brought them together, mile by mile by mile. As Me And My Drummer they found a unique sound and style and language - a special language as it only exists between two truly like-minded and different people.

Me And My Drummer are pianos, synths, vocals and drums, talent and honesty. Their music is open about its origins, bearing the dents and scars of every argument about sounds, words and structures as well as the aurora borealis-like beauty of every agreement and every epiphany. Today, Me And My Drummer give birth to a debut album that ties all of this band's works, accomplishments, victories and creative bloodsheds into ten masterful works, into one powerful music. Beautiful, giant music that wears its history and its origins in its hair like shreds of skin, old and too small. Music that shines in the light of its own sun.

The Hawk, The Beak, The Prey is a highly personal thing. Charlotte Brandi's voice spreads out, open and full of images, demanding and giving out magic and life and love and faith and soul. Drums and keys carry this colossal song through the world, slowly and patiently like wandering mountains. Through places and phases, Me And My Drummer have pursued and found themselves to now pour their essence onto a debut album without example. A force, a demand, a flame, an outrageous pop music.
