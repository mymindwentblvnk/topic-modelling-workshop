Avantasia, from Germany, is the side-project of Edguy singer Tobias Sammet, founded in 1999. Two concept albums were released (The Metal Opera, The Metal Opera Pt. II), their structures similar to that of an opera. Both can be classified as Power Metal and/or Symphonic Metal. After the second album, Sammet announced that there would not be any more Avantasia albums. However, in January 2008 a third album was released, titled The Scarecrow. On November 16th 2007 two 6-track albums Lost in Space Part 1 and Lost in Space Part 2 were released. On April 2nd 2010 two new full-length albums were released, The Wicked Symphony and Angel of Babylon, completing the Scarecrow Trilogy. In March 2011 the first Avantasia live CD and DVD called The Flying Opera were released. The contents were based on the footage taken during The Scarecrow tour in 2008, recorded on Wacken Open Air (Germany) and Masters of Rock (Vizovice, Czech Republic) music festivals. In 2013 Avantasia released their sixth album, The Mystery of Time. Their seventh album, Ghostlights was released on 29 January 2016.
