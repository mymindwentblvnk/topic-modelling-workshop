Although all the members of the present line-up have a previous musical history, they started as The Zeronaut in the summer of 1999 in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. By those dates the group, called at that time Scythe, was formed by: Victor Nassar (Karkoma, Insomnia…): bass and voice; Ruymán Santana (Insomnia): guitar; and Héctor Lorenzo (Hydra): drums. With this lineup, the band recorded its first work “Nightscythe” during the summer of 2000. Although it was autoreleased, with the limitations that this entails, received very good critics in general (Bloody´zine, Rock Hard, The Sentinel webzine, etc). 

In spite of having a set sufficiently extensive to make live performances, the need of a second guitar made that impossible. For that reason they put themselves in contact with several guitarists to occupy the vacant position. Finally was Fran González (ex-Norbac), in March of 2001, who became the new guitarist.

With the incorporation of this new member and with renewed forces, the group began its walk in Gran Canaria's scene. Meanwhile, the work in the studio had not stopped with the composition of new songs for a new work. On November of 2003 Hector Lorenzo leaves the band by personal issues. His position was quickly occupied by Kuly Rivero, drummer with unquestionable experience in bands like Phoeticide, Almen or Hipospadia. That same year by coincidence with another german band Scythe changes its name by The Zeronaut.

The Zeronaut has a defined style, pure Melodic Death Metal where predominate fast and forceful riffs, gutural voices and very technical and demolishing drumming, pure Swedish Death Metal style. Their influences are groups like: In Flames, Soilwork, Arch Enemy, The Haunted, Megadeth, The Crown, Carcass… in general, the great bands of the Nordic Metal scene.
