The band  plays in atmospheric post black metal genre adding the sympho, avangarde, dark, brutal, and even hardcore elements to their music and inheriting traditions of Emperor, Ihsahn, Satyricon, Asgaroth and Enslaved. 
The band's lyrics (in english) are just philosophic thoughts and emotions of mere people - hatred, insanity, self-devastation, hopelessness - often mixed with nature and epic tematics.
