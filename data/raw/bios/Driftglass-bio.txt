Driftglass planted its roots in the Canadian prog metal scene more than a decade ago, but after several lineups and band names, the current incarnation of the band was born in Toronto in 2008.

With every band member possessing a different musical background and taste, the diversity of the band's sound became the glue that held it together.

The band released its debut album in 2014.
