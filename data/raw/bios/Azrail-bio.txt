-       As of January 2010, the band has officially broken up.
-Azrail the band was officially formed back in early 2006, with only 2 members the vocalist Joel (RSA) & bassist Ollie (NAM), they were the remnants from a host of previous bands they had been a part of… 
-Shortly after both of them went into their 3rd year of study they met & recruited Riaan Smit (NAM), as their guitarist… Eventually after jamming together for a couple of months, with Ollie even trying his hand at playing the drums they met & recruited Drummer Marius Theron (RSA). 
-Most of us met through college as we all dabbled in Sound Engineering, it was inevitable we recruit & start a band through this medium. 

-Early 2007 saw the addition of Sergio (NAM) joining the band as our second guitarist, this has only progressed our sound further & made it more intense yet more intricate…2007 also see Azrail finally playing live shows after a year of jamming in studio.

-2008 saw Azrail playing Metal 4 Africa 2 Summerfest to an Awesome crowd & unfortunatly the departure of sergio to the Marine Corp in Iraq we have welcomed the addition of Perti Coetzee(RSA) as our new lead guitarist who has added another new dimension to our sound, his debut will be on our Port Elizabeth tour, this sees us coming back to Cape Town playing back to back shows the following week, watch this space.
