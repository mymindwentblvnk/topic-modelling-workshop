Together since 2005, Waking Ruins has been compared by fans and critics to such illustrious bands ranging from As I Lay Dying and Shadows Fall to Unearth and Lamb of God. Though comparisons can be made, it is impossible to fully capture the awe that vocalist Brandon Connor inspires as he screams his heartfelt lyrics aloud. Guitarists Dion Larson and Craig Spencer captivate audiences with each melodic riff that falls from their fingertips while drummer Kane Carmody provides the backbone that holds this intensely driven metal quartet together.

With inventive songwriting and live performances that’ll blow minds and break hearts (and bones), it comes as no surprise that critics and fans agree Waking Ruins is set to be a huge part of Madison’s and soon, America’s metal scene. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Waking+Ruins">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
