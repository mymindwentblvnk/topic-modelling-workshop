Vocalist Fairy Whisper and guitarist Janne V채h채aho started to assemble a new band, when their old band called Empress stopped its journey. The idea of creating melodic metal with female vocals brought couple musicians to audition for the new band and to show their best skills. 
After their numerous search the first line-up was formed, Vocals Fairy Whisper, 1st Guitar Janne V채h채aho, 2nd Guitar Henri Kotipelto, Bass-guitar Janne Saikkonen, Drums Joonas Vainio and synthesizer Oskar Ketola. 

The new band was called In Memorial.
In Memorial made their first Promo-CD called "My Personal Reality" in February 2007. 

In 2008 band had some trouble with line up, when some members left from the band and after that band splitted.
