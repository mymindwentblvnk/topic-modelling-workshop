Way back, in the early 2013's, a new, and loud sound was born in a little
backyard barn in a far away town called Aarle-Rixtel.
They were producing what they would call 'Good Music'.
The brothers Tom and Gijs de Jong, and their cousin Timo van Lierop were feeling so groovy with their instruments, that they decided to form a new musical collective, called MOOON.
