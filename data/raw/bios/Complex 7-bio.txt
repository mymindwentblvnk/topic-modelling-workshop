Complex 7 are a technical metal band from Germany, reccomended for fans of prog and thrash metal bands, like Voivod, Mekong Delta, Depressive Age etc. Complex 7 are not aiming to fit into the actual trends.Even though the music includes ambitious technical phrases and complex structures it is far more heavy than so called progressive-metal.

In july 2001 Complex 7 released their first full-length-CD "Water", providing a survey of the bands work so far (check out the songs at audio). This debut-cd gained very positive reactions worldwide and also a lot of airplay, in both national and international radio-stations. Late 2002 Complex 7 and "Water" won fourth place at the Drum-Demo-Listening-Session (organized by MoStar Promotions) at the Hard 'n' Heavy category.

Since November 1. 2003 the band's second output "Process" is now available. The production of the cd has again been self financed and its eight songs show Complex 7 as skilled songwriters. The hitting compact arrangements, seriously upgraded, often harmonized vocals and an overall richer sound should make "Process" find even more friends as "Water" did before.
