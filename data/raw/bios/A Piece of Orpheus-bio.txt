A Piece Of Orpheus emerged in mid-2008, after a restart between Joop and Rene, it turned out that they had a shared passion in making their own rock songs with a firm bite. Shortly after, three additional musicians were found, and so A Piece Of Orpheus was born.

In 2009, when the band existed for just half a year, they won the Monsterpop competition. The prize money was invested in the “Remains of a Masterpiece" EP (2010).

In 2011 the bass player left the band, and shortly after they found Erwin. In 2012 another change, when the guitar player left the band, and was replaces by Tiago after some auditions. After a period of intense rehearsing the band was ready to hit the stage again by September 2012.

Their songs are difficult to describe. There are some ballads, as well as songs with metal and symphonic influences. The lyrics, written by Lisette, are semi - autobiographical, but written is such a way that anyone can relate. In short, A Piece Of Orhpeus is a passionate group of musicians, who will make themselves heard.
