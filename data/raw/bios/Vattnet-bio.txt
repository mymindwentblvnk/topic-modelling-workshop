Vattnet (Swedish for water) was a metal band from Plaistow, New Hampshire. They formerly performed a mixture of sludge and black metal under the name Vattnet Viskar (The Water Whispers), under which they released a demo, an EP, two full-lengths, and an anthology; the name change accompanies a shift in style, with perhaps the most radical difference being the band's incorporation of clean vocals. The new style had elements of post-rock, shoegaze, post-hardcore, and progressive rock, though it still retained metal elements as well. The band released a single, "Dark Black", and a self-titled album, Vattnet, under the Vattnet moniker, both in 2017. In 2018, guitarist Chris Alfieri announced the band's breakup on Twitter. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vattnet">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
