Like a piece of art with as many interpretations as people who view it, Sneaks’ music is kaleidoscopic, completely unique to the listener. Between responsibility, laughter samples, and charming vocals lies one club banger, your little sister’s anti-meat school lunch protest song, a 55-second epic bass surprise, and a lot of sincerity.
