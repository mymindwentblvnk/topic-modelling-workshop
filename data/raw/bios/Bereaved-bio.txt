BEREAVED formed in January,1997, in Tokyo, Japan. Tetsu Haramura(Vo & Gt) and Bill Jokela(Ba) began writing material with lots of melodies, harmonies. In early 1999 the band had their first show in Sangenjaya(Tokyo). But after show, first drummer left the band.

In 2000, Tetsu devoted all of his energies to vocals, Ken Kubo joined as a parmanent guitarist. And the band played a couple of high profile shows for which they recruited Keisuke Tsuboi of Vomit Remnants to assist on drums. They headlined a show in Nagoya in April and opened for Ritual Carnage and Krabathor in Takadanobaba (Tokyo). After these shows, Norikazu "Tahke" Takenaka joined.

Bereaved entered the studio in the Spring of 2001 to record their first demo, Reclaim. Naoya Hamaii from Ritual Carnage agreed to record the drums for the five song effort.

Reclaim garnered the band its first international recognition as the French magazine Metallian selected Bereaved to compete in its Best Unsigned Band competition. In the fall of 2001, Leone Wakiya joined the band, giving the band. In the Fall of 2003, Bereaved began the process of recording the next CD, which was finally released in June, 2004. The CD, What the Wolf Brings, was released by Frantic Blade Productions, the bandâ€™s own label and brought much stronger reaction from labels than Reclaim had.

What the Wolf Brings also scored the band its first contract, signed with Deadsun Records in France. Bereaved released their first length album, "The Spirit Driven by Hate" in 2007 and are currently working on their second full length album titled "The Cries of the Penitent". It is scheduled to be out sometime in 2010.
