Ryan Monroe is one of the great emerging songwriters of our time.  Currently lending skills as a keyboardist to Sub-Pop recording artists Band Of Horses, Ryan's other projects have included Captain Easy, Evergreen, and The Ryan Monroe Pangroid Band.  

Monroe's music is rooted in composition that can be compared to an array of artists ranging from Billy Joel to TV On The Radio.  His inventive style, however, can only be attributed to the unique workings of his own demented mind. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ryan+Monroe">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
