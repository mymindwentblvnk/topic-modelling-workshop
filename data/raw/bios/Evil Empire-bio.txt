Evil Empire is eight people from the Chicago suburbs. We have different interests, opinions, and personalities. We play music together to promote peace, knowledge, and truth. We don't care if you're into hardcore or emo. In fact, we don't give a motherfuck. Just keep things real, stand up for what's right. - Fuck all inequalities, smash imperialism, keep it real, have fun. That's our stance. Teach yourself. - Evil Empire
