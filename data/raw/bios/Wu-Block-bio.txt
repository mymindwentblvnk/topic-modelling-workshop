Wu-Block, is a collaborative studio album by American rappers Ghostface Killah and Sheek Louch. Louch announced the album in 2011, in an interview. The album is slated for release on November 13, 2012.

Wu-Block's title is a portmanteau, which derives from Ghostface and Sheek's respective groups Wu-Tang Clan and D-Block (better known as The LOX). The album was originally going to be a collaboration by various members of Wu-Tang Clan, Ghostface, Raekwon, Cappadonna and all three members of D-Block. But it ended up being narrowed down to just Ghostface and Sheek. However, the album's title track features the original lineup, except for Cappadonna, and various members from both camps make appearances.

In 2011, Sheek stated that him and Ghostface are about 8 songs deep into the album. Guests on the album (except for various Wu-Tang members amd the rest of D-Block) have not been announced thus far. Producer Red Spyda, with whom Sheek Louch has frequently collaborated with, will produce on Wu-Block, as will RZA, Termanology, and others.
