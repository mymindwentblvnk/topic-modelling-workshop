Boulder is a metal/'stoner rock' (loosely used) based band who formed 1991 hailing from Aurora, OH, USA. The band released their final single in 2005.

Boulder has released well over a dozen demos, singles and albums over their 14 year tenure. the 'Ripping Christ' CD compiled the following releases: "555" 10", "Hot, Sweet and Sticky" cassette, "94 Jailbreak - Dave Holocaust is a Lucky Man" cassette, "Fistful of Scum" 7", "Pilzner's Bible" from split 7" w/ Sloth and "We Like No Hero" from the Ohio Kings comp.

The three full lengths include: 'The Rage of it All', 'Ravage and Savage', and 'Reaped in Half'. the first two albums were compiled on one CD entitled 'Ravage and Savage' but both appear separately on vinyl. Their very last release was an ultra limited 'acetate' 7" limited to 26 copies which contained two Saxon cover songs.

Boulder did two side projects;Sweet Roxx and Motorhead USA. Motorhead USA's sole release was a front-to-back remake of Mot√∂rhead's 'Ace of Spades' album in LP format limited to only 100 copies. Sweet Roxx's release was that of a two song single.

The bassist/ vocalist, Jamie, went on to form Midnight and currently plays in Abdullah, Destructor, Toxic Holocaust (touring bassist only), and Terminal Lovers.
