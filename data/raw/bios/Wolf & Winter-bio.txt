Line-up:
Haegl (Vocals, Drums)
Managarmr (Guitar, Bass)

In the city of Bah√≠a Blanca, Argentina, in the year of 2005, Haegl joined forces with Managarmr and created Wolf & Winter.
Their music could be described as a spectrum of harsh sounds and cold climates with melodies born from a concept of agony and pain, where the character of the Wolf appears as the representative of an almost extinct breed in woods that limit with the frozen shores of the band's native Argentina. Lyrical themes include pagan poetry, loneliness, hatred, evil and death, classic topics of black metal. Wolf & Winter's first album is entitled "Endless Forest of Silent Sorrow...The Howl of Hate" and has been released by Furias Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/WOLF+&+WINTER">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
