Heading for maximum orchestral Black Metal aggression the German one man piece GERNOTH combines fast and brutal blast beat attacks with a gloomy, morbid atmosphere and bizarre guitar-riffing. It's that specific contrast between true violent Black Metal on the one hand side and artful, complex and classically inspired harmonies on the other one that give GERNOTH's music its unique shape and individuality.

The person behind GERNOTH is guitarist/vocalist GARRGHOYLE who founded the band - which from the very beginning was meant to be a one man band, and will always be! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gernoth">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
