FORGOTTEN CHAOS was summoned in summer 2003 upon the ashes of
BESTIAL TORMENT in unholy alliance with MOONFROST. they are true disciples of
Old-School Black Metal, combining thrashing skills with eerie pagan tunes.
the debut "victorious among the damned" contains neckbreaking metal madness,
a lyrical concept inspired by archaic poems in forbidden languages and
denial of civilisation:
"we support only true barbarism as natural state of mankind, FORGOTTEN CHAOS
is the hammer on those who play false metal!!!" <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Forgotten+Chaos">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
