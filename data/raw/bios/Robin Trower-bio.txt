Robin Trower (born March 9, 1945 in Catford, England) is a British blues rock guitarist who achieved success with Procol Harum during the 1960's, and then again as the leader of his own power trio.

Perhaps Trower's most famous album is Bridge of Sighs (1974). This album, along with his first (Twice Removed from Yesterday) and third (For Earth Below) solo albums, was produced by his former Procol Harum band mate, organist Matthew Fisher.

Those who favor electric guitarists who can play live what they record in the studio will be very impressed with the "Robin Trower Live" album - especially the cut "Daydream".  While often compared to Jimi Hendrix, Robin Trower never received the publicity nor same volume of fans. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Robin+Trower">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
