DEAD SUMMER SOCIETY is a gothic/doom/dark metal one-man project from Italy. 

THE HEART OF AUTUMNSPHERE, the 2010 instrumental demo, is a journey through a liquid dimension which hasn't got any boundaries, excepting those belonging to Dream and Imagination. 
A soundscape suspended between cold atmospheres and epic outbreaks, whose theme meets with yearning and darkness, nostalgia and dreaming reflections. 

A full-lenght debut album is on the way...I'm now working with singers to add vocals to my musicâ€¦stay in touch!
