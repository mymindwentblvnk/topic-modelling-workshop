Suspiria Profundis is the sole concept of Azazel, founder of other such projects as Dusk and Absum. The idea to create the project known as Suspiria Profundis came to Azazal in 2006 and to use the project as a form of spiritual warfare. It took Azazel almost two years to write and record the warfare that has been created on his debut album, "In War Against Satan". Taking influences from artists such as Horde, Elgibbor, Antestor and the like, Azazel has laid down 8 tracks of supreme black metal. Sullen Records took notice to the project in August of 2008, and quickly contacted Azazel about the release of, "In War Against Satan". A deal was stuck, and in the fall of 2008 the album will be released via a limited pressing of 250 units. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Suspiria+Profundis">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
