Hellmetall (often written as Hell Met All) initially composed songs in German and English before settling entirely to the Resian dialect, derived from Slovene, spoken in their homeland in the most North-Eastern part of Italy. Since the band's lyrics are based on the World Wars and on European military history, the members use to wear military clothing while performing. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/HellMetAll">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
