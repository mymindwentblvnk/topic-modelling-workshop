A Shattered Reflection was formed December 0f 2006. It started as a 6 member band but then got cut down to 5 band members. The band then continued to make music not only as a metalcore/hardcore band but also as a Christian band. We base all our music on god. He is a influence in everything we do and will continue doing for this band. With our love for music and god we will keep pushing to spread the word of god and to spread our love for music to everyone out there.As we have said plenty of times over and over,"If you want to ask us anything please do so, and don't be afriad to critisize us because we are a christian band. We are used to being under the magnifying glass." We aren't afriad of anything and we won't back down anytime soon.We enjoy what we do and nothing can change that. God bless you all ~A Shattered Reflection
