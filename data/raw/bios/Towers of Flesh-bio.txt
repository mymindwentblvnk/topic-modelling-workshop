Towers Of Flesh is a blackened death metal act formed in Birmingham, UK. The trio was founded on a wholly unconventional writing dynamic in the sense that all musical duties were to be split between two members. The bands debut album 'The Perpetual Paradox' was mastered by Mick Kenney (Anaal Nathrakh) and recorded in two split sessions; the first in July '09 and the second in September '09 at Hellfire studios in Birmingham (previously done work for Motorhead, Immortal and Orange Goblin). It was released through the Midlands based label Dissected Records and received highly enthusiastic reviews throughout the underground music scene.

Although the band has played live extensively in support of the debut album it seems as though appearances on the live circuit have become rare. However, all members have remained prominent in the UK underground and stand assured in belief that they have been successful in amalgamating their influences and creating something fresh and invigorating for the listener with this upcoming release.
