The most promising new Black Metal band from Serbia, Oksanat (formed in 2001), consists of two members only, Dragan on strings and Aleksandar on keyboards and vocals.Oksanat so far released one, three song, demo ‘Ragusini Anonymi’ in 2002 and material for debut full length CD ‘Aurora’. CD is released through Grom Records.Influences range from standard epic Black Metal sounds, to raw, chaotic bands, but key spice is incorporated spirit of ancient Serbia and Byzantine-like sounds and atmospheres. Altogether this makes a perfect blend of traditional medieval Serbian atmospheres and modern, blasting Black Metal. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Oksanat">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
