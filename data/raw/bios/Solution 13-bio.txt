Solution 13 is a metal band from the capital of Finland's metalscene Oulu. Band was formed in October 2000, When drummer Tape Kanerva got together with guitarist Petri Sääskö and vocalist Ilkka Järvenpää. Band started to write songs with an idea to make music that had the anger and energy of metal and the groove of rock. Band decided to record a demo CD in the beginning of 2001. The band needed a bass player at these sessions, and asked for their friend Sami Kukkohovi, the bass player of one of Finlands biggest metal bands Sentenced, to handle the bass duties in the studio. He agreed, and during this session he actually joined the band as a permanent member. This was the actual beginning of Solution 13.

After the recording of first demo CD, the band started intense song writing process, and hit the studio once again during the summer 2001. As a result of that session, band got one song included at "the best of unerhört CD" which was included in a german metal magazines RockHard's february of 2002 issue. During the winter of 2001/2002 band also started to work on their debut album at the Neo Studios in Oulu, Finland with the help ofproducer Kari Vähäkuopus. During this time Kukkohovi also picked up guitar, his first Instruments again white also handling the bass playing.

Until this moment the band (YES this is a REAL band not a Project) has kept a very low profile, but that all is going to change with the release of Solution 13's debut album. Solution 13's debut album features 11 hard hitting metal songs written by the band themselves that are bound to make you bang your headâ€¦
