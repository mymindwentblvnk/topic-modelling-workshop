Jon Lajoie, born and raised in Montreal, Canada, is the third in a family of nine children. He graduated from Dawson College’s theatre/ninja assassin program in 2001, and immediately started booking assassination work, incidentally putting his acting career on the back burner. Between 2001 and 2007 Jon Lajoie assassinated (in a ninja-like fashion) an estimated 40 000 people, and an estimated 9000 fish (in early 2004 demand for assassination was low, so for 3 months, he held a part-time job as a fisherman).

In June of 2007, he decided to start making videos and posting them on his YouTube-channel. The videos were so well received that he put “assassinating people in a ninja-like fashion” on hold, and began getting drunk all the time. A few months later he decided to only get drunk once in a while and to restart making videos.

in 2010, Jon got lost and wandered on to a Hollywood television set.  People assumed he was supposed to be there.  They started calling him Taco, and he started responding to the name.  He hasn't left the set since.  No one really knows if he's aware that he's on a TV show. 

Lajoie has released 2 studio albums and 8 singles.
