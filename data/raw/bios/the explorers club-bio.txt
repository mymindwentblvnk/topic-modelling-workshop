The Explorers Club is an indie pop band currently based in Nashville, TN, though originating in the mid 00's out of Charleston, SC, with a The Beach Boys-influenced sound. The band's first full length album, "Freedom Wind," was released in May, 2008, by Dead Oceans records and received critical acclaim, as well as sync opportunities in film and television.

Their second album, Grand Hotel, released in early 2012, moved them out of Beach Boys sound-alike status and married their surf sounds with a playful/respectful homage to legends like Burt Bacharach, Neil Diamond and The Grass Roots.

A third album, Together, was issued in 2015 and continued to deliver a "firmly rooted in the styles of the late 60's/early 70's. 

In 2019, band leader Jason Brewer issued a cover of the Scott Walker classic, "The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine Anymore," and announced the forthcoming release of two albums worth of material in early 2020, one  being a "covers" album and the other being all original new music..
