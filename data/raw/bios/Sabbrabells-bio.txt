Sabbrabells were a Japanese heavy metal band. The band formed in 1980 and disbanded in 1988. They were considered, alongside heavy metal stalwarts Anthem (Jpn) and Reaction (Jpn) as being among one of the most important bands in the Kanto (East Japan, Tokyo-Yokohama area) metal movement, which was seen to be a rival movement to the Kansai (West Japan, Osaka-Kyoto-Kobe area) metal movement.
