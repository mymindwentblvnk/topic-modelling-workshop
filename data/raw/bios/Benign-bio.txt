Benign is the studio project of musician Tim Goodacre, an Australian, residing in London, UK. The music is the product of a fusion of styles, from the dark electronic pop-rock twistings of Nine Inch Nails and Depeche Mode to the subtle musings of contemporary masters like Elbow and David Sylvian. Benign forges a new style that refuses to be categorised: drawn from many influences, from rock, pop, and world-music heritage, melded together for a fresh sound.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Benign">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
