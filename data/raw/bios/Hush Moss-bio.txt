Hush Moss is the brainchild of Eden Leshem, a 23-year-old Israeli living in Berlin. He recorded It Takes a Lot in a studio by the ocean in Israel, all the better to achieve that coked-up rolled-up-jacket-sleeve 70s musician vibe.

The lineup: Eden Leshem (vocals, guitar), Aviv Meshulam (guitar, synth, percussion), Dekel Adin (bass), Guy Fleisher (drums), Guy Gefen (congas), Dolev Nahoom Sanbira (saxophone), Ziv Sobelman Yamin (keys). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hush+Moss">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
