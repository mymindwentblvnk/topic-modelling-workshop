Final Sacrifice - polish metal band, formed in 2007 in Pozna≈Ñ(Poland). Before that the band went through few serious line-up changes and drifted away towards heavier and more brutal sound.

Intense touring was the bands main dish since late 2008 up to the very end of 2009. FS toured Poland from north to south, east to west and also played two gigs in Germany. The bands first EP also went out in 2009. Now, at the beginning of 2010 Final Sacrifice is a solid machine, working on full throttle with power that cannot be denied by anyone who had seen them live.

They have just posted their new single, which is a hint of direction that their music is taking. 

 For fans of I Killed The Prom Queen, The Eyes Of a Traitor and Bring Me The Horizon.
