Swedish-born guitarist Jonas Hansson delivers an eighteen track collection of all-original neo-classical pieces featuring crying wah-wah and fiery electric guitar work balanced by emotional acoustic melodicism and classical instrumentation. Entitled Classica, this instrumental CD gives free reign to Hansson's imagination, astonishing musicianship and blazing melodic phrasing as he conducts his way through tracks such as "Overture", "Harpsy", "The Thriller" and the amusing "Cartoon". Dynamic and powerful, Classica is not a form of background music; rather a spatial sonic blast of neo-classicism with Hansson as first chair guitarist and, indeed, the rest of the orchestra as well!  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jonas+Hansson">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
