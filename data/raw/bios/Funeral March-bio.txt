Funeral March formed in 1984 with original members Matt Reese, Marc Balanky, Richard Larabee and Glen Griffin. Soon after, Rob Brown joined, and the band had 2 bass players. Eventually Richard left along with Glen who was replaced by Paul Lisa on guitar. This line up lasted through several shows. Mitch Wilson came aboard as second guitarist. Paul moved on and the final line up was set. The only recording ever released was the Endless Black cassette consisting of 10 songs. Nine originals and a cover of the Bee Gee's "Staying Alive." The band was typical of a time in music when "faster is better". A horror theme prevailed laced with sex, insecurities and a tongue in cheek humorous attitude. ....What have others said?.... .. "Many people comment about a San Diego sound taking form in the late '80s and early '90s, but a common sound is difficult to pinpoint.... Groups like Sub-Society, Socially Insecure, Funeral March, Pitchfork, who later became Rocket From the Crypt, Drive Like Jehu, Inch, and No Knife -- had grown up sharing equipment and rhythm sections and listening to each others' record collections." -- "REAL HARDCORE TRUE PUNK," Daniel Ridge, October 17, 2002 .... "Bands like Neighborhood Watch, Funeral March, Pitchfork, and Dark Sarcasm helped define San Diego’s punk/alternative sound, its members flourishing and later forming bands like Pinback, the Black Heart Procession and the soon defunct Rocket From the Crypt." -- Nathan Lindsay, San Diego’s Underground. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Funeral+March">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
