Beth Jeans Houghton & The Hooves of Destiny is a band formed and led by English singer-songwriter Beth Jeans Houghton. In November 2012, Houghton and her band flew to Los Angeles, California, to record their second album at The Boat studio in Silverlake. While initial sessions went well, Houghton became disenchanted with the sound of the new album and the sessions were cancelled. Since 2014, Houghton has been writing and recording music under the name Du Blonde.

The band includes, in addition to Houghton, Dav Shiel (Drums, Cajon, Keyboard, Vocals, Steel Pan), Rory Gibson (Bass, Vocals), Findlay Macaskill (Violin, Vocals) and Blazey Blazey (Trumpet, Vocals, Guitar, Drums).

In 2012, the band released the album "Yours Truly, Cellophane Nose".  A second album was never finished.
