Kvalvaag is a norwegian Bass player and composer who has been involved in several metal bands in Oslo since 2004.
In 2012 he decided to start is own solo project since he wanted to be in control of all the musical elements himself.
With the help from Ishtar (DÃ¸dsfall, Isolated) on drums and a year with practice on synth, he ended up with the first full length named "Noema"

Line up:
Kvalvaag: Vocals, Guitars, Bass, Synths
Ishtar: Drums
