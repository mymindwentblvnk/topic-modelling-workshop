Appearing from seemingly from nowhere, and hated by all, the original ravens had nothing but Saint Vitus and Black Sabbath on their mind. In 2005 they did record a demo cunningly titled 'Space Raven' and played a couple of shows much to the displeasure of the local pink cider swilling hoodlums who probably wouldn't know real heavy metal if they were run over by the giant cat tank featured on the cover of Defenders of the Faith.

Soon original skinsman Jake "canâ€™t-play-drums-for-shit" Roat was shall we say, "kicked out" of the band and replaced with Matthew Chalk. Under this astute disguise the band played several shows in 2006 with various bands including heavy metal nigels Lord.

In 2007 the band went incognito as the two original members wrote more songs, slowly moving away from their doomed beginnings and leaning towards rocking straight up heavy metal. In late 2007 Chalk was replaced with Tommy "Space Raven" Brockman. And in late 2008 Matt Orreal joined the lineup on second guitar, adding phenomenal might to the bands sound.

In 2009 the band finally plans to begin recording the songs they have been writing for the last 3 years, as well as dominate the live music scene.
