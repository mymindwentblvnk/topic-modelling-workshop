This is a hard to find album in the first place, and finding reviews on it are even harder. But let me tell you this band is down n' dirty southern sludge. It has been on my I-Pod since day 1. You need to check these guys out. A "must have" for fans of Buzzoven or Eyehategod. The title of the album says it all...
