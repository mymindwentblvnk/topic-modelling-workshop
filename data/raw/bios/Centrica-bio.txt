Centrica was born September 2006 when keyboard player Andrea Pavanello and guitarist Giorgio Rovati wrote some music together. Experiencing a dynamic flow of inspiration, they decided to channel their enthusiasm into the album Centrica. These innovative, instrumental compositions comprise their very first progressive rock project. The phenomenon has taken shape and the debut Centrica, with the collaboration of Alberto De Bortoli on bass guitar and Dario Ciccioni on drums, released on november 25th 2008.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Centrica">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
