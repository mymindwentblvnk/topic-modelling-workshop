Biography:

Art Far Away was formed in Gothenburg, Sweden in 2008 with the sole intention of playing earth shaking and mind breaking metal. Through the years they have held on to this simple statement and with very little line up changes continued to aim for this goal. 
What started out as a couple of guys playing metal covers and trying out different styles of music eventually became a well oiled orchestra that broke their own ground musically. With influences from both Swedish and international acts Art Far Away use the full potential of their eight guitar strings and embrace the listener with songs that stir your gut. 

Influences: Influences Burst, Meshuggah, Periphery, Gojira, After the Burial, Veil of Maya, Cult of Luna and many more
