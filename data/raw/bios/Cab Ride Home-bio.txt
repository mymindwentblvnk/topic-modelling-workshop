From their Bandcamp page: Northern Virginia metal band Cab Ride Home represents one thing: partying. We're a five-piece group and all members are committed to ultimately touring full-time. Our sound is drunken thrash metal, our songs are about drinking and our shows are about raging. We've played 120 shows and even toured the U.K. 'Nuff said.

Danica Roem also happens to be the first openly-transgender person serving in a state legislature, following her election defeat of self-described Virginia's Chief Homophobe Bob Marshall on 07-Nov-2017. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cab+Ride+Home">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
