Biography -
Back in 2009 when the scene was full of Death Metal and Thrash Metal bands, Dormant Inferno shocked the audiences by playing a show, exposing the unsuspecting audience to Doom Metal. This was the first time Doom Metal was unleashed upon the masses and many were agape. Dormant Inferno didn't create music for the masses - the band did it for itself, and appreciation was posthumous, so to speak, because the band was on hold ever since the vocalist left for the US.

In 2013, the band showed signs of life, contributing a track to the Motorhead Tribute compilation and assembling a line-up of session musicians to play live again, despite Gautam Shankar being in the US. 

The band has now finished recording songs for a new release, which would be in the form of a split with Pakistani Doom/Black band, Dionysus. The split is expected to be out soon and will be released by Transcending Obscurity Records
