There are several bands using the name: Simulacrum:

1) A real surprise from Slovakia. After a couple of years from their debut cd on OLD EUROPA CAFE', SIMULACRUM returns with a real masterpiece of ritual ambient in vein of best COLD MEAT sound. A symphony that penetrates our souls for heading towards a desolate but uncontaminated world. There isn't any possibility to thought... the only way is to leave himself... and leave the soul fly free... An absolute milestone.

2) Simulacrum is a progressive metal band from Turku, Finland. It originally started off as
a high school band founded 12 years ago by the composer/keyboard player Christian ”Chrism” Pulkkinen. The original line-up had already 3 members of the current one; Chrism, his little brother Nicholas Pulkkinen (guitar) and Olli Hakala (bass). The name Simulacrum was adopted a few years after and the band found a singer, Niklas Broman
to tackle the complex material at hand. Drummer Markus Wallasvaara joined the band
in May 2003 and played the drums on “The Master and the Simulacrum” debut album. Markus left the group in early 2011, but rejoined the band in March 2012.
