Nakkilan  vapaapalokunta (formed in 2006) is a finnish band consisting of revolting AND revolving line-up of members: sometimes it includes humans, sometimes robots, sometimes something between and outside of them. Current line-up has for members; the two founding guys DJ Galabágos and MC isoFox, later on joined Dr Akusti and the allmighty tortoise King TuT.
Everything started as a little private joke between few people and robocops, but once the beats started pumping, everything turned. The little inside gag became something to live for.
The music is inspired by everything around and inside of us, but it's still kept as something you've probably never heard before. Like they say: You can do anything, Nakkilan vapaapalokunta just does it better.
Nakkilan vapaapalokunta is currently writing writing new material for their upcoming summer themed album. Released this Christmas.
