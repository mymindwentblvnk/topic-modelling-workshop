the spirit of the beehive formed in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States in 2014. Like the band's sound, the band's lineup has changed many times, the current members being guitarist/vocalist Zack Schwartz, drummer Pat Conaboy, guitarist/keyboardist Justin Fox, guitarist Tim Jordan, and bassist/vocalist Rivka Ravede. Their 2014 self-titled debut was a fuzzed-out collection of shoegaze and deranged dream pop. Though scuzzy and stoned, moments of twisted beauty and piercing melancholia sprouted from 2017’s lo-fi odyssey, Pleasure Suck; “Just know that if you hate yourself, I hate myself twice as much,” Ravede soberly muttered on the album. By then, Spirit had gained a reputation an indie-rock dark horse, heralded for their enigmatic allure by peers like Mitski and Jay Som. In 2018, the band released its album, Hypnic Jerks, gaining even bolder-named fans including Frank Ocean, who played one of their songs on his radio show. While originally conceived as a demo tape, the record transformed into an ambitious collection that mutates in astonishing directions, moving smoothly from Summer of Love sunshine to angsty pop punk to Deerhunter psychedelia to spasmodic guitar experimentation. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/the+spirit+of+the+beehive">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
