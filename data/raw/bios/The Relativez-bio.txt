The Relativez are Big Wy & Suga Buga - 2 legendary Blood rappers

They are a staple of Los Angeles rap. In the '90s, the world first heard this innovative group on the Banging On Wax albums. After standing out on this popular series, Suge Knight immediately signed them and their momentum became even stronger after their hit street single 'Eastside Westside' started tearing up the clubs and radio air waves. After leaving Death Row, they recorded and released three classic albums. Now they're back with Legendary.
