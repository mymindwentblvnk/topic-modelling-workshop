Mal Blum (born 1988) is an American songwriter and performer from New York[1]

Critics often remark on Blum's strength as a lyricist. They spent their early career promoting self-booked diy solo tours and supporting other solo artists such as Mike Doughty, Melissa Ferrick, Jenny Owen Youngs, Amanda Palmer, and Jeffrey Lewis.

In 2014, Mal Blum signed to Don Giovanni records and announced they would be working on a new album produced by Marissa Paternoster of the band Screaming Females. Before that point, they had never worked with a record label and fan-funded or self-funded recording costs. After the Don Giovanni release of "You Look a Lot Like Me" in 2016 Mal Blum began touring nationally as a three piece with a bassist and drummer, contributing to what critics called a "more developed but still gritty, punk" sound. 

Mal Blum is a recurring musical and non-musical guest on The Chris Gethard Show and has had music featured on Logo TV's The Click List: Top 10 Videos and NewNowNext Music

Blum has contributed non-musical written work to Autostraddle, Huffington Post, and The Fader.

Blum attended State University of New York at Purchase.
