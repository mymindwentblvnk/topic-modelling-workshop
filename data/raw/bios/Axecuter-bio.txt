Pure Heavy Metal Cult from Brazil whose sound and lyrics deal with HEAVY METAL of true kind. (In)Famous for the cover of the EP Raise The Axe where a headbanger is destroying such CD's as Slipknot, System of a Down, Black Label Society and thus mocking the whole "modern metal" concept. They have a couple of EP's, a proper album and an Anthology. The latter and the legendary EP Raise the Axe can both be found on Spotify.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Axecuter">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
