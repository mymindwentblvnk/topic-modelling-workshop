Last Remains is a five piece hardcore/metal band from Ruse, Bulgaria. The band was founded in 2008 by ex-vocalist Mitaka and lead guitarist Ilyo. In 2011 the band released its debut full length album “The False Concept Of Life”, which consists of 10 songs, filled with heavy breakdowns, djent and metalcore riffs, influenced by bands like The Acacia Strain, Impending Doom, Meshuggah and Emmure. In 2012 Last Remains released a split album with a home town fellow hardcore/metal band Overdawn completely free for download - http://www.mediafire.com/?2ob5cu94kmhz579. “Home Court” has 9 songs – 4 of each band and 1 with members from both bands. The split album got some serious reviews in some of Bulgaria’s top music websites and magazines. In 2012 ex-vocalist Mitaka had to leave the band due to some personal issues and his place was taken by Last Remains’ close friend Alex ‘Screamoe’. This line-up change made the band stronger and more productive than ever. In 2013 Last Remains recorded its second full length album, called “Lead the Way”, which will be released May 11, 2013.
