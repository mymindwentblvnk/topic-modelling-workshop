Murder Therapy was formed in Bologna, Italy in October of 2007 when Francesco D'Adamo (also guitars for Cryptic Theory) answered the call of Riccardo Meschiari (vocals) and bassist Simone Esperti (ex Creation of Madness) with the will to create a new Death Metal project. After some month of practice Andrea Cavalieri (drumes) joined. From the beginning of 2008, with the lineup completed the band worked hard on songwriting, performing its first live shows in the Bologna area.

A selection of the written musical material became the band first official release: "The Therapy", recorded at "Lo Studio dell'Arkano" in Altedo, Italy. Having finished the sessions by the end of June of 2008, the result a very personal mixture of Death Metal, blending sounds and atmospheres of American Death bands with twisted, irregular and modern patterns.
