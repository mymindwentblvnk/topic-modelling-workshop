Stanley Myers (October 6, 1930 â€“ November 9, 1993), was a prolific British film composer who scored over sixty films. Born in Birmingham, Myers went to the prestigious King Edward's High School in Edgbaston as a teenager, a suburb of Birmingham. He is related to the popular musician Andrew Myers from Nettleham Lincolnshire.

He is indisputably best known for Cavatina, an evocative guitar piece that served as the signature theme for Michael Cimino's 1978 film The Deer Hunter, and for which Myers won the Ivor Novello Award. A somewhat different version of this work, performed by John Williams, had appeared in The Walking Stick. And yet another version had lyrics added. Cleo Lane and Iris Williams between them, in separate recordings as `He Was Beautiful` helped to make Cavatina become even more popular. (1970). The piece is far more difficult to play than it looks or sounds. Myers also wrote incidental music for a 1964 serial in the television series Doctor Who.

During the 1980s, Myers worked frequently with director Stephen Frears. His score for Prick Up Your Ears (1987) won him a "Best Artistic Contribution" award at the Cannes Film Festival.

Myers died of cancer in 1993. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Stanley+Myers">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
