Weird Totem are a heavy rock band from Heraklion,Crete,Greece.
They were formed in 2005 and since then have tried to play
in almost every gig venues and festivals.
Their fuzzy distorted sound is a raw,underground mixture from
Black Sabbath and the hard/heavy rock scene of the 70's,
to earlier influences of the 90's like Kyuss, Sleep, Orange Goblin,
Down, Electric Wizard, Bongzilla etc.
Their live performances are getting better and every time
more people following the band,forming a family.
In 2011 they released their first EP called "Caravans of Time",
under the label of Razorbleed Productions.
At the time,Weird Totem are focusing on writing new material,
but never forget their passion for live explosions!
Hail the Leaf!
