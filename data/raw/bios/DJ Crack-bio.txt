DJ Crack is one of many aliases used by German hard dance producer Michael Baur.  In 1989, Baur established Manifold Records Music & Marketing in Augsburg and released his first single "I Like The House" as Beatproduction.  As DJ Crack, his first notable release was his hard trance record "Singular" from 1995 which was featured in multiple mixes and compilations including Techno Trance Rave, Tekno Runner, and Cyberworld and was played at the Mayday festival.  As DJ Crack, Baur compiled the Tripnotized and Dolphin Trance album series and Volume 3 of TranzWorld All-Stars. 
Loud Culture, DJ Crack's first album, was released in 1998 to underground acclaim and featured the hit single "Rhythm Take U Higher."  Baur no longer produces as DJ Crack but continues to DJ in the German underground club scene. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/DJ+Crack">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
