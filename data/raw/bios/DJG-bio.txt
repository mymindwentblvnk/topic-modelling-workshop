Born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area, Dean J. Grenier A.K.A DJG landed in the world of Dubstep in 2007 with his first 12”  “Shadow Skanking” b/w “Joyful Sound” on Narco.Hz. Immediate support on Rinse FM and in the clubs from DJ’s like N-Type propelled DJG to the forefront of American dubstep producers early in his career.

DJG’s production style is richly melodic, emotive while full of groove and energy. Recognized early on for a more dubwise sound, DJG’s recent productions have revealed an evolution in his music, getting deeper into bass-heavy, tech-drenched, soulful tracks like the much-anticipated February ‘09 release “Bunker” b/w “Apophenia” on Tube10 and “Avoid The Noid” b/w “Duality” on Pushing Red. DJs ranging from Mary Anne Hobbs, N-Type, Joe Nice, Pinch, Headhunter, LD, Quest, Skream, RSD, 2562, Djunya, Random Trio and many more have been supporting DJG’s recent and forthcoming releases on labels Wheel&Deal, Transistor, Pushing Red, Warm Communications amongst others.

When DJG gets behind the decks, his passion for the music he plays is obvious. His enthusiasm for the deeper side of dubstep and his affection for dance floor selections makes each set a spontaneous combination of the highs and lows that the sound has to offer. 

As of recent, he's also going under the Grenier moniker. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/DJG">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
