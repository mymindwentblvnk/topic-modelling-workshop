His interest in music production peaked when he discovered artists like Floating Points, Mount Kimbie, Lone and Chrome Sparks, who he says are major influences in his music. Self-taught, the Montreal based producer experiments since 2012. He released his first EP, titled Eclipse, in April 2013. At the same period, he has also been composing scores for live plays and advertising. On May 19th 2014, Oda emphasized on the balance between intensity and quiet to characterize the CRiâ€™s workmanship.
