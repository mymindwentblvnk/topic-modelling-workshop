ARFSYND is a Swedish one-man band featuring a multi-instrumentalist Perditor. The debut self-titled full-length was produced by the artist himself and mastered at the legendary Necromorbus studio, so expect a unique and deep sound! Featuring a variety of tempos, sincere, dark and haunting vocals, Perditor's exquisite and already well-known melodies, ARFSYND follows a different yet just as noble path.

Lyrics, entirely written and performed in archaic Swedish, give this ARFSYND a special dimension, a special feeling, which, the author felt, could only be manifested through the use of his mother tongue.

Thus, as you read this message, the ARFSYND's first and eponymous album is finally available for the ears of the eager! CD OUT NOW!
