Breakout is the most famous Polish blues rock band formed in 1968. Formed in 1965 as Blackout. In 1968 the band has changed name to Breakout. The characteristic for Breakout music is sound of Tadeusz Nalepa guitar and voice of Mira Kubasińska. Breakout crash out in 1980. 

After a few years of playing as Blackout, the first performance of Breakout took place on Musicorama festival, in February 1968. In April the new bass player - Michał Muzolf, joined the group. In June the band toured in the countries of Benelux. After the band had returned to Poland, they became one of the most famous Polish rock band, owing much to a new sound-kit brought from the western Europe, but also to the fact that they were arguably the first to play blues rock in Poland.

In November Breakout played a few concerts all around Poland. In January and February 1969 their song Gdybyś kochał, hej! topped the radio chart list.

In 1969 they realised their first album "Na drugim brzegu tęczy", which they had recorded without K. Dłutowski, but with Włodzimierz Nahorny, who played the saxophone and flute. In August Breakout took the new bass-player Piotr Nowak, but just at the beginning of 1970, he was replaced by Józef Skrzek. The same year Franciszek Walicki (manager) left the band.

In 1970 the band was more and more criticised by Polish mass media for pro-West lifestyle and long hair. As a result, the radio and TV stopped broadcasting their songs.

In 1971 Breakout accomplished arguably their best album: "Blues". It was recorded by: Tadeusz Nalepa (vocal , lead guitar), Dariusz Kozakiewicz (guitar), Tadeusz Trzciński (harmonica), Jerzy Goleniewski (bass), Józef Hajdasz (drums).

Next year they recorded their fourth album "Karate". After the recording was finished Jan Izbiński (vocal) joined for a short time. "Karate" turned out to be their best selling work to date. In 1973 year Włodzimierz Nahorny left Breakout, and the musicians helped to record the solo album of Mira Kubasińska "Ogień".

Between 1973 and 1975 the band went on concerts to USSR, GDR and Holland.

Already in 1974 Breakout recorded the next, fifth already, album "Kamienie", which was recorded by: Tadeusz Nalepa (lead guitar, harmonica, vocal), Winicjusz Chróst (guitar), Zdzisław Zawadzki (bass), Wojciech Morawski (drums). 21 November 1974 year the band received the Golden Plate for "Karate". Throughout 1975 there were many personal changes within the band, and at the beginning of the next year the personnel was established as: Mira Kubasińska (vocal), Tadeusz Nalepa (guitar), Zbigniew Wypych (bass), Bogdan Lewandowski (keyboards), Andrzej Tylec (drums). With these members Breakout recorded an album called "NOL".

Fans had to wait till 1979 for the new album. "Żagiel", recorded with Roman "Pazur" Wojciechowski, was a part of the Olympian Triptych prepared for the Olympics 1980 in Moscow, and simultaneously they recorded next album called "SOL".

The band ceased to exist in 1982 when the band leader Tadeusz Nalepa began the solo career.

Till present day the band has been often reactivated for various events and concerts.

19 June 2007 in Rzeszów the Breakout Festival was organized in memory of Mira Kubasińska and Tadeusz Nalepa.
