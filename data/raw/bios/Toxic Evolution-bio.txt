Toxic Evolution is a thrash metal band from Werdau, Saxony, Germany.
After Merlo (Guitars/Vocals) left his old band in 2011, he started playing and writing thrash, as he wanted to do the same thing as his heroes Metallica, Sodom, Kreator, Exodus, Annihilator, ...
In the end of 2011 the demo recordings have begun. It was a process of self-discovery without any goal of a 14-year-old, so that the result should be seen as an experiment - nothing more. "The Soundtrack of Demise" has been digitally released in December 2012.
In august 2013 the band grew by Basti (Bass) and Patrick (Drums). One month later, Nick (Guitars) joined the band.
In 2014, the band parted ways with Basti and Patrick.
In the beginning of 2015, the new bass player Phil joined TE.
Furthermore, a new EP has been recorded in February/March 2015, which determines TE's style - old school thrash without any compromise. Merlo also played the drums on this record, as there was no drummer in the band at this moment.
TE also started playing live shows in 2015 in an alternative line up: Merlo (drums/vocals), Nick (guitars), Phil (bass). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Toxic+Evolution">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
