The band Crystal Wall made its apperance in the metal world in 2003. It is influenced by the 1980 rock music, Heavy, Thrash, Death, Prog, Symphonic, classical and celtic music, and they try to combine technique and melody, as well as a thrash side.

After several line up changes, they played in December 2004 in a Festival with bands such as One O One (NuMetal), TribalTones (Prog/Ska) and Synopsis (Prog). It was the first time Crystal Wall went on stage.
During several months they tried to find the perfect singer and that's why they decided to combine female vocals (which is easier to find than a good male voice) with typical death vocals (done by Olivier, Bass Guitar).

Their first gig with this line up was great, they played with Syderia (NuMetal), Ovity (Hardcore) and Laid Down (NuMetal).

At the beginning of the year 2006, Aurelien, lead guitar and founding member, was remplaced by Yannis. Since then, boosted by this new line up, the band played with bands such as Necron (death metal) or Sinn(thrash)

The band can share concerts with Death, Prog or any style of metal bands without any problems. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Crystal+Wall">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
