Highway Chile, one of the first Dutch heavyrock bands (in the seventies/eighties) is on stage again. 

History 

Highway Chile originally operated between 1980 and 1985. They released several popular albums such as Storybook Heroes (1983) and Fever (1984). In those years they toured intensively and shared the stage with big international acts like Motörhead, Whitesnake, Michael Schenker, Accept and Y&T. One of Highway Chile’s closest fans was famous DJ Alfred Lagarde (†), who eventually also produced the Storybook Heroes album. With Picture, Helloïse, Bodine, Vengeance and Vandenberg, Highway Chile were at the top of the Dutch heavy rock scene in the eighties. 
In 1984 the original Highway Chile line-up fell apart. Some members continued on as Highway Chile, while Ernst van Ee and Ben Blaauw formed Helloïse. Highway Chile held on for one more year with some new members. Helloïse became even more famous but finally also split in 1989.
