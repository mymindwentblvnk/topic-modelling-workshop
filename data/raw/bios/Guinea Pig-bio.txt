There are least three Artists with the name Guinea Pig:

1. Sludge/Doom Metal from Greece
2. Gorenoise band from the US
3. Post-punk band from Jesi, Italy

1. Guinea Pig started to take form during the spring of 2007 in Patras in the ashes of former band Obey. Yiannis and Seraphim (Bohemian Grove) started to jam with Nikos (Caterpillar, ex-lucky funeral) in drums some heavy doom/sludge music in the vein of Black Sabbath, Iron Monkey, Acid Bath, Eyehategod, Electric Wizard, Cathedral etc. Unfortunately, a couple of weeks later, Nikos had to move to Athens, however the band found the best possible replacement behind the drum kit in Andreas (Revolting Breed, Utmost Contempt, Caterpillar etc). Guinea Pig started rehearsing again and after a while Christos (Hedon Cries) came to fill in the place of the missing vocalist contributing perfectly to the suffocating putrefaction the band produced. The first show came in December and therefore during May of 2008 the band recorded and produced their first demo cd which released one month later. Until now, the band has participated in some shows in Greece and there are more to come. Guinea Pig is now in hibernation. Andreas has left the band in summer of 2009.
