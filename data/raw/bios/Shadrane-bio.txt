SHADRANE was founded by Vivien Lalu in the winter of 2001 after his former band MIND’S ORCHARD disbanded. At first the project was called KHARMA but it was quickly renamed due to numerous other bands using the same name. Ex-DREAMSCAPE’s singer and now solo artist Hubi Meisel kindly helped Vivien pick the name SHADRANE after the young keyboardist sent him a list of different names to choose from. Hubi also helped Vivien to prepare a couple of demos (“Neurastasia”) that he would send at labels, including drum tracks recorded by Anders Johansson (Hammerfall, ex-Yngwie Malmsteen) who wanted to help Vivien as well. A deal was struck with Lion Music and the rest is history. Joop Wolters a long timer figure in Vivien musical output since 2002 was the natural choice to provide the bulk of the guitar work, with his place in the project becoming more important as time went on becoming Shadrane’s co-producer and writing 3 songs for the debut album: TEMPORAL. The Bissonette brothers joined later on in 2006 after being contacted by Viv’ to complete the line-up along with numerous guest vocalists. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Shadrane">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
