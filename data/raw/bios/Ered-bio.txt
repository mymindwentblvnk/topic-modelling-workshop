Ered arise from the ashes of Metempsicosis on 1996, with Varnaeh, ( guitars),Draug (drums) and Inferi (guitars /vocals) On that year a demo was recorded in a home studio, -Northern Sky-, but never released. Alter that Inferi leaved the group due to musical differences. In 1997, the band compose new material with faster and aggressive sonorities.
On that time, the group joined a new guitarist, Shogoth that next to Varnaeh would contribute with his new technical and fast sound to a new dark level music. The result was born in 1998, -Soulhunter-.

Following years some promos were edited and became a lot of changes in the band, Draug leaved the band for a while, but Varnaeh (guitars) Shogoth (guitars), Lancestor (bass), Etreum (vocals), follow up with the job. Also they had different sessions drummers in the band.
Under this dark association -Realms of the scorn- was born in 2003 and Oniric records offered them a deal and released 300 copies. Dark and aggressive Black Death metal which gets very good critics inside the show.

In the beginning of 2004, Ered thought that they had enough Killer songs for a cruel album -Born in a Frozen Hell- Recorded and mastered in Axstudios - Born in a Frozen Hell- is blended old school sounds capes with warp-speed hellish sonorities mixed between strong and really aggressive drums and guitar riffs with an implacable voice which drags you into the abyss!!.

Now in 2005 will be the year that Ered begin to win success of their dark and hard job. A good Prof. of that is Ered taking part in Mandragora Festival -Night of desecration- playing with bands such as Foscor, Amnion, Proclamation and Necros Christos.
