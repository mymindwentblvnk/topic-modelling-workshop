Monet192 (1997; actually Karim Russo), is a Swiss rapper from St. Gallen. He became known in 2020 with the song H <3tel together with Dardan, who made the top 10 in all German-speaking countries.

Russo is a Swiss and Italian citizen, but he has his roots in Tunisia and Macedonia. He is a trained psychiatric nurse and socially committed, in particular he works for disadvantaged children. In line with this, 19 and 2 in his rapper name stand for the letters S and B, the initial letters of Sick Baby. Monet is derived from the painter Claude Monet .

In 2017, at the age of 19, he published his first song Tout le jour on the Internet and immediately achieved high numbers of hits, as did the Mi000000 with song number two Jage the following year. He quickly reached 7-digit views and 5-digit follower numbers. In April he made his first EP 192 with these two and four other titles in the Swiss charts. In 2019 he was particularly successful together with BadmÃ³mzjay and the song Papi on YouTube as well as on the streaming provider Spotify. In summer he was for the Openair Frauenfeld, the largest hip-hop festival in Europe. In November he was one of the five nominees for the MTV Europe Music Awards as the best Swiss act.

In early 2020, he won the award for best talent at the Swiss Music Awards. The big breakthrough beyond Switzerland came a few months later, the participation in the album Soko Disko by the German rapper Dardan. The joint song H <3tel climbed to number 2 in the German charts and also reached the top 10 in Switzerland and Austria.
