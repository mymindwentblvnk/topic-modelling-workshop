Cemetary 1213
The name, Cemetary 1213 , was in reference to the song 1213 - Trancegalactica that can be found on Last Confessions, and used to emphasise the fact that this was not the old Cemetary reunited, but something new and fresh. Staying with the label of Sundown, Century Media , the new album and debut of Cemetary 1213, The Beast Divine , was released in spring 2000. Apart from Silver on drums and Lodmalm on vocals and guitar, Cemetary 1213 consisted of Manne Engstr√∂m on vocals and guitar and Vesa K on bass. Once again, the band felt neglected by Century Media, and was very unhappy with the weak promotional efforts for the new album. Therefore, in autumn 2000, Cemetary 1213 decided to leave the label, and decline any new offer that was made from other labels. Lodmalm decided to concentrate on other projects for some time <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cemetary+1213">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
