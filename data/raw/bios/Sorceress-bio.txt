2. SORCERESS (formerly known as Funkommunity) is a 5-piece band from New Zealand. Their 2011 debut album Chequered Thoughts received worldwide acclaim and saw the band tour Europe and Japan the following year. Fast forward to 2014, and the band announced a new name: SORCERESS and a new studio album: DOSE. 

While previous works were influenced by J Dilla-inspired future soul and R&B, the new album sees their sound evolve, fusing elements of Deep Electronic Soul, Afrobeat, and Dance Music. DOSE retains their distinctive sonic texture, but also projects more movement while going deeper into the source of the music. Experienced in headphones or a club/festival context, Sorceress traverses the boundaries between audio intimacy and the bass driven rhythms of the dancefloor. 

The creative duo at the core of Sorceress is producer/band leader Isaac Aesili and vocalist Rachel Fraser. Isaac Aesili's production provides a diverse and sonically rich soundscape from which the charismatic vocals of Rachel Fraser weave through both light and dark lyrical themes. Crafted over the period of a year, the album includes collaboration with Sorceress' guitarist Daniel Ryland. Other musicians involved in the sessions include fellow Kiwis Julien Dyne, Marika Hodgson, Tom Broome, Jonathan Crayford, Steph Brown and Cam Allen. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sorceress">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
