Formed in early 2005, Breath of the Dying is a 6 piece melodic metal band from New Caney, Texas. With heavy influences from such bands as At the Gates, Kalmah, Darkest Hour, and Vehemence, Breath of the Dying set out to make a unique style of their own, taking both the heavy metal and melodic aspects of their influences, then blending them together. The product of this unholy marriage of brutal heavy metal and face-melting melody was born, the Laying of Hands E.P.

With the help of Donald Catchings at 3D Productions, Breath of the Dying set to work on, and completed, the Laying of Hands E.P. in October, 2005. Immediately after its debut, Laying of Hands received rave reviews, and established an extensive local and online listening audience that was left begging for more. Following the success of their initial 4 track release, Breath of the Dying has gone on to work on a full-length album, which they have yet to begin recording.

Originally, Breath of the Dying started out as: Aaron Dobbs - Vocals, Victor Martinez - Guitar, Marc Vaden - Guitar, Robbie Duggan - Guitar, Jon Blouin - Bass, and Nat Conner - Drums. Unfortunately, Robbie Duggan had to leave the band due to technical and personal difficulties. He was soon replaced by long-time personal friend of the band, Chris Miller, as the 3rd guitarist. With this lineup, Breath of the Dying has managed to secure a solid place in the newly emerging Houston metal scene.
