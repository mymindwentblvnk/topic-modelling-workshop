Low Cut Connie is an American rock and roll band based in Philadelphia, United States, which was formed in 2010.

Old-fashioned, piano-slapping rock & roll with a drunk-ass punk-rock spirit â€“ like Jerry Lee Lewis if he'd had his first religious experience at a Replacements show. You can practically smell the Yuengling coming off this skunky, slippery ode to lowbrow kicks from Philly to the South Side of Chicago. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Low+Cut+Connie">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
