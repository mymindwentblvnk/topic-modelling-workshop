Jack Ladder (b.1983) is the alias of Tim Rogers, a songwriter, musician and artist from Sydney, Australia. His music is characterised by his baritone voice and poignant observations on love and death. His songs often feature a black humour and deeply personal revelations.

He has released three albums "Not Worth Waiting For" (2006),  "Love is Gone" (2008) and "Hurtsville" (2011) . An alternative version of songs from Love Is Gone "Counterfeits" was self released in 2009. Love is Gone was short listed for the Australian Music Prize and won the Red Bull Music Award. It was also selected Album of the Year by Who Weekly magazine.

His live shows are a constant reinvention, involving improvisation and deconstruction of his own material. Early shows were strictly acoustic featuring cello and upright bass. This was followed by a long period of electric trio and full band shows. He is currently performing with vintage drum machines, delays and the guitar sonics of Kirin J Callinan (Mercy Arms). His live band, The Dreamlanders, regularly features Laurence Pike (PVT, Triosk) on drums. Though evolving and experimental his performances are always passionate.

Ladder has toured and opened for artists as diverse as John Cale, Wolfmother, Feist, Bill Callahan and Okkervill River for whom he contributed to The Stand Ins (2008). He features on the live Bill Callahan record "Rough Travel For A Rare Thing" (2010) playing bass guitar.
