CIM is Simon Walley from London. His Service Pack release on Delsin Records was a big success, had to be re-pressed several times, and was praised by Mixmaster Morris and Andrew Weatherall among others. The release also caught the attention of Clair (ex-Clear co-runner), resulting in several releases for her new deFocus label, which include last summer's Reference album.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/CiM">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
