2. Not only this Smooth Jazz band shares same band name, they have a song called "Millenium"(2006) that is exactly same title (intentionally misspelled) as the other Incognito's (Jazz Funk) song on their album "100° and Rising"(1995), plus the logo resembles in font. The title "Every Day"(2006) on the album Street Smarts exactly alike in titles (when read) with the other Incognito's famous tune "Everyday"(1995). They are often tagged totec radio. Also mis-tagged by fans as bluey where there's no link to Jean-Paul "Bluey" Maunick himself. r00ts & t4lk1n l0ud tags also used, that could mislead fans to the Bluey's famous tunes like "Roots" & "Talkin' Loud".
