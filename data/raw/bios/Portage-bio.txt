Portage started writing music together in Duluth, MN in early 2011. What was intended to be a somber, acoustic duo quickly changed into something much noisier and more rooted in R&B than they would've imagined. The band quickly found themselves sharing stages and living rooms with bands Trampled By Turtles, Peter Wolf Crier, and The Black Eyed Snakes. Portage now calls Minneapolis their home. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Portage">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
