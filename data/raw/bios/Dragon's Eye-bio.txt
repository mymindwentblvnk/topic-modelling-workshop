The history of Dragon's Eye starts in 1999, when two friends decided to form a band. The co-founders of the band were Michał Kozłowski and Konrad Krajewski. Soon after the founding the rest of the members joined the line-up (Miłosz Komorowski-voc, Piotr Fligiel-git, and Marcin Przybylski-dr) and the dragon was ready to use the "eye".

After one year Dragon's Eye recorded its first demo at DBX studio, Warsaw. From now on, Dragon's Eye started playing regular live shows. The period between 2000 and 2002 was marked with working on the new songs.

Hard work has proven succesful. In 2002 the band has signed its first label contract with the Apocalipse Records. The deal brought band's first MC titled "Screaming For Metal". With the new songs the band continued to play numerous concerts across Poland.

The year of 2003 was a breaking point for the band. A fantasy writer and cartoonist Piotr Zwierzchowski invited the band to record songs for his comic book titled "The Drop World pt.1 - Sommo" So far this is the latest work of the band. It gave them possibilities to play more and more live shows. In year 2004 there have been changes in the line-up. Michał Kozłowski(bass) and Miłosz Komorowski(voc) left the band. They were replaced by Tomasz "Faja" Faber(bass) and Sebastian Pańczyk(voc) Currently Dragon's Eye is finishing its latest work "The Drop World pt.2 - Hanari" which will be available in may 2005.

Dragon's Eye plays so-called Heavy Metal. However the upcoming material shows the sings of evolution in their music. It's heavier, with more trash metal influence. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dragon%27s+Eye">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
