Return is a norwegian rock band (from Stange, Hedmark) founded in 1980. They were among Norways best selling bands in the late 80s/early 90s, but decided to split up in 1993. The four original members came together in 2001 and released an "best of"-album and also played some concerts, before they released a brand new album in 2005.

Since their foundation, Return has been playing classic 80s rock with a great deal of power ballads.

Current line-up:
Knut Erik Østgård (guitar and lead vocals)
Steinar Hagen (guitar and backing vocals)
