Norwegian act formed by Peisy in 2004. Headin' up for some kick ass heavy groovin' metal. A full line-up was completed shortly after and a 3 track demo was recorded along with some cool live shows. Nevertheless, the original drummer and singer were replaced late 2005 and the band continued with founding members Peisy and bass player Ole Vistnes, introducing Tommy Jackson and Leo in the new crew! The debut album, Dead On Arrival, was recorded right after and the rest is future! To be continued...

Line-up:
Daniel Olaisen - Guitar (2004-) (Blood Red Throne, Scariot, Trioxin (Nor) / Cobolt 60, session for Satyricon)
Ole Vistnes - Bass (2004-) (Autumn Inspiration, Session for Green Carnation)
Tommy Jackson - Drums (2006-) (Green Carnation, Naervaer, SoXpan)
Leo Moracchiolli - Vocals (Lowdown)
