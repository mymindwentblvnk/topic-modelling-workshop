Chilled C'Quence is the ambient/downtempo project of Pedro Matias (aka dj Fluxo) and Fernando Rodrigues (PsyJar). Both are and always have been connected to different aspects of music and technology. Two years after they met, they started to produce trance & ambient music under the wing of Quest4Goa. Evolving voices & space melodies, texturized with crystal sounds, take the listener into an electronic journey. This project has been presented strongly in important events inside the portuguese trance movement, as well as in the unforgettable Boom Festival 2004, with a live presentation in the Ambient area. Chilled C'Quence grab the attention of the English label Amboworld having signed for this one their debut album "Magic Sense". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Chilled+C%27Quence">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
