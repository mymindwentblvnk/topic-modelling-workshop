WSSAMS was an instrumental blackgaze project started in 2004 by Nicolas Gleizes (DÃ©faillance, Ethere, Lex Talionis, Morior, Ulfang). Citing Forgotten Woods and Nuit Noire as inspirations, he described the expressivity of WSSAMS as "nostalgic, entrancing and remote". After releasing a total of four demo recordings and a split with Aurvandil, the project was put to rest, never to be resumed. 

In May 2015, Nicolas Gleizes was killed in a car accident.
