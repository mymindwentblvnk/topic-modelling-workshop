German Black Metal band Nazarene Decomposing was founded by 'Sanguinarius' (Guitars) and St. Napalm (Bass) in Passau, Bavaria in 2004.
They worked as a duo for almost two years before the inclusion of 'Goatlord' in May 2006 then  'Judas' and 'Ancient Blasphemic Tyrant' shortly after.
In a short time a number of new tracks were written of which five were selected as the first demo called “Nazarene Decomposing”. The recording-sessions took place in the bands rehearsal room in december 2006.
“Ancient Blasphemic Tyrant” had to leave the band because of musical and personal disagreements shortly after finishing the work on the demo in early 2007. In November 2007 Nazarene Decomposing released their second demop: "Ad Maiorem Sathanas Gloriam", which was only avaiable on tape-format.
In February 2008 Gaap (Ancient Blasphemic Tyrant) returned to the band. Because of personal disagreements 'Sanguinarius' had to leave the band in May 2008. followed in January 2009 by 'St. Napalm'.
In June 2009, "Nazarene Decomposing" entered Pestilence Records for their first album "Demonic Inquisition". The Album was recorded at the Temple Of Demonic Legion Studio.
