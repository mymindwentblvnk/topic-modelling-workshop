In their humble beginnings (late 07), Newcastle's Doddy and Nath discuss something so powerful, so awesome, that they had to get drunk to celebrate! Upon waking the next afternoon they both had forgotten what they discussed and decided to start a band instead. Bringing to you, the foundations of SAGACITY...
Shortly after, teaming up with another good mate and former ex-band member Monkey on bass. The search for a drummer pursued.

After a few killer riffs were written and early songs started taking shape, one more mate and former ex-band member Davey rocks up to bash some skins!!! SAGACITY is complete...

This quartet brings catchy "grab your mother by the balls" metal and fuses it with the best of Traditional Heavy Metal, Heavy Rock and even the occassional Black Metal riff whilst still maintaining and carving a style all their own. They even throw in some sleazy southern rock for old times' sake. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sagacity">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
