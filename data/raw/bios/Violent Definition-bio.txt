Thrash Metal band from Greece formed in 2008 in Athens, Attica. 

In mid 2008, Violent Definition were formed by Nick P. on guitars (ex-Vultur, ex-V8 Carburetor, ex-Crucifier) and Nick G. on drums (ex-Crucifier) and after a while they teamed up with George B."IronBeast" on vocs (Mentally Defiled, Antidrasi). 

Since then we've started to rehearse a couple of songs to play live and also for an upcoming demo. The line-up was completed in 2009, where Kostas P. (ex-Released Anger) has joined V.D. on bass. 
In 2010 was recorded and released our first demo that contained 2 tracks and became sold-out within a few days. Also our first (and last 'til recently) gig took place at Thessaloniki in the same year at the first Sparks On Fuel Festival with Dimitris C. (Released Anger) behind the drumkit. 

Later on, the band paused for various circumstances until the interest was lost. Although Nick P. and Ironbeast continued here and there to keep the band's spirit alive, having both only remained from the original line-up. 

In 2013 we began recording our first full length album, while unable to find any new members for rehearsals. 

Current news for 2017 is that the album is finished and it would be ready for release (2018 for sure) under the title "Life Sentence"! 

On top of that, we're locked and loaded with two new beasts, John "Maelstrom" on drums (Embrace Of Thorns, Mentally Defiled, Fadom etc) and Chris Zoukas on bass, while also rehearsing and writing new material.
