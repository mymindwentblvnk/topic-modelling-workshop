AraPacis was formed in early 2003 with the goal of recreating some of the original aspects of the 70s era's hard rock and progressive music and allying it with 21st century prog, metalcore, doom and gothic metal feels, to make an interesting hybrid. They have played shows in places such as the Hard Rock Cafe Montreal, Toronto MQMusicfest, Ottawa, etc., opening for Anvil, Raven, The Agonist, etc. 


Their debut album "So Many Leapers" came out in April 2006 on FX Metal Records and they signed with Femme Metal Records in Dec. 2008; the label released their second album "Consequences of Dreams" in October 2009. They have finished their third album "Netherworld" which shall be released on Ravenheart Music records in late 2011 or early 2012
