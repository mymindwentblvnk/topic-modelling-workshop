Lala Lala is the indie rock project of British-born singer-songwriter Lillie West (born in London) currently based in Chicago (having attended the School of the Art Institute of Chicago). Her debut album, Sleepyhead, was self-released in 2016 and was followed up by "The Lamb" in September 2018 on Sub Pop imprint Hardly Art. 

“The Lamb was written during a time of intense paranoia after a home invasion, deaths of loved ones and general violence around me and my friends,” says West. “I began to frequently and vividly imagine the end of the world, eventually becoming too frightened to leave my house. This led me to spend a lot of time examining my relationships and the choices I’d made, often wondering if they were correct and/or kind.” 

As a teenager, West moved with her family from London to Los Angeles and later to Chicago, where she enrolled at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Inspired by those cities’ DIY music communities, she started Lala Lala as an outlet where she could process her new experiences, which often involved toxic relationships and partying around the city with beloved friends. The turbulence in West’s life throughout that period resulted in an abrasive but tender debut album, Sleepyhead (self-released, 2016). West decided to quit drinking, and she began booking her own DIY tours across the country. Sobriety provided her with a newfound sense of self and clarity, and she began writing the songs for The Lamb while also starting the process of re-learning how to live her life. 

West released "I Want the Door to Open" in 2021.
