Shadow of Soul was born in the 1998 in Vibo Valentia by the fusion between two bands, Masterdoom and Unscriptural. After a year spent for live experiencies, the band went to the studios for its first demo self produced , entitled “Whisper” containing four songs. At the same time the live activity of the band goes on but the members don’t forget the producing side of the project: in the 1999 the band backs in studio again to record the second demo “Mystic”, a three tracks job. And by this last release the “Shadows” obtain a contract with an Italian label (Videoradio) and give life to the first full-length of the band “Whisper from a shadow” (2001). After the release and many live shows, the band undergoes various line-up change . In the autumn 2002 the guitar player Rocco Spinoso enters in the band followed by Carlo Capocasale at the bass, that with Francesco Valente(vocals) and Andrea Iorfino(drums) complete the calabrian combo. With this line-up the band comes on stage again with good performances near important bands (Vision Divine , Glacial Fear). At the end of the last summer they enter in the Soundfarm studios to record and self-produce the last product called “The Hidden Memories”, an EP with 5 tracks. It’s not easy to find a right kind of heavy metal to define the music played by Shadow of Soul: a kind of heavy metal tainted by all the sides of heavy metal itself (prog,power,death, thrash,black etc.)
