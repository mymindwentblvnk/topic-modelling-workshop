Dale Cooper Quartet & The Dictaphones are the quartet made of musicians covering a wide variety of musical styles (they are former members of Tank, Osaka, TF and ex-groove combo Loupous) creates a music that mixes electronic (samples, cuts, sound treatments) and acoustic (guitars, saxophone, trumpet). They play moody ballads that sound as if they come out from one of David Lynch's movies. Like in the Hollywood master of bizarre pieces, there is something like a dark and poisonous colour broken by red thunderlights and blue cigarette smoke. The music spawns some odd characters and landscapes while the listener makes out some more friendly faces that loom up out of this nowhere place: the voice of Zalie Bellaccico, Milanese streets sounds, a lazy flute, some distant breathing swim on the surface of this deep troubled waters. "Parole de Navarre" is an invitation for opening the red curtain of this Dark Jazz cabaret made of shimmering and whirling walls. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dale+Cooper+Quartet+&+The+Dictaphones">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
