Founding members Dylan Penney and Brett Horton were on a mission to start a metal project. Spending plenty of time jamming guitar together and writing songs, the guys soon realized they needed more members. Dylan decided to switch instruments to drums instead of guitar. Soon after, Dylan invited an old friend Lukas Labrie to play bass and help write music. The guys soon recruited vocalist, Eric Zuchowski and Guitarist, Zach Calabrese to form what is now known as The Last King.
