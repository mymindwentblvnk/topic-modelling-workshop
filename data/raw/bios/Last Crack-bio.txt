Last Crack formed in Madison, Wi in 1987, and from 1989 - 1992, the band was signed with Roadracer/Roadrunner records, and released two albums in over 23 countries.

Their first album, "Sinister Funkhouse #17", was produced locally at Randy Green Studios by Randy himself. Sinister garnered much fanfare and attention as the cover featured charismatic singer Buddo naked in an archer pose against a blood spattered and dripping wall.

The second album, "Burning Time", was produced by Dave Jerden (Alice in Chains, Jane's Addiction)and was highly respected in the industry. It is still a cult recording today.

Last Crack's classic merchandise can be found for sale on Ebay and at the band's website, www.lastcrack.com

Last Crack broke up 3 months after the release of Burning Time due to managerial and band conflict during such a stressful time period.

For a brief time in 1994, Last Crack brought in singer Shawn Anthony Brown and released an unknown, milestone album called "runheadstartscreaming". This little known gem featured the unknown singer and 11 totally awesome Last Crack songs that have been re-released and remastered on Rokker Records (www.rokkerrecords.com)

In 2002, the band reformed and played a reunion show that was recorded and released called, "Burning Funkhouse Live", also released on Rokker Records.

Currently, Last Crack is writing and recording in the studio for an upcoming album on new material. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Last+Crack">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
