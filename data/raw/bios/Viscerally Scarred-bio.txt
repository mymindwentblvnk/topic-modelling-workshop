BIO
Originating from the bay area in 2009, Viscerally Scarred is a six piece Death Metal band that has the vision to blend together the best elements of Death Metal and Death Core to make the perfect combination of the two. While other bands buckle down and copy recent trends in the music scene, Viscerally Scarred stays true to the music that it wants to make. Our goals are simple, we're entertainers, and it's our job to put on the best show and put out the best music possible. With their album Chaos Rains out for free, Viscerally Scarred is eager to get their music out into the world and tour.
