In an unusual move, the Seattle based Mt. St. Helens Vietnam Band gathered considerable attention before releasing a single song. Instead the band relied on word of mouth, their quirky sensibility and several original 'PSA-style' youtube videos which don't even feature their music. Anticipation proved to be a great ally to the band, and upon the release of several songs from their upcoming EP they succeeded in providing a legitimate basis for all the internet hype.

The band is composed of Benjamin Verdoes (Guitar, and vocals),  Marshall Verdoes (drums), Jared Price (bass), and Drew Fitchette (guitar). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mt.+St.+Helens+Vietnam+Band">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
