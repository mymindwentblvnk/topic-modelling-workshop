Aphotic Dawn are a mad Melbourne based Death Metal band taking influence from bands such as Morbid Angel, Hate Eternal, Decapitated, Death and Necrophagist. 
Starting out as the brainchild of lead guitarist James Lowe. To realise the full potential of the project James recruited the talents of Brendan Brown (Bass) and Daniel Presland (Drums) from Melbourne metal act Ne Obliviscaris plus Ben Boyle (Vocals) of Sclera.

After hitting the live scene, Aphotic Dawn are now in the process of writing material for a demo to be recorded and released sometime in the near future.
