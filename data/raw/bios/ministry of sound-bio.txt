This page also contains scrobbles for the British 1960s pop band, The Ministry of Sound, due to yet another tragic case of Last.fm auto-correction. 

Here is some biographical information for the British 1960s band. It may be re-posted on the correct artist page when possible.

A studio-only project operating out of Southern Music's Denmark Street HQ in London, United Kingdom, The Ministry of Sound was essentially a mid-1960s collaboration between former Ivy Leaguer John Carter and two musicians he had recruited, guitarist Micky Keen and bassist Robin Shaw. They issued a 1966 d√©but single ('White Collar Worker' b/w 'Back Seat Driver'). A second single remained unreleased.  Keen and Shaw then played on Carter's response to the Summer of Love, 'Let's Go To San Francisco', with Shaw also becoming part of the touring Flower Pot Men after the song had become a hit. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ministry+of+Sound">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
