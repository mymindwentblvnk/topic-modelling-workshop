RAINWILL band was founded in Voronezh in October 2000 by Sergey “Sclep” Grebenkov, Alexey Gunenko and Alexander Krylov, who were united by a common desire to play melodic-death metal.

In the period from 2001 to 2005 RAINWILL made things hum: actively participated in different festivals, where they performed together with ROSSOMAHAAR, KRUGER, NECROPSY, LITTLE DEAD BERTHA, SKYFALL, NON IMMEMOR MEI and other Russian metal groups. In addition, in January 2003 the band recorded the first demo “Will Of Rain”, which included nine compositions.

As for the most  significant events  for the period 2006-2008 it stands to mention concerts in Voronezh, opening for Poles BEHEMOTH (May 2007) and the Swedes (April 2008), as well as recording three-song “Promo” in 2008. In July 2009 Moscow label MSR Prod. released their debut album “Canvas”. In March 2010 together with Ukrainian group AMBIVALENCE the band went to a full-scale Silicone Magic Tour 2010, which covered 10 cities of Ukraine.

From 2011 to 2013 the band worked with new material named “Zeroed by  Progress”. In 2013 RAINWILL signed a contract with FONO Ltd. for release of new material. The Album was released in November 2013.
