The band was established by Fulmineos-Emy(drums and vocals), Bogdan(bass) and Petty (guitars and vocals)in 1995. 
After many changes of the line-up, this band releases in 1998 it's only material,"Promo 1998" a material into gothic/death/black metal very diverse, some say in the old vein of Katatonia. But due many parallel obligations of it's members the band is kinda put to ice, later will be re-founded by Adi(guitars) with a new line-up were it featured the old member Bogdan(bass), who returned after several years, Odhin(guitars) who will be in Fogland later on, Nyx (keyboards), and Fulmineos, this time as a session member at drums and vocals but in the end this new line-up didn't record anything and the band simply disappeared. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Lifewood">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
