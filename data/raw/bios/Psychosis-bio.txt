The Los Angeles Thrash scene was alive and well in the early ’90s thanks to Psychosis. When all others were drifting into that muck that was Grunge, Psychosis was giving L.A. a healthy dose of Thrash. Combining influences from the Bay Area scene and some slightly more progressive elements, they gained notoriety throughout the area and far beyond across the world by corresponding with the fans and the media that garnered them fantastic reviews.

With their 1992 release Lifeforce, Psychosis solidified their presence. The band met an early fate in 1993 when it disbanded. Founder Kragen Lum and vocalist/guitarist Vince Levalois carried on as Prototype in 1994.

in 2006, three of the four original members returned to deliver the goods once more. Jason Mirza of the Lifeforce lineup joined Lum (Prototype, Heathen) and Levalois (Prototype) to once again be able to blast out the Thrash experience that is Psychosis. The band has enlisted the solid talents of Jimmy Schultz (Cheva, New Eden, Project 1) on drums. Last but not least, Bruce Hall (Agent Steel, Ex-Grinchfist) has been recently added as vocalist and frontman, making PSYCHOSIS a five piece for the first time ever.

PSYCHOSIS is currently working on new music, with a three song demo to be released in the next couple of months. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Psychosis">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
