Our story begins in autumn 2006. Kristina Županic, Zlatko Kušter (ex-Tearless), Josip Cujzek (ex-Tearless) and Damir Druško where the seed that has later grow under the hand of evil. Inspired by the great bands as Tristania, Moonspell, The Sins Of Thy Beloved, Dimmu Borgir and Cradle of Filth, we are trying to put together elements of different styles, from death metal, black metal, gothic metal and doom.Our progress was slow, but that was the time of high hope... Soon after, Miran Špicko joins SOE at first as a guitar player, but when Davor Kušen (White Steel) joined SOE as lead guitarist, Miran takes place of a bands drummer. Only few months of practice, and everything was ready for our first gig... Since Zlatko was the author of music and text in his former band Tearless, that has ceased to exist, a few of his songs was the ground to start with SOE. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/seed+of+evil">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
