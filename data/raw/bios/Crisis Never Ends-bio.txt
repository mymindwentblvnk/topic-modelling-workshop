Crisis Never Ends - A band that after years still has the energy and passion on stage and has the same love for their songs that I do. For once this is no "love 'em or hate 'em"-situation, you simply have to follow the former. This band brings back the fun into a worn-out music genre. This band is real and makes empathy happen. Thanks for listening - Kill or Cure!
