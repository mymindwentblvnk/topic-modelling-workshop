Hailing from Nashville, Tennessee, the band started in February
‘04 as nothing more than a recording project by singer James
Schyler Malone (Father) and bass player/programmer Chase Reynolds (Chicken)
; two artists and musicians from a local high school, Nashville School of
the Arts. The idea was simple, make music without boundaries and
write catchy songs.

Butcherpriest did not become a full live band until their first show
in October of ’04. It was then that long time friend, Chris Sanderford 
(Trash),was enlisted to play guitar. The sound of the band came together
almost instantly, but they knew that music alone wasn’t enough to
shock an audience. This is when Whitney Warner (Vanity), a beautiful young
exhibitionist, was added to the line up to serve as an eye catching
showpiece and backup vocalist.

Before their first performance, the band covered themselves in mud and
pig’s blood to draw some extra attention from the crowd. The
audience response was amazing. From that point on, the shows
became an art form of sorts. The stage show would soon involve
pulling people on stage in rusty chains, mud wrestling, nailing
people into caskets, and weilding a running chainsaw just 
to name a few instances.

Butcherpriest currently has two independent albums out. New American 
Horror Sideshow and Funeral For An American Devil. And they are currently
working on a third album expected to be out in '07.
