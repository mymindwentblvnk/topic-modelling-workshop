ANTI-FASCIST DEATH-METAL band formed in Barcelona, Catalonia (Spain) in 2007 by Andy Krueger, Mr Ax and Christopher (former ASGAROTH members) plus part-time session drummer Tim Plaston, a member the band wish not talking about further. They all have their spleens in perfect working order, and just happen to live in the northern mountain side of the city of Barcelona. The band play a blend of 90's metal and non-brutal death metal and put their debut demo 'The ageless pantomime' together in 2 weeks time. The idea is to revive the vibe alive in decade nine again and try and take it wherever the band can.
