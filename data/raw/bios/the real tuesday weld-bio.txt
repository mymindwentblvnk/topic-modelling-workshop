The Real Tuesday Weld is a British band from London, fronted by lead singer and founder Stephen Coates. They are known for producing jazzy cabaret-style music with subtle electronica influences, a style dubbed "antique beat" by Coates.

The band is named after American film actress Tuesday Weld. Coates once had a dream involving Weld and 30s vocalist Al Bowlly. Coates and others often cite the dream as inspiration for the band and its particular style.
