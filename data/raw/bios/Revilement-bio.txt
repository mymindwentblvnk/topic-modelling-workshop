Revilement was founded in September of 2006 and started out as an old school death metal band. Over time, membership changes brought a change in musical style, and the band evolved a more brutal and technical style in the vein of bands such as Dying Fetus, Skinless, Suffocation and Devourment. In August of 2009, the band released its debut E.P., Human Vivisection, and played its first gig outside of Taiwan at Hong Kong's Tomahawk Metal Fest. Since then, Revilement has toured Japan, South Korea, and will soon head to Singapore, Thailand, and the Philippines to spread the sickness even further throughout Asia. Revilement is currently completing it's debut full length album, Pillars of Balance, which will be released on Coyote Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Revilement">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
