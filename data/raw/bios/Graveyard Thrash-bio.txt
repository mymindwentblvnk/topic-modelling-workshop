Graveyard Thrash is a Thrash Metal band Formed in 2012 in BogotÃ¡, Colombia ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡´ . Current members include: David Manrique (Vocals/Guitars), Sergio Baquero (Guitars), Andres Rodriguez (Bass) and Joan Castillo (Drums).
 In 2016 they released debut EP titled "First In Battle" with four previously unreleased songs.
Their musical influences focus on Thrash metal from the 80's, with bands like Megadeth, Slayer, Tankard and Destruction, from which they seek to rescue the most important elements to generate their own characteristic sound.


In 2018 and 2019, the pre-production and recording of their first full-length album entitled "War In The Gates Of Hell" begins with 12 previously unreleased songs, which address social and cultural issues within the framework of the Colombian context, without neglecting the critical and representative themes of Thrash Metal which define the philosophy of the band. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Graveyard+Thrash">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
