now calls himself "Rich Dissonance" - born Eric David Holloway, in Baltimore MD, raised on the Eastern Shore, and relocated eventually to the borough of NYC known as Brooklyn, this artist takes inspiration from his earliest musical loves that include mainstream acts such as Stone Temple Pilots, Smashing Pumpkins and Pearl Jam and attributes his development largely to artists/groups such as June of 44, Radiohead, Shipping News, and Jeff Buckley.  Unable yet to categorize his music, the artist would like refer to his own style of music as progressive, not mathy but based largely in the "feel" oriented approach he developed as a percussionist, one which portends the development of a pop paradigm that incorporates, alongside chordal resolution, the hook-ability inherent in additive time signatures. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Holloway">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
