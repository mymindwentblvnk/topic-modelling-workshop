He is a modern polymath, free of the fleeting trends and identity crises of countless dreamers flooding Los Angeles in search of redemption and reinvention. Dominique Purdy, who beneath his iconic wolf mask becomes The Koreatown Oddity, inhabits a liminal space between the primal and the present, alternating serene passages with feral beats.  His productions are chapters in an ongoing saga, a narrative of instinct and experience, and an homage to his roots and influences brewing under the smog canopy and concrete jungle of LAâ€™s Koreatown. From his days as a teenager on stage at The Laugh Factory to his impromptu performances at local fast-food joints and Greyhound stations, he is truly a product of his environment. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Koreatown+Oddity">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
