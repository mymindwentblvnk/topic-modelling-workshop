Work Drugs is a Philadelphia based recording project started by Thomas Crystal and Benjamin Louisiana on the banks of the Delaware River.

Self-described as a band that "makes music specifically for boating, sexting, dancing, yachting, and living" or "Philadelphia's premier Bat Mitzvah and Quinceanera party band", Work Drugs' name was given by their friend Eduardo S. as they were sailing the Baja of Mexico. Band members Tom and Ben bonded together in sailing school over music, which is when they started composing songs for their first album. Their music has been compared with that of Steely Dan by the Guardian website.

Their earliest efforts arrived sporadically in the form of singles ("Third Wave", "Dog Daze" and "Rad Racer"). 
On June 27, 2011 the duo released their first album Summer Blood, which consisted of their first few singles and three acoustic recordings. Later that year they released their sophomore album Aurora Lies. The album, released on November 7, 2011, was the band's first release to bring a collection of entirely previously unreleased tracks. On July 10, 2012, Work Drugs resurfaced with their third album, Absolute Bearing.

In August 2011, the song "Rad Racer" was featured in the Urban Outfitters commercial for "Favorite Fall Jeans of 2011". In his 2011 album, Still Sound, Xxyyxx included a remixed version of "Rad Racer".

Work Drugs have played live shows across North America in cities such as Boston, New York City, Chicago and San Francisco. In April 2011, the group supported Northern Ireland-based indie rock band Two Door Cinema Club and Chicago indie rock band Maps & Atlases on a tour of the West Coast of the United States.

In late 2011, Work Drugs supported Peter, Bjorn & John and Memoryhouse on their east coast tour through Philadelphia.

In February 2012, Work Drugs supported Umphrey's McGee on their east coast run through Boston, Philadelphia and Baltimore. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Work+Drugs">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
