Creation is Crucifixion is a spectacle to generate discourse on what has become known as progress. The debates around technology exist within the walls of academia and by representing these ideas to a new audience we desire to renew the debate before the rhetoric maneuvers itself to the center of thought. We have no answers... only questions. Automata is conceptually rooted in our questioning of what in/describes life. Any correspondence regarding content is applauded. We are as you... tools of our tools. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Creation+Is+Crucifixion">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
