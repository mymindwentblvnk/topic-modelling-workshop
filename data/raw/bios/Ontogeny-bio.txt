Ontogeny is San Francisco based,  progressive technical death metal, started in 2005 by Nate Vennarucci (Sol Asunder, Anomalous). After recording several low quality and unnappealing demos, Ontogeny found the likes of talented vocalist Mica Maniac to record the first full length album, "Pillars of Perversion". Elements of technicality and evil riffs are riddled throughout the songs creating music appealing to the likes of Cannibal corpse and Necrophagist fans.

Album was self-reeased in 2007 and consist of 9 tracks.

According to Wikipedia "ontogeny is defined as the history of structural change in a unity, which can be a cell, an organism, or a society of organisms, without the loss of the organization that allows that unity to exist"
