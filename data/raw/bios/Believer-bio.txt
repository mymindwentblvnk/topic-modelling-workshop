Believer is an influential metal band whose sound evolved from straight-ahead Slayer-esque thrash, to a more progressive thrash, and finally to a very avant-garde mixture of thrash-metal, death-metal, and classical/operatic influence. They released three albums from 1989 to 1993 before disbanding in 1994, then reforming later to release two new albums in 2009 and 2011.

In 2005, drummer Joey Daub and guitarist/vocalist Kurt Bachman began to write again. They eventually reformed Believer with new members Jeff King, Elton Nestler and Kevin Leaman. "Gabriel", was released March 17, 2009 on Howard Jones' (of Killswitch Engage) Cesspool Recordings imprint on Metal Blade Records. Their newest albums entitled "Transhuman" was released in 2011, featuring a less thrashy and more avant-garde style.

Joey Daub and Jeff King also play in progressive/gothic metal band Fountain Of Tears. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Believer">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
