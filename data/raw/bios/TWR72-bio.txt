TWR72 is an Amsterdam based techno duo sharing the same predilection of music since their early teens. Fifteen years later, they still share this bond and are seen as the most thriving duo in the scene. TWR72 pioneers their own forward-thinking approach towards electronic music: a fusing and pulsing rhythm with a cutting drive, binding it with a strong signature groove. 

In 2010, they celebrated their first successes in the scene with refreshing productions with which they have set a standard for many following young producers. With an even more progressed sound in 2013, they signed with Turbo Recordings to release several leading techno EP’s. Moreover, TWR72 released "Endless”: a locked groove masterpiece consisting of 72 killer loops. The cherry on the cake was their collaboration with LA's most wanted producer, Truncate.

Their journey continued in 2014 with remixes for some key artists. Above all, it’s the year of the genesis of Float Records. TWR72’s own imprint on which they can further develop their distinctive sound combining true perfection and simplicity.

Tracky, stripped-back and tough as hell, TWR72 delivers an ultra-lean cut of prime techno. Perfect for every dance floor. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/TWR72">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
