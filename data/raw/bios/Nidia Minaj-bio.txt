Nídia (formerly Nídia Minaj, after a musical idol of hers) is a Portuguese producer of Afro-Portuguese dance hybrids. She grew up in Lisbon but moved to Bordeaux when she was 14, and her music echoes this displacement. On her debut release, 2014's Estudio Da Mana on Brother Sister Records, was a track called "V.A.G.G.": V.A. for Vale De Amoreira, the ghetto where she grew up and where "kuduro ruled"; G.G. for ghetto gang, "because it's my ghetto and my gang. I was always told not to forget where I come from." In 2017 she released her debut album "Nídia é Má, Nídia é Fudida" on the Lisbon-based Prìncipe label. Numerous genre descriptors swirl around Prìncipe's strange and vivid records, "kuduro, batida, kizomba, funaná, tarrachinha," reads one label biography. Formulas are broken more often than they are upheld. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nidia+Minaj">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
