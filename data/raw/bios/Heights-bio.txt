Starting in late 2006, 3 friends started jaming and realised an immediate chemistry and musical cohesion, went on to form "heights". 2007 saw a progression in the band's vision and musical outlooks. With a view to create something honest and unique, with an emphasis on progression and themes rather than traditional songwriting formulas. In Summer 2008 Heights recorded what they felt represented some of their best material so far in form of a 14 track album entitled "salvation and trepidation". In Winter 2008 Heights recorded a 2 track EP.

The band's new album, "From Sea To Sky" is out in the form of CD, exclusively available at gigs. And will be available online from August 2010.
