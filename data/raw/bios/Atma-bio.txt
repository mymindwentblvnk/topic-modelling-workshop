3) Australian born musician, ATMA.
Conceived out of heartache, love, loss and the unwavering notion of silver linings, these songs narrate the unravelling of a hallowed union and the harrowing
Remedy in Motion is the first release.
Painstakingly born in a solemn Berlin summer ATMA is the solo project of Jane Arnison. A classically trained composer, musician and sound engineer, ATMA, brings her ethereal voice, suspended over gritty guitar riffs to deliver a new layer to the mosaic of her musical adeptness. Executed with graceful ease, ATMA draws lines through on and over the borders of indie, grunge and dream rock.
