Ordo Templi Aeternae Lucis is a french black metal band.

It was first in 1993 that Hunferd started recording music for his project, "Putrefication", which later changed name to "Hunferd" in 1995, and then finally to O.T.A.L. in 2002. 
Two demos were released during this time. Three split demos have been released under the name O.T.A.L.
In 1996 Hunferd was arrested for exhuming a corpse and using it for such acts as Necrophilia. When Hunferd was arrested all his band equipment and the second demo was confiscated by the police so was it never released. The song "Necrophilia 1996" is about what happened during that time. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ordo+Templi+Aeternae+Lucis">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
