I've been making music since I was 17 and DJ'ing even longer, since I was 15. DJ'ing is still my first love without a doubt, but producing allows me to take the sets to another level by playing out my own material. I absolutley love music through and through, its totally what I'm about and what I live for. If it doesn't make you dance or make you think, its not worth writing it. Music is the only art form that you can truly appreciate with your eyes closed. And that makes it truly special.
