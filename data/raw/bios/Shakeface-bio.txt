Formed in early 2009 from members of former prog metal act Biff Tannen Overdrive, Glen Burnie-based metal quartet Shakeface has set out to bring one thing back to Baltimore -- the show. Keeping in mind the energy and enthusiasm of the best 80's thrash acts, and adding in their favorite bits of death and doom metal, Shakeface strives to create a unique blend to keep even the most reserved headbanger engaged. Following the release of 2009's demo Iraqnaphobia, the band has entered the rehearsal studio to work out more hard-hitting material and prepare for a summer 2010 tour. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Shakeface">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
