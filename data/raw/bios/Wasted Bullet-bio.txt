WASTED BULLET is one of the most promising acts from The Netherlands. With their solid breakdowns and catchy choruses they will grab a hold of your mind and never let go. After their release of their first EP 'Changes', they put the gear another level higher which resulted in the single 'What's Best For Us' that was mixed and master by none other than Tom Denney (Diamond Studios / ex-A Day To Remember).

A new era has come, as their debut album 'Lights Below Sunrise' will be released in April 2011. This album contains 9 songs of relentless hardcore, but also includes a more melodic twist. This album was mixed and mastered by Jochem Jacobs (Split Second Sound Studio / Textures).
