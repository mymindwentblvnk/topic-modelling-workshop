The original monicker of the boys band Meeuw. After an unfortunate incident during a rehearsal for a comeback show the four members decided to change the band's name. During a rehearsal for a comeback show, lead singer Bouvier X bit his tongue, which made it impossible to for him to pronounce the letter R. So they felt compelled to re-write their hit single "Ra ra ra (wie ziet je graag?)" into "Gis gis gis (wie houdt van jou?)". Thus words like 'heart' were altered into 'blood pump' and 'ear' into 'fleshy bulge on ya head'. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Albatrozz">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
