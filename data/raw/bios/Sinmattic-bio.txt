SINMATTIC began in 2011, in the city of Sintra, PT, when Pedro Antunes and Mário Lopes had the idea to create a new Melodic Metal project . Its goal was to bring out something different and musically appealing at the same time, exploring various influences and mixing them to create music that, although different, would sound fresh and familiar. Some time later, Ivo Duraes, a creative guitar player already familiar with original composition, joined the project. Once some songs were composed by these three musicians, it was necessary to find the right vocals to interpret each of them with the different vibes required. After working with various vocalists, the band decided to invite Carina Leitão, a singer with experience in many different styles, from Fado to Musical Theater, who brought the interpretations that were needed for the project. With the members found and the songs composed, it was now time to enter the studio to record an EP that could bring the project to an audience. The band recorded 4 tracks in the Fingerprint Music Studio and the Attic Studio, finding then Pedro Cardoso who recorded the drums needed, and André Abrantes, who gave his own touch to the songs with the bass recordings. In the summer of 2012, the band's first EP saw the light of day.

It is with great pride that SINMATTIC have now over 12 songs composed (even though only 4 have been recorded so far) and others in the composing process. We are now counting on our fans' support, whose feedback has been so very positive since day one, to achieve the conditions and have the opportunity to take our project as far as possible, and releasing more of our work. We assure you we have so much more to give you, and we look forward to it! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sinmattic">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
