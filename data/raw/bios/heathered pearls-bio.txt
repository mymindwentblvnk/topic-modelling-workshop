Heathered Pearls is the alias of Polish-born Jakub Alexander, music curator of the IS050 Blog, and founder of Moodgadget Records. Jakub has been DJing over a decade sharing residencies early on with globally recognized DJs Matthew Dear and Ryan Elliott in Ann Arbor, MI then moved on to Brooklyn to play along side slow motion disco duo Worst Friends.

Jakub is known to share that crowd-pleasing hypnotic end of rhythmic day time disco, synth induced melodic electronic and swell filled post rock but always comes back to disco.

The Heathered Pearls project isn’t only a DJ alias; in 2011, Ghostly International’s Ghostly Music Service released Jakub’s debut LP Polite Isle, which included 3 EP’s done in 2011 along with a couple of singles combined into one release.

In recent years he’s played at the MoMA in Manhattan, held an exciting weekly at Brooklyn Bowl called “Soon To Be Innocent Fun” and has shared the bill with many musicians at The Glasslands and Cameo Gallery. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Heathered+Pearls">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
