News report from January 9th, 2013.
Acclaimed Swedish hard rock vocalist Mats Levén (CANDLEMASS, THERION, YNGWIE MALMSTEEN, TREAT, KRUX) has collaborated with Swedish musician/producer Jimmy Lagnefors on music for a fictional band called LUDOR that is featured in the Swedish movie "Mammas Pojkar" (international title: "Metal Brothers"), which was released in Sweden in December.

Levén, who has spent the past seven months fronting legendary Swedish doomsters CANDLEMASS following the departure of Robert Lowe, tells BLABBERMOUTH.NET about his involvement in the film: "Jimmy and I wrote 10 songs for the band LUDOR in the movie plus the usual score. 

"LUDOR is just a made-up band that the two brothers [in the movie] are fans of. You never see the actual members in the film except for some poster and album covers. I sing on all the songs and play guitar/bass together with Jimmy. Henka Johansson (ex-CLAWFINGER) plays drums. 

"The first two songs [from LUDOR] will be released on Spotify/iTunes in a week or two. The rest will be out soon (January/February), hopefully on CD as well as download."

Levén and Lagnefors, along with Chris "Seven" Antonopoulos (drums; OPIATE FOR THE MASSES, LEAVES' EYES, ATROCITY), Pontus Norgren (guitar; HAMMERFALL) and -Nalle Påhlsson (bass; TREAT, THERION), performed three LUDOR songs at the Swedish premiere of "Mammas Pojkar" and they may do additional shows in Sweden if there is a demand.
