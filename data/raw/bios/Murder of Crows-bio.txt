There is more than one artist using this name.

1) The Murder of Crows is an atmospheric alternative band from Duluth, MN. The duo consists of guitarist / vocalist Alan Sparhawk (Low, Retribution Gospel Choir, & The Black Eyed Snakes) and violinist/vocalist Gaelynn Lea (Snöbarn).

The Murder of Crows was formed when Sparhawk and Lea did a live soundtrack to a Lon Chaney film screening in October 2011. Although at first it seemed an unlikely pairing – with Alan’s long history in the indie rock world and Gaelynn’s classical/folk background – their divergent musical styles created a complementary sound which was really quite lovely. What’s more, it turns out they enjoyed playing together, so the Murder was born.

At its core, The Murder of Crows is built around slow, winding, hypnotic instrumentals that hopefully create a kind of mental journey. Sparhawk utilizes looping pedals and other musical gadgets to produce layered waves of sound. Their music has been described as meditative, haunting, intense, and beautifully sorrowful.

The band prefers to think of it as ideal bird-watching music.
