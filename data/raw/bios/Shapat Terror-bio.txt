Shapat Terror is a hungarian stoner rock band, formed on the ashes of two underground hardcore bands (My Wounds and Anger) located in North-East Hungary, in the famous historical town of Eger. The band members had to wait two years for the ideal singer after forming the band in 2002. Sohi, the singer of Polly is Dead (one of the most promising band in the Hungarian Stoner scene) joined in 2004.

Shapat Terror - despite their hardcore roots and the fact that they are from the “North side” of Hungary - plays stoner rock with some sludge and southern rock flavour in the path of Kyuss, Corrosion of Conformity or Crowbar. Their first promising studio demo and a few video clip is available on their official website.
