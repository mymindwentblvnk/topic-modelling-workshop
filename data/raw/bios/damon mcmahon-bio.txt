Damon McMahon was a member of Inouk, a New York-based band that made an EP and an album for Say Hey prior to breaking up. McMahon then gathered up some of the off-the-cuff recordings he had made by himself -- predominantly recorded with guitar and vocals -- and released them as  Mansions, which found a home on the Astralwerks label in 2006. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Damon+McMahon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
