Genre: Grotesque Hysterectomy plays brutal death metal exclusively!
Often referred to as "Norhern Audio Violence".

How it all began: Grotesque Hysterectomy (GH) started out in 2003 by the brothers Alexander and Christopher Konings - in Asker outside Oslo, Norway.
After a couple of "in & outs" of the band we settled down when throatTrasher Disfigured joined the band the shiny summerdays of 2005.

At present time we intend to use session-members for live performances. One day we might join forces with a dedicated destructive guitarist...

2005: GH recorded their first 7" Called "Piercing Through"
