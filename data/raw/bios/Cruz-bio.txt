Born and raised in Sao Paulo, Brazil - five friends have joined forces to form Cruz, a soulful rock band with a modern edge. Their first album was put together in a week at Daniel and Filipe’s studio in Brazil. The band completed their initial recordings, packed their bags and traveled all the way to Los Angeles.

Shortly after arriving, the members of Cruz impressed Jay Baumgardner with their talent, energy and sound. They were signed to his label and management company, Jolt Artists and have been recording their new album in the famed NRG Recording Studios in North Hollywood over the last year. Cruz is currently playing live at several venues around LA as they complete the album and are looking forward to traveling throughout the US for a 2011 summer/fall tour.
