Long before Hunee, aka, Hun Choi began recording, he was laying the groundwork for a life in music, honing his skills as a DJ and working behind the counter at a Berlin record store specializing in funk and soul. In the past few years, Choi has developed a reputation as an exceptionally talented DJ with uncommonly deep crates, open ears, and nimble fingers; he's the rare DJ not only willing to venture from disco to house to techno and back again, all in a single set, but with the skills to do so convincingly. Until now, Choi's productions have largely reflected his fondness for vintage house and techno, but his debut album goes much further. While it draws from dance music, it's not defined by its norms. It's not a flashily or self-consciously experimental record, but the vision it showcases is unique. In its own, understated way, it represents an attempt to make music that doesn't so much conform to formal templates as it does reinforce dance music's implicit promise of freedom. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hunee">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
