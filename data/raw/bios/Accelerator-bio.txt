Accelerator is an Athens-based band formed in 2007 by Nicholas Adams (guitars) and George Pagonakis (drums). Originally named 'Deceiver', the band began with covers but soon began recording their own material with vocalist Mike Livas and new bassist Dimitris Anagnostou.

After lineup changes (Livas and original bassist Spiros Stikas) led to a 2-year hiatus for the group, they returned with Adams on vocals, Taso Mantis as a second guitarist, and a sound more influenced by traditional oldschool heavy metal.

Their 9-song debut album was released on September 3, 2015.
