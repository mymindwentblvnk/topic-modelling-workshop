GYZE is a Japanese Melodic Death Metal band, with notable Neo-Classical influences, from Tokyo, Japan. They formed in April 2011 after a name-change from Suicide Heaven.

They have released two albums (Fascinating Violence (2013) and Black Bride (2015)) and one E.P (Without Hesitation, 2011). Some of their songs (and demos) can be found on their Official Myspace.

The band is comprised of three members: Ryogi (Guitar & Vocals), Shuji (Drums) and Alta (Bass). The old, former member Shogo (Bass), which was part of the band (and in Suicide Heaven), left the band in 2013 after the release of their first full-length album. The reason is unknown and no official statement from the band or any of its members have been made regarding his leave. Alta took his place soon after being featured during a live house in the same year.
For the albums Fascinating Violence and Black Bride they had a guest vocalist Claudio Ravinale (vocalist in the band Disarmonia Mundi) on most of the included songs. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gyze">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
