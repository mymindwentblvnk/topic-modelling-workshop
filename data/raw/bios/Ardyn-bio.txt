British twins Rob and Katy Pearson who go by the name ARDYN (formerly Kitten And Bear) have burst on the scene with a superb debut single titled ‘Universe.’

The brother-sister duo are setting up to release their debut EP via National Anthem (Chvrches, HAIM, Wet, etc). The EP is produced by Scottish music producer/go to guy Rodaidh McDonald (The xx, Adele, Vampire Weekend, etc).  If ‘Universe’ is any indication of what we are to expect from this band, we are on board.

‘Universe’ can be best describe as a psychedelic/folk track. Think Daughter (also produced by Rodaidh McDonald) meets Karen-O.  Though it is early in their music career, we think ARDYN will release quality tunes on their debut EP and beyond. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ardyn">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
