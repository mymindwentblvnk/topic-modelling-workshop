Samuel Kerridge has garnered a dedicated following for his expertly executed slow churning industrial techno, fusing Sunn O))) -like walls of drone with the chug of heavy machinery.

Following his 2013 debut LP A Fallen Empire (Downwards) and 2014 EP Deficit of Wonder (Blueprint), Kerridge released his sophomore LP Always Offended Never Ashamed as the launch of his Contort label in early 2015, an evolution from his infamous Berlin party series. The Fatal Light Attraction LP was released on Downwards in February 2016, with an A/V show which debuted at Berlin Atonal, and amplified the crushing power he exerts to new extremes. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kerridge">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
