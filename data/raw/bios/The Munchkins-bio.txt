"The Munchkins" can refer to two different groups:

1. The actors who portrayed the munchkins in the 1938 film The Wizard of Oz are credited as "The Munchkins" on soundtrack recordings.

2. The Muchkins are a freak-indie band from Central Scotland.  Their music is often fuzzy with occasional rainbow coloured pyschedelic explosions.  The band started life as a three piece by life-long friends (Jamie Ormiston (bass/voice), Gordon Barr (guitars/synths/voice), and Grunt Anderson (drums/wisdom). 

They recorded their first album Meanwhile, on the Other Side of the Universe... in 2006.  They asked local artist/eccentric musician Martyn Robertson (aka Clarty Git)to draw the artwork for the album.  One thing led to another and in early 2007 Martyn became a full time member of the band bringing guitars/radios/clothes pegs to the band.

The band have been known to site bands such as The Pixies, Sonic Youth and Queens of The Stone Age as major influences, but rarely at the same time.

The band gig extensively around Scotland and are in the process of writing material for an upcoming release. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Munchkins">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
