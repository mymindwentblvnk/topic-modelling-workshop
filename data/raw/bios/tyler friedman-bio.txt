Tyler Friedman (b. 1983) is a composer/sound artist currently living in London, UK. 

Primary interests: centre on a contemporary interpretation of classical music structure, the integration of digital production techniques therewith, and developing a consciousness of varying presentational modes within the context of the artwork itself. 

Additional thoughts, concepts and areas of focus include: immersivity; the, as he has found, rather problematic insertion of conceptuality into abstract, instrumental music; spatial distribution, understood as the fragmentation and dissolution of a singular sound source/point of focus, i.e. the stage, the performer, the instrument, the body of the sound; (extended) duration; the filling in/mapping/development of highly specific, previously empty emotional-musical terrains; timbre as architecture or defined space and structural development as the narratives taking place within.
