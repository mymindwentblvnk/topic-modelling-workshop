1) The Absence is an American Melodic Death Metal band from Tampa, Florida. Their style has been described as aggressive thrash metal with Scandinavian metal influences.  They are currently signed to Metal Blade Records. The band released an eponymous EP in 2004 and followed up with their debut album, From Your Grave, in 2005. The band's second album, Riders of the Plague, was released in 2007. The album was praised in a review for finding an "interesting balance" between the genres death metal and thrash metal.  In 2007, bassist Micheal Leon joined the band. Drummer Jeramie Kling left the band that same year and was temporarily replaced by another drummer from the Tampa death metal scene, Chris Pistillo. The band recruited Justin Reynolds as their new drummer in early 2008.

The Absence stated in late 2008 they would be entering the studio to record a new studio effort in March of '09. Due to time constraints and touring duties, the band said they would enter the studio on September 10th since the original date "wasn't the right time." However the band delayed studio entrance time once again and recently stated that they entered Mana recording studios on November 2, 2009 to record Enemy Unbound, their third studio album. Enemy Unbound was released in 2010. In 2013 guitarist Peter Joseph decided to leave the band, and ended up being replaced by Scar Symmetry guitarist Per Nilsson. They have recently self-released a new single "Oceans" and are in the process of recording / writing a new album.
