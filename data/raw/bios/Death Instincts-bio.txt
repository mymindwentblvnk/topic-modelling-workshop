Death Instincts was created in 2001 by two guitarists. Andrei and Victor(Azazel).
  Firstly they began to play cover versions of diffrent metal bands. Later Azazel
 wrote material for first mini album. Soon Andrei left the band and 
Azazel found session vocalist and record "Bread And Blood" 2003.
  Two last albums was recorded in the same cast. Azazel - guitars, bass, and
John Doe - vocals.
  This albums - "From Russia With Hate" 2005, "Madness 33" 2007.
  Later new musicians came to the band, and there was full cast. But after some repetition they understood that they can't  
play together. 
  Now the cast of Death Instincts is Victor Azazel - guitars, vocal and drum programming, and Ereth - bass.
  Now they planned to give concerts, and write new material. And they never will stop again cause they is Death Instincts!!!
