1) You take a gulp of a tune, swill it round, spit it in a bucket and then you get an idea of where they're coming from .. the heady flavours of Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, Oasis, Reef, The Doors are all there for your tasting pleasure but Syrus's songs sound fresh and original.  They've even got not one but TWO anthems in their setlist - I defy you to listen to "Gemini" and "All Guns Blazing" without imagining the band playing to 80,000 people!

2) Syrus real name Kebe Iwara is a Nigerian bred UK based recording artiste and producer who originally became known as a member of the Ibadan hip Hop group Phenomenon with Tha Weaver in 1997 achieving local recognition and popularity which were often rated alongside Trybesmen at the time.
