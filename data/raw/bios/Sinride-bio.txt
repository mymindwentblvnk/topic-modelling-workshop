Sinride stand for powerful, melodic Progressive Metal with English and German lyrics.

But 'progressive' does not mean music for the brain only. Melodic and "phat" parts take their turn and complement one another. With their haunting melodies and memorable tunes, all the songs are very catchy with high recognition value.

But not just on recordings the musicians show their capability. A reliable and experienced team of four musicians with years of stage presence (i.e. Eternal Reign, Reckless) offers its audience an impressive performance with powerful sound and virtuosic playing technique.

The band from Hamburg, Germany was founded in 2009 and focused until now - besides occasional public performances - on writing original songs and producing their debut album Evenfall. Now, with the album's release in March 2012, the right time has come to present Sinride's songs to an broad audience.

Sinride are Tim Sievertsen (vocals, guitar), Denis Scheither (keyboards, backing vocals), Nils Schmeink (drums) and Lars Hilliger (bass).
