Brutal Symphonic Death Metal

Blood Thirsty began as a musical outlet for friends Derek Corzine and James Rich. Several demo ideas were recorded in the years after as simply raw death metal with melodic touches. In early-mid 2000's, some of the demo ideas we re-recorded and released via MySpace, but the project was later put on indefinite hiatus due to Derek's other band and music involvement with no real plans to revive it.

Finally, in the summer of 2013, Derek's friends in Oklahoma-based death metal band, Broken Flesh, renewed a fire for more high-quality death metal. With Derek's love for all things symphonic and extremely brutal, Blood Thirsty's sound morphed into a grandiose, epic sound with layers of 8-string guitar, multiple symphonic tracks, and an onslaught of powerful gutteral and shrieking extreme metal vocals.

Blood Thirsty's debut album, Sanguine River Absolution, was officially released on July 8, 2014
