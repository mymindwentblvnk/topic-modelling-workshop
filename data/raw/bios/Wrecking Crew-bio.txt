There are several bands called Wrecking Crew:



1)Wrecking Crew is a Boston hardcore band that is often credited with putting Boston hardcore back on the map (alongside legends Slapshot). Comprised of Glenn Dudley, John Darga, Ralph DiNunzio, Keith Bennett, and Taras Hrabec they formed in 1986 and soldiered on with the original lineup until '91. At that point Glenn and John left, ushering in Elgin Nathan James (Righteous Jams) as the replacement vocalist. The band occurred in various forms with EJ on vocals until '94 when they called it quits for good. In 2004 they got back together for a brief period to re-record the song Why Must They for a new discography to be released on Bridge 9 records. This was to be done because that was their only "hit", and they did not own the rights to the song, as their only full length album, Balance Of Terror, was still owned by Roadrunner Records and they would not give up the rights.

2) Wrecking Crew is  a San Diego punk band which was formed in August of 2003 and since then has been asked to shared the stage with many notable acts such as Dead Kennedys, TSOL, The Adolescents, Throw Rag, Agent Orange among many others. In November of 2005 the band released their latest 6-song EP, "Static Dream" on Finger Records which was recorded and produced by Adolescent's drummer, Derek O'Brien. 

3) Wrecking Crew is a Japanese Thrash band from Tyoko.
