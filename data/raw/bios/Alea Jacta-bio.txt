Alea Jacta started as a band in 1994. 

Formed by Juan Antonio (bass), Juan Carlos (drums), Alejandro (lead guitar), Maxi (vocals) and David (rythm guitar), they have been influenced by many styles, though mainly thrash and 90's metal. Playing covers from Nirvana and Guns 'n' Roses to Sepultura in the beginning, a year later they start composing their own songs, therefore creating a fresher sonority. In 1997 Maxi is substituted by Alexis, who added a new dimension to the band's sound, such as melodic voices and revealing lyrics, hitting canarian stages in a completely renewed way and gaining the reputation of a solid rock band. The following years the "Aleas" record two demos, playing as many concerts as they can, to improve their sound and developing what later becomes the current sound of the band. In 2005, David and Alexis leave the quintet, with Javier and Haime Kun joining the project. Javier's growling ability and Haime's skills on the guitar make the band reaching their maximum to date. 2007 is the year of consecration, and you can listen to the new songs of a new Alea Jacta on this myspace, more brutal, more revolutionary.
