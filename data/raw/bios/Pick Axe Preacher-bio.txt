Pick Axe Preacher is an Aggressive, in your face Detroit Thrash Metal band, is the best and simplest way to describe this cult mocking heavy metal band! They away the fancy bells and whistles that clutter todayâ€™s music, and give you a full force elbow drop to the dome. With blistering guitar riffs, groovy-speed drum beats, shredding bass lines, and vocals that make you feel like you're in military school.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pick+Axe+Preacher">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
