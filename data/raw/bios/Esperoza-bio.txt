Imagine the fury, the fury of raging planet expressed in such dark art as metal. Specifically extreme metal. Now add to that layers of symphonic orchestra, with its reachness and deversity of sounds. Lastly atop of this combo rides a true valkyrie, with a voice that can take you to heavens, or to the depths of hell. If you could imagine all of this, then you'll get the basic vision of Esperoza. 

With limitless troubles in their wake, the band endured, and finally released their first EP 'Tempest'. Their current plans are to further research this new found ground and to deliver a full length album during spring of 2013. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Esperoza">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
