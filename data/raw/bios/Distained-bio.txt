Distained is a metal band from Finland, which was originally founded in 1999 by Joni Ali-Kippari, Anssi Kalliotyrni and Jukka Lehtojoki. The band has been through a lot from the early days to the point where it is today. The detailed story about Distained's phases is available on their website .

Distained's music is based on melodic and emotional songs which are however played with rough attitude and heavy sounds. Through recent changes in line-up the band is nowadays stronger and more impressive than before with its new members - Niklas Sluyter on vocals and Jani Holttinen on the guitar. Holttinen and Distained parted ways after a succesful year and he was replaced by Tatu Suomalainen.
After the summer Suomalainen was replaced with Tony Helaakoski (former Amession).

In January 2011 Distained released their first official music video for the 3rd song on their 'Between Nowhere and Goodbye' EP, You Bow to No One.
