Hailing from the small Washington town, Camas, Primordial Chaos is a black metal band with heavy influences from thrash and punk. Their content is inspired from many different things; the occult, H.P. Lovecraft, Norse mythology, magick, the cosmos, and paganism in general.
The band originally went by the name Bloated Troll and consisted of Garrett "Suxur Mash" Sampson on vocals, Daniel "Munhist" Glaven on guitar, and Eric "Apollyon" Ontogook on the drums. They became Primordial Chaos in June of 2006. 
As of September 2006, Suxur Mash was removed from the band and Munhist took over duties as vocalist. Primordial Chaos has been split up since 2007. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Primordial+Chaos">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
