Thegiornalisti were an Italian Indie Pop group, formed in 2009 in Rome, that consists of Tommaso Paradiso, Marco Antonio Musella e Marco Primavera. They owe their success to two of their albums, "Fuoricampo" (2014) and "Completamente Sold Out" (2016); this last one has been followed by a tour that has actually been sold out in almost every date. They are inspired by Antonello Venditti and other 80's Italian songwriters. After releasing their latest album, Love, thegiornalisti broke up in 2019. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Thegiornalisti">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
