Profane Spirits is a Melodic Black Metal band constituted in 2003, in Bogotá D.C. – Colombia (South America), by Alex León (Guitars), Cristhiam Montoya (Bass and Lead Vocals), Pedro Osorio (Drums), and Diego Lozano (Guitars), who is not in the band anymore. In August 2007, Leonardo Leottau entered the band to perform the guitar, as a new and full-time  member. 

The band has a musical tendency, focused on the Black Metal, with melodic influences, and evoking the music of the greatest international bands, such as Dissection, Abyssos, Dimmu Borgir, Agathodaimon, Kalmah, Dark Tranquility, Death, among others. On the other hand, the band takes as a great influence the Classical Baroque Music, which is a very important basis at the moment of inspiration. The compositions embrace the profoundness of the music to create an atmosphere of power, sadness, and obscurity, which are conjugated and reflected on the scenery. The lyrics summon the darkness, but furthermore make a call to the human beings to regard themselves as independent, free and autonomous entities, as ‘SPIRITUS PROFANUS’.
