Ayshay, meaning “whatever” in Arabic, is an acappella project by Fatima Al Qadiri. Inspired by acapella jams of Muslim clerics and their followers in the Arabian peninsula and Iran, Fatima has set out to record a sound that is quasi-Islamic, using certain phrases from the Koran but modifying the intent of their meaning.
