God Is an Astronaut are an Irish post-rock band from County Wicklow, formed in 2002 by Niels and Torsten Kinsella. Their style employs elements of electronic music, krautrock, and space rock, reminiscent of Tangerine Dream. The band currently consists of Niels and Torsten Kinsella and Lloyd Hanney. They have released 9 studio albums to date. 

The band was formed in 2002 by twin brothers Niels and Torsten Kinsella, who took the inspiration for its name from a quote in the movie Nightbreed. God Is an Astronaut's debut album The End of the Beginning was released in (2002) on the Revive Records label which is independently owned by the band. The album was intended to be a farewell to the industry. Two music videos for "The End of the Beginning" and "From Dust to the Beyond" produced by the band received airplay on MTV UK and on other MTV Europe networks.

GIAA consider each of their albums to be a sonic "photograph or snapshot of who we are in that moment of time". In mid 2006 a licensing deal with U.K. label Rocket Girl saw both an EP, called A Moment of Stillness, and their second album "All Is Violent, All Is Bright" being re-released. The single "Fragile" from the album received plays on MTV2 UK's 120-minute show and MTV's show The Comedown.

Their third album, Far from Refuge, was released in April 2007 on Revive Records and as a download via their website. Their fourth, self-titled album God Is an Astronaut was released 7 November 2008 on Revive Records. On 12 February 2010, a single was released on their website titled In The Distance Fading, the second song from their fifth album, called Age of the Fifth Sun, released on 17 May 2010. That year the band became a quartet with keyboardist/guitarist Jamie Dean joining the band.

God Is an Astronaut's sixth full-length album, Origins was released in 2013. They then went on tour performing in places such as China, Russia, Brazil and Europe.

In June 2015, the band's seventh full-length album, named Helios | Erebus, was released.

In 2018, the band released Epitaph, their eight studio album.

God Is an Astronaut performed at the Eurosonic Festival in 2012 when Ireland was the "Spotlight Country". The band's live performances often make use of projected, self-edited footage along with lighting arrangements to form what the band calls a "full audio visual show". Each song is accompanied by its own video.
