Founded in 2003 by bass player Hannes Schaufler and guitarist Bernhard Schubert, TRASHCANNED has undergone a spectacular evolution over the past few years. While original members Tim Sklenitzka and Christian Hamböck, vocals and synth respectively, still form a part of the band's line-up, drummer Gregor Ruelens (formerly with Resistate) and guitarist Christine Schmidt (formerly with Aimless), who joined the band in 2005 only, completed the line-up after the original members had decided to take the band into a new direction. With the new members on board, the sound evolved into a melodic death/modern thrash mix that almost instantaneously increased the band's following enormously.

After releasing two EPs to critical acclaim – "And Embers Will Rise" in 2005 and "The Age of Treason" in 2006 – the band not only played a large number of gigs in their home country, but also in the Czech Republic, Italy and Slovenia, where they impressed the audience at the renowned Metal Camp Festival. TRASHCANNED have also shared the stage with well-known international bands such as Die Apokalyptischen Reiter (GER), Sworn Enemy (US), Torture Squad (BRA) or One Man Army & the Undead Quartett (SWE). One of the highlights of the band's career so far turned out to be the "Metal for Fairness Underground" contest in March 2007, which not only won the band many new fans, but also a deal with the Vienna-based label Noisehead Records. TRASHCANNED's first full length album "Redemption" was released in September 2007 and earned first-class press statements. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Trashcanned">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
