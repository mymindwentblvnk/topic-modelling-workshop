Hailing from Escondido California, this is just pure power metal from the start. The guitarist (Tracy "Spacey T" Singleton) and bass player (Stanley E.) came from Sound Barrier, the vocalist (Tim Bouchee) did some vocals for Unleashed Power, and is currently in HavocHate. Their drummer (Joel Maitoza) came from a band called Elysian. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gangland">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
