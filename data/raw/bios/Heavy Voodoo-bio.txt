Rising from the depths of NE Portland comes the crushing sounds of Heavy Voodoo. What started as the brainchild of Kol Baritus (drums) and Eric Gormley (guitar) sometime in 2010, became more than just an idea with the addition of punk rock n' rollers Jake Payne (guitar) and Zac Pettini (vocals). With the partial line-up in place, the 4 of them set out to create their own brand of heavy, sleazy stoner rock, taking influences from all styles of punk, metal & rock n' roll that they love. Still missing a bass player, Jakeâ€™s long time friend and former band mate, Keith Brown, filled the position proving to be exactly what the band was looking for. All 5 members have past experience playing and touring in punk and metal bands such as El Dath, Druden and The Escaped, just to name a few. Heavy Voodoo have played many local Portland shows which were all well received, and have a quickly growing fan base. With the release of their 3 song "Messiah" demo and an upcoming split 7 inch with local doom rockers Dead by Dawn (on Captain Couch Records) Heavy Voodoo look forward to hitting the road and playing a town near you. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Heavy+Voodoo">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
