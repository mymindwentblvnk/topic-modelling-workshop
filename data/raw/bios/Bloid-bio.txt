Bloid is a metalband which started out in february 2006. With several experienced metalheads from other local metalbands, a new and loud band was born in Alkmaar, North of Holland. The first gig was the 23rd of September in a venue called ‘the Kompleks’. It was a talentshow with all kinds of bands. Bloid came in second place. Drummer Daan got an award for best musician of the weekend. Bloid made it to the local news paper with their stunning first live show!
 
Bloid means ‘happy’ in dutch dialect. Happy name, heavy music! What is interesting about Bloid is that it is not a typical metalband with an angry attitude. Enjoy to play music and having fun is much more important than creating an heavy image.

Bloid is Rijnes on bass and vocals, Jeroen on guitar and vocals and Daan on drums. Watching Bloid live is fresh and heavy at the same time. Enthousiasm, energy and power are just a few key words to describe the Bloid live sensation. Metal at its best!

Now 2008 Bloid has just released their second mini-cd ‘Chaos, dat had je vroeger niet’. An even faster, more brutal and heavier mini album than the previous stuff the band has done.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bloid">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
