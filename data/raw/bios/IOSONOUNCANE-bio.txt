His debut album La macarena su Roma was released on 10 October 2010 by the independent record label Trovarobato. The album is characterised by a mix of singer-songwriter music, psychedelic pop samples and acoustic guitar for the melodic part.
His second album, DIE, was released on 30 March 2015. It is a neo-psychedelic concept album about the thoughts of two lovers, a man and a woman: the man is in the middle of the sea and is afraid of dying, the woman watches from land the last gales offshore, fearing never to see the man again.
