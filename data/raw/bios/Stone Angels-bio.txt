A blackened sludge/doom/metal band from Christchurch, New Zealand, formed  2010. 

Stone Angels offer an unapologetically bleak take on doom and stoner sludge metal. Downtuned guitars, droning riffs, haunting atmospherics and an aggressive vocal attack. 

Stone Angels was born from tragedy.

From SixNoises Blogspot : - "At times, Within The Witch sounds like a maelstrom of dark purification, at others like the earth torn asunder... Dredging the depths of belligerent metal, combining that with some metaphysical unease and throwing in some tangential wickedness, Stone Angels have come up with an album that anyone, whatever their troubles, can find some twisted solace in." 

"A malevolent, techtonic 3 song EP." - JJ Koczan, The Obelisk, on Patterns In The Ashes

Stone Angels sound has been likened to, or influenced by Eyehategod, Indian, and old black and white horror films among other things.
