The music of Shawn Harris is fresh, with a unique blend of spiritual flavor. 
His voice carries you to an unknown atmosphere and the music, all written by 
Harris himself, paint brushes his vision with spirituality and utter 
forgiveness. Harris is a man that has been broken and put back together 
again through faith and perseverance. “Memories chain my soul,” Harris 
recites in “Memories,” as he discovers that through his past experiences, 
strength can be found. The driving acoustic guitar creates perfect timing 
with Harris’ voice, echoing a very eerie yet uplifting vibe that will make 
you question what you’re feeling. The music often mimics Harris’ voice, but 
suddenly will take on a new Middle Eastern tone. Songs such as “Fallen From 
Grace” and “Keeping Hope Alive” are short in theory but manage to get their 
message across in minutes. This is one of those CDs that will hit you after 
the second or third listen. Listeners will find this effort an intriguing 
and innovative discovery. Temptation is hard to pigeonhole into one 
particular category of music because it ventures through various styles 
based on Harris’ often falsetto voice and creativity of the music that’s 
behind it. - Joseph Vilane
