Concept Of Time are a melodic metal band based in Scotland who have been together since September 2006. They play a melodic form of metal with dark overtones, which takes influence from an unrestricted range of genres.

After the release of their first demo the band gained critical acclaim from all over the world with numerous reviews from Magazines and Webzines, positive feedback from the general public, radio play as well as supporting big acts such as Sabaton and Korpiklaanni.

In January 2008 Chris Gallagher (Drums) left the band to make way for Phillip Morrison and the band has capitalized on their previous success, playing Bloodstock Open Air 2008 and supporting more big name bands (Gama Bomb, Warbringer, Alestorm + more).

During the recordings of 'A New State Of Thought,' Alan Kennedy (Bass Guitar) decided to leave the band but fortunately Andy Marshall was found quickly to take his place and bring a new dimension to the bands already powerful music. Leading up to the release of 'A New State Of Thought' they played alongside Kamelot and Serenity to a sold out crowd at the Cathouse in Glasgow.

In September of 2009 Scott McLean (Keyboards) and Andy left the band. Andy was soon replaced by original bassist Alan. In November 2009 Andrew Thomson and Jaime Cross joined as guitarist and keyboardist respectively.

Concept Of Time are now ready to take their music and powerful performances to bigger audiences and continue to build on what they have already achieved. 2010 will see the release of a new EP showcasing the band's new direction. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Concept+Of+Time">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
