1) Lucaria is a progressive metal band from Finland, which was formed in 2002. The name ‘Lucaria’ is taken from the ancient Roman festival of the grove (Latin lucus). They recorded their self-titled debut demo in 2002 with following line-up:

Janne Hirvonen: vocals
Kimmo Kovanen: guitars
Teemu Tuovinen: keyboards and bass
Timo Karhunen: drums

After the first demo the band members were busy with their other projects and it took three year hiatus before the next Lucaria release, “Oculis Captus”, saw the daylight in 2005. The line-up was the same as on its predecessor, except this time Tuovinen concentrated only on keyboards and Kovanen took also the bass player’s duties.

In 2005 Hirvonen decided to concentrate on his other activities and so started the long period of silence in the history of the band. Lucaria wasn’t completely inactive during the following years, but they recorded instrumental versions of new songs. However, the other projects of the band members still took too much of their time and the reincarnation of Lucaria was still to come.

In 2009 the time seemed finally to be right for the third coming of Lucaria and so Kovanen, Tuovinen and Karhunen started to practice new material with session bass player Riku Partanen. In 2010 they also formed together an alternative rock band called Shallow Dimensions, which released three demo recordings between the years 2011-2012. After that Lucaria has released following recordings: “Buried in Solitude” (2012), "As the Silence Falls" (2013) and "Embodiment of Time" (2013).
