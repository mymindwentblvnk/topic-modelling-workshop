Spoonie Gee is an American rapper of the early days of hip hop. He recorded for Bobby Robinson's Enjoy Records and Peter Brown's Sounds Of New York, USA imprint. He sometimes performed and recorded as part of Spoonie Gee & Treacherous Three. There is some controversy over the spelling of his nickname. In "Spoonin' Rap" he is heard spelling his own name as S to the p-double o-n-y. In interviews he says his nickname is correctly spelled with a 'Y', but he later spelled it with an 'IE'. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Spoonie+Gee">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
