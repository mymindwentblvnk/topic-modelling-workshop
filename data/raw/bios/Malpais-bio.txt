This music group has six of the best musicians of Costa Rica. They play original music with Latin jazz rhythms, often celebrating everyday modern life as well as times past in Costa Rica.  Their lyrics are as likely to mention cell phones and the internet as watching the sparks of campfires on the beach or spending the night at Grandfathers house in candlelight.

Formed in 1999, the group took its name (English: badlands) from a beach at the end of the road (literally) in the Nicoya Peninsula.  At that time this area was quite remote...now more touristed, as is most of the country.

In Costa Rica the group Malpa√≠s is a source of national pride, and not only because they sing the praises of their native land.  They frequently play in support of local social and environmental causes--for example, a recent public service message against the practice of "finning" sharks. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Malpais">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
