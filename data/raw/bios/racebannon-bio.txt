Racebannon is a genre-defying avant-garde hardcore punk band from Indianapolis which formed in 1996. Begun as a screamo band on Witching Hour Records, the band has constantly evolved its sound over the last 15 years. Throughout it all though they have always played an aggressive, noisy and ambitious style of rock. The band has released material on dozens of record labels including Secretly Canadian, Southern Records and most recently Tizona Records.

From their website:
Midway between a deleted scene from River's Edge and the resurrection of Frankenstein to unleash havoc upon the villagers that put him under, the Racebannon sound is one of many disparate influences that blend seamlessly into one lethal cocktail of hatred and aggression, draped in a cerecloth of pure molten rock that is as unforgiving as it is pulse-quickening. Indie rock? No. Metal? No. Hardcore? No. Noise core? No. Racebannon? Yes. It really is that simple. Hesh enough for any mosh pit, yet cerebral enough for the art palate, Racebannon attack with the heave and punch the endtimes dictate while still keeping things fresh and original. Love or hate, there is no ignoring the 12 guage barrage of riffs, screams, and drums. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Racebannon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
