Peter Zummo (born 1948) is an American composer and musician. He plays the trombone, valve trombone, euphonium, synthesizer, other electronic instruments, and also sings. His music is associated with the postminimalist and Downtown aesthetics.

He holds a PhD in ethnomusicology, a B.A. degree (with honors) in music (1970) and an M.A. degree in music (1975), all from Wesleyan University. He has studied with Carmine Caruso, Roswell Rudd, Stuart Dempster, James Fulkerson, Dick Griffin, Makanda Ken McIntyre, and Sam Rivers.

In his playing, Zummo frequently uses the circular breathing technique, which allows him to extend drones for a long period of time. He is a core member of New York City's DownTown Ensemble and has performed and/or recorded with John Lurie's Lounge Lizards, Daniel Goode, Arthur Russell, and Guy Klucevsek. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Peter+Zummo">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
