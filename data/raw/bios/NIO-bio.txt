The name "Nio" can refer to several artists:

[1] nIo (new Idol order), a Japanese idol group and a subunit of the larger group Oyayubi Princess. The group is made up of three members, named simply "1", "2" and "3". They perform wearing wrestling masks and often attack cameramen and occasionally fans. nIo's sound is hard rock, often with vocal screaming.
