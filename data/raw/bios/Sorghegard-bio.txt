SORGHEGARD was spawned from the black abyss in the early 1999. The concept of the band was to play blasphemous music and sing the lyrics in the native tongue. The song “KVAR FINNS BLOTT SKUGGOR AV GODHETENS TJÄNARE” was recorded for the compilation CD “ WITCHCRAFT AND FOLKLORE”. The band also recorded an unofficial demo consisting of 2 studiorecorded songs and one rehearsal song. Due to various factors the band decided to split up at the end of 2000.

In the beginning of the year 2004 the band felt an urge to channel their hate again. The bands concept was now changed. The lyrics was now written in English, with themes like Satanism, war and blasphemy. The music became more influenced by the American, Canadian and South American scene. In April 2004 a second demo was recorded consisting of 4 anthems of war. The demo was sent to various labels around the world.

In Oct 2004 SORGHEGARD ended up signing a deal with a japanese label for the release of their debut CD titled “HOLOCAUST OF THE HOLY”. During 8 days in Nov 2004 the recording of “HOLOCAUST OF THE HOLY” took place in NECROMORBUS STUDIO. 11 blasphemous war anthems were recorded and two cover songs, BLASPHEMY – “BLASPHEMOUS ATTACK” and IMMORTAL – “UNSILENT STORMS IN THE NORTH ABYSS”. The cover songs were meant to be featured on the Vinyl version.

After the recording SORGHEGARD took contact with the record label but were unable to reach them. During a period of 6 months the band tried to contact the label so they could pay for the studiosession and release the album but all attempts were futile. SORGHEGARD took contact with a different label who had shown interest but due to the labels unprofessional attitude the band decided to pay for the studiosession themselves and search for a new serious label.

About the same time the singer and the guitarplayer joined ranks with Swedish black metal warriors SETHERIAL and after all trouble who cursed SORGHEGARD the band was once again put on hold.

After 5 years of complete silence SORGHEGARD is back to unleash the beast called “HOLOCAUST OF THE HOLY“. The band is currently in contact with a new label and the plan is to release to long awaited full-lenght album at the end of 2009.
