Hailing from  Asturias, Northern Spain, Angeldark formed in 2007 from the ashes of the power/gothic metal band The Stormrider. Angeldark's style has been defined as symphonic gothic metal: it's cutting-edge melodic, epic and dark metal that doesn't hesitate to use extreme metal or electronica elements. 

Their first album (Ang√©lique, 2008) is a conceptual opera which features the Bratislava Symphony Orchestra and was mastered by George Marino (the guy who mastered Iron Maiden's "Seventh Son of a Seventh Son", Metallica's "Master of Puppets" or Coldplay's "X&Y" to name a few) and UE Nastasi (Anthrax, Paradise Lost, Cryptopsy) at Sterling Sound, NY.
