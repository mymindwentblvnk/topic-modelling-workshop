Complied of five dudes who loved to write metal, drawing influences from the obvious genres of death metal and straight up, kick ass metal - Eddowes Stride was born.

In two years being a band, Eddowes Stride have played numerous shows across Southwestern Ontario with such bands as: Into Eternity, Profugus Mortis, Quo Vadis, Threat Signal, Fuck the Facts, Ligeia, Diecast, Endast, Savannah, Burn to Black, WOTA, Excruciating Thoughts, Heaven Ablaze and Baptized in Blood.

Throughout the two year career Eddowes Stride has gone through various line-up changes and a name change. Formerly known as Whitechapel. Eddowes Stride soon learned that they were competing with another band out of the states with the same name. Soon enough that band was signed and Eddowes had to change the name.

Sticking with the theme of Jack the Ripper - Eddowes decided after 6 months a name. Taking the only double murder of two hookers that Jack the Ripper slaughtered and composing them as one. The last names of these hookers were used. Eddowes and Stride.

Not only was this a kick ass name, it is original and different from all the rest. No "Death, Black, or use of The" used in this name kids! It is one of a kind, and should remain that way.

But a time has come to be on our way out. Eddowes Stride have parted ways. But who nows what the World has in store for us next. Be on the lookout for new projects from the dudes within the next year.........  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Eddowes+Stride">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
