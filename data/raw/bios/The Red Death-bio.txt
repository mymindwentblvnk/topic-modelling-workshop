1) The Red Death were active from 2002 - 2008 playing their final show on October 31st, 2008 in Bath, NY where the band started. 

In 2004 the band started touring, signed with Metal Blade Records, toured for about nine months in 2005, then proceeded to get uncool real quick and party instead.  All in all, after a number of lineup changes, two demos, an EP, and two full-lengths ("External Frames of Reference" - Metal Blade Records; "Godmakers" - Siege of Amida / Ferret Records) the band decided to call it a day.  

Drummer Graham Mitchell can be quoted as saying, "I have no idea where I am or how I got here" over and over throughout the existence of the band while vocalist Paul Hamblin reciprocated with an equally astounding comment of, "WHERE'S THE HOT DUDES AT??!!!!!"

Every now and then if you know where to listen and if you want to hear, you might catch the faint honking of Graham's goose impression on the wind.  Proof that magic still exists to those who know where to find it.
