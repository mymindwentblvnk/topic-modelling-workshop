1. Moreno (born Moreno Donadoni on November 27, 1989) is an Italian rapper. He rose to fame after winning the 12th series of the Italian talent show Amici di Maria De Filippi. His debut album, Stecca, was released in June 2013 and, as of July 2013, has spent eight weeks at number one on the Italian Albums Chart, being certified double platinum by the Federation of the Italian Music Industry for domestic sales exceeding 120,000 units.


2. Moreno Winterstein (born in 1963 in Alsace, France) stands out among Gypsy jazz guitarists for his unique style, influenced by his tutelage under the venerable jazz manouche great Paul "Tchan Tchou" Vidal. Hailing from the Alsace, Vidal and Moreno's playing is tied more closely to timeless Eastern European Gypsy music than to the urban Parisian swing of Django Reinhardt. Seeing Moreno play live is a humbling experience. With a cigarette hanging from his picking hand and his eyes never bothering to look at his Favino guitar, he uncoils Gypsy melodies with dashing style, fluidity, and an astonishing speed that leaves you breathless. Moreno also plays guitar heroics with tricks such as playing a melody on one string using the tuner to change notes. Moreno released his first album "Yoshka" in the nineties and later produced many othe gypsy jazz albums. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Moreno">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
