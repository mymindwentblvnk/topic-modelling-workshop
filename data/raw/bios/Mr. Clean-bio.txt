1) German melodic rock band.
The beginning of German band Mr. CLEAN goes back to the year 1994, when guitarist Thomas Kupke teamed up some session musicians to build a new rock project. The group started to write their own material, while played in small venues a mixed set of original compositions with cover songs.

By 1995, Mr. CLEAN managed to record themselves nine pieces from their own, and published the CD “Wash & Go” through the unknown small indie label Baze Records. The band’s style could be best described as melodic hard rock with a slightly progressive influences, and some AOR/rock thrown into the mix. In example, “Way Of Love” has a strong driven guitar riff and a keyboard atmosphere similar to early nineties SAGA. “Intoxication” is a midtempo rocker with clean guitars and a cool refrain, influenced by the Canadian sound.

“Not Now!” is an uptempo synth driven melodic rocker with hints of Scandi – AOR ala RETURN or SKAGARAK, surely one of the best tracks here. “Blue Dreams” returns to the proggy territory, “King For A Day” is a catchy typically German MR/AOR tune, and “Twisted” has an hard rock Americanized style. The synth / piano only ballad “Only Some Words” is truly good, in fact, the best track of the entire record.

“Wash & Go” is an unknown CD, rare as an ice cube in the Sahara. Includes good songs and melodies that would needed a little extra work, but this is compensated by the freshness of the band. The production is as good as it gets for an indie release. A nice collectible.

2) French deep house artist, associated with La Plage Records.

3) A short-lived collaboration between Frank Zappa, Paul Buff, and an anonymous singer. They released just one single, "Mr. Clean/Jessie Lee" in 1964.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mr.+Clean">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
