(1) Sweden's Mind's Eye are a progressive metal outfit renowned for their tight, adventurous musicianship and songwriting that resurrects the melodic flair of the 70's and 80's. Centered around the talents of drummer, keyboardist and principal composer Daniel Flores, the four-piece released their debut Into the Unknown in 1998 with Fredrik Grunberger on guitars. Releasing two more albums with Therion bassist Johan Niemann they consolidated their progressive hard rock sound on A Work of Art released in 2001. In 2006, the band reduced itself to a power trio with Andreas Novak on vocals, Flores and Niemann. Novak's crystalline, emphatic performance lended itself to the high-voltage and critically acclaimed release Walking on H20 released worldwide by Lion Music.  The band are set to release A Gentleman's Hurricane on September 14th 2007 on Lion Music, samples can be found on the band myspace profile www.myspace.com/eyeofthemind
