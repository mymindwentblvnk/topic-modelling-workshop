Formed as a two-man project in 1998 by Lillmåns (guitar / vocals) and Rosenberg (drums), a couple of songs were written and a highly dubious 4-track cassette recording was made. After this, the project went comatose for a few years.

During the years of "inactivity", Lillmåns, Rosenberg and Frilund played together in numeral projects of different nature, ranging from folk-inspired alternative rock to Gothenburg-style death metal to Dallas-metal™.

A couple of years later in 2005, Lillmåns, Rosenberg and Frilund (a very talented bass-player, forced to play guitar in this abomination of a band.) got together to play black metal the way they wanted it to sound.

The trio adopted the moniker Chthonian, and mixing a few of the -98 riffs with a bunch of new ones the band wrote three songs, rehearsed a couple of times and in early spring 2006 the self-titled demo was recorded.

The demo received very positive feedback and led to a deal with Woodcut Records.

In September 2006, the trio entered KRS music-studios to record their debut album. Of beatings and the silence in between.. The album was mixed and mastered in December 2006 and is soon ready for release.
