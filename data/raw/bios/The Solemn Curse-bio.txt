The Solemn Curse was founded by Anil Carrier in September 2011.

‘Gateways to Eternity’ showcases an underground, yet hybrid sound. Its polished production captures all of the clarity without ever negating the raw energy or the intensity of the EP. This duo stand tall: with all of the instrumental duties being handled by Anil Carrier and the lyrical conceptions by Shadie Carrier they spew forth a
dark, punishing and varied work.

Recorded by Anil Carrier at Darksound Studios, Wolverhampton, mixed and mastered by Ajeet Gill at Hellfire Studios, Birmingham and featuring guest appearances from : Aort (Code / Indesinence/ Binah), Ajeet Gill, Dave Connolly (Rex Shachath ) and Richard Williams (Tomorrow Come the Wolves).

The band collectively includes members of: Necrotize, Towers of Flesh, Binah, Theoktony, Throes, Labyrinth and Mindless Torture.
