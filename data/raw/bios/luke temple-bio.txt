Luke Temple is an American pop-folk singer-songwriter, born in Salem, Massachusetts. While living in New York, he released a four song self-titled EP, recorded entirely on a four-track recorder. With this, he was signed to Mill Pond Records in Seattle, Washington. His first full length, Hold A Match for a Gasoline World, released late in 2005, took "Make Right With You" and "In the End" from his EP, and expanded it to an 11 song album. Rolling Stone described the record as "a collection of songs that even the most jaded anti-folk hipster could catch himself humming on the street." He would go on to release Snow Beast in 2007.

In February 2009, Temple recorded and released the self-titled album, Here We Go Magic, on Western Vinyl. Temple quickly formed a band for the purpose of touring and Here We Go Magic continued to record together. Their follow-up, Pigeons, was released in 2010, as well as The January EP in 2011 and A Different Ship in 2012.

In July 2013, Temple debuted "Katie", a single off his new LP, Good Mood Fool, which was later released on October 15, 2013. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Luke+Temple">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
