VOODOO GODS were founded under the name SHRUNKEN HEAD.
In TAMPA, early 2001 by Alex von Poschinger, Tony Norman and Seth Van De Loo.

In early 2006 VOODOO GODS were joined by Jacek Hiro (who had played and still plays with such bands as: Dies Irae, Sceptic, Decapitated and Virgin Snatch) on guitars and Nergal (Behemoth) on vocals.

2007 the band was joined by bass guru Jean Baudin (who played with such bands as Nuclear Rabbits and Element of Surprise), Mike Browning (who played with the mighty Morbid Angel, Nocturnus, Acheron) on additional vocals & percussion and guitar legend David "Shred Demon" Shankle (who was 7 years with Manowar and recorded the mighty Triumph of Steel album with them and still rules the David Shankle Group) on lead guitar.

In 2014 George "Corpsegrinder" Fisher joined Voodoo Gods, replacing Nergal, who due to the very busy schedule of Behemoth could not record another album with them. Corpsegrinder recorded the new Voodoo Gods album: "Anticipation for Blood Leveled in Darkness" ; which is released in July this year (2014). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Voodoo+Gods">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
