Twenty-three years into their music careers, the three members of  Against Nature show no signs of slowing down. Once known as Hellhound Records and Rise Above Records recording artists Revelation in the 80s-90s, Against Nature has released ten full-length recordings in the past four years on their own  Bland Hand Records and has appeared on several compilations. 

In July 2004, returning after a 13 year absence, the Salvation's Answer-era re-formed as Against Nature and began writing and rehearsing new music. The fun quickly turned into a serious artistic commitment, and the band recorded two discs' worth of music, "Appease" and "Panoply," at one studio session in May 2005. On a creative drive that has not subsided to this day, the band recorded their next three discs in quick succession: "Safe Dissonance," "Ghosting," and "Leer," all released in 2006.

Against Nature has played the Templars of Doom II festival in Indianapolis, the Doom Shall Rise IV festival in Germany, the Stoner Hands of Doom VII festival in Mesa, AZ, the Doomed to Fall festival in San Antonio, TX in 2006, and the Doom or Be Doomed festival (hosted and organized by John Brenner and Josh Hart) in Baltimore, MD in 2007. 

And that is just what Against Nature plays: doom metal, in the tradition of such classic Maryland bands as The Obsessed, Spirit Caravan, Asylum, and Pentagram. Mix in a liberal helping of Black Sabbath, Trouble, 70s rock, and the progressive rock of Rush, and you'll have a good idea of Against Nature's musical vision.
