Scarve is a technical death/thrash metal band from France, in 1994, led by Belgian drum genius Dirk Verbeuren (Soilwork, Aborted, Yyrkoon, ex-Lyzanxia, Devin Townsend Project). Influenced by bands such as Meshuggah and Strapping Young Lad, they have even collaborated with Fredrik Thordendal (Meshuggah) on the song "Asphyxiate" from their 2003 album "Irradiant." 

In 2006, clean vocalist Guillaume Bideau left the band to focus solely on singing for Mnemic. For their 2007 album "The Undercurrent," the band recruited Lawrence Mackrory (Darkane) as a session vocalist. A few months later, vocalist Pierrick Valence also left Scarve to fully dedicate his energy to his other band Phazm (he also joined Agressor and Addicted). The band announced in May 2009 that Lawrence Mackroy would be the vocalist for their fifth album, which as of May 2009, is said to be underway in writing. Dirk Verbeuren has been busy touring with Soilwork, but Bob from Watcha) filled during their performances at Graspop and Hellfest festivals in June 2007.
