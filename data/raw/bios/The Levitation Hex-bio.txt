The Levitation Hex was born in March 2010 by Adam Agius (Vocals, Guitars, Programming) after the collapse of Alchemist. The initial intention of TLH was to create a heavy psychedelic prog sound similar to Alchemist but at the same time a completely new beast. Mark Palfreyman (Alarum) was the first to jump on board adding Bass and Vocal duties followed soon by Ben Hocking (Aeon of Horus) on Drums and Scott Young (ex-Alarum) on Guitars .

The Levitation Hex intend to create the heaviest prog metal possible and 2012 is the year they unleash their  live show. Album is out now and Live Shows will commence August 2012 with an Australian tour, a trip to Prog Power Europe in Baarlo Holland followed by an extensive European Tour in October 2012. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Levitation+Hex">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
