Horseburner is a four piece stoner metal/doom rock band from Parkersburg, West Virginia.  In 2008, after spending their formative years playing together in many different local bands, guitarists Jack Thomas and Zach Kaufman and drummer Adam Nohe decided to form a new project.  With the addition of bassist Rob Howard, the group forged its place in the West Virginia rock scene.  

Concentrating on making riff-centric heavy music, while keeping alive the rock 'n roll attitude of the classic bands of the 60's and 70's and the high energy of 80's and 90's punk and hardcore, Horseburner has made new fans in each town they've played.  They've shared the stage with such bands as ASG, Cough, Chum, Byzantine, Skeletonwitch, Weedeater, Corrosion of Conformity, and Prong. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Horseburner">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
