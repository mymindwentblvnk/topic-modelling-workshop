Crushing, brooding, dark, progressive doom from Maryland. 

At the Graves started in 2008 as a side project to guitarist/vocalist Ben Price's main band Revolta, in Arnold, MD. Handling all instruments and vocals, he recorded the I and II EPs. Then he recruited bassist Andy Schmidt and drummer Joe Jacklin (both from Revolta) to complete the lineup. After Revolta broke up in 2011, they made At the Graves their main band and recorded the Solar album late in the year. Andy left the band a few months after Solar came out (to some critical acclaim), and Billy Carnes from Xozo and Dry Clouds replaced him. They are touring and releasing the new Mercurial EP in January 2013.
