Out from deep within a damp cellar in an abandoned Midwestern farm house crawls RedHorse.  Formed in 2003 as Mantis—later changed due to legal issues—RedHorse is a gritty, grain alcohol fueled stoner metal outfit kicking ass in the Muncie-Indianapolis area.  RedHorse is to your ear like a Vodka shot to your gullet, a sonic force like a bonfire that won't die.  

In 2004 they self-released a full-length entitled Moonshine Tabernacle [as Mantis].  Currently they're finishing up a new record, and of course gigging like hell on ancient stone wheels.
