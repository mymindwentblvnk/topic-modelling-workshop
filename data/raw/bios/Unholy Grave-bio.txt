grindcore / mincecore band from Nagoya, Japan started in 1993. They play fast and hectic grindcore/mincecore, focusing on the use of social and political lyrical themes. They are also known for their prolific output, releasing many split 7"s. A common phrase that appears on much of their artwork is "Grindcore Against Terrorism".
