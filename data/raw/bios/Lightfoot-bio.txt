Lightfoot was born in 1987 in a small town within Arkansas. At the mere age of six months he was adopted and moved out to Boston, Massachusetts. He lived in the very diverse neighborhood of Jamaica Plains. There, he was exposed to an array of musical cultures. From old school feel good hip-hop, to bass thumping reggaeton, and to the soothing sounds of jazz.

Lightfoot began producing as a junior in high school after being exposed to the hip-hop sounds of Atmosphere, MF Doom and Black Moon. After completing high school he went to UMASS Amherst. At UMASS he realized how much he really wanted to pursue production. So he decided to leave UMASS and attend the Center for Digital Imaging Arts of Boston University to study audio production and technology.

 

Shortly after graduating from there Lightfoot was able to get an internship at The Bridge Sound And Stage Studio. Under the teachings of Janos Fulop, also known as The Arcitype, Lightfoot quickly began developing his own unique production style.

 Lightfoot’s debut production skills were heard on Dominik Omega’s One of The Greatest Doing It, which has already gotten rave reviews. 

 

This is just the beginning of Lightfoot’s career. He’s constantly learning new ways to better his production. Learning is a never-ending process for him. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lightfoot">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
