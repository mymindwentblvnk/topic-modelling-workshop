Serpent Throne is a Stoner doom band from PHILADELPHIA, Pennsylvania, United States. Counting 4 member: Demian Fenton (guitar), Don Argott (guitar), Sean-Paul Fenton (drum/cowbell), Colin Smith (bass)

Say there was a heavy rock festival in like '72 where Black Sabbath, Wishbone Ash, the Scorpions, Budgie, and like Cactus are supposed to play, but then, due to a series of plane crashes and natural disasters, only 1 surviving member from each band can make it. In order to calm down the crowd of heavy rockers, Iommi grabs a couple dudes from the other bands and puts together an emergency band. And then Uli Roth says, "We don't need a singer because he'll just get in the way of the riffs." That's what Serpent Throne is aiming for.
