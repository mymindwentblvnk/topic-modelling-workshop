Source of Deep Shadows is a doom metal band from Poland playing death/doom with elements of funeral doom. The lyrics are in both in Polish and in English. 

The band was found on July 2004 and in the same month they recorded 12 minutes mini-demo 'Ukryty'. This demo was released in 2006 by the Russian label Endless Desperation. It also became a split with Panamian funeral doom band Lake of Depression and two Russian doom bands: funeral metallers Quasar and their death/doom colleagues Crepuscularia. In 2005 they recorded five new for the demo 'Source of Doom' and in 2006 finished working on their new material which featured a cover version of 'Eternal' by Paradise Lost. The two demos finally saw the light of day in their debut album. In 2010 the band finished their second full-length record 'Fading Emptiness' which was released by Redrum666 in March 2011.
