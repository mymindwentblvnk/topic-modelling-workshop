Thy Majestie, formed in Palermo, Sicily, Italy, is a symphonic power metal band based on a project from Giuseppe Bond√¨ and Claudio Diprima from 1998.  Their first demo was titled "Sword, Shields and Crown".  It did not meet with much success, but after a year of work their second demo, "Perpetual Glory", finally began receiving attention.  They are then picked up by Scarlet Records, a big company from Milan: after a troubled period their debut, "The Lasting Power", breaks through with the Thy Majestie name.  It's a real success, though they are mostly appreciated outside of Italy.

They recorded a new demo, putting two new songs online to spread their new work.

In January 2002, Thomas Youngblood called on Thy Majestie for a support tour for the group Kamelot, but because of their new album, they were unable to accept the invitation.  "The Lasting Power" was released in 2000, "Hastings 1066" was released in 2002, followed by "Jeanne d'Arc" in 2005. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Thy+Majestie">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
