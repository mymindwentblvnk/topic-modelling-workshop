Dead to this World is a project started by Ex-Immortal bass player Iscariah. Formed in Bergen, Norway, in 2002 and is set out to be Iscariah's (Necrophagia, Immortal) solo project which sees the return to the ancient speed/thrash/black metal underground. The first demo was recorded on the 23rd of April 2005 in Voltage Studios Bradford, UK. A limited edition hand numbered promo package of 150 copies had been sent out to relevant and potential sources in the scene, but were not be available for sale to the public.
