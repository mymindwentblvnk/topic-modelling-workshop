Frosthammer started in spring of 2009 with the goal of recording innovative black metal with a
variety of influences, staying true to the black metal genre
while expanding on the ideas set by black metal’s founders.
The name Frosthammer was intended to be a tribute to our influences “Celtic Frost” and “Hell Hammer.”

The style we've adopted is heavily orchestrated, while trying to achieve an epic and heavy atmospheric sound.

Frosthammer's one and only goal is to destroy
modern metal (especially modern black metal) while banging our heads FOREVER.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/FrostHammer">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
