'Swimming Tapes' formed when four friends - Louis Price, Robbie Reid, Paddy Conn and Jason Hawthorne - settled in London from Northern Ireland and met drummer Andrew Evans.

Drawing on a range of musical influences, including The Beach Boys, Wild Nothing and Real Estate, the band self-released their debut single “Souvenirs” in March 2016.

EP 2, produced by Adam Jaffrey (Palace, Gengahr, Leif Erikson), pushed the band on a level, with “Queen’s Parade” and “Alison” adding a punchier element to their sound, winning the band a session at the legendary Maida Vale Studios for BBC Radio 1’s Huw Stephens.

2018 saw Swimming Tapes sign a deal with Sub Pop Publishing, win PRS Momentum Funding, tour the UK for the first time and was used writing and recording their debut album, Morningside. With Tom Schick - known for his work with the likes of Real Estate, Iron & Wine and Jeff Tweedy - behind the mixing desk and a UK tour in April, 2018 was a defining year for Swimming Tapes.

2019 kicked off with a tour of China + Japan including shows in Beijing, Shanghai and Tokyo. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Swimming+Tapes">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
