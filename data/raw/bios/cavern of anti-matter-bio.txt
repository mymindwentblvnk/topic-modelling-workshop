Cavern Of Anti-Matter is an instrumental electronic band based in Berlin, Germany and formed in the winter of 2012 to record the dystopian future music LP "Blood-Drums" for the Berlin based Grautag label. Tim Gane was guitarist and Joe Dilworth the original drummer in the group Stereolab. They are augmented by Holger Zapf who plays synthesizer.

The band is essentially a power trio, but without any discernible dynamics and the music is mainly electronic and heavily treated. Some idea of the sound may be gleaned from the bands influences which include David Bowie‘s "Chant Of The Ever Circling Skeletal Family“, Mahogany Brain‘s "Bloody Hide And Seek In The Rain“ and "Hot Milk Elbow“ and the front cover to Heldon 6. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cavern+of+Anti-Matter">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
