april 1999,at 1: 27 am in Nis,by Nelle & Gary Bramil. The reason: Reaction to the mental torture,depression,shit among ''the heavenly people''.We had to express that negative impulse which COBI created. Why Death Metal? There is no other kind of music which can channelise[express]all that anger,bitternes,hatred...! How Did It Start? When the idea 'fell out of the sky',the lyrics were created[written]in a couple of hours [the inspiration was 'rts'channel].and then you take the instruments and you kick their ass as soon as you can! The first album 'SOON' went well for the people who got the point,but after changes-there were no changes!and,there was our inspiration to take the instruments again and againkick their ass!!! to break them to pieces again and again... new album 'demoncracy' is easy for listening...points to the authorities the mental stability and capability of people in the whole fuckin' world!!!
