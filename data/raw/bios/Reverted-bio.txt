UK Metal from the heart of Camden Town, London

Tony | Ozzy | Lui | Daniel - @RevertedBand

With their two singles Tolerance and Die my Saint followed by a worldwide release of debut album Sputter the Worms, the band reached number 1 on Reverbnation UK Metal Charts and their sound has been described as “In your face Metal with the ferocity of Metallica combined with the melody yet crushing rock of Alice in Chains and Soundgarden"
The chemistry between the members is obvious from the start and the roaring rage of hard rock never lets go or disappoint.

“Boasting a style that is assuredly heavy, it is clear that Reverted are well seasoned in what they do“ (relivethemusic.net)

“A plethora of explosive guitar riffs backed up by whippin´drums and topped with a vocal even Metallica would have been happy with.. A band well worth your ears” (Mhussey)
“This is certainly a band that shows promise” (thisisnotascene.com)
