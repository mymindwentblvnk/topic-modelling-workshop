That one followed the cooperation of Timofey Mineyev and Dmitry "Diamond" Sosnov. Originally, Timo and Diamond met in 2007 at the live performance of their then metal bands. However being an acquaintance, that event provoked the long-term and effective cooperation of two musical minds oriented on art rock, progressive metal, power metal, ambient etc. music. The project is the great combination of various elements and styles. Evolving structure and mood are the peculiarities marking out "Rose in Chaos" among other progressive, art-metal-, multistyle bands and projects.
The name of the project comes from the Stephen King's epic novel "The Dark Tower", the center of the music is a gentle and melodic core, surrounded by furious chaos of metal. The music is deliberately overloaded with elements and features to turn the traditional sound content into motley scenic canvases rich in colors and moods.

Features Dmitry Sosnov as the lyrics writer and lead singer (supported by whomever he invites) and Timofey Mineyev as the composer, arranger, instrument programmer and guitar player.

The first album, a metal song opera "Arbitrium" featuring a pleiad of Ural metal singers as well as the brilliant story, was recorded in summer of 2008. New album is under way. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rose+In+Chaos">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
