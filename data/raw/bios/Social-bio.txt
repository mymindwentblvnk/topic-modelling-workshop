SOCIAL is a 5 piece indie/pop band of musicians and friends living in ATL. They began SOCIAL in January 2015 with the goal of sharing their favorites of the music they have created ever since they started writing. Because the album was written over many years and with all the members of the band, the songs touch on many different subjects such as love, trials, freedom, and life. So you're bound to find a song that is the perfect soundtrack for right now, or brings back a memory.

Vocals/guitar - Jordan Mitchell | Keys - Luke Amerson | Guitar - Connor Rosemond | Bass - Trygve Myers | Drums - Ryan Harvey
