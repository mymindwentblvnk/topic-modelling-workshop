Semefo was born 1990 as created by Charly Lopez as an Avant-garde formation to support performances and museum installations by a collective of the same name. 
Semefo's first album was recorded in Italy at "Day Records Studio" with collaboration, participation, production and inspiration by Italian master Paul Chain.
Each song was originally composed for a specific event that featured the work of performers, concept designers, construction staff, wardrobe staff, graphic artists, photographers, producers and the audience itself.

Semefo's music is always in a state of evolution so it's better not to pin-point any genre as dominant. Semefo wishes to evolve into the entire spectrum of possibilities without sacrificing artistic integrity. Semefo acknowledge the art and magic of Paul Chain as essential in finding their sound and collective soul. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Semefo">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
