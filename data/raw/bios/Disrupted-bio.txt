Disrupted is a Swedish death metal band from Ludvika . They intended to focus on blasphemous, rotten old school death metal. And so their debute EP 'Heavy Death' saw the light in 2014 then their debut full length album "Morbid Death" in 2015. A definite must-have for fans that like their death metal the rotten old school way!
