A noisy experimental band with "improv tendencies," AIDS Wolf are good friends with the Unicorns, Wolf Parade, and others in the Montreal indie scene, but their chaotic sound has much more to do with Whitehouse and An Albatross, two bands they've shared the stage with. Three years after their formation in 2003 and touring across Canada, AIDS Wolf kicked off their first European tour in early 2006 as their debut, The Lovvers LP, was being released by the Lovepump United label. By the end of the year, Clash of the Life-Force Warriors was unleashed. Members Chloe Lum and Yannick Desranleau also run the printing/design studio Serigraphie Populaire (aka Seripop), which has been designing gig posters for Montreal's indie scene since 2001.
