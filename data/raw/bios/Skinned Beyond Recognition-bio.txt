Skinned Beyond Recognition was formed in january 2007 and released an EP entitled 'Barely Dead' in november 2007. Unfortunately the band lost their bassplayer in january 2008 and the three remaining members decided to call it quits in april 2008. 

Now the band is back together again and has begun writing material for a full-length album, due for release sometime in 2010!

Our influences are: Dying Fetus, Skinless, Broken Hope, Immolation and early Cannibal Corpse. 

Enjoy the music!
