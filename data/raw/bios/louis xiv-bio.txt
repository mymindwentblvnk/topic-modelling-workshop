Louis XIV was a quartet indie rock group from San Diego, California, formed in April 2003. They were formed from the band Convoy. Their first album, Louis XIV, was released in November 2003, followed two years later by the release of their EP Illegal Tender in January of 2005. Later that year they released their second album The Best Little Secrets Are Kept which entered into the US Billboard 200 and peaked at #159.

From this second album they released two singles, The Best Little Secrets Are Kept  which entered the US Singles chart, and God Killed The Queen which entered the UK Singles chart. In September of 2007 the band released a second EP entitled The Distances From Everyone To You and in January of 2008 released their third album Slick Dogs And Ponies from which they have released the single Air Traffic Control which entered into the US Singles chart.

The band's lyrics have resulted in them causing much controversy and subsequently they have been banned from playing live gigs in the state of Alabama. Their lyrics are filled with double meanings and sexual connotations, and are often condescending towards women.

The band split in 2010.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Louis+XIV">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
