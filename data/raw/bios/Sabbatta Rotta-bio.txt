MINCE GRINDCORE band. One of the first grind bands from Spain was SABBATTA ROTTA which recorded 2 demo tapes in 1992 and 1994. The quality sound is frankly lo-fi and bit mediocre, but we must to imagine how difficult was to run a grindcore band in 1990 in a small village in the Pyrenees mountains. Here we have added their 2 demos in only one link, but If you prefer there are the 2 demos separate in Lastfm. They sang in catalan, spanish and english and strictly musical they sounded like grindcore , noisecore and punk.
