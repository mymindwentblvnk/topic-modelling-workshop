Fred und Luna are two mannequins living in a fashion boutique in Karlsruhe/Germany, doing their self-described Elektrokraut music (Krautrock with electronic elements) and Krautelektro music (Elektro with krautish elements). Outside the boutique, especially on live shows, they are represented by Sugar Ray Buckmiller (aka Rainer Buchm√ºller) as Fred ... and an always changing Luna of his choice. Ray is also responsable for putting Fred und Luna's musical ideas on paper. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fred+Und+Luna">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
