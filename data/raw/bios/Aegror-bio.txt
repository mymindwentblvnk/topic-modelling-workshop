BIO
The band was founded in 2009 with the vision of creating a new style of dark and passionated metal with a unique sound. The result was the debut-record "De Morbis" which was released in 2010. Whereas "De Morbis" was influenced by different styles of black metal, the songs on their 2013 EP "Forgotten Tales..." were more open-minded then ever before and claimed to create something really new. After some line-up changes AEGROR restarted as a quintett and are now working on new music. Instead of walking the old paths the bands focus is on more experimential music with a lot of influences reaching from black metal to jazz and from tech death to post rock and even to genres like classical, pop or electronic music. The 2nd album will be an extreme and crushing avantgarde metal album which is not only outstanding but groundbreaking. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Aegror">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
