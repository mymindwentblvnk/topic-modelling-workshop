The first incarnation of this band consisted of Carlo Castellani's and Edoardo Natalini's fathers, who recorded the first demo "The Pestilence of 1348" in the early 90's. Their sons decided to keep the band alive and re-started Focus Indulgens in 2006. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Focus+Indulgens">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
