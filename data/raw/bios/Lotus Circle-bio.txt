Lotus Circle is a drone doom / black metal band from Greece. Their music has been described as an endless drowning into terrasonic noises from another time, sounds buried under feedback and inhuman screams. It's a dark attend to an amp surface, which drags you all the way down to darkness and depression. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lotus+Circle">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
