Shinichi Atobe is a mysterious Japanese producer. After quietly releasing Ship-Scope, the penultimate minimal/dub techno 12" on Chain Reaction, Atobe slipped back into obscurity, leading many to believe that he was in fact an alias of an anonymous producer affiliated with Chain Reaction or Basic Channel.

In 2014 UK duo Demdike Stare issued Butterfly Effect, Atobe's previously unreleased full-length, which was culled from archival material discovered by the two during a visit to Japan. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Shinichi+Atobe">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
