Sol Sistere is a post/atmospheric black metal act from Santiago, Chile formed in early 2013, but all members have gathered their experiences before joining their forces, in acts as Animus Mortis, Bauda and other underground names. So it is a new band, but an experienced force…

Their music is a blend of strength, melancholic melodies and emotions, which gathers influences from 90’s classic black metal bands and modern atmospheric innovators in order to create such an atmosphere that will embrace most of black metal enthusiasts. And it is recorded raw enough, but still full of a lot of details!

With their 2014 EP titled “I” on Chinese Pest Productions they made their entrance in the scene.

When Hammerheart Records heard the final recordings on the debut full length we could not resist working on “Unfading Incorporeal Vacuum”, because we consider it way too good to be left unnoticed. The combination of past elements such as Dissection, Vinterland and Dawn are completed by influences of today, think bands as Altar of Plagues Drudkh and Wodensthrone.

Sol Sistere creates their own path in a scene full of clones. The innovation in their sound is worthy of mentioning soon in the annals of Black Metal. They reach out to dimensions most bands can only dream about! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sol+Sistere">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
