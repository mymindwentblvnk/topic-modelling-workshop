Graupel is the name of more than one artist:
1) German black metal band
2) Japanese metalcore

1) Graupel are a German black metal band formed in 1995; lineup initially included three members of the superb Nagelfar, but currently only vocalist Zingultus of the original lineup and Gnarl (joined in 1997, also of Verdunkeln) are from the now defunct band.  Musically, they're along the lines of earlier Nagelfar with an added edge of obscurity and icy blasting.
