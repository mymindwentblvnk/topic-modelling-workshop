Nu-disco duo Tiger & Woods are the self-proclaimed sample freaks hailing from Rome. Once enshrouded in mystery, the producer-DJs have since lifted their veil of anonymity. But their true identities remain moot. The music, in all itâ€™s house and boogie-bound glory, continues to speak for itself.

Tiger & Woods, real names Larry Tiger and David Woods, first formed back in 2008 after meeting at Red Bull Music Academy in Barcelona. They bonded over an obsession for both rare groove digging and production machinery. Since then they have released multiple EPs and albums on the reputed Running Back Records and their own imprints, Editainment and most recently Tiger and Woods Records. Their DJing, like their production, is packed with carefully selected funk and disco tracks, ramped up with a modern house and techno flavour. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tiger+&+Woods">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
