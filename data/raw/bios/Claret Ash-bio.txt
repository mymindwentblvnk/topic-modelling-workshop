Black metal band from Canberra, Australia formed mid 2012. Ground Dweller CD released 1 June 2013 and live shows have started.


Biography
Claret Ash are a black metal band based in Canberra, Australia. By incorporating atmospheric and melodic elements, a uniquely dark sound is born. Each song is a personal tale, carefully crafted to take listeners on a journey through landscapes and caverns to confront the themes and imagery.

Claret Ash take their name from the Claret Ash tree (or Fraxinus Raywood), a deciduous tree that turns a dark red colour during autumn. This magnificent tree grows tall and strong but more recently a number of older Claret Ash trees are suffering from the presence of a fungus causing the trees to decline, branches and sometimes the whole tree will die.

Claret Ash began as a studio project and developed into a full band in mid 2012. By April 2013, Claret Ash had completed five songs for a self-funded concept EP. The songs are linked through a similar theme and series of stories which deliver the atmosphere and intensity Claret Ash aspire to create.

Live shows have been scheduled with the launch of the EP in Canberra, 1 June 2013. A great deal of time, planning and enthusiasm has gone into preparation for the live shows to ensure the themes and darkness invoked within each song is experienced by the audience. The aim of Claret Ash is to build a reputation for putting on extremely tight and memorable shows, ensuring the audience is involved and feel connected to the music.

While upholding current elements and continuing to push the boundaries of their own twisted style of music, Claret Ash produces an honest recording and performance that showcases the talents of each band member. Claret Ash intends to take their music even further with future releases by creating some of the 
darkest, intense and melodic music around.
