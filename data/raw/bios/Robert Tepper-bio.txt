Robert Tepper (born Antoine Roberto Teppardo) is a singer, best known for his hit Rocky IV soundtrack song, "No Easy Way Out".

Born in Bayonne, New Jersey, Tepper moved to New York where he became a staff writer until he paired up with fellow singer Benny Mardones. Together they wrote Mardones' pop hit "Into the Night" which earned the pair a Grammy Awards nomination.

In 1985, Tepper signed with Scotti Brothers and moved to Los Angeles. Actor/Director Sylvester Stallone was taken with Tepper's song "No Easy Way Out" which subsequently led to its inclusion into the movie Rocky IV.

"No Easy Way Out" skyrocketed to the Top 30 reaching 22 in 1986, momentarily putting Tepper in the public eye.
