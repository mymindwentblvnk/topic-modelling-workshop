Albatross was born in the year 1998 and has made a landmark in the current Nepali music scene. It all began when a couple of guys joined hands, came together with their rusted guitars and other old instruments to transcend the sound of Nepali Alternative music, each of which has significantly influenced the music which the band creates. They play Nepali Rock that addresses contemporary issues of Nepal. The band loves playing music that people can relate to, be it through music or the lyrics. They are a tight bunch of guys that love playing live, are true to our music and most importantly love what they do. With a number of songs that have echoed through time already and some songs that are heralded as life anthems - the band looks set for greater things. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Albatross">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
