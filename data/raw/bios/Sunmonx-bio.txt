Sunmonx is a Melbourne based collaborative project between producers OPIUO (Oscar) and ALBINO (Albino). Originally from New Zealand and Mexico respectively. They met early 2008, and instantly knew they had to combine their unique ideas, influences and rhythmic vibrations to create live electronica. Both are music lovers, and accomplished producers in their own right. With their more up-tempo creations being played and released throughout many corners of the globe. Addicted to all shapes and forms of melody, beats, and harmony, together Sunmonx take you on a live hybrid exploration into new realms of downbeat, dub, progressive beats, and all things electronica. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sunmonx">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
