Formed in 1996 in Lakewood, California by the Bowman brothers, Enthraller self-released their six song EP "Cause of Suffering" in 2004.

Due to the response, the band hit the studio shortly after to record their full length album "Slaves and Gods", which was released in October to rave reviews.

With a sound that fuses old school death metal with unrelenting groove and brutality, Enthraller laid down the tracks for global decimation. "Slaves and Gods" saw Enthraller drive the metal hammer further, making the band one of Los Angeles' premier Extreme metal acts. Destroying the stage with such metal gods as Obituary, Decide, Vital Remains, Hate Eternal, Origin, Malevolent Creation, Decrepit Birth, Pungent Stench, Impaled, Cattle Decapitation, and Psyopus.

Metal Maniacs Magazine picked Enthraller from hundreds of bands to be featured alongside the likes of Bloodbath and Satyricon, as well as featured thier hit song "Of the Sun" on their CD compilation in the December 2008 issue.

The band went into Shrine Recording Studios in the winter of 2009 and summer of 2010 to record their latest album; mastered by (Vile) Colin Davis of Imperial Mastering.

Early May 2010 marked the U.S. release of "The Devil King of the Sixth Heaven" followed by the European release in early 2011. The much anticipated third opus had been unleashed onto the masses like a brutal bullet train decimating all in it's path. The best is yet to come. Enthraller's latest guitarists Kyle Bell and Mike Naz are hard at work on the fourth coming album due to drop sometime in early 2012.

If you thought you've heard everything there is to hear from Enthraller, you haven't heard anything yet! Ready your ears and eyes. . . for they will bleed profusely.
