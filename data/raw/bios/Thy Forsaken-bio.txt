Thy Forsaken was formed back in 2004 and started as a coverband. In 2006 they started to make theire own songs.
Thy Forsaken played just a few gigs in 2005 & 2006, and strated to get more serious in 2007. The demo "House of pain" was released in march 2007 and got 5 out of 10 stars at the StreetsWebZine.com. The demo got them some more gigs and played at Skuret, Nystua, Elveblest, Connect and a personal gig at Minnesund.

In february 2008 Thy Forsaken and Patman(bass) decided to go their separate ways.

Thy Forsaken started to record the Ep "Seven" at the end of 2007 and released it in March 2008
