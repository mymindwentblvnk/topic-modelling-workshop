Misanthrophile is a two-member, progressive metal, studio band that focuses on producing music rather than live entertainment.  The band was started in 2013 by Andrew Thayer and Joshua Reynolds, although its roots stretch back to the early 1990s when the duo composed the material that 20 years later they would transform into the nine tracks on their 2015 debut album, Depths of Distrust.

Misanthrophile’s music is best described as ‘progressive metal’, ‘hard rock’ and ‘avant-garde metal’.  The guitars and rhythms are intense, dark and heavy as much as they are mellow and melodic.  Far from simply ‘laying down a beat’, the drums take on a more musical role as they drive sophisticated instrumentation and vocal harmonies through epic arrangements.  Extended, mind-blowing jams and insane time changes abound.  The vocals are mostly clean and the lyrics are both poetic and profound. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Misanthrophile">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
