Mutilated was a cult death metal band from France, alive in the early 90's, which released two critically acclaimed demo tapes. Mutilated remains one of the major french DM bands, along with Massacra or Loudblast. After the first split, they reformed with the same line-up under the name Abyssals and released another demo. The ex-members are now in Act Of Gods (fr) and The Seven Gates. Tracks called "Evil Scriptures" and "Tormented Creation" were recorded in 1993 for a 7" record, but this never materialized. A bootleg 12" vinyl limited to 500 copies was released in 2004 by Foreign Legion Records including Psychodeath Lunatics, Resurrected, and the unreleased 7".

In 2013, french underground label Triumph Ov Death started releasing the entire Mutilated discography on vinyl, including the never released 7" as part of a triple-vinyl compilation titled In Memoriam which consists of never-released before recordings. The demos saw a vinyl release as well.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mutilated">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
