Three musical worlds combined in a fascinating original instrumental music ensemble. Offir Benjaminov (Bass), Tamuz Dekel (Guitar) and Dan Mayo (Drums), in their early twenties, come from diverse backgrounds and form together a new musical entity. a rich and crystallized creation crossing through modern jazz, rock, classical, folk, avant-garde and electronica. Gripping melodic compositions with a unique approach to sound, mesmerizing grooves, virtuoso performance and complex meticulous arrangements alongside sections of boundless dynamic improvisation. all the while showcasing a deep telepathic communication on stage. Recently they finished the recording of their debut album, to be released soon.
