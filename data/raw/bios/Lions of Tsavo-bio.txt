The Lions of Tsavo as a working entity crawled out of Columbus, Ohio in the year 2003, created from the ashes of Ambassador 990, Montreal Curse, and the Trem .. who worked on their last album with Steve Austin of Today is the Day. Being pared down to a trio from their former projects, they were drawn towards an altogether heavier sound akin to being mowed over by a line of tanks. All it took was for Ryan Chamberlain to convince his former band mates Matt Walker and Josh Dawkins to make the trek down to Austin, TX in order to have a clean start and create some apocalyptic rock music that no one could classify.

The Lions of Tsavo set out to conquer not only on the strength of the material, but also by the sheer volume and density of sound, attracting interest from people such as recording engineer Billy Anderson (Neurosis, Sleep, Melvins), who set the controls on the record ‘Tsunamicron’. The Lions of Tsavo are also set to release a new album entitled “Firelung” in 2008 on Ovrcast. Firelung was recorded by Bryan Richie (The Sword), mixed by Sanford Parker, and mastered by Collin Jordan.
