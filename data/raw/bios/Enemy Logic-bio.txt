Enemy Logic is a 4 piece metalcore onslaught hailing from the musical breeding grounds of Cork, Ireland and is a rising force in the world of metal.

The band’s music is a blend of skilful, fast paced, and masterful guitar work combined with cutting, aggressive, and technical riffing. Wide ranging vocals, moving from deep guttural roars and high pitched, gut wrenching screams to catchy hooks and driving melodies. Relentless, impeccable drumming together with thunderous, galloping beats at a blistering fast speed. Along with gruelling and punishing, bone crushing breakdowns. Mature song writing mixed with this pure aggression and emotion allow Enemy Logic to engulf it’s listeners in a wall of heavy, brutal, and melodic sound.

The band’s style is comparable to those of All That Remains, Silent Civilian, and As I Lay Dying. However their music also displays influences from varied metal acts such as All Shall Perish, Soilwork, and Megadeth.

Enemy Logic is currently finishing writing material for their debut EP and when it is released, the world will see what this metal onslaught has to offer. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Enemy+Logic">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
