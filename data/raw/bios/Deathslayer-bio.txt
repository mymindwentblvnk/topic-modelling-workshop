Deathslayer from New York was a female fronted epic metal group. Their first demo "Cry of the Sword" (1984) includes a bunch of great tracks ("Cry of the Swords", "Journey for Light" and "Deathslayer"). They may bring to one's mind other awesome bands of the US metal scene, such as Omen, Sound Barrier, Heathen's Rage etc. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/deathslayer">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
