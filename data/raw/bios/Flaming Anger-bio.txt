Flaming Anger were a technical/progressive power/thrash metal band from Germany  (Bochum, North Rhine-Westphalia). They were formed in 1984 and have a limited number of releases;  3 demo tapes, and one album: Biosphere II (1997), which was released on cream records. Apparently there is another, harder to find '86 demo. Former members of the band have been involved in many different German Metal acts, including Kreator.
