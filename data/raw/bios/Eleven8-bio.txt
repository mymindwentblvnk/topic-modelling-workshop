Edd Legg (Eleven8) has been building steam within the dubstep and d&b scenes for the last few years, originally being noticed for dubstep sets featuring live drums and hosting a wide range of influences from his background producing post rock and electronic music. He studied ‘Urban and Electronic Music’ at Southampton Solent so is no stranger to production techniques, and recently all the hard work’s payed off with a track (Colours of Distance) just released on Med School’s ‘New Blood 011 Ep’, which adopts a chilled, spacious, down tempo style he’s developed that’s really doing it for me right now! He was kind enough to come through and answer a few questions for us.
