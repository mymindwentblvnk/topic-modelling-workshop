MOUNTAIN WITCH is a stoner / doom outfit from Hamburg, Germany.

Founded in 2008 as a two piece by René Sitte (Guitar) and René Roggmann (Drums, Vocals), Tobert Knopp (Bass) is now completing the trinity.

The goal is to create music that is rooted in stoner and doom music from the past and present with psychedelic elements.

Inspiration is drawn from old & forgotten movies and vintage gear which gives the distinctive sound of the band.

In 2010 the first LP "Scythe & Dead Horse" was released in a lim. edition of 100 copies by the german label Droehnhaus which is sold out. On the 26.01.2011 a new "s/t" 12" Ep was released lim.300 - again on Droehnhaus..

To describe the sound of the band imagine as if Electric Wizard would play a little bit more Black Sabbath and clockwise.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mountain+Witch">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
