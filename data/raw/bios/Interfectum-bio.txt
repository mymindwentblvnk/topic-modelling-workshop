Interfectum from Naaldwijk, the Netherlands was formed in 2007. The band combines thrash- and black metal music with progressive elements.

Bass player Thijs van der Burg and drummer Elmer van der Spek where lookin' for a guitar player to form a metalband. After a long search they found Steven Otto, who instantly joined the band after Thijs threatened him with a knife. Interfectum was formed with Thijs on vocals/bass guitar, Steven on lead-/rhythm guitar and Elmer on Drums.

In early 2009 the demo CD "Realms of the Dead" was released online and the band started to do live performances.

In December 2009 Interfectum released their promo EP, "Incarnation of Evil" that can be downloaded at their official myspace:
