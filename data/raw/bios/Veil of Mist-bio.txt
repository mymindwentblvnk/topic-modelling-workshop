Veil Of Mist is a French female fronted metal band, whose origins date back to 2004.
The band released two EPs, Industry of Guilt (2006) and Dangling Hopes (2008), but it wasn't until massive line-up changes in 2013-2014 that the band recorded and released an official full-length debut.
The debut titled "Disenchantment" was relased in November 2016 under Valkyrie Rising label. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Veil+of+Mist">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
