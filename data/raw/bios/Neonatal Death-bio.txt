Neonatal Death, one-man Goregrind from Scotland.

Formed in early '07 as a result of relentless boredom.

Releases include a couple of demos, a full length album (Severe Facial Reconstruction) and most recently, an EP entitled The Drunk Cunt Grinds Again.

Every now and then someone is daft enough to book us. On these rare occasions Jim can magically mold other band members from his beard hairs and end up performing not as one drunken asshat, but as a full live band of drunken asshats (who, incidentally, are ugly as sin). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Neonatal+Death">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
