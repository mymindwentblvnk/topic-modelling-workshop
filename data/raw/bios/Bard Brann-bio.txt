Formerly a three-piece traditional black metal group known as Kampfgruppe 829 (KG 829), this original group split some time in 2005. Since that time Bard Brann has become a solo act with a new direction and a slightly progressive sound.

Mikill has been onboard since early 2006 and is mainly involved in post-production.

Changed name to Conjuror in 2007. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bard+Brann">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
