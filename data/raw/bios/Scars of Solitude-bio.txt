Scars of Solitude is a melodic metal band from Äänekoski playing music rooted deep in the Finnish melancholy. The band was formed in January 2015 and has stood firmly and proud behind its music ever since. Their music sounds like autumn - it's kinda dark, rainy and cold but still rich in both beauty and colour despite all the despair. Having their debut album, Deformation, released in the end of 2017, Scars of Solitude has operated as a trio after parting ways with both former singer Mikko Ruuska and guitarist Antti Kettunen, and Laulainen taking up the vocalist’s duties.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Scars+of+Solitude">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
