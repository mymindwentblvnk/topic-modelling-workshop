Carnac is a death metal band from Turkey. The band was formed in 2014 and a year later in 2015, they released their first official work "The Frail Sight." Four-track EP. In May 2017, the band released their first LP ''Times Undone'' via Sliptrick Records, and received positive critics world wide. In late 2019, two of the original members left and the band became a trio.

Their latest record "Barren Wastes of Want" was released on December 17th, 2021.  Mixed and mastered by Achilleas Kalantzis (Aenaon, Varathron, Katavasia) once again, the band now seeks a much darker and heavier sound that matches the viciousness of the songs. With the fast-paced and aggressive "Barren Wastes of Want", Carnac manages to combine melodic black metal elements with the raw energy of death metal.
