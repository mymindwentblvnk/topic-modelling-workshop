5 guys sharing the same interest in listening to various styles of metal (deathcore, death metal, grindcore) and tearing up stages with their brutal noise. Drawing influence from such bands as Rose Funeral, Ion Dissonance, Suicide Silence & Whitechapel and sharing the stage with established acts like Arise and Ruin, Beneath The Massacre, Misguided Aggression, Endast; Straight Reads The Line; Suffokate; Arsonists Get All The Girls & The Last Felony. Also looking to branch out and play new cities/venues and tear sh*t up!!! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ending+Tyranny">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
