Celelalte Cuvinte (The Other Words) is a Romanian rock band from Oradea, Romania, founded in December 1981, in Timi»ôoara and still active to this day. Although it is generally accepted that Celelalte Cuvinte is a Heavy Metal band, the members experienced some other genres like doom metal in the Armaghedon album - an almost unique experience in Romanian rock music, some influences being present also in the Destin album of the band Cargo - or, recently, like alternative rock - in the NOS album.
Celelalte Cuvinte is the first Romanian rock band that actually got the attention of the audiences that wanted elaborated music, after Phoenix left the country. However, the  Armaghedon album is definitely an underground one, so the band is both important for mainstream and underground Romanian music.
On September 12, 2008, the band has decided to make two songs form the new album - "Stem" and "Zmeie", the single that promotes the new album, available for streaming on their MySpace page. The album, called "Stem", was released in October 2008.
The band continues to play concerts all over Romania.
Celelalte Cuvinte is the only Romanian band that considers its sound engineer a full band member. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Celelalte+Cuvinte">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
