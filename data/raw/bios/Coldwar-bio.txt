Formed in 1999 in Dublin, Ireland, Coldwar are influenced by underground hardcore punk and extreme metal. Fuelled by a 
 rejection of Church & State institutions and other oppressive, 
 intolerant and absolutist states of mind.

 To date Coldwar have toured Ireland/UK as well as having made several trips to Europe and the USA. The band have also played a number of festivals including Wacken Open Air (Germany), Obscene Extreme Festival (Czech Republic), Load As Fuck (USA), Day Of Darkness (Ireland), Up the Punks (UK), Cork Winter Fest (Ireland), Burning Oak Festival (Ireland), Subvert Festival (UK) and more. 

 Coldwar have shared the stage and toured alongside bands such as Fear Factory, Soulfly, Sepultura, EHG, Suffocation, Anthrax, Hatebreed, Napalm Death and many more. 

 With four releases previous since their inception via Underground Movement each release has gained the band a growing fan base. 

 In 2014 Coldwar signed a deal with Candlelight Records marking the start of a new chapter for the band beginning with the release of the fifth Coldwar record ‘Panthiest’.
