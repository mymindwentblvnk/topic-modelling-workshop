Nailed Coil is a metal band from Tuusula Finland.

Mixing up thrashy attitude with rock groove is what Nailed Coil represents soundwise. Livewise Nailed Coil raises the bar for the term live show by combining scillful playing as indivituals and bringing the house down together as a hard hitting metal act.

NC has been around from 2003 mainly playing local shows in Finland and building up a fanbase. After recording three promo cd:s and later their first album (trail of yesterday) and seeing a bit of the european metal scene after playing the metalcamp 2008 the hunger grew.

Now grasping the challenge with a new gameface and the toughest album in the scene NC brings you "The Outcome Of Anxiety" a breath of fresh air for metal heads â€¦

Everything ready for the road with a ready album and a group to take up the upcoming challenges with a kick ass yet professional attitude.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nailed+Coil">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
