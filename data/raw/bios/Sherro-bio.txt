Born in Florida and raised in Houston, Sherro, aka The Big Boss Dogg, has been a born hustler ever since he could remember. His family moved to Houston, TX when he was two years old. As he grew older, the need for him to make his own money grew stronger. He would take out his neighbors’ trash for a dollar or help them move for ten. Now, that he’s grown and representin the S.W.A.T., not much has changed. He’s hustling into this music game. With lines like “Anything that I do is because I luv paper/ got my mind on my money, got my eyes on these haters/ cruisin’ through the streets with my money right behind me/ and my credit is good, so I don’t need no cosignin’…” we know his songs are going to bring that fire. Look out for his upcoming projects real soon! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sherro">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
