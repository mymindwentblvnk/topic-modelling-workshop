Basarab is the brainchild of Dennis, an experimental manifestation of his vision of combining baroque style composing with the sound of extreme metal. Encouraged by Fabian from german Metal Band Odium Immortalis, the first Demo "Pride of Older Times" was created 2003. Equipment was near to none, the guitar recordings played by Fabian had to be exchanged via Internet. A Split with Odium Immortalis was also recorded at end of 2003.

Difficult changes and experiences in the life of mastermind Dennis kept Basarab silent until now. Equipment is still near to none, but new courage and inspiration led to the recording of "Reconciliation"; the 2007 Demo which is soon to be released, this time with Basarab as a real one-man-project. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Basarab">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
