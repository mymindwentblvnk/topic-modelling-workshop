Formed in Minneapolis Minnesota in early 2004, Epicurean began developing their musical vision. Setting out to mend together a European influenced sound, with a deeply progressive nature, while at the same time, keeping their sound accessible. Not long after, the group started to hit the road, beginning the relentless touring schedule the band is still known for.

Two straight years of touring not only gained Epicurean a reputation as an intense and powerful live act; it also allowed them to compile the material for their debut record, “A Consequence of Design.” The guys then teamed up with producer Ari, and Inner Light studios to take on the project of tracking their debut release.

Later that year, Epicurean caught the attention of famed producer Don Debiase who then passed the band on to Manager Neil Sheehan. After signing on with Sheehan and HM Management, he began presenting the band to labels.

Not long after, Epicurean began receiving interest from Metal Blade Records, and in March of 2007, the band accepted the offer and joined the Metal Blade Family.

In May of 2007, following an appearance at the New England Metal And Hardcore Festival, the band will be joining with Don Debiase and Track 6 Studios to remix/re-master “A Consequence of Design” as well as record 2 additional tracks.

Already looking at a hectic touring schedule, Epicurean is setting out to promote their debut release, which will be released in January of 2008 through Metal Blade Records. As of now, the band is stronger and more focused than ever, and most likely coming to a town near you very soon…
