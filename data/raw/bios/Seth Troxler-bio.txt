As a comparable youth on the scene, Seth Troxler's achievements far outweigh his tender age of 22. His Detroit roots are unmistakable and his recent relocation to Berlin has already earned him a place in the elite of the European techno scene.

Seth's musical influences include the chirping of crickets, the whirring of space ships, and the sweet sounds of whistling voodoo magic. With much-hyped and played releases on revered labels such as Spectral, Wagon Repair and M_NUS, each join the dots of his distinctive sexy techno sound.

On 2008, Seth was welcomed onto the Rebel Agency and he earmarked the wonderful Love Never Sleeps for Crosstown Rebels.

Seth started 2009 by releasing the Aphrika EP on Wolf + Lamb.
