Future Bible Heroes are another band formed under the wings of Stephin Merritt, this time with his friend Chris Ewen. Merritt (words and melodies) and Ewen (instruments) formed a bond through their mutual love of chanteuse Yma Sumac, composer John Cage, and the collecting of exotic instruments and Tiki art.
