Wishmasters is a cover band of Nightwish. Its birth dates back to Three Kings, 6th January 2007. Thanks God and our drummer Lukas who gave rise to us. It was actually his idea and dream to play the Nightwish music, which came true when he met Iveta- our very talented young singer. Our very first song was Sleeping Sun, where Iveta proved her exceptional voice and talent . During the following months, we practised one song per each rehearsal, which was not an easy process. Except the instruments and singing, there were many things to be done, such as the instrumentation of the whole orchestra. However and therefore, we are now a kind of "unique" cover band of Nightwish. The very first concert we had took place at Dlouhe Zahony in Upice, 30th April 2007. Since then, we have plenty of other succesful concerts with lots of new and satisfied fans. We are looking forward to next concerts but the most to YOU, our fans. Without you we're nothing… Thank you! And stay tuned…
