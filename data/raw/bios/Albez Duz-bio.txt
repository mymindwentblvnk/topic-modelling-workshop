In 2009, the human being still thinks of himself as the top of Creation. He strives towards alleged triumph without fail, however, fervour and greed often obstruct one's view. Even the so called alternative and liberal Rock movement cannot disengage itself from these narrow-minded attitudes. It is all about the perfect sound, the perfect song, the perfect band – yet the soul of both music and  spiritual verses fall by the wayside in this sick drive for perfection!

The German Albez Duz oppose this drive without the will to improve this planet just a single bit.  These gentlemen are neither into perfection nor being a philanthropic Samaritan. Albez Duz is about blood, occultism, the drive for Gnosis, the savouring of nostalgia and melancholy. The aim is not to indoctrinate but to offer a balance to society – a spiritual sanctuary.

Accomplishing these goals is not difficult for these guys since Albez Duz is not a bunch of irrelevant amateurs. These men are not half-baked since they have already played in more than successful bands of different genres especially. Needless to say they possess a superior musical background.

Accordingly diversified are the influences Albez Duz assimilate for their unique Occult Doom Rock: early  Paradise Lost, Tiamat and My Dying Bride provide for a melancholic yet powerful felling whereas bands like Pink Floyd, Hawkwind or Black Widow were the inspiration for the spiritual impact. The band considers itself as unity that consequently abstains from any names and rather focusses on their artistic performance than on image and personality cult. Albez Duz is not about being innovative at any cost but about bridging towards the past, a path back to instinctiveness and the picking up of a nostalgic atmosphere.   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Albez+Duz">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
