Fliegend was born in Santiago, Chile in 2007, a project created by Psychopath and Malaquias, two psychos inspired on Depressive Black Metal music. Both madmen that found this music like a very representative style from special people who is very stronged and genius in this kind of world. Fliegend (flying in German) is one of the first bands from Depressive and Ambient Black Metal music found in Chile. They are not so many here. This style is new and one of the best ways to say HATE in different languages. Fliegend inspires suicidal and melancholy memories songs, sees the life like one precious game made of daily rituals at different stages. A new Era begins and Fliegend is part of that with its sad ambient and harrowing lyrics.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fliegend">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
