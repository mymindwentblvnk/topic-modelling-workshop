Funebre Inferi was a Greek black metal band, known formerly as Hieronym Inferiorum. The band's mastermind and only member Nowead Luczebeus Sutagel changed the band name to this in sometime in 1996 and released a demo tape "Deathcult" which was re-released year later as a split with Wintergods.

The 1997 split seems also to be the last sign of life from the band. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Funebre+Inferi">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
