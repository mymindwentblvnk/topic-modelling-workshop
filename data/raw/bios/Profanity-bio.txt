Most people say that the music is a mix of SUFFOCATION, MONSTROSITY and CANNIBAL CORPSE,.

PROFANITY played many gigs, one of them with CANNIBAL CORPSE, KRABATHOR and DEVILYN in Munich, killer open-airs like FUCK THE COMMERCE II + III, Obscene Extreme Festival 2000 (Cz), HELL ON EARTH (Austria), MOUNTAINS OF DEATH (Swiss), the UUDAYS and a lot of gigs with bands like PURGATORY, VADER, BLOOD, FLESHLESS, SUDDEN DEATH, KRONOS, FLESHCRAWL, SANITYS DAWN, APOPHIS, INHUMATE, ANASARCA, MANGLED, TEARS OF DECAY, GODS OF EMPTINESS and many, many more.

At the moment PROFANITY are writing new material for their third album, using many new elements and finding for themself a new vision of extreme music, it will be more than Death Metal.
