Born in 2004, THUNDERTALE today is one the most productive metal bands in Lithuania – three full studio albums and one DVD in 5 years – now that's something for a scene where any new release is a
big event... 
Members of the band believe in the spirit of Heavy Metal with all of their hearts and they have big plans for the future. Through the music THUNDERTALE represent the spirit of ancient Lithuanian warriors, their ideas of honour, strength and heroism. Lithuanian folk elements and links to hoary Lithuanian war songs are used together with Heavy / Power Metal compositions. FOR THE HOMELAND! – It is the slogan, which guides the five musicians..
Piety to glorious past of their homeland and trust in eternal truths inspires THUNDERTALE to produce great Heavy / Power Metal, conveying historic legacy of their nation. THUNDERTALE write songs in English and Lithuanian, and this enables them to have different programs in each language - in total it makes more than two hours of show! And what is more, last summer the band introduced their new acoustic program! 
See them live… hear the old Tales of Thunder, told to you by THUNDERTALE!
