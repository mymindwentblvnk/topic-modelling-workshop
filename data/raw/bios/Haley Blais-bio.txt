It’s hard not to fall in love with Blais as she expertly puts into song so much of what humans are feeling. Hailing from Vancouver, BC, Haley Blais began her musical career as a solo folk artist. After her debut EP Late Bloomer (2016) was released independently online by demand of her YouTube subscribers, Haley went from single white female yielding ukulele, to five piece band. Let Yourself Go, a 5 track EP, set to be released April 2018, will feature a more mature sound of folk rock and pop. The EP lyrically stays true to Haley’s comedic side, while showcasing the evolution of her musicality. While Late Bloomer focused on the grief of a former self, Let Yourself Go is a commentary on where Blais is going after she’s bloomed. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Haley+Blais">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
