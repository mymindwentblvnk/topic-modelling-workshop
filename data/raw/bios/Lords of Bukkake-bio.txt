This psychedelic sludge doom power trio from Barcelona, Spain were formed in 2003 by members of underground Spanish bands like Sons Of Bronson (power electronics), Taunus (stoner rock) and Unabomber (grindcore). They have noted Grief, Godflesh, Sleep, Bongzilla, Iron Monkey, Electric Wizard, Swans and Today Is The Day as key influences to their sound. After several line-up changes they recorded their first album in 2007. "Lords Of Bukkake" was mastered by Billy Anderson (Neurosis, Sleep, High On Fire, Eyehategod) and finally released in September 2008 by labels Odio Sonoro and Gaia Records.
