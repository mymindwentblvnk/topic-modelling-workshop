Blood Stained Host were born in 1994, under the will of Eric Giancaterino and Emilio Chella, both ex members of a local band called Keening. Once completed the line-up, the band records the first demo tape called "Blood Stained Host", which helps the band in moving its first steps into the underground. But a broader response is obtained with the second demo tape entitled "Mirror of Soul", published in 1995, that shows a band devoted to a doom death with many melodic parts and with some dark influences. The following year, 1996, brings some news: line-up changes and a complex musical evolution that takes shape in the third demo tape "Loosing the Light", probably the most complete and ripe work recorded by the band until then. The band writes new material during the whole 1997 and at the beginning of 1998 the band gets signed to The Twelfth Planet Records, for the releasing of its first full-length entitled "Individual Theatre". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Blood+Stained+Host">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
