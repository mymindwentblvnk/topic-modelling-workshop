Black Celebration is a Depeche Mode tribute band from Crewe (UK); amazingly enough, they really sound as Depeche Mode. You can hear some of their stuff on their MySpace page and watch some of their performances through their youtube channel. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Black+Celebration">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
