ENDLESS TORTURE has their home in Östersund, Sweden. 40 minutes flying north from the capital Stockholm. The band was created the summer of 2006 and pretty soon they got to record their first demo which you probably are holding in your hands, or even better, listening to right now. The lineup is the same today as it was from the start. Peter Mellgren (A*TEEM, HÅRDROCKSBANDET) on vocals, Marcus Edvardsson (SOULDRAINER, CHASTISEMENT, SANCTIFICATION) on guitars/bass and Tom Åsvold (DIMENSION 34, PAINCRAZE, HÅRDROCKSBANDET) on the drums. All three members are experienced and professional musicians who live, breathe and eat music.

The demo AT WAR WITH WAR is just a taste of the style, aggression and attitude that ENDLESS TORTURE is all about. The lyrical content covers the bad sides of the world such as all the war, death and destruction going on. You might hear influences from KREATOR, ANNIHILATOR, EXODUS together with a certain swedish flavor like early THE HAUNTED, CORPORATION 187, CARNAL FORGE or OPPRESSION in it.  The goal after this demo is to write more songs and as today more new killer songs has already been written. An album is planned to be recorded 2007 and hopefully find someone who are interested in releasing it or make a contract out of it. The album KILLING CAROLS was relesed October 2007.
