Centurian was raised in January 1997 from the smoldering remains of Thrash/Death metal band Inquisitor. Drummer Wim van der Valk and guitar player Rob Oorthuis decided to continue the band with a new name, changing their musical style to very fast and aggressive Death metal. This style has been the trademark of Centurian ever since. Influenced by bands like Morbid Angel, Krisiun and Deicide, Centurian nevertheless created their very own sound. Joined by vocalist Seth van de Loo, Centurian started off playing gigs in May 1997. Later the same year they recorded their first 8 track CD entitled "Of Purest Fire". This promo/demo CD proved to be very successful, receiving lots of very good reviews in the Underground Metal scene, and led to some nice offers from record labels.

They have disbanded in 2015. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Centurian">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
