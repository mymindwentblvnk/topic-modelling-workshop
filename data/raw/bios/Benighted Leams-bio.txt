BENIGHTED LEAMS formed in 1995, in a hellhole of dismal squalour and desolation.

The first album was released in the Autumn of 1996 with the name "Caliginous Romantic Myth". It combined a sad, Doomy atmosphere with necro Black Metal.

The second album was released in the Spring of 1998 with the name "Astral Tenebrion". It was more orchestrated than its predecessor and contained some ambient sections. Influences from cosmology and astrophysical theory were in evidence. Only 500 copies were made.

None of the above is available any longer.

A Third album was released in 2004. This material dated back from the Autumn of 1998 and is radically different from the earlier work. The sound is a mixture of BETHLEHEM circa "S.U.I.Z.I.D." and VOIVOD "Killing Technology".
