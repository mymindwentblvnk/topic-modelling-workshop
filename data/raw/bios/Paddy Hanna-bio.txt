Paddy Hanna is one of the most prolific musicians in Dublin, Ireland, the lead singer in Grand Pocket Orchestra he’s also heavily involved in independent label Popical Island. Grand Pocket Orchestra can be quite frantic onstage, a live show you won’t forget and Paddy as a front man is at the helm of that. With that in mind, it’s quite a wonderful surprise to hear his solo material take a different direction. His band is compiled of No Monster Club’s Bobby Aherne on bass and Grand Pocket Orchestra's Enda Canavan on drums and Mark Chester of Ginnels fame on guitar. These are gorgeous tracks, and who knew Paddy Hanna had such a warm tone to his voice.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Paddy+Hanna">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
