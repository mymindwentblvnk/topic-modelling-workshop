Wastefall were born on February of 2003 by Domenik and Alex (ex Dead man’s tale). Later on George Kanavaris joined the band behind the drums and Ilias Kalivas on the bass guitar. Wastefall signed, a two-albums contract with Sleaszy Rider records and released their debut album “Fallen stars and rising scars” on the 28th of July 2003. Due to the encouraging feedback Wastefall, started working on new ideas and creations for a future release. 
Later on Ilias Kalyvas (bass player) left the band and Stratos Haidos (bass player) joined it. Matthew Dakoutros (violin) and Chris Kyrkilis (keyboards) joined the band, shortly after. 
After a long time of rehearsals and composing new material Wastefall entered Fragile studios on the 4th of May 2004. On the 7th of November 2004 “Soulrain 21” was released. Stratos Haidos (bass player) left Wastefall and Nick Valetzis (current bass player) joined the band. After Nick’s arrival, Wastefall had to split ways with violin player, Matthew Dakoutros and drums player George Kanavaris due to musical differences. A few months after Wastefall, recruited Kostis Papaleksopoulos as their new percussion and drums player.
Two years after their successful second album “Soulrain 21”, Wastefall’s third release entitled, “Self Exile” was recorded during December and January of 2006. The album was mixed and mastered by Tommy Hansen (Helloween, TNT, Jorn Lande etc.) at Jailhouse Studios, Denmark. “Self Exile” was released in the U.S.A. and Europe on the 6th of June 2006(Release Date for Greece – 12th of June 2006 and release date for France – October of 2006). Many gigs followed in Europe and Greece. 
In 2008 the band split-up due to personal reasons. But the lust for music never went away, so Domenik, Nick and Alex decided to reactivate Wastefall on January of 2013. Many songs are ready and an EP called "Meridiem" is on the way.

The long awaited “Meridiem” E.P. by Greek prog- heavy metal pioneers is going to be released on the 12th of April 2013. You can purchase it via Itunes, Amazon MP3, Deezer, Google Play, Xbox Music and many other digital stores. You will be able to purchase it also through the official Wastefall site, which is going to be launched very soon. Limited physical copies will be available sometime after the digital release.
