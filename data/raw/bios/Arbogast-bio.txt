arbogast is an American band out of Chicago who may enter the description as a fast-rock-metal band but they appreciate and integrate a variety of textures and rhythms in their songwriting.  They played their first show in February of 2009 and since have played shows around Chicago and the Midwest.  They self-released the 'arbogast EP' Nov 13th and are the midst of recording the second release this January.  Look for that sometime in the spring.
