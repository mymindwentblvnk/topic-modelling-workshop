From the grim waters of the river Medway rise a band with fierce intention and an ambition that will not be stopped. Feed The Rhino are currently tearing venues apart up and down the UK with their soaring live show that simply has to be seen. Their debut release, MR REDEYE! Is still lingering in the hearts of fans and industry alike and with the support and high reviews from the heavy music press family including Kerrang, Metal Hammer and Rock Sound, It's no wonder the band have elavated to the top of the noise chain!


As much as the no stone unturned detail, relentless tracking and sheer hard work is clear for all to hear in Mr Redeye , The band are all about their beautifully brutal live shows. It's an energy like no other when the Rhino comes to town and a spectacle that holds no bars and leaves the hardest meat head with a chill to take legs away. After being picked up by GALLOWS bassist, Stu Gili-Ross, the band have have been perfecting their trade with the UK's elite for the last two years and just embarked on a summer packed full of festival highlights. With the daunting task of being the last band announced on this year's Sonisphere, the Rhino responded with an epic performance which was rewarded with a whole new fan base and a 5 K's review in Kerrang to boot. The band then steamed into a massive main stage frenzy at Hevy Festival, not to mention "2000 Trees" and Nottingham's "Hit The Deck" to name a few.

The rest of 2011 and beyond look as promising as it gets for Kent quintet, and by the speed and verocity this band have shown since forming, it seems Feed The Rhino is here to stay!! Miss this band at your peril.
