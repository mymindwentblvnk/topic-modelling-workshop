Sons of Balaur are a true kult Black Metal band based in Oslo, Norway. Formed in March, 1992, the band were part of the original first wave of Norwegian Black Metal – a notorious inner circle of underground artists who took music to extremes it had never previously reached. Started in secret, for obvious reasons, the band features some of Norwegian Black Metal’s most dedicated and shadowy personalities: Tomas – vocals and guitar, Markus – bass guitar, Kristoffer – guitar, and Lars – drums. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sons+Of+Balaur">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
