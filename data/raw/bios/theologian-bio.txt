A project by Leech (formerly of Navicon Torture Technologies) which publicly came into being in 2009 with the release of A Life Of Constant Struggle on Danvers State Recordings, broadly coinciding with the final era of NTT releases. Described initially by Leech as follows:

"THEOLOGIAN will chronicle the development of my own personal mythology inspired by concepts introduced into the public consciousness by Clive Barker in his short novel THE HELLBOUND HEART, intertwined with ideas derived from Wayne Douglas Barlowe in his INFERNO series. These concepts have obviously been a part of certain NTT material for some time, but in a peripheral sense. THEOLOGIAN is a continued aural exploration into the higher reaches of experience. Expressions of love and obsession, the loss of self and the corruption of the soul through addictions to carnality and temporal lusts."
