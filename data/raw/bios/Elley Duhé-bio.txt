Elley Duh√© (born February 14, 1992) is an American singer and songwriter. Born near Mobile, Alabama, she was raised on the Gulf Coast in the small towns of Vancleave, Mississippi and Dauphin Island, Alabama, inspired by her musician father and uncles who are in the orbit of the New Orleans music scene. 

After her father got Elley her first guitar when she was 14, she began her career at 15 singing in coffee shops. Graduating to paying gigs in bars, restaurants, and at private parties, she gained enough exposure to be booked to open for national acts and connect with songwriters in Nashville, Los Angeles, and Austin, where, after dropping out of high school and getting her GED, she spent three years honing her craft. She now lives in Los Angeles.

The single "Millennium", her collaboration with electronic producer Tarro, released in October 2016, was viewed over two million times on YouTube and streamed 1.4 million times on Spotify.

After Billboard premiered her single "Immortal" in December 2016, it gained 4.5 million streams on Spotify, while the video netted nearly a million views on YouTube. A remix by DJ duo Snakehips netted an additional 770,000 Spotify streams.

Her follow-up single "Fly", released in July 2017, featured production from ILLA and Cool & Dre (Christina Milian, Lil Wayne).

In July 2018, she collaborated with Russian-German music producer Zedd on the single "Happy Now".

On August 3, 2018, her collaborative single with Gryffin, "Tie Me Down", was released. On August 10, 2018, she released the EP Dragon Mentality. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Elley+Duh%C3%A9">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
