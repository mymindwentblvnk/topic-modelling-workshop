Angelcorpus did start in 2001 when Marius meets Diana Trujillo and Marcus; at beginning They worked as a trio under the name of Angelblood whose main purpose was making a new rock-metal style involving classical elements such as baroque and romanticism and 80's musical influences too. Short after Pavel, a bassit that used to play with Marius in former projects, joined the band so that Angelcorpus became a quartet that in its first gigs used to play with drum machine and sequencers, it was until Jose Luis Chicaiza joined in to do the drums duties.

In 2003 the band did record Crystal Flowers, a EP with the songs Crystal Flowers, Inmensidad, Signs and Inside.
In 2004 Diana quit the band and Nicole Khoury joined in but short after quit, then Diana Gonzalez let in as new singer, also in this time R.I.P. Richards joined the band as permanent keyboardist. In the next year Angelcorpus did record the single Jasmine Nights featured by Claudia as lyric singer.
In 2006, year in which Melancholia's record sessions started, Diana left the band , Richards did move to Atlanta, GA and Marius decided no continue so that it had seemed Angelcorpus had finished but in 2007 the band restarted with a new line-up , Sargon in the drums, A.C. Ronalds in the bass, Ricardo in the keyboards and Nicole joined in again. In spite of Richards foreign residence He continues in Angelcorpus as honor member because of his constant support. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Angelcorpus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
