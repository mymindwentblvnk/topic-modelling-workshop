The band was founded in December 2010 by Marco (guitar), Matteo (growls and guitar) and Max (drums). Their aim was to mix Death Metal to traditional folk music.
After a couple of months Demetrio (bagpipes, whistles and accordion), Sara (vocals, bagpipes), Leonardo (scream and clean vocals, bass) and Francesco Salviato (violin) joined the band.
Their first EP, "Stories of North", was released in May 2012, containing 5 tracks:
-Voices of North
-Silence Oblivion
-Cor Ui Vallorch
-The End
-Mourn (Outro)
In July 2012 the band played at Folk Festival in Piacenza as supporter to Corvus Corax. Two weeks later they performed at Fosch Fest in Bergamo opening for international bands, such as Trollfest, Negura Bunget, Kivimetsan Druidi and Folkstone.
In September 2012 they were ready to record their first full-length album and went to Parma, at Moonlight Records and Studios, their actual label. While recording, they had the great chance to open for Arkona in occasion of their 10 years anniversary tour, at Circolo Colony in Brescia.
Francesco decided to leave the band due to personal reasons, and was replaced by Martina Mezzalira.
The day of the album release, expected for January, 21, had a considerable delay due to a third party, and was finally postponed to January, 11. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vallorch">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
