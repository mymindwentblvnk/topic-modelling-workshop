Hiverna is a folk black metal band from Quebec formed in april 2006. Bardunor (David Verret) (Monarque, Crépuscule, Valknacht, Barol Svinge) started composing Folkish Black Metal Symphonies in 2004 and talked to Helorth (Alexandre Garneau) (Barol Svinge) about this project he wanted to build. The two-men band called their project Hiverna, to remind the cold winters, the wind blowing towards the icy lands and the snow, falling, freezing, whitening the realms.

Four other members joined the adventure: Mathieu "Matoleos" Petigrou (Drums) (Valknacht, Ancient Winds), Yannick Hold Geoffroy (Keyboards), Mireille Gagnon (flute) and Rémi "Froidure" Plamondon (Bass) (Froidure). The second guitarist is now (2007) Marc-Olivier Girard. In February  2009 Doom joined the band with her flute.

In February 2008 L'Aube Septentrionale, a split with Chasse-Galerie was released, containing four songs.
