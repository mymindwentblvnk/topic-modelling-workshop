Blaque is an American girl group that charted from 1999 to 2004. Their self-titled debut album Blaque sold more than 1 million copies and was certified Platinum. The group's debut included the platinum-selling lead single "808", a second single, "I Do" and the international pop hit "Bring It All to Me". In 1999, Billboard named Blaque the 4th Best New Artist of the year, with "Bring It All to Me" landing at number 30 on the 2000 Year End Chart. In 2002 and 2003, the group released three less successful singles, "Can't Get It Back", "Ugly" and "I'm Good", the latter appearing in the film Honey.

Blaque worked on two unreleased albums in the mid-to-late 2000s before their disbandment in 2008. The group attempted a comeback in 2012, but it was cut short by Natina Reed's accidental death. In 2019, Blaqueâ€™s intended third album Torch was released under the label Blaque/The Move Entertainment. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Blaque">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
