AFTER FALL OUT OF LAKE WORTH, FLORIDA COMBINE RAW AGGRESSION, INTELLIGENT LYRICS AND A HEAD ON COLLISION OF OLD AND NEW SCHOOL METAL THAT DRIVES CROWDS TO A FRENZIED RESPONSE, WHILE STILL MANAGING TO YANK EVERYONE ALONG ON A TWISTED, ROLLER COASTER RIDE WITH A RARELY HEARD DIVERSITY IN TODAYS HEAVY MUSIC SCENE. AFTER FALL FORMED IN 2000 AS "RICTUS GRIN" AND AFTER SEVERAL LINEUP CHANGES, EMERGED IN 2002 AS "AFTER FALL" WITH A RICH DIVERSITY OF INFLUENCES FROM IT'S FIVE MEMBERS THAT RANGES FROM PANTERA TO BLACK LABEL SOCIETY TO PINK FLOYD AND ALL POINTS IN BETWEEN. STUBBORN AND UNWILLING TO BACK DOWN EVEN ONE INCH IN DELIVERING THEIR OWN PERSONAL BRAND OF METAL MAYHEM AND THE ALL CONSUMING GOAL OF PUTTING METAL BACK AT THE FOREFRONT OF THE MUSIC SCENE.....BE AFRAID!, BE VERY AFRAID!  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/After+Fall">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
