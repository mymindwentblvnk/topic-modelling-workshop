DEVOGGOL was born in january 2008, founded by Justin, K and Yari (Clitorideath's singer). After writing some tracks Marcus enter the band, so the definitive line-up.
Members always play in Stoner Kebab, By The Grief, Baikal and Ghost Empire.
DEVOGGOL looks like a 
speedrock/grime/garage/sludge band, a real no bass guitar experience.
