CLITGORE was found in 2007 at the initiative of Ela, ex Necrovile. Wanted to start a grindcore band formed by girls, but this proved impossible to achieve.

Ideas have been materialized in a number of pieces. Songs have a good brutal guitar & bass sound, perfect combination with guttural voice & fast drums blastbeat.

Since October 2009 Clitgore played more then 100 shows in country like Austria, Spain, France, Germany, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania.
