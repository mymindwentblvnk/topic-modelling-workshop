The Seshen is a San Francisco Bay Area-based band that draws influences from an eclectic range of artists including Little Dragon, J. Dilla, Erykah Badu and Beach House.  Their music fuses hip-hop, soul, pop and electronica, producing an original sound that is not bound to any particular genre.

Songs are created and performed by bassist/producer Aki Ehara, drummer 
Julian Pont, keyboardist Mahesh Rao, percussionist Mirza Kopelman and synchronizer/sampler Kumar Butler.  Driving beats laced with Afro-Caribbean percussion, thick bass lines, rich keyboards and textured electronic sampling provide the foundation for lyricists Lalin St. Juste and Akasha Orr, whose dreamy vocals create an ethereal sonic landscape. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Seshen">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
