There are three artists called "Mirkwood":

Mirkwood recorded just one eponymous album on the Flams Ltd label. A mere 99 copies of the album were pressed, for family, friends and a few lucky fans. Some years later, the 'Mirkwood' album was listed as the most expensive in RECORD COLLECTOR magazine. It has since been re-released (www.redadmiralrecords.co.uk). With dual guitar battles and stoned vox, this record is a highlight hard-progessive rock with psychedelic influences.Seven lengthy tracks with incredible perfect rhythm changes,incredible fuzz leads with never ending harsh solos and also silent and epic tracks.
