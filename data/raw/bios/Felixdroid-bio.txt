Felixdroid was born in 1962 in Birmingham UK. From an early age he undertook classical piano lessons and composers such as Bach, Debussy and Satie quickly became firm favourites. Whilst attending Art School in Sheffield he was introduced to a recording studio where his appetite for new musical colours such as Cage, Reich, Stockhausen would feed his creativity and subsequently influence his work.

His current material ranges from simple acoustic piano pieces to complex electronic soundscapes. 

Felixdroid is excited by the vast sonic landscape that exists and strives to embrace all influences to enhance his work. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Felixdroid">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
