Tzaak is a musical project focused on mostly Black Metal influences
The project started a year ago when he recorded a riff which eventually turned in to the song Livet & Døden (Life & Death). The music had a much different style then his previous release called “Out of Hands”. As soon as the song Livet & Døden was finished, He wanted to make more songs which had a similar style. Eventually he made the decision to release it under a different project name which later became Tzaak. However since he was unhappy with the mixing of the songs he dropped the project for a while. A Few months later he had a school task to compose a song. So he just started recording new riffs that later turned into the song My Masterpiece. In that time he also made 3 other songs with the same guitar setting. The thought of making it to an album came through and it later became Gjemt Ondskap.
