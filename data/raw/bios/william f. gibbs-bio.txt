William F. Gibbs is a singer-songwriter from South Carolina. His debut album "My Fellow Sophisticates" was released on Old Man Records in June 2008. Here's What's being said about William's debut:

"The hooks come with baroque ornamentation on this debut that was original and eclectic enough to cut through the dozens of singer/songwriters that come across my desk. The South Carolinian is all over the musical map, but it's an interesting trip." - Josh Jackson editor of PASTE magazine

"without a doubt, some of the most beautiful melody lines we have heard this year. Don't expect a quick fix here. Sophisticates takes a few spins to sink in. But, if you're like us, about five or ten spins later...you will be addicted to this album." - Baby Sue LMNOP Reviews

"..an astoundingly mature release in his debut album"                      - Joe Kendrick of WNCW
"when this came in I told the other DJ's here that this would be one of the best releases of the year coming out of this region...so far no one's disagreeing with me"        - Kim Clark of WNCW <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/William+F.+Gibbs">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
