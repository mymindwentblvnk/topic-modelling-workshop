Ben Marc realized music was going to be his life. He studied classical double bass at Trinity College London.
He duly went on to work with artists, including Macy Grey, Amy Winehouse, Dizzee Rascal, the Charles Mingus Big Band, Jimmy Cliff and created a film score with Radiohead.
He embarked on his own solo project. It is clear that he is merely scratching the surface of his ambitions just now. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ben+marc">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
