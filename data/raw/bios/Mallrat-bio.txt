Mallrat is Grace Shaw: a singer, songwriter and producer from Brisbane, Australia. Grace began uploading anthemic laptop tunes as a 16-year-old in 2015, quickly became a regular at the top of the Hype Machine charts, and in mid-2016 released her debut EP, Uninvited. Calling her "the Hannah Montana of the rap game," Nettwerk gave it a label release in early 2017, and her song "For Real" was licensed by Google for a smartphone commercial. In early 2018 she issued the more atmospheric "UFO," featuring Allday, and made her U.S. debut at South by Southwest. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mallrat">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
