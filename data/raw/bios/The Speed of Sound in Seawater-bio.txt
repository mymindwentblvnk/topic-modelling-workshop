Damien, Fernando, Jordan and Luke are some rad dudes that make up The Speed of Sound in Seawater. Supposedly, they're best friends, and this sound of theirs is the consequence of their love for one another, but I don't buy that one bit, because that's mad fruity (not that there's anything wrong with that). I think it's them trying to do some funky, fresh stuff that nobody else has done before. I mean, what kind of mathy, noodly goodness has come along and made girls drop their panties like this? I can't think of anything besides lying to them, telling them that you're still a virgin and you don't know a single thing about the art of sex. Yet now you do, because you've listened to this California based band several hundred times over. I mean, just the other day I played Red Version by these guys and was walked in on by my mom as I simulated coitus with my finger in my ear. I was like "moms, it's not what you think, listen to this jawn" then I turned on Romanticore and she took her underwear off. I was like "yo wtf that's gross, put them back on" and she did once I paused it. 

Note: The Speed of Sound in Seawater is not responsible for any damage caused by seeing your mother undress herself, but they'll totally take responsibility for getting you laid (unless that's with your mom)

2019 reunion was announced in April 2019.
