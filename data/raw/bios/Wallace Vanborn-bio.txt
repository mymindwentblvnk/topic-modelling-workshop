February 2006: Ian Clement, Sylvester Vanborm and Dries Hoof make their first live appearance as Wallace Vanborn, an eager and young three-piece rockband bringing a mixture of heavy stonerrock and sexy, danceable drumbeats. A magical formula that soon provided the band with a solid live reputation and the current nickname “Pletwallace” (Pletwals = the Dutch word for steamroller).

The band released their critically acclaimed debut “Free Blank Shots” early 2010. The album hit the web, sprung airplay for the first singles and resulted in tours throughout Belgium, The Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, France, the United Kingdom and along the USA Westcoast.

Wallace Vanborn made a smashing impression on the Eurosonic Festival in Groningen (2011), performed at the Sziget Festival (2011) and played over 100 shows in 11 different countries.

The band released their second album “Lions, Liars, Guns & God” in April 2012, produced and mixed by triple Grammy-winner David Bottrill, who also worked with Tool, Muse, Placebo, Smashing Pumpkins and dEUS. 

With 40 releases shows all over Europe (Benelux, Gas, Scandinavia, France, ...) and a festivalsummer including A-list festivals such as Pukkelpop and Dour Festival, Wallace Vanborn will finally confirm its status as one of the most promising European live rock acts of 2012.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wallace+Vanborn">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
