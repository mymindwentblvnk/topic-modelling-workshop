It all started in east Africa, to be precise in Nairobi, Kenya in 1992 where Jahcoustix found the music that would give his life a clear musical direction: Roots Reggae. Spending most of his youth days in African countries, Jahcoustix was fascinated by the African people and their positive attitude towards life thus living in severe poverty. As a sheltered white teenager, he saw himself confronted with the burning interest in this culture and its music.

As a child Jahcoustix spent many years in Mexico, Liberia and New York before moving to Kenya and Egypt. In Kenya he spent his free time wandering through the downtown streets of Nairobi, where he would get his first contacts to Rastafarians and to reggae Music. Bands like Israel Vibration, Bob Marley, Burning Spear and Culture would later have a great impact on his world view. Inspired by the spiritual background as well as the humanistic and mankind-embracing aspects of the Rasta culture Jahcoustix writes his first poems, starts playing guitar and goes in depth with the Rasta philosophy. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jahcoustix">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
