Demilich is a technical death metal band from Kuopio, Finland, that started in 1990 and initially disbanded in 1995 after their only full-length album, Nespithe, was released. The band is notable for their extremely guttural vocals and unorthodox harmonic approach to death metal. In 2014 the band released 20th Adversary of Emptiness, a compilation album featuring their entire discography remastered from the original tapes with new artwork, liner notes and previously unreleased songs.

In 2005, the band announced a brief reformation.  They did a run of shows in the United States in May/June of 2006. The band broke up after a final gig at a festival in their native Kuopio, Finland on July 22nd, 2006. Due to a long-standing promise from a member of the band, Demilich would perform again in 2010. They played a warm-up show in Kuopio on August 5th and another show on August 14th 2010 in Oulu, Finland. The band again reformed in 2014 for live shows and have continued to perform live since. In 2014 it was announced the band would be performing at 2015's Maryland Deathfest.
