Irving Adjei, known professionally as Headie One, is an English rapper from Tottenham, North London. He is best known for his track "18HUNNA" which peaked on the UK Singles Chart at number 6.

Adjei grew up on the "infamous" Broadwater Farm housing estate in Tottenham. He is of Ghanaian origin. His moniker derives from a childhood nickname due to his head's resemblance to a 50p coin. He first began rapping in his early teens, though only began focusing on it after his first release from prison.

He began releasing music in the early 2010s under the name Headz, including as part of a group named Star Gang. In 2014 he released his only mixtape under that alias, titled "Headz or Tails." Also part of Star Gang was fellow Tottenham rapper RV - he and Headie One became frequent collaborators, including co-releasing the mixtapes Sticks & Stones (2016) and Drillers x Trappers (2017). Together they formed part of OFB, a drill crew based in the Broadwater Farm estate.

In February 2018, he released his next solo mixtape as Headie One, titled The One. This included "Know Better" with RV, which became an "underground hit". In May he was featured on "Missing", a Belly Squad track that peaked at number 84 on the UK Singles Chart. This was followed by another solo mixtape, The One Two, in June 2018, which entered the UK Albums Chart at number 32.

In January 2019, his single "18HUNNA", featuring Dave, entered the UK chart at number 6 - the highest a UK drill artist has ever charted. In March he released his sixth mixtape, and third with RV, Drillers x Trappers II. It entered the UK Albums Chart at number 21. "Match Day", the first single from the mixtape, entered the Singles Chart at number 86. On 25th July 2019, Headie One released the official YouTube video for his 'Rubbery Bandz' single. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Headie+One">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
