Mercy Brown is an American metal band from Spokane, Washington. Formed in 2010, the current lineup includes Sera Hatchett (vocals), Chris Tanaka Canwell (guitar), Josh Schultz (bass), and Lunden Herndon (drums). Complimented by a vast array of influences, Mercy Brown is known for their dynamic musical presence, ranging from blackened death metal, to punk rock, to dark ambience. The diverse nature of their music has allowed them to play shows with Machine Head, Mushroomhead, 3 Inches of Blood, Castle, Hanzel und Gretyl, Lord Dying, Witch Mountain, and The Atlas Moth, to name a few. They are currently playing shows throughout the Pacific Northwest in support of their self-titled debut album.

Mercy Brown first garnered attention outside of Spokane with the release of their self-titled, three track EP in 2012. The EP eventually reached #1 on progressive rock and metal college radio stations throughout the Inland Northwest, prompting the band to begin focusing on recording and producing new material. Between 2013 and the beginning of 2015, the band focused on writing and recording new songs, while also welcoming new member Lunden Herndon, who replaced former drummer Devin Beedle in June of 2014.

On March 17th, 2015, Mercy Brown released their highly anticipated, self-titled debut album. The album was recorded and mixed at guitarist Chris Tanaka Canwell’s studio Birdhouse Squirrel in Spokane, Washington. Highlighted by the singles, ‘Red and Yellow’, ‘In the Dark’, ‘One (The Edge of)’, and ‘News Complaint’, the album has seen positive reviews and was quickly put into radio rotations across North America and Europe. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mercy+Brown">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
