There are several artists named Bypass. One of them is an old alias of Ferry Corsten, one of the others is a band from Portugal. That band is descriped below:

Bypass are a 4 piece act, formed in Lisbon, Portugal.  Formed by drummer Bruno Coelho (also in percussion), guitarist/bassist Eduardo Raon (also handles percussion, lapsteel...), guitarist Miguel Menezes (also in charge of vocals, drums, pianos and keyboards) and by bassplayer Rui Dias (also in keyboards and programming). Experimentation is the key word (voice, metalophone, whistles and a children choir are some of the examples of the "instruments" that they exploit), and trying to label them as a post-rock band is as tight as trying to put "a sumo wrestler in a phone booth". We can use rock as a starting point but the music they make can only be defined when you hear it, or better, when you are absorved and swallowed by it! Beautifully orchestrated, and very intense, and essenscially instrumental (voice is used as a common instrument) Bypass are one of the most exciting bands in the portuguese scene, and are definitely  worth checking them out. They have 2 releases, one EP (self named) and the 2006 record "Mighty Sounds Pristine", very intense and deep, full of uplifting music. Mogwai can be seen as a reference, as well as Red Sparowes or This Will Destroy You, where the common factor is quality music, great musicians, that love music and are always trying to push themselves over the limit...
