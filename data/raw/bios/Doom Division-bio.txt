After the split of their main band THE CROWNING in the summer of six mastermind Jens Reina Schiffers, "Bass Monster" Markus Fessele, "Groovemaster" Michael Geyer and Tobias Schreij√§g on vokills came together to form their new band DOOM DIVISION in Stuttgart. This band has only one reason: To rock Sludge-Doom-Stoner like its usually played in the swamps of New Orleans.
With the characteristics of abyssal downtuned strings, a heavyweight groovemachine and a literally pressed pain in voice and lyrics, similarities to CROWBAR, DOWN, BLACK SABBATH, EYEHATEGOD, SAINT VITUS, THE OBSESSED and whatnot are unmistakable. The 2007 demo can be heared on http://www.myspace.com/doomdivision.
