Hailing from Lund in southern Sweden, Veritate is a heavy metal band that incorporates elements of doom and thrash among other styles. The band was formed in 2003 by members from occult heavy metallers Cult Disciples, the more thrash-oriented Santure, and Sorthug, a pure black metal band. The singer, joining Veritate's ranks shortly afterwards, has a solid theatrical background and sports a wide vocal range, covering deep growls and high wails, as well as classic metal singing.

Although heaviness is the foundation around which the songs are built, melodies and atmosphere play a prominent role in Veritate's music. To this concoction a battery of thrashy riffs is added to compliment the keyboard elements. The result is solid metal with a doomy feel and a vibrant groove. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Veritate">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
