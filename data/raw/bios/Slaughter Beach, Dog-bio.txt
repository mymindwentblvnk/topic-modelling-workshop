Slaughter Beach, Dog is an indie rock/folk band, the brainchild of Philadelphia-based musician Jake Ewald - best known as one quarter of Modern Baseball. The other members include fellow Modern Baseball member Ian Farmer on bass, Adam Meisterhans on guitar, and Charlotte Anne Dole on drums.  As of 2022, Jake and co have recorded and released 4 full-length LP's, 2 EP's, 2 singles and an Audiotree Live Session.

Each record has represented a stylistic shift for the band with the Modern Baseball adjacent beginnings of "Welcome", to the more genre varied and less punk influenced "At The Moonbase".

On April 27th 2022 the band released their latest single, "Just Like Me", a collaboration with Anika Pyle and Dave Benton from Trace Mountains. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Slaughter+Beach,+Dog">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
