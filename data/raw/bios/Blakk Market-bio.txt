Blakk Market is a Thrash/Melodic Death Metal act hailing from Florianópolis, Brazil, active since 2002. Some of the former members of Despotic joined forces with Fernando Melleu (vocals) to get some metal deeds done.

After a 2004 demo-CD (‘Hateful Affection’) and a Brazilian Tribute to Anthrax’s cover song on their belts, the mthrfkkrs went on to their debut: ‘Self-improvement: Suicide’ saw the light of day on October 2011, featuring ten tracks that growl about being true to yourself, the end of the world, backstabbing mthrfkkrs and not giving in to the easy way out.
