Vajass was founded in the winter of 2013 by Nijur and Nud from the ashes of a previous black metal project dating back from the end of the 1990s. After two years, Ijosa and Tust joined the band. With this line up, in the Summer of 2016 Vajass recorded their first EP, "Suste Nijor", a mixture of extreme black metal, recalling old parameters but richly elaborated in terms of technique and melody [taken from the artist's  bandcamp page].  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/VAJASS">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
