Necromanther is a metal project from Oporto, Portugal formed in 2005 by Valter Abreu. It all started with the need of creating an unique sound in which he could experiment as much as possible.

On the 29th February, 2012 the debut album “Between Mankind And Extinction” was finally released.

On 2013 the project entered an hiatus and Valter stated that it will continue in the future under a new name.
