http://www.nohandpath.net/know.html = DEMO and ALBUM available for free download!

Ramin (vocals), Antonis (guitars) and Vassilis (guitars) began carving the NO HAND PATH in 2005. In 2006, with the contribution of Haris (drums) and Sotiris (Bass), both members of VARATHRON and REVOLTING BREED(RIP), a demo/EP was recorded under the title "First Farewell". After this recording, Haris and Sotiris became permanent members of the Path.

In the last days of 2010, NO HAND PATH' s debut album was released with the same line up. It is titled "An existence regained" and no label is involved in its creation. It is a concept album that deals with the "rebirth" of a person and the gradual formation of their personality. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/No+Hand+Path">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
