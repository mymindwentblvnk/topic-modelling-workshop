Polish band NEMEZIS originally started out back in 1996, at that time consisting of Wojtek Nowakowski (keyboards), Marcin Kruczek (guitar, later member of MINDFIELDS), Grzegorz Wojtasiński (bass), Lennart Sobiecki (drums) Carolina Urbańczyk (vocals). They recorded a handful of songs in the studio which were issued on a sampler, got radio airplay for one of their tunes and were busy recording their debut album when the band fell apart for various resons.

Some 12 years later Kruczek decides to get these songs issued, as well as to refresh and re-record the compositions. He assembles a new band to do so, consisting of Karolina Strużycka (vocals), Krzysztof Lepiarczyk (keyboards), Piotr Lipka (bass), Waldek Kowalski (drums, percussion) besides himself on guitar.

The final product was issued by the Lynx Music label in March 2008.


WHY IS THIS BAND LISTED AT PROGARCHIVES:

Polish outfit NEMEZIS perform an atmospheric variety of neo progressive rock, and tend to explore the less complex side of the genre. Musically there's similarities to acts like ABRAXAS and PENDRAGON, with 70's CAMEL and GENESIS as obvious influences. The band were approved for inclusion by the Neo Progressive team.
