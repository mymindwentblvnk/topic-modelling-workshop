The band started in 1998 after Peter Mulone (ex-Scavenger, ex-Wretched Sin guitarist) found a new sound he wanted to play. After a short run till summer of 2000 the original line-up broke up.

Two years passed, and, with revived members & Margaca now on drums, the band started playing. They recorded their second demo, but Margaca felt he needed to try other things while still keeping close ties to the band.

With a brand new line-up and personal changes, the band had been playing shows. A major infusion of young talent joined the band. They had added 3 new members from a local band called Overtone, and with 50 shows under their belts, their drummer, Bobby Ayotte, had left. Shortly after, the band parted ways with one of its guitarists, Brian Murphy.

While keeping busy and going through a few potential drummers for a three-year span, they finally met Robson, and have not looked back ever since.

In Harm's Way has now played over 100+ shows all over New England, and opened for well-known acts, including Paradise Lost, Pagan's Mind, Stratovarius, Epicurion, Primal Fear, Sonata Arctica, Acrassacauda, Ravage, Symphony X, & Havok.
