Dead Raven Choir began as a Polish folk/black metal duo formed in 1996 in Krak√≥w by Piotr Klima (using the name D. Smolken) and an un-named woman. The idea was to play virulent black metal with lyrics taken from "Winnie-the-Pooh". Fortunately this resulted in only one half-finished song before the mysterious woman disappeared. 

In 1998 Smolken and another mysterious woman set more A.A. Milne poems to quieter, more restrained music. DEAD RAVEN CHOIR evolved from that point, growing increasingly more raw and dramatic. In August 2004 after two CD releases and over twenty CD-Rs, Smolken abruptly ended all dead raven activity. However, old material continued to be released and reissued, including the Cask Strength Black Metal triple LP box set. 2006 brought the rebirth of DEAD RAVEN CHOIR in an even grimmer form. 

Klima moved in Texas, USA, for a while but subsequently returned to Poland.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dead+Raven+Choir">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
