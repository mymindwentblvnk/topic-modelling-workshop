Samthing Soweto is a one man band for now, he does vocals to piece his tracks together with a type of South African verses a North American Blend of folk music.

With the help of the Beat box and now with the help of Drum samples he marries the old music filled with the ever changing new age pop/alternative feel creating a new and fresh music guaranteed to be enjoyed by young and old. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Samthing+Soweto">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
