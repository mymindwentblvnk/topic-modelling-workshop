Andreas Dorau, born in Hamburg, Germany, is a singer and songwriter.

His first hit "Fred vom Jupiter", with his band Die Doraus Und Die Marinas made him popular at the age of 16.
Dorau works together with many other artists, like Justus Köhncke, Tommi Eckart (2raumwohnung), Paula, Erobique (International Pony).

His musical style is a mixture of lo-fi synth pop in combination with off-kilter, quirky, often intelligent, often hilariously naïve and self-concious storytelling lyrics, that sometimes border with novelty songs. In his vocal performance, pitch correctness and proper singing apparently is unimportant, resulting into a strange mix of lo-fi synth pop, schlager and surrealistic chansons, with unusual chord changes and infectious, catchy melodies.

His musical influences range from Der Plan to Brian Wilson, his current work is reminiscent of 60s pop, in particular the heavily textured 'wall of sound' of Phil Spector.

Due to his unique and quirky nature, Dorau enjoys a cult following. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Andreas+Dorau">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
