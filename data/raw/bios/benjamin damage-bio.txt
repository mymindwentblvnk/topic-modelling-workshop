It began with the raw energy fueled 'Maximum Carnage' mixtapes with DJ Venom, mixing up Bassline/Niche rhythms with the emerging UK Funky sound. Following this was the insanely catchy 'Deeper' for Doc Daneeka's Ten Thousand Yen label which was perhaps the true beginning of the 'Deep Rave' sound. Following the success of Deeper came the brilliantly diverse 4 track solo EP 'Antidote'. Featuring h...aunting melodies, intricate rhythms and vicious bass, the record was supported by the likes of Jackmaster, Sinden and Seb Chew and received radio play on Rinse FM and Radio 1. 'Creeper' - the first collaboration with Doc Daneeka, moved the 'Deep Rave' sound on further into the beautiful and unexplainable. Sent directly to Modeselektor on New Years Eve, it saw a huge San Francisco audience into 2011 that very night and was promptly signed the next day onto their '50 Weapons' label. An invitation to perform on the Modeselektion tour followed, which included a special show in Melt! Festival on the beautiful Meltselektor stage. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Benjamin+Damage">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
