Feigd with origin  in Vik i Sogn, Norway. Was formed in late December 2006 by Jan.
At the time Jan was playing in Sigtyr, that Odne & himself started in the early year 2002.
But he made the decision to leave the band, after four years and 3 demos behind him in Sigtyr.
Jan wanted to take a little different musical direction, so he started the one man project Feigd.
