Misterio started in 2006 as a family project between Flavio Cianciarulo (founding member, bassist and songwriter for the legendary latin fusion band Los Fabulosos Cadillacs) on guitar and vocals, and his eight year old son Astor on drums. They recorded and released “Beat Zombie” in 2006 and were later joined by Nico Valle (ex-Motorama) on standup bass. In 2008 they released their newest album, “Los Ojos del Mal”. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Misterio">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
