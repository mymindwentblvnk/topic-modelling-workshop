Formed in 2008, Gorphyryac went through multiple lineup changes and released a demo and EP before returning to the original 3 members and beginning to play a more raw and evil style of chaotic black/thrash in the vein of Sodom, Blasphemy and Bulldozer. Multiple splits are in the works in this new style as well as many upcoming live assaults in the western United States.
