First, Mugz analyzed the game; He studied it, watched it, and listened to it. Then when he turned 17…. he blew up in it. His real name is Michael Stoute, but the streets call him Mugz. Born in NDG, Montreal, Mugz first thought that he would never mess with the rap game. However, growing up around strong musical talent and influence from his older cousin, Mezziah (CEO of Hus-a-lah Entertainment), and listening to artists like Jay-Z, The Game, and Ludacris, soon persuaded him to test it out. Mezziah signed Mugz, who was only 17 at the time, to his H-Cap music label. Soon after, Mugz dropped his debut album entitled, “MUGZShot”, featuring renowned artists like Bobby Bucks, and Lady J from the H-Cap family. He’s a breath of fresh air to the industry, and a ladies man! Here’s a word of advice, don’t sleep on this dude because he’s; “M”,“U”,“G”,“Z”. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/justmuGz">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
