Katherine Bloom is an American folk singer-songwriter based in Litchfield, Connecticut. Bloom was born and raised in New Haven, CT, where she learned to play guitar among the headstones of her local cemetery. She met avant-garde guitarist Loren Mazzacane Connors in 1976 and together they recorded six limited edition albums of fragile folk and blues melodies between 1981 and 1984.
 
After her collaborations with Connors, Bloom entered a period of child-rearing and family life, returning to recording in the early 90s. By then, Bloom had begun recording again in earnest, self-releasing a series of cassettes and CD-Rs. Finally, released on Chapter Music in 2006 was her first non CD-R release since 1984.

Her recent songs reveal a singer and songwriter as accomplished and affecting as Lucinda Williams or Gillian Welch. 

Presently, Bloom trains horses and plays with her band Love at Work (which includes longtime collaborator Tom Hanford and husband Stan Bronski) offering a musical tour de force of programs for children and adults, as well as playing solo shows in the Northeastern US.
