MGA was a collaboration between Siobhan Fahey (ex Bananarama and currently Shakespears Sister) and video director Sophie Muller. The MGA Sessions (2005) is a collection of tracks that were composed to be a soundtrack for Muller  film that never materialised.  Many of these tracks were traded amongst fans via the internet before Siobhan decided to release them by way of her very own record label SF Records. Recorded between 1994-1996, the MGA Sessions was made as a limited edition run of 1000 pressings to be released in 2005. 
Musically the album draws heavily from indie rock influences and is similar in style to Fahey's work on the Shakespears Sister album #3. Contained on The MGA Sessions are two demos which appeared in their final versions on other Fahey releases: "The Older Sister" (from #3) and "Suddenly" (from Long Live the Queens!). The MGA Sessions is once again available, in digital download, with other Fahey releases at  http://www.shakespearssister.co.uk/
