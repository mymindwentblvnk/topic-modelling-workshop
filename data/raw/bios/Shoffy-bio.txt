Born and raised in Los Angeles, soulful singer-songwriter, producer and instrumentalist Shoffy champions electronic-based Pop/R&B. Writing and producing since age 14, Shoffy has jumped from different projects and bands, until embarking on his solo career.

His first wide release under the Shoffy moniker came in February 2016 with single "Takes My Body Higher" ft. Lincoln Jesser off his EP 'conversations in the a.m.' The single spread virally and reached 46 million plays (and growing) on Spotify and 25 Million video plays on YouTube. Achieving this organically without any promotion, "Take My Body Higher" also claimed a spot on the Billboard Hot Dance/Electronic Charts for 20 weeks, peaking at #19. 

Following this success, Shoffy released a seven-track EP titled 'somewhere between nostalgia and paradise’, and is in midst of releasing a string of singles (which will roll up into a larger project towards the end of the year) and playing live shows.
