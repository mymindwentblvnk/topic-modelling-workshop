From the desert of Arizona hails the Death Metal band Excessive Bleeding. Richard DiGilio (Vocals), Ryan Miller (Guitars), David DiGilio (Bass Guitars) and Zack Sewell (Drums) make up this hard hitting, relentless band from Phx, Az. E.B. started in the scene in 1994 playing with the likes of Cannibal Corpse, Morbid Angel, Monstrosity, Deicide, Suffocation, Dying Fetus, Malevolent Creation, Six Feet Under, King Diamond, Gorguts and more throughout the 90's along with getting to share the stage and one of their songs with the mighty James Murphy at their CD release show in 2000. 
E.B. put out "Spawned By Rage" in 1997 and were signed to local independent label Darque Records in '98. They recorded the "Lunatics Vision" CD in 1999. ( S.O.D. Magazine... 9 out of 10 skulls- "Forever Sleep aims at becoming the Stairway to Heaven of Death Metal !!"). 
Excessive Bleeding is back and looking forward to playing the old songs and are feverishly chomping at the bit to spill their latest music to the masses.

For contacting E.B., email at lunaticsvision@hotmail.com or excessiveones@aol.com.

***Unfortunately, after playing live for years under the Lunatics Vision banner and not too long after hanging out with him at one of their shows, their long time brother, friend and former E.B. drummer Jason Kennedy passed away from illness.*** <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Excessive+Bleeding">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
