ANTROPOFAGUS started to bleed in january 1996, but only in April 1998 they became a complete band, when Argento (vocals) and Void (bass) reached Meatgrinder (guitars) and Rigel (already drummer for the band Detestor). In 1999 Antropofagus took part with two songs to "Neurocollapse", a cd compilation featuring several bands from the whole sick planet: DEEDS OF FLESH and SEPSISM, just to mention a few.

Some months later (dec 1999) their debut album was out: "NO WASTE OF FLESH" (Beyond Productions), a title that perfectly suits their attitude and their SADO-ZOMBIE lyrics flowing from ARGENTO's perverted mind, a real SPLATTER-GORE maniac!!! Time has passed by and Antropofagus remains only a band of two components, who released in 2002 the mcd "Alive is Good...Dead is Better" (Beyond Productions), that can be considered a sort of new beginning for the band, totally hyper-blasting ans schyzophrenic sounds!!! In the meantime, the importance of that debut album "No Waste of Flesh" growed up in the years and now it is considered a sort of "cult album" for each brutal gore maniac worldwide. For this reason, after that the album was sold-out, Beyond Productions decided in 2003 to resume up that piece of totally extreme music and make a special-edition with silver graphix, bonus songs and a video-clip. The re-release was out in February 2004. (beyondprod.com/antropofagus.htm) <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Antropofagus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
