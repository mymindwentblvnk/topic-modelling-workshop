INFERNAL BEAUTY was formed in 1994.

Their first demo ('Drakensquar') which was voted 'Demo Of The Month' in the Dutch Rock mag 'Aardschock'.

The success of the demo led to a deal with Hammerheart Records and the first album would contain a remixed version of the 'Drakensquar' ('Ruler Of Darkness') demo.

Amusingly, the band's lyrics are in 'Drakensliny', a language peculiar to the band and invented by Joachim!
