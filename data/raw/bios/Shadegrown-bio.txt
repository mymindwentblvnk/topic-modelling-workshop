The project was founded in 2002 by one man from Saint-Petersburg (Russia), who appears under the name of Shadegrown. Three albums have been released over the years during which Shadegrown developed his own unique style which exists somewhere between neofolk and gothic rock. Shadegrown's albums are conceptual, each opening a different side of this style.

All music is available at high bitrate on project's official website:
