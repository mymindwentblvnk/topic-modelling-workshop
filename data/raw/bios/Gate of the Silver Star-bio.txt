A monolithic masterpiece of doomy Unorthodox Black Metal brilliantly plunging into the void. Askew and cavernous guitar riffing wails through the sulphurous halls of time, with a brilliant sense of both dissonance and form, vision and disorientation. Nostalggia's guitarwork, perfectly assembling the golden sheets of his stringed altar into this monumental work, while the ritualistic and no less virtuose drums, completely eschewing the foolishness of many of nowadays Black Metal drumming, drive the ace towards the ether. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gate+of+the+Silver+Star">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
