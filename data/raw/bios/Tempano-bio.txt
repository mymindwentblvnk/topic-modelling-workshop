Tempano is a progressive rock band from Venezuela that has been active off and on since the late 70s. They released four albums between 1979 and 1988, then went missing in action until El Fin de la Infancia in 2000 and The Agony and the Ecstasy in 2002. They combine some of the usual melodic progressive sounds with some experimental moments and unusual musical structures. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Tempano">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
