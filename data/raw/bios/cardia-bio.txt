1) New York City's Cardia reveals and invokes the romance, vastness, and lush 
aspects of pop music.  Self-recorded and self-produced, this eponymous debut resonates with a passion for song craftsmanship.  Ian Love (Rival Schools), St. John Scott IV (Shudder To Think), Andy Action (2 Skinnee J’s, Speedball Baby), and Brad Vanderark (The Verve Pipe) make up a quartet of diverse and experienced musicians moving forward into a new musical realm. Cardia seamlessly merges analog depth and studio prowess, combining textured ambient guitars with a driving rhythm section to lay the backdrop for Ian Love’s rich soaring vocals. The result is a superbly crafted and original work that demands repeated listening. (From http://www.cardiamusic.com)
