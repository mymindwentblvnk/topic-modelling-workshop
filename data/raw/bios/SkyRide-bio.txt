It was a cold December day when Chrille and his friend Jocke brodèn were drunk as hell. Chrille had recently left mandrake and wanted to start a new heavy metal band. Chrille received tip-offs from Jocke to call a good drummer with name Richard Larsson. A couple of days later Chrille made a call to Riccy (Richard Larsson) and asked him if he wanted to start a new band. He also spoke with two friends from his old band (Mandrake). That was the 2 guitar player Tobias Tångfelt and Jocke Johansson, and both of them were interested to join the new heavy metal band. So now they had 2 guitar players, the only things left was a base player. Tobias asked a guy with name Pierre Stam, and he said that he was verry interested. Right now Skyride was a completely band. It was now time to see how it worked, and everything seems to works fine. But Jocke Johansson leaves the band after the first practise. He did not have some time for a new band.

So they needed a new guitar player. A few days later Chrille and Riccy went to a party when they met Ken LaRock. Ken had recently left his band in småland and has just moved to falun. Chrille asked him if he wanted to join the band Skyride, and he was very interested. So now skyride had all members and everything worked out well.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/SkyRide">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
