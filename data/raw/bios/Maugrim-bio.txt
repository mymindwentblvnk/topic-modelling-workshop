Maugrim began in the summer of 2008.  Started somewhat as an outlet, to create fantasy ambient music that defied all others.  After the release of the first CD, the project formed more into a dark ambient project, using heavy keys, and forsaking most use of strings like on the previous release.  Two records were completed, and various demo tracks that never saw the light of day were created as well.  In the summer of 2009, a split with the well known psychedelic black metal project Njiqahdda was planned, and Maugrims half began underway.  A track clocking in at over thirty minutes was made, starting out as ambient, then transitioning into a black metal segment, and closing out with more ambience and the use of field recordings.  The split is still being planned, and will hopefully see the light of day in the near future.  At this time, another split was also planned with the legendary cult medieval ambient project Taur Nu Fuin. Ã‰lan later joined in on the project to help out with various tasks in November of 2009.  For the most part, other than a few demo songs that made their way onto myspace, Maugrim was quite silent till November 2010.  When it was decided to make a style shift and start recording depressive black metal.  Three tracks were recorded in the month of November, and are still underway to be released on the split with Taur Nu Fuin.   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Maugrim">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
