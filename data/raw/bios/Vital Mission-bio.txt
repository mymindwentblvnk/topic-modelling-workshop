Vital Mission roots started at the end of winter 2005. Three lithuanian guys, Vladas(vocals, rhythm/lead guitar), Lukas(bass guitar, back vocals) and Paulius(drums) met in London. They wanted to do something different from every day's life. The beginning was just playing sometimes with acoustic guitars on their freetime. Then it all grew up into the rock band.

Band started rehearsing their own material, time to time adding some cover songs. At first, the band was named as Wild Side. While it was called Wild Side, band had about seven gigs, which were mostly for lithuanian community in England. There were various types of concerts, starting from small lithuanian community events to the concerts of supporting lithuanian rock stars on the big open-air stages. At that moment, band members were very young and it was just a beginning.

After one year, band gained a lot of experience and a bigger passion for Rock'N'Roll. Wild Side changed their name into Vital Mission as it was more suitable name for the band, meaning that the music is their mission. Within the band name change, Vital Mission released their debut DEMO. Band started playing at English concerts such as Battle Of the Bands, etc. Recently, Vital Mission released their "Reason To Live" EP.
