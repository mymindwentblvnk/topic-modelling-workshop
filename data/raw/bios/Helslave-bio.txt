Helslave is a death metal band from Rome. The band was formed in 2009 by guitarist Jari, who soon teamed up with Daniele on vocals to play the music they both liked. The band's influences are mainly from the 90's death and melodeath Swedish scene, revisited with a personal and modern style. The live activity has never stopped during these years, peaking, in July '14, with the partecipation to the Metaldays festival in Slovenia, where they shared the stage with bands like Asphyx, Possessed, Havok, Forgotten Tombs and many others. After some lineup changes, in 2013 Helslave release their first self-product Ep “Ethereal Decay”. A few months later, they signed a deal with label Revalve Records for the release of their first full length album that is out in June 2015, entitled “An Endless Path”.
