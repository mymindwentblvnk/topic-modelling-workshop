Based in Northern Colorado, Earth Burnt Black is an amalgam of sound, never content to repeat itself. They shun the current trends and the “more-metal-than-thou” attitude associated with a lot of growing metal bands. They don’t attempt to be the darkest, the fastest or the most extreme. They don’t rely on an image, or anti-image to show who they are, instead preferring to let their music explain who they are. The easiest way to classify they is simply to call them heavy.

Earth Burnt Black is poised to leave a scar on the face of the heavy music scene with the heavy and progressive music they play, falling somewhere between the sound of Faith No More and Neurosis. Geared toward fusing the timeless songwriting of classic acts like The Who and Pink Floyd with the brutal realities of Pantera or Mastodon, they appeal to intelligent listeners and fans of bands akin to Isis, Cynic, Unsane, Baroness, Kylesa, Alice in Chains, Clutch, Tool, etc. They will never follow a trend or try to write a song solely based on what is popular. Having just released Harrowing Catharsis, a full length debut album, 8 tracks woven together and following a singular concept, clocking at over 54 minutes, Earth Burnt Black shuns convention and disposable music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Earth+Burnt+Black">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
