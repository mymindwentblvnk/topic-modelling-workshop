Multiple artists are known as Metropolis.

1. An AOR band from Canada by Stan Meissner and Peter Fredette. They released the album "Power of the night" in 1999.

2. A short-lived progressive rock band from Berlin - 1973 initiated by Michael Duwe who has been an early member of AGITATION FREE and produced "Seven UP" with ASH RA TEMPEL. Other members to have former collaborations with wellknown bands were drummer Thomas Hildebrand (MYTHOS) and Michael Westphal (ASH RA TEMPEL).

Their eponymous debut was recorded December 1973 in Munich. Very rare as vinyl and in the early 90s also released by the Germanofon label as an unauthorized bootleg on CD. A concept album with clear musical influences because 'Mickie' Duwe also participated at the Berlin "Hair" performance. So there is a special vocal emphasis (Duwe's voice was close to Bowie) combined with a blend of several styles like Symphonic, Folk, Blues, Jazz- and Krautrock, very innovative and unique at that time.

Afterwards METROPOLIS disbanded and all musicians went to other bands or worked solo.

3. A Nu-Metal band from Nitra, Slovakia. Formed in 2002 they play hard rock / nu metal music. They combine various features from diffrent genres and do not wish to be labelled by some specific music style. The name of the group was inspired by a cult German movie Metropolis. They have already released two albums Radioactivity (2005) and Vodoo (2007). They are working on the third album. It is expected to be released in spring 2009.;
