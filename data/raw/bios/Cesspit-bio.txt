More than one artist is called Cesspit:

1. French Death/Thrash/Grind band in the vein of Gronibard, Cannibal corpse.... Their music is the usual death/thrash stuff but what makes the band really stands out is the lyrical content which is overall utterly insane. Most of the lyrics (in French and English) revolve around sexually oriented subjects but some are more committed and deal with dictatorship and oppression for instance. 

2. An Instrumental Rock band. They released a demo in 2003.

3. "Not the average SKA band in sunny Singapore. Rest assured!" <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cesspit">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
