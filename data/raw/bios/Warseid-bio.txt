Warseid began in the winter of 2008 writing a vast array of music, developing and polishing their take on blackened folk metal. They quickly became a favorite in the Madison metal scene for their unique sound and excellent live performances, soon travelling around the Midwest.

At the start of 2012, Warseid began production of their most recent release, Where Fate Lies Unbound, with sound engineer Cory Scheider (Luna Mortis, Epicurean, Casket Robbery). It was their most dynamic release to date; exploring longer compositional structures, more developed chord progressions, and more intricate harmony. The 4-track EP, Where Fate Lies Unbound, was extremely well received by the metal critic and fan alike.

With several tours under their belt, Warseid has become a much noted name in the Midwest metal scene. Finally, after a five year honing process, Warseid has begun production on their first full-length album that takes the sound of Where Fate Lies Unbound and pushes it further. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Warseid">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
