Thrash Metal from Milwaukee, WI U.S.A.
myspace.com/hammeredmetal

HAMMERED is a thrash metal band based out of Milwaukee, WI. Instead of playing what the trend is these days with thrash metal, HAMMERED has a style similar to no other band. With lots of harmonies, and plenty of speed, mixed with a good party and some booze, their attitudes do not sway from making quality metal, and having a good time doing it. HAMMERED has recently released their debut full length record entitled "Gut Rot" at Howl Street Studios in Milwaukee. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hammered">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
