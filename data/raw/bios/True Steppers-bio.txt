The Truesteppers were a British UK garage production duo consisting of Jonny Lisners and Andy Lysandrou.

They had success with Dane Bowers on Buggin, which reached #6 in the UK Charts in April 2000.

Their biggest selling record came in August 2000 when Truesteppers collaborated with Dane Bowers and Victoria Beckham on Out of Your Mind. There was a huge wave of publicity for this single and Victoria involved her husband, David Beckham, for the mass in-store record signings. There was a massive chart battle with Spiller and Sophie Ellis-Bextor , whose summer dance track Groovejet (If This Ain't Love) was released in the same week. Truesteppers were leading in midweek, but Spiller had overtaken them by Saturday. Spiller was announced as #1 on the Sunday, with Truesteppers at #2. They later released a single with ex-East 17  singer Brian Harvey  and Donell Jones  called True Step Tonight which reached #25, and an album named Truestepping, which failed to chart according to www.everyhit.com <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/True+Steppers">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
