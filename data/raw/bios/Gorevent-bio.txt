Gorevent is a slam death metal band from Japan. They formed in 2004 and with a couple recent changes their current line up is Takashi (Vocals), Kasahara-Brutal -(Guitars), Gokucho  (Guitars, Rest in Gore) Hisashi (Bass) and Moriyama (Drums, Testicles Virus). The band is similar to Devourment and Abominable Putridity.

They released their first full length "Abnormal Exaggeration" by Macabre Mementos in 2008, after their highly rated slamming brutal death effot demo in 2007. The band recieved all round good reviews, however, one criticism was that ran through was the lack of imagination as the album was dubbed a "total Devourment rip off" and so fourth.

The band, not deterrent of these reviews, went on to perform tours and finally to release a split with Embryonic Depravity on Sevared Records in 2009. This created enough openess for the band to push forward with their songwriting into the new year.

When the end the result became known as "Worship Paganism" released in early 2010 under Macabre Mementos. The band has got balanced reviews by magazines and fans alike.
