There are two artists/groups named Insula.
1. Belarussian melodic alternative band.

2. Insula is the pseudonym of George Kaplan, an electronica and classical musician. Kaplan was born in Monroe City, Indiana in 1986. In 1991, his family moved to Port Chester, NY, where his father, David "C-Beat" Kaplan was involved in the flourishing rave scene. Having been trained classically and technologically by his father, George started composing music in his early teens. His first album, the independently released "Orient" (2005) became an indie phenomenon and an underground hit, although only 1000 copies of the album were actually made. The album is notable for its mix of orchestral compositions and electronic interludes. Insula now resides in Washington, DC, where he is working on his next project, the Triduum EP. Kaplan has made two of the tracks (still works in progress) available on this page for free download before the EP is released in February 2008. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Insula">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
