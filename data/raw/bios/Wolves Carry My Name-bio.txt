Wolves Carry My Name is a five-piece Sludge band from Siegen, Germany. Born in late 2011, this profane cult intends to set the world's decline to music by arranging furious, heart bending and manifold soundscapes somewhere between brokenness, abomination and anger. The headstrong sound combines heavy Sludge/Stoner riffing with Ambient/Post-Rock elements, a slight Psychedelic/Blues touch and both desperate and hate driven vocals.
