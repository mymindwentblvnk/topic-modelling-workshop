Daye Jack is 18 years old, from Atlanta, and currently enrolled at NYU. He was a talented soccer player who left Atlanta and soccer behind to make music and study computer science, and this music thing has been working out well. His sound is a blend of hip-hop and soul with a modern twist that lives comfortably in a world somewhere between alternative R&B and experimental rap.

He’ll get labeled as a rapper because he raps, but Daye Jack is capable of an array of interesting styles. Whether jazzy and laid back like “Lonely Girl,” more aggressive like “Weeping Willow,” or experimental and electronic like “Save My Soul,” there’s a crisp intensity and flourishes of melody to everything Daye Jack creates. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Daye+Jack">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
