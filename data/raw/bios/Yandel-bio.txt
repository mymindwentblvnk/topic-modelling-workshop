Yandel is half of the superstar reggaeton duo Wisin & Yandel, who enjoyed mainstream breakthrough success with Pa'l Mundo (2005). Born Llandel Veguilla Malav√© on January 14, 1977, in Cayey, Puerto Rico, he and Wisin began performing as a duo in the late '90s (Yandel then billing himself as "Llandel") and made their album debut in 2000 with Los Reyes del Nuevo Milenio. They later made the jump to a major label in 2003 with Mi Vida... My Life, their first for Universal subsidiary Machete Music. Pa'l Mundo then catapulted them to mainstream success in 2005. Subsequently, Wisin & Yandel established their own label, WY Records, and presented an affiliate group, Los Vaqueros. ~ Jason Birchmeier, All Music Guide <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Yandel">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
