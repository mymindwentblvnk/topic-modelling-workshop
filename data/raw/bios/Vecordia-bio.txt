Here it comes the folk metal done in a Polish way. Female vocals, violins, flutes and metal corpse will make you eager to come back into your roots. Vecordia is melodic metal in which you will find overwhelming speeds , smashing beat, catchy motifs and ballad spirit. Vecordia is a new quality metal. The band derives all the best from ethnic music and draws boundaries of the folk avant-guarde.
