Traumwelt is a solo project from Atlanta run by Kythirius. The idea is to help listeners reach altered states of consciousness through spacy soundscapes. Promary influences include Maurizio Bianchi and The Angelic Process. Kythirius released the first demo in 2012, and it can be found on Spotify and iTunes.
