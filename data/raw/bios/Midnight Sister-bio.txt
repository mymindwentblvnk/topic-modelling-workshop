Juliana Giraffe and Ari Balouzian make art pop with a cinematic flair as Midnight Sister. The duo emerged with their full-length debut, Saturn Over Sunset, in 2017.

Both natives of the San Fernando Valley and graduates of the same high school a few years apart, they met when Balouzian, a classically trained musician, wrote the score for a short film scripted by Giraffe and her sister, a friend of Balouzian's. When he followed up by sending some instrumental music to Giraffe, and she returned it with vocals, they liked the results and decided to keep working together. Midnight Sister was Balouzian's first pop project aside from doing arrangements for Tobias Jesso, Jr. and Alex Izenberg, and Giraffe's first musical endeavor. With an off-kilter, retrofuturist demeanor, their debut album was inspired by the local characters and mythology of L.A. Titled Saturn Over Sunset, it arrived on the Jagjaguwar label in 2017. The likewise offbeat follow-up, 2021's Painting the Roses, was partly inspired by a trip Giraffe took to visit family in Argentina.
