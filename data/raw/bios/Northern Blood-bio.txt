The band Northern Blood was created in a small town called Pinneberg at the end of 2005.Sarah (git.) joined Philipp (voc.),Stephan (git.) and Tobi (drums) right after that.After one month searching for someone that can play bass they finally found Lukas.Before Lukas joined the band there was another one that played bass,but he left the band because of personal reasons.Finally a young and motivated band started its career.Unfortunately Lukas had to leave the band after one year full of relatively successful shows in vicinity of Pinneberg/Hamburg.But that had no influence on the music that the band used to play and they`re looking as fast as possible for a good replacement. Northern Blood plays a combination of black metal drum parts and fat thrash metal guitar playing.In addition to it comes a dark and clean bass line that is improved by high screamings.That`s the typical and distinctive sound of Northern Blood.There is absolutely no political influence in the sound of Northern Blood.And the philosophy of Northern Blood has also absolutely nothing to do with that new wave of right-wing extremism in the black metal genre. The lyrics are about the cold north of Scandinavia and old sagas of vikings.Also antichristian influences are a part of the black/thrash metal of Northern Blood. thx Mel <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Northern+Blood">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
