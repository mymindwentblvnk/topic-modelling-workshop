SMF, short for Sick Mother Fakers (aka Sick Mother Fuckers), is a hardcore punk band formed in February 1989, in Belgrade, Serbia. The band mixes late eighties crossover thrash into a more modern form and is influenced by many different genres. Most of SMF's songs have sarcastic and absurd themes. The band, as well as their fans claim their music as the subgenre of hardcore called "Sickcore". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/S.M.F.">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
