Bio:
A 3-piece sludge attire hailing from Croatia.Formed in 2006. originally a death metal band, through the years they went through different sounds but mostly focusing on dark atmosphere of doom metal, gluing layers of dissonant harmonies, samples, percussion, and sludgy riffs which cement song structures.
Their progress in experimentation can be felt through three EP-s, Marrow 2010., Left for the Wolves 2012. and Atum 2013.
In 2018. they released their 6 song LP "Serpentide" through Cimmerian Shade Recordings.
The themes in songs are centered on; isolation and angst (Marrow), the occult and heresy(Left for the Wolves), cataclysmic omens and purge of humanity (Atum).
They cite Melvins, Godlesh, Swans, Neurosis, Ramesses, Isis, Cathedral, Grief and Crowbar as main influences. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Duskburn">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
