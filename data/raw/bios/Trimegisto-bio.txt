Trimegisto is brutal, dark and sinister death metal band in the vein of Incantation, Immolation or Melektaus. It was formed in 2000 in the underground metal scene of Santiago playing frequently at bars between 2003 and 2004 and promoting their demo "Chaos Contemplation". This band, that in the beginning started with members from various bands, finally takes place with many integrants. They have shared stage with such acts as Cannibal Corpse (in 2004). They finally settled on their actual and official current line-up in 2007.
