Sherm is from a small town in North Idaho called Sandpoint. Taking in the yearly Jazz festival and the earthy roots, he creates rhymes and verses on tracks that most could not. With a combination of intensity and casualness Sherm creates sceneries and mental images in an unbelievable fashion. Born in 94' he knows what 90's kids like, from rugrats to DMX. He started making music not to long ago and  was lucky enough to go on tour with big names such as G-eazy, Iamsu, and so on.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sherm">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
