Clear Sky Nailstorm is a Thrash Metal band from Bremen (Germany).

Begun with the motivation to play old school thrash Ã  la Exodus, Testament or Overkill with a touch of death metal, they quickly started to integrate touches of other styles like metalcore and melodic speed metal  as well.

Clear Sky Nailstorm were formed in 2008 by Thomas (rhythm guitar, vocals) and Oliver (drums) after having played together in various other bands for years. After years of lineup issues they were completed by Jojo  on guitar and Alex on bass.

After having home-recorded a 5-track EP, entitled "Marching Through Darkness", released in Spring 2012, they released their first self-titled studio album "Clear Sky Nailstorm"(featuring former bassist Martin) in 2014. Their second, more technical album "The Inner Abyss" (featuring Tobias  on lead guitar and Dennis  on bass) was released in 2016 on BretHard Records. Their latest album The Deep Dark Black was released in April 2020 on Kernkraftritter Records.
