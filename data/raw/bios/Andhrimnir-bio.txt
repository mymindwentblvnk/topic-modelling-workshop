Andhrimnir began in 1998 as a one-man bedroom project in Birmingham, England. Influenced by the early 90s Norwegian black metal scene, Andhrimnir took his name from one of the Norse Gods and released music exclusively through the now-defunct mp3.com system.

The "Winter Blasphemies" EP in 1999 contained the song "...And The Forest Screams Blasphemy" which hit #1 in the mp3.com Black Metal charts and remained there for 7 weeks. This EP was followed by a compilation, "Celestial Silver and Pagan Might", which collected early demo recordings of varying quality. The final song on the album, "Rusting Celestial Silver" showed the direction in which Andhrimnir was heading.

After the addition of Sahrimnir on guitar, the Andhrimnir sound was truly forged. Combining an old school thrash influence (Celtic Frost, Destruction) with the melodic sensibility of Gothenburg-style death (At The Gates), a black metal attitude (Darkthrone, Marduk) and a hardcore/punk sensibility (Black Flag), the resulting sound was lethal and was captured in full on the 2000 independently released EP "Five Fingers of Loki".

"Five Fingers of Loki" saw the new two-piece band gain popularity through publicity online and in KERRANG! magazine (who dubbed Andhrimnir "wilder than Marduk!"). This prompted them to enlist musicians for a full live line-up.

A five-piece incarnation of Andhrimnir (Andhrimnir - vocals, Sahrimnir - guitar, Lifthrasir - bass, Necro Clit Bashir - guitar, Uitigs - drums) existed in 2001 but soon split. It could be argued that the intensity of the music they were playing was what blew them apart. None of the personnel involved were ever heard from again but sometimes the winter wolves are heard to howl the infernal melodies of Andhrimnir's music, high above the icy mountains of Carpathia. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Andhrimnir">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
