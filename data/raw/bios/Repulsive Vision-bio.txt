Repulsive Vision are a four piece old school death metal band from Barrow in Furness, Cumbria. 

Formed in late 2010 by main songwriter, Matt Davidson, the band are heavily inspired by extreme metal pioneers such as Obituary, Death, Carcass and Napalm Death, affecting a relentlessly aggressive sound that is prominent in this subgenre. 

Following the release of their debut album (“Look Past The Gore and See The Art”, Mighty Music) in 2017, the band have been prominently active on the underground extreme metal circuit performing all over mainland Europe and the United States (including performances at the following festivals: Hammerfest, Vagos Metal Fest, The Siege of Limerick, Las Vegas Death Fest, Goathell Metal Festival, etc), receiving positive reviews in several worldwide publications, garnering over 68k plays on Spotify and gathering a global fanbase.

In 2020, the band released their sophomore album, NECROVICTOLOGY on Emanzipation Productions. Once again, composed and compiled by Matt Davidson (Guitars), Dan McEwan (Vocals), Mark Kirby (Bass) and Gary Young (Drums), Necrovictology builds upon the punk fueled foundations of the debut, progressing their material both sonically and musically, advancing in speed, clarity and technicality.
