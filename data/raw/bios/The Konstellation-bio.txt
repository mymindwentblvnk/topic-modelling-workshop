The Konstellation was formed in Dunakeszi, Hungary at the beginning of 2009 - with the goal of propagandize the will of the universe. Musically, it includes elements of sounds of the space and marks of the humanity as well. The sharp oppositions of melodic aggression and melancholy fight each other in this huge galaxy, even though they characterize the bandâ€™s individuality by creating a whole. The lyrical conception is about the complexity, simplicity and mediocrity of human life, which is profound like a vortex at the same time, written in an abstract, philosophic form.
