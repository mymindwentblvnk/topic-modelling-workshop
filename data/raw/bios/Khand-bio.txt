Khand are a cosmic ambient project from Boston, Massachusetts, USA. 

Started in 1998 with the aim of fusing ambient, keyboard and neoclassical aesthetics, Khand takes in influences from the ancient world, space and epic fantasy literature, creating lush sonic reveries that invite the listener to imagine lonely distant worlds far off and long lost.
