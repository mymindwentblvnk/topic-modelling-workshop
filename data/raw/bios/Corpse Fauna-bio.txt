Formed in 2010, Corpse Fauna are a extreme death metal/death grind band rupturing eardrums around Essex (UK). Tuning so low, it's guaranteed to leave you with rectal prolapse. Combine that with technical death metal guitar, insane drums and riffs that have been known to cause abortions.

Strong influences from black metal and death metal, with an increasing amount of grind.
