Aggro Berlin is an independent German hip-hop record label featuring four artists; Sido, B-Tight, Tony D and Fler. The label is known mostly for its controversial lyrics and themes. The four artists have been criticized for the attitude of their songs towards women and gay people. Songs that have been singled out include "Neger bums mich" (Negro, fuck me), "Arschficksong" (Assfucksong) and "Aggro".
