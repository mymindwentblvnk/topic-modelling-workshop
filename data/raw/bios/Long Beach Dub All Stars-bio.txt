The 1996 heroin overdose of Sublime frontman Brad Nowell left bassist Eric Wilson and drummer Bud Gaugh of the third wave ska revival band without their lead man (and Lou Dog without his master, Brad).
The two musicians formed the Long Beach Dub Allstars with Opie Ortiz (the artist who created most of Sublime's tattoos and several of their album covers)on vocals, guitarist RAS-1 and Miguel, saxophonists Todd Foreman and Tim Wu, Jack Maness and Isaiah Owens on keyboards, and finally DJ Marshall Goodman.
After releasing some singles and compilations, they released their debute album "Right Back" on DreamWorks in 1999.  In 2001 they released "Wonders of the World" once again on DreamWorks.
Long Beach Shortbus was formed after the Long Beach Dub Allstars disbanded in 2003  by the two founding members from Long Beach Dub Allstars Eric Wilson and RAS-1. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Long+Beach+Dub+All+Stars">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
