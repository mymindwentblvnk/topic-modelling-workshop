Founded in 2000 by Miikka Kuisma in Kouvola, Finland, New Dawn Foundation is a finnish metal band with some gothic influences.They have already gotten outstanding reviews in finnish and german music-magazines ("So Damn Lost Again" 2001/2002: demo of the month Hammer 10/10, Inferno 10/10, Oblivion 8/10 etc). After several concerts in Finland's clubs and festivals, their debut was quickly sold out. After the good start, things got slower, mostly because of not so active feeling in the band. In year 2003 came one quickly made demo "Demonosonic Landscape". Some line-up changes to get band work as good as it can. Record deal in the first half of year 2005. Now they are done with their first album "Moment of Clarity". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/New+Dawn+Foundation">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
