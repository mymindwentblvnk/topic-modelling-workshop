In the winter of 2006 two men had a vision; to create a sound like no other. This vision lead to the creation of a sound based on their unique mix of influences, talent and passion. Together, the rhythmic assault of drummer Johnny Macri and shredding massacre of guitarist John Murphy gave birth to a new breed of metal: THE UNBORN DEAD.

In 2008 the Toronto metal scene was shaken upon the release of the initial EP THE UNBORN DEAD. This EP, the new prototype for sheer brutality, technicality and aggression can be heard above with official copies available in the near future. Unmatched Brutal Death Metal has a new name: THE UNBORN DEAD and it is here to stay.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Unborn+Dead">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
