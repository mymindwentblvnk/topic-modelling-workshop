Get ready to embark upon an adventure of epic proportions! Hailed as champions of the “New Wave of British Power Metal”, Sorcerer’s Spell are set to enchant audiences everywhere with a unique and diverse mix of musical influences combined with a passion for high fantasy and grand narrative concepts.

The six-piece’s latest incarnation formed in late 2011 with the addition of singer, Mitchel Emms, who completed the line-up of Paul Templing and Andy Whittle on guitars, Amy Turk on keys, David Stanton on bass and Ben Turk on drums. In April 2012, they released their debut commercial release, the three-track EP “Skeleton Throne”.

The band originated in 2006, when founding member Paul Templing began recruiting members for a new project designed to stand out as unique and vibrant in amongst a largely tired and stagnated underground metal scene. During the band’s formative years they did just that, making an impact on local venues and quickly gaining notoriety as an exciting live spectacle. The band rose through the ranks to support such acts as Alestorm, Power Quest and Rise to Remain, culminating in an appearance at the UK’s premier metal festival, Bloodstock Open Air.

Now Sorcerer’s Spell are back, delivering their unique brand of metal with more power and vigour than ever! Prepare to be left awestruck as they unleash their wizardly waves of spellbinding sound at a venue near you! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sorcerer%27s+Spell">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
