Formed in 2010, in London, England, Träumen is the solo Raw Black Metal project of Lich. Träumen is German for the word "dreaming", a theme integral to the project's music and lyrical output. Dreams are the mind's method of escapism, a neccessary respite from the terrible burden of absolute consciousness. Träumen 's music is much the same, inspired by the vast sorrow that exists within all humans, that unexpressed, unquenched desire to shed the burden of self awareness, to return to a simpler, more primal age - to exist, once more, within the natural order of the universe.
