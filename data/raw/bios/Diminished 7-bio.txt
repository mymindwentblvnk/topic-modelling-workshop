DIMINISHED 7 was created during 2007 in Los Angeles by Alex Crescioni. After two years of tentative writing and pre-production, the first album “Dim World” was thriving to bloom. The album was produced in August 2009 at Shrine Recording in Valencia, California where Crescioni took on recording, mixing, and producing of the record. The albums release, on November 10th 2009 unexpectedly generated considerable hype and much deliberation throughout the gothic rock and metal scene. “Dim World” embraces songs presenting a blend of solid 7 string guitar riffs, melancholic synths, and unforgettable vocal melodies. Its atmosphere is orchestrated to the dance of a burning rose.

After over a year of searching for the right members, a full band was finally formed in 2011.  Opening for dark rock act DOMMIN, DIMINISHED 7 played their first show at Slidebar in Fullerton California June 30th 2011, which was a huge success.  They continued to play gigs throughout the year at hit venues in Hollywood, including the House Of Blues, The Viper Room, and Boardner's.  DIMINISHED 7 plan on releasing a full length acoustic album entitled "Hollow Haven" which will be released late October 2012.  A music video was shot for the single "Queen In Nuclear Rain" which will be featured on the album, among others. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Diminished+7">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
