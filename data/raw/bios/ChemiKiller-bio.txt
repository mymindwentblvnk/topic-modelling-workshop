The 1980's was an amazing time for Extreme Metal. It was a decade that gave birth to some of the names that now command nothing less than respect: Venom. Bathory. Celtic Frost. Possessed. Slayer. Sodom. The Mentors. Motorhead. Destruction. Anthrax. Carnivore. Mercyful Fate. Metallica. Exodus. Kreator. The list could go on almost indefinitely. It was an era when the new genres of Thrash and Black Metal were evolving into a force that would withstand the test of time. It was a collection of sounds, styles and attitudes that would pave the way for Metal bands for years, even decades to come. Ramrod of Chemikiller is a disciple of this glorious era and has made extreme music in many forms since the late 80's. Ramrod's first extreme undertaking was a Motorhead & Venom inspired power trio called Defcon. The band only lasted a few months and recorded 1 demo and 1 live recording. But the seed that was planted took root and grew for almost 2 decades. After various projects over the years, Chemikiller remains. Chemikiller is making music today because it has to. Because the heavy, powerful music that was born in the 80's was corrupted in the 90's, when the music too often took second place to cheap Kiss-like makeup, unlistenable non-musicians using minimal lo-fi technology, cheap horror film schlock, and nauseating kiddy-Nazism. Ramrod's creation, Chemikiller resurrects the classic thrash sounds of the 80's. A time when Metal was pure and true. If you also long for the glory days, please listen to the music. Sure, there is some new 21st century technology, but the message is in the music again.

In 2006, RAMROD welcomes LOKI into the Chemikiller fold to continue making its own brand of Black Thrashing insanity.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Chemikiller">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
