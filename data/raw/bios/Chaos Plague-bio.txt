The band was born in 2006, created by Matteo, who used to live in Liguria and his friend Luca, our first vocalist, who lived in Lombardia. When Matteo moved to Mozzate(CO), he continued this ambitious project together with Stefano and Davide. After various difficulties, in 2009 the line-up was completed by Simone as solo guitar and Francesco as voice.

In 2013 Simone and Francesco left the band and their place were took by Luciano Duca and Daniele Belotti.
Chaos Plague's goal is to fuse '90s Death Metal together with extreme modern Metal. The band is also inspired by some jazz elements.

For all fans of: Obscura, Pestilence, Cynic.
