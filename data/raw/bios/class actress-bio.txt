Class Actress is a synthpop band formed in 2009 in Brooklyn, New York City, USA. The group consists of the singer-songwriter Elizabeth Harper and the producers Scott Rosenthal and Mark Richardson. Their music has been compared with artists like Depeche Mode, The Human League, OMD and Madonna.

Elizabeth Harper is a former drama student from Los Angeles, USA. Harper also pursued a solo career as an indie rock singer-songwriter. She released a studio album Elizabeth Harper in 2004 (2005 in the UK and 2006 in Japan). After the producer Mark Richardson remixed a song, she preferred Richardson’s version to the original, and the two eventually reconvened in Brooklyn. They began fusing Harper’ songs with sampled drumbeats and synthesized instruments and named the collaboration Class Actress. Later, multi-instrumentalist/engineer Scott Rosenthal joined the group.

In 2010, Class Actress released the 5-track EP Journal of Ardency on Chris Taylor’s (of Grizzly Bear) Terrible Records. 

In October 2011, the band released the debut album Rapprocher (meaning "to come closer" in French) on Carpark Records. The album received many positive reviews. The single "Weekend" supported the album.
