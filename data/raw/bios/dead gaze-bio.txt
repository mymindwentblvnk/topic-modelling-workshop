R. Cole Furlow fronts Dead Gaze, a skuzzy but very poppy lo-fi band out of Oxford, Mississippi. In 2010, after Dead Gaze's first cassette release, End of Days, Why Not You on Mirror Universe, the group released a split with Gray Things on Clan Destine. The same year, they also released a two-song 7‚Äù single on Fire Talk Records, which found them moving from their early Flaming Lips sound in a chillwave direction with drum machines and synthesizers. ~ Jason Lymangrover, Rovi
