Line up: Ptr (everything, including back vocals), Ptra (vocals).

Soul Extinction started in the summer of 2008.
Ptr had a few ideas about new dark music.
He asked Ptra to do the voice on one song (Lost).
The result was amazing.
They recorded two more songs and uploaded them to MySpace.
The response was massive.
Soul Extinction has now recorded 8 songs.

At the moment Ptr is writing new music.
Soul Extinction prepare to go live in August or September 2009. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Soul+Extinction">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
