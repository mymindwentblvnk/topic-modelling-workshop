Angband is a Power Metal/ progressive band from Iran. formed in 2004 in Tehran by Mahyar Dean a classically trained musician and author who is well known in metal world for writing two books about Death  and Testament  bands, specifically for his Death book in 2000 when Chuck Schuldiner  (R.I.P) was still among us, “…the work and devotion you (Mahyar) have put toward this book is a true testament of your belief in the music as I am a fan of heavy metal as well.” Chuck wrote to Mahyar in a letter.

Angband was a Progressive metal/ Instrumental project first but when Mahyar met a talented tenor singer Ashkan Yazdani they decided to become a Power Metal/ thrash/ Progressive band with killer vocals! Then Ramin Rahimi joined the band, he plays killer drums and most of Persian and Eastern percussions!
