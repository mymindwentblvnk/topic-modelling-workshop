In lands with ancestral history, Morgarten was created in 2005, in the region of Neuchatel in Switzerland. The five brave warriors being part of Morgarten stood up to bring the world to their cause, starting immediately to compose, giving birth to their first songs. At the end of 2006, they considered that their weapons were ready enough to step out of their cave and received good feedback, after several gigs. Using the theme of medieval times, their metal has been described as "both melodic and warlike, transporting you into the middle of a forest at the time of knights" (Eternel.ch). Several gigs were performed, bringing them up to Uster (ZH) or St- Maurice (VS). They could play besides bands like: War of Ages, Deuterononium, Seventh Avenue, Co√Øt, etc. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Morgarten">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
