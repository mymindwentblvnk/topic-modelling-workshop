Voltumna, hailing from central Italy, was forged in 2009 by Michele Valentini on guitars, drummer Bruno Forzini and Manuel Bannella on bass, later joined by vocalist Simone Scocchera. Their mix of old school Death and Black Metal proved to set the right soundtrack for their lyrical themes, inspired by the myths and history of the etruscan civilization. 

Voltumna released their first effort "Chimera" in 2011, recorded at Fear No One Studio (owned by Emiliano Natali), consisting of 4 tracks that strikingly introduced them into the italian extreme metal scene. Voltumna subsequently intensified their live activity in Italy, while working on the songwriting of their upcoming full lenght.

In summer 2012, the band enters Fear No One Studios again, teaming up with Paolo Pieri (Hour of Penance, Aborym) as music producer, to record their new effort called “Damnatio Sacrorum”, consisting of 10 song of old school brutality.
