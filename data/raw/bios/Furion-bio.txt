There are 2 bands with this name:

1) Furion was formed in 2006. Coming from Skopje, Macedonia, the Macedonian folklore had great influence over their music. Their music is a blend of Macedonian folklore guitar scales and melodies with intense and full of energy progressive thrash metal drumming. In their existence, they have played several of the major cities in Macedonia and also won the WOA Metal Battle of Former Yugoslav Republics contest for playing on Wacken 2009. They played on Wacken 2009 on the W:E:T Stage.
They are currently recording their first album.

2) Furion are a 5 piece band that hail from Mikkeli, Finland...
Set deep in the lake district of a large
northern european country, where the land is flat and
populated with moose, bears and yet more lakes...
Furion pioneer a sound that is more rock than metal, 
still hard edged, with a sensitivity and balance born of a
connectivity with self, others, land and beast.
