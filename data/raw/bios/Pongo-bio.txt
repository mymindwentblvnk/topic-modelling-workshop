Born in 1992, Pongo (formerly known as Pongo Love) became one of the voices of Kuduro. She was born in Angola but grew up in the outskirts of Lisbon when she got the attention of Buraka Som Sistema (BSS) crew. In 2008, I had the opportunity to see her debut with BSS in a wild night to showcase the album Black Diamond. Pongo was the voice behind the hit single “Kalemba (Wegue Wegue)”. A track so hot that had likes from Diplo, Hot Chip and even Shakira praising it.

After 10 million views and 10 years, Pongo is ready to take over the world. Again. But don’t think she was hiding in the last few years. She didn’t stopped recording. She went into the studio with artists such as Quantic, Pupilos do Kuduro, Massivedrum, PEDRO or Karetus. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pongo">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
