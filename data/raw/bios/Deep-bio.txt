1.) Deep is an ambient, drone, experimental Indie music duo, formed in Augsburg, Germany in 1993. Bandmembers since then are Stefan Vetter and Bernd Spring. Stefan played in german HC Punk legend Inferno and Bernd in Grindcore Combo Ulcerous Phlegm, before they formed Deep. Both playing Bass. In the early Deep days, they sound very distorted and moved to a lighter more melodic style with drum maschines, synths, toy-instruments and voice. In 2004 they throw away the additional stuff and playing just earthquaking feedbacks with their basses, amps and FX. Currently they redefine themselfs and merging the melodic ambient sound from former days, with the more harsh feedbacks.
Bernd Spring is also running the Dhyana Records label, which released a wide spectrum of experimental sounds with experimental packages. From 8-bit breakcore stuff over experimental, ambient drone sounds to singer-songwriter stuff.
