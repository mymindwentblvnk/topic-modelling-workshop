A free trade album that was spread largely across the internet through P2P networks and word of mouth.

Aether by Pyrex is a fusion of organic and electronic tone with a clear message to the people...It is time to rise above the concepts and lines that our leaders and governments have drawn throughout history...The music was an 8 month project, compiling many styles including; funk, jazz, electronica, Turntablism, and Hip hop.The voices featured on the album are audio cuts from great men such as; Martin Luther King, Howard Zinn, Bill Hicks, Hunter s. Thomson, David Icke, Peter Linderman and many others.This is and was always intended to be a Free Project.
