Shabaka Hutchings is one of the most eclectic and musically adventurous instrumentalists on the London jazz scene. He is motivated by the aesthetics governing musical styles (especially jazz and contemporary classical music) and how these relate to improvisation, the treatment and movement of sound, and the essential purpose or meanings behind the will to create. Hutchings' conceptualisation of the creative process has made him equally at home performing a broad array of styles whilst retaining a unique voice within them.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Shabaka+Hutchings">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
