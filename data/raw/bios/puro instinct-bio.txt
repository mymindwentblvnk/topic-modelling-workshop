Founding Puro Instinct (formerly Pearl Harbor) members Piper and Skylar Kaplan began playing together in the summer of '08 with no experience and no idea what they were getting themselves into. After a year or so, they put together a proper band (Dodi Porter, Jessie Clavin, Mike Baum, and Crazy Murray) to begin crafting their ethereal pop confections. Armed with a barrage of gorgeously intertwining guitar lines, vocals drenched in swooning reverb, and a subtle tsunami of dark synth melodies.
