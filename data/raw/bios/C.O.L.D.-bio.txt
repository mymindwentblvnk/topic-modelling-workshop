Children Of the Last Days are Pythagoras The Preying Mantis, Dark Water Quartz and Lorna Harris, Invented for the entertainment and (spiritual) education of the inmates at Brinsford Young Offenders Institution through Prison Link ministry in 1999. Formed officially in 2000 with the intention of reaching further a field as an expanding grass roots enterprise. 

Pythagoras and Quartz have recently completed their Saga of Cold EP (Dealmaker Records) which will be hitting eardrums early next year. Pythagoras is currently working on the 2nd C.O.L.D. album due to come out next winter.

Check out the current album 'a Glimmer through the Glacier'. Our intention is to bring a message of over-standing through knowledge and experience, and through the help of existing/ future projects, affect the lives of (especially) young people in a constructive and wholesome manner. Weve called it lyrical philosophy, or, deepcore.
