Hailing from Newcastle, Australia, Eat Your Heart Out (shortened as EYHO) consists of Caitlin Henry (vocals), Andrew Anderson (guitar), Will Moore (guitar), Dom Cant (bass), and Jake Cronin (drums). The band emerged in 2012, though it took them three years to self-release their debut EP "Distance Between Us" (2015). On that EP they played a brand of Pop Punk that was more on the Punk side of things, with some slight Grunge undertones. All that was helped by vocalist Caitlin Henry's distinctive voice. After they released their debut EP, the band got signed to American label Fearless Records and released two more EPs, "Carried Away" (2017) and "Mind Games" (2018). Their debut full-length album "Florescence" is coming out on May 17th, 2019. The album was produced by Patrick Miranda of Movements, who also did guest vocals on the song conscience off the "Mind Games" EP.

During their tenure as a band, EYHO has played shows with bands such as Trophy Eyes, Hands Like Houses, Knuckle Puck, and Real Friends. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/eat+your+heart+out">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
