Task Force are an underground British hip hop group from Highbury in London, England. The group is led primarily by two brothers Chester P (vocals, song writing and occasional music production) and Farma G (vocals, song writing and music production). The name Task Force has been undertaken however by DJ Louis Slipperz (music production and DJing) and loosely by Ramson Badbones (vocals and songwriting) who has appeared on a few releases as part of the group. Task Force officially formed in 1999 with their debut album New Mic Order distinguishing them from the London hip hop collectives Mud Family; of which Chester P was a founding member and the Bury Crew (named after Highbury in London), though Task Force are mutually considered members of both.

Chester P and Farma G were instrumental in reaffirming the unique identity that London possesses within global hip hop culture, signified by an overt resistance to the commercial music industry and a refusal to alter their musical content in order to make their music more palatable to mainstream and international audiences. Their music has generally been acclaimed for its uncompromising portrayals of the harsh realities of inner-city London. Their output has at times also been somewhat unconventional in that it has encompassed an honesty and ecological sobriety that is not frequently compatible with the materialistic bravado associated with modern hip hop culture. Their nonconformist stance is reflected in their use of dialectal, frequently almost cryptolectic slang.

Task Force earned relatively widespread recognition for its debut album New Mic Order which was produced by rapper Blade's former collaborator British producer Mark B and features a guest appearance from fellow Mud Family member Skinnyman and turntablism from Mr. Thing of the Scratch Perverts. Task Force has since released a back catalogue of considerable length, consisting for the most part of vinyl-only EPs and singles. In 2000 Task Force joined Braintax’s Low Life Records and released Voice Of The Great Outdoors, which featured Braintax and budding rapper and producer Jehst. A pivotal change in music style came when Task Force branched off to create their own independent label; Music From The Corner in 2001, marked by the release of Music From The Corner Volume 1. A darker more intense series of predominantly self-produced albums followed. Task Force is currently working on Music From The Corner Volume 5 and there is speculation of solo projects from Chester P and Farma G.
