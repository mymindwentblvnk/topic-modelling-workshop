eyeSEEred is a  Modern Melodic Death Metal from Mediaş. The oldest band members are MatheAlbert Eduard (Guitars), who founded the band in 2002 and  Bolgar Arpad Atilla (Drums), who joined the band in 2005.
Until 2007, when the band reiceved the current name, it has undergone a lot of controverses and hard times, with a lot of members coming and going, and played under different names, such as : Hoit, Fatal Force or Recovered.
The most important period of the band started in January 2007, when a radical change of the band line-up brought new memebrs into the band: Dumitrescu Trunks Ionut (Bass) and Bacea Dunkelgraf Daniel (Vocals), following in April: Benedek Balint (Sound Technician) and in  May: Tudor Turcu (Vocals)..
The name of the band, evolved into a personal meaning for the members, as a reaction towards the obsolete mentality and of the nonsense that is present in extreme situations, theat we encounter day by day, and that just makes us “see red”.
The biggest accomplishment in  2007 was the release of the first Demo, after three months of hard work.
