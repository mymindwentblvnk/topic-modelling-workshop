Cyberbully Mom Club started off as Shari Heck in April 2014 as an experimental songwriting project - recording a series of quick, personal songs and releasing them through Bandcamp under the album "Milo the Dog Sees Color." The solo project soon formed into a full band ordeal in September 2015, when close friends Sam Becht, Alex Melendez, and Peter Dimeo joined - though several solo EP's have been released since. The four have been together ever since. have toured, and play live shows debuting the "full band" versions of all of Heck's previously "lo-fi" songs that are available on Bandcamp.
