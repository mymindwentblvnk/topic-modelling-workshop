Ундервуд is a pop rock band from Crimea named after Underwood typewriter. It was formed by two doctors from Simferopol — Maksim Kucherenko and Vladimir Tkachenko. The band tries to revive russian-retro-rock motives in modern music, at the same time bringing intellectual rock to a new level.
The band has released five albums so far — 
2002 — Everything Will Pass, Honey (Все пройдет, милая)
2003 — The Red Button (Красная кнопка)
2005 — Loot's Ruling Over Evil (Бабло побеждает зло)
2007 — Opium for the People (Опиум для народа)
2008 — Everybody you loved so much (Все, кого ты так сильно любил)
They've also written the song that became cult for a time being and revived the image of Gagarin in russian minds — "Gagarin, I loved you" (Гагарин, я вас любила).
Maksim and Vladimir have also published two books of their poetry called "Sound and Silence" (Звук и Тишина) and "Opera et Studio". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/%D1%83%D0%BD%D0%B4%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B2%D1%83%D0%B4">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
