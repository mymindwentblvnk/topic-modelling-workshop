The story of the band goes way back and although Devillac was founded in the summer of 2000, band members have played together in various acts (including Supercruiser and Fuzzbender) for well over a decade.

After Daredevil Records released the well-received Devillac vs. Transonic Science split in 2001 the group started to work on a bunch of new songs for a full-length album that was recorded but never released as some major line-up changes were made in the band about six years ago.
Micki, the group’s current lead singer, replaced former vocalist Vesa, and Janne joined the group as the second guitarist. Devillac then began work on new growly rock’n’roll songs that would become the album Three Hours to Coma.

Devillac added guitarist Markus Bongardt in the summer of 2009, and the band is currently working on the follow-up to Three Hours to Coma. Devillac anticipates a spring 2010 release for the new album.
