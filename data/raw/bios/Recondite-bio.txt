Recondite (born Lorenz Brunner in Lower Bavaria) is a German musician, techno producer, label owner and sound artist. Brunner grew up in a rural area which is often named as source of his inspiration. His musical style is attributed as ambient, deep house and techno/acid techno. In fact, Brunner's musical output blurs the boundaries between these categories. The released Albums and EPs include melancholy and gloomy tracks, with a typically low bpm, and also veritable techno tracks created for the dancefloor. 

Recondite uses field recording and synthesizers. He works with the native operator synthesizer from Ableton, which combines analog sounds and frequency modulation synthesis. Except in the acid test productions, no further synthesizer are used by Brunner. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Recondite">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
