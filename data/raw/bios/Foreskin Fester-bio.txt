Foreskin Fester formed in Karlskrona, Sweden in 2002. Although the feel of a ploy band, with songs about sexually transmitted diseases, their music upheld quite a certain amount of quality, which gave them not only airtime on Swedish radio, but also a lot of fans. 

Fjalar The Horrible is (according to metal-archives.com) the one responsible for this mayhem. Foreskin Fester has been put on-hold due to "lack of members true enough to be invited into the band."

Destruction Of The Penis was recorded in 5 hours, the year 2003. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Foreskin+Fester">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
