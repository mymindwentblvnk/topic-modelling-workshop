Formed in 2007, the Ignition code project was born in order to give free play to the most absurd, violent and entangled side of their members, combining a
deep- rooted passion for complex tempo with sudden and apparently uncontrolled
outburst, without setting aside their melodic and sometimes intimist side, all
this under the direction of some influences such as Mnemic, Texture, In
flames...
The distorted idea of music coming out from this, it is melted with the continuous conflict between man and machine in which it is difficult to say who is the winner.
The ignition code’s crazy vision can’t be defined different from melodic math-death. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ignition+Code">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
