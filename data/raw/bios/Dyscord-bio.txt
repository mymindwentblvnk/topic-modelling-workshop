Hailing from Perth, Australia, Dyscord fuse many different facets of heavy music into a cohesive and well structured sound. Uncompromisingly brutal with generous splashes of melody, the band has achieved much in their short 4 year stint on the music scene. Including a national tour with The Black Dahlia Murder and supports with the likes of Killswitch Engage, Mudvayne, As I Lay Dying, The Haunted, Unearth, Static X, Darkest Hour and Ill Nino, and national supports with the likes of Parkway Drive, Truth Corroded, I Killed The Prom Queen, The Mark of Cain, 5 Star Prison Cell, Daysend, In Name and Blood, Against, Wendy Icon, The Dead Walk and Alchemist, Dyscord have been a driving force in the heavy scene as of late.
