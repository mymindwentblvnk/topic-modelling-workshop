Leeds-based electronic duo Harvey Blumler and Gosha Smith (aka Prospa) chart a course through classic house and rave-era dance music. Growing up, both Blumler and Smith were more interested in rock music, with the former taking up drums and the latter learning guitar. In their teenage years, they gained an interest in electronic music production: Blumler started out by crafting dubstep inspired beats, whilst Smith was intent on making jazz-infused hip hop. They crossed paths in the early 2010s, joining forces as producers in 2013, originally pursuing deep house before moving into classic rave sounds. They released their breakthrough single "Prayer" in 2018, helping to revive label Stress Records. Their debut EP, 2019's self-released Control the Party arrived the following year. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Prospa">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
