Formed from the ashes of seminal Swansea (South Wales) doom band Acrimony, Black Eye Riot treads a somewhat diferent path to any previous incarnations. Occasionally refered to as Oi!SludgePunkDoomCore (but usually not) this dual vocalist lumbering behemoth mixes the raw near-violence of REAL hardcore with heavier, more doomful fare to produce an unholy racket that (whilst almost entirely unpalatable to the majority of people) is considered to be quite arguably the single most fun you can have in a room full of strangers without disrobing to those in the know. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Black+Eye+Riot">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
