‘yon’ is the archaic dialect for the word ‘yonder’ (‘that’) . It indicates something (‘further but within sight’) (‘separated in space’) or (‘coming from/going to a ‘distance’ indicated). 'sample' while intended as a kind of ‘representation’, here means an ‘example’, ‘instance’ or ‘illustration’. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Yonsample">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
