After two studio demos with ENMORTEM, and a name change to THE EVERSCATHED, "The Razors Of Unrest" full length cd was released in 2006 by Open Grave Records. A self financed five song CD called "The Devils Cross" was recorded and released in 2008. The Path Of Soured Dreams two song promo cd was also recorded in this session. The band entered Stone Oak Studio in July 2010 to record the response to every loss, misfortune and bloodletting they've endured since inception, full length number two, "Still Screaming World". Eight songs perfectly mixed and mastered that are far more dynamic and vicious than anything these guys have ever recorded. This truly is dismal, yet enjoyable old school Death Metal from these obviously tenured scene veterans. The album will be released worldwide on CD & digital download by Allergicide Music on 11/09/10. The wounds of confusion will never heal, the razors of unrest will never dull and this still screaming world should defend itself. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Everscathed">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
