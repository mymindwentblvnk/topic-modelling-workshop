The band began spreading sickness and putrid tunes back in 2005 through the release of its first demo "Infernal Odium Schizophrenia". Line up changes were more than frequent til the second official strike which was nothing more that the re-release of the demo in a 4 way split with SUFFERATORY (russia), DEMISE (Philippines) and Mark Riddick's UNBURIED (USA), through Coyote Records.

The bastards gained experience by sharing the stage with acts such as Aborted, Severe Torture, Obscura, Belphegor, Dark Fortress among others, thus the recordings of the debut album started taking place in Grindhouse Studios Athens. Produced by George Bokos of the mighty Rotting Christ, the songs gained a massive sound and the album under the title "Resuscitation" was ready after thousands of work hours.

A search for label followed and after sometime the kind lads of Coyote Records agreed to release our debut in the first months of 2011. We hope you dig the tunes, take the time to listen to our samples and always support the underground in any way possible. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mortal+Torment">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
