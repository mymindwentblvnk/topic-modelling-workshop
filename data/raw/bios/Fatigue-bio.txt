5) Fatigue, a Brooklyn-bred rapper who now calls Fort Lauderdale, Florida home. Alex "Fatigue" Alexander was born in Brooklyn New York to a family of Guyanese origin. His cousins were always rapping and were heavy into hip-hop, so it was kind of predestined for this to be his dream. He and his cousins would just be free styling at the young ages of 9 -14 years old just for the art of it. Fatigue got the edge of putting rough lyrics together. He tries to keep away from all the drug selling and gun busting lyrics. Down South he has went from rapping in churches to rapping in schools. From 2001-2005 he has been with his group named Propaganda where they would perform at various events. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fatigue">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
