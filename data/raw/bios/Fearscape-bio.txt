Fearscape are a Progressive Extreme Metal band from the industrial city of Wollongong, NSW. The bandâ€™s influences include Opeth, Enslaved, My Dying Bride and Coroner. This has led to an intense atmospheric sound that blends Black Metal elements with Thrash and Doom styles of Metal.

Fearscape's debut CD entitled Sleeping in Light was recorded in Melbourne in mid 2004 under the tutelage of legendary Australian death metaller Steve Rowe of Mortification. The CD has been doing well overseas via Melbourne distributor Soundmass, and has been receiving very solid reviews.

Fearscape have been together for almost 6 years and have played shows in Melbourne VIC, NSW, QLD and New Zealand. Since 2005 Fearscape have been establishing themselves in the Sydney scene, through gigs promoted by Metal Evilution, alongside the likes of Paramaecium, Mortification, EyeFear, Lord, Head Hammer, Aeturnus Dominion, Lycanthia, Intorment Black, Kania, Forlorn Suffering and Friar Rush.

2007 saw Fearscape release their second full length album which demonstrated a more developed, progressive extreme metal sound. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fearscape">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
