There is more than one artist known as 27.

1. Hailing from Boston, Massachusetts, 27 has released records on Hydra Head, Reproductive and Relapse in the US and Undergroove in the UK. 27, or sometimes twentyseven or even twenty27seven are Maria Christopher, Ayal Naor, and Terri Christopher. Individually and as a band they have worked with bands such as Isis and Twin Zero.  Maria's haunting voice has been compared to Portishead or early Sneaker Pimps. The band share a lot of aspects musically with shoegaze and post-rock, but are equally adept producing all sorts of rock, indie, trip-hop and pop sounds.

27 has released multiple singles, 2 EPs, and 4 albums, the most recent of which is Brittle Divinity. The band has toured extensively throughout the U.S., Europe, and Japan, including tours supporting Isis and Minus the Bear. The band has had songs featured in a number of independent films, as well as TV shows including Showtime's "Shameless" and ABC Family's "The Lying Game".

2. Czech-based folk duo 27 was formed in 2011 by Ondřej Mataj (guitar, vocals) and Veronika Linhartová (violin, vocals). They released their debut album Meziplanetární soustavy in March 2013 (via Czech independent label Červený kůň). 27 play an intimate folk which is characteristic by engaging natural and love lyric poetry in its lyrics.
