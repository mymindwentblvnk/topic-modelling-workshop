Dzivia is a Belarusian music project created by a composer Artur Matveenko.

This music combines the sounds of a symphony orchestra, ancient instruments, massive choirs and tens of singers with dramatically different vocal techniques.

Even though Dzivia often finds itself within the genres of Nordic Folk, Ambient, Neoclassic, they don't really correspond to its unique sound. Since the very first album release, many years have been spent in search of that one and only sound that absorbs the best from the related genres, but is not fully similar to them. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dzivia">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
