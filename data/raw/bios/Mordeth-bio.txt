ROBOTICDREAMS... Much could be said about MORDETH: the early line-ups; the successive changes of band members; the inherent pek of troubles concerning to all brazillian bands, especially when they come from far away places from big cities capitals; its premature ending... But what’s the real value of this? In 1989, VLAD & WIT formed the first core of what would be MORDETH. The result of this partnership can be heard in the primitive sound – basically influenced by bands such MANTAS, HELLHAMMER, DARK ANGEL – of its self-titled DT (1990). The band’s musical maturing coincides with the admission of ALAIN MELENDEZ to the group, in the year of 1992. MORDETH starts to cristallize in the figure of these three musicians, as its second core, slowly defining its own and characteristic sound, which is growing up since the 7'EP “DIMENSION OF DEATH” (1992), followed by the LP “LUX IN TENEBRIS” (1994) and, at least, with the releasing of “CYBERGODS” (1995). Compared to previous works, “CYBERGODS” show an evident lyrical and musical progress, exploring original themes and riffs that pass for the most varied movements, creating an efective SCI-FI climate. To the musical level the band has achieved, they back to the studio and record “ANIMICIDE” (1997). The whole album is pure SCI-FI. Unfortunately, MORDETH breaks up in that same year, “ANIMICIDE” is released only in 2002, without any spreading and interests of its old members. During the period from 1997 to 2007, Alain Melendez abandoned completely the musical scene, VLAD formed the band HAL-9000 and WIT founded the MEGATHERION RECS label as well. Ten years after, here they are again. (To be continued...) <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mordeth">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
