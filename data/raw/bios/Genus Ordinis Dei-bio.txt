Genus Ordinis Dei - Symphonic Metal hailing from Crema, Italy

Genus Ordinis Dei were established in 2011 from a circle of friends residing in the same town. Between 2011 and 2012, the band sculpted its musical identity, melding the new millennium metal with symphonic sonorities.

At the start of 2012, their first self-produced album came out, "The Middle", heavily backed by an intensive run of live shows throughout Italy and Europe.

In 2013, thanks to their greatly received first album, they engaged with Mr Fabrizio Scotti, who has been working in the Italian music industry for many years. Together they started a project that opened up an opportunity to work with Mr Marco “Maki” Coti Zelati (Lacuna Coil) as producer.

With this new heavy crew, Genus Ordinis Dei started the recording of the new EP in February 2014, at the JDM Studio of Mr Jonas Macullo.

By late 2014 their new discographic project was completed, and since signing a world wide deal with Metal Music Bookings & Management the band are ready to take the world by symphonic storm.
