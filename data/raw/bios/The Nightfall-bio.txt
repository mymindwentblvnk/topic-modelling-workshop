The Nightfall was an Italian new wave / post-punk band from Mantova, formed in 1987 by Alberto Bonini (vocals, bass), Riccardo Campa (bass, keyboards), Nicola Moretti (guitar) e Marco Accorsi (drums).
They made live performances mostly in Emilia and Lombardy and recorded two demo tapes, "The Spirit of the Things" in 1988, and "Eutanasia" in 1989 and split up at the end of the year.
Alberto Bonini formed the goth rock band Mystery Plays, while Riccardo Campa is currently living in Cracow, Poland where he creates dance / electronic music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+nightfall">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
