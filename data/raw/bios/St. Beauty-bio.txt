St. Beauty is an American music group composed of two singers, Alexe Belle and Isis Valentino. The duo is affiliated with a larger artistic collective called Wondaland Art Society, a group of musicians that also includes Janelle Mon√°e, Jidenna, Roman GianArthur, and Deep Cotton. Both the duo and the collective are based in Atlanta, Georgia.

Belle and Valentino met while working at a clothing boutique that held a showcase for local artists in 2012. In light of the acclaim they received after the performance, the two officially formed a band and selected the name St. Beauty. In a recent interview, the duo explained that they selected the name because, "St. Beauty is a pure beauty that lives in everyone." Their mission is "to heal and inspire."

St. Beauty's song "Going Nowhere" appeared on the album, Wondaland Presents: The Eephus. The album was released on August 14, 2015, and was distributed by Epic Records. The album debuted at No. 5 on the Billboard Chart for R&B/Hip-Hop Albums. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/St.+Beauty">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
