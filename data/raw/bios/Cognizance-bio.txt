Cognizance was formed in the spring of 2012 when Baillie and Pryce had the belly fire to create a studio based death metal project.

Our debut EP 'Inquisition' combines a fusion of technical riffs with melodic lines and vocals straight from hell. The CD also features some exquisite guest appearances from;

Alex Rudinger- Drum performance
Aaron Matts (Betraying The Martyrs)
Reece Fullwood (Eumeria)
Scott Carstairs (Fallujah)
Sacha Laskow (Ex Divinity, Walk As Chaos)


Currently we are not a live performing band due to our lineup arrangement and busy schedules. However this could alter with time.

Guitar play-through videos will be released in the near future along with drum videos by Alex Rudinger.

EP & other merchandise released 1/02/2013.
