(1) Winter Moon (Melbourne, Australia) plays 'Blues Soul Psychedelic Rock 'n Roll'
"From humble beginnings as an acoustic duo, in just one year Winter Moon have gone from open-mic nights in dingy hotels with beer-stained carpets to headlines at some of Melbourne’s finest music venues- where not only the carpets but the walls, ceiling and stage bear the odd, brown markings of beer and music-fuelled revelry.
Now operating as a five-piece, including the usual array of members- plus a flute, Winter Moon take their cues from some of the greatest rock and blues bands of the ‘60s and ‘70s. With an enthralling live show, fusing psychedelic blues-rock with a modern edge and vintage sensibilities, this band has forged itself a solid presence as an original force of music in the Melbourne scene."
