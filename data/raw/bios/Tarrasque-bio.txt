Tarrasque is a solo project from Ben Zientara, co-founder of the Yith Recordings record label, and guitarist in The Kafka Dreams, Dreamless, and Yog-Sothoth.  The project is inspired by the works of Brian Eno, Susumu Yokota, The Album Leaf, Seefeel, and others in the ambient/electronic genre.  The music is basic, melodic, four-on-the-floor electronic music, meant to be gentle, simple, beautiful, and sometimes a little bit strange. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tarrasque">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
