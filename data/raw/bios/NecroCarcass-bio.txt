NecroCarcass' sound can be summed up as a melting pot of different genres and influences ranging from melodic death metal, to punk, classical and aspects of black metal. It was the brainchild of vocalist/guitarist Steve Dunnington in late 2006 before splitting up in late 2008.. 

After signing to This Dark Empire Records, they began writing and recording their first full length release entitled "The Fifth Stage". Combining multiple musical ideas with a common lyrical theme, they were able to develop a solid album with an array of songs to keep the listener's attention.
