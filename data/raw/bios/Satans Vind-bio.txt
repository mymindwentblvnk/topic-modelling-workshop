Lo-fi hi speed Swedish black metal band formed in Nyn√§shamn, Sweden in 1999. Released one demo Forenade i Hat mot gud in 2001 - of which there are two variations, one with a black cover with a baphomet on C60 tape and a white cover with what appears to be an exploding Byzantine church on C90 tape. They recorded a couple more tracks intended to be a demo tape for 2003, but instead Germany-based Satanic Supremacy Distro put them on a sampler called Dark Poetry with bands like Mutiilation and Necros Christos. Split up.
