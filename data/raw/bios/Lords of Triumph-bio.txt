In the winter of 2010, rhythm/lead guitarist Martin Meyer Mendelssohn Sparvath (Altar of Oblivion) began work on a new project and approached Phil Swanson (Hour of 13/Seamount) to take part.
They discussed ideas and concepts and it was decided to work this band in a different way than their other bands to avoid repetition or comparison. So rather than Phil take on as lyricist, it was decided that Martin would write the words based on Phil’s phonetic vocal arrangements in order for the vocals to retain the integrity to Phil’s style but perhaps allow him to be heard in a slightly different and new light.
Within weeks, they had all the music and lyrics written and recorded to a rough demo and began pre-production on a full-length bringing on board a full band of notable Danish musicians to fill in on bass and drums as Martin tagged this new band as “Lords of Triumph”.
The two tracks available for streaming here on ReverbNation are taken from the aforementioned pre-production which originally was released for label interest only but as the sound quality turned out better than expected, we wanted to share these tracks with you and thereby do a little promotion until the final and “real” recordings are complete.
Our 6-track debut album “Longing for Dimness” will be recorded at some point during the summer of 2011 and can best be described as epic/traditional doom metal in the tradition of Ozzy-era Black Sabbath, Trouble, Pentagram, Nemesis/Candlemass, Solstice/Serenity and the like.
The track-list will be as follows:
1. Shadow Asylum 
2. Protectors of Sham 
3. Rules of Blasphemy 
4. Frailty 
5. Destructive Mindscape 
6. Longing for Dimness <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lords+of+Triumph">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
