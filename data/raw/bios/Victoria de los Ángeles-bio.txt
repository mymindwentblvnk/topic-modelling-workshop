Victoria De Los Angeles was born in Barcelona 1 November 1923 and died 15 January 2005. She was a well-known soprano and well-known as the sweetest of singers. Her career spanned two periods, the early 1940s to the mid 1970s and again in the 1990s. She participated admirably in the closing celebration at the 1992 Barcelona Olympic Games with her native Catalan ‘El cant dels ocells’ in at the age of 70, manifesting that her own flame had not been extinguished. She began as an opera singer but turned increasingly to recitals, becoming foremost in this field (she’d begun recitals from her debut in her early 20s), including English song, German lieder, the French Chanson, excelling in the Spanish repertoire, where she was thought to really let go, so comfortable was she in this, her beloved native domain. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Victoria+de+los+%C3%81ngeles">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
