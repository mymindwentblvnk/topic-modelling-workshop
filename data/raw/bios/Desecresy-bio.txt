Desecresy is a Finnish Death Metal band formed in 2009 by Tommi Gr√∂nqvist (all instruments) and Jarno Nurmi (vocals) both from the now extinct Slugathor. Inspired by  90's Death Metal, although Desecresy doesn't settle just to be a so called "old school" band. Their aim is to make Death Metal as it should be, not as it once was.
