Downstone was formed during the fall 2005 in Oulu/Kemi, Finland. The band was originally put together as a side project by the band mates Markku Kerosalo(bass) and Ville Markkanen(drums). At the time they were members of the band called May I Cry and they found Kai Kinnunen through internet to play the guitar for their new project. The next step was to find a vocalist. A little later Kai accidentally heard Valtteri singing and he was immediately certain that Valtteri’s voice would suit perfectly to the sound of Downstone. Luckily Valtteri was available for the job. After a few rehearsals and time spent on composing the band realized that they needed another guitarist to fatten up the sound. Tommi came along after a couple of months and the band was up for action…Not too long after the formation the band was in real trouble, ‘cause Markku and Ville left the band due to a lack of time. Kai already knew Juha from their previous projects together. Juha was eager to face the challenge and replaced Ville on the drums. At the same time the band was also actively looking for a new bass player and Tapsa was soon to complete the new line-up. Very soon after the changes Downstone went to record their first demo in Sirius-studios and it was released in early June 2006 on their website. As for now the band is due to put out another demo in the near future and concentrating writing new material for upcoming gigs in spring and summer 2007. “We want to have a kick ass set from the very beginning”, says Tommi and continues: “We’re a new group, but we don’t need performances to get our shit together. We want to bring out the best we can from the very first performance”. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Downstone">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
