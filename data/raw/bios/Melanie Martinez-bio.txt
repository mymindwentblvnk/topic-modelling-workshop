Melanie Adele Martinez (born April 28, 1995) is an American singer-songwriter, artist, director, actress, dancer, clothing designer, and photographer. 

Born in Astoria, Queens and raised in Baldwin, New York on Long Island, she first participated in the MSG Varsity Talent Show during her junior year of high school, and subsequently rose to prominence in 2012 after appearing on the American television vocal talent show The Voice. She auditioned singing Britney Spears's Toxic, and made it to the Top 6 before being eliminated in the fifth week of live shows. 

Immediately following her departure from the show, she began independent work on original material. She began recording for a (later-scrapped) EP in 2013 with acts such as John Feldmann and Doveman. Eventually becoming tired of that sound and wanting to experiment, she wrote "Dollhouse" at a session with Kinetics & One Love in September of that year. This song kickstarted the Cry Baby theme/sound. 

Signing to Atlantic Records soon after, Melanie released her debut EP, Dollhouse (2014). The EP had 2 singles, Dollhouse & Carousel and included songs that were recorded during sessions for her then-upcoming debut.

Martinez later released her debut studio album, Cry Baby (2015), which debuted at number 6 on the Billboard 200 and was certified platinum by the RIAA. It currently has over 2.6 billion streams on Spotify and all of the album tracks are certified by the RIAA. 

Martinez released her second studio album “K-12” along with an hour and a half long film with the same name on September 6, 2019, featuring hits such as "Show & Tell" "Nurse's Office" "Strawberry Shortcake". She then released the accompanying After School EP on September 25, 2020. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Melanie+Martinez">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
