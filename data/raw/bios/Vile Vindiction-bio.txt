Vile Vindiction consists of members from the general Buffalo, N.Y. area. Member credits include; Jim Nickles, one of the guitarists, co-founded the band Malevolent Creation in 1986 and later did an Eastern U.S. tour with the band Hellwitch in 1991. George Grant, the other guitarist, originally founded Vile Vindiction in 1991. However, the band never got off the ground due to a failure to find members to complete the lineup. Ultimately, one track was recorded in '91 on a compilation called "Frozen Metal Thunder" released by Siberia Sound Productions in Buffalo, N.Y. In 2007 George Grant and Jim Nickles were determined to get this project going, so they searched for members, and in April of 2008 teamed up with Vocalist Kris Poole, Drummer Evan Leuer, and Bassist Chad Cogar. The trio are formerly of new school metal bands Forgotten Theory and Buffalo's Body Born Still. With this young talent, the veterans found a fresh sound that is reminiscent of old school, with strong, focused riffing and brutal drumming combined with modern vocal styling. Their debut EP has proved to be brutal and yet filled with structure and melody. Vile Vindiction has also teamed up with Mark Cooper of Mindrape Art, in New Smyrna Bch. Fla. to handle the illustrations. Vile Vindiction strives to deliver the sick and twisted truth of today's reality in the lyrics and energy delivered, without compromising a single note. Vile Vindiction has played locally with tremendous response. Their fans are quickly growing in number, and have already received positive recognition in www.Metal-Rules.com zine.Their first full length was released independantly on April 4th 2009.
