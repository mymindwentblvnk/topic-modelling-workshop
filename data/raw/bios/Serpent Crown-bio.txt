Serpent Crown was formed in early 2008 by Dara Santhai and Will Carroll, with the aspiration of creating aggressive, ultra heavy, riff driven music, drawing from various elements within the genre of metal, while being stylistically cohesive. Dara had fronted several bands in the Bay Area (Ravana, Santhai), while pursuing a career in the fine arts, and Will is a veteran drummer playing in band such as Old Grandad, Cuttroats 9, Scarecrow, Vicious Rumors and Machine Head. They recorded their first demo a year later, which was produced by Rafa Martinez of Black Cobra- who also filled in on bass during the recording. They were sortly joined by Laurie Safdie who played a string of shows with then. She was later replaced by Dave Dinsmore who performed in a later incarnation of B’last, LAB, and Unida. He is the current bass player. They continue to churn out heavy riffs and play shows, in between Will’s tours with Death Angel. ..  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Serpent+Crown">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
