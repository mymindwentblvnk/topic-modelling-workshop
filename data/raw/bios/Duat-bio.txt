1. Duat is a death metal/grindcore band from Bosnia & Herzegovina, Bihac. The band was formed at the beginning of 2009. 

The first line-up consisted of Riad and Adin on guitars, Alen on drums, Dino on bass and Emir Ramić on vocals. Soon after the band settled up, Adin left so the band continued with one guitar only. The band’s vision was to play a combination of death metal, thrash metal with less or more hardcore influence. Right before the first gig the band got a new vocal, Emir Toromanović and with his arrival the style changed. From that moment on, Duat is considered to be death metal and grindcore. Emir Ramić left the band but he also appeared as guest vocalist on every gig and the first EP „Misery“, which was released in september of 2010.

For a long period the band worked like a quartet. At the beginning of 2011 the band announced the new member on guitar, Benjamin and today’s line-up consists of five members. At the moment the band is about to release their new EP „A Vision To Show“ via Beyond The Sun Records.
