Ramesses was a sludge / doom metal band from Dorset, England, featuring ex-members of Electric Wizard. Ramesses was formed in February 2003 by Tim Bagshaw and Mark Greening (ex-Electric Wizard) with Adam Richardson formerly of Lord of Putrefaction, Spirmyard, and Hexed. They play a form of "crushing blackened doom" with "torrential riffing", "concussive percussion" and frightening growls[citation needed] composed during "freeform psychedelic jams".

In 2011 the band released their 3rd full-length album "Possessed By The Rise of Magick". Then shortly followed it up with the studio/live ep "Chrome Pineal". It featured 3 new studio tracks and 3 live tracks recorded in 2007. In 2012 it was announced that Founding member / guitarist Tim Bagshaw had left the band. Tim had moved from England to the United States and formed the sludge / doom metal band Serpentine Path with all 3 members of the band Unearthly Trance. Mike Vest of the band Bong filed in on guitar for live performances.

On January 29, 2013 on their official website the band announced an "hibernation". It had also been stated on Mark Greenings facebook page that he had quit the band in October 2012 to rejoin a previous band, name of said band not mentioned. The band Greening re-joined was confirmed to be Electric Wizard. Adam Richardson is working on a new project entitled 11Paranoias with Mike Vest of "Bong". Mark Greening was also a previous member of that project. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ramesses">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
