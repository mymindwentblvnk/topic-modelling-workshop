History:

The first album (8-song cassette), Ornamental Ironworks, was released in 1993, featuring a progressive rock influence. Behind Closed Doors, which featured a more progressive metal sound and was their first actual label release, was released in 1996 on the Noise Records (Germany) record label.

In 1997, original singer/bassist Falcon left the band and was replaced by Phil Leite (vocals) and Ken Firomski (bass). The third album, Changing Currents, was released in 1998 independently and distributed by Nightmare Records (U.S.A.).

A progressive metal compilation album, The Awakening, was released in 1998 by KMI Ent., which featured Empyria's title track Changing Currents.

In 2000, The Legacy was released by Nightmare Records (USA). It featured for the first time all four parts of Empyria's The Lighter Sides of Darkness as a continuous 25-minute epic, plus a cover of The Police's "Synchronicity II".

The next album, Sense Of Mind, from 2002, continued the vein of the previous album in general, adding more melody to the songs.

A compilation album , Westcoast Canadian Metal Feast, was released in 2001, just prior to Empyria's Sense Of Mind album and featured the title track.

In 2003, Empyria took a long hiatus due to Kischnick's involvement in 7 albums and 2 tours with Canadian Metal band Thor and various other projects.
