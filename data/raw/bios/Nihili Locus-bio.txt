Nihili Locus was formed in 1989 in Nichelino, Italy as Omicidio. The style was death/thrash metal and the band released a demo tape "Premature Exequie" in 1991 and played live several times. The original line-up consisted of Bruno on vocals, Massimo on bass, Mauro on guitar and Robi on drums. After the release of the demo the line-up changed with the addition of Valla on second guitar and music style started to evolve beyond death metal and so they decided to change the name to Nihili Locus. They recorded and released a self-produced 7"EP Sub Hyerosolyma in 1992, a concept demo tape ...Advesperascit... in 1994, added Simone on keyboard and then in 1995 the MCD ...Ad Nihilum Recidunt Omnia was released on the Italian underground label Boundless.

The band had already written and finalized several songs for a full-lenght album when in 1996 founding members Mauro and Robi decide to leave the band due musical differences and the band splits soon after that. The band reformed in 2001 and tried to make a new start with fresh compositions but unfortunately this effort did not last and they split up again in 2003.

In 2008 Massimo, Mauro and Robi met up again and decided to give Nihili Locus another shot, this time as a three-piece and returning more to their roots with the music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nihili+Locus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
