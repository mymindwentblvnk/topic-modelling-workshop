Amesoeurs (/ɑmsœʀ/, French for “Soulmates”) was a French blackgaze band from Avignon, Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur, founded in summer 2004 by Stéphane “Neige” Paut, Audrey Sylvain, and Fursy Teyssier, with the purpose of creating music that reflects the dark side of the industrial era and modern civilization. The music combined black metal with elements of post-punk and shoegaze. 

A few songs were immediately written and the band performed one gig in 2005. Shortly after, Fursy Teyssier decided to leave the band to go back to his studies. In April 2005, a first MCD titled Ruines humaines was recorded. Neige used two tracks (« Bonheur amputé » and « Ruines humaines ») he had originally composed for Mortifera, which he had just been leaving at the time. Amesoeurs sent the MCD to a few labels, but had to wait 2006 to see its release through German label Northern Silence Productions. Amesoeurs has worked with the photographer Isabelle Hanssen for the pictures of Ruines humaines and the graphic designer Fursy Teyssier so as to create a visual environment which perfectly suits the music.

In March of 2009, the group decided to split up, after releasing their debut album, due to tensions in the band. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Amesoeurs">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
