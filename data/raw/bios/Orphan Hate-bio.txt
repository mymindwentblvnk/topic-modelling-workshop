Orphan Hate (Germany) take the best of what Thrash, Death-, and Progressive Metal produced in the last 20 years and combine it with current influences spanning across all musical genres. With absolutely talented instrumentalists and an extremely versatile vocalist, they are demonstrating their own concept of modern metal. The grooves are deadly precise and the lines are chart breaking. ... 
Consequent varied compositions for all open minded Metalheads enfolded in a superstrong sound.
 (Legacy) A band without a record deal, but one of three winners of VIVA's battle of the bands contest. Their current CD will probably change this situation soon. (Heavy World) 
Metalfusion is what this quintet from Berlin calls their style. The melodic Metalcore-borrowings reveal, why ORPHAN HATE thought of this broad term for their music. There is a whole lot of potential within this band. These kids are showing a technically excellent performance, taking this intensive Death Metal to a higher level.

They recently signed to Plainsong Records and will release their debut full-length CD "Blinded by Illusions" on May 16. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Orphan+Hate">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
