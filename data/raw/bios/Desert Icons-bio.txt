With a name like Desert Icons, you’d think these guys (and girl) would play your standard, fuzzed out, stoner rock. But as the old saying goes…don’t judge a book by its cover. Today’s NBTBOT is a six piece from Madrid, Spain that has little in common with the laid back desert rock scene that their name seems to conjure up and much more to do with a bastardized mix of sludge, fuzz and (gasp) metalcore. 

Throw the raw brutality of High on Fire, the grooves of Red Fang and the melody of In Flames into a blender, pulse it around a bit and you’ve got yourself a cocktail called Desert Icons. The band achieves their unfettered wall of noise by way of a bludgeoning three guitar attack and vocals that alternate between ferocious low end growls and raspy high pitched wails. Hit play on these five tracks and then sit back and prepare to have your eardrums decimated. This early in the week, this is just the panacea you need to survive until Friday.
