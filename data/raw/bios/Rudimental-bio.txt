Rudimental are an east London (UK) music quartet, comprising the songwriters and producers Piers Agget, Kesi Dryden and Amir Amor, together with DJ Locksmith. 

They have stated that they are on a mission to bring back soul into electronic music, and are quoted as saying: “We aren’t just electronic bedroom producers, and we’re not just guitarists and pianists who don’t know much about making a beat”.  They grew up on everything from grime to jazz and blues, from hip-hop to house, and state: “You can’t really box us into a category, we’re more about musicality, songwriting and broader influences. We are Sly and the Family Stone, Todd Edwards and Dr. Dre in a cheeseburger!”

The original Rudimental trio go back a long way. Piers and Locksmith grew up on the same road in Hackney, with Kesi living just around the corner in Stoke Newington, where he went to the same school as Labrinth and Professor Green.  Amir joined the collective in mid-2011 after working with them on some remixes.
