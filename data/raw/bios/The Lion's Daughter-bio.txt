THE LION’S DAUGHTER was born out of a hatred for the insincere and uninspired cookie-cutter fodder the mainstream metal scene has become. They takes notes from black metal and doom, but live by no musical limitations and are driven to please no audience but themslves. The band’s most recent work is a prime example of their play-to-please-no-one credo. Previous releases include two self-released EPs, a 12” split with Fister (Hands up Records, 2011), and the full length Shame On Us All (Pissfork, 2012), which Cvlt Nation described as a, “hard-hitting blast of bruising riffs that will surely leave you drained from start to finish.” The trio was created in 2007 by guitarist/vocalist Rick Giordano and drummer Erik Ramsier after leaving a band that neither liked much, and named their new project after a campy romance novel they saw at the airport because fuck it. Scott Fogelbach of Love Lost But Not Forgotten soon joined and opening spots for Torche, Nachtmystium, High on Fire, Dark Funeral, Eyehategod, and more ensued as well as a national tour with Fister, with the band delivering a live show that the Riverfront Times called, “absolutely punishing.” Additionally, THE LION’S DAUGHTER won the RFT Reader’s Poll “Best Metal Band” (in St. Louis) award in 2011 and again in 2013. Forever Cursed calls THE LION’S DAUGHTER, “one of the most underrated bands out there,” No Clean Singing champions their, “heavy, harsh, and harrowing,” sound while The Bone Reader welcomes their,“caustic, blistering noise of the post-apocalypse.” But the band doesn’t play as if it simply wants to see the world end; it sounds like they want to be the ones to destroy it. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Lion%27s+Daughter">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
