Darkager is a Brazilian metal band which was formed in 2003 by Vítor Pucciarelli, Júlio Pucciarelli, Lucas Curtarelli and Manoela Ferreira, initially just playing covers of power and melodic metal bands. During this period the band stayed without a vocalist, searching for someone who had a unique voice. In 2004 they met Carol Miranda (Rondrakamm), who was invited to play with them in a few shows as guest vocalist, and some time later became a permanent member. 

Still in the same year the band started to compose their first songs, and with the addition of the keyboardist Luis Felipe Emm they decided to record a demo. In 2006 their first demo, Bells of Doom, was released, containing four tracks, "Pandemonium Arrival", "Darkager", "Bells of Doom" e "Gloria". Soon after the release Luis Felipe Emm leaves the band, being replaced by Leandro Moritto. 

During the process of promoting the demo, Darkager played in several brazilian festivals, and in 2007 signed with Fusão VMT studios to record the debut cd, which will be procuded by Shaman's vocalist Thiago Bianchi, who already produced albums of bands like Karma, Edu Ardanuy, Angra, Tuatha de Danann and Shaman itself. 

Their debut, still untitled, will have ten songs, and shall be released in the second half of 2007, presenting the band's new line-up, after Leandro Moritto and Manoela Ferreira being replaced by Gabriel Maggioni and João Manechini. 

Darkager's proposal was formed in power metal, but with time it received influences of diverse metal sub-genres, creating the power/thrash metal identity which will be seen in their debut.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Darkager">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
