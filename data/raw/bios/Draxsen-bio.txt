Hi and welcome to the world of Draxsen!

Draxsen is in existence for one thing and one thing only (Apart from playing music) and that is to increase the awareness of those who suffer with and those who have to live with some one in Chronic pain. This condition can be as hard on the carers as it is on the people afflicted, Obviously in different ways. Apart from the obvious pain and the irritation and tension that that causes the sufferer, But the medication used for the control of this pain is a very very very thing ling to balance. Don't eat at the right time, forget a pill, not noticing a substance you should avoid in you diet on the packet at the supermarket can all lead to psychotic breaks ranging from a fit to hysterically screams and crying for hours on ends with out any way of consoling you. Just ask my wife! If you ever needed proof of the existence of angle you only have to ask and I will introduce you to her.
The long and the short of it is Draxsen does not make $1. So instead of sending your donations or a thankful offering for any of or songs you have down loaded, Send it to the nearest help centre to you, Draxsen is a group of dedicated people with little skill an energy, But now have a reason to get out of bed everyday. Prior to the coming together of Draxsen many of these people live a horrible life with constant pain. The debilitation of the pain combined with the side effects of pain killers leaves the sufferers in lengthy bouts of depression.
So armed with this information. Download the sounds share them with your friends an if it happens to come up in conversation. Just mention what you know about depression and how you can help.
