First conceived in 2009, "Tchornobog" is not a worship of the Slavic "Black God". It is a result of heavy meditation in a desert landscape from the perspective of a vessel mountain which harbors a nest for the Mind's Eye to be imprisoned. I witnessed -- without any hope of my eye closing -- the terrible sensory overload of the black vomit of Tchornobog. The recordings provided here are a sonic journal of the metaphorical events and the empathetic interpretation of a landscape in my skull.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tchornobog">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
