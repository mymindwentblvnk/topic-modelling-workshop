LEFT IN TORMENT is the translation of the very essence of melancholy, not obsessed by death or mourning but rather a constructive attempt to create a cosmos beyond nihilism and a prayer towards Saturn across the depths of his astral planes.
LEFT IN TORMENT can be defined as Funeral-Doom. Then again melancholy and sadness are considered as part of a spiritual path and not as a finality of it's own.
To those of the saturnian path carrying the flame is a duty and neither a gift nor a fate.

Left in Torment is a majestic kaleidoscope of ice-cold hopelessness and despair. Both dark and beautiful, they easily live up to their name as they churn out crushing melodies of pain and woe. The songs are drenched with keyboards, pianos and violins. The guitars are a slow crushing wave of misery and the drums sloth forth at a mid paced tempo. They do not focus a lot of vocals though, just a few growls and an occasional spoken sentence or two. They sound like a mix between Ea, The Howling Void and Shape of Despair. If you can find em, get em! - Xi_Serpentis
