Pucca (IPA pronunciation: [pu ka] poo-ka) is a media franchise from the South Korean company Vooz Character Systems.

The main character Pucca is the young ward of three Chinese noodle house owners. The Noodle House is located in Sooga Village, a small Chinese village in the mountains. Pucca is in love with the ninja, "Garu" (IPA pronunciation: [geɪ ɹu] gaa-roo). However, he desperately tries to avoid Pucca's advances, and (usually) does not return her affection. While Garu is a skilled ninja, Pucca always seems to best him in combat and unintentional competition, simply by sheer wit.

The characters are quite popular in Europe and Asia, with TV animation in cartoon channels in Europe and South America. These animations are compiled into a DVD, available in Germany. A UK children's book publisher (Hodder's) has also published a series of Pucca children books. The UK also has pencil cases/tins, stationary and notebooks/diaries. In Israel, a Pucca branded snack was launched on May, 2006.

There is also an on-going manhwa series in Korea, which has been translated into Chinese and German, of Pucca and Garu traveling around the world through an enchanted board game. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pucca">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
