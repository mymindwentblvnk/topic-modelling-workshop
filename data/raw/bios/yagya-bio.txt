Icelandic producer Yagya (Aðalsteinn Guðmundsson) has been creating atmospheres through melody and sounds for more than a decade. A definitive member of the Thule Musik collective, Yagya also is known for his work as half of Sanasol and also the famed Plastic.

Yagya spends his free time creating music on his computer. He concentrates on atmospheres and moods and tries to reflect the beauty of the world around him in the sounds of his music. He seeks influence in the works of Gas, Philip Glass, Basic Channel, Brian Eno and anything that is true to itself and its ideas. Yagya concentrates on the softer side of music and avoids heavy rhythms. He finds harmony and beauty in the simple sounds of nature and wants his music to flow naturally through the listener.
