Formed in early 2011, Shattered Destiny is a progressive power/thrash band created by lead singer/songwriter JJ. The unique blend of musical influences forms a niche within the metal world. The EP features Mark Zonder (Fates Warning, Warlord) on drums. The “Fragments” EP will be released on March 20, 2012.

“Fragments” was recorded in Rogue Studios Sweden by Martin Brändström (Dark Tranquillity) under the supervision of Joacim Cans (HammerFall) in early 2012. Pontus Norgren (HammerFall) — who brilliantly created a heavy, powerful, yet contemporary sounding album — mixed the EP. “Fragments” features original artwork by Niklas Sundin (Dark Tranquillity) and was mastered at Fascination Street by Jens Bogren (Amon Amarth, Opeth).  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Shattered+Destiny">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
