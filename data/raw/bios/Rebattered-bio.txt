Rebattered was founded in late October 2002 and used the last five years to write lots of songs and to define their musical style. Directly from the start the band bended the musical borders of metal, mixing different styles of the genre (and added also i.e. little funk parts) to try to make the music sound more interesting to the listener. During the last years Rebattered underwent some line-up changes, which made the band sound more modern and compact, due to the contribution of the new members and the band's growing focus on the essence of their music, not trying anymore to work with every little influence there might be.
Rebattered stands for neckbreaking thrashmetal with a lot of groove and little shots of deathmetal and mathcore, mainly influenced by bands such as Pantera, Machine Head, Metallica, Slayer or Meshuggah.
In the beginning of 2007 the band recorded together with producer Martin Below their first demo-cd, entiteld Wheel Of Misfortune, at the Scumfeed-Productions studio in Cologne, Germany. Shortly after, our bassist had to leave the band and we searched for a replacement which we quickly found in the person of Sven Weidemann. The official release of Wheel Of Misfortune will be on the 7th of april 2008 and the next step for the band will be to get a record- or management-deal, to make sure that more people will be able to see and feel the power the band unleashes during their blasting live shows and to have the possibility to bring their music to all the people in the world who are interested in listening to it. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rebattered">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
