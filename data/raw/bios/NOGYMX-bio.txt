Irish-born South Korea-based producer and composer, NOGYMX is best-known for his atmospheric chill hip-hop instrumentals often featuring sounds inspired by his eight plus years in Korea.
 
Known at home as Jimmy Dunne, the now 30-year-old Irishman began making music as ‘No Gimmicks’ pre-2013 before shortening to the often mispronounced ‘NOGYMX’. After gaining a YouTube following in the hip-hop beats scene, Jimmy took a break from music for almost 5 years before returning at the end of 2018 with a new passion for the craft.
 
Influenced by artists such as Emancipator; Glimlip; Nujabes; Apollo Brown, and described by Stereofox Records as “floating in a cross-genre sweet-spot that splits the difference between Bonobo and Freddie Joachim”, NOGYMX has spent the last few years developing his style and creating his own signature blend of chillhop beats and slick electronic production. 
 
Having worked with some of the genre’s biggest and best labels including: Stereofox Records; Lofi Girl; Chillbeats Music; The Jazz Hop Cafe; Dreamhop and more, NOGYMX has gathered a dedicated following with over 40,000,000 streams on Spotify alone. This has been helped by fans from all around the globe who have added his music to more than 120,000 of their playlists.
 
With three albums in the pipeline, NOGYMX shows no signs of slowing down in 2022. For him, his journey has just begun. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/NOGYMX">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
