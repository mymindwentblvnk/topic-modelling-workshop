To know the band Enemy Remains one must first take a solid look at the drummer formerly of Fates Warning, who achieved 4 complete albums off Metal Blade Records. You must also take in with empathy, the lyrics which embrace emotion along with the precise speed chugging,& progressive heavy guitar riffs of former Moltens Lore and Interface member, Thomas Blardo. These two inseparable team players create the core members of Enemy Remains.

ENEMY REMAINS formed in late November 2005, completed its first 6 song demo project at HG Recording studio in Deltona, Florida. Enemy Remains has continued to establish many successes including becoming sponsored by Dirtbag Clothing through their new management WitchWizard Entertainment, welcoming their new logo and merch, gracing the stage at Locobazooka 2007, Dragonfest 2008, and are currently looking to add more shows to the list.

In 2010, the lineup would eventually change, Enemy Remains, currently finishing their auditions, would improve and solidify the band. Enemy Remains are about to about to embark on their adventure for 2011 starting with the unveiling of Rockband in the Spring. Enemy Remains is also currently finishing auditions which will enable them to head into the studio ( To Be Announced), to record their first album. Look forward to newer material to grace the pages and stages in 2011 !!! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Enemy+Remains">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
