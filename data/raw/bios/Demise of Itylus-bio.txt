Demise of Itylus was founded by guitarist Connor McCullough and drummer / vocalist J.T. Goldmann in January 2010 in Orange, CA.   They began practicing and writing drum, bass, and vocal parts to several songs Connor had written on guitar, including Death After Life and Lucid Reality.  After being selected to headline the third stage of OCHSA's Ochella festival, Connor and JT recruited Tamara Win on bass and Paul Parcell on rhythm guitar.  Their two song Apocalypse of Serenity EP was released in early June.  They played several shows during this time, including Ochella, Chain Reaction, and a headlining appearance on Arrowbear's Tan Rock Festival with Oren Berkowitz filling in on rhythm guitar.

After Connor and Tamara both left to the East Coast, the bands future was in question, however Connor and JT continued recordings and tentative plans were made for a CD release, as well as January show dates.  The band became active again in November 2010-January 2011, with Aaron Stechauner taking over on drums and JT becoming vocalist. Recordings for their debut CD, 'The Nightingale' were finished by January, and the band played several shows in support of the CD.  

James Goldmann - Vocals
Connor McCullough - Guitar
Spencer Strange - Guitar
Tamara Win - Bass
Aaron Stechauner - Drums

Following release of this CD, writing began for the band's follow up, which was expanded from an EP to a full-length.  The band returned to playing shows in June 2011, with a new lineup featuring Daniel Simpson on guitar for one show, until Spencer Strange was permanently recruited.  New songs have been played live and recording for the follow up CD will begin shortly.  Through promotion and show playing, the band is hoping to make a name for itself.   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Demise+of+Itylus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
