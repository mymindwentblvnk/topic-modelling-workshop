2) Nosebleed is a punk rock band from Belgrade, Serbia.
In April of 2005 Nosebleed was assembled by five individuals, with the idea of playing melodic hardcore in the vein of Thrice, Funereal for a Friend and the like. In September of that same year, the band played its first show in Belgrade. Since then, they had many gigs, most important of which was during the Exit 06 Festival in the open air setiting of the ancient fortress in the city of Novi Sad.
Early this year, they recorded their first single, "Flashback", which ended up getting released on a hardcore/metal compilation by the US Dennehy Records. In May, they finished EP "A 5 Piece Introduction", and made songs available for download on their MySpace page. Currently, the recording of the first Nosebleed LP is finished and the band is in the process of finding a publisher. For now, the full album is available for download on their Last.fm page.
