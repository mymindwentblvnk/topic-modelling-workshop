Volcano Suns was an American alternative rock band from Boston, Massachusetts. Their music is often compared to the works of bands like Hüsker Dü and Mudhoney. They were founded in 1983 by former Mission of Burma drummer Peter Prescott, the only founding member of the band to remain until their break-up in 1991. Original members include the aforementioned Peter Prescott as drummer and vocalist, Jeff Wiegand on bass guitar and Jon Williams on guitar. This line-up appeared on their debut The Bright Orange Years (1985) as well as it's follow up, All Night Lotus Party (1986), both appearing on the now-defunct Homestead Records. In 1987, Bob Weston replaced Wiegand on bass guitar and Chuck Hahn replaced Williams replacing for Bumper Crop, the band's final release on Homestead. Other contributions included Roger Miller on piano and Gary Waleik on sitar.

In 1988, the band moved to Greg Ginn's SST Records for their 4th and most experimental release, Farced. The line-up however was the same as on Bumper Crop, including Miller on piano and Waleik on sitar. 1989 brought Thing of Beauty, also on SST, which brought David Kleiler to replace Chuck Hahn on guitar. This would be the Volcano Suns' final line up. The band moved to Chicago-based indie label Quarterstick Records for their final release, Career in Rock in 1991. The album was engineered by Steve Albini, who would later work with Bob Weston in their band Shellac. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Volcano+Suns">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
