Inhuman Conditions were a harcore punk band formed in 1986. Not much information has been given out after they've split up in 1990. They've only released one EP through Nuclear Blast in 1989 known as Deserve No Respect which was a very politcal EP.

Although it ran for 12 minutes it was an important EP for many punk cultures around at the time and they were given an opportunity to play live in a few countries including: Righteous Pigs  and Rostok Vampires  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Inhuman+Conditions">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
