Romanian Phaser band was born on the 8th of March 2007 in it's actual componence, with the initiative of Razvan Pomoja and Radu Racz. Together we are five teenagers that love music and since we formed this band we are trying to make ourselves heard and play 24/7. Our songs have simple, yet precise lyrics about what gives us pleasure and ambition. Until now, we composed eleven songs, in which we combined more styles of music: blues, funk, rock, pop-rock, jazz. Along our "rock journey", that now consists of over 60 concerts, we were very excited about the fact thet we shared the stage with some of the biggest and greatest Romanian bands, such as Phoenix, Cargo, Iris, Timpuri Noi, Ovidiu Lipan Tandarica, Semnal M, Celelalte Cuvinte, Taxi, Directia 5, Vita de Vie, Zdob si Zdub, Luna Amara, Desperado, Implant Pentru Refuz, Trooper, Bio. From this Fall, Phaser band now finds Timisoara as their new home, while playng some new gigs, in a new formula. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Phaser">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
