The second album II (2004) compiles three lengthy live tracks from the band's Finnish tour in March 2003. The third album 28 août 2005 (2005) is a live concert recorded in Nantes, France in August 2005. The latest album Diagnosis (2007) is Gnomus' first studio recording.

2) Czech medieval band
The troop comprises of a number of rowdy musicians from the Elbe´s lowlands. Conjuring up strange and thunderous rhythmic musical productions. 

Let yourself be electrified by evil eyed rhythms and mystical melodies, forget your day-to-day worries and set out together with them into a time long past, both charming and unforgettable.
