Strange Talk are a synthpop band from Melbourne, Australia, consisting of Gerard Sidhu, Stephen Docker, Travis Constable and Gillan Gregory. The band was formed in February 2010 by friends Gerard and Stephen, who write both the lyrics and the music. Their sound has been likened to that of Cut Copy, Passion Pit, Phoenix and Yeasayer.

The band launched into the public eye when they rose to top as a feature artist during the 2010 Triple J Unearthed competition. In April 2011 they released their self-titled EP through Neon Gold Records and Fine Time Records which featured singles "Climbing Walls" and "Eskimo Boy".

The band reached number one on Billboard's Uncharted chart for 17 September 2011. As the music video that accompanies the tune reached almost 400,000 YouTube views between August and September. Strange Talk's debut studio album, Cast Away, was released on 8 February 2013 by Fine Time and Sony Music Australia. It charted at number fifty-six on the Australian Albums Chart.

The band have supported international acts The Rapture and Art vs. Science and performed alongside many others at Parklife, Good Vibrations, Playground Weekender, Future Music Festival, and Falls Festival. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Strange+Talk">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
