“That holy dream - that holy dream, While all the world were chiding, Hath cheered me as a lovely beam A lonely spirit guiding.”
Edgar Allan Poe – A Dream

Born out of years of thoughts and despair, the music of A Dream of Poe built itself around the main character of this play – Spell – shaping both towards an unseen future of musical sorrow.

Since 2005 the Azorean landscape has been, from time to time, surrounded by novel music from this solo project. Delirium Tremens was the first adventure into the unknown, digging deeper into it. .s creator…s soul and coming out with something new. A small demo, with just three tracks (one of wich was a cover from The Cure) was the hello ticket to a realm of doom. A new EP has been on the works since then, entitled Sorrow for the lost Lenore, with the release scheduled for 2009.

Even though this is a solo project, Spell has been accompanied by some guest musicians who have helped him to bring into this reality and life the musical poems he envisions. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/A+Dream+of+Poe">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
