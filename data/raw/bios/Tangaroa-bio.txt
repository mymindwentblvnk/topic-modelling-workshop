Tangaroa are a Progressive Death Metal Band from Leeds (UK) with an experimental side to them. Using 7 string guitars and a 6 string bass they managed to achieve an extremely heavy sound.

Taking their name from a Polynesian sea-god, Tangaroa are a truly unique hybrid of experimental extreme metal and progressive grind. An abhorrent amalgamation of virtuoso technical abilities and incendiary metal riffs that combine a wealth of styles from black metal, grindcore, hardcore and jazz, and push back the boundaries and concepts of song structures, offering a defiant middle finger response to the current wave of tech-metal pretenders to the throne.
