Biography:

We are a politically based technical death metal band from Pennsylvania. Our lyrics are a sweet and simple synopsis of current and past political events that have changed the way our government functions and how they have impacted our society; they are about the rising debt and secret bills passed through Congress that will abolish the Constitution entirely. 

We live in a world where the topic of politics and government is taboo or misunderstood by the people it affects the most. Our rights and freedoms are under cruel manipulations by our current political leaders and it's time that someone or something makes you, the people, aware.
