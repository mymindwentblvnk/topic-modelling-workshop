There is at least three bands / artists called Loose Ends.

1. One of the top British dance and urban contemporary trios in the early 1980s, Loose Ends formed in London, United Kingdom. They were originally called Loose End and included Carl McIntosh, Jane Eugene and Steve Nichol. Virgin signed them in 1981, and their début was written by Chris and Eddie Amoo. The group changed its name to Loose Ends in 1983 and signed with MCA in America in 1984. Their single 'Hanging on a String (Contemplating)' topped the R&B charts in 1985, and they repeated that achievement in 1986 with 'Slow Down'. Their last hit was 'Watching You' in 1988, which reached number two. The group shuffled its line-up in 1990 for the release of the album, Look How Long, with McIntosh now joined by Linda Carriere and Sunay Suleyman. McIntosh also produced several artists, notably Caron Wheeler.

2. Formed in Bexley Heath, Kent, United Kingdom, in late 1963, Loose Ends were led by singer Alan Marshall. By the time they landed a semi-residency at the Mayfair club, The Scotch of St. James (in February 1966) the group had signed to Decca. A July 1966 début single ('Send The People Away' b/w 'I Ain't Gonna Eat Out My Heart Anymore') while the group's soulful rendition of George Harrison's 'Taxman' curiously came out on 5 August 1966, the same day The Beatles' version came out on their 'Revolver' LP. The band fell apart in the autumn of 1966. Marshall assembled a new Loose Ends (with the aid of a Croydon band called The Subjects), while keyboardist Roy Davies and bassist Dave Collman formed a rival line-up, almost inevitably called New Loose Ends.

3. Loose Ends was an early / mid 1980s influenced hardcore punk band from central New Jersey, NJ. United States. Their first EP, 'Cut Loose', was released in 2011. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Loose+Ends">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
