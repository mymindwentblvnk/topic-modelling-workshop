Pulley is a Southern California punk rock formed in 1994. The band is known for straight-forward, hard-edged melodic punk. Pulley was formed upon vocalist Scott Radinsky's departure from Ten Foot Pole, brought about by that band's desire for a singer with a full-time focus on music (Radinsky is also a famous major-league relief pitcher and has played for the Los Angeles Dodgers among others). Pulley's initial lineup included drummer Jordan Burns, guitarist Jim Cherry, guitarist Mike Harder, and former Face to Face bassist Matt Riddle.

Pulley's debut, Esteem Driven Engine, was released in 1996 by Epitaph. Riddle joined No Use for a Name full-time soon afterwards and was replaced by Tyler Rebbe. Follow-ups included 60 Cycle Hum in 1997 and their eponymous third album in 1999.

They also released Together Again for the First Time (after the death of Jim Cherry) and Matters, both showing their disillusionment with the aging out of the 'old' scene. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pulley">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
