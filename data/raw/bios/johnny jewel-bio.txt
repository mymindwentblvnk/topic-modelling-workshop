Johnny Jewel is a producer and multi-instrumentalist. He is a co-founder of the label Italians Do It Better and is the producer behind Glass Candy, Desire, Symmetry, and Chromatics (post 2004).  

Jewel was enlisted to produce the score for the film "Drive".  However, the director's lack of creative control on the film resulted in most of it being scrapped.  Jewel ended up releasing the score as a 37-track album named "Themes for an Imaginary Film" under the name "Symmetry".  In 2012, Chromatics released the album "Kill For Love" produced by Jewel.
