From Blood&Ink:
Signed to Blood & Ink while still a project with an incomplete line-up, Revelation Through Tribulation serves as perfect evidence as to why we knew THIN ICE had to be a part of our family even then. Essentially a glorified demo, the songs that make up this debut EP barely scratch the surface of what these Texans have to offer. Coupling driving, gut-wrenching bass lines and devastating guitar riffs with powerful, yet heartfelt vocals, THIN ICE clearly have a knack for intense hardcore. Already drawing comparisons to the likes of Figure Four, Buried Alive, and Advent, this quintet is on the cusp of greatness.
