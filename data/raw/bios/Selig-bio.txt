Selig was founded in 1993 in Hamburg, Germany. The original members were singer Jan Plewka, bassist  Leo Schmidthals, guitarist  Christian Neander, drummer  Stephan "Stoppel" Eggert and keyboarder Malte Neumann.

Their first LP "Selig", a grungey album with hippie elements, was released in 1994. The singles "Sie hat geschrien" ("She Screamed") and "Wenn ich wollte" ("If I wanted to") entered the German charts almost immediately. 

In 1995 the second album "Hier" ("Here") was released. Its darker style was referred to by the band itself as hippie metal. The LP reached Germany's Top 20 Album Charts. The single releases "Ist es wichtig?" ("Does it matter?"), "Lass mich rein" ("Let Me In") and "Bruderlos"("Brotherless") all entered the billboard charts.

In 1997 the band released a more pop-orientated album named "Blender" ("Dazzler") and finally a best-of compilation "FÃ¼r immer und selig" ("Forever and Selig")
before disbanding in 1999.

In 2009 Selig reunited and released the new album "Und Endlich Unendlich" ("And Finally Infinite"). A new website has been put up at www.selig.eu.

Not even a year later, on 1. octobre 2010 they released the album Von Ewigkeit zu Ewigkeit ("From Eternity to Eternity"), which featured less ballads than "Und Endlich Unendlich" and showcased a more rockier and experimental approach.
