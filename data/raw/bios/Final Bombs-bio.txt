Strong willed japanese hardcore punk/heavy metal band with a great influence from Discharge's later singles and albums, "Warning", "The more I see" , "Ignorance", "Grave New World" and the likes. A total novelty sound among all the Discharge influenced bands, with plenty of slick solos, rhythmic hooks and a sick amount of distorsion and very little thrash or none, all kept at a steady and slightly slower pace than your usual HNSNSN worship sound but still fast, also the vocals being more melodic and a bit more high-pitched than shouted but not at all similar to the banshee-like screams of NWOBHM, delivering a political, peaceful, anti-war, tolerant, enviromentalist message or dealing with the apocalyptic aftermath in a more tranquil manner just like Cal envisioned Discharge in it's later period.
