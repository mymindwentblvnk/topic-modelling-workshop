HCOM was conceived in the grim underbelly of the motherland of Blackpool in 2005 and disbanded in early 2009. Originally formed as freeform drone/noise two piece "The Pink Mummies", their initial EPs were well received, so work began in 2007 on a full length album. Creating a sound akin to the Earth being pulled into a black hole, they were an oppressive, psychedelic and voluminous experience.
