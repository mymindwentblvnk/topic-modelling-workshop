Ancient Emblem was born from the passion for gloomy and raw sounds of 4 individuals which were coming from different past projects (Sejtan, Destierro, Annunaki Revenge, Crickbat, Justice Department, etc.) but with many points in common such as a strong believe in DIY as the only way for working as a band, and an even stronger hate for any authoritarian attitude which tries to dominate others, being human or not. We believe in a veg(etari)an way of life and we stand against all kinds of domination and discrimination  such as religion, homophobia, sexism, speciesism, racism, fascism or nazism. Maybe it sounds obvious for a kind of band like this, but sadly, strange times are running everywhere, even also in this community.
