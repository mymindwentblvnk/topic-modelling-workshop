Embers of Euphoria began its conception about three years ago by guitarist/vocalist Jesse Ramada, who began writing material and laying down scratch tracks. After songs were arranged and completed in early 2004, pre-production began and drums were tracked by Blood Eagle along with guitars and bass to follow completion later that year.

As time progressed, increased interest grew to complete the idea. With The Blood Eagle on drums and Jared Agius to take on the bass duties, Embers of Euphoria was still in need of a second guitarist and lead vocalist to fill in the slots. By Feburary 2005, Brenden Raye was asked to take on the vocal task with the addition of Mark Kazorowski to join shortly after to take on guitar number two. By March 2005, the band began giging. Around this time as well, the vocal tracks you hear on the demo were recorded by Brenden and Jes.

On April 21st of this year, the band did its last show with Brenden. The members of EoE wish him all the best and thank him for all the energy he put into the band while with us!
