2. Darren “Decoder” Beale is a musician, DJ and producer from bristol (UK) and part of the group Kosheen, alongside fellow DJ Markee “Substance” Morrisson and vocalist and songwriter Sian Evans. Both DJ’s have shared great success both with Kosheen and as solo DJ’s/Artists.

Beale started his career in 1991 using various aliases producing oldschool hardcore tracks such as "4 AM" which was one of the anthems of 1992. He continued fine tuning the deep jungle sound under the Orca and Koda aliases on Lucky Spin Records and its sister label, Deejay Recordings, releasing "Tranquility to Earth" in 1994. In 1995 he first used the Decoder pseudonym, pioneering the dark or 'techstep' style of drum & bass, often on Mark Caro's (Technical Itch) label Tech Itch Recordings.

1997 saw the release of Decoder’s ‘Decoded EP’. The release went on to become one of the most played tracks in the US’s drum and bass clubs and achieved press recognition with a number eighteen placing in N.M.E’s ‘Vibes Singles Of The Year’ chart. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Decoder">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
