Ambient black metal one-man band from Tasmania, Australia, formed by Sin Nanna in 1994.
Formerly Kathaaria (Aus).

The name is derived from "Stribog", the god of winds in Slavonic mythology. All winds and storms are said to be his grandsons ("stribozhi vnuci").
"Sin (Nanna)" is a Sumerian crescent moon god.

Finsternis Productions is Sin Nanna's own label.
