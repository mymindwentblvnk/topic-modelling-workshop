Born under the dim and nodding sky...


Nodding Sky got started in summer 2008 in Turku, Finland by a group of musicians passionate about and aspiring to create music they would all totally love to play.

Before Nodding Sky the band members have influenced in such Finnish bands as Silentium, Watch Me Fall and Strikin’ Case.

Originally their idea was to play cover songs in vein of i.e. Amorphis, Sentenced, Primordial and Opeth, but that got changed pretty soon as they realized the potential of their own material. The unique sound of Nodding Sky was quickly formed.

The style of Nodding Sky is their own mixture of melodic and progressive metal, blended with folk and rock elements and finished with a twist of harsh and sinister vocals.

Atmosphere is the most important ingredient of a Nodding Sky song, followed closely by natural flow and rocking groove. The band uses different vocal styles ranging from groans of death to harmonic clean singing. This adds up to a really tight rhythmic base for rough and melodic guitars.

Nodding Sky has performed frequently live around southern and central Finland since 2009. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nodding+Sky">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
