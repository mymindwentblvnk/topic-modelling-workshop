WINTERSIEGE was a project pioneered by James Storelli over the summer of 2008. Several songs had been written for the project, which was originally a doom metal project, with no electronica involved. However, David Pendergrass (_xE), after learning about the project via James' Facebook, approached James about Wintersiege, and offered to do drums and synths for him, fusing the art of metal and electronica together. James agreed, and the first recording session was held in David's basement using a condenser microphone and a small TEAC sound system. A demo, which is available for download off the website was released in late February 2009.  Another EP is planned for release in 2010.
