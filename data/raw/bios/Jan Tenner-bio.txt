Jan Tenner is a German Sci-fi audio play on tape produced between 1980 and 1989 by KIOSK. The final episode called "Mimo der RÃ¤cher" was released in 2000. Writer of the first six episodes was Dick Farlow (aka H. G. Francis), other episodes were done by Kevin Hayes (aka Horst Hoffmann). Both authors are known for their participation in the famous Perry Rhodan series.

Protagonist of the series that lasted 46 episodes is Jan Tenner, a student of physics. He is assisting Professor Futura and his assistant Laura (she first appeared in episode four and replaced a character called Tanja). General Forbett often joins the team in fights against the evil Professor Zweistein or different aggressive alien species such as the Leonen.

Kiddinx launched a revival of the series called "Jan Tenner: Die Neue Dimension" in 2001. Eleven episodes were released; production was stopped then due to bad sales. Currently, Kiddinx and VGH are re-releasing the 46 classic episodes on CD.
