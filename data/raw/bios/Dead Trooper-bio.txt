DEAD TROOPER BIOGRAPHY
Formed in 2002 in Oslo, Norway, by Morten Müller (DEATH INJECTOR, METAL MILITIA, ex-GRIMFIST) and Birger Larsen (GROTESQUE HYSTERECTOMY, METAL MILITIA, DEATH INJECTOR ex-GRIMFIST) together with then members Are Sorknes and Andreas Paulsen, DEAD TROOPER spent its formative years, like so many others, simply being a “Demo” band. Having released 3 demos in total, the band decided to leave behind its fledgling status in 2005 and released the “Spiritual Funeral” EP.  On the strength of this release DEAD TROOPER was invited to tour with SUSPERIA, thereby gaining the perfect platform from which to introduce the band to audiences all over Europe, who, it has to be said, enthusiastically welcomed the Norwegian Thrashers.  

Whilst two of the original members left, both Müller and Larsen, who had by now been playing together under various metal incarnations for several years, knew they had a good thing going with DEAD TROOPER and added the formidable drumming talents of Jon Eirik Bokn (ZEROZONIC, BREED, AUTUMN INSPIRATION) and bassist Tor R. Stavenes (1349, PANTHEON I, DEN SAAKALDTE) to the line up. The release of the debut full-length album “Cynisist” in 2009 and the “Sickening” EP in 2010 followed, earning the band critical acclaim from both fans and press.   In 2012 “No Tan En Vivo En Mexico”, a live album with a bit of a difference, was released digitally.  The eight track album was inspired by the band’s appearance at Mexico’s Wild Metal Fest the previous year, which was rained off after only one and a half songs into the set. The band decided to release a live studio recording of what would have been the entire show as a tribute to the fans who took Dead Trooper to their hearts after they performed an impromptu set at a local biker bar following the cancellation of the festival.  DEAD TROOPER is currently working on the band’s next  full length album which will be titled “Erector”, and includes a formidable array of guests, all bearing witness to the reputation and standing that the band has now attained.  
But all you really need to know is that DEAD TROOPER has a line up that combines impressive musical skills and a whole lot of experience, both live and in the studio, with an abundance of enthusiasm, charisma and high energy to produce the kind of “groovy, aggressive thrash metal” that has won them fans and friends not just close to home, but also as far afield as South America.  And by the looks of it, this is most definitely set to continue!
