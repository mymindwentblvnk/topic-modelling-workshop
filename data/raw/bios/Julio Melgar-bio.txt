Julio Melgar was born October 16, 1972 in the department of Escuintla in Guatemala, he knows the Lord Jesus at the age of ten years and since then serves God with all your heart

In 1994, Julio Melgar along with several friends formed a new ministry, which is made up of musicians and singers who serve within their respective churches and together serve the Church of Christ.

With a desire to inspire people of all races, generations and cultures, restoring worship right through the intimate communion with God, Julio and his band began mixing sounds and genres to create music that breaks barriers and defies all schemes and classification. Together with his team of musicians and singers, Julio utilizes the diversity of musical tastes, as a reference point for creating each of his songs. What does July has nothing to do nothing else with musical genres and rhythms but with "a new sound coming from the heart of God that transforms, heals, defies and marks the lives."

Consistently, Julio and his team of musicians traveled extensively in Guatemala and also his country in other nations while serving in his local church in which he is pastor.

Julio has a recording called "Day of Pentecost" and now presents its new project called "I believe in you" which is the result of believing every word that came out of the mouth of God, we can see the reflection of God's promise fulfilling an outstanding and amazing, "I believe in you" is an album that has 13 songs written mostly by July, which are a mixture of different styles like gospel, funk, alternative rock, disco, reggae, punk, R & B, but the interesting thing is that it is a project full of God's presence that marked a new era in the life of the people who will listen. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Julio+Melgar">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
