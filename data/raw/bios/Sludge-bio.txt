In the early nineties was born what is known nowadays as the heaviest band from Switzerland: SLUDGE
Influenced by the dark atmosphere and heaviness of bands like Celtic Frost, Samael, Cathedral or Entombed… SLUDGE recorded their first EP "Sweet Daisy" with Tomas Skogsberg (Entombed, Dismember, Grave, Tiamat, Hellacopters...) at the Sunlight studios from Stockholm in 1996.
With the support of Lee dorian from Cathedral, this EP was released worldwide through Godhead Records (Acrimony), and started to spread the bands name.
They went back to the Sunlight Studios in the end of 1997 to record their first and darkest LP album "The Well".
Released through Headstrong Records in 1998, this album received the interest from Xy (Samael) and was followed by gigs accross Europe, featuring some cool supporting acts for bands like :
MACHINE HEAD, ENTOMBED, CATHEDRAL, SAMAEL, CROWBAR, TESTAMENT, DIE KRUPPS, ANATHEMA, STUCK MOJO, SPIRITUAL BEGGARS, …
As they wanted to reproduce the way they sound "live", they recorded 8 songs by themselves in their rehearsal-room at the end of 1999. The result of this « painful » experience was mixed by Fredrik Nordström (Dimmu Borgir, The Haunted, In Flames, At the Gates…) in two days at the famous Fredman Studios (Gothenburg) in January 2000.
The album : « SCARECROW MESSIAH » received a great response from european-press  (Metal Hammer 6/7 - Metal Heart 9/10 - Legacy 13/15) and after the shooting of a video from the song « Scarecrow Messiah», they made about 60 shows in one year including a full and succesfull european tour with CROWBAR in may/june 2001.
After this, the band took a small break when guitar player Makro started to play as official member of swiss black metal legend : SAMAEL.
Finally the band went back in a « real » studio in early 2004 to record his coldest and most efficient album « Yellow Acid Rain ».
Recorded in one week in Switzerland and produced by Makro, the mix has been once again handled by Fredrik nordström in april 2004.
This will also mark the collaboration with danish extreme metal company "MIGHTY MUSIC" which signed the band for a worldwide deal.
After ten years spent together, the band parted ways with former singer Nik and bass player Picasso. This will mark the arrival of the new eastern forces in the band known as Odin on vocals (Houston swing engine, Unfold) and Ulik (ukrainian destroyer) on bass.
 
From here the band will spit "LAVA"
 
Something unique/ never heard before, something burning and freezing in the same time..
Dirty, un-commercial, un-compromised, heavy as shit..
 
Produced by Makro, mixed by Serge Morattel (Knut, Nostromo, Shora) and mastered by Alan Douches (Mastodon, Converge.)
 
Nothing else to say..
