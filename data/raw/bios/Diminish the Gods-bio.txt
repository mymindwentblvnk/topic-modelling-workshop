DIMINISH THE GODS is a five piece technical/progressive death metal band from Sydney, Australia. 

Taking inspiration from bands such as Within The Ruins and Conducting From The Grave, Diminish The Gods have forged a sound of their own. Technical melodic patterns intertwine in chaotic progression, before plunging into brutal rhythm structures and breakdowns. 

Working with Parallel Focus Studios USA engineer Julian Rodriguez and 301 Studios Simon Cohen, Diminish The Gods have completed the first 5 installments of their first release, available now. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/DIMINISH+THE+GODS">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
