ENGINE-V was formed in 1998 in Athens by George Laitmer (vocals, guitar), Panos Tomaras (bass) and Costas Petrou (drums). Between 1991 and 1996, Laitmer and Tomaras played in Honeydive, a successful Alternative/Grunge band that released an album and two E.P.'s. Tomaras is also a member of The Earthbound.

ENGINE-V developed a rich, tight, contemporary, unique sound. Although influenced by a number of bands, their songs were distinctive and hard hitting.

In 1999 ENGINE-V recorded the self-released «Budgie E.P.», which was mainly distributed at gigs and sold out immediately. ENGINE-V continued to perform live, appearing alongside Swedish stoner-rockers Dozer and Spiritual Beggars, and Greek bands, such as Nightstalker, Deus Ex Macina, Closer and The Earthbound. The band developed a dedicated fan base and was included in the Rockwave Festival 2001 line-up.

In early 2002 ENGINE-V played with Fu Manchu from the U.S. and The International Noise Conspiracy from Sweden, while recording their debut album, «BROKEN WORLD», which was completed in late 2003.

In 2004, one track, the powerful «No More», appeared in the compilation album «Athens Calling», alongside well-known Greek bands, like Nightstalker and Deus ex Macina.

In January 2005 Costas Papaspyrou joined the band on guitar, adding more sonic power to their live sound.
«BROKEN WORLD», the long-awaited debut album by ENGINE-V , is out on March 2005 on Mad Prophet Records.
