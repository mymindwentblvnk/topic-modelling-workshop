It was October of 2000 when four rebellious schoolmates Con, Rain, Orb and Orav from a small Estonian town called Otepää united their forces and created the beast titled Mortophilia. Thes guys didn't knew how to play but they were sure that they want to play Brutal Death Metal. Cannibal Corpse, Deicide and Death are the keywords.
