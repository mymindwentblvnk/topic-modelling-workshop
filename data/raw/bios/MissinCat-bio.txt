MissinCat is a singer-songwriter based in Berlin, Germany. She played for six years as the bassist of the Italian pop rock band Vertigini, with which she released a record and toured all over Italy. In December 2006, under the moniker of MissinCat, Caterina Barbieri founded her solo project. From the beginning she imagined her songs being extremely minimal and intense, accompanied by simple acoustic guitars and little else. In June 2007, MissinCat won the prize of the biggest Italian summer festival, Heineken Jammin Festival: a chance to perform on stage with artists like Incubus and Pearl Jam. The Heineken Jammin Festival also sponsored the recordings of her first album. In summer 2007, MissinCat met Carlos Fleishmann from the Berlin-based booking agency Creative Talent and started working with him. In October, she performed as the opening act of Amy Winehouse in all the German shows of her European tour. In the meantime, she went into the studio to start working on her first album, where she had a hands-on experience in arranging and producing her music herself. In December 2007, she finished the recordings of her album, as well as continuing to gig successfully in Berlin. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/MissinCat">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
