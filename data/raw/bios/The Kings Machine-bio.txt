This band was formed when Gemini was going through some problems. The name of the band comes from lyrics of the Gemini song Out for Blood. 

This band includes Lance King who was the lead singer on the first two albums by Pyramaze. He was also on Empire's first album (tracks 2, 4-7, 10-12), Balance of Power's first 4 albums, Avian's first 2 albums, and Defyance's 2002 album. He is also the founder of Nightmare Records Which he still Runs.
