Cromonic - The band of doom and destruction!

The story began in the autumn of 2004 with guitarist Patrik von Porat and bass player Bo Pettersson. At this point there was only ideas and song material. Vocalist Pasi Humppi was recruited and the promotion CD-single “Rebirth” was recorded from which the band received great response. The band was split up and songwriter and guitarist Patrik von Porat decided to go along with the project alone. Now it's a one man army. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cromonic">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
