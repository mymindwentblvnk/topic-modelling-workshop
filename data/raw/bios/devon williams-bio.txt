Devon Williams is an accomplished singer/song writer from Los Angeles, California. His career started through playing in the So-Cal punk band, Osker. After Osker split-up, Devon started another project on his own, called Lung Fa Tang. Releasing one mp3 on a small website for the group. The group soon gained momentum with shows and a name change, Fingers-Cut, Megamachine!. Releasing a 7" under Aggravated Music, they got their start. Soon they were going on tour and traveling as far as they could. After releasing their Self-titled Debut on Thick Records, as well as an EP ("Pipe Dreams"), the band slowed down a bit. Devon got back to basics by releasing a cd under his own name on a past tour. Devon was recently playing guitar in the band Lavender Diamond. Williams released a two-song (of the two, one song has a "music video") 7" record on L.A. Records. His full length "Carefree" (also referred to as "Careerfree") was released on Ba-Da Bing! Records in April of 2008. In May of 2009, Carefree was released on Cassette Tape via Burger Records. The tape included new songs and other bonus content.
