Ed Gein is a three piece band from Syracuse, NY, which formed in 2001. Each of the three members (guitar, drums, and bass) shared vocal duties equally on the first two albums (It's a Shame a Family Can Be Torn Apart by Something as Simple as a Pack of Wild Dogs and Judas Goats and Dieseleaters). Drummer Jesse Daino later decided that he no longer wanted to contribute vocals and the vocal parts will be split between guitarist Graham Reynolds and bassist Aaron Jenkins on the upcoming album, Bad Luck.

The band has been pounding the pavement hard since their formation in 2001, touring furiously and earning themselves a cult-like following across the US and Canada. Playing a hybrid style of thrash, metal, sludge, grind and punk, Ed Gein, who call Syracuse, NY home, use their self-described "angry-noise punk" style as a means to deliver their politically and socially charged message. "It's all a matter of being aware and thinking for yourself," says Jenkins. "A 'Judas-goat' is an older animal at a slaughter-house trained to lead the other animals to slaughter. In exchange, the animal is taken care of almost like a family pet until they are no longer of use. A large portion of the world's population falls into one of the unfortunate categories of either being a betrayer or one of the millions of mindless, resource-eating followers."


The band takes influence from such bands as Coalesce and Pig Destroyer. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ed+Gein">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
