Combining the raw, powerful rage of blackened death metal with the finesse and adroit, technical artistry of progressive death metal, Apothys has begun its quest in penning a new chapter in the metal grimoire with their trademark Blackened Progressive Death metal style. 

Initially forming as the brainchild of Carrion Misery and Eddie Misery, Apothys has grown through the addition of permanent members Mace, Isaac and Pyr to become the definitive Blackened Progressive Death metal band. It is in the shape of this new and terrible monster that Apothys released its 2009 EP Advent: Doom to exceptional acclaim worldwide, most notably by long-time reviewer and metal polyglot, Baz of MetalStorm fame, who gave this self-funded and locally produced EP a rating of 8.8. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Apothys">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
