KAOTEON (Kaotik Eon) began in 1998/9 as a one man band by Anthony (Kaos). About mid 2000, Walid (Wolflust) was summoned to do the vocals and different members were tried out afterwards but never lasted due to the lack of local talent or dedication. 

KAOTEON started effective work in 2003 after losing hope in finding adequate members for the job so they dropped older composed material, and worked on the debut demo "Provenance of Hatred" which was recorded on january 2004 in a single take at a home made studio with sessionist drummer Riad doing just a couple of practices prior to the recording as he lived in france back then and on february 2004 the demo was released by several Labels/Distros all over the world and is still getting a great feedback. 

The band worked with many drummers in 2005 some of which are Romain (ex- imperial sodomy, ex- Belef, Agressor (fra)) for 3 months but the guy left all his bands seeking different plans and Mikael (Kronos) which was a great fit, alas, he started a new job and things didn't work out at last... 

Anyway, the band is in constant search for a killer drummer to work with even if he lives abroad but can record the material and do one hell of a job... 

Nowadays, KAOTEON has several new songs composed that will be compiled into a full length as soon as possible and maybe it gets to be released on some mature respected label.
