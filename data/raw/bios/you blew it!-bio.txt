You Blew It! were an emo band from Orlando, FL. Their sound draws heavily from the midwest/Chicago sound of bands such as Cap'n Jazz, American Football, and Braid. On April 24th, 2012 the band released their debut LP, Grow Up, Dude. Following a series of rave reviews and snappy one-liners, the band embarked on the first of many tours that included performances at FEST. Nearly two years and a couple members later, the Blew Its released their follow-up record, Keep Doing What You're Doing.

Their EP is available for choose-your-price download from the band's bandcamp. Myspace is SO 2005.
