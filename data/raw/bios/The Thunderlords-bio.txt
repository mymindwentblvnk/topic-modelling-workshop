What would happen if The Wiggles met Rob Zombie backstage at a Gwar concert and decided to form a band together? I'm not really sure, but I'd bet they would sound a lot like The Thunderlords! The Thunderlords play loud, heavy music with goofy, fun lyrics that everyone can enjoy. Except those looking for some peace and quiet.

The Thunderlords are an American parody rock band consisting of one member. They describe themselves as "The First Heavy Metal Band for Kids!".

They are known best for their songs "I Like Dirt" and "Ice Cream Headache" on the soundtracks for the bestselling video games Tony Hawk's American Wasteland and Tony Hawk's Project 8. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Thunderlords">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
