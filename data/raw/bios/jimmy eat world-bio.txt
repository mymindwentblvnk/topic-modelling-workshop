Jimmy Eat World is an alternative rock band formed in Mesa, Arizona, United States, in 1993. The band is composed of lead guitarist/lead vocalist Jim Adkins, drummer Zach Lind, rhythm guitarist/vocalist Tom Linton, and bassist Rick Burch. Jimmy Eat World has released ten studio albums, the last nine featuring the current lineup.

The four-piece's commercial breakthrough came with the successful release of several singles from the album Bleed American (2001). Four singles from the album charted within the Top 20 positions of the Alternative Songs chart, with "The Middle" reaching the #1 position. Jimmy Eat World's follow-up album Futures (2004) featured another Alternative number one song, "Pain". The RIAA certified Bleed American platinum and Futures gold, rewarding the two albums for selling over one and a half million records between them.
