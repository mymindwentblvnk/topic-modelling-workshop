Spawning from the hostile Northwest, Panzergod has risen to rekindle the ancient unholy flame of truly cold and monumental black metal in the tradition of the old ones. Born from the ashes of long since past blasphemies, Lord Andross and Grond Nefarious conceived this atrocity of steel in the frozen ice storm of Portland OR, winter 2002. Since then, the hate and nihilism has boiled and spilled forth in the form of several demos and a handful of memorable ceremonies of sorrow, cast forth on an unsuspecting world.

Through years of creativity and solitude, the founding members became increasingly displeased with failing members and thus went even further underground. No longer finding interest in playing live, but rather continuing to write and record in the cold necro stench that brought inspiration in the beginning.

Through long time comrades in various other projects, 2008 brought a breath of decay back into Panzergodâ€™s live assault in the form of bass performed by General Malleus, as well as rounding out the chainsaw section with the Goatlord taking on second guitar duties. This latest and most barbaric incarnation of the band has seen some of the most brutal rehearsals to date, as well as the seething new EP, Ceremonies of Sorrow Begin, the first to include the full band line up.

As the past drifts further away, none shall be allowed to forget that the armored fist of Satan will rain down and the Panzergod will reign triumphant! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Panzergod">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
