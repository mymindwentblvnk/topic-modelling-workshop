Our Days Are Numbered are a new Suffolk Pop-Hard Core band. At the heart of ambient melodies, brutal breakdowns and crushing chorus's are five dedicated young hopefuls, who are keen to travel the UK one town at a time, and unify fans through their slam pits and bouncy pop chorus's. 

The band will be recording their debut E.P at the end of July and are out to gain local fame before hitting the UK circuit. Since their first home town show these lads have been working behind the scenes of their first merch line, numerous local shows and refining their set. 

ODAN promise a career that will focus on writing honest music, playing heartfelt shows, and always being in it for the laughs. The band stand by a modest career path - 

"To proudly accept any opportunity that will take us further, bringing us closer to sharing stages with the country's most beloved bands. We want our music to inspire and captivate our audiences, as without their gratitude we would have no motivation. Seeing just one face light up, screaming their lungs to death and jumping till their feat are sore, is how we know we've done a great job."
