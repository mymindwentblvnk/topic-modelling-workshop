Nonsakrum is hardcore/metal band that started playing few years ago somewhere in highlands of southern Poland. Music is quite simple - sometimes fast and furious, sometimes slow and heavy. All lyrics are in polish to keep message fresh and clear to polish audience. People who don't understand polish, may consider them as part of folklore and trust that they're good and usually positive (anti-totalitarian, anti-religious etc.).
Mateusz - vocal, Radek - vocal, Daniel - bass, Jarek - guitar, Hubert - drums. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nonsakrum">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
