Himera is the persona of Latvian-born, Ireland-based producer Daniel Masterov. Producing since a young age, Himera has been inspired by the underground rave culture of Eastern Europe and early 2000s soundscapes to create an energetic and surreal trance experience.

Gaining attention with a remix of Charli XCX's Unlock It, signing to aurawire in early 2019, and co-signs from PC Music's Hannah Diamond and Laura Les, Himera is one of the most talented and quickest growing musicians in the underground electronic scene, being touted by Ersa Magazine as a "techno teenage wonder". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/himera">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
