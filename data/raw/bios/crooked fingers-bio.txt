Crooked Fingers is an American alt-folk band based in North Carolina and led by former Archers of Loaf lead singer Eric Bachmann. The rotation of band members has included such musicians as Lara Meyerratken, R.L. Martin, Jo Jameson, Barton Carroll and Dov Friedman.

In 1998, following the breakup of Archers of Loaf, Bachmann started work on a solo project that he named Crooked Fingers. The first outcome of this project, a self-titled release of various songs he had written, was released by WARM in 2000. It was followed shortly after by a second album on WARM, Bring on the Snakes. Reservoir Songs EP, a collection of covers of songs by artists such as Neil Diamond and Queen, was released on the Merge label in 2002. Red Devil Dawn followed in 2003, and Dignity and Shame in 2005.
