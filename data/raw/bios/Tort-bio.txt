Old school doom/sludge/thrash metal influenced by bands like Hellhammer, Sleep, Black Sabbath, Saint Vitus, High on Fire and Eyehategod.

The band was formed in Barcelona in 2009 when Ivan Roman (The Eyes, Warchetype, Cuzo) on bass  and Sergio Sancho (Camposanto, Taunus, Cuerno, Lords of Bukkake) on lead guitar were bored of playing slow and "sad" doom metal and decided to create a new metal band to play faster. The band had some line-up changes during the first few months of their existence; the drummer Pep Caravante joined, but both Ivan Roman and Pep were later replaced by Laurent Py Cazals and Michel Angel Serrano (La Matanza, Morbid Flesh, Diseased, Castro, Cuerno).

Their s/t debut was released by TotalRust in 2011.
