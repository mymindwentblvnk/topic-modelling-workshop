He originates from a small town called Handel in the province of Noord-Brabant in the southern Netherlands, but now resides in London, after spending multiple years living in Ireland.

Inspired by artists such as Damien Jurado and Bon Iver, Van der Ven performed as the support act for The Boxer Rebellion, The Staves, Bon Iver, Bear's Den, Joan As Policewoman and Lisa Hannigan, amongst others. In 2016 Bear's Den invited him along on tour as a touring band member. He played major European festivals with them, including Glastonbury, Rock Werchter and Pinkpop.

Meanwhile, he continued to work on his solo d√©but LP, Empty Handed, which (after the Love's Glory and Montreal EPs, both released as Christof) was released in April 2018. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Christof+van+der+Ven">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
