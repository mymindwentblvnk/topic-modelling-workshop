Abimaro is a London-based singer-songwriter with an eclectic sonic palette that is hard to box in. From the delicacy of "Folding" to the vibrancy of her latest single "Parasols," her breadth of ability has led to being handpicked for collaborations with the likes of Zero 7 and Cinematic Orchestra. She is currently working on her first album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Abimaro">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
