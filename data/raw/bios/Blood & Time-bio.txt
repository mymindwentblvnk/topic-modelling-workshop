Scott Kelly and Neurosis bandmate, Noah Landis, with help from Anthony Nelson, have created a staggering, stark work that will survive long after their forms are reduced to dust. It seems that this was evident to them and weighed heavily in the process of creating their first record. At The Foot Of The Garden is remarkable for its honesty alone. It is so deeply personal that it makes one a bit uncomfortable.

Like all things Neurosis, it is amazingly dark without being pretentious. It is heavy without sonic volume. The ten songs here fumble naked through darkened corridors and beg to be heard. Each note plods along moving inch by inch towards your heart, not terribly unlike the band's name... Blood & Time. The songs are more like confessions, and whispered secrets, songs that are years of profound sorrow slowly exhaling as Scott Kelly settles into what will be the rest of his life. That makes the record comforting after being uncomfortable. After watching Neurosis mature over the years, Blood & Time just seems to fit into the equation. A moving testament to human endurance and humility.

Blood & Time have also released an album of live recordings inside Southern Records studios for the infamous Latitudes series simply called "Untitled".
