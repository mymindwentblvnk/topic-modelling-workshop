Besargian, as a concept, began in late 2003 when founding member, Matt Zuchowski decided to channel his love of traditional doom metal such as Black Sabbath, and Candlemass into a living, breathing project.

During this period, some music was written, but nothing recorded. It was not until early 2004, that the band truly began to take shape. At this point, a bass player was brought on, and a short, three track demo, entitled 'Doom What Thou Wilt' was recorded (however, only Matt played on this demo).

Currently, Besargian are writing songs for a full-length, and actively seeking guest, or permanent vocalists to sing on the new tracks.

Besargian's lineup consists of Matt Zuchowski (guitars/vocals/drum programming), and Cory Crete (bass/keyboards). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Besargian">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
