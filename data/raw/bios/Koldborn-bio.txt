Koldborn is a danish band who plays groovy and grinding death metal. The band has it roots back in 1997, when the drummer Rasmus, and guitarist Heinz from Icon Of Sin formed the band. When they had their lineup, they recorded the demo "Blessed By Beyond" which gave them their contract with the danish label Diehard Music. 
The debut album was called "First Enslavement" which was recorded in their own studio, and produced by Jacob Bredahl. 
After the release of the debut album, Heinz joined Hatesphere, where he still plays guitar today.

In 2004 they released the EP called "The Devil Of All Deals", where the new vocalist Lars amazed with his powerful voice and sense for catchy hook lines.
After the EP, the band started working on the just released full length-cd "The Uncanny Valley" which was released in october. The new record is extremely catchy, groovy and brutal. "The Uncanny Valley" was also produced by Jacob Bredahl at Smart N' Hard. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Koldborn">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
