Dome is a name of at least two acts:

1) A duo of Wire members: Bruce Gilbert and Graham Lewis (aka B.C.Gilbert・G.Lewis and Cupol). Gilbert & Lewis formed the duo during Wire's 1980–1984 hiatus and débuted with the album "Dome" (1980, Dome Records - aka "Dome 1").
Other album releases include: "Dome 2" (1980, Dome Records), "Dome 3" (1981, Dome Records), "Will You Speak This Word" (1982, Uniton - aka "Dome 4"), and their latest album, "Yclept" (1999, WMO).

As well as releasing Dome albums, Gilbert & Lewis also produced and released records by Desmond Simmons (who plays on Colin Newman's solo albums A-Z and Not To) and Angela Conway (aka A.C. Marias), on the Dome label.
The 3R4 LP was released in 1980, followed by the Kluba Cupol EP and Ends With The Sea 7", all on the 4AD Records label. In 1982 they released MZUI (Waterloo Gallery), an LP of recordings make at Waterloo Gallery with Russell Mills.

In 1983 the duo teamed up with Dome collaborator Angela Conway to release the Whilst Climbing Thieves Vie For Attention LP under the name P'o. In that year they also released the Or So It Seems LP under the name Duet Emmo (an anagram of 'Dome' and 'Mute'), with Daniel Miller, head of Mute Records.

After Wire's 1984 reformation, Dome continued to occasionally perform and record.


2) A romanisation of โดม, a pseudonym of of Thai / German / Singaporean model / singer / DJ ปกรณ์ ลัม (b. 1979 - aka Dome Pakorn Lum), who débuted with the album "Dome" (1996 - aka Dome Pakorn Lum's "Dome").

Lum began his modelling career at six years old.

Other album releases include: "Dangerous Dome" (1998 - aka Dome Pakorn Lum's "Dangerous Dome"), "Question" (1999 - aka "Dome Question", โดม's "Question" and Dome Pakorn Lum's "Question") and "Naked" (2001 - aka Dome Pakorn Lum's "Dome Naked", โดม's "Naked", โดม's "Dome Naked" and Dome Pakorn Lum's "Naked").
