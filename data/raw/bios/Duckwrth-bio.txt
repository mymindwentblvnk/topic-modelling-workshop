DUCKWRTH is one of the west coast's most dynamic up-and-coming artists of this generation.  Clearly a student of hip hop, DUCKWRTH's creative style is an amalgamation of seminal acts like The Pharcyde and Tribe Called Quest with dashes of Gnarls Barkley and Outkast. Yet, he is maintaining a decidedly unique element that solidifies his role as a major player in the progression of Hip Hop as a cerebral art form. He is breathing new life into reminiscent hip-hop that true heads have loved and have gladly seen triumph to mainstream stardom.
 
DUCKWRTH was born and raised in South Central Los Angeles and has resided and called San Francisco home for some time now.  He models himself as an all around artist appearing in photos for indie clothing brand Rare Panther to ads for Levis and Facebook.   A true lover of creativity without limits, he expresses himself through his story telling lyrics, video directing, photography, and graphic design as part of an art collective called ThemHellas and his own graphic design company BluuDragon.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Duckwrth">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
