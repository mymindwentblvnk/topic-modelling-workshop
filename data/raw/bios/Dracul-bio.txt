Dracul stands for club-compatible gothic electro and is the side-project of Umbra Et Imago frontmen Mozart and Lutz Demmler, it was founded in 1994. the first release of DRACUL was in the same year, named "Die Hand Gottes". As has become tradition for Dracul, Lutz and Mozart again asked guest musicians and vocalists to contribute to their latest release "Like An Animal": Tobias Birkenbeil provided any classical arrangements as well as vocals for one track; London-based recording artist and DJ Lahannya wrote and performed the vocals for two tracks and Nanne from the Umbra et Imago live team provided the female counterpoint to Mozart's charismatic voice on several tracks. The combination of different songwriting styles and voices resulted in a varied but club-friendly 4th album for Dracul, which is characterised by themes ranging from political criticism to vampire romance.
