Bad Intention - a guarantee for straight, clean and melodic rock music. These three guys from Bremen combine a number of different rock styles and, thus, create their own special style of sound. Catchy melodies and thrilling rhythms are their songs' attributes. 

Following an early live premiere (supporting well known German rock acts like Mad Doggin' and Seng:Fu) only five weeks after the band was founded, Bad Intention spent a lot of time in their rehearsal rooms in the Audio Basement Studios in order to compose as much songs as possible. Meanwhile, the guys wrote fifteen own songs, whereof four were recorded during rehearsal sessions and further three have been recorded in demo quality at a friend's studio. 

Recently, the mission live presence was gone about and a number of club gigs ranging from 50 to 400 listeners were played. The audiences' reactions proved evidence that Bad Intention live is an all-round energetic show that makes it hard to elude. Whereas the guys keep on writing songs, the search for more gigs is continued... got one?
