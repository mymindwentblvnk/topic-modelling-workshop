First Amendment began as the solo keyboard project of Abhay Singh in 2003 and was founded as a “band” when Mark Nelsen joined as drummer in the fall. For a year and a half, the two of them recorded three demos with Nelsen playing both drums and guitar. They began to look for a third member because Nelsen couldn’t fulfill both guitar and drum duties if they were to play live. Alex Rowson joined as drummer of the band in January 2005. The band played their first two shows at Singh’s house in the summer and began recording a more professional demo with George Rosenthal in the fall.
