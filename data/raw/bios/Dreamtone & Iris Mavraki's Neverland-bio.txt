Dreamtone & Iris Mavraki's Neverland is a music group, a collaboration between Turkish progressive metal band Dreamtone and Greek singer Iris Mavraki. Commonly abbreviated as "Neverland", their music can be best described as Symphonic power metal.

In 2004, Neverland's former manager Orpheus Spiliotopoulos listened to Dreamtone's first demo, Unforeseen Reflections and later introduced the band and Iris Mavraki to each other. Throughout the writing and composing stages of the songs, Iris was in Greece and Dreamtone were in Turkey. During this time, they recorded a collection of demos (two of which are on the special edition of the band's first CD). On December 2007, Neverland signed their first record contract with AFM Records and set out to record their debut album, Reversing Time.

Teaming up with the guest artists Hansi Kürsch, Tom Englund, Gary Wehrkamp and Mike Baker, they recorded the band's first 12 tracks. The album was released in February 2008 after visiting 8 studios before finalized. Also during Hansi Kürsch's recording sessions, the recordings had to be rescheduled six times and cancelled once due to various reasons, from touring to storms destroying studio rooftops. Mike Baker, the recently deceased singer, reserved the track Reversing Time when he first heard it, without a second thought. This track was his final officially released singer appearance and ironically the song is about a person trying to reverse the time and stop his death.

In 2010 the band released their second album Ophidia.
