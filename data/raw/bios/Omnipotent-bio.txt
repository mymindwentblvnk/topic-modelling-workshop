Omnipotent is the project of William Inamorata and Pete Peters. Around the time of its conception, Omnipotent was joined by a collection of people on backing vocals and precussion instruments, affectionatly refered to as The Gang. Omnipotent songs are usually covers of well known songs such as "Sympathy for the Devil" and "Hey Jude", though, for friend and founding member of The Gang, Jordan Blunkett's birthday, a few instrumental tracks called Classical Edge, Happy Jordan Day, Sad Jordan Day and Strawberry Jam were produced.

Their most recent album, Sophie Day, was recorded on June 14, and only features three proper songs, the rest being rather disappointing experimentations and short snippets of speech. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Omnipotent">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
