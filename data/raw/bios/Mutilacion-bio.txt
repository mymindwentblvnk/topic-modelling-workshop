Mutilacion crawled out of the grave in 2005 to bring necromancy and death metal into flawless union.

 The aura of Death has manifested in several live performances. Bringing a complete ritual for all those who have the eyes to see.

 In 2009 Mutilacion unleashed their "From the Abode of Endless Darkness" EP, the band's first elaborate work in auditory madness. Through this release we were able to establish the Cult of Death in new territorries bringing the light of darkness to new ears and eyes. 

 2012 saw the tomb open to the second release 'Fires of Death's Arcanum', a dark manifesto exploring the rites and veneration of the let handed aspects of the Lord of Death. With this release and our live artillery we aim to establish ourselves in the Death Metal hierarchy and drown deeper in our thirst for the unknown.

 BEHOLD THE FIRES OF BLACKENING DOOM!
