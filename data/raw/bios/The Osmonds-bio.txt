The Osmonds are an American family pop group who achieved enormous worldwide success as teenage music idols in the 1970s.

The group originally comprised brothers Alan Ralph Osmond (born June 22, 1949), (Melvin) Wayne Osmond (born August 28, 1951), Merrill Davis Osmond (born April 30, 1953), Jay Wesley Osmond (born March 2, 1955) and Donny (Donald) Clark Osmond (born December 9, 1957). They were later joined by younger siblings (Olive) Marie Osmond (born October 13, 1959) and Jimmy (James) Arthur Osmond (born April 16, 1963).

Older brothers George Virl Osmond, Jr. (born October 19, 1945), and Thomas Rulon Osmond (born October 26, 1947) were born deaf and did not appear on any of the records. In 1966, they made their performing debut with their siblings on Andy Williams Show, though they didn't come around much again until the Donny and Marie Show and The Osmond Family Show. 

Health: Alan has suffered from MS for some years. Wayne had a brain tumor and had to have a practically life-saving operation. Merrill has had different problems through the years, including but not limited to depression, heart attack, and diabetes. Donny has social panic attacks and Marie has depression also. Jimmy had a stroke. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Osmonds">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
