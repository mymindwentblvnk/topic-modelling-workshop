Imminent is the alter-ego of rhythmic noise/technoid producer Olivier Moreau, and is the natural continuation of his Imminent Starvation project.  This name change was commemorated in 1999 with the destruction of his mixing desk, pieces of which were included with the limited version of "Nord." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/imminent">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
