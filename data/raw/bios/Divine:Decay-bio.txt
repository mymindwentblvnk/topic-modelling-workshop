Though they were only founded in 1999, Finland's Divine Decay worship at the altar of '80s Bay Area thrash -- particularly crunch-meisters Testament.
Both of their albums, 2001's Songs of the Damned and 2003's Maximize the Misery, were released by French label Osmose, and feature vocalist Alec Hirst-Gee, guitarists Paul Pale (also of Hecate Enthroned) and Timo Nyberg (second album only, also of Gandalf), bassist Toni Gr√∂nros (of Am I Blood), and drummer Juhuna Rantala (H.I.M.). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Divine:decay">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
