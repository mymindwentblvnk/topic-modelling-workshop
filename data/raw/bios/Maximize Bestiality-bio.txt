Maximize Bestiality was founded in 2011 by Marty and Dr. Faust. After a short time Thorso joined as a second guitar player. Analex followed as the guttural machine. After a successful replacement show for the brutal deathers of Orphalis they started recording the first demo/ep in 2012. Thorso left the band in late 2012 to realize his own project. Marty left the band 2013 when the ep was released.
In January 2013 Hazim joined as a drum replacement for Marty. The band is basically located in Bremen. The played a few smaller live shows before finding Jay as a bass player. They already played bigger shows and festivals like Arschcholio, Arena Of Pain and Berlin Deathfest.
After finishing playing live this year, they will finish the writing process for the first full length album, which will be recorded in 2014
