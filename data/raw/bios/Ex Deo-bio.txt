Ex Deo is a Canadian metal band formed in 2008 in Montreal, Quebec, a new Roman themed death metal group led by Maurizio Iacono (Kataklysm) released their debut album Romulus to the world on June 19, 2009 (Europe) and June 30, 2009 (North America) via Nuclear Blast Records.

The album was recorded with producer (and Kataklysm guitarist) Jean-Francois Dagenais (Misery Index, Despised Icon, Malevolent Creation).

Ex Deo was formed in 2008 as an artistic project Maurizio Iacono was really interested in and as it caught on, it became more of a band. However, Iacono said in an interview that Ex Deo will not be as active as Kataklysm is.
“ Ex Deo is more of a prestigious type of band. We're not going to tour intensively for it, we're not going do as much as we do for Kataklysm. Kataklysm is a world-warrior band, you know. It's on the road constantly and more in touch with social aspects. This (Ex Deo) is more something artistic, you know. ”
Ex Deo's debut album Romulus was released through Nuclear Blast Records on June 19, 2009 in Europe and was released on June 30, 2009 in North America. The album was recorded with producer and Kataklysm guitarist Jean-Francois Dagenais, featuring guest appearances by Karl Sanders (Nile), Obsidian C. (Keep of Kalessin) and Nergal (Behemoth).
