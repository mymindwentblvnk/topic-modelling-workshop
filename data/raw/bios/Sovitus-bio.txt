Sovitus Sovitus is a pagan/folk metal band from Middelburg, The Netherlands. The members are: Richard Wessels (Vocals), Imre Beije (Drums), Jasper Bruggeman (guitar), Sander Visser (guitar), Johan Goedbloed (bass) and Ruben Willemsen (keys).

Sovitus’ music is best to be described as a mix of metal and pagan/folk music; in which metal is the principle of the music and the mythology serves the content of the songs. A certain amount of folk instruments is added to strengthen the melodic aspect of the metal.

The name Sovitus is derived from the Finnish word, of which one meaning is arrangement. In musical terms this means the placement of melodies in a whole new context to create a new atmosphere and a new entity.

In 2006, the band was formed by Richard Wessels, Imre Beije, Jasper Bruggeman and Bo Beckers. Camillo Klingen was asked to join the band and add a second guitar to the music. After recording the first demo-album, Winter Battle, in spring 2009, Bo and Camillo didn’t see themselves in a future with Sovitus and the left. Half a year later the band was made complete by Johan Goedbloed and Sander Visser. With this addition the band became public’s favorite in the band tournament HooiKoorts 2010. Later that year, Ruben Willemsen joined the band to add a keys-section.
