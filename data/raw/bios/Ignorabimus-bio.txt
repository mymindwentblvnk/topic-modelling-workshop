Ignorabimus is a metal band formed in Tallinn, Estonia in 1994 and disbanded in 2004. They drew influences from doom metal, heavy metal and death metal.

Originally, the band consisted of guitarists Kaarel and Sorts with Uziel handling both harsh vocals and bass guitar. Tarmo (drums) completed the lineup. In 1999 Kaarel was replaced by Sven Varkel alias Aksel who also sang clean vocals. In 2004, just before disbanding, Pille joined the band to handle harsh lead vocals.

They released their first demo in 1996 which was followed bv 3 LPs: "Hinc Illae Lacrimae (1998)", "Dab Da Zorp (2000)" and "Teath Datas (2004)". In 2000 they were the warm-up act for Iron Maiden in Tallinn. In 2001 they released a single "HÃ¼podermic Pleasure".

Ignorabimus decided to call it quits in 2004, with Aksel and Pille joining Human Ground and Tarmo, Uziel and Sorts forming Nihilistikrypt. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ignorabimus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
