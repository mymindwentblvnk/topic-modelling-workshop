(1) Walpurgis was founded in the beginning of the 70's by the Polish and German musicians Ryszard Kalemba (guitar), Jerszy Sokolownski (guitar, vocals), George Fruchtenicht (bass), Jan Sundermeyer (percussion, flute), and Manfred Stadelmann (drums, vocals). During May and June 1972 WALPURGIS recorded their first and only record "Queen of Saba" for the famous German OHR label, in the Dierks Studio in Stommeln, with Dieter Dierks engineering and Frank Ã–ser producing. Jurgen Dollase from the band WALLENSTEIN played keyboards. The band plays a Westcoast and Psychedelic influenced Krautrock. Their music is based on long improvisations mainly on guitar with organ and piano work by Dollase. WALPURGIS didn't break through and never gained a second opportunity, due to the demise of OHR reords in 1973.

(2) Walpurig hails from Belgium playing Melodic Dark/Death Metal from 1998 until 2003.  They released a demo tape "The Darkest Dream" and a demo CDR "And Then There Shall be None".  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Walpurgis">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
