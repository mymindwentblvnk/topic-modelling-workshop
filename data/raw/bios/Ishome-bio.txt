Ishome is the pseudonym of female electronic recording artist Mirabella Karyanova (born December 12, 1990) from Krasnodar, Russian Federation. The word "Ishome" itself is a meaningless made-up word, pronounced as "is-home." Her music has been variously described as a blend of ambient techno, idm, and future garage.

Karyanova started out in 2005 by practicing on various sequencers and teaching herself how to use them. Her first official release was the Al Capone EP issued in 2010 via the Ukrainian record label Indeks Music. Several other EPs followed, and her first full-length debut album Confession was out in 2013 through Fuselab. The LP was a major success in the world of underground electronic music within and outside Russia.

Since Confession, Ishome has not released any studio material and prefers to remain more of a live act, doing occasional live shows and DJ sets. She has also produced a few tracks and a music video under a different moniker of Shadowax.
