Joseph of Mercury is a singer, songwriter, and producer from Toronto who has done some impressive work behind the scenes,  including co-writing on Majid Jordan's "Something About You" and vocal production on Blood Orange and Nelly Furtado's beautiful "Hadron Collider."

Now, we get to hear his own voice and his own vision on his self-titled debut EP, which is out September 1. New song "Angel" is his best work yet, a track isn't chasing current trends or styles, instead being rooted in classic pop and rock. "Angel" is a love song, but Joseph understands that falling in love is by no means easy or simple.

"'Angel' is about finding someone that suddenly means more to you than anything else," he explains. "A choice then arises. Do you pull away and protect yourself or do you surrender and risk the possible lows and unimaginable highs."
