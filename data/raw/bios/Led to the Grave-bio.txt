Led To The Grave - Unholy Thrash Metal from the damned shores of Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Formed in late 2006. S/T Full Length CD released October 2008. Followed up with two Eastern U.S. Tours in 2009/2010. September 2010 saw the release of the band’s second self-released CD, “Sent to Burn”. This EP comes as a 4 panel Digipack limited to 1000 copies. Shortly thereafter, the band embarked on another Eastern U.S. Tour in support of the new disc. This band is a classic example of what happens when you mix the ferocity of punk with the technically sound riffs of metal. They recently recorded a song for a 4-way split 7” to be released by Obscenity Cult Productions. There are also plans for more touring in 2011.
