Peter and Kerry is British duo Peter Lyons and Kerry Leatham. 

The duo began as an impulsive side-project. The two solo artists, who had become close friends following a years' worth of label-related activities, decided to make use of some spare time one weekend. Having never fully-collaborated, the duo bravely embarked upon an uninterrupted writing and recording session which took place over several days at Lyons' family home in Southampton.

They returned to London with a finished record. Their first release is entitled 'Clothes, Friends, Photos EP'. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Peter+and+Kerry">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
