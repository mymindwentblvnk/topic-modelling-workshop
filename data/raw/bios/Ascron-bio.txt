Established in beginning of 2007, the two band members (Skorn, Graneth) have released three songs so far, three more to come in the near future.
Their project's genre is Black Metal, influenced by Death Metal. One striking feature in their songs is an epic passage in order to address metalheads who like classical as well, so Dimmu Borgir fans should give it a try. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ascron">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
