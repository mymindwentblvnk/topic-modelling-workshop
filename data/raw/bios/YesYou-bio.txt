YesYou is production duo Jono Kirkham and Gav Parry. You’ve probably heard their gorgeously buoyant debut track 'Half Of It' which made some ripples on the internet throughout 2011. Recently they've been holed up in the studio writing and producing tracks with and for acts such as Jinja Safari and DZ Deathrays that are notable for their classy production and classic indie pop sensibility.  Performing live as a four-piece, the band have supported the likes of Oscar & Martin, Electric Guest, Neon Indian and Ball Park Music. ‘Frivolous Life (ft. Marcus Azon)’ is the first single off YesYou’s debut EP, due out in November. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/YesYou">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
