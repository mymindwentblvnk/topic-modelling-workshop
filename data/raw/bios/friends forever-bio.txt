Friends Forever is a Denver, Colorado noise-rock trio.  Playing out of a traveling venue (a VW Van), they performed 'Stadium-Inspired' live sets on street corners throughout the United States.  

Originally a two-piece, bass and drums, their exploits were catalogued in the documentary film Friend Forever directed by Ben Wolfinsohn.  The film shows them, with a sad, grim determination, playing for pathetically small crowds in parking lots and street corners out of a VW Van.   In the film their performances went something like this:  
Show up to the venue/parking lot in the afternoon to get a parking space in front.  Set up the drum set in the back, an amplifier with bass in the front.  Hook up all the lighting, smoke machine, lasers, etc.  Play 15 minutes of noisy rock music.  

In 2003 they added a third member on keyboards and released an album on Load Records entitled KillBall.  Dedicated to John Elway, the album was a noise rock tribute to sports detailing a fictional game played in the future that is somewhat like American football but taken to the extremes of violence.     

In 2005 the band called it quits.  They were soon replaced by the short lived Josh Taylor's Friends Forever which had none of the prior members.  Josh Taylor is now playing in Foot Village and lives in Los Angeles California. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Friends+Forever">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
