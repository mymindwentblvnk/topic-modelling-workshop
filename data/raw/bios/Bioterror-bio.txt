In the middle of May of 2002, Alain Casta..o (ex AMNESIA),Gorka Otero (ex AMNESIA) and Juan ..Frute.. Herrera decided to form BIOTERROR, a Death Metal band with trash and black metal influences. After months of hard work, the band and their music starts to get form. A year and a half later, Juan, by personal reasons, leaves the band and Javier Olaso ( ex AMNESIA ) replaces him on the drums. The band continues working and receives two new members, Alain "Dalai" Gutierrez (ZULDAR) and Ugaitz Aguilar (ZULDAR), with which the band and the compositions consolidate definitively, having a more melodic sound that in the beginnings but with the same intensity. BIOTERROR has published their first studio album ( DROWNED IN SURFACE - December 2005) recorded at the 666 studios with Egoitz..Txibu..Gorbea and Angel..capitan Harlock..Rodriguez. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bioterror">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
