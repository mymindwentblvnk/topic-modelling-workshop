Cosmic Vortex is a Grindcore band from Jakarta that has been initiated by Dipa (Bass-Noxa) and Arly (Guitar-Disagree). On November 8, 2011 the plan was finally realized by recruiting Didik (Vocal-ex-Genderuwo/Northside/Peligro) and Komanx (Drumâ€“Hard To Kill/Disagree).

Cosmic Vortex plays a British/American grindcore with influence from Lock Up, Napalm Death, Terrorizer and European Hardcore bands such as Ryker's and Brightside.

Like other grindcore bands, its lyric also tells about the protest in social/political, environmental and personal issues. But Cosmic Vortex's lyric also tells about the philosophy from Game or movie according to the perspective of Cosmic Vortex itself. Just like one of our song called Face Him, Face The Demon, which is inspired by Street Fighter Game.

The meaning behind the name of Cosmic Vortex is:
Cosmic = Solar System/Space
Vortex = Whirpool/Circle/Boundaries

The ideology of Cosmic Vortex is as human being, we should think that the greatness or our ability means nothing compared to what that exist in the universe or what that has been created for us to be enjoyed.
Human pride is a zero point of the destruction of human being itself. Every human being has its own limit and its own capabilities.

In April, 10 2012 Cosmic Vortex released 10 songs CD titled Konspirasi Busuk through Aunorysm Rec. This is the record that have released Looserz, Revitol / For My Blood (Split), Suja, Misery Index, etc. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cosmic+Vortex">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
