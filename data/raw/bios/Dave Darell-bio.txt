Dave Darell = Rob Mayth.

Dave Darell is born in a nice small City in Germany into an extremely musical and crazy family - 1996 he makes his first „attempts of walking“ in his own home-recording studio. By the time, he succeeds more and more and between the years of 2001-2007 he places several dance projects on the market. During this period his own unique electro-style becomes bit by bit apparent. With his single „Children“ he calls the attention of the German dance label „Zooland Records“ in 2008. Together they manage to receive world-wide attention and this simultanously becomes Dave..s international breakthrough. Thereafter he puts out remixes for Scotty „The Black Pearl“, Manian „Turn the Tide“ as well as his second single „Freeloader“. And his 3rd strike together with "Hardy Hard (Berlin)" - "Silver Surfer" - Almost at the same time, these productions lead the dance charts in countless territories.
Dave spends most of his time in his studio developing new ideas and creating thrilling beats, all dedicated to the dancefloor. The rest of his time he spends „on tour“, since, for quite some time, he has made a name for himself as a well booked international Top DJ. For 2009, he already has a lot of plans and ideas and, no doubt, all aficionados of cultivated dance music are wishfully watching out for his upcoming releases. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dave+Darell">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
