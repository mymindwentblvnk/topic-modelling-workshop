Without a vocalist of their own, Shadow hired a session singer to record their first demos. After distributing the demos worldwide, Shadow released their first album Shadow, under Spikefarm Records. At that point, female vocalist Tokiko Shimamoto (who is known as one of the hardest female singers) joined Shadow.

Bailey was born in Belmont, a suburb of Port of Spain in Trinidad, but grew up in Les Coteaux, Tobago, with his grandparents. He began to sing at a very early age and he wanted to be a singer.
