Stone Monolith was founded in the beginning of 2013.
The trio took a moment to find themselves and ended up playing some form of stoner rock.

In a storm of inspiration the guys came up with three songs which found their way to a demo
they recorded themselves in hopes of getting some gigs. 2013 passed as the band wrote more songs and played a few shows at Humppila and Jokioinen.

In the beginning of 2014 Stone Monolith decided to take part in a competition for bands called
Turku Bandstand. At the end of March the trio found themselves in the finals and
somehow came out of it as winners. Winning the competition granted Stone Monolith a single-deal and some gigs. 

Stone Monolith's first single (and music video) titled Bahamut saw the light of day in November 2014

2015 had a solid start as the band was warming-up for swedish Freak Kitchen at Klubi, Turku.

Stone Monolith released their second single in November 2015 called "Through the Noose" and began preparing for their first EP.

On May 14th Stone Monolith released their debut EP Starborn, which was recorded and mixed at Xtudio, Helsinki by Kai Markus Railanmaa and co-produced by Railanmaa and guitarist Peltom√§ki. Jussi Kraft mastered the album. 

In September 2016 Sauli left the band. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Stone+Monolith">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
