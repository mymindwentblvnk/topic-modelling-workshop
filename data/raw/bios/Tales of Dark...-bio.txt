Tales of Dark... (previously named Tales of Dark) is a doom/death metal band from Novi Sad (Serbia) which has been active for eight years already.
The demo CD bears the title "U Kori Tame" and was recorded in early 2003 in Novi Sad and it is the first studio recording of the band. It was well received by the audience and the webzines and fanzines, as well as some radio stations which have been promoting it. The CD contains 4 songs (3 in English and 1 in Serbian) and it represents the first period of the band’s creative efforts. This material was done when the lineup was somewhat different than it is now; consequently, the genre of music was somewhat different – namely, the demo contains quite a bit of gothic influences alongside doom and death metal riffs.
In 2005, the band performed at the Exit Festival and prepared their debut album which featured six tracks. "Fragile Monuments" was released by the Russian label Solitude Productions in August 2006. None of the tracks from the first demo were included on the album.
In 2008 the band has recorded their second full length album titled "Perdition Calls", which was released through Solitude Productions in 2009.
