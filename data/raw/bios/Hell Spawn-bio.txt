There are two artists with the name Hell Spawn:

Hell Spawn is an alternative/experimental metal band from Třinec, Czech Republic. Formed as a school band in 2004 by Koki (vocals, guitar), Toro (drums), Špačo (vocals, guitar) and Kaneček (bass). In their bigginings they tried to play Metallica and Nirvana songs and performed them at the high school in music competitions and live public performance. Later Hell Spawn moved to the garage in Třinec and started to write their own songs. Špačo and Kaneček left the band and Honza came as a bass player. Now there are only 3 members of Hell Spawn. In 2006 the first Hell Spawn demo called "Funeral Worms" was recorded in GM Studio, Jablunkov. There are 4 songs on this album: Two Myselves, Veil Of Snow, Death and Funeral Worms. Their music is very hard to describe, they change distorted and clean guitar parts and death/black metal and clean vocal, often in one track. The main songwriter is Koki, who wrote the most of songs and all the lyrics. 

The other band named Hell Spawn was founded in the autumn of 2009 in Germany (Rheine in N.R.W.). Their style is still developing but can be described as old school death metal with thrash influence.
