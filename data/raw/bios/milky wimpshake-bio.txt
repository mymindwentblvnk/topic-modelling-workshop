Referred to by some as Punk Folk and Twee Skiffle, they're considered witty, satirical, and both irritating and utterly enjoyable,  Newcastle Upon Tyne based Milky Wimpshake have released numerous singles and compilation tracks on assorted indie labels since forming in 1993. The indefatigable and slowly ascending UK based act have sporadically put out three full albums, beginning with 1998’s “Bus Route To Your Heart” released on singer Pete Dale’s own legendary Slampt label, 2001’s “Lovers, Not Fighters”, was recorded at First Avenue studio, in Heaton and issued in 2002 on the ultra-hip Troubleman Unlimited label (also home of Erase Erata, Rogers Sisters) in the States. 2005’s “Popshaped”, was released on Fortuna POP! in the UK and Europe. 

For many Milky Wimpshake are the spiritual godfathers of the now-thriving North-East music scene, and as überlord of the Slampt organisation Pete was responsible for launching a hundred fanzines and as many bands, Kenickie included. Pete sings and strums the guitar and was formerly in Razorblade Smile and Red Monkey and also rocks it in Chronicity and folks it in Pete Dale and The Beta Males; Christine plays bass and sings in the background sometimes; while current stick-wielder is Ricky, who succeeds Ms. Joey Ramone, Mr. Grant Jones and Chris Lanigan (also of Spraydog) on drums.
