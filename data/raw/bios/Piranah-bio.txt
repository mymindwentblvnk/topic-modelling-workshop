Piranah hails from Nashville, TN. Thinking country? Not with these guys. Piranah is a "blue collar", no frills, in your face metal band. The band consists of: Guitarist Matt Seckinger, vocalist Darren Andrews, Thorin Milliken on bass & vocals, and Chris Higgins on drums & percussion. Make no mistake; Piranah is a force to be reckoned with.

Piranah was nominated for best metal band & best percussion in 2007, 2008 (won for best percussion) and 2010 at Nashville’s FM rock station 102.9 The Buzz (WBUZ). The band was also nominated in 2010 & recently in 2011 (winner) for best hard rock/metal band at the N.I.M.A. (Nashville Independent Music Awards). Piranah were the 12th most requested band in 2008 and 10th in 2010 out of over 400+ bands in the Middle Tennessee area. In July of 2009 Piranah were crowned 102.9 Buzz Battle Champs for three months in a row and gaining entry into the Local Buzz Hall of Fame. In 2011 the guys were able to win round 2 (most current round) on Metalsanaz.com featuring bands from around the world. Another big win for the guys was placing an impressive 17th out of 13,179 artists in the Toyota Music Rock This Space competition on Myspace and being voted as the featured artist off the month on the 102.9 Local Buzz website in 2010 & 2012 proves that Piranah continues to gain recognition as well as dedicated fans with every show and each spin their music receives. Most recently, Piranah began to receive airplay for their single "I Am" as well as other songs from their latest release on the “Tiffany Granath Show” and “Night Calls” at Playboy Radio on Sirius/XM Radio Channel 102 as well as reaching fans nationally & internationally through the syndicated rock radio program Hard Rock Nights. Piranah finished 2011 by placing 15th out of hundreds of bands from across the country in the finals of the Project Independent Contest.

With their third release, self-titled (produced by Grammy winner Voytek Kochanek) available now, a 2012 release on the way and 2 albums already to their credit plus an increasing concert schedule covering the Southeast/Midwest along with rave reviews from heavy hitters like David Ellefson (Megadeth/F5) and hard rock/metal personality Metal Sanaz, get ready for this band to break wide open in 2012!
