Puissance is a martial neoclassical act, formed in Linköping, Sweden in 1993 and consisting of members Henry Möller (also in Arditi) and Fredrik Söderlund (also in Parnassus).

Due to their aesthetic approach and member associations, Puissance are often associated with black metal. However, they do not make any use of guitars and rely on electronic instrumentation such as synthesizers and samplers, resulting in an approach heavily influenced by industrial music, but the music is described as heavy neoclassical ambient marches.
The recurring theme among most of the song lyrics is extreme misanthropy and nihilism. Nuclear holocaust is also a commonly explored theme. While influenced by fascism and totalitarian dictatorship, they are not fascists themselves; they merely employ these themes as a way to oppress their listeners. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Puissance">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
