"Everything starts off with an hourlong voicenote. I'll record millions of melodies or thoughts turn into a hook or a topic of inspiration. AA1 are some of the first ones I worked on, they're definitely much stronger now but I didn't wanna lose the thoutghts I once had. If it were up to me, I'd start from scratch every day. My opinions change but also I'll grow and improve musically. You hotta let go at some point thoufh and let people grow with you, right?" 

This is the description Jackie herself gives about AA1. Born in Brazil to a German father and Carioca Mother, she oftentimes talks contrasts and extremes in regards to beliefs, upbringing, culture etc, which opened her mind to wanting to understand human nature; why we do what we do, feel what we feel, when we do it, and how. A lot of times one has the feeling she writes songs simply to process her findings for the equal minded or opposed. 
While Act 1 focuses more on love, loneliness, character building and self-healing, everything has a big hint of inner growth & questioning oneself and others, which lead to the less publicly spoken about topics of her mind to be touched upon in Act 2, rumored to be more hip hop, less pop. The topics of her tunes in no way describe the genre or intensity of the songs. You will find yourself istening to a rumba about unrequited love, a hip hop track about inner growth or a more confortale pop ballad about the lust for attention. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jackie+Apostel">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
