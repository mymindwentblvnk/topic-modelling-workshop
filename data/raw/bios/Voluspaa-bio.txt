Voluspaa is a one-man-band born and raised in Hønefoss (Same city as other cool bands: Beastcraft, Endezzma, Kvist, Myrkgrav, Urgehal, Vulture lord, Ásmegin)

Voluspaa got started by Freddy Skogstad, back in 1994. So their first years was old school black metal with Viking influence. Over the years Voluspaa has turned more and more into National romantic / viking / folk but still the extreme side to it.
