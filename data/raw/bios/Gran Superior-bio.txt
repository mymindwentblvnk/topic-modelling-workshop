gran SUPERIOR from Hamburg have obviously done their homework. You’ve got to witness this band performing live and you will know what a musical explosion feels like. Pushing riffs, gripping guitar solos, aggressive shouting and an extremely melodic voice characterize this band. They successfully combine Old-School with modern Heavy Metal and add some dirty rock to create a unique sound. Founded in the summer of 2004, the band has already given proof of their skills at numerous gigs across the north of Germany as well as on their 4-Track EP, which was recorded in the 02-Studios in Hamburg. All in all a band you definitely don’t want to miss!

In September 2006 Robin, the singer, leaved the band.
