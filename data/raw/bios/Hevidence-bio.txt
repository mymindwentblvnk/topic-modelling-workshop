Hevidence is a project-like "just-for-fun" band from North Karelia, Finland. Hevidence manages to combine heavy elements such as grunt vocals, rhythmic guitar riffs and extreme drum patterns with well-known children songs. Songs are sung mainly in finnish, but in the track called "Onnenpäivä" german language is also used. The band consists of four members: Mikko (vocals), Jani (bass), Tomi (guitars) and Lassi (some vocals and drum stuff). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hevidence">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
