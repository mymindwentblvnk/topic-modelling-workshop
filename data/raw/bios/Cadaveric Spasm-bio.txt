Cadaveric Spasm was formed in 2009 after the wake of every member's old bands breaking up. What started as a fun local band took off and became a serious, fun local band. Brutal grind/experimental act to some, confusing sonic mess to others, but always a head turner.

No breakdowns. No dancing. No fun. Smoke Dust. Live forever.
