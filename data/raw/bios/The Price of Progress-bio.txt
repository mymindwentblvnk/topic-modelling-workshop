Dave likes to play music. He likes to write music. This is his music. He writes alot of different styles, mainly influenced by indie rock however. He loves Jesus. He hopes to express that in his music. There's alot to life, and he wants to write lyrics that reflect that. He feels it's important not to be one dimensional or fail to address the full gamut of what we humans face in our lives. He's writing alot of music at the moment. He loves sharing it with you and is looking forward to start playing live shows once more. He's grateful for each friend he has on MySpace and is happy that they enjoy his music. He hopes he can keep bringing song after song to your ears~
