Sympathy churns out its own unique style of  Blackened Death Metal with sickening aggression. Huge walls of thick crunching guitars, coupled with the soaring sounds of synths give Sympathy's music a hauntingly surreal quality that mixes the sinister with the saintly, the malignant with the majestic, and the hellish with the heavenly. Their lyrical themes tend to revolve around subjects such as theology, philosophy, and death. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sympathy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
