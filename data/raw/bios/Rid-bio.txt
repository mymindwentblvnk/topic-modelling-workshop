…Rest In Disgrace is a band formed in the year of 2007. As a musical style, the group presents a Death/Doom metal with some references to both traditional and more modern “melodic” metal (Heavy/Thrash).

The lyrics are mainly focused on Buddhism, Hindu mythology and Philosophy (especially pessimistic), concerning intimate questions and experiences: decaying spirituallity, unreachable freedom, compassion, psychological despair and yet happiness…

The first studio work is an EP entitled “As Beauty Springs From Mud…”, making an allusion to these particular matters and aesthetical fields pointed before.
