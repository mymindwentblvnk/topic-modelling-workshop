Sanctity was a Finnish Heavy/Progressive Metal ban that underwent many name changes. Originally starting out as Disposal, they released a demo and a 7", then changed their name to Sancnity and proceeded to release a 1992 demo, entitled "Portrait", then their famous full-length, "Dew".

After the release of Dew, they changed their name again, this time to Wooden Bone and began to play Progressive Hard Rock.

They have achieved much fame in Finland, finishing third in the "Finnish Rock Championship Contest" and first in an international music video contest in Canada for their song "Some Little Thoughts". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sancnity">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
