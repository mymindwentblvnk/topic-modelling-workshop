Sinoath is an Italian black/death/doom metal band formed in 1990. They released a demo in 1991 titled "Forged in Blood" and a demo in 1993 titled "Still in the Grey Dying". In 1995 they released their first full-length album on Polyphemus Records titled "Research". That year their 1993 demo was reissued on CD by Nosferatu Records. At that point the band became inactive, not releasing another album until 2007's "Under the Ashes" on Elegy Records. They also did a reissue of their 1991 demo with additional live tracks in 2007 on the same label. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sinoath">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
