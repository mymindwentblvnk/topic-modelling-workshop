From youtube:

NEKRODAIMON started at 1998 as a typical Pagan Black Metal one man's band. In 2000 Nekrodaimon released their first "official" self released promo tape with two songs.
After 10 years of abscence Nekrodaimon is back, as one man's band again but with a new style and music, a mix of Hardcore/Punk with raw Black Metal and lyrics spoken in Ancient Greek and Modern Greek about (anti-)religion, Science, Philosophy, Mythology and History.
Nekrodaimon has nothing to do with politics. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nekrodaimon">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
