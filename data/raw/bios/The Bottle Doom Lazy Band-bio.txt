The Bottle Doom Lazy Band was created in November 2005 by BottleBen who wants to play Doom music in tribute of bands as Candlemass, Saint Vitus, Pentagram, Cathedral, Black Sabbath and including psychedelic elements like Ufomammut, Electric Wizard or Paul Chain.

The line-up is completed by Opyat bringing a key more stoner and grungy to the songs, by Guyome also drummer on Pulmonary Fibrosis and Baptized In Vaginal Liquid, by ToS as guitar player, and by BottleDre@m as bass player.

Fog (Angmar and Barfight drummer) is the new TBDLB bass-player since September 2007. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Bottle+Doom+Lazy+Band">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
