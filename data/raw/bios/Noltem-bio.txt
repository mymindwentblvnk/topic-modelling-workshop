Noltem was born in the winter of 2003 when sole member MFJ wrote "Hymn of the Wood". Excited by the results, he threw himself into writing music that represented the atmosphere and feeling of nature, and the overwhelming impact of a cold winter landscape on the senses. At once bleak and lush, the Noltem demo was ready to be recorded by late 2004. MFJ recorded the demo during the winter of 2004-2005, and began distributing it to select musicians and fans nationwide. The demo successfully captured the intent of creating music that melds influences from black metal, pagan metal, folk music, and dark, ambient soundscapes to create a deeply emotional meditation on man's place in nature. After encouraging responses from the select few who heard the demo, MFJ decided to begin the hunt for a label for Noltem. No corpse-paint. No severed cow heads. No unreadable logos. Noltem refuses to be lumped into constraining, easy to categorize genres, instead opting for an approach that demands concentration on what matters most: the music. The future will see much more from Noltem. Expect more material that further embraces multiple genres: from traditional folk influences to dark, bleak, ambient walls of emotion to screaming black metal, be sure that a dark, promising future lies ahead.
