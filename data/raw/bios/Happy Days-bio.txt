Happy Days is a black metal duo that originally began in Sarasota, USA as a solo project consisting of guitarist/bassist/vocalist A. Morbid who started the group by himself at 14 years old in the year 2004. But music wasn't released until he recorded three demos under the Happy Days name in 2007. In 2008, Karmageddon (Managarm, Wedard, Griefthorn) joined the band as the permanent drummer and has contributed to every release since. The only exception is the "Children of Failure" split, where (in fact) a drum machine was used and had its songs written entirely by A. Morbid. 

Happy Days's lyrical themes include suicide, negativity, depression, extreme emotional pain, betrayal, failed relationships and misanthropy. With both members living in separate states, most music is created and recorded separately by each musician then mixed by A. Morbid to get the final outcome. A. Morbid currently resides in San Antonio, Texas and Karmageddon currently resides in Carlsbad, California. Despite them living in different states, they have eventually met each other in person. A. Morbid traveled to California on a few occasions that led to writing and creating music with Karmageddon in the same room. One example of a song the two recorded together is the track "Abigail".

So far, every release by Happy Days has been recorded at either's homes. As of 2014, however, Happy Days announced that their next full-length album will be their first release to be recorded in a real studio.
