Inherited Truth formed in 2007 by the current four members, Kitamura on vocals, Saiki on guitar, Fujioka on bass, and Kanai on drums.
The band has produced original metal music by expressing the dramatic cosmology of heavy metal through the seriousness, speed and agression of thrash metal / death metal.
Since the beginning of the band, Inherited Truth have been managing the live event "METAL RETALIATION", inviting various styles of metal bands that represent Japan, and have held a total of 13 shows in Tokyo and Osaka together.
In 2008, they completed their first studio work consisting of 4 songs, with Pierre Remillard as the producer who has worked with bands like Cryptopsy, Krisiun, and Beneath The Massacre. However, the band announced cancellation of the release, and stopped playing shows.
In 2012, Inherited Truth broke the silence to be active again, and in April, released the new song "WINGS OF SUBLIMATION"
