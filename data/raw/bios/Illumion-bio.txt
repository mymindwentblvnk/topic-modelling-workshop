Illumion plays progressive rock music with a unique sound. They blend influences from old school symphonic rock, gothic metal, classical music and the vocals of the older Kate Bush into their own unique style. Although the guitar of Eveline plays a major part in the music, the second studio album "The Waves" has a balanced sound that will appeal to fans of complex progressive rock music.
