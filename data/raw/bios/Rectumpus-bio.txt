Maarten and John wanted to start a band, but they still needed a drummer and a bass player. 
Birger (singer from Nocturnal Empire)said he knew two metalheads that wanted to join a band. So they met each other, had a good talk and started Rectumpus.

Due to circumstances the drummer couldnâ€™t be at the rehearsals. So the band needed once again a drummer. They were still looking for a bass player too. After awhile they finally found Gaetan and Stephanie, a drummer and a bass player from De Panne. After the first repetition (somewhere in September 2004) John was kicked out from the band, because of the difficulty with two guitar players. Whe did a few gig's with this line-up, but after a year Gaetan & Stephanie where kicked out, because of the lack on intression. 

Davy & Maarten searched agian after a new drummer and bassist. A few months later thy med sid (drums) and Floris (bass). Sid drummed a month or 2, but because of personal problems. he had to stop. Sow Maarten has take over the drums. At Juni 2006 we found a new singer in the person of Dries herreman. Also a member of Peniskaas.

And in 2007 Joeri Herregat joined the band as the new bassplayer. With this line-up they deceided to start all over again, with a whole new sound.

Current line-up: 
Vocals: Dries "Krulle"
Guitar: Davy "Wet Fart"
Bass: Joeri "Board"
Drums: Maarten "Stinky"
