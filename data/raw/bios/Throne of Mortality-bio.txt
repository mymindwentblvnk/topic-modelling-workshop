Throne of Mortality was a black metal band active from 2005 to 2007 in Edison, New Jersey. The band was founded by Alexandre Julien in the summer of 2005, mostly influenced by Swedish death metal. However it quickly grew to be strictly black metal. Howard Change was welcomed on full time vocals and session bass, and Mike Obregon on drums. Mike soon quit for different musical orientation, but the duo kept writing material. In September of 2005 they recorded the first demo "Summer '05 Rehearsal". Sabbat then left for college, and Alexandre Julien took over vocals. He would record two instrumental demos that fall and winter, before setting on a guitar/vocal demo entitled after the name of the upcoming full length "Monumental Dedication".

By the time the Monumental Dedication Demos was done, it was summer and Alexandre Julien had moved to Montreal, Quebec. At this time he was forced to give up vocals due to living arrangements, but he continued to write new material for a second full length due to be entitled "Morbid Depression". Only a few instrumental demos were ever recorded, and by the time he moved back to New Jersey in late 2006, the band had mostly faded away, with concentration being put forth in Vision Lunar and Vision Ã‰ternel. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Throne+Of+Mortality">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
