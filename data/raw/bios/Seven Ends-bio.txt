Seven Ends is a Modern Thrash band from the southern regions of The Netherlands. They've been causing local earthquakes since early 2009 with music you can describe as furious thrash/death metal. Speed and aggressiveness are the main ingredients, all flavored with a hint of melody and a grooving touch to it. Their live performance is always tight and fast, and presents a great atmosphere. 

Seven Ends was formed in the darker months of 2007 by guitarist Ricardo, vocalist Jan and drummer Cor. Not long after, Noud joined bringing thunder with his bass, together with Tim on guitar completing the band. Tim's presence was not very long lived, after about a year he was replaced by Leon, as is the current formation of the band. 

Their first EP was recorded in 2008 and it was time to hit the stage. Reactions to EP and live performance were overwhelming from the start. In the first year Seven Ends was playing live with bands like Legion of the Damned & Torture Squad, and summer 2010 they got their chance at the legendary Wacken open air festival in Germany after winning the Dutch Wacken Metal Battle, among the greatest names around in metal and rock. Again, audience and media reactions were unbelievable. 

In 2011 Seven Ends finished recording their first full length album titled "To the Worms", mixed and mastered by no other than Andy Classen (Legion of the Damned, Belphegor, Tankard). In October of that same year they got signed by legendary German recordlabel Massacre Records who are going to release the album on march the 23rd 2012!
