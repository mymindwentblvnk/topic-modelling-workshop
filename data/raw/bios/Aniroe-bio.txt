ANIROE means "I am the Seer" and through this vision ANIROE wishes to reveal combined power of metal genre sounds and Hebrew magical potential.

Solo project that has evolved throughout many years and finally has found its expression in 2009/5770 in Warsaw, Poland, Europe, Earth, Universe & Multiverse

Founded by NIKA11GNOSIS (co-member of Taarwilknikmarr, Endura (pl), Silva, Echad, Brixen-ku), great enthusiast of Abraham Abulafia's mystical works and kabbalistic techniques.

All lyrics are in Hebrew as this is one of the last ancient magical languages still being used by living ethnic group (Hebrews, Israelis, Jews). However, more important is the fact that it has extreme power and evocative might hidden in itself.

As black/doom genre rather avoids dark and magical elements found in Hebrew ancient texts (maybe due to lack of awareness that texts CLAIMED by christians and judaism believers are NOT OWNED by them?), this area has been uncovered by any artist - until today...
