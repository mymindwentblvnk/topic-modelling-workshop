MAKE GOOD YOUR ESCAPE is Mike Yates, Steve Wattis, Tim Fleet and Tim Foreman.

After years of playing in various bands in their rather uninspiring hometown of Chichester, slowly honing their abilities and developing an intense love for playing live, MGYE was born in the summer of 2004. 

In September 2007, MGYE announced they were to split.
