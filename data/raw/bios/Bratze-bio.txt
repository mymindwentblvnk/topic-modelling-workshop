Bratze is the new fancy electrohouse project of Kevin Hamann (ClickClickDecker, My First Trumpet) and Norman Kolodziej (Der Tante Renate). The two friends and labelmates thought  it would be the time to create something without compromises. Bratze is ambious techno-electro-pop with more than one message.
