Set In Stone was formed in December of 2008 in St. Helens, Oregon. Originally started as a four-piece and adding another guitarist in 2009. In early April of 2009, we performed our first show at a local bar, which brought hundreds of people together. Since then, we have performed at numerous places such as Club Satyricon, Hawthorne Theatre and the Bossonova Ballroom. Not to mention special events and local favorites such as Tekila Willies, Twilight Cafe, Oregon State Fair, Portland Live Loud & Local Music Festival and Battle of the Bands.

In May of 2010, we were selected by KUFO to participate in a live interview for the Viva La Luna show. Over the years, we have performed many benefit shows donating over $2,500 into our local community and Relay for Life.

We are currently releasing our first professional album �Open Doors� on Friday, May 13th, 2011. The album will consist of 11 professionally recorded, mixed and mastered tracks and will be available for purchase on the night of the Album Release Party on May 13th at the Hawthorne Theatre. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Set+in+Stone">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
