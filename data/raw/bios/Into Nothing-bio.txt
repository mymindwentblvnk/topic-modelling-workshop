"Into Nothing" is a small amateur metal project by guitarist Fabian P. from Velbert, Germany. He first began songwriting in January 2006, only 3 months into guitar. Over the years he improved his playing and his songs began to go in a more complex, even more melodic and heavier direction.
The project name describes his ambitions - never knowing the direction where the project will get to and not having any idea about that. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Into+Nothing">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
