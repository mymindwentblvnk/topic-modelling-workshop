Acephale, based on the ideas and motivations of the early 20th century artist, philosopher, esoteric, secret circle and journal of the same name. Most prominent amongst its members, Georges Bataille, whose writings gave life blood to that and this project. Acéphale from the Latin a-cephalus, headless or without a chief; Our monikers: Religion. Sociologie. Philosophie & The Sacred Conjuration. An ensemble fiercely religious in a Nietzschean manner, currently resurrected in this incarnation fusing equal portions Epistemic Terrorism and Literary Atavism basing its transmission in the combination of both Black Metal and Folk elements. Conceived initially by Set Sothis Nox La on a steady diet of Wolfthorn, Les Joyaux De La Princesse, Corrupted, Toroidh, Hate Forest, Drudkh, Krzysztof Penderecki, Veljo Tormis, Henryk Górecki, Huun Huur Tu, A.V.A and various Tibetan and world folk musics in the cauldron of ceremonial birth.
