Paddy and the Rats was formed by the singer-songwriter Paddy, Vince (bass) and Joey (electric guitar) in 2008. Then Seamus (drums) joined them and two authentic musicians, Sonny (accordion) and Sam (fiddle, tin whistle, banjo and bagpipe). As for their becoming rats, the six „Irish” guys say: punk is the same in music as rats among the animals – dirty and malicious, and they exactly play it. The band is combining different nations’ pub music with hot and dirty punk rock. To spice up their own songs they use Irish pub music and Celtic features, but sometimes Russian and gypsy elements and rhythms are also present. The band’s first album – Rats On Board – will be released in march 2010 by Nordic Records and it will be available on Itunes and Amazone. Also, Uncleowen Records is releasing it in Japan. Those listening to their music won’t definitely stay sober, because the rolling jig rhythm makes everybody dance and even jump – and get drunk! Most of the lyrics are about drinking and pub stories (Fuck You I’m Drunk, We will fight, Pub’n roll). Last year they had more than 100 gigs, they took part in festivals in Hungary, Sweden, Denmark, Austria, Slovakia and Serbia. At gigs, besides their own songs they play such Irish songs as Wild Rover or Whiskey In The Jar, sailor songs (Drunken Sailor, Bully In The Alley) and punk anthems (Sex Pistols, Green Day) with fiddle, banjo, accordion, bagpipe, whistle – and of course, a lotta rock’n’roll. Their aim is to introduce the crowd to different kinds of pub music and pub culture…

To be more precise: turn the whole world into a pub!
