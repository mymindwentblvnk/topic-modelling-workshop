Pororoca was found in Czech republic in the beginning of year 2009 by guitarist Patrik Soška. His playmates had become guitarist (but for this band, he is playing bassguitar) Jacob Fritsche and Ondra Kubeš on the drums.
The band couldn't find someone who can do good vocals, so in the end Jacob is "used" for vocals too. (Although I am not a singer :-))
In the moment, band is working on it's first songs and is getting ready for first gig in autumn 2009.

Band line-up:
Jacob - bass, vocals
Patrik - guitars
Ondra - drums <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/POROROCA">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
