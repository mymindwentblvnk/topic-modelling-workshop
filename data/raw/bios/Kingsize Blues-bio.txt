Kingsize Blues were a London 5-piece churning out thrashy death metal of the highest quality. They mixed huge riffs with intense hate-filled vocals, waling solos and melodic breakdowns with connsumate ease. Their 2005 EP Live Fast and Die[/aritst] got them noticed by just about anyone following the UK metal underground.  Sadly they split up May 2008 before completing their debut album.

Tom Hennessy - Vocals
Quinton Lucion - Lead Guitar
Bastad - Lead Guitar 
Matt Caley - Bass 
Tori - Drums <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kingsize+Blues">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
