Germany's Demonic Symphony is quite a unique band. Defying being labeled a particular genre of metal, they manage to incorporate many musical styles in their arsenal of music. With musical styles ranging from power metal, rock and gothic, Demonic Symphony also shows influence from early Dream Theater and Dio. Fans of Power Metal, Progressive Metal, and Metal in general will like this album. The guitars are the strong points here as the riffs are masterful and contagious and the solos could stand with the best of metals great guitarists.
