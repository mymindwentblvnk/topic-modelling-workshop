Hellenic black metal band who released three demos in the mid 90s before dissolving into the ether. An interesting fusion of Norse and Hellenic styles with a focus on a melancholic atmosphere. Occasional acoustic/keyboard interludes bolster the ripping black metal guitar work. Featured a member of The Elysian Fields. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Havorum">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
