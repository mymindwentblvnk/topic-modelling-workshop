Bernd Begemann is a contemporary German alt/pop singer linked to the Hamburger Schule from Hamburg. He is especially known for his extraordinary live performances. With respect to his musical attitude, Begemann said: "I only make music because nobody can speak for me. I'm the only one who can. That's why being punk doesn't just mean drinking cheap beer and puking on the sidewalk." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bernd+Begemann">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
