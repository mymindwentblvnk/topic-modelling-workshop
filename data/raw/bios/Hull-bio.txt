There are two artists with the name Hull:

1) Brooklyn based quintet Hull creates a crushing progressive sludge as if a heavier, more grimy blend of Baroness, Neurosis/Cult of Luna and Mastodon.  They inject a fusion of metal, progressive rock and post metal into the veins of their doom breathing creation in order to amass a mutated beast that is like nothing else out there.

J.Stieber 
C.LaiettaV 
N.Palmirotto
S.B.Dunn 

Hulls first self released EP, Viking Funeral, an epic 16+ minute track  packed with more changes in sound than your average band could muster on an entire album, received positive reviews.  In June 2009 Sole Lord was released, a powerful album containing colossal guitar riffs and crushing drums.

'From the depths of the darkness crawl beasts most foul; yet none can withstand the furious might of the axes of hull.  Many proclaim them  descendents of the Volsung; as Sigurd before them, they shall become that of legend among those of their home port of the place called Brooklyn, and lands afar'
