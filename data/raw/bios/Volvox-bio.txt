There is more than one Volvox on last.fm:

1. Volvox were a Melbourne experimental trio extant from 1991 to 96, comprising Reg Egg (Anthony Riddell aka Lester Vat), Reg Egg (Glenn Norman) & Reg Egg (Dave Taskas, previously in Grong Grong).  Anthony's vocal style was affected by the neurological damage he suffered in the late '80s after falliing through plate glass.

2. Volvox was the inaugural band of The Volvox Collective and ultimately led to the formation of Orchestral Colour Records. It was founded in late 2003 by Scott Meisburger (then of The Storks), Nick Furnal, Brendan Wheatley, and Katie Abel.  They would later be joined by singer Rebekah Sousae.  They performed their last concert together in the spring of 2005.  Scott, Nick, and Rebekah went on to form Fancy, while Brendan founded The Radium Girls with Joe Herzog.

3. Volvox is a hungarian funk rock group (influenced with funky music, acid jazz), formed in the early 90's, released one single (Taps) and one LP (Ragyogj!). They are still active.

4. Volvox was an early 1980s German Minimal Wave / Electronic group from the DÃ¼sseldorf Area.
