8 Weeks Dead is a thrash metal band from Danbury, Connecticut. They formed in 2002 as a 5-piece and played several area shows before dissolving in early 2003. Their second lineup formed in May of 2004, and they went on to play many area shows, garnering a small but dedicated fan base. In the spring of 2006 they signed on with Seventh Level Records, a band collective based in Westchester County NY. Around the same time they began playing regularly at Webster Theater in Hartford CT, opening for national touring acts like In Flames, God Forbid, Artimus Pyledriver, Jucifer, Seemless, Lacuna Coil, The Sword, and many others. In May of 2007 they released their first record, a 6-song EP entitled "Projects From the Junkyard". They are currently working with some new band members on new material. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/8+Weeks+Dead">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
