Fans of West Coast underground hip-hop know Roc C for his debut mic appearance on the 2004 Oh No single “Move Pt. 2,” produced by J Dilla. Roc’s stand-out verse and cameo in the song’s video lead to his own deal with Stones Throw Records. As the latest MC from the prolific Oxnard, CA crew (Lootpack, Dudley Perkins, Oh No, MED) to join the label’s roster, Roc is making a lot of noise right out the gate. His first single, Don’t Stop – an Oh No-produced slab of infectious trunk funk – was featured on EA Sports’ Fight Night Round 3 video game. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Roc+C">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
