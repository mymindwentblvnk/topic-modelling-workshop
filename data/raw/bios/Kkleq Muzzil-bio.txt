The roots of Kkleq Muzzil started with Civil Defiance, a thrash/ethnic/psychedelic/jazz outfit that cultivated a following in Germany and other European countries during the 1990's and was distributed through Nuclear Blast (Muzzil bassist Perez was also a member).  Nestler and Perez later hooked up with former Slayer drummer Dave Lombardo for an early incarnation of Kkleq Muzzil, a group called Philm

"It was mainly film music," Nestler recalls. "We did some film music for some short movie shorts in Dave's studio (in Victorville)."

Lombardo became involved in a number of musical projects (including Fantomas with Mr. Bungle throat-wrencher Michael Patton). Hernandez ("George is really punk," Nestler says, "a real punk drummer.") later took his place.

With the band's influences ranging from grindcore (Brutal Truth, Carcass, Bolt Thrower) to industrial-metal (Fear Factory) and from contemporary classics (1930s-era Los Angeles composer Arnold Schoenberg) to Afro-Cuban music, Kkleq Muzzil lays waste with a ferocious sonic assault.

"A lot of people say that the album is not nearly equivalent to the live performance," Nestler says. "And that's just us. I don't know if there's this pent-up anger inside or what, but I guess we're just lucky enough to release." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kkleq+Muzzil">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
