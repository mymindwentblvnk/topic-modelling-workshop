Combining elements of mid-nineties post thrash, hardcore grooves and general metal brutality, Machine Insufficiency slowly forged itself into what it is today – a menacing metalcore machine.
After two locally highly appreciated demo recordings („Conceptional Immortality“ 2004 and „MA_IN 05“), ma_in had already grown into a well-oiled machine, known for merciless live performances and razor - sharp musicianship, further distancing themselves from mainstream's misinterpreted definition of real metalcore. Throughout personal and musical differences, the band was forced to replace their frontman and start writing songs for 2006's self-released „Last Bridge Burning“EP.
With this crushing five- song promo, people were given a chance to witness a new perspective of mixing groovy and abrasive thrash metal with the finest blend of modern face–peeling hardcore.
While being distributed through Oluja distribution, "LBB"'s impact secured them shows on some of Croatias biggest metal festivals and shows with some well known metal acts like Behemoth and Dying Fetus. After a ton of overwhelming album and concert reviews, huge local and growing foreign fanbase, time has finally come to reclaim their status and hardworking ethic.
At the moment, the band is fully concentrated on arranging songs for their new full lenght recording "The Power of Denial", their darkest and heaviest, yet most mature and solid musical escape into social criticism and personal turmoil.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Machine+Insufficiency">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
