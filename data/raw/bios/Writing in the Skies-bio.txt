Writing in the Skies of Holyoke, Massachusetts was formed in December of 2011 by drummer Joel Turcotte, bassist Zach Longhi, and guitarists Wes Parker and Chris Eriquezzo. Since its inception, the band has been expanding and experimenting on the sounds pioneered by Progressive rock/metal bands such as Scale the Summit, Plini, Haken, and Porcupine Tree. The band seeks to challenge themselves and their listeners with complex material while still remaining accessible to non-musician audiences. Since 2011, the band has written over an hour's worth of material and recorded their debut EP Aphasia, which contains five of their songs written and recorded between 2012 and 2013 and has performed throughout Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Hampshire, and Vermont. The band is currently looking to play as many shows as possible in order to expand their audience and bring their music to as many people as possible.
