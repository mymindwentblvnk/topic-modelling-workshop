1. ZONE from Japan was a J-pop band started in Sapporo, Japan in 1999, who went on to become a hit in 2000 with their single Good Days. Their most famous song is Secret Base ~Kimi ga kureta mono~. ZONE is categorized in a new genre called the "bandol" (band + idol) and was started by Studio Runtime. ZONE started off as Takayo plus seven other dancers, then was eventually reduced to four members. After becoming popular, the four girls learned to play their own instruments to complement their singing and dancing. In late 2003, Takayo announced her departure from ZONE. She was replaced by Tomoka, the last member cut from the band before they made up the "original" four.

However, the band has disbanded since March 31, 2005. As 3 of the members would be graduating from high school, they made their decision on a positive disbanding rather than an upsetting disbanding. The reason for disbanding is so that the members can choose their own path in life. The Spring Tour in 2005 was their last performance together as a band, the final song being Secret Base ~Kimi ga Kureta Mono~.
