Powerhill is the union of a Swiss musician (Cep) with two great passions: Cows and Heavy Metal!
The Powerhill saga begins in the year 2000 in a small dark and dirty corner of a cold stable located in a small Swiss town called Taverne from an idea by guitar player Cep .
From there comes the real "Farm Metal", that is a classic Hard Rock / Hair Metal style but completely to the peasant style. In May 2004 the band recorded a 5-track CD Demo. Later, after some changes in the line-up,
the band started proposing live the Metal-Cow motto.
In June 2006 the single "New Dimension" was included in the English "Heavy Metal Nation III" compilation.
From 2007 to 2017 a forced Stop period follows. In 2018, with new members the Band offers some hilarious
live performances. Year 2019 follows the publication of 2 new singles (Mad Cow City & Powerhill).
The Guys emanate from the stage a special verve characterized by a show to peasants oriented.
Their Mascot, the "Clotilde" Cow always follows with its eye-catching look all Live performances.
