In 2003 on remnants of death metal band Corpse Grinder a new group PUS LACTATION was formed by guitarist Grinder. Keeping faith of death metal and undertaking interested people who wished to take part in butchery, which is very hard in a small town. So the line-up was: Max – vocals, Grinder – guitarist, Lysiy – guitar, Dodik – bass, Chi – drums. But soon bassist was fired coz of assholism and profanity. Lysiy took his place instead of guitar.
