SONS OF FAMINE emerged from the razor-winds and salty streets of Chicago, during the season of frost in 2012. Embracing the path of lawlessness, they secrete the sounds of chaos, blackness, and death, without bowing to rules of genre or typical structure. 

Although conception is fairly recent, it's founders have kept the fires of extreme music burning for years as current/ex/session members of CorpseVomit, Yakuza, Kommandant, Nachtmystium, Lividity, 
Gigan, and Cum Christ. 

The band is:
Patrick Clancy - Guitar
Garrett Scanlan - Drums
Matt McClelland - Guitar/Vocals
Mike Dooley - Bass <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sons+Of+Famine">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
