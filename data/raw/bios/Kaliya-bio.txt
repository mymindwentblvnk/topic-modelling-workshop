A multi influenced mix of grindcore, hardcore, and melodic metal.  Thought out song structure and hooks that should appeal to fans of aggressive metal like Slayer, Hatebreed, Carcass, Napalm Death, The Red Chord, At The Gates, and The Black Dahlia Murder

from www.sheepterror.blogspot.com :

There are dynamics and melodies that recall musical peers like Gaza and Blacklisted; instead of just barked vocals and blast beats, there are actual hooks that make each song memorable. "Choke" and "The Reason", specifically, have well thought out song structures and riffs that other bands calling themselves "hardcore" should check out. "Brotherhood" sounds like a tractor trailer pile-up, speeding along with Slayer-like ferociousness until it crashes into a sludgy breakdown sing-along refrain at the end.

These demo recordings have expectations set to HIGH for the future. Here's to hoping we'll be hearing more from Kaliya in the very near future. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kaliya">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
