"No Room For The Living" conceived it's status amongst the American extreme metal scene in 2005.
Intent to do something different musically, in the Maine metal scene posed as an essential task along with performing soulfull extreme metal with influence from the thrash, death, grind, black, rock and crust/punk genres. As practicing and ideas ensued at a steady pace, debut cd "Only The Dead Will Survive" is currently available to the public and thus far, being accepted very well. Efforts to self promote the cd are currently underway with intentions of thorough public exposure. The band started as a 2 piece unit including guitar and drums. Ryan (aka Smegma C.- guitars,bass) started the formation process after the breakup of Maine black metal act "Anno Daemonicus" months before. After receiving a phone call from former "Amaranthus" drummer, Ben (aka Officer Cockshuffle-drums) musical tastes seemed comparable and the creation of unrestricted extreme metal art unraveled. Vocals were at a standstill while songs were being written but soon proved to be an essential part of the future of the band. Scott(aka Captain Funeral-vocals)was retiring his vocal duties in the local act "View From The Noose" due to various differences and ultimately added to the final outcome of what "No Room For The Living" is today... violent, yet humorous metal to obliterate and murder by!!! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/No+Room+For+The+Living">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
