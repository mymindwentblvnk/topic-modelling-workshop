Lordian Guard is the band formed by Warlord guitarist William Tsamis after the breakup of Warlord.  

Composed of William Tsamis on all guitars and keyboard arrangements, his wife Vidonne Sayre-Riemenschneider on vocal duties, and Michael Cerularius on drums, Lordian Guard sounds like a less metallic Warlord with Christian lyrical content.

Albums released by Lordian Guard on Hellion Records (Germany) are:
