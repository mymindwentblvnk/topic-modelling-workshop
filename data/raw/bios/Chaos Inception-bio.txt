"Chaos Inception is dedicated to the destruction and recreation of the current death metal paradigm, and a return the true spirit of the Ancient Gods brought to light by the vision quests of its progenitors."

Chaos Inception is a death metal band from Huntsville, Alabama. The band was formed in early 2008 by surviving Fleshtized members Gary White and Matt Barnes. Cam Pinkerton (formerly Spinecast) was soon added on bass. Chris White (Blood Stained Dusk)  joined the band on vocals in March. 

The debut album "Collision with Oblivion" was released through Brutalized Records (Colombia) in September, 2009. In November, 2010, Chaos Inception decided to part ways with Cam, who later rejoined to record the bass on the upcoming second album. Former Convergence From Within Guitarist Matt Odom assisted the band in a prior show commitment on December 10, 2010.

The new album "The Abrogation" is set to be released via Lavadome productions in spring 2012. The exact release date is yet to be announced. New track "Phalanx (Tip Of The Spear)" is streaming from all band's sites.
