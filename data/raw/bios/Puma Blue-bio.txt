Puma Blue is the alias of singer/songwriter, producer and multi-instrumentalist Jacob Allen, based in London, UK, whose music has been described as 'voicemail-ballads'.
Producing the music himself in his bedroom, Jacob has been recognised for his dynamic, emotive voice, gritty lo-fi sound, particular visual aesthetic, as well as R&B, jazz and hip hop influences.
He first gained a following from his 2014 SoundCloud bedroom demo 'Only Trying 2 Tell U' and slowly cultivated a cult following from live shows around London & on the internet. His debut EP ‘Swum Baby’ was independently released in June 2017, followed by two stand-alone singles on the Blue Flowers label. His second EP ‘Blood Loss’ was released in November 2018, a more ambitious, circular body of work consisting of 8 tracks that blend into eachother.
Live he most often performs with his band, blending watery textures with soulful J Dilla influenced grooves and a vocal likened to Jeff Buckley and Chet Baker.
Originally growing from the south-east London music scene, Jacob has frequently collaborated with friends and peers, including Lucy Lu, Biig Piig & Lava La Rue and honed his sound between intimate live shows and late-night producing sessions at home.
He has cited D'Angelo, Radiohead & John Frusciante among his biggest influences.
Jacob also sometimes makes music under the monikers Ruby Bliels and Boss Nass, though there have been no official releases under these names as of yet… <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Puma+Blue">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
