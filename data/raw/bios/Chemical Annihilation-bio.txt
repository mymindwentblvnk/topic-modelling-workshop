Thrash metal band from Portland, Oregon. They only released two demos in 1989 before calling it quits. These demos were later re-released on one album together with a DVD of a live show under the title "Why Die?" in 2009.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Chemical+Annihilation">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
