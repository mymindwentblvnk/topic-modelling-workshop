Risen from the ashes of Fall of The Bastards and featuring players from Ass√ºck, Wormwood and L'Acephale, Oakhelm is a  folk/black metal band from Portland, Oregon. The band's lyrics are deeply influenced by the "Celtic Book of the Dead," word-of-mouth 'texts' that deal with shamanic journeys one can take to cleanse themselves of their inner turmoils.

The band's debut full-length, "Betwixt and Between," was released in digipack form in 2007 through Forest Moon Special Productions, and later on vinyl through Kreation Records. The band's newest effort is entitled "Echtra," a five-track album spanning 38 minutes and will be released on both vinyl and CD formats through Forest Moon late summer of 2011. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Oakhelm">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
