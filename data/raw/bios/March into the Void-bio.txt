March Into The Void is a band formed in Thessaloniki, Central Macedonia in late 2008-2009.  The band released a self-produced and financed demo, which had an original sound that combined the harsher elements of black metal with the pounding violence of crust punk. They followed its release by playing shows in Greece (at squats and social centres) to support the demo and gain attention.  At this moment, the band is working on new songs and will record them for upcoming releases (a split release with Black Trinity and a solo release). The group members are Apostolis (Bass), Mitsos (Drums), Giwrgos (Guitars), Kostis (Guitars) and Vasilis (Vocals).
