Infestdead is a Swedish death metal band formed by Dan Swanö after leaving Edge of Sanity in 1996. While Swanö was the singer for Edge of Sanity, Infestdead enabled him to use his skills on various instruments including the drums, guitar, bass guitar and keyboards. Andreas Axelsson, also known as Dread, was the lead singer.

The band recorded two albums and a mini-album between 1996 and 1999. These records were released by Invasion Records in Germany before its financial problems. Hammerheart Records subsequently re-released its records in 2000. Infestdead broke up in 1999, allowing Swanö to pursue other projects, including releasing a solo album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Infestdead">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
