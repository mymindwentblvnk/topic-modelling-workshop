In the spring of 2006 we realized that most bands fail because they don't get along with the other members. We have all been in numerous hardcore/metal bands for years and wanted a band that would work together. Thats when we made Dog Eats Flesh. A band that we can have a lot of fun with and not worry about the typical band drama. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dog+Eats+Flesh">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
