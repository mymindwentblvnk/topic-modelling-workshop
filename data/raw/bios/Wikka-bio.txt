Wikka is formed in 1984 under the name Darkon by Mike Childs (v, d), Evan Roworth (g) and Zsolt Henczely (b), and a first 4-track demo tape is recorded with this line up. In 1985 Steve Horwood is added as vocalist, seeing Childs concentrating on his drumming. A year later Henczely is replaced by Jason, and in early 1987 the band name is changed to Oracle. The band enters the studio to record a 10 track demo tape, and by finishing the recordings the band name is finally changed to Wikka. Approaching the end of 1987, Jason leaves the band and in lack of finding quickly a suitable substitution, Evan Roworth records all bass and guitar tracks on the up coming 4-track demo tape. In 1988, two weeks prior to record an EP, Roworth and new bass player Ernie G. leave the band. Due to the fact that the studio was already booked, Horwood and Childs hook up with Zak Black (g) and Rikki C. Ricci (b) to record the self titled EP, which was released in the same year. A few months afterwards, Horwood and Childs part ways, meaning the end of Wikka.
