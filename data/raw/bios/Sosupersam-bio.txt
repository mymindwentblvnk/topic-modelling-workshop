Samantha "So Super Sam" Duenas is a DJ from Culver City, California. She has created a number of mixes available to listen to on her Soundcloud page.  Her Cruel Summer Mixtape from July 2010 received great reviews, blending the likes of Breakbot with Aeroplane and Toro y Moi remixes in grand fashion. Speaking of fashion, So Super Sam's blogspot and tumblr pages are teeming with her favorite menswear and women's wear selections direct from runways and premium boutiques, as well as her latest finds in food, travel destinations and her upcoming show details.

So Super Sam recently did an intimate, impromptu concert with Childish Gambino a.k.a. Donald Glover (former SNL writer & star of NBC's Community) at LA's Fat Beats record store before it closed on September 9th, 2010, and continues to spin at LA and SF events.  Sam has also just released an exciting holiday 2010 mixtape--appropriately titled "Happy Funking Holidays"--exclusively curated for Hellz Bellz clothing, available for free download on her blogspot.
