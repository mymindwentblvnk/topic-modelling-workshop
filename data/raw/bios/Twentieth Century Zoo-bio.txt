Mushroom-laden Phoenix-based psychedelic rock from 1966-1970.  They formed after The Bittersweets disbanded.  The last label they were signed to was Vault.  They released numerous singles and one full-length.  They achieved success only in their region.  They experimented with multiple genres in their later works, including early examples of proto-punk.  They were to play with high-profile and successful artists and Twentieth Century Zoo incorporated their influences with their own unique sound. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Twentieth+Century+Zoo">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
