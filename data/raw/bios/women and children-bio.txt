Women & Children are Kevin Lasting (California) June Serwa (Canada) Jamie Moon (California) and Olivier Robert (France) formed in October 2001. This is their debut release, a self titled album written and recorded at their flat in Paris, France. Women & Children like to play with and combine elements of folk, experimentalism, goth-rock, abstraction, acoustic meanderings, and melodic texture. At the core of many of their songs is the enchanting voice of June Serwa. Their influences are wide and varied and the result is a soft sound saturated with haunted acoustics and illuminated melodies. Together, the music they create radiates playful originality in a seamless flow. Their music has already been embraced by the likes of Chan Marshall of Cat Power and Colm O'coisoig former drummer of My Bloody Valentine, who now plays with Hope Sandoval and The Warm Inventions.
