A solo Black Metal project hailing from Santa Rosa in California, U.S.

The band originally consisted of Gothmog (vocals), Ufthak (bass, keyboards), and Flaguz (drums and guitars), and a small amount of live shows were played before creative differences caused Gothmog to become the sole member of the band.

Gothmog also has an ambient side project called Morgulduin

As of now Woldwarden is working on their Tape E.P., which is planned for release sometime in 2009.
