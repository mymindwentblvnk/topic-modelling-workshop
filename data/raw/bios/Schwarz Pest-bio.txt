A Black Metal band from Italy. The band name is a direct translation of Italian "nero peste" into German. According to the band, the (Italian) term can roughly be translated to "the black (colour) of the plague" and "represent a state, some kind of entity, of anguish and terror inherent [to] the [black] plague". The German translation, however, is grammatically incorrect/incomplete. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Schwarz+Pest">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
