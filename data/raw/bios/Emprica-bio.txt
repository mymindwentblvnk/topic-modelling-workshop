"I was asked to write an interesting quote about this band" 
Jason P.C. 2007 (Blood Duster)

Emprica started in 2002 and 5 years on their dedication to delivering fresh slabs of Australian Hard Rockin' Heavy Metal has never stopped.

Unlike most bands in the limelight these days, Emprica put their songs and live performance a long way before their image. Dripping mascara, grossly styled fringes and synchronized head banging have been totally ignored, giving way to a focus entirely on cool sounding metal and a kick ass live show. Emprica's gig list, boasts supports for a host of truly brutal Australian metal bands like Magic Dirt, The Androids, The Dissociatives, Little Birdy, 67 Special, Behind Crimson Eyes, I Killed The Prom Queen, Sunk Loto, 28 Days and the truly ferocious Youth Group.

Items of note:
November 2004: 1st Place Portland Battle of the Bands 
May 2005: song “Can Of Tuna” placed 9th out of over 400 entries in online comp  “Starburst Soundcheck” 
October 2005: Selected from hundreds of other bands to compete in the Hard Rock Café “Future Rock” competitions 
Won heat in Future Rock comp and progressed to the finals
