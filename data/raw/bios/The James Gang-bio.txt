The James Gang started out in Cleveland, Ohio in the late '60s, and came to fame as a three-piece rock/funk band featuring the legendary Joe Walsh. Joe left in the early '70s, and he was replaced by various guitar players for the next decade, including Dominic Troiano (later of The Guess Who) and Tommy Bolin (later of Deep Purple). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/The+James+Gang">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
