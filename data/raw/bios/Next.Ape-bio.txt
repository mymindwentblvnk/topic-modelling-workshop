"Hectic drum grooves + bouncy Moog + distorted guitar + crystal voice  Next.Ape"

Next.Ape (stylized as .▲) is a Belgium-based band featuring two Belgians, one Hungarian and a Luxembourgish. Four musicians enjoying the exploration of a psychedelic blend of rock and trip-hop. At the crossroads of Radiohead, Damon Albarn, Modeselektor and Miles Davis. The lyrics look very much like short stories. They are rooted in a more and more oppressive yet hopeful reality.
