There are three bands with the name Root.

1) Root is a Czech metal legend from city of Brno founded in 1987 by Big Boss and Blackie. Root was one of the original pre-second-wave black metal bands, following in the footsteps of Bathory and Venom, while taking the genre in a more refined, less savage direction. Their style has since progressed towards a more epic, dark heavy metal sound with a clean-sung vocal approach, but their music can still be recognized as black metal at its core due to the unchanged ideology of the band. After the album Madness of the Graves (2003), Blackie left Root to concentrate on his band Cales. Blackie also played in side-project Entrails, an old school black-thrash metal band.

2) Root was the name of a Polish grunge band

3) Root is an Australian country rock band. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Root">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
