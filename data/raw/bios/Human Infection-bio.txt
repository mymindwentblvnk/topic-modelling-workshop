Human Infection was formed in September of 2009 when friends Andrew Mathews, Hank James, and CJ Giles decided to form a death metal band out of their love for the genre. Soon after the three started writing songs, vocalist Tony Evans came along and became a member of the band. Human Infection would then record their first demo in November of that year. The demo features the first four songs that were written and a Dying Fetus cover of "Kill Your Mother, Rape Your Dog". Soon after recording, the band played the Day Of Death Fest III, in Rochester, NY. Next they traveled to Milwaukee, WI, to play the third annual Midwest Fuckest with Dying Fetus, Misery Index, Arsis, and Annotations Of An Autopsy. After returning home, a few shows were played here and there. Soon after, vocalist Tony Evans decided to leave the band for personal reasons. After Tony's departure, the band then recruited Andrew Brown for vocals. At this point the band decided to begin writing for their first album, to be titled "Infest To Ingest". The album is planned to be released in early 2011.
