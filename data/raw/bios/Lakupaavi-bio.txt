Lakupaavi is the politically incorrect side project including the members of Moonsorrow, a Finnish folk metal band. Lakupaavi's grindcore sound however differs notably from Moonsorrow's general style.

Their sole album, Raah Raah Blääh, has been released only in .mp3, and it can be freely downloaded here, along with its cover art.
