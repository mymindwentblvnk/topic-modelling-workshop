There're two Corpse Vomit bands, both have split up. The first Corpse Vomit was formed in 1990, the band consisted of five men from Denmark by the time they put out their first full length album. The second was from America, releasing "Raping the ears of above" 2001. The original Denmark band's music style was in tribute to Autopsy, which they done a cover track of "Gasping for air", ultimately they have an old-school death metal sound. They wrote songs about bestiality, porno and gore. Their only release was delayed for a long amount of time due to their label "Mighty Music" refusing to issue it because of the album covers art work, after a long time of waiting the label did finally release the album, "Drowning in puke", 1999. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Corpse+Vomit">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
