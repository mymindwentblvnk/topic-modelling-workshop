Pablo Nouvelle is a moniker for Fabio Friedli from Bern, Switzerland. A former architecture student turned film-maker and musician, Fabio makes songs from a combination of new sounds and old samples. He works under the name Pablo Nouvelle, out of a love of the French cinematic nouvelle vague of the late 1950s and early 1960s.

'Is It OK' was his first single, from the 2013 début "Pablo Nouvelle" on Feraltone. It was followed by "You don't understand" on Black Butter Records and "Heartbeat" with Norma Jean Martine, again on Feraltone (2014). A further EP, "Take me to a place" was released in 2015 on Black Butter Records.

The début album "All I Need" was released in January 2016 via Armada Music and it features vocals by Sam Wills, James Gruntz, Josef Salvat, Liv and Lulu James amongst others.
