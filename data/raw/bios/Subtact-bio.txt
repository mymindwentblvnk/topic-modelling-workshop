Ben Walker, better known by his moniker, Subtact, has been producing electronic music since he was ten years old. Beginning with a fascination with synthesis and sampling, he began working with makeshift software to produce sounds and put them together every chance he got. With a deep understanding of music since he picked up drums at age eight, Ben has continued to develop his skills and knowledge of music production into art that now captivates listeners from around the globe. 

By blending more conventional songwriting with new approaches to sound design and fresh musical perspectives, Subtact gives listeners a chance to hear and feel something different. Taking from his huge number of influences, he melds together detuned synths, catchy melodies, and unpredictable atmospheres to create a truly unique concoction of sound. Whether being heard by millions worldwide with established networks like Monstercat, NoCopyrightSounds, and others or releasing his more creative work on his own label, Kaleido, Subtact creates new takes on electronic music and continues to turn heads with his music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Subtact">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
