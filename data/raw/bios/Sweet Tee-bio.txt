Sweet Tee (born Toi Jackson) is a rapper who signed to MCA Records in the 1980s. She scored minor chart success with her debut album It's Tee Time which peaked at number thirty-one on the US R&B album chart in 1988. Sweet Tee and her partner Jazzy Joyce influenced other female rappers, including Queen Latifah who remarked that she hadn't considered it possible to be a female rapper until she saw Sweet Tee rap and how popular she was in east coast nightclubs and parties. 

She scored four chart hits from her debut "I Got da Feelin'" (#48/R&B, #31 UK Singles Chart), "On the Smooth Tip" (#36/R&B) and "Why Did It Have to Be Me". In the UK the single "It's Like That Y'All" peaked in the top forty.

I Got da Feelin' formed the basis of a piano based House anthem by UK based act Tin Tin Out who sampled/used Sweet Tee's lyrics in their track The Feeling which reached #32 in the UK Singles Chart.
