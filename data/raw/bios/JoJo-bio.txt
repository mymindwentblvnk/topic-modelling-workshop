Joanna NoÃ«lle Levesque (born December 20, 1990 in Brattleboro, VT) , known professionally as JoJo, is an American singer, songwriter, and actress. Raised in Foxborough, Massachusetts, she began performing in singing competitions and local talent shows from a young age. In 2003, record producer Vincent Herbert noticed her after she competed on the television show America's Most Talented Kids and asked her to audition for his record label Blackground Records. Having signed with them that same year, JoJo released her eponymous debut studio album the following year in June 2004. It peaked at number four on the US Billboard 200 and was later certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), selling over four million copies worldwide to date. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/JoJo">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
