Meneguar (pronounced MEN-EGG-WHAR)[1] is an indie rock band from Brooklyn, NY, that started in the winter of 2004. After years of playing together in other projects, such as Sheryl's Magnetic Aura, which has an abundance of recordings dating back a number of years, Christian Deroeck, Jeremy Earl, Justin Wertz and Jarvis Taveniere, as Meneguar, released their demo on Fuck It Tapes in late 2004.  They then moved into a small house in Bushwick and began work on what would eventually become I Was Born at Night. Recorded with their gloves on in an under-heated practice space in 4 hour blocks, the record came out in a limited pressing on May 10th 2005. Once that went out of print they remixed it and released it on Troubleman Unlimited along with a 7" of 2 new songs. 

Since then they've toured extensively, released 2 cassettes on Fuck-it-tapes and recently finished a 7 inch for Troubleman Unlimited (OUT NOW!!!). Nicolas Vernhes (Silver Jews, Fiery Furnaces, Les Savy Fav) remixed the album in the winter of 2005 at his Rare Book Room studio in Greenpoint. This summer marked the release of the remixed, remastered record on Troubleman Unlimited. "Satan had foretold its release on June 6th, 2006 on CD/LP."  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Meneguar">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
