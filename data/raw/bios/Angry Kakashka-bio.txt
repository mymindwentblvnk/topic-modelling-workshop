Formed in 1999 Ukrainian alco-grind band Angry Kakashka had started spreading the spirit of anus among metalheads. Brutal riffs influenced by vodka, plus beer and sharp anti-social pro-dibil lyrics make Angry Kakashka an outstanding figure in grindcore with their own unique sound. Their name, 'Angry Kakashka' which means 'Angry Shit', appropriately defines the style of music and lyrics this band produces.
