Harrison Brome is a vocalist and songwriter whose material consists of predominantly low-key, slightly left-of-center variations on contemporary R&B, pop, and dance music.

A Vancouver, British Columbia native, Brome was exposed at an early age to classic soul through his mother. He wrote his first song at the age of 14 and, just prior to completing high school, dropped out to pursue music full-time. A dusty and sparse ballad titled "Fill Your Brains" appeared on Kitsun√© Maison 17: World Wild Issue in 2015. Shortly after his 20th birthday, in July 2016, "Fill Your Brains" became the title track of his debut EP. The six-track set was released through a deal arranged with Nettwerk, the long-running label based in Brome's hometown. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Harrison+Brome">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
