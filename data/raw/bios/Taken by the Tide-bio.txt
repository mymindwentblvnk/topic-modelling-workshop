Nottingham Tech-Metal crew, Taken by the tide formed in early 2009. Tired of rehashed metalcore Riffs and rehashed beatdowns, they aim to mix things up with more progressive and technical ideas, whilst keeping grounded and groove laden. 
The Debut release, "There is no such thing as an atheist in a foxhole" is due for general and online release on October 5th 2010 on Bad news records.

Rock sound issue 140: The debut EP from Nottingham Tech-metallers already sounds like it has been made by a band further into their career, rather than being together for little over a year. splicing eerie samplings from film recordings throughout, Alan rickman leads in to the deathly bile of "She looks like a dead heat in a zepplin race", the band successfully break up the constant mind abuse of experimental playing, setting the calm before the storm.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Taken+by+the+tide">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
