Fronted by guitarist/vocalist Matt Hollywood, the former co-songwriter and co-founder of The Brian Jonestown Massacre, fans of mid-'60s Kinks, Stones, and Byrds will fall in love with The Out Crowd's edgy and infectious pop sound, heightened by Dandy Warhols' producer Gregg Willliams' immaculate production. The Big Takeover raves: "Portland, OR's Out Crowd makes music that reaches for the sky, going for those heavenly ideas just out of reach. Building off the great Psych foundations of LA pop, (Byrds, Love, Rain Parade,) one moment and a Stonesy Velvets base the next, they push themselves to the creative max, with a sound that is always clean and aggressive. But don't think its urgent-style Punk, instead its Rock from a bunch who remain in control even as they go for brokeï¿½" 

Heavy, grinding trip rock that occasionally pounds your poor little brain so hard that you'll think somebody slipped you a crack suppository. The group, out of Portland, features Matt Hollywood, formerly of The Brian Jonestown Massacre. For those of you unclear on such things, that would be the guy who did not try to kill people with mic stand at shows. Check out Little Elf and 4 Lines/3 Drugs for a taste -- the band has some free mp3 files on its site. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Out+Crowd">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
