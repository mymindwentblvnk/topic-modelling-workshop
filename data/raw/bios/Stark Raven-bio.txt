Craig Markley and David Reddick founded Stark Raven in the summer of 1993 as a refreshing alternative to the various styles of rock, blues, and jazz music that they had performed previously. They eventually connected with Sid Omasta, a jazz bassist who was searching for an outlet to pursue his fiddling and mandolin interests.  Several months later, Beckie Boger joined the trio lending her flute, guitar, and vocal talents.  In 1995, the band completed it’s present line-up with Sue Mogan Mattison, who contributes yet another color to the band's vocal and instrumental arrangements with her extensive background in Celtic vocal and dance. It is the diversity of these musical backgrounds that lends to Stark Raven's unique sound.  The band’s original arrangements are completely unique and, while a traditional sound is favored, ele-ments of jazz, folk, and world music are often blended with the band’s five-part vocal harmonies and soaring instrumentals.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Stark+Raven">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
