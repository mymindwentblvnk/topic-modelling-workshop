Melodic extreme metal band with doom, black, and death metal elements, -  2009- present near Boston, MA.  Influenced by bands including Opeth, Amorphis,  Dimmu Borgir,  Cradle of Filth, Slayer, Type O Negative, and Therion, Sorrowseed's primary subject matter is that of the apocalypse and the ultimate destruction of mankind.

Sorrowseed's double-disc album "The Extinction Prophecies", released in 2011, chronicles the reckoning brought upon by the Reaping Willow (portrayed by Lilith Astaroth). Once an avatar of the goddess Demeter, the Willow was a tree of wisdom. When mankind rejected her fruit, she wept for their ignorance and became the Weeping Willow. Now that mankind is bringing about the ruination of the planet and spreading like a disease, she has gone mad with wrath, sprouted blades and set out for mankind's extinction. The songs illustrate her duality and insanity, going between absolute sorrow for the fallen human race and undiluted anger for their crimes against nature.

Sorrowseed underwent heavy lineup changes throughout 2010 and 2011, and now consists of the following members:

Lilith Astaroth - vocals
Morte McAdaver - rhythm guitar 
Gr√ºne - bass
Eric Pellegrini - lead guitar 
Promethius Subrick - drums

In June 2016, shortly following their summer US tour with Infested Prophecy, Sorrowseed announced their return to the studio to record their 3rd full-length album.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sorrowseed">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
