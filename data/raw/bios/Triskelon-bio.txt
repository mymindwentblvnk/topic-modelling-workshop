Triskelon was a freedom rock band from Trollhättan, Sweden. The band only existed for a brief period in the late 90's but thanks to their innovatory music they managed to cement their place in Swedish nationalist music history.

They released two full-length CD's:
Endast Mörker (1997)
Vrede (1998)

Members of the band later went on to play in Symphony of Sorrow, Frostfödd, Blod & Ära and Ledung. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Triskelon">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
