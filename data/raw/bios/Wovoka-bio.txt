2. Wovoka is the psych folk vehicle for one John Tar, by all accounts a splendid fellow making wonderful music. If one can judge another by the company he keeps, judgment falls glowingly on Mr. Tar -- he's played with or supported Devendra Banhart, Vetiver, Sir Richard Bishop, Jack Rose, Comets on Fire, and Howlin' Rain.

3. A Polish band that plays roots music, a bit of psychedelia, blues intertwining with indian folk. The band consists of 4-members; Raphael Rogiński (guitar), Mewa Chabiera (vocal), Ola Rzepka (organs), Paweł Szpura (drums).
