MAÏA VIDAL uses violins, accordion, guitar, percussion, toy instruments and her distinctive, moving voice  to compose and arrange her own unique music.

She blends modern, confident songwriting with shades of old world melodies, and takes us on a journey that is at once sweet and painfully honest, yet never loses its sense of wonderment.

God Is My Bike, a fresh and surprisingly mature debut album for such a young artist, was recorded in Barcelona. Giuliano Gius Cobelli engineered, coproduced and played the trumpet and the drums. Marc Ribot played guitar on two songs. MAÏA sang and played all the other instruments.

This album is MAÏA VIDAL’s second recording, after Poison, a self-released EP she recorded under the name Your Kid Sister, which contained versions of punk anthems by Rancid transformed into haunting lullabies and plaintive waltzes, a homage to the songs MAÏA loved as a teenager.

MAÏA shares her time between New York & Paris. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Maia+Vidal">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
