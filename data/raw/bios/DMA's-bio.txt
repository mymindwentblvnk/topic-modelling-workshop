DMA’s (dee-em-ayes) is an Australian rock trio: Johnny Took, Matt Mason and Tommy O’Dell, three friends who came together making nostalgic garage pop in a bedroom in Newtown.

Having met whilst playing in other bands, the boys decided to take the helm of a project that was dear to all their hearts. Three writers, three mates – three frontmen if you will – all with a common sense of purpose and musicality.

After writing a few songs as DMA’s, they demoed them in Johnny’s bedroom-studio, gaining instant attention - all before putting out an official track or playing a single show.

After signing with tastemaker label I OH YOU (Violent Soho, Snakadaktal, DZ Deathrays), DMA’s released their debut single “Delete” to rave reviews, with Channel V calling them “the next big thing”, and Triple J adding the track to rotation.

DMA’s debut EP is out now through I OH YOU. Expect big things in 2014. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/DMA%27s">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
