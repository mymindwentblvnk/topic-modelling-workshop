Sleeping Woodland was formed in Russian town Michurinsk in 2004. Musicians of this band like to combine folk melodies with metal guitar riffs and other atmospheric things that creating very emotional pictures of their compositions. Guys choose this way because they prefer to listen epic music and watch films full of fantasy, adventures and brave heroes. Their music is the world of the Eternal winter…and Northern fairytales…Hear it…touch it…feel it. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sleeping+Woodland">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
