The history of Chaos Infinitum starts from the spring of 2002 in Kilteri Upper Comprehensive School. Three bored guys called Dani, Tuomas and Antti started to play metal together. During the following summer Tuomas's long-time friend, Yk√§, agreed to play bass in the band.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Chaos+Infinitum">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
