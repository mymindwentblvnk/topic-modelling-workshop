Hellish Crossfire was formed in 2002 in Nuremberg, Germany; and take their name from a seminal album by the speed metal band Iron Angel.  Unashamedly old-school, they released one demo before being signed by I Hate Records from Sweden, and released their debut first on LP format only in 2006, before releasing it on CD in 2007, with different cover art. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hellish+Crossfire">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
