Thromdarr is a Finnish band performing aggressive and poetic metal music. Stylistically Thromdarr enriches the greatness of the heavy and thrash metal of the 80's with the death and black metal nuances. Extremely heavy guitar walls and beautiful keyboard melodies complete the experience. 

Thromdarr has been around since the late 80's and now they are stronger than ever with a new powerful line-up. The troops of Thromdarr have been fortified with a new singer, a second guitarist and a keyboardist. As a result of the updated line-up, the stories are now told with the aggression and agony they should be told with.
