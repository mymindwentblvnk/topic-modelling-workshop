Pray is an underground artist from Ft. Collins, CO. Pray performed as a guitarist/singer in bands most of his childhood before finally finding his niche in hip-hop/rock/anything production and songwriting. Pray teamed up in the early 2000's to work alongside Denver rappers the A.M.B. ( Hatchet House Records) working as a crew member and producer for several years before signing to A.M.B.'s own label Canonize Productions. Pray appeared as a feature artist on A.M.B.'s 2008 national release "God's Hand" from Hatchet House Records (a sub-label of Detroit's infamous Psychopathic Records) as well as provided production for several tracks on the release. He appeared on the labels compilation release "Canonize: The Mixtape Vol. 1" with 2 solo tracks as well as a song from the group project of Pray and A.M.B. "Karmakazi". Pray released his much anticipated full length record entitled "Save Yourself" February 2nd, 2010 and has since been performing non-stop to promote the release. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pray">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
