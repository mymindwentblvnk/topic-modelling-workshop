Somewhere in 2001 F.U.B.A.R. started as a grindcore / mincecore band called I scream: Protest. We only played two gigs. After some line up and musical chances we recorded our first demo under the name of F.U.B.A.R. It saw the light of day in the beginning of 2002. Whit a demo in hands we started to play as much and fast as possible. Soon after we started to write new songs for a split with American grinders, Catheter. It was released somewhere in 2003. After a lot of show and some small tours with Ohlo de Gato and then Matka Teresa we decided to release a tape with some home and live recordings and a split 7 inch with them.   
2005 was a good year for F.U.B.A.R., we recorded and released our first full length, full of power violence and punk influenced grindcore, on Bones Brigade Records. After that we did a tour in Brazil. Back home we started to work on an split with our friends of Blood I Bleed. And after having seen Splitter play we decided it also would be very nice to do a split with them. That one was releases sometime in 2008. We did a few small European tours, one on our own because UK grinders Fuck That were not allowed to leave the country and one with Jesus Crost. We played Hellfest a few UK tours and a lot of shows around Europe. In 2009 we recorded splits with Sylvester Staline and K.S.K. In 2010 we did a release with Lycanthrophy. And finaly after too many years, we are planning to release  a new full length in 2012.
