The mastermind behind Muscaria is Thomas Wiesinger, located in Austria. Introduced to the psychadelic music scene in 2000, he started djing in 2004. After paricipating many parties, he began to make his own sound in 2006. He describes his sound as experimental psychadelic sound, using many different hardware synth's, taking a lot of insperation from oldschool sounds of the early 90's.

When he first got in touch with psychedelic music he had a feeling of goosebumps, of diving into another dimension where space and time becomes lost, and for the first time he knew what people meant when they said "to be between worlds". This is the key to his music: Muscaria wants to send you on a journey, to make you gain experience, but most importantly to immerse you in his inner world and tell you his stories. There is a lot going on in this wondrous and adventurous land, so let's venture into the imaginary realms and see what can be heard!
