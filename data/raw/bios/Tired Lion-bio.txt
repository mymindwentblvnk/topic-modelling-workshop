Led by the irresistible voice of Sophie Hopes, Tired Lion's contribution to the lineage of great guitar rock has all the right boxes ticked: it is familiar but innovative, catchy but substantial, and the rare and perfect occasion where the distinctiveness of each individual musician doesn't inhibit their ability to work as a team.

Bursting out of the speakers with style and charm, 'All We Didn't Know' is a smashing introduction to the world from an exceptionally promising band.

Forming in 2011 and then debuting a year later with haunting single For The Wolfman, Tired Lion have worked hard and smart from the get-go, earning a swag of glowing reviews for their live shows, a spot on the Homebake festival, and their first wave of true, diehard fans. Finding a musical soulmate in producer Andy Lawson, Tired Lion took to the studio in 2013 to produce All We Didn't Know and its lead single Desperate â€“ which was launched to a sell-out hometown crowd in July.
