Norseth was created in 2000 by Kevin Carr, AJ Grimes, and Nicholas Landmesser. The core group released an EP, The Hexed Enigma, in 2004 and continued playing through 2005. The band then went on an indefinite hiatus.

In early 2012, Kevin Carr and AJ Grimes began writing music together again. Shortly thereafter, they began self-recording material and releasing their music online. The pair is working towards having enough material for a full-length album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Norseth">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
