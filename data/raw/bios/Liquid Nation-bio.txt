Liquid Nation is the slighty more electronic edged alter-ego of the 'Bassmonkeys' and consists of producer Dale Askew, Danny Bond, & Mike Chenery, all of who come from Norwich, UK.

Liquid Nation are fast becoming one of the most respected production teams in the UK and are the subject of constant attention from the Worlds hottest dance labels all in search of consistently great remixes and productions.
Creatively and individually these guys have been working in the dance scene for over 15 years creating quality club anthem under many various guises. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Liquid+Nation">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
