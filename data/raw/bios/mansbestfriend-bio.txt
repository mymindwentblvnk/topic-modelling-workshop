Mansbestfriend is one of several aliases used by prominent Anticon Collective member Tim Holland (best known as Sole). The alias has, to date, been used for self-titled EPs, which Holland has self-produced with the help of fellow Anticon member Odd Nosdam. The emphasis in these EPs is on Holland's production, and mansbestfriend is cited by Holland himself as a project primarily focused on beat-making before rapping. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mansbestfriend">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
