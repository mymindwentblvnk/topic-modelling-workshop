Began as a concept, a one man band composed by Ark and in the composition of the first songs, the decision to let other members in the band for the recording of the first four songs. After some tests the project becomes a real group and in August of the same year the first gig. After only two months of activity comes the first contract offer, and in October 2011 the Ulvedharr sign for a management contract which will bring them to engraving of the first EP (Viking Tid) and European tour with Blood red Throne and Cattle Decapitation.
