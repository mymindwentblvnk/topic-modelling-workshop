Gustavo D’Arthenay, better known as Input, is a well-known Denver-based hip-hop artist. His
unique blend of rhythm based music and direct lyrics – as well as his commitment to his fans – has made him one of Denver’s most popular rappers and has helped him gain a devout local following.

First and foremost, Input is a music fan. His appreciation and passion for rap and hip-hop serve
as the motivation behind his music. Input’s goal is simple: to create music that people, as a whole,
can appreciate and relate to; straightforward music that makes sense. He is known for his ability
to pair unique beats with uncomplicated, personal lyrics – creating music that resonates with
listeners.

Since his first album, Input has demonstrated the work ethic and artistic drive that has made him
such a highly regarded artist. His release, “Elusive Candor,” dropped in 2006 and marked an
evolutionary shift into a new wave of hip-hop. In 2007, Input released "A Radio With Guts,” which
he followed up in 2008 with the fan favorite, "Pictureface.” After a 30-city tour, he thanked his fans by releasing "Unreleased & Unrelenting" and “Lessons Learned” as free downloads.

Input has just released his new full-length album, "Left For Dead." The new album, which
features several popular artists, is Input’s first collaboration with producer Broken. Speaking
to the new album, Input said, “I have explored my deepest emotions and demons to create
something that I am more than proud of. This album will speak volumes of my personal growth
and accomplishments over the past 5 years of music.” With this highly anticipated album, Input is
poised to become an internationally recognized artist – something that won't come as a surprise to his current fans. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Input">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
