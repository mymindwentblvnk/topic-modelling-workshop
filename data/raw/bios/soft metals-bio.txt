Soft Metals is an electronic duo from Portland, Oregon now residing in Los Angeles, California. Members Ian Hicks and Patricia Hall began writing and recording music together in the spring of 2009. Influence came to them by way of experimental electronic sounds, film soundtracks, early industrial music, minimal synth, house, techno, synth pop, krautrock, psychedelic rock, and shoegaze. Their songs are built from moody, improvised sessions together using exclusively electronic instruments- mostly analog and vintage.  

Soft Metals is signed to Captured Tracks and released their first record, an 5 song EP titled “The Cold World Melts” in July 2010. Their debut self-titled album came out in July of 2011. FACT magazine called Soft Metals “one of the most accomplished and ambitious of the myriad new synth-pop acts coming out of the States.” The duo have played shows on both coasts of the US and in Mexico City. They have shared the stage with bands ranging from HEALTH and Nitzer Ebb to Glass Candy and Chromatics.
