MNESIS, experimental electronic music project formed by Federico Gamarra, has taken us to cross the kafkian paths of our psyche. The multiple aspects of the individual's personality, its obsessions, inner fights, the contradictions that the social schizophrenia in which it manages imposes; are ingredients of the finished musical formula that MNESIS tries to capture in its trajectory.

MNESIS, which means "memory," is based in very different music styles, such as most of electronic music, regional Paraguayan folk music (polca, guarania), urban pop, ambient, techno, dance, trip-hop, rock, hardcore, drum'n'bass, new age and experimental.

Each work has a different artistic concept based in memories and experiences kept inside the mind. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mnesis">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
