There is more than one artist named Free For All:

1) Free For All was a pop-punk band from Dallas, Texas. After many line-up changes they have decided to change their name to thirtyseven: http://www.myspace.com/thirtyseventx

2) Free For All is a tight mismatched three piece old school punk band who wanna take over Auckland, New Zealand. "Free For All is full of energy and are as tight as Arnold's buttcheeks (when he was in his prime, none of this govenator business). Free For All is all about the kids, we're sick of seeing kids down and out around and try our hardest to say, Oi! to the broken hearted! We're gonna make it though today. Free For All is Pete Marcus and Shawn, a crazy punk, a man with two minute noodles for hair, and a maths guy from New Mexico." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Free+For+All">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
