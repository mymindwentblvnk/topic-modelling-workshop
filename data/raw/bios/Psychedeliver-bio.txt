Hailing from the wretched industrial town of Äänekoski, Psychedeliver was founded in 2011 at the concrete bunker where Henu and Otto had been rehearsing. "I've had this idea of a doom metal band", Henu stated and Otto was in right away. After a couple of hours first groovy songs were created, constantly growing towards stoner rock still preserving the doomy mood.

In the absence of lyrical expressionist and a bass maestro, dudes thought that songs would soon lose their edge. Search for vocalist lasted about five minutes and that many beers after which Juho from local garage/action rock group Chainerection joined the two. His dark, psychedelic lyrics combined with strong voice gave the band a soul. By the end of the year, Antti (also from Chainerection) perfected Psychedeliver's soundscape with booming bass.

With stoner rock basis, Psychedeliver adopts musical aspects with criteria "not shit". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Psychedeliver">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
