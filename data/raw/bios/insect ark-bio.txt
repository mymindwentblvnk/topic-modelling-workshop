INSECT ARK started as a the one-woman solo project of bassist/multi-instrumentalist Dana Schechter (M. Gira's Angels of Light, Bee and Flower). Formed in late 2011, Insect Ark has been building a following in the experimental/doom/drone scene in both her hometown of NYC and internationally.

In January 2015, San Francisco-based drummer Ashley Spungin (Taurus) joined on drums and synthesizers.
