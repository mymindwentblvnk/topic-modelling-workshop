Zombie Corpse Autopsy was formed in late 2004 and has been going strong ever since. We have written well over 30 songs at this point and just release the EP "The Great Chain Of Slaughter." We write all of our music on one computer in Tehachapi California. We use Cubase and Acoustica Beatcraft... We are currently writing a full-length CD entitled "The Bereavement," so be on the lookout for that early '08!!!! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Zombie+Corpse+Autopsy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
