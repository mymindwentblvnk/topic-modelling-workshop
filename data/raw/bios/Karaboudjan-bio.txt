Karaboudjan was a short-lived sideproject by Dan Swan√∂ that sounds much like an instrumental version of Pan.Thy.Monium with the ridiculously distorted guitars and psychotic use of a saxophone. Likely also the only metal band to be influenced the Belgian comic Tintin - the songs are named after the comic books and contain samples from the Swedish dubs of the Tintin movies. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Karaboudjan">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
