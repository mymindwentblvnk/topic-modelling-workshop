The metal solo project from UNC Alumnus and musician Ian Urbaitis. Experimenting with all sorts of heavy genres from an apartment in Chapel Hill. Look for self-produced, self-released material through this page.

After being a part of numerous projects, some metal and some not, Ian has decided to create music on his own. Influenced by all music, The White Tomb is the metal outlet for his creativity. All recordings are done on a laptop with budget gear in a small apartment in Chapel Hill, NC.
