There are 2 bands with the name Pulse 8.

1.   Pulse 8 is a secretive studio collective from England.  Combining smooth layers of sound and blending them into a retro flavoured mix of smooth Electro Synth.

The "Pulse 8 Theme" is the first track from their album, "Alive".


2.  Since its birth in June of 2000, Pulse8 has been equipped to put Cincinnati music on the map. The Cincinnati five piece concentrates on heart pounding rhythms and choruses that stick with you. The bandâ€™s frontman Doug Carter, is the essence of insanity. With Screams that chill you to the bone and verses that make you move to the beat. Doug is the perfect blend for the future of vocals as they are known. Doug is backed by the dynamic duo of brothers Damon and Scott Mocahbee, who lay down the thickest and heaviest guitar tones needed to put the pulse in to Pulse8. Last, but not least by any means, are Scott Amiott and Eddie Black. They hold down the concrete stonewall rhythm section that raises your feet off of the floor. Pulse8, given the chance, will definitely be a heavyweight contender in the NEW music era!!
