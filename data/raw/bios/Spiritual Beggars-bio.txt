Spiritual Beggars are a stoner rock/metal band from Halmstad, Sweden. They formed in 1992 and debuted with a self-titled album in 1994. 

Spiritual Beggars are basically a reversion to true rock roots. Although this is no-way a retrogression of musical techniques. They offer intelligent and burnished pieces of euphony, that come across like a junkie of groove. In other words a musical drug, an addictive blend of severity and harmony.
