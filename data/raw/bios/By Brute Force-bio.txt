By Brute Force was formed in the summer of '01 by Simon Milizia (Guitar, Vocals/ex-Diabolical Imperium), Aldo Mancarella (Drums, Vocals/ex-Morbus Crohn) and Andreas Höpfner (Bass/ex-Morbus Crohn). Those three Thrash-Maniacs decided to be the heaviest death-circle in their home-hood. Along this time the band celebrated some stuff, gigs, songs and a demo-cd. Short time before the band planed to record the first album, bass-player Höpfner breaks with the band, so that BBF was a duo for the rest of the year 2002. So on Simon and Aldo concepted a new band profile with classical 4-men-power. In December 0f '02 the band contacted former Streetcore Logo guitar-warrior Dr. Michel Gasmask to come in BBF. With this constelation By Brute Force recorded his first album, just called "By Brute Force", in March of 2003. One month later the band finally had found a new bass-crusher: Gasmasks' ol' Streetcore logo buddy Punki "Punkster" Punker! From this on By Brute Force made a lot of gigs everywhere in Germany; the Debut-Album became ..1 of Demo-CD's in Metal Hammer 11/03 and of course the band wrote new death-torpedos.... at the end of october 06, Simon get put of the band, and our grindtorpedo Oskar, get in the band, and riffin´ the 6-sting-warlock-torpedo. THE NEW BEGIN, OF BRUTALITY is now Second Album "Rituals of Death" was recorded in the beginning of 2005. It will be published in July this year. "Rituals of Death" contents a high-brutal mixture of old death metal roughness, mosh stomping hardcore punches, up-blasting grindcore tornados with the technical demand od good ol' 80's Thrash.
