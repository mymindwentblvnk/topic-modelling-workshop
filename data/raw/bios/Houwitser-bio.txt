HOUWITSER plays Death Metal in the classic sense, bottom heavy, blasting but with a slight groove, complete with lyrics of gore and murder.

They are a Dutch band that was formed in 1997 by members of SINISTER; Aad, Mike, Michel and Theo from JUDGEMENT DAY. In that same year HOUWITSER recorded a promo with 6 songs and in June 1998, HOUWITSER signed to a Dutch record label: Displeased Records

Their debut "Death...But Not Buried" was released in the spring of 1999 and got great reviews all over the world. Before recording their next album HOUWITSER parted from singer Mike and found a replacement in singer Arjaan "Djortzzz". With him they recorded their second album "Embrace Damnation" After an intense promotional tour and a video clip a second guitar player (Alex from SINISTER) was added to their line-up. In 2000, Arjaan "Djortzzz" announced to leave the band due lack of time and devotion. A few months later Stan was introduced as the new singer of HOUWITSER.

February 2001, HOUWITSER signed a deal with Osmose Productions and in July of that same year HOUWITSER recorded their 3rd album "Rage Inside The Womb" a masterpiece of pure Death Metal, introducing the extremely brutal voice of Stan. In 2002 just before a huge and successful European tour, Michel announced to leave HOUWITSER and the band continued as a four piece. With this line-up HOUWITSER recorded their fourth album "Damage Assessment" and is set for release September 2003. "Damage Assessment"â€¦ a one fuck all blistering Death Metal highlight.
