The band was founded in summer 2002 by Igor Cherepanov (guitars), Natalia Nazarova (keyboards) and Ivan Cherednichenko (vocals). Drummer Igor Ryabtsev joined the band in a couple of rehearsals. In August of 2004 the bass-guitarist Denis Tkalichev accomplished the present band line-up.

Their very first two tracks "Vampire to Become" and "Funeral of Last Hope" were recorded in the end of the year 2003 the last one was released on CD Wolfsong Compilation Vol.1 in year 2004. 

The first promo-CD "Sex in Heaven" was recorded at Shaddar Studio (Kiev) in December 2004. It was kept in emotional gothic/doom convention and got good reviews both in underground and official music press such as Metalworks Magazine (Ireland), Legion Magazine (Belarus), Terroraiser Magazine (Ukraine), Neformat Zine and by many Web Portals as Froster Online, The Metallist Portal, Hellraiser, Doom-Metal, Gothic-Nights and many others. The material was presented in music press, radio and TV.

After playing numerous gigs, which also included GRIMFAITH’s 1st show outside Ukraine (Funeral of Last Hope Fest, Moldova), the band decides to record their debut full length album, entitled "Grime". The album is recorded at Morton Studio (Kiev) in years 2005-2006 and contains 10 tracks of climatic gothic/doom metal, with cover version "In Lust" Finnish band POISONBLACK as a bonus song. 

Special guest musician on the album: Koen Romeijn – vocalist of the Dutch death/thrash metal band DETONATION and guitarist of the gothic/rock band CARDAMON. Brilliant artwork was provided by famous artist Vjacheslav Nurgeslag (FLYING, TANGORODREAM, MOURNFUL GUST, VENEREAL MESSIAH, HAEMOPHOBIA).

In year 2008 GRIMFAITH finally signs a record-deal with major label Moon Records from Ukraine for one album. "Grime" is officially released only for the territory of Ukraine on the 15 of May 2008.

A video for the storming track "Guttiere (Secret of the Sea)" is being filmed and will be submitted to all relevant channels.                                                 

Currently GRIMFAITH are writing new material for a second full length album. Already 6 songs have been finished, and plenty of good ideas aside to fill the new album. The new work is turning out more heavy and atmospheric than ever before. The history goes on…
