Spirit Of Rebellion was created in 2001 at Rimouski (Qc, Canada). After many changes in the line-up and 2 demos, the band has completed the final touch to its first album “Common Peace Denied” containing 8 pieces and centered on the grip of the slumbering human race. In their own Death metal style, the band proposes a raw and direct sound. At the image of the Ouroboros that links present times and ancient mythologies, S.O.R conserves an aura of mystery, reminding the infernal cycle of history that repeats itself again and again. Like a battle against the venom injected in modern society, slumbering and enslaved.
