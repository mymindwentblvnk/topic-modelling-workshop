In 1982, at the age of only 22, Michal Turtle set up a portable four track studio in his family's South London home, over-running his parents' front room with synthesizers, amps and instruments. He he would create layered and deeply hypnotic tracks that were often built around live jams with musicians he would invite to his home. Although the music can appear to be sample based, all instruments were played live and any voices or sound effects were recorded directly to tape or from tiny cassette loops. Combining electronics with live percussion throughout. The results reflect a deep sense of musical exploration and creates a uniquely other-wordly musical language of its own. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Michal+Turtle">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
