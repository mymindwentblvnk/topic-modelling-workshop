TUMMO comes from Brno (Czech Republic). Ex-members of More bad news, Ema Camelia, See you in hell and Gospel of the future. The word "tummo" usually means the intense sensations of body heat or an inner body fire. Down-tuned hardcore/punk/stoner metal with personal/political lyrics and DIY attitude.
