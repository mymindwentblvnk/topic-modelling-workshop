Yonder Realm was founded in the summer of 2009 by Jesse McGunnigle and Edward Delinden on the Long Isle, New York as a side project from their melodic death metal band inRed. The demo Reclaiming the Throne (Of Madness) was released and soon a live line up took form with the band's newly aquired bass player Harley Wootton(inRed) and guitar player Jorge Dominguez in 2010. Soon after, the band parted... ways with co-founder and drummer Edward Delinden and Harley Wootton and the search for a new live line up began. Drummer Scott Burgess and bass player Adam Carella answered the call and joined the band during late 2010 completing the first official line up to begin playing live. The recording of the first ever Yonder Realm EP began immediatley and was finished within the summer of 2011. The EP titled Beyond a Long Lost World will be available October 7th, 2011 through Looney Tunes CD's.
