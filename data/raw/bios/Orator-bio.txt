There are three bands with this name:

1. Death/Thrash Metal from Bangladesh.

Orator was formed in the year 2008 AD after tearing apart the demiurgic womb of Barzak.Rejecting the foul prayers of the filthy demiurge and being inspired by their Ancestors who were mostly Kapalikas and Aghoris, the orators have taken up their trishuls to preach the ancient tantric doctrines.Uttering ominous creeds they have chosen this path of liberation and to indoctrinate the hylic mortals with the gnosis of immortality.To some extent Orator also preaches the hidden black gnosis of Qliphoth, keeping it within the limitations of secrecy.
