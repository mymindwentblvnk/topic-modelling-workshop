Alek Darson discovered his passion for music in his Serbian home when he picked up his mom's old nylon string guitar at age of 10. He's always been drawn to aggressive, melodic and emotional music and moves easily between virtuoso guitarist and producer.

Alek became part of the progressive metal project Organized Chaos in 2005 as a guitar player, arranger and producer. His playing had a strong impact on his colleagues, which led to performances with numerous famous Serbian artists, frequent tours, TV shows and videos.

Growing up in Belgrade in the 90s left many emotional marks on Alek's mind and soul, and to better express his complex feelings he travelled to Berklee College of Music to perfect his composition skills, and now calls Boston home.
