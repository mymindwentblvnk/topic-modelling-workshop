Quest Of Aidance is a Death metal/ grindcore band from Skövde, Sweden. Quest of Aidance was formed by the very well known multi-vocalist Christian Älvestam (drums) and Christian Lundgren (guitar). 
Once the material for the debut-demo "Human Trophy" started to take shape, Christan Älvestam changed from drums to guitar and vocals and it was not long before the duo had turned into a quartet, where Anders Johansson (bass and backing vocals) and Henrik Schönström (drums) completed the line-up. 

They've released one demo & two EP's so far.
Human Trophy - 2005
Fallen Man Collection - 2006
Dark Are the Skies at Hand - 2007
