The inceptive roots of Cryptica date back to 2005 when a couple of thrash-influenced guys decided to form a band of their own. Villu Uustalu and Roland Vinni discovered that their old friend Kuldar Peedo was a skilled drummer and asked to join. While having a hard time finding a place to rehearse, they met a talented bass guitarist Andrei Krapivinitski. In 2006 the band did their first small gigs, consisted mostly of covers, and still without a vocalist. Later, both Villu and Roland would do the singing and start writing their own material. In 2007 Cryptica was officially formed and started doing gigs in local pubs and bars.

Since then, Cryptica has performed around major cities in Estonia. Some changes have been made to the line-up, such as a recently joined vocalist. Cryptica continues to deliver some groovy tunes to the ears of local listeners. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cryptica">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
