The Heavy Metal Kids were formed in 1973 by the merger of two previous bands: Heaven and Biggles. They took their name from a gang of street kids featured in a novel by legendary beat generation writer William Burroughs.

The initial, pre-recording line-up consisted of Mickey Waller (Guitar), Ronnie Thomas (Bass and Vocals), Gary Holton (Lead Vocals), Keith Boyce (Drums) and Cosmo (Guitar).  They were the first signing by Atlantic Records' new London offices, having been spotted by A & R man and sixties legend, Dave Dee.

In January 1974 they recorded their first, self-titled album, produced by Dave Dee and engineered by Phil Chapman.  Mickey Waller left the band shortly before they went in to Island Studios to record the follow-up album for Atlantic, Anvil Chorus, in January 1975, produced by Andy Johns.

At this point keyboard player Danny Peyronel left to join UFO and was replaced by John Sinclair. Shortly after, Cosmo was replaced by Barry Paul, and the band moved to Mickie Most's RAK Records where they recorded Kitsch, produced by Most.

Gary Holton sadly died of a morphine overdose in 1985 and the band remained on hiatus until 2002, with the returning line-up featuring founding members Thomas, Boyce with Peyronel and newcomers Marco Barusso and Marco Guarnerio (guitars and vocals).

On 8th August 2010 Danny Peyronel left the band and shortly after this actor John Altman (Eastenders' Nick Cotton) was unveiled as the new lead singer.  Altman was a good friend of original frontman Gary Holton and he appeared with him the film 'Quadrophenia' and has been cited by many as the perfect replacement for Holton.  With the returning Cosmo and Justin McConville (guitar/vocals/keyboards) augmenting the line-up, the band embarked on a tour commemorating the 25th anniversary of Holton's death. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Heavy+Metal+Kids">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
