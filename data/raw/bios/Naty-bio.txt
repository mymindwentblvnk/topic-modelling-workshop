Didn't release an album until 2006, but formed in 1988 as a death/thrash band. In the late 90's they transformed into a more alternative rock band, but with their recent reunification they've returned to their death/thrash sound with alternative influence.

The legendary rock band, NATY had been in the period of Korean heavy-metal renaissance. Its origin was based on thrash-metal and consisted of 6 members in 1986. NATY had started its first playing in 1988, and re-grouped itself as 4 members. After 1991, members of NATY did their musical jobs separately. Then, they came back to their enthusiastic fans with a new vocal, Sang-su Kim in 2004. NATY has been admired by many Korean bands and is still remembered for its intense style. In the time of Korean heavy metal golden age, its authenticity was heavily secured, however, nowadays; various genres have been mixed such as Hardcore, Funk, and Thrash. NATY doesn’t stick to a specific genre or a crossover but pursue its individual personality of its members. That’s where the unique musical tone of NATY comes from. The first album, which is ‘Long Time No See’, was received a favorable review by TERESA BUSTILLO THE MASTERING LAB, where takes in charge of mastering for its outstanding sound quality. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Naty">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
