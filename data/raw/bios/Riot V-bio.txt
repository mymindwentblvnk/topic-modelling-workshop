Following the death of Mark Reale (Riot founder, guitarist and main songwriter) in 2012, the New York City heavy metal band Riot decided to continue with making music, however, under another name. The band's name was changed to Riot V. 
Their first album with new material Unleash the Fire was released in Japan in August 2014 (still under the name Riot) and in Europe and the US in late October 2014 (as Riot V - Unleash the Fire).  
On April 27th 2018 the new album Armor of Light was released worldwide.
