Eintritt is an epic funeral doom metal project of Eija Risen, the sole member. Inspired by The Howling Void’s works, it was founded in April 2013 with the intention to take the genre’s epicness to a new level. Shortly after, six tracks were composed, awaiting guitar and vocal recordings. The debut album, Tempel der Meere, is a conceptual work and was released in August 2014. Its lyrics are odes to elements in nature, written in German, told from the perspective of a sailor on a journey at sea, metaphors for life and philosophy, and inspired by Andrey Tarkovsky’s movie “Stalker”.

Breath of Thanatos EP is a deeper take on the concept of Spirit of Fire. It depicts philosophical approach to dealing with suffering and hard times. Together with full-length and Myriad single, they form Eintrtitt compilation of the entire project.
