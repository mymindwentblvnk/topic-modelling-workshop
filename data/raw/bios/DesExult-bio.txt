Death/thrash band from Denmark formed in 1986. Recorded 6 demos.

Initially known as Samhain (Dnk). They appeared in two New Renaissance Records compilations on 1986: Speed Metal Hell 2, still as Samhain, with the song ``Plaque of Messiah``; and Thrash Metal Attack, already as Desexult, with ``Salvation``.

Desexult members used to have a zine around 1985/86 called Blackthorn, which inspired the name Darkthrone. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Desexult">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
