Cyne (Cultivating Your New Experience) formed in the summer of 2001, in the swamps of Gainesville, Florida. Cyne is emcees Akin Yai and Cise Star, and producers Speck and Enoch.

Their often politically-charged, culturally-introspective, and motivational lyrics find influence rooted in the early works of Nas, Public Enemy, Outkast and Common Sense. The production could be described as warm, soulful and organic -- born out of the school of producers that cite the likes of RZA, Pete Rock, Jay Dee, and DJ Premier. Cyne's "sound" is impacted by everything from Bad Brains to Krautrock, from Camp Lo to Kate Bush â€“ it's a hybrid of emotional, historical, and challenging influences.

The group's debut release was a 12" entitled "African Elephants," released in 2001. Cyne has since released a number of EPs, singles, and two critically well-received albums. They have also collaborated on projects with internationally acclaimed artists Daedelus, Four Tet and Nujabes. 

With previously released albums on Botanica Del Jibaro, P-Vine and City Centre Offices, Cyne has created a reputation as artists that stay true to the lyrical power and gritty cut-and-paste aesthetic of classic hip hop while managing to explore new sonic territory. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cyne">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
