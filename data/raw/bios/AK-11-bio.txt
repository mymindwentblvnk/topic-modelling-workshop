Ak-11 ( Avtomat – Kalashnikov : 11) is a one man project from Melbourne, Australia formed in April 2011 by Valak F. It’s inspired by Russia’s brutal war history, Siberia’s bleak & endless frozen wastelands, ancient Slavic heathens, Tundra wolves & vodka.
Recording some of the songs in the Russian language & embracing the spirit of Black Metal, Ak-11 explores the carnage & destruction of great battles past & present, European pagan mythology, existentialism & man’s dark & violent nature.
If you’re into ‘blackened’ metal then Ak-11 is for you. First official release is coming soon.
