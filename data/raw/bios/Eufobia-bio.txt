The name Eufobia comes from Greek and literally means "fear of good". Psychologists have chosen this name to mark the fear of good news.The band's logo (Angel's cross) symbolizes the harmony between human soul and body.

Founded in 2003 in Sofia, Bulgaria, Eufobia now consists of Niki (guitars and vocals), Steff (bass and vocals), Ivan (guitars) and Blago (drums and vocals). Their style of melodic death metal combines rock 'n roll song structures with odd time signatures and haunting melodies.Some of the lyrics have strong sexual content. 

Their first official album is called Insemination (2010), followed up by Cup Of Mud (2011), which includes re-recorded versions of the songs from their demo with the same title. Several videos were shot, some of them quite scandalous. Eufobia have toured Europe with bands like Onslaught, Suicidal Angels, and most recently, Gorgoroth and Vader. They also shared the stage with Dark Tranquillity, Malevolent Creation and many more.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Eufobia">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
