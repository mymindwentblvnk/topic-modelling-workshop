Kiina are an energetic group with an edge, hailing from Brighton, Finland, Devon and London.

Katarina Holmberg (lead vocals), a Swedish-Finn Brighton girl, and Steve Down the Devonian (guitar and backing vocals), met while studying music at Southampton University, both gaining firsts. They have been a musical team ever since. 

Kiina’s radio-friendly songs have recently been aired on BBC Southern Counties, Juice FM, Radio Reverb, and regularly feature on ABC radio in the USA, receiving reviews such as: 
“I love Kiina, she has a wonderful voice…you can hear there’s so much talent within that band… watch out with Kiina!” - DJ Sid Olivera, Producer of Fame Games, ABC Radio Networks.

This year Kiina have been scouted by Brighton’s number one live music venue, Concorde 2, by Rock Brighton and Seven Management (Dido) to play support slots for Neneh Cherry, Incognito, Finley Quaye and Two Spot Gobi. 

As well as playing the great music venues of Brighton, with more dates later this year at the Ramshackle, Brighton Coalition and the Bedford, Kiina are playing in London in venues such as the Soho Revue Bar, The 12 bar and ULU. See their myspace for up to date listings.

Kiina are a 6-piece band: Joe Erber plays fusion jazz/pop/soul keys, Chris Britt and Matt Weston provide the creative rhythm section for Kiina’s songs, and Francesca Young and Steve Down provide colourful soulful harmonies. Together the band create a unique chemistry that is obvious to the audiences at their live shows.

The band have spent the last year gigging, writing new songs and recording. Their four track EP is now available to buy by following the link on their myspace.
