Haemic is a musical project currently based in Taiwan.

Biography
The origins of Haemic can be traced back to when hungarian Adam Farkas composed, recorded and released some of his songs on his youtube account. This got the attention of Taiwanese guitarist Ray Heberer who got in contact with Farkas and thus they began recording music together. They have since added american Mitchell Shinderman to the fold who does the vocals.
