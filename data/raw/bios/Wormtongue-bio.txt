Wormtongue was conceived in 2004 by sole member Nate Adams with what began as a collection of dark acoustic folk songs. The project was later given the moniker Wormtongue, and the album was named "Solitude." After a two year break Wormtongue was brought back to life as a one-man symphonic black metal band. The first EP, "Memorial to a Golden Age," was released in early 2007. It features a collection of black metal songs with a distinct symphonic sound while still retaining the folk influence of the first album. A new demo is being completed and will be released in the coming months.
