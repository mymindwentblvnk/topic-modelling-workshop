Bruno Morais is a musician from Londrina – Parana (south/Brazil). This singer, composer and music producer initially became involved with music in 99 with a band called “Madame Brechot”, playing jazz, funk and samba classics. In 2003, he started thinking about his first album. The process ended in 2005 and the results are on the album “Volume Zero”, which got amazing reviews of the most important cultural medias in Brazil. His track “Para entrar” was chosen to be launched on Chill Pill compilation – Groove Gravy Records. In 2005, Bruno was selected to participate in the Red Bull Music Academy in Seattle, where he recorded new songs with the legendary producer Leon Ware (Marvin Gaye, Quince Jones, Ike and Tina and others), Vitamin D (Dela Soul, Blackalicious, Gift of Gab, etc), Toby Lang (Fat Freddy' s Drop) and XXXChange (promising producer of new York). Still in Seattle, he performed at the Sea Sound Lounge´pub with a very selected audience, which included people such as Biz Markie, Dj Harvey, Larry Heard, Arabian Prince and Morgain Geist. Right after the academy, he spent two months in Chicago, where he played with local amazing musicians at underground pubs, such as Morseland and Ice Factory. During his stay in Chicago, Bruno established a good connection with many local musicians, blending bits and mixing different cultures. While Bruno was getting ready to return to US, in September 2007, he had been very busy gigging with his band in Brazil, where his “Volume Zero” album was sold out . He was also working on a new album that would be released on October 2007.

In 2009, Bruno Morais released "A Vontade de Superstar", through ybmusic. He's been performing concerts and participating in other Sao Paulo's artists concerts since then.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bruno+Morais">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
