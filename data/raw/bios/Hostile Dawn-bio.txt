London based METAL band, no "core" added, no strings, no ribbons no bullshit!  Started off as a 5piece thrash/metal band in Oct 2008. After gigging solidly for a year and a bit, they started getting known in and around the London area. 
Unfortunately for them, over the last year several members left, leaving James Woodman the only original member.
After re-grouping, and taking a change of direction, towards the slower heavier, stompy sound they are soon to be releasing their follow up EP to "BOOZE N BLOOD" called "PRESSURE THE WOUND"
The current line up is:
Carl "headtrip" Higgins : Vocals
Harry Watson ; Rhythm guitar/ Backing Vocals
Steve Barlow : Lead/rhythm Guitar
Paul Bryden : Bass/ Backing Vocals
James Woodman : Drums
