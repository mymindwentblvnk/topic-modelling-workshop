The project was formed back in SYNKLETOS 1995 - he founded two other student-Demiurgos and Kaermis. As the musical foundation of the concept was selected "bright thought". However, the project lived extremely slowly, occasionally leaving a total inactivity.
In 1999 began recording a demo of the 8 tracks, entitled "Spiritual Alchemy" - the fall of 2002, it was ready. Since the recording was carried out at home with was available at that time more than the modest equipment, the sound quality of the resulting material was, by today's standards, it is not important. In 2007 it was decided to rewrite the "Spiritual Alchemy" with sound. By the time the group was already familiar with Igor 'KIV' Korolev, who later took up mixing the album. By the spring of 2011 the album was completely rethought, rewritten and reduced. In August 2011 the album was released on CD.

In December 2011 SYNKLETOS were noted on the album Butterfly Temple "Solstice. Best for 15 years," a cover of the song "Dreams of the North Sea."

Currently, the group began work on their second full-length album.
