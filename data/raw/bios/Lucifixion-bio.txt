Lucifixion was spawned in 1990 as a young act with influences rooted deeply in the underground and death metal acts of the time. With the release of a 6-song demo entitled “Born Into Death.” Lucifixion began performing at local venues. Some of the most memorable shows included opening for such national acts as Gutted, Sinister, Cynic, and Cannibal Corpse. Keeping with their momentum, Lucifixion entered the studio in 1996 and released their first full-length album “Indulge In The Macabre.” After a year of heavy promotion, the band was forced to regroup after the parting of key members. Over a number of years and further line-up changes, Lucifixion is back on the scene with the release of the studio EP “As Evil As Me.” The CD includes three tracks due to appear on their upcoming full-length album. The purpose of the EP is to give new listeners a taste of Lucifixion and long time fans a glimpse of the band’s evolution since “Indulge In The Macabre". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lucifixion">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
