FEVER 333 is an American rapcore band formed in Inglewood, California in 2017. The three-piece band consists of ex-Letlive vocalist Jason Aalon Butler, ex-The Chariot guitarist Stephen Harrison and Night Verses drummer Aric Improta. "333" represents the band's three principles: community, charity and change.

Their musical style merges elements of rock/metal and hip-hop, which the band describes as being "rooted in subversion", citing musical influences such as Rage Against the Machine, Public Enemy, and Black Flag. The lyrics address socially conscious themes and espouse a radical left-wing political view. FEVER 333 is signed to Roadrunner Records.
