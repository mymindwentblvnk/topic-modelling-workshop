In ancient times, a person who dreamed of flying was considered to have entered the realm of the immortal gods. The Native Americans, the Babylonians, the Hindus, the Tibetan Buddhists and many other traditions claim that we all have a light body that can leave the physical body during sleep. The light body can travel great distances and even into other dimensions that mystics call the astral planes. Here we can talk to our friends who also travel the dimensions, communicate with the people of the spirit world, or learn from the advanced souls the men once called gods and angels. Many scientists belive that there is empirical proof that out of body travel is possible. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ancient+Dreams">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
