There are multiple artists using this name:

1. Hexx displayed a number of different styles throughout their eight or so years in existence. Their debut, 1984's No Escape, was a guitar-driven straightforward metal album, with a touch of NWOBHM rawness. By 1986 a bit of thrash was introduced, an influence that became more noticeable as the band developed. Finally, by 1991, they had pretty much converted into a death metal band, though still with some thrash tendencies.
