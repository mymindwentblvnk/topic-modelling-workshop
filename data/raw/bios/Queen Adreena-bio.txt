Queen Adreena is a band from London, England that formed in 1999. Described at various times as “art, punk, gothic, metal, rock, or alternative”, Queen Adreena's music is difficult to categorize.

Formed by singer Katie Jane Garside and guitarist Crispin Gray, they had previously collaborated in the celebrated but short-lived band Daisy Chainsaw. Garside and Gray did not cross paths again until 1999 when they formed Queen Adreena. An album, Taxidermy, soon followed in 2000. Pete Howard, the last drummer to play with The Clash, joined just before the band signed with Rough Trade for their second album, 2002’s Drink Me, featuring the lead single "Pretty Like Drugs." Queen Adreena toured extensively in the UK and Europe. Their third album was released in 2005: The Butcher and the Butterfly.

Ride a Cock Horse, an album of mostly unreleased material from the Taxidermy era, was only available from MySpace www.myspace.com/queenadreenafrance in 2007.
In 2008, Queen Adreena released their final album Djin in Japan with a UK release the following year. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Queen+Adreena">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
