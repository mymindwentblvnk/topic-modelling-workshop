Two bands with this name, somehow:

1. Mutant Supremacy are death obsessed scumbags from Brooklyn. The band released their first full length, "Infinite Suffering" in 2010, a second full length, "Reincarnate" in 2014, and some splits and an EP in between. Mutant Supremacy plays Death Metal the old way: raw, hateful, and uncompromising. 



2. "Mutant Supremacy is a fast-food nitro black grind metal ranchero roots funcore combo from Mars. They released their first Earth demo in 2002 and have since released 3 others and one LP which had an extremely limited pressing on Mars, only a few copies survived entry into Earth's atmosphere which has resulted in extremely high bids on popular auction site eBay.com." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mutant+Supremacy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
