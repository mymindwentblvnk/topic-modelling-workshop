Honestly, there isn't a lot of information about this band, well, anywhere.. but they are from Japan, featuring one member from female Japanese crusty/black metal band Gallhammer. Congenital Hell is a sludge/doom metal band with a saxophone, kind of like if John Zorn were to get drunk with a faster version of Moss. Their discography includes:

- live album CD-R 2005 sold out (7 live songs in 2004. Ltd.66 copies.)
- 1st full length studio album "Anger and Grief" CD 2006 out in Apr.2006 (3 songs in 66 min. 6 sec.)
- 4 way split CD with Candid (Japan), Realm (Japan), and Intraum (Japan) out in 2006 (1 new studio song.)
- 3 way split CD with Serrando Codos (Spain) and Patisserie (Japan) out in 2006 (2 live songs in 2005.)
