1. Dutch Black Metal band:
Walpurgisnacht is a now defunct Melodic Black Metal band from Brabant, The Netherlands. They play a raw old style black metal, but combine this with a melancholic and epic touch, which is expressed in the melodic style of guitar riffing. Inspiration for both music and lyrics is mainly drawn from some obscure Dutch legends and the (original) grim and gloomy quality of "De Peel" - a once huge and impenetrable area of marshes, moors, fens and woods in the south of the Netherlands. 

Their first full-length album "Die Derwaert Gaen En Keeren Niet" was proudly released at the very end of 2005 by German label Folter Records. Second full-length "Vergheldinghens Crachte" was released in January 2014 by the Dutch label Aratron Records.
