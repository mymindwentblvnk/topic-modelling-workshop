King Pest's myspace 

King Pest was born in early 2008 of Wehrwolf and Dusks spoiled minds' will to create black, antisocial art filled with hatred and blasphemy. It didn't take long to find comrade who shared that will, Chaos. After a few months of torturing instruments with infernal sounds and putting their blasphemies together in practice space, it was time to record the filth for future generations. It effected in the hordes first opus, “Abomination Divine”. Also than it began to release its hatred on stage. With the beginning of year 2009, Skoll, for whom crushing delicate ears with violent and destructive noise is pure pleasure, joined the project. The future remains unclear but King Pest grows hailing evil, death and decay
