Asema formed in August of 2006 when Joe and Brit formerly of the band Tredd, and Zack formerly of Cadaver corps got together after both Tredd and Cadaver corps went their separate ways. The three of them got off to a great start writing songs and playing shows with out a bassist. After playing there 3rd show at Triumph Tattoos, the band met Danyel, a bassist. She ended up becoming Asema's fourth member in November of 2006. It seemed like the perfect fit the four members were very close and enjoyed the music they were making. They later played a show in Oak Harbor, Washington where the band met Kyle and informed him that they were looking for a 2nd guitarist. Kyle came and tried out and was then added to the band as Asema's 5th member.

After a few months of having a five piece band Danyel decided to part ways with Asema in September of 07. A close friend and fan to the band,Kenny, who is also a bassist informed Asema that he would love to tryout. The band has remained Brit on vocal, Joe on drums, Zack lead guitar, Kyle rhythm guitar, and Kenny on bass since then.

Asema is currently writing new songs and trying to prepare for a tour planning to happen in late summer of 2008. Asema also hopes to have a new record out this winter. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Asema">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
