Lester, Nowhere was born in '98. Originally named Arturo, he grew up listening to Black Sabbath while playing with Lego, Kurt Cobain while learning to draw, and Mogwai all along.

At the age of 12 he fell in love with hip hop, and never looked back. He's still in the process of trying to explain to his parents that music moved on even after the 90's.

Used to: be a student, play basketball, read Calvin & Hobbes. He quit everything to be a beatmaker, because he found everything he needed in that.

His body is currently living in Prato, but his mind is hustling to find a solution to this problem, hoping that his music will be heard in more places than he will ever go. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lester+Nowhere">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
