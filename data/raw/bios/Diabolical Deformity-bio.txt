Diabolical Deformity was born in 2004, with Carlos in guitars, Lalo in the bass and Fernando in the drum kit, after months of unsuccessful search for a vocalist, Carlos decides to take this paper too

Few weeks later, To√±o arrives as a guitar player, but he left the band due to musical difficulties.

Diabolical Deformity is gore inspired metal, but in a more artistic and poetic way

Having as principal influence the 80's thrash and death metal,the sound was a mix between 80's metal and new stuff
(Ex.-Church's Possession,15 Seconds,Euthanasia)
It was in the year 2007 when it becomes a Technical Brutal Death band
(Ex.-Rotten Love,Empty Canvas,The Skull Gates)

In the year 2006 LOY gets into the band (guitar), guitarist and vocalist from Warmind,in the year 2007, Fernando Molina becomes Deadblood drummer,and Lalo and Loy go back to Warmind

Carlos as the only member in the band, records the band's demo as a solo musician, and gives that technical focus composing 3 new songs (Empty Canvas,Rotten Love,The Skull Gate)

Diabolical Deformity will be back on stages, with more hate and blasphemy than ever. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Diabolical+Deformity">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
