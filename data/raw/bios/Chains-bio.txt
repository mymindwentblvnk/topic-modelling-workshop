(2)San Francisco’s Chains deliver their own unique blend of hardcore-influenced metal with a polished finish. Vocalist Matt Wilson (Set Your Goals): "I am equal parts darkness and light, and I have always had ideas that wouldn’t quite work for Set Your Goals; either the lyrics were too dark or the parts were too aggressive. Chains is an outlet for that. Once Set Your Goals slowed down I was able to put my ideas into motion. I grew up listening to extreme music, and this project is more in line with those tastes.”

[3.] Chains is Bulgarian metal band from Blagoevgrad / Dobrinishte. The group is created in 2008 by four friends who decided to express themselves in music. Chains started to explore the thrash metal genre and quickly became important act for the extreme scene in Bulgaria because of their live shows full of energy and dedication. Sharing the stage with artists like Kuln, Maze, Killmate, JND, Unseen Consequences, Six, Cut Off and many others brought nothing but respect for Chains. In the meantime, the band recorded 3 demo songs in studio in their native town. The group is often playing live around Bulgaria so stay tuned!
