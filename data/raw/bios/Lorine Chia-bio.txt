"Maybe one day i can make my own albums, travel the world and just do what i love doing. I thank God everyday for blessing me with a talent which i will use to reach out to people. I do this because it is indeed what makes me happy. Hopefully people will appreciate my style of music. Don't really have a preffered genre but mostly its like Alternative haha. They say the sky is the limit but i am way out of this galaxy." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lorine+Chia">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
