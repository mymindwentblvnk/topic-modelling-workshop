Blasphemy Rites was formed in 1997 by Ciosek (g./voc.), Menes (dr.), Brzozak (voc.) and Juszek (bass). From the begining they have totally underground fuck-off attitude - no website, no myspace profile.

In the begining they recorded their debut demo with 20 minutes of obscure barbaric stuff including cover of one of their main influences - Sarcofago's "Christ Death". Other main influences are Blasphemy, Impaled Nazarene, Sarcofago, Darkthrone, Sabbat, Venom…

In 2004 Maleficium Records released CD „Something Wicked, Raw & Ugly” which consisted demo and live recordings. The same year Ciosek tragically dies in motorcycle accident, later replaced by Mscislaw.

2005 sees another demo tape „Drink The Poisoned Piss of Baphomet" featuring 9 new tracks plus covers of Blasphemy and Celtic Frost.

In 2009 Blasphemy Rites enter the studio to record their debut full-lenght album - „Hideous Lord”. The album brings pure underground necrofury with 15 tracks of black/death metal with that chaotic, necrotic, ultra raw, barbaric groove well-known from the recordings of Blasphemy, Hellhammer, Archgoat, etc. Be destroyed. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Blasphemy+Rites">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
