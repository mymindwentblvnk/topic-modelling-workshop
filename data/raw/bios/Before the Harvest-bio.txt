Bursting into the local Townsville (Queensland) scene in mid 2011, were the fast paced, technical deathcore band, Before the Harvest. Wowing crowds with brutal riffs, mind-numbing blast beats, samples to kill for and vocals that'd make Jesus weep, they immediately cemented themselves as a force to be reckoned with. 

Having influences such as We Are The End, Thy Art Is Murder, The Red Shore, Signal The Firing Squad, Whitechapel, The Black Dahlia Murder, Make Them Suffer and Boris The Blade, Harvest have embraced the brutality of these, yet made their sound very much their own. Samples and writing in 9/8 timing helps keep everything progressing, and evolving, without being classed as 'just another deathcore band'.

Since their inception, they've supported bands such as: Signal the Firing Squad (twice), Courting Pandora, Tomb of Doom, as well as playing monthly music gigs, helping spread the brutality and supporting the music scene in their home town.

The people behind this beautiful assult on your ears?
