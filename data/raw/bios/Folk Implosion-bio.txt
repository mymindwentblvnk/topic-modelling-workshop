The Folk Implosion was an American indie rock/lo-fi band founded in the early 1990s by Lou Barlow and John Davis. It was initially a side-project started by Barlow to explore different territory than that being canvassed with his primary band at the time, Sebadoh. The name is a play on the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion.

The band's status was relatively obscure prior to the Larry Clark film Kids, and its soundtrack, most of which contained original compositions by Barlow and Davis. The song "Natural One" from this soundtrack was a hit single, peaking at #26 on the Billboard Hot 100, #4 on the Billboard Modern Rock Charts and #20 on the Mainstream Rock Charts.[1] Though the band attempted to duplicate the success of that song, their subsequent albums and singles were nowhere near as successful as the "Natural One" single. After Davis left the band in 2000, Barlow recruited Russ Pollard and Imaad Wasif from the band Alaska! to record The New Folk Implosion. In 2002, the band appeared as the backing musicians for the main character played by Alessandro Nivola in the film Laurel Canyon. The band has not been active since 2004.
