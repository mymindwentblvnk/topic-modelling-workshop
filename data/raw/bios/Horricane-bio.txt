HORRICANE was formed in 2002 by well-known and recognized members of Estonian metal scene. With a confident line-up HORRICANE quickly found its own style. Horricane's style represents the most massive guitar riffing of its own genre and the music is mixed with threatening and horrifying keyboard melodies in order to create unique and unforgettable atmospheres.

In early spring of 2004, after several and successful one-off shows with prominent headliners like Behemoth (Pol) and Vader (Pol) and small-scale touring in home country, the band entered a studio to record the first demo. Zorg Studio was chosen to get the best out of HORRICANE and present the most furious and exclusive HORRICANE trade mark sound, which has got good response at all venues the band has performed at and has gathered a notably loyal fan base in home country as well as neighbouring Baltic states. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Horricane">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
