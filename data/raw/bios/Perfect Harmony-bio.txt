The members of Perfect Harmony were born and raised in Chicago. These identical twins began performing and writing music at a very early age. They attended both high school and college in the state of California. Recently, they have toured around the country and have shared the stage with numerous legends (ie. Ali Woodson of the Temptations and the Gap Band). Their sultry sound and style brings it like Teedra Moses's "Complex Simplicity" and tells it like Keyshia Cole's "The Way It Is". Stay on the look out for these rising stars; and their debut album, "Put In Work!". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Perfect+Harmony">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
