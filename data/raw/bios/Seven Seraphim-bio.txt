Seven Seraphim are a Power Metal Band from the United States. Amusingly, a lot of their songs' scales go up (intead of the usual down) and leads to a unique sound. They use a lot of orchestral intruments in their unusual brand of music. Essentially it has a mix of progressive and neoclassical influences, combined with 'Heavy' Metal. Although unique, the lead vocalist has a similar voice to Tobias Sammet of DragonForce.

Seven Seraphim has announced their perfoming line up with the talents of Andrew Szucs on guitar, Sam Terceman on vocals, David Howard on drums and Alessandro Cornia on bass.
