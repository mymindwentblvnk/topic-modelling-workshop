Current band members are Darko Kurjak (drums) from Partibrejkers, Miloš Kralj (bass), Dragana Mijatović – Gaga Lee(vocals) and Pavle Kirćanski (guitars). The quartet plays alternative rock with sincerity and energy of a garage band, fanatically committed to total authenticity of expression. Their sound image is a sublimation of classic rock and protopunk, and at the same time repercussion of vibe from the most inspiring eras of the music scenes in Detroit, Seattle and Los Angeles, moled into uncopromising and straigh-up 21. century rock. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hype">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
