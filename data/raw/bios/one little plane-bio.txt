A twist on the singer-songwriter tradition, One Little Plane is a musical epiphany straight from the unfaltering beat of one little heart -- the captivating Kathryn Bint. You may have first heard the beguiling voice of One Little Plane on the Four Tet remix of 'Melody Day,' the single from Caribou's latest album Andorra (2007). Originally from Chicago, Kathryn relocated to London in 2003, where she began recording in her flat with producer Kieran Hebden (Four Tet) in 2005. Together, they created One Little Plane's distinctive soundscape of unique instrumentation: a combination of electric and acoustic guitars, small percussion, thumb piano, melodica, keyboards, vibraphone, samples and multi-tracked vocals. From the acoustic wanderings of title track 'Until' and 'Make of Me,' to the heavy drums and multi-tracked vocals of 'Lotus Flower' and 'Nobody Out There,' to the playful pop beat of 'Sunshine Kid,' like a book of short stories, each of Kathryn's songs are a lyrical journey into a secret garden of everyday wonders and melodies. One Little Plane is a new signing to Text Records, the label run by Kieran Hebden (Four Tet) that released acclaimed albums Happiness and The Sun by Fridge. The album was produced by Kieran Hebden who has in the past produced Foals, James Yorkston and Beth Orton, done remixes for artists such as Radiohead, Bloc Party and Battles, and released a number of successful albums as Four Tet. One Little Plane's music will appeal to fans of Cat Power, Bat for Lashes, Beth Orton, and Feist.
