Based in Moscow and only 18 years of age Dmitry Evgrafov has already been composing for four years, but has only recently sculpted a sound which feels suitably his own. His debut 5 track EP Lying On You Shoulder, recorded whilst studying Sound Design in Moscow, blends intimate piano parts with delicately evocative string arrangements and brings to mind the work of contemporary artists such as David Wenngren or Nils Frahm whilst still retaining roots in minimalism owing a debt to the likes of Arvo PÃ¤rt or La Monte Young and classical stalwarts like Ludivico Eniaudi and Michael Nyman. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dmitry+Evgrafov">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
