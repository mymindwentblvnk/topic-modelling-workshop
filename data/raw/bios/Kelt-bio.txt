Adopting the philosophy that life is not a race, Australian singer/songwriter, kelt, has taken his time delivering this impressive debut album. With early recording taking place in an old shack on the outer suburbs of Brisbane and final sessions occurring in Melbourneâ€™s Eastern Bloc Studios, this album has benefited greatly from both the variety of recording environments and the many talented people involved in its production.
