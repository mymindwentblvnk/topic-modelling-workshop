Isilma is a Symphonic Metal band from Vestfold, Norway. They have played together for about four years now, and they have changed a lot since the first jam-session, autumn 2004. 
They have played on several local concerts and they have been known for experimenting with different genres to create their own sound. Some like it, some don’t. 
Their newest material, like the songs on this page, are not as mixed as their previous songs and it seems like they’re going to keep this sound. 
If you like symphonic music mixed with hard guitars and screaming, then you have nothing to lose, check out Isilma! 
Winter 2006 they recorded an album which they chose to call “Silent Dreamers”. After a lot of listening, Isilma found out that this wasn’t good enough, but they still decided to sell it as a promotional CD. 

Line-up:
Karoline Klevan: Keyboard
Eirik Hansen: Guitar
Per Kamfjord: Drums
