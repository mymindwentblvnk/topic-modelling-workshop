Formed in 1971 in Poole, Dorset by brothers Gary (guitar and vocals) and Tristan Margetts (bass, synth and vocals) and drummer Tony Brock, the band, originally called Transient Sand, signed to Harvest Records and released a Greg Lake-produced eponymous album in 1972. This album, and its follow up "Triad" (released that same year), won criticial acclaim but little success and the band split in early 1973. Brock featured in Strider and The Babys before joining Rod Stewart's band whilst Tristan Margetts joined Lake's band. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Spontaneous+Combustion">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
