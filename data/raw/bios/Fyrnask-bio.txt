The project wants to create a mixture that is not too common. Strong influences of Ambient, Doom and Ritual Music are blended with a rather classic Black Metal sound. Fyrnask formed in 2008 in Germany as a solo project. Over the next years, a live line-up was gradually assembled and 2014 saw Fyrnask's first appearances on stage as a full band. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fyrnask">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
