Vaginal Bear Trap (also know as VBT) is a death metal infused grindcore band from San Antonio, Texas. In 2010, VBT recorded their first full length, Slow Jams, and released it for free through their myspace and facebook pages. Although they encompass the D-beat and power violence aspects of grindcore, they are most notably a brutal band. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vaginal+Bear+Trap">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
