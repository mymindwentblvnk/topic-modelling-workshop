Sunuthar was founded in the beginning of 2007 in a small town near Berne (Switzerland). Various literary and musical influences inspired me to found a little side project. The name Sunuthar roots from the rune dictionary and means Sunday. Since I have worked on this project almost exclusively on Sundays, the name fits the bill. Plus, the word also has something old and mystical about it, which fits the music. The motivation for this project, apart from my post as a guitar player in the Helvetic Folk Metal band Excelsis, comes from bands like Bathory (R.I.P.) or Ayreon, but also from influences of Pagan Metal, which results in songs that do not really fit the style of Excelsis. At the moment I am working on a couple of songs which I will upload on myspace and the best ones will probably make it on an album. The release date for the album should be at the end of 2008, but that is not sure yet, since things can change quickly nowadays. Most lyrics are fantasy inspired, as well as legends and myths from ancient times. I will also try to incorporate several Swiss legends into this musical experience. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sunuthar">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
