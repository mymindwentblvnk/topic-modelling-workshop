There are two artists named Krunch: 

1) Krunch is a legendary hardcore punk band from Timr√•, Sweden. Krunch's approach to punk was breathtaking speed, neck-breaking turns, a very special humor, and surrealistic lyrics that made them one of the true pioneers of the second wave of punk that arrived to Sweden in early 80's influenced by bands like Discharge and MDC.

"Krunch is an all out, guns blasting panzer attack of a metal mutha played by inhuman hands. Second best single in the stack" -NME, UK.


2) Krunch is Ze'ev Diukman and Omer Kadosh (Rizo), a trance duo from Israel. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Krunch">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
