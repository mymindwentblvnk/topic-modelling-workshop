The Man-Eating Tree Is a Finnish five-piece band, performing atmospheric metal music. The seed of the new band was planted when Vesa Ranta, having taken a break from music after Sentenced, began to overcome his post-Sentenced battle against fatigue and lack of musical motivation. The idea of a new band – or bands – was eventually brainstormed over a period of time between Vesa and his friends, including gentlemen Miika Tenkula, Aaron Rantonen, Janne Markus and Mikko Uusimaa. Plans were made reality in 2009; the outfit was completed by the addition of Tuomas Tuominen (ex-Fall Of The Leafe) as a vocalist and Heidi Määttä (ex-Embraze) as a keyboard player. First demo recordings were made in the spring and summer of 2009. The bulk of compositions are the origin of Janne Markus (Poisonblack), with some contribution also from Aaron Rantonen. Much of the lyrical input is contributed by Tuomas Tuominen. 

Debut album "Vine" was released on 2010. After that Century Media records signed the band worldwide. Second album ''Harvest'' came out 2011. Both albums were produced by Hiili Hiilesmaa.

On 1st of January 2013 the band announced on their website that Tuomas Tuominen had quit the band due to musical and also non-musical reasons. No bigger drama was involved. 

On 7th of July 2013 the band announced that they had found a new singer, Antti Kumpulainen. Later they also announced that the band had parted ways with Heidi Määttä. For now the band will continue as a quintet.
