Cosmic Plunge were formed in May of 2010 in Heraklion, Crete, Greece. Sharing a common vision about what the Band would sound like they immediately started working on their own material, inspired by the last (3) three decades of Rock , specifically Doom/Heavy Rock sound and similar influences.

Their priority is performing live and sharing their music and feelings   and for this reason they begun playing live soon after the formation of the band mostly in their hometown but also in various gigs across the country. They have shared the stage with many acknowledged bands of both the Greek and international scene such as Nightstalker, Lucky Funeral, 1000mods , Universe 217, Vibravoid, Shattered Hope etc .

After gathering enough experience  they decided it was the right time to record their debute album in February 2014. The recordings took place in various locations. Drums were recorded at John Mor's, all guitars were recorded at Groove Studio, mixing and mastering was done by Dimitris Kakoulakis and Cosmic Plunge the artwork  was  created by Mick Alex and Cosmic Plunge.

The album titled ”Wanderers On The Face Of The Earth” was released in late November 2014 containing 7 songs. 

Cosmic Plunge’s second attempt "Dealing With The Harvester" will be released in 6/2/2019 and contains 6 songs.
