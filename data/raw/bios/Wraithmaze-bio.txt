Wraithmaze is an independent finnish horror-metal band founded at the end of 2009.

Main inspiration is to make music where horror movie atmosphere meets
scandinavic melancholy.

Wraithmaze's version of scaremonger-metal combines elements from
doom/rock/blackmetal/ambient-bastardization.

One obsession is also to have something to say, to produce some sort of eerie/outsider reflections of reality.

Wraithmaze's debut album Adagio in Self-Destruction was released in 2011. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wraithmaze">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
