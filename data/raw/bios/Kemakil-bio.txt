KEMAKIL was formed by Rob Durrant in 1988 and played a number of shows around Ipswich and Suffolk including a support slot with PAUL DIANNO'S BATTLEZONE and great shows with TARANIS and OBLITERATION.The band split up in 1990 but reformed in the form of Rob and Chris Stockdale in 2007.In the cold damp evenings of October that year,an album's worth of material was recorded at Rob's house and was issued as a demo called 'Gondolas On The Styx'. 2008 saw AARON BOAST(drums) and HADYN MORGANS(bass) join the band and after successful shows in Ipswich and London,the 'Blood Removal Machines' EP was recorded at Punch Studios in Ipswich(December 2009).This is due for release in 2010.The aim of the band has always been to go out and and make an enjoyable racket in the vein of bands like EXODUS,VIO-LENCE and OVERKILL with no interest in trends and commerciality.THE THRASH KEEPS A ROLLIN'!
