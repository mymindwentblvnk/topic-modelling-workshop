Kimya Dawson (born 17th November 1972) is an Olympia-based singer-songwriter, and a prominent part of the anti-folk movement.

Dawson became well known as a member of The Moldy Peaches. Since the Moldy Peaches took a break from performing and recording in 2004, Dawson has released a string of lo-fi homemade albums, and toured widely in North America and Europe.

In 2005 the Pharmacy and Matty Pop Chart performed as her backing band on a U.S. tour.  In 2006 she collaborated with a number of friends to make a group, Antsy Pants, that recorded and released an album on Plan It X Records.

Dawson's songs are featured in the films The Guatemalan Handshake and Glue, both of which were shown at the Olympia Film Festival in November 2007. There is also some of her music in the cult movie Juno, which is the fastest selling film soundtrack since Saturday Night Fever.

Kimya's "kid's album" Alphabutt was released in 2007, and recording for her new album "Thunder Thighs" is wrapping up as of Fall 2010.  The mean time she has spent writing and touring, as well as spending time with her family and singing with the Olympia Free Choir. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kimya+Dawson">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
