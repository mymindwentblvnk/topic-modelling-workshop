Burning Star Core is the brainchild of violinist / vocalist / electronic improviser C. Spencer Yeh of Cincinnati, Ohio. Occasionally, a small rotating cast of improvisers join him to play bigger events including Mike Shiflet, and Trevor Tremaine and Robert Beatty of Hair Police.
__________________________

C. (Chih-Fu) Spencer Yeh was born in Taipei, Taiwan 1975, moved to the US in 1980; studied radio / television / film at Northwestern University, and is now based out of Cincinnati, Ohio. Yeh is active both as a solo and ensemble artist, as well as with his primary 'organized sound' project, Burning Star Core.

As an improviser, Yeh has focused on developing a personal vocabulary using violin, voice, and electronics. As a sound organizer / composer, Yeh works with all aspects available surrounding a work, aurally and physically, as elements key to the cumulative experience. He is concerned not only with the sensual aspects of sound, but the gestural qualities as well.

Yeh has performed alongside and collaborated with a deep and ever-growing list of artists and groups including Tony Conrad, Evan Parker, Thurston Moore, The New Humans with Vito Acconci, Paul Flaherty and Chris Corsano, John Wiese, Aaron Dilloway, John Olson & the Graveyards, Amy Granat, Jutta Koether, LaDonna Smith, Carlos Giffoni, Okkyung Lee, Atsuhiro Ito, Lasse Marhaug, Audrey Chen, Nate Wooley, JP Feliciano, Rafael Toral, Rhys Chatham's Guitar Trio All-Stars, Damo Suzuki's Network, and many others, and has performed across the U.S.A. and Europe in a variety of settings and festivals.

Most recently he participated in the 24 Hour Drone People project in Stockholm (and the abbreviated 5 hour version in Amsterdam), alongside artists such as CM Von Hauswolff, Mika Vainio, Joachim Nordwall, BJ Nilsen, Hildur Gudnadottir, Hild Sofie Tafjord, and Mark Wastell.

He has also had visual art and video works presented internationally.
