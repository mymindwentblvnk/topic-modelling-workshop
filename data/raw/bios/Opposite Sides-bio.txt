Opposite Sides is an italian metal band formed by guitarist Massimo "Arke" in 2000.

Soon other musicians added to the project: Amon 418 (Hate Profile, ex-Baratro) as guitarist and Martyr (ex-Hortus Animae) as singer. In 2004 they recorded "The Eclipse of Existence" strongly reminiscent of a technical Death Metal with lyrics based on existential topics. 

After various line-up changing, Grom (ex-Ancient, ex-Hortus Animae) added as session drummer and in 2008 they release the debut album "Soul Mechanics". 

Their style gathers elements from death/trash metal, industrial/electronics and progressive music. The result is songs that are catchy as glue, technical, heavy and melodious. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Opposite+Sides">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
