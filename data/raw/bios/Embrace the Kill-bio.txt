Embrace the Kill started in June of 2007. Although the band has some history of a few shows, and one recording over the years before 2007, the line up that stands is who truly makes up Embrace the Kill for what it is. ETK is an experimental mix of crusty punk, thrash metal, reggae ska, aimed in the direction of the unknown. Embrace the Kill has played a number of shows with such bands as Subhumans, MDC, Leftover Crack, Poison Idea, Citizen Fish, Toe Tag, Toxic Narcotic, Witch Hunt, The Vibrators, I Object, Instant Asshole, Union 13, Agent Orange, Voo Doo Glowskulls, Mouth Sewn Shut, Fleas and Lice, Vitamin X, Nino Zombie, Morning Glory, Static Thought, Society's Parasites, etc. ETK's plans are to finish up our full length by the end of the year and release the record with Rodent Popsicle in early 2009 and then hit the road with MDC for a full USA tour. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Embrace+The+Kill">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
