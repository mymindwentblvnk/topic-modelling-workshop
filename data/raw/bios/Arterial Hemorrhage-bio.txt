  About Arterial Hemorrhage
Hi guys, we're Arterial Hemorrhage, and we probably won't be playing in your town anytime soon. Maybe one day, after playing a buttload of gigs here, and getting some merch + recordings out there, will we be awesome enough to embark upon some kind of tourgasm. 

Anyway, we are 4 pretty brutal dudes. 3 of us hailing from the mean streets of Rockingham. Yeah, that's right...Arterial Hemorrhage is composed mainly of southern Rocko scum. That's actually the reason why we don't play too many gigs...we're too busy busting skulls and stealing money for goon...ahhh...delicious goon. Got a problem with that? No worries. Trolley poles at dawn. 

Meh, enough about what we do in our spare time. As it happens, we've played with some pretty swell bands, including (but not neccesarily limited to) Empire (BATC), Left Ablaze, Dyscord, Menstruating Tuppy Hole, Binding The Flesh, Hitman, Angelsai, Claim The Throne, Red Descending, Nexus, Psychonaut, The Alchemont, Noctis, Chaos Divine, The Furor, Wardaemonic and Neverbjorn. We've also played some of the biggest venues in Perth, including Chris Brown's living room, and Hulk's big-ass shed.
Arterial Hemorrhage started as a one man joke  grind/death metal band from Australia. After releasing their first demo, "Grind or Die", Arterial Hemorrhage got a full line-up.
