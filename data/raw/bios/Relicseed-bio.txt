Since its foundation in 2004 in RÄ«ga, Latvia heavy metal band Relicseed has gained an authority in their native Latvian metal scene and risen from underground band to an upcoming international act. Extraordinary riffing and harmonies mixed with energetically fulfilled live performance creates Relicseed's signature since it was introduced to the audience as a four piece metal union.

The band has shared stage with such metal acts like Sabaton, Caliban, Evile, Korpiklaani, Krucipusk, Deadlock, and Crematory.

Members:

Edgars Rakovskis - guitars, vocals;
