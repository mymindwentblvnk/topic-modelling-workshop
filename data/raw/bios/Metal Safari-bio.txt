The Japanese Metalcore/Thrash Band METAL SAFARI was formed in March 2005 by INAMOTO, Hiro-yuki and YAZU to play metal all over the world. In that line-up they quickly recorded 3 consecutive demos which were distributed for free at their shows. JUN joined METAL SAFARI in July 2005 and the band became complete. In August Hiro-yuki was filmed for the DVD of Young Guitar's October 2005 issue. Also shooting of "Hell's Blast" promotional video took place.
In September METAL SAFARI played their debut show and also finished the recording of their first demo album "The First 7 songs". Their first full album titled "RETURN TO MY BLOOD" dropped on 21st May 2006. As an act of album promotion in 2006 they took part in KRANK supported Awaken Asian Attack tour and played at Taiwan's biggest music festival FORMOZ FEST. In 2007 they continued their "RETURN TO MY BLOOD" tour. Aside from constantly gigging domestically they did a headlining tour in several Asian countries (Taiwan, Hong Kong, China) and visited Europe for the first time by taking part in METALFILIA 2007 tour fest across Poland. In 2008 Metal Safari stays active in Japan and starts to work on it's 2nd album scheduled for Autumn.

In August 2011, Ba. JUN left the band for personal reasons and for feeling a change of responsibility toward the band. Auditions were held and he was replaced by Ba. Tomo in September. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/METAL+SAFARI">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
