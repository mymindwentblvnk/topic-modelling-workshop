Origin

Our demo studio “Muttala” is in Vantaa ( ca 20km/12,5 miles from Helsinki).  Our rehearsal studio is in Helsinki, Finland.


Hatestory

I started the band in January 2002 with the simple goal of creating a band without boundaries, without any musical limitations. A band, whose music would be aggressive, extreme, relentless and sometimes beautiful, and of course, when you want to do something different than what the normal Finnish metal scene has to offer.. it was really hard to find guys who want the same.

Jukka and Tuukka joined HATETREND in 2005 and brought a huge load of talent with them.

Janne joined HT in 2008 and he brought extreme precision and a truck load of riffs with him.

Riku joined HT in September 2010 bringing with him a monster sound.

As a demo band we had great success, getting really good reviews. But we never got that offer that we could not refuse. So instead of accepting a bad deal we decided to go and record by ourselves and with our own money.

We chose to use Astia studio and Anssi Kippo. Anssi Kippo had previously worked with Children of Bodom and Norther (as their producer).

It took us a while to get it done but we are really happy with the result.

Now as we launch the new version of our website hatetrend.com you can enjoy some of our new music via the Hateplayer. Or you can check out our page at myspace, www.myspace.com/hatetrend and listen to more songs there.

Thanx for all the support! See you at our gigs!
