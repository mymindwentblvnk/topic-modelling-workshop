There are three artists under "Big Mike":

1. Michael Barnett (born 1971, better known by his stage name Big Mike, is an American rapper from New Orleans, Louisiana. He was originally a member of Convicts with Houston rapper Mr. 3-2. Their album would be the first of many releases Mike would put out on Houston based Rap-A-Lot Records. 
He made his next major appearances with the Geto Boys on the 1993 album Till Death Do Us Part. He was brought on to replace Willie D, who had left the group. However, after a dispute with Scarface over how Mike's presence was interpreted by the fans, Big Mike was out and begun his solo career with the 1994 album Somethin' Serious. In 1997, his 2nd solo album Still Serious was released and made it onto the Billboard top 20. A video for the track "All a Dream" was released and had modest play on BET and MTV.

2. Big Mike was formed in New York circa 1995 By the singer/songwriter duo John Tucker and John Fanelli (vocals) along with their friend and bandmate Mike Morel on lead guitar.
They weren't really a formal band until they moved to San Diego and hooked up with a drummer and bass player (Seth Bennett and Gus Kendrick respectively) and started playing club and party gigs. Sometime shortly after hooking up with Seth and Gus, Tucker asked if the band could turn some of Edwin Decker's poems into songs. He happily said yes and soon became their manager/lyricist. After Edwin was on board, Mike Decker, his younger brother and guitarist, joined the band as well. The group spent many golden hours together, drinking beer and writing songs. They were together about 2 years and released one album called Heaven's To Betsy, named for John Fanelli's sister who financed it. (From Edwin Decker.)
