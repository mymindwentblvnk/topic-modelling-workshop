London-born, and from Côté d’Ivoire, the emerging artist is an Instagram item adored for her cutting-edge sense of style where she models nifty garms from baggy pullovers and oversized suits with eccentric ties, to cool cowboy boots. As a young, immigrant, and woman of colour with a clear-cut vision, Flowerovlove is dedicated to sustainability, having fun and uplifting women.

"I’m Flowerovlove! I am a 16-year-old musician and I also model. Flowerovlove means we are blossoming, growing and developing, like a flower does. ‘Flower’ also represents women and the power that we hold and bring into this amazing world. That is why I only work with women and have an all women team." - via Coeval Magazine <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/flowerovlove">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
