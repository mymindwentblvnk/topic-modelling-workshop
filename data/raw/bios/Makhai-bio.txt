This album was created by one individual (Thomas Kellogg) during the time of going to school at Full Sail University in Orlando, FL. Thomas is from, believe it or not, a small town of Valley City, North Dakota. The concept of the album is someone that has felt like they were trying to reach a goal or you could say dream but had to sacrifice a lot to achieve it. Everyone has been in a time of their life when they have felt like they are "Surviving In Solitude".
