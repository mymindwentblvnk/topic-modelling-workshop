(2003-2009)
AFTER RISING SUN was started out in early 2003 with quite an impressive cast of six people. Ivo and Jan were shouting together, Sebastian and Bj√∂rn were rocking the guitars while Marcel was raping the bass and Simon beating hell outta the drums. In that constellation we played our emo-kinda hardcore-punk style for about four shows until our present vocalist Steve replaced Ivo cause of some indifferences in terms of the style and our music. That happend in the summer of 2004 from where on it all sounded more and more metallic. The fact that we didn't wanna loose the melodic influences definetly pushed us a level further in terms of technique and ambitions.
Since those changings in the band happend we were also able to catch more and more experiences from other bands cause we also had a lot more concerts in the past. In spring of 2005 the first demo-cd was released and in September we could make a good deal with the fresh German label Village Kids Records. In the meantime singer Jan left the band due to personal reasons. We released a split cd with the Belgian band For The Day Of Redemption in March 2006 - our recordings were made at the Rape Of Harmonies Studio
