[4]  A group established, out of S.F., CA. In 1996 by Terrell (Switch) Irving and Adam (A.J) Jack, (cousins), as a way to make a legit business move for the family. The idea was submitted to close childhood friend (Mike Jabar) and he swiftly became an investor in the new found business. Although they had known each other from around the neighborhood, the group was fomally introduced right in the back of "Lee's". Lee's is the arab liquor store w/the chinese name on the corner of Revere/Jennings. "Lee's Corner". They started spittin lyrics and talkin shit while smokin and "Cloud Nine" (Sani "Sani-Moe" Tandy), (Paris "Pimp-A-Hoe" Brooks) and (Terrell "Switch" Irving) was born, a put together group! Now they had the group, they needed the label behind it, "strictly indie", so Pyramid Productions was created. Thinking ahead as well as being cheap, Switch decided not to invest into the label, instead he decided to focus his time, preparing the label and focusing on the upcoming Cloud Nine album. Initially the group was given 12 to 15 months to complete the album, but things happen and Switch was arrested and slapped w/a 12 month parole violation. After being released 12 months later, w/90 days left until the last rotation cycle and 1 unfinished song, it was time for some serious work. Being focused and staying determined, "Last Days Of A Hustler", was written, recorded, pressed and released in 90 days. After showing they had what it took Cloud Nine, began making noise and making moves. Labbin and performing w/major local artist, as well as artist out of state. Familied up w/11-5, U.D.I and Cold World, Cloud-9 became the last official members in the (K.A.H) Kill-A-Hoe tribe and represented well. As the name grew so did the fan base and the more moves were made until someone made the wrong one. With that move made Pyramid Productions was no more. Without a label and there $$$ fuck off in the drama ,Cloud Nine, turned to what they were, hustlin, alcholic and weedheads. The streets got em and time moved on, remember thes aren't gangster rappers, but gangsters that rap. All real, 4real, the streets make the stories, we only express them. So here we go again for u, Cloud Nine, welcome back to our Nine.
