AARDVARKS is a death/thrash metal band from Bonn (NRW), Germany and were founded in spring 1992 by the two brothers Guido and Andreas Meyer de Voltaire. On their long quest for musicians, which whom they would be able to realize their ideas and imaginations perfectly on stage and in studio, they met Nick Homfeldt in October 1995 on drums and finally in April 1996 Sven Krautkrämer on bass.

In Febuary 1998 Andreas left the band to concentrate on his studies, but first in Daniel Hauenstein and since December 2001 in Hiyu Utakai they found a replacement more than worthy.

Their compositions unite the influences of the Thrash, Heavy und Death Metal of the last decade in all its various styles. Power, aggression and melody are combined to a harmonic general concept, which fascinates a varied auditory. AARDVARKS create their atmospheric sound – as a counterpole to most acts of the current genre - without the use of any keyboards, just with the traditional intruments. Their songs exist of slow-melodic parts as well as pulsing mid-tempo riffings or sceaming-brutal thrash-parts.

AARDVARKS is:
- Guido Meyer de Voltaire | Rythm Guitar & Vocals
- Martin Below | Drums
- Kevin Olasz | Lead Guitar
- Sven »Sieben« Schmoll | Bass

There is one band called "AARDVARKS" and a few more called "The Aardvarks", several of whom have tracks listed against this listing for Aardvarks.

According to the Searchin’ For Shakes database there are four garage groups called the "The Aardvarks".

1) One of the three American groups that used the name were from Muskegon and released a few singles. Probably their most well-known number is the blazing garage-psych tune “I’m Higher Than I’m Down”, included on many comps (most notably Pebbles Vol 11). 

2) In the mid-1980’s, a London group called The Aardvarks got together. They’ve got two singles and one album to their name - the a-side of their first 7” was compiled on The Children of Nuggets box in 2005. Inspired by the best in 60s sounds (Mod, garage, pop-art, psychedelia, freakbeat), London’s The Aardvarks were formed in Ealing, as part of the same scene which eventually reared Kula Shaker. For many years, they were one of the most popular bands on the Mod and 60s Revival circuit, issuing a string of acclaimed 45s on labels such as Screaming Apple and Detour. The Aardvarks’ 12-year lifespan is remembered on the ‘Sinker, Line and Hook - The Anthology 1987-1999’ compilation on Cherry Red Records, built around their 1995 album for Delerium, Bargain, while also offering an equal number of choice tracks from elsewhere. The ‘Varks tasted brief fame in the 90s, appearing on the James Whale TV Show and even supporting Bonnie Tyler!  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Aardvarks">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
