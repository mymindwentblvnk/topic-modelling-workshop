Opal Island, the new album by London's Konntinent, would fit nicely on a Venn diagram with fellow drone artists Emeralds, Oneohtrix Point Never, and Black to Comm. The primary overlap point would be a knack for microscopic detail. Using an array of oscillators, arpeggiators, and crazy sounds you can't easily place they gather errant scraps of instrumentation and noise into uncanny wholes. But when we say "drone," don't think dark and dense-- this is lively, diverse music.
