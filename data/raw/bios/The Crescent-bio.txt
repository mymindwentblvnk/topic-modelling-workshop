There are multiple artists using this name.

1.  Finnish Black Metal. The musical and the magickal continuation of Enochian Crescent. 2012 Band signs a deal with Spinefarm Records and records 10 new songs for the new album. But this year means also the end of an era as vocalist Wrath leaves the band and the rest of the group continue under the name of The Crescent with Hellwind Tuonenjoki (ex-Sacrilegious Impalement / Desolate Shrine) as their new frontman.

2. The Crescent are an indie rock band formed in 1995 by Sean Longsworth (bass) and Joey Harrison (drums) from Huyton in Merseyside, England.

Longsworth and Harrison were still in their teens when they formed The Crescent. They were soon joined by Karl Rowlands (guitar). The band backed fellow Huytonian Lee Mavers, formerly of The La's, at gigs. However, Maver's famously erratic personality soon led to difficulties.

After Wayne Whitfield (vocals) joined the band they were signed by 'Hut'. Their debut single, 'On The Run' made the UK Top 50 in May 2002. Two further singles followed, each reaching the UK Top 70, before a self-titled album was released in September 2002.

Their track 'Spinnin' Wheels' was featured on the 2002 Virgin/EMI compilation 'The Album: Volume 4'. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Crescent">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
