2) Prowl began their musical journey in 2008, in North Yorkshire, after several individual failed attempts at finding a satisfactory outlet for creativity. Benjamin Sherwood found Loz Goodacre, via the magic of the internet - Loz found Jono Sayner a few years earlier via the same medium and decided to drag him along to meet Benjamin. 

They met, they played...the rest is, as they say, history...

The band went their separate ways in 2012. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Prowl">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
