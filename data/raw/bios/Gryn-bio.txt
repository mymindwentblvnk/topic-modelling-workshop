GRYN, also known as, (Generation Raise Your Nation) Was fathered in the small college town of Hays, KS by the talents of Brett Straight (Front man) Ben Bunker (guitar/vocals), Jason Walters (Guitar), Shawn Normandin (bass) Jacy McCann (drums) initally bringing out a dark rock sound with their first album "Capital Punishment" A short time down the road brought a new sound to the group with " The 16 stiches E.P." and "Progression of Progression" between 1995 and 1998. The new millenium brought forth a unique twist as GRYN released its premier album out of their recent studio recruitment by Last Beat Records out of Fort Worth TX. The new album, ONE, or Our New Earth, infused the power of pounding drums, grinding guitars, reverberating bass licks, and otherworldly sounding vocals, with a lyricism that mired itself in bibiclal versing, such as the songs, "Human Warfare," Tabula Rasa" and "G.R.Y.N." to mention only a few. Gryn was interned in 2001 when Brett Straight left to re-kindle the intellectual fires within; He returned back to school in Hays, KS. Ben Bunker currently fronts for Texas Modern Rock band EVERYLASTHING. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/GRYN">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
