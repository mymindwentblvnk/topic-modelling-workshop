(1)BLACKDEATH is a pure black metal band from Saint Petersburg, Russia with a distinctly primitive, militant and raw sound with a bestial and howling vocal delivery which provides an intensity lacking elsewhere in music of any kind! BLACKDEATH is for the most part Abysslooker (guitar) and Para Bellum (vocals).  
BLACKDEATH began with their early sound as DRAUGWATH (with a very raw sound) and then became BLACK DRAUGWATH (adopting a slightly cleaner, standard black metal sound).  

Their newest releases are:

Katharsis: kalte Lieder aus der Hölle      CD 2010/LP 2011 on Hospital Productions

Chronicles of Hellish Circles      CD 2009 on Hammer of damnation (HOD CD 003)
(This is a collection of tracks mostly from 7" and vinyl only bonus tracks.)
