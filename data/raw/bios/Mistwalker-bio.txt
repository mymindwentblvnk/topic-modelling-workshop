Mistwalker is a one-man black metal project from the province of Newfoundland, Canada. The project was founded in 2011 and has been steadily releasing new music since 2013. The project has cited classic black metal bands such as Darkthrone, Burzum and Immortal as major influences as well as more modern acts such as Mastodon and The Black Dahlia Murder.

The style of the project has shifted and changed over the years. Originally beginning as a raw black metal project, the combination of inspiration from other genres such as progressive metal, ambient music and stoner rock has contributed to the project's sound being constantly in flux. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mistwalker">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
