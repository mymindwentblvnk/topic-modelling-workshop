Marblebog was born as the solo project of Hungarian musician Gábor Varga in 1998. During the early 2000s, Marblebog released two demo tapes focusing on atmospheric black metal, followed by three full-length albums – “Csendhajnal”, “Forestheart” and “Wind of Moors” (the last one being an instrumental ambient release recorded with only synthesizers) – and a large number of splits with bands from around the globe. The band’s only live show, on June 5th 2009 at Matchitehew Assembly in Chicago, marked the end of the first era of the project, Marblebog was laid to rest in 2010.
In 2018, Marblebog has risen from the ashes and recorded its fourth album “Kietlen”. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Marblebog">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
