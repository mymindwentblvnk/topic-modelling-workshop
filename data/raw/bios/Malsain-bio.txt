Malsain was started as a solo project by guitarist/bassist Tenebres in December 2001 in Bergen, Norway. It first became a complete band in early 2003.

Malsain plays mid-tempo extreme-metal with a unique nightmarish ambience and features the most disturbed female growls ever to be heard. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Malsain">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
