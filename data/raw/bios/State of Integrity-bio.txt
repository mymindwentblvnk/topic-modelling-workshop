State Of Integrity is a heavy metal band formed in early 2003 in the Bayside area of Brisbane, Australia. The first line up consisted of Aaron Franklin (vocals), Ben Clayphan (bass), Nick Rhodes (drums) and Brendan Rhodes (guitar).

The style of music they play is a blend of traditional thrash, mid 90's groove and melodic death metal twisted with pure mosh aggression. S.O.I have been inspired to play this style of music by the bands they listened to growing up such as Metallica, Pantera, Sepultura, In Flames, Obituary and Slayer.
