Aguynguerran was raised in 1999 by Nguaroth (vocals, guitars) and Berdunnor (bass). The early years resulted in some demo-work of which the Christreign Annihilation-tape was widely appreciated. The founding members are still the driving force behind the band today, assisted by Jeroenymous (also known from Iconoclasm) on drums.

Through the years, the ideology behind Aguynguerran shifted from purely antichristian to the overall anti-dogmatic concept that can be found in the Perverting the Nazarene Cult-release. This progression in maturity is also reflected in the improved technical skills of the members, of which Nguarothâ€™s accession to Enthroned in 2004 is the ultimate proof. Despite these evolutions, Aguynguerran never turned away from its roots in pure Black Metal.

Perverting the Nazarene Cult represents Aguynguerran in its harshest form: intenser, more obscure and more convincing than ever, the Christreign Annihilators are back with a poisonous deathstab in the face of Morality. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Aguynguerran">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
