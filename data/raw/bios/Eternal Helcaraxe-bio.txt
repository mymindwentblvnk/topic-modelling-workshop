Eternal Helcaraxe came to be in May 2003. Between then and February 2004 began writing for a black metal project based on raw emotion and atmosphere. After several line-up changes both founding members decided to continue as a two piece and in March 2008 released the first MCD entitled “Palest Kingdom”.

Shortly after this release in April of 2008 we were joined by Kozel (ex-Mincing Fury)(cz) on bass, and the lineup was completed in July 2008 when we were re-joined by our first drummer Tyrith who both added a new level of atmosphere and intensity to our sound. Eternal Helcaraxe have performed a full live assault with such bands as Impiety, Shining, Spearhead, 1349, Anaal Nathrakh and Keep of Kalessin.

Kozel regrettably parted ways with EH and in August 2009 we were joined by Thule, which set in stone the new path. Since then have released a second MCD entitled “To Whatever End” and In March 2012 released our first full length album titled Against All Odds which has been released through AbyssRecords (US). Unfortunately due to personal reasons Thule decided to leave EH in January 2013.

In 2014 Eternal Helcaraxe released an official video for a brand new track titled “Flames In The Darkness”. This track is exclusive through “Elemental Nightmares”, a vinyl project which is available now.

A Re-release of the 2010 EP "To Whatever End", which features a re-master of the original recording and 4 brand new bonus tracks has been released through "Unlight Productions" and distributed through "Drakkar Productions" (FR). The original EP has also been released on cassette tape through “Sword Productions” (Portugal) and “Blood and Soil Productions” (Spain).

Right now the band is hard at work writing our second full length album “In Times of Desperation”. More on this as it develops. "Palest Kingdom", "To Whatever End" (CD & Cassette), "Against All Odds" & "To Whatever End - Reinforced" are available now!
