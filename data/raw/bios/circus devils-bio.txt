Circus Devils is a psychedelic rock band founded in 2001 by Robert Pollard, former lead singer and songwriter of the Dayton, Ohio band Guided By Voices. Members include Todd Tobias (music and production), and Tim Tobias (music). Robert Pollard is the band's singer and lyricist. Incorporating a musical alchemy of hard rock and soft rock, tension and ambience, soundscapes, eerie moods, stories, humor, and rock opera theatrics, Circus Devils creates a cinematic music experience.

Between 2001 and 2005 they released four albums on Pollard's Fading Captain imprint (Ringworm Interiors, The Harold Pig Memorial, Pinball Mars and Five). In 2007, Sgt. Disco was released on the Ipecac label. In 2008, the band released the album Ataxia, which continued the band's captivating sonic textures and layers. One year later, the band changed their sound on the album Gringo, which is an acoustic-based collection of songs. Several albums that went back to the band's experimental psychedelic sound continued to follow after: Mother Skinny (2010), Capsized! (2011), When Machines Attack (2013), My Mind Has Seen the White Trick (2013), Escape (2014), Stomping Grounds, (2015), and Laughs Last (2017).

Laughs Last was the band's final album before they broke up. Alongside the album, the band released a greatest hits compilation spanning their entire career, titled Laughs Best (The Kids Eat It Up).
