Belgian 1987 studio project of Gerrit Valckenaers (piano, saxophone, clarinet, synths, samples, electronics) & Gerry Vergult (guitar, bass, synths, samples, electronics).
"Most of the october nights in 1987 you could find Gerry Vergult (Aroma Di Amore/Fred A/Zool) and Gerrit Valckenaers (Adult Fantasies/The Colorist Orchestra) in a desolated Top studio in Gent. At that time and place they sneaky crafted and shaped this Nasca record (while they were supposed to finish a new Fred A. record): an abstract universe where minimal post-punk bass riffs blend together with radio sounds in ‘Nothing Toulouse’, tropical tribal vibes oscillate between futuristic nostalgia and hunted dreams in ‘Ketama’ and ‘Ritz’, a sampled heart beat slowly mutates in mesmerising midnight jazz and a dugged out dub groove of ‘Kamayacha’ transforms into the inner city blues of ‘Josaphat’.
Recorded in 1987, released for the first time in 2019." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nasca">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
