Tear Ceremony is an American electronic and industrial band fronted by Todd Gautreau that was active in the late 1990s. Gautreau then changed his moniker to Sonogram as the music became less dark and more optimistic. Gautreau also currently fronts the indie rock band Crushed Stars. After a SXSW appearance, Crushed Stars signed to Portland's Arena Rock Records. They returned to SXSW and CMJ the following year. Crushed Stars has worked with such producers as Stuart Sikes (Cat Power, White Stripes) and John Congleton (The Walkmen, Modest Mouse) In 2010, Crushed Stars had a college radio it with a psychedelic cover of Nena's 99 Red Balloons. Both Crushed Stars and Sonogram now record for Simulacra Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tear+Ceremony">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
