WAR PLAGUE is an intoxicatingly soul-destroying hyperfast freezing-cold black metal experience sent forth to obliterate the weak. 

Scathing guitar sounds with winding and convoluted riffing, bleak and unnerving black metal shrieks, coupled with all-absorbing war noise atmospheres

WAR PLAGUE has two official releases:
WAR PLAGUE - The Necro Continuum Full Length CD
WAR PLAGUE - Government Issued Murder 7" Vinyl EP

Both are available through Pagan Flames Productions
at PaganFlames.com and the WAR PLAGUE page:
