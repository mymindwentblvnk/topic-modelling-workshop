ENFΔRCE (aka ENFARCE) is a fresh Super-Power Metal band from Finland, formed in 2013. ENFΔRCE keeps on with the energy started by Helloween and Gamma Ray.

ENFΔRCE’s debut album Superhero Diaries – Part I is out in April 30th 2014 and it contains eleven true power metal pieces. The album is a concept album about an arrogant unhuman superhero, Mr. Steel Enforcer. The story of the album in a nutshell is that the superhero receives a signal from the Earth that his assistance is needed to remove all the bad influences and misbehavior off our world. But things don’t always go like planned and he has to suffer from human problems like unemployment etc.

ENFΔRCE asked a few guest musicians for the album, too. Mr. Fastfinger, Matias Kupiainen (Stratovarius) and Francesco Fareri came along with their spectacular guitar solos.
