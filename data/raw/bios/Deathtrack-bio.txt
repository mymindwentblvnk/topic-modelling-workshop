Deathtrack is a four piece hard rock outfit based out of Oslo, Norway. 

Deathtrack shamelessly pays homage to the bands from which they draw their inspiration, such as Alabama Thunderpussy, Metallica and Mot√∂rhead, among others.

The result is KVINESDALROCK, named after Kvinesdal, the city in the dirty south from which they hail.
