2. Aziza is a studio album by English jazz bassist Dave Holland together with saxophonist Chris Potter, guitarist Lionel Loueke, and drummer Eric Harland. The album was released on October 14, 2016 via Holland's own Dare2 Records label.

Dave Holland explained that the name Aziza has come from one of their songs, “Aziza Dance,” written by Lionel Loueke. In Loueke's birthplace of Benin, Africa, Aziza means a supernatural race of forest dwellers giving practical and spiritual advice. The album features eight original compositions—two from each band member. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Aziza">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
