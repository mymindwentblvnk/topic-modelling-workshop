Lumina Polaris is a christian rock/metal band from Oulu, Finland. They were originally formed in the spring of 2000. Their sound is similar (as well as their hometown) to Sentenced except that they sing in Finnish and from a different point of view on life/death. The group won the Finnish "gospel championship" competition during 2005.

Their first actual release was Veren merkki -single in 2003 which was sold out quite quickly and received positive feedback. After two years the first full length was ready, epicly titled Imperiumi. The album brought the band new listeners and was also liked by the old fans. Before and after releasing Imperiumi, Lumina Polaris also toured all over Finland on various festivals and events.
Now, after three years of releasing any new material they released Vastaisku in Immortal Metal Fest, 18.4.2009.
