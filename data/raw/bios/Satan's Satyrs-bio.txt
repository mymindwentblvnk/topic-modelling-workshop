Loud, dirty, gritty rock 'n roll band from Herndon, Virginia. They formed in the summer of 2009. The band features Clayton “Claytanas” Burgess (bass, vocals), Jarrett Nettnin (guitar) and Stephen Fairfield (drums). They incorporate elements of punk, doom, stoner and garage rock into their music. In April 2013, they played Roadburn Festival twice, first as personally selected guests of Electric Wizard at the 'Electric Acid Orgy', and then a day later performing a set completely dedicated to Blue Cheer. Merging the riffing, the tone, the fuzz, and the cult-horror worship of the ultra-doom underground with the unbridled energy, lo-fi production, and fuck-you attitude of garage punk seems like such a natural fit that it’s impossible to believe that Satan’s Satyrs are the first band to accomplish it, but on ‘Wild Beyond Belief!’ the band have pulled it off almost flawlessly and deliver a refreshing blast of youthful energy in the staid wasteland of modern heavy metal. This latest pressing has been fully mastered from the source files to qtr inch tape by Jaime Gomez Arellano (Cathedral, Hexvessel, The Gates of Slumber, etc.) for maximum warmth, volume and thickness of sound. The band released their second studio album, "Die Screaming", on April 20th, 2014, through Bad Omen Records.
