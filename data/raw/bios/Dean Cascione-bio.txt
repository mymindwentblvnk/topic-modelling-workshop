Dean Cascione is an American Neoclassical Shred Guitarist who is an Innovative force in today's Shred Guitar Scene. Dean was born in Bronx, New York and raised in a small suburban town right outside of Worcester MA. He began playing guitar at the age of 10 and built his first cherry wood guitar in his 9th grade woodshop class. His Neoclassical Roots stem from his early training with Master Jazz and Classical Guitarist Steven Cancelli. "It was Steve who exposed my love for Baroque Music”.
      Dean is also a pupil of the legendary Joe Stump( 6th top Shredder in the world - Voted by: Guitar One Magazine) and has collaborated with world renowned Guitar Virtuoso George Bellas. "Joe Stump is a great mentor. He's truly an amazing player and great friend. His inspiration has been key in helping me find my own unique sound and identity. During the days when Shred was dying and Grunge was the rave, it was guitar hero’s like Joe Stump & George Bellas who carried the Neoclassical torch high and proud - Their strength and passion inspired me to continue writing, playing and recording the music I love."  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dean+Cascione">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
