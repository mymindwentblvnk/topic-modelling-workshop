Nektar is probably the most German-like of the Seventies British bands, a fame that owes a lot to the town in which this band was founded (Hamburg) and to their stylistic approach (Assimilated to Krautrock). Nektar was formed in 1969 by Allan Freeman (keyboards & vocals), Roye Albrighton (guitars & vocals), Derek More (bass, Mellotron & vocals) and Ron Howden (drums).

Their earliest albums were hard rock that drew heavily from the space-rock and Pink Floyd styles of the same period. The 70â€™s gave them the occasion to issue some masterpieces, like for example "A Tab in the Ocean (1972)  "Remember the Future" (1973) and "Recycled" (1975). Each is a conceptual album that is a nice blend of melodic guitar and keyboards with a vocal story. "Journey To The Centre Of The Eye" is a mindblowing epic with lots of echoplex guitar and dual Mellotrons which is quite in tune with the Krautrock stuff going on around them, yet is definitely British. "Magic is a Child" had shorter songs and were less less satisfying. 

Nektar's entire back catalogue has been re-vamped and remastered and is about to be re-issued in the USA, supported by a tour.  A new Studio CD "Book of Days" is targeted for 20th March 2007 release on EMI - Caroline.

The band has recently been joined for their upcoming tour by the bass player Peter Pichl (Running Wild and other bands).
