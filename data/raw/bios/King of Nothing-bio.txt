Based out of Wixom, Michigan, USA; King of Nothing is a mix of sludge, doom and stoner metal started in 2010 by Devin Wholihan, the sole member. Devin created this project as a cathartic response to the frustrations of the world around him. There is currently only one release the debut/demo "Dark Trench I Tread". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/King+of+Nothing">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
