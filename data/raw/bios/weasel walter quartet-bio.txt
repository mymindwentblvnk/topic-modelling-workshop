The music of the Weasel Walter Quartet harkens back to that of free jazz legends like Albert Ayler, Cecil Taylor, Masayuki Takayanagi and Peter Brotzmann - there is an emphasis on overt speed and violence while never losing sight of articulation and interplay. The group is interested in power, excitement and fury - the kind created by the dripping sweat and blood of its members’ manic performances. The quartet doesn’t dabble in rock or any other idiomatic cliches - the music is 100% abstract improvisation: dense, furious and modern. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Weasel+Walter+Quartet">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
