Since their inception, they’ve screamed two things: “Wu-Tang is Forever” and “Wu-Tang is For the Children.” Recently celebrating 25+ years of WU, we now know how that Legacy becomes a Dynasty.

2nd Generation WU picks up their own torch, lit from their parents, and blazes a trail all their own. Led by the core of GFTD – iNTeLL (son of U-God) and PXWER (son of Method Man) and featuring SUN GOD (son of Ghostface Killah), and Young Dirty Bastard (son of the late Old Dirty Bastard), 2nd Generation WU has split off the Wu-Tang family tree and created a new branch all their own. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/2nd+Generation+Wu">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
