The Evolution is a blazing heavy metal band with a lot of attitude and talent. Formed late 2002 in Kuopio, Finland by Kalle Vainio, Eemeli Vainio, Ville Väisänen & Tuomas Koponen. A couple of months after the band was formed, we recorded our first demo "The Evolution" , which contained 5 original songs from us. It was released in summer 2003 and became very popular.

At the time Tero Liimatainen was handling the 2nd guitar but he left the band in summer 2004 as well as our singer Tuomas. Both for the lack of time...

After some time Topi Pitkänen replaced Tero and we tried out a couple of singers before Youzzie H. became our vocalist in the very beginning of 2005. The band started perfoming live on gigs and working on the next release "Extented Play" (2005) with 4 original songs and a cover song "Wings Of Darkness" from a finnish band called Tarot. The EP was a huge hit on the internet, especially in Mikseri.net where the song called "Hard Rain" gathered up to 40.000 listeners! During the same year we filmed a music video of the song called "Justice" , and the same song ended up being on a compilation-cd called "Noise.fi Vol. 2".

In 2006 the band went to a studio to record a ballad called "Brothers", which was released only on the internet.

In 2008 Youzzie H. had to leave the band and our original singer Tuomas made a comeback.

Our latest EP which is also called "The Evolution" was released in early 2009. It contains 6 original songs from us, including a remake of "Brothers".
