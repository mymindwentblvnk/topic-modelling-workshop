SinophiA is a Serbian heavy metal band that combine power metal / thrash metal genres in their music.
The band was formed by Stefan Apatovic, Miodrag Fodora & Nemanja Apatovic in Novi Sad in 2011.

SinophiA's music is often described as the style of Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, combined with 80’s thrash metal. The most distinctive element of the band’s sound is the stuttering right-hand gallop of rhythm guitarist Stephan Apatovic. Overtop of this gallop are typically laid strong melodic hooks, sometimes doubled by two guitars playing in harmony. The vocals are often high-pitched, but express a full range, while the rhythm section uses thrash and power metal techniques such as double-bass-drumming to keep the speed and energy high.

SinophiA lyrics tend to deal with theological issues such as punishment, sin and pride, destiny, faith and the apocalypse. Many of the band’s recent songs have been written around a theme and a story.

Miodrag Fodora (Vocals)
Stefan Apatovic (Guitar, Back Vocals)
Attila Lukacs (Guitar)
Nemanja Apatovic (Bass)
