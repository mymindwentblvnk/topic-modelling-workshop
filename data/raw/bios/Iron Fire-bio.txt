Iron Fire is a Danish power and speed metal band which formed in 1995 under the name 'Misery'.  The band soon changed their name to 'Decades of Darkness', then finally, to 'Iron Fire'.  In 1998, they released their first demo, which was received extremely well, and they signed to Noise Records.  Their debut album sounded a lot like common power metal bands, such as Hammerfall, Helloween & Running Wild. What makes them different from other power metal bands is the vocalist, Martin Steene, who has a voice similar to Vince Neil (Mötley Crüe). 

The year 2000 saw the release of Iron Fire's debut album, 'Thunderstorm' , which received rave reviews.  The band's sophmore effort, 'On the Edge' (2001), was not viewed as the bands best work by critics.  The band has never had a stable line-up, with multiple changes coming from 2001 - 2006.  March 2006 saw the return of Iron Fire with their third studio album 'Revenge' (from Napalm Records). The two albums after that, 'Blade of Triumph' (2007) and 'To the Grave' (2009), went on to receive good reviews by critics. They also marked what can be called the band's viking trilogy.

After an album 'Metalmorphosized' (2010), which contained reworked versions of left-over material from then bands' first decade, they released 'Voyage of the Damned' (2012). It marked a turn towards sci-fi themed lyrics and artwork while also containing more keyboards, without losing the heavyness. A video clip was shot for the single Leviathan. 

In 2014 the band released a stand alone single 'A Token of My Hatred' (Virgin Steele cover) on Crime Records, Also on Crime Records the band released 'Among the Dead' (2016), which is probably the heaviest Iron Fire album to date. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Iron+Fire">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
