2. Lawnmower. Judging by the cover art you might think Lawnmower worship at the altar of 90’s pop/punk but you would only be half right. They also worship at the altar of 90’s indie rock. For those who think pop/punk and indie rock peaked in the 90’s (and who doesn’t?), well, Lawnmower certainly agree with you. “Four songs about life, love, and testicular cancer at Degrassi High.” Perhaps that’s underselling it though? While the band could certainly be considered a throwback to the finer sounds of the 90’s there is also a modern charm at play here. There is also some outstanding songwriting displayed that will bring you back for more.

Lawnmower quietly began as a bedroom project from singer/songwriter Travis Bravender in 2010. Bravender released Lawnmower’s debut LP, Franchise Wings, later that year which showcased a songwriter heavily indebted to 90’s indie/pop/punk rock. Fast forward three years and Lawnmower is now a full-fledged band who have just released their proper debut 7” on Save Your Generation Records. The Whack Yer Brain EP expands on the band’s roots and showcases a bright future to come. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lawnmower">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
