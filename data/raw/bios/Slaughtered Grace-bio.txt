Crossover thrash from Lodi, NJ. This is the band's CD from 1989. It's more on the thrash metal side than hardcore but it rules. Slaughtered Grace also released a 7" in 1989 called "Terror Unleashed", which has the song "Disability" from this CD as well as the EP title track. Guitarist Ron Paci and vocalist Sal Bee went on to form the hardcore band Sardonica in the early '90s. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Slaughtered+Grace">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
