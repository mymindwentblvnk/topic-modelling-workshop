Profile:
Mr. Nitro (born Derrick Booker) has produced beats with Queen Latifah's Flavor Unit imprint, under the name Daddy D. After a spell of disillusionment with labels MCA and Elektra Records (who couldn't comprehend his musical concept), he ventured out on his own with Nitro Entertainment, exposing the burgeoning talent in his hometown of Oklahoma City. His 2000 compilation CD, Hustlin' Pays, is a project that showed off Oklahoma's brightest stars. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Daddy+D">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
