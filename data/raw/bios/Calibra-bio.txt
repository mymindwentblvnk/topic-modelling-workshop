Calibra started as a curious project letting the members express their experimental ideas through music. Inspired by bands as Mogwai, Mono and Godspeed You! Black Emperor - Calibra only played together long enough to release the EP "Hello, Greetings and Welcome!" before they split-up continuing with other projects. Calibra only performed around three concerts in local places around Höganäs and their popularity only reached a close circle of fans.

For the time being there are no plans of reunite Calibra. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Calibra">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
