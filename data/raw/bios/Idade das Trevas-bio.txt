Idade das Trevas is a scream of fury.

A form of expression of all our inconformism burning in our interior, a representation of HATE against all humanity and the hypocrisy that plagues it; in the name of our HONOR, of our PRIDE and our will to evolve!

A splendid hail to all those who are sincere with the
nature of your own being; and THE REST MAY ROT!
