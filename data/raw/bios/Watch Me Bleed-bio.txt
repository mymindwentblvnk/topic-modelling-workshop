Watch Me Bleed is a hardcore band from Dresden/Germany.
The band was found in spring 2006. At this time WMB consisted of Ritti (guitar), Falk (drums) and Gregor (vox). Based on the idea to make the music they like they started to practice not very seriously, but after a while it became more and more important to make something "real" and say what they have to say. In summer 2006 Föö (vox) joined WMB to complete the singing parts but WMB was still searching for a bass player who fits to them.. In April 2007 they recorded a "demo" (without bass) in their practice room, but they weren't very satisfied with these songs 'cause this was not really the sound they wanted to do... it was very frustrating but fortunately Andreas who supported the band since the beginning helped them out of our desperation. He started to play bass in end of summer 2007 and so the line up of Watch Me Bleed was completed! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Watch+Me+Bleed">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
