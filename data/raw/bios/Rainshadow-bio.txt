Forming in Melbourne in 2006, Rainshadow merge melancholy and darkness with melody and rock.

Latest album 'Waters Imperium' contains ten tracks that explore ideas of loss and separation as well as the beauty found in depressing places. The focus is on doomy guitar riffs with keyboards and catchy choruses to truly capture the atmosphere. 

With tracks played on national radio station Triple J and coverage in international media, Rainshadow aim to become permanent players in the dark rock/doom
landscape.
