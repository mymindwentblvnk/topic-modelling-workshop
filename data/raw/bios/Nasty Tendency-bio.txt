Nasty Tendency are a heavy metal band founded in Forlì, Italy, in 2007. Their sound is influenced both by 70’s and 80’s U.S. hard-rock groups (Riot, Twisted Sister, Lizzy Borden…) and European ones, such as Grim Reaper, Ozzy Osbourne and Warlock, but the band always manages to maintain its own style. Nasty Tendency consist of Nikky Nails (vocals), Luke Nasty Kidd (guitars and backing vocals), Johnny Curly (drums) and Maury Lyon (bass and backing vocals), the latter having joined the band few months ago and being crucial for the group’s ultimate line-up. In 2007, after a dozen gigs and a 3-track demo tape, the band decided to write more songs to be able to record a full length in early 2008. Between January and March 2008 the band recorded 8 songs at the Convolution Studio in Bagnacavallo (Ravenna). After the end of the recording sessions, the band’s most pressing issue was to replace the then bass-player Max Mello, who had quit the band. After playing some gigs with some temporary substitutes, Maury Lyon, the long-standing bass-player of Gunfire, an 80’s heavy metal band from Ancona, joined the band. Currently the band has signed with the label My Graveyard with a new debut album scheduled for january 2009 and is ready to play as many concerts as possible, both in Italy and abroad.
Just at the beginning of 2009 Nikki left suddenly the band but luckly a new singer has found: KC DOLL is now with us!
Other news is that young powerfull drummer ANDREW SPRING has started a collaboration with our band..the CD "WILD AND NASTY" is out now with MY GRAVEYARD PROD..CHECK IT OUT!
