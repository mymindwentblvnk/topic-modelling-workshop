Disposable are a Metal band from Edinburgh, Scotland. Mixing our favourite aspects of Metal to metal to make that Thrashy, Chunky 'Dispo' sound. Formed in late 2009, and released "The Disposable EP" in late 2011. Currently writing tracks to feature on an upcoming debut album which we hope to have completed  soon. We have been playing shows in and around our home town Edinburgh, as well as shows in Glasgow and Dundee. 
Disposable is William Robertson (bass, vocals), Andrew Anderson (guitars), Jack Batcharj (guitars),  and Liam Tucker (drums).
