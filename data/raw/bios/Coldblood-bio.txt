Band formed in January 1992 practicing a fast and aggressive Death Metal influenced by great names in the style of the 80s and 90s, combined with a profane and anti-christian thematic. In September of that year, was recorded the Demo-Tape "Terror Stench" launching Coldblood to concerts nationwide. After a long break the band returns in 2000 to release the Demo-CD "... And It Comes The Winter" and after a few presentations were given another break. In 2005 the band finally returns to release the demo-CD "Reicarnating a New Black God" bringing a Coldblood more brutal, violent and bestial than ever. In 2007 the band released the highly anticipated debut album "Under The Blade I Die "and went on making presentations throughout Brazil and sometimes sharing the stages with bands as Cannibal Corpse, Master, Onslaught, Mayhem, Gräfenstein among others. Following the release of debut album in 2010 the band performed a South American Tour named "UnderThe South American Tour 2010 I Die." in countries as Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia. In 2011 was released a Split-CD Coldblood / Luvart - The First demo's and the band continued working on a new release. In celebration of the 20th birthday of the band was released in 2012 the EP "The Other Gods" wich has 5 new sings and brings as a bonus the first 3 demos. Coldblood follows it´s saga preparing a new release scheduled to June of 2013 willing to destroy the Headbanger´s eardrums wich are avid for a Death Metal made by who is acting with dedication to the underground scene for the two last decades. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Coldblood">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
