In 2006 Oriax was formed in Shelton, CT with members Joe Divita, Ken Bullard, Marc Lewis, Elton Castee and Joe Joaquim they planned to create a true death metal band because of the lack of any in the 203 CT area.  After a few songs were created they realized that bassist Joe Joaquim was not what they were looking for so he left on good terms.  Josh Bugarchich joined Oriax on bass shortly after to create more songs and play a few shows.  Josh left Oriax due to personal differences with drummer Elton.  After a few months Mike Tobey joined on bass and wrote many songs with Oriax and played a majority of the shows.  Elton Castee was asked later on to leave the band because of personal and musical differences.
After a long search for a drummer Lee Swanson of Crawling Chaos said he would play drums for Oriax.  After throwing out all of their old material and writing 3 songs with Lee and playing 2 shows with him Mike Tobey decided to leave the band because of changing musical taste and so he could focus on his band Starvation.
Antonio Esposito of Black Regalia joined Oriax on bass a few weeks later and now Oriax seems to have a solid line up.
Oriax's sound has changed and matured over the years and now deliver more technical, melodic and brutal music than before.
