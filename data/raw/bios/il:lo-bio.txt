il:lo was born from the meeting of Dejan Dejado and Andreas Schütz in Prague in 2010. These two producers, aged 30 and 31, shared common interests and they decided to collaborate in 2012. After six months of to-ing and fro-ing between the two musicians, they released their first EP, Distances. Coming together in Paris, they released Jaro in 2014. Both titles fell into the trip hop/world genre.

The French duo takes their inspiration from their travels and takes the names of their tracks from the towns they have visited. il:lo’s sound is a blend of acoustic and synthetic melodies. It could well be perceived as heavy as it is light, with its sombre bass lines as well as floaty brass tones. Usually categorised as downtempo music, it takes place among Bonobo, Tycho or Catching flies’ universe.
