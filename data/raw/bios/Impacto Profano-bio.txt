Formed in 2001 by Lord Anti-Christ (drums), Impacto Profano's goal is to disseminate, ideologically and musically, obscurity, and also to raise the flag of the battle against hypocritical religions which enslave humanity with false doctrines and cultures of alienation.   
On April the 4th, 2003, Impacto Profano debuted time live at Duque de Caxias - RJ, alongside the hordes Unearthly, Viking Throne and Iconoclasm (Belgium).   It was then time to perpetuate the band's hymns, so, on March 2004, Impacto Profano entered Fast Forward Studios to record their first demo CD, "Propagation of the Blasphemy". However, due to some delays and constant line-up changes, recordings could only be finished in mid 2005 and this demo never actually saw the light of day.   
On june 2006, the band reentered Fast Forward Studios to record their second demo album, "Invocation to Destruction of Jehovah and Christianity", which counts with the title track and two others, "Fuck God, Glory to Black Metal" and "Domain of the Black Art". 
  On October the 24th, 2008, Impacto Profano made its most important concert to this date, supporting Mayhem at the All Rock Point festival in Duque de Caxias - RJ. On that night a live CD was recorded, which will be released soon.
Impacto Profano is also featured on the upcoming release of "The Return of Cain - Tribute to Amen Corner" with a cover for the song "Zigurates Baal", which will be put out by Extreme Metal Records, Belial Songs and Lys Aeon labels.   
Impacto Profano is now getting ready to release their first full-lenght album, which should be out later this year.
