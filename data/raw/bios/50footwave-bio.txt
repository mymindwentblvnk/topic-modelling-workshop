50 Foot Wave is an American alternative rock band, formed in 2003. The band is fronted by Kristin Hersh, who writes the group's songs with collaborative efforts from the other group members in composing and arranging the music. 

The group's name is a reference to both an illustration and the term for the 50-foot sound wave of the lowest F tone audible to the human ear. 

The band sometimes abbreviates its name as L'~, using the Roman numeral for 50. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/50FootWave">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
