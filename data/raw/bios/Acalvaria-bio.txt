Acalvaria formed in early 2007. Christian (Coma) and Nick (Gates of Enoch) met up at a Coma show which featured Spencer (Gates of Enoch) on as stand-in "guest vocals."  After writing a few songs, recruiting Josh to play bass, and in searching for that final element, adding Jorge as second guitars, Acalvaria was complete. Music designed for public executions, self immolations, and of course body disposal. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Acalvaria">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
