The band Audionom was created in the spring of 1999 primarily influenced by german rock from the early seventies, then called krautrock, but also had connections to punkrock. The band played at places like Harvest (lo-fi summer festival), Fylkingen (scene for experimental music), Accelerator (club) and Emmaboda (festival for indie music). Mostly we made gigs at clubs in Stockholm. After three and a half years and many different members coming and going, the band was dispersed, and stayed that way for a year or so. In 2004 the band teamed up again and did some live performances at special occasions. Audionom has released a 7" EP "Audionom"(2001/2002) and a split LP "Audionom/Sickoakes split"(2002) with the postrockgroup Sickoakes and a retrospective cd album "Retrospektiv"(2005 eur, 2007 us), was released in the states at Kemado rec. This summer/fall a split single with Skull defekts will be released at ideal recordings. We are also working on a new album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Audionom">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
