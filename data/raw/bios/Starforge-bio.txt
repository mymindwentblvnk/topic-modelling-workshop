The story of Starforge began in the year 2007 when Andy Suppradit decided it was time to unleash his own brand of melodic death metal upon the Australian metal scene. Inspired by the sounds of the Scandinavian scene and elements from Thrash, Death, Black and Power metal, Andy spent 2008 composing what would be Starforge's first demo 'Infinite'. 

Before the songs had been written, Josh Mcmaster was chosen to be the vocalist. This was a natural choice as Josh and Andy have been working together musically since 2004 through many projects including grindcore band Mutant On A Forklift. 

Leonard Ong initially joined the band as a keyboardist but later switched to bass due to personal preference. Leonard and Andy met during their studies at University and immediately knew they were on the same path. 

Brad Hunt was next to climb aboard as drummer for the band. Brad had invited Andy to join the band Anjeliina in 2006 which dissolved to form End of Aeon in 2008. During these times Andy and Brad had many discussions to form a melodic death metal band but the opportunity never occured. In 2009 Brad was asked by Andy to join the band, and soon after he left End of Aeon. 

Finally Michael Aldeguer was the last member to join and complete Starforge. Michael was an old friend of the band who would watch Josh and Andy rehearse for Mutant On A Forklift on a regular basis. After witnessing his abilities on the guitar it was evident that Michael had to be in Starforge. 

In mid 2009 Starforge released their first demo Infinite. At the moment Starforge are currently rehearsing and writing new material with plans to hit the live scene in the near future.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Starforge">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
