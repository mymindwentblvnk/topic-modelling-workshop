Born and raised in Hackney, London, Eliza Rose has been writing and singing her own songs since the age of 15. Years of working Saturdays in a record shop exposed her to a wide range of musical styles and helped develop her unique vocal style. There is a smokey seam of Soul, Blues and Jazz running through her music. She has an aesthetic influenced by a love for the glamorous, damaged heroines of American stage and screen whilst retaining a quintessentially British wit and writing style.

Eliza Rose is not a throwback artist or a retro act but rather a modern singer determined to bring back seductive Soul and music with a strong sex appeal. Her first single is a cover of T-Pain's "Up Down (Do This All Day)" that has been turned on it's head in collaboration with producer Mkulu. Her first release "The Moonshine EP" will be out in February 2015. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Eliza+Rose">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
