2. Shovelhead is an all-original power trio based out of Freehold, New Jersey. Critically acclaimed with a dedicated following, they've been at the forefront of the New Jersey music scene since evolving from The Lemmings in 1998.

Hard driving, raw and aggressive... A unique blend of psychedelia and heavy blue-based riff rock... Shovelhead's powerful sound hints of rock influences from the 60's and 70's, yet their dark melodies, hypnotic rhythms and rare improvisational style is anything but retro.

Intermingled with wicked, meandering jams, Shovelhead's high-energy live shows offer blistering performances and superior musicianship.

Shovelhead is Jim LaPointe (guitar and lead vocals), Sha Zaidi (bass) and Mike Scott (drums)

InfluencesClutch, Sabbath, Zeppelin, Maiden, Priest, Deep Purple
