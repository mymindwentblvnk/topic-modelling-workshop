Kin of Ettins is a doom metal band.

Kin of Ettins first came into being in late 2004, when vocalist/guitarist Jotun, formerly of Texas doomites Midian, began writing & recording songs for a new project. Having been inspired by 1-piece bands such as Bathory, Falkenbach & Sisters of Mercy, Kin of Ettins was originally intended to be a single man project with emphasis purely on recorded material. However, a change of mind came when it became obvious that not only would live shows be a must, but creative input would be more inspired with the right band chemistry. So long-time friend & bassist extraordinaire Donar was recruited into the fold in early 2006. Now an actual group, Donar's exceptional playing, technological know-how, and professsional attitude amplified the work ethic exponentially and by late '06 the first official recordings were being envisioned. Early 2007 saw the completion of this demo with it's release in mid-February coinciding with Kin of Ettins's public debut upon creatiion of this page. The band now forges ahead setting their sights on a more complete line-up, professsional recordings & many live appearances across the bourgeoning Texas doom metal scene & beyond. Former Midian guitarist Hamlett has stepped into the ranks as of June. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kin+of+Ettins">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
