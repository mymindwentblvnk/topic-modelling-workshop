Paradox Obscur were formed in January 2014 by Toxic Razor & Kriistal Ann in order to step into a more minimal direction than their previous projects and haul a diverse universe consisting of dark hardware synthesizers under a cold drape of spiraling electronics. Their live shows are characterized by the raw energy and extended passionate female vocals. 
The real time recordings for each of their albums capturing the essence and magic of the moment without any use of additional DAW's or Plug-ins in order to stay loyal to the real old school feeling & vibe, consists as a true trademark of Paradox Obscur.
