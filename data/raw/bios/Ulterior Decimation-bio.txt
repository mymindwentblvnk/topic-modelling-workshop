Ulterior Decimation originally consists of Amir, Firdaus and Nuar.Formed back in 2002, the band has been working hard in order to produce a good quality Death Metal music. Heavily influenced by bands with the likes of Hate Eternal, Deeds Of Flesh, Nile, Morbid Angel; the band created some songs for the upcoming future release. A little problem occurred when Nuar decided to leave the band for a while to concentrate on his work. The band then became a duo where only Amir and Firdaus continue and proceed to the next level where a 2-song promo has been recorded recently. The songs are known as "Profligacy Of The Wretch" and "Maelstrom Of Debauchery". After searching for the right person to complete the band, we finally found Mukriz from Meridian Sign and the band is now happy working as a 3-piece band. The recent members of Ulterior Decimation are: Amir: Guitars/Vocals, Firdaus: Drums, Mukriz: Guitar  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ulterior+Decimation">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
