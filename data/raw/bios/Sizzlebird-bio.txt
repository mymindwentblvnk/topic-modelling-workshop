Two years of production and SizzleBird is entering the music world.

Using computer software and recording his own sounds he produces a variety including drum and bass, chillout and breakbeat. 

His passion for music started from a young age, learning the violin from the age of 5. In love with chilled ideas, his music has evolved and become a sound of its own.
