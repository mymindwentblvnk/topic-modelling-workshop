For a certain group of metal-fans Cromm Cruac is not a new name. This band is still producing their contradictive style of metal, as they did since February of 1992. In this time Cromm Cruac made three demotapes, increasing their technique and developing a style not comparable to current metal-styles. 
After three demotapes the band released two CD’s on Firebreath / T.E.R.-records called ‘Senecio’ and ‘Meadows of Madness’. Despite of the great reviews both of them got, the band remained underground. 
After all these years Cromm Cruac is playing in the same line-up from the beginning. For a long time Herman Hofman took over the vocal parts and Daniël Centiago played the bass for one year, but nowadays Cromm Cruac is back in it’s original line-up. 
In 2010 Cromm Cruac finished their 3th, selftitled album. Mostly recorded at Reinout’s homestudio. It has a raw, natural sound. They kept the recordingprocess as basic as possible to stay as close as they could to their live sound. Ten staggering new songs on a little silver disc. Check out their new CD!!!
