Fractured Spine is an atmospheric death/doom metal band from HÃ¤meenlinna, Finland. Although the band has composed since the 90's, the oldest song on the debut album "Songs of Slumber" dates back to 2004. The band consists of two core-members Antti & Timo and to many people's surprise, draws its main influences from outside the metal genre, based on the British atmospheric/progressive rock and shoegazing. Starting with instrumentals, ballads and gothic metal songs, the earlier material utilized no unclean vocals. However, almost no songs were ever released to the public until 2011 (except for the very limited edition demo "Frost" in 2008). These days the style has slowly taken a heavier tone with baritone guitars and growling vocals.
 
Fractured Spine has a very "indie style" approach to making music. All of the songs are recorded and mixed at the band's own Studio Fracture, with only mastering, publishing and distribution given to professionals outside the band. Thus, allowing the music to sound exactly like the band intended it to. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fractured+Spine">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
