Schrei aus Stein (named after the Werner Herzog film) is an ambient / black metal project from Lafayette, Colorado, USA

Schrei aus Stein is a new project from R. Hagen of the long-running dark ambient group Encomiast. This project explores a meditative black metal style, inspired by the experience of climbing in bleak alpine terrain in Colorado and seeking to recapture the profound isolation amidst such an imposing and difficult landscape. The new release with Starlight Temple Society is Schrei aus Stein's debut. It sounds like the tree outside your window asking if it can come inside because of the cold. Encomiast's main man R. Hagen returns with Schrei Aus Stein, his new vision which continues to explore Encomiast's lush melodic ambience while melding it with the down-beat black metal of greats Velvet Cacoon, Xasthur and Procer Veneficus. "Talus" (the title of the new album) contains 5 lengthy tracks which should strike a chord with enthusiasts of raw yet serene dark music. Recorded on gold CD and comes in DVD box, Limited to 200 units.
