Hawaii formed in 1982 by guitarist Marty Friedman that came to life as Vixen (not to be confused with the 80's female band of the same name) in 1981 hailing from Honolulu, Hawaii. Hawaii was one of the two notable bands from Honolulu, Hawaii (the other being Sacred Rite). After Hawaii split up Marty formed band Cacophony with exellent Jason Becker.

Hawaii was one of two notable bands to originate from the Aloha State (the other being Sacred Rite), and is one of several bands featuring guitarist extraordinaire Marty Friedman. Having left the mainland and the band Deuce behind him (see the Tension page for more info on that band), Marty toyed with a band called Vixen before forming this band. Interestingly, the vocalist who later joined here (Eddie Day) was also in Deuce back when they were popular. As with many early Shrapnel releases, One Nation Underground is heavy on the guitar work, being a fine showcase for the up-and-coming Friedman. After two albums and an EP, Hawaii folded, with Friedman later seen in Cacophony before moving on to fame and fortune with Megadeth. He currently is working solo, both in metallic and non-metallic capacities.
