Nothing more to eat from Helsinki/Finland have been together since 2008 and the early years was a turbulent time filled with violent shows, broken bones, police and ambulances. 2012 they went on tour to conquer Europe and as appreciation someone stole their tour van.

Back in Finland they went right to Posti Studios in Helsinki and recorded their self titled debut album which will be released through We’re Having A Blast Records the 1st of March 2013.

The album is 14 songs long and the music is based on grindcore and d-beat hardcore mixed together with surf, crust, stoner and straight up rock. It’s all about hard hitting riffs and fast blastbeats with various artistical inserts. The lyrics are written in disgust, irony, humor and symbolism. The themes vary from personal feuds and social criticism to the hustle and beer drinking.
