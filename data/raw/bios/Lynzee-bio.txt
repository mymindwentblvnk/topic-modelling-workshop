After 24 years of keeping the faith & the exit of yet another drummer, on October 15th 2008 remaining members of the band Lynzee created a basic Myspace as a tribute to their history and a place for fans past & present to meet. They had no idea what would come of this little endeavor…By December 2008 the band found new life when they were discovered by RETROSPECT RECORDS one the worlds largest independent rock/metal labels. They were immediately offered a multi-release record deal. They agreed to re-release 3 of their classic albums complete with new unreleased material. These albums are NOW AVAILABLE at: Retrospect Records : www.retrospectrecords.com

The ultimate bonus was the return of one of the original drummers Bill Haertel… as of 2010 Lynzee is BACK IN BLACK and in the studio currently recording their all new FOURTH album due out December 2010.

Now for a Little History…

ANCIENT HISTORY (1986-1988):

Based out of Southern California LYNZEE was formed by founding member Richard Lindsey in 1985. After working the ‘local’ backyard party scene of Southern California, from 1982-1986 Richard looked to form the Classic Two guitar tandem style metal approach (ala Judas Priest/Iron Maiden/AC/DC) combined with the Classic ARENA rock (Van Halen) rhythm edge. The result was the 1st original line-up in 1986: Richard Lindsey (Guitars), Jeff Fedak (Guitars), Joey Velasco (Drums), Mike VanDenburg (Bass) & Kelly Wilde (Vocals). This line-up didn’t last and Richard stepped up to the task of frontman/vocalist in addition to playing guitar. The next line-up included guitar wizard Patrick Park and Bassist Damian Pampena. By 1988 Joey left the band & was replaced with Richards former band mate Greg Jackson who he first worked with in the band DC Sparks. Fate can be cruel as Greg suffered a family setback forcing him to leave the band. 

LYNZEE (1989-1992):

1989 was a banner year with the addition of drum phenom Bill Haertel. A professional session drummer and instructor he was capable of any musical style set before him. Bill helped Lynzee evolve into the clockwork precision style that became the signature sound of the band. With this line-up the band became a force to be reckoned with. Production began on their first EP the self titled debut "Lynzee" working with Producer Jimmy Hoyson at Capitol Studios, The Summa Group & Chapel Studios. Upon completion the Lynzee EP / Demo caught the ear & eye of Engineer/Producer Charlie Watts. The band began a non-stop schedule of performing in every venue & club in Southern California upon completion the Lynzee EP / Demo. The band received recognition as they had endorsement deals with Charvel / Jackson Guitars, Shure Microphones, BBE, Dean Markley, Musiclord Cabinets, Dunlop Picks, G&L Guitars and more.

Throughout 1990 they never stopped recording at the Batcave Studio with Richard engineering & producing. These sessions would become the Classic “Victim of Nirvana” album released by Darknight Entertainment and currently being re-released through RETROSPECT RECORDS in 2009. At this time Michael Mansfield entered the picture, eventually taking on the role of Manager & promoter working closely with Richard. The band then recorded "Lynzee Front Page Sessions" at Front Page Recorders in Costa Mesa CA in 1990 releasing it thru Darknight Entertainment. Once again followed up with a rigorous live performance schedule. You name the place they played it, The Whisky, The Roxy, The Troubadour, The Marquee, FM Station and so on.

LYNZEE (1992-1993):

After working with the band over a 2 plus year run, Bill had to leave the band knowing he would “always” be a part of Lynzee. The answer to this dilemma came in the form of John Chip Hanna a hard working drummer who went out of his way to prove he was the only man for the job. After the completion of Front Page Sessions (featuring Bill on Drums) and the new 1992/93 line-up in place Lynzee inked a deal with Statue Records. Lynzee dumped the Statue Records contract & broke away with Charlie & Richard helming the project. They began pre-production on their next album. Upon completion of the new album "Man of the People" they inked a record deal with Caprice International Records. 

By 1993 the band worked to promote the new release playing a demanding schedule for a period of time. After nearly 10 years of hard work the band decided they needed a break, for Damian, Pat & Chip this would turn out to be a permanent vacation.

LYNZEE (1993-present):

Over the next 2 years Richard kept moving forward asking Michael Mansfield if he were interested in playing bass on some of his musical projects beginning the next phase of Lynzee… The next decade would turn out to be the most prolific and experimental period for Lynzee as Richard & Michael worked through various incarnations of the band, accumulating over 100 songs.

In 2003 a return to the Lynzee “vaults” uncovered a collection of forgotten 8 track & 16 track masters. This reignited the desire to resurrect Lynzee and bring back the classic sound to the masses. Richard repackaged the 1992 album “Man of the People” and compiled the original demos into the album “Lynzee Sessions”. Some of these lost recordings would be remixed & offered on “Victim of Nirvana” as well as the unreleased “Demolition.” These would be released on a Limited run through Darknight Entertainment in 2003. Later that year they would have one of the Lynzee songs picked up for the “Metal Action Vol. 3” compilation release out of France. Lynzee began to garner interest through the internet and was again released on a compilation in 2004 “Crankspiv Records : Volume 8”., followed by “The very Best of Millenium Metal Volume 1 & 2” from Nu-metal Records in 2005.

After one of their impromptu performances in September 2008 & the exit of yet another drummer, Mike created a basic Lynzee Myspace as a small tribute to the band. Richard filled it with everything Lynzee. They had no idea what would come of this little endeavor… By the end of 2008 the band found new life when they were discovered & signed by RETROSPECT RECORDS one the worlds largest independent rock/metal labels.

SO… Its OFFICIAL Lynzee will be Releasing AT LEAST FOUR albums through RETROSPECT RECORDS www.retrospectrecords.com in 2010. 1st The ULTRA Rare: Victim of Nirvana from 1989-90, 2nd Man of the People from 1992-90.
