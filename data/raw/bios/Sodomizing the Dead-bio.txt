Sodomizing the Dead is a perverse blend of  Brutal Death Metal, Thrash, and Grindcore. This filthy breed of thrash was hatched from the inhumane thoughts of Ruben (vocals, guitar), Juan (bass R.I.P), and Jimmy (drums). Together they sodomize and smother your ears with a relentless assault of noise.

Current Lineup:
Eddie - Vocals/Guitars
Sal - Bass, Vocals (Execution (US), Fueled by Fire)
Ruben - Drums, Vocals <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sodomizing+the+dead">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
