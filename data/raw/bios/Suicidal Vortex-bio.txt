Suicidal Vortex is a side project (just a band) from Terminal Spirit member EXORD and ex-member (from the SEELENTANZ era) DIS-CONNECTED-MESSIAH, born under the smashing sky autumn 2004.
SUICIDAL VORTEX IS AN ADOGMATIC LEFT FASCISTS INTERESTED IN PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS OF THE HUMAN BRAIN, ESPECIALLY THE STATE OF DEPRESSION WITH REGARD TO SUICIDAL TENDENCIES HENCE, FOR THOSE WHO DO NOT OR DO NOT WANT TO UNDERSTAND, WE DO NOT SUPPORT ANY POLITICS NOR DO WE ADAPT TO ANY DOGMATIC PHILOSOPHY SINCE WE ARE, AS MENTIONED ABOVE, ADOGMATIC.
Suicidal Vortex luckily don't play cliche-bedroom-bm as one might fear from the name. Instead they play a kind of black metal that reminds of modern US-based acts such as Leviathan. This means a cold, almost industrial atmosphere with cutting guitar riffs and pounding programmed drums.

Suicidal Vortex was born under the crushing sky during the springtime months anno 2003! Firstly a project, now a noise combo to washing out our mental gashes! Exord and the Dis-Conntected-Messiah played at the past-time guitars in the seriously avantgarde band >Seelentanz< (now Terminal Spirit!!!). We are: Exord (musick and machinery, Terminal Spirit) D.C.Messiah (lyrics and propaganda, ex-Storm Warrior and Seelentanz) Now, the man on the bassguitar >Worona< (a brother from Terminal Spirit).  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Suicidal+Vortex">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
