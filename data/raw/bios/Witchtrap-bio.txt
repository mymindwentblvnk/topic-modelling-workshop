They performed roughly hundred concerts and changed 36 group members in ten years. The band's lyrics were about witchcraft, satanism and eastern mysticism. Eventually, their concerts turned into underground satanic gatherings and sadomasochistic stage shows. The band’s most known line-up consisted of Tolgahan on vocals, Kara Leke on drums, İhsan on bass guitar, Ufuk on guitars, and Katana on guitars & back vocal.

The band released two demos; The Witch in 1992, and Incubbo Sucubbo in 1993. Turkish metal label Hammer Müzik released their first and last album Witching Black in 1997. After a while Witchcraft disbanded and Tolgahan founded Sadistic Spell with Kara Leke.
