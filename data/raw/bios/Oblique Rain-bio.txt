Oblique Rain came to life in 2004 in the city of Porto. The will and good taste of two old friends, Flávio Silva and César Teixeira, made them start an unusual project for the Portuguese underground scene. 
They were joined by Daniel Botelho and André Ribeiro. Daniel Botelho has since been replaced, and so, to the line-up were added the musicians Guilherme Lapa and Daniel Cardoso (Head Control System).
Isohyet, their debut album, was released in September 2007.
