Venomous Breath was raised in the year of 2011, in Campina Grande (city in the state of Paraíba, Brazil) with the purpose to evoke the message eternalized by old demons. Fast tempos, morbid passages and low tunings are some of the elements that compose the work of these four adepts devoted to the timeless magic of the Old Metal of Death.

Lyrics depict personal themes, passing through psychological terror, existentialism and the death of god. Everything is mixed to a dense and profound atmosphere; without giving up the melodies and speediness common to the genre.

With a self-released demo and numerous live gigs along with bands such as Warhammer, Apokalyptic Raids and Sodomizer, the band is ready to release its first official album. Besides, a promotional version of the debut shall be launched, bringing 3 out of the 8 songs that will figure in the album.
