Deadly Carnage born in late 2005 by will of Adres (bass) and Marco (drums); within some months Nicholas (guitar) and Marcello (vocals) join the band: that line-up releases the first demo sessions “Noise Of War, Noise Of Doom” (2006) and “Sentiero I” EP (2007). After the early recordings, Deadly Carnage leave the classic black metal sound to embrace more atmospheric and doom influences. By this change, the band releases the debut full-length “Decadenza”, first auto-product then re-released by Dark Babel Records. Afterwards, Nicholas leaves the band, replaced by Dave and Alexios. The new and still working line-up brings a new range of influences, and after about two years of hard work the band signs for ATMF label and release two albums: “Sentiero II: Ceneri” in 2011 and “Manthe” in 2014.
