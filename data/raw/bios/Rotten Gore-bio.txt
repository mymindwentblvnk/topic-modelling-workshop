Rotten Gore is a goregrind-duo emerging from Helsinki, Finland. It's bowel-gurgling sound has been influenced by such great bands as early Carcass, Cock and Ball Torture, Sikfuk, all Disgorges and Fall Out Boy. At the moment, the band consists of two deathful musicians, Sir Gut Violator (infinitely torturous voice of hell's deepest chambers) and BowelBurner (Axe of pain and evil drum-programming from hell). The band is known for it's awesomely crushing heavyness and so fast drumming, that they have to use a computer as a drum machine. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rotten+Gore">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
