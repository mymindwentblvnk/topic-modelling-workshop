2) Kult is raw black metal band conceived in Italy in 2002 by Werewolf (Bloodtide) and Kacele. The band had tired of the new wave of symphonic black metal and wanted to play raw Black Metal without female vocals and keyboards. During 2003, they took part in two concerts in Italy and Switzerland with two other bands. At the end of that year, French label Ewiger Hass Productions printed KULT’s first and only demo tape ‘Darkness Return’, which received an enthusiastic response and sold out within three months. In 2004, Kacele joined the band Arvind as a session member and a few months later Bloodtide (Werewolf) and some others founded a Thrash Metal band in the vein of Sarcofago/Protector etc., called Executioner. After airing their new songs in the live arena, KULT recorded their debut album ‘Winds of War’ in 2006 at Alpha Omega Studio (Mortuary Drape/Ancient), where they mixed, mastered and recorded all instruments themselves (except the guitars, which were recorded by Aphazel of Ancient). ‘Winds of War’ is out now on Debemur Morti Productions.
