Lycosa hailing from Richmond, Virginia burst onto the scene of the mid-90's grindcore/powerviolence underground circuit. 

Borrowing heavily from West Coast power-violence pioneers such as Spazz and The Locust, Lycosa brandished their own unique stygian strain of punk, power-violence, hip-hop, tech-grind and death/black-metal, which would eventualy help lay the groundwork for the neo-thrash movement.

Final line-up:
briÃ«n white: guitar/vocals
drashon young: guitar/vocals
howdy: bass/vocals
barry lutz: drums/vocals

Although the band is currently inactive, you can find some new material on their myspace.com music page.
