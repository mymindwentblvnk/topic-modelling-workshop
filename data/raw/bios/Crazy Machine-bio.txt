“Words Are Seldom Projections Of Your Lies”

From “ The End Of The Universe” Lyrics © 2006 Stephen Burgess

Once in a blue moon, four young men will meet and put together their collective souls and aspirations and embark on a journey unlike any which has been embarked upon before. This is evidently true with the four rough-and-tumble rockers who comprise Crazy Machine.

Stephen Burgess (guitar and vocals) and Aapo Salo (guitar) met Tuomas Kraft (drums) through an ad in the online musician community. With various bass players filling in during gigs, the group laid down as a 3-piece what would become their first release: the EP “Meet The Machine” in 2006.

Lead-off track “The End Of The Universe” proved to be a number worth reckoning with, as it shot to # 25 in the digital metal charts in it's second week of release. The band slowly began building a universal fanbase, with the most hardcore supporters attending each gig.

Gaining further notoriety on the club circuit with their intense fan-friendly live shows, and with conservative groups for the provocative track “Räkäkulli”, the group officially became a four-piece with the arrival of Tuomas Hämäläinen on bass guitar.

Having conquered the Helsinki club scene in 2006 with the intricacies, moshing and hooks particular only to them, Crazy Machine are currently in studio mode, ready to begin treading international soil by the end of 2007.
