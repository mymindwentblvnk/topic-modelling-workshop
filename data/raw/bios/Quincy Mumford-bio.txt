In 2008, he released his first full-length album to great acclaim, earning him three Asbury Music Awards nominations, a coveted place in WBJB 90.5 The Night’s Emerging Artists Concert Series, the #11 spot on 90.5 The Night’s “Top 90 Albums Released in 2008,” and entry at #103 on the “Top 200 Songs on Non-Commercial Triple A Radio” chart, from where it’s been steadily climbing ever since. Influenced by such high-talent, laid-back contemporary artists as Jack Johnson and John Mayer, Quincy is a self-described “down-to-earth, happy, and creative guy focused on his career” who finds inspiration for his meaningful lyrics in the real-world people and places that inhabit his small-town daily life. Take “My Town,” an homage to his native Allenhurst, NJ, from his self-titled debut, or “Helmet Man,” a track on his upcoming second CD about the ubiquitous old guy who rides around town on his bike — both are quintessentially Quincy, colorful cuts of unassuming life, marbled with intense flavor but served up richly mellow with a mature sensibility that belies the writer’s young age.

Whether he’s raising awareness of environmental issues like beach preservation, raising funds for charitable causes that inform his worldview, or raising the spirits of audiences young and old at a benefit concert to feed the homeless, Quincy’s the real deal — actually living the life he sings about, like his regular Friday-night jam sessions on the beach at surf camps for kids or his foray with the Sons of Ireland Polar Bear Plunge to promote clean ocean action. Quincy’s music is kind of like Quincy himself — subtle but strong. Before you know it, your feet are tapping and your heart is smiling, having been transported to that soothing, uplifting place Quincy Mumford aims to take listeners on every song he writes. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Quincy+Mumford">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
