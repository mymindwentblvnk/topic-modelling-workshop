Spanish band of the early 90s which plays a great and very dark Death Metal adorned with brilliant keyboards and a huge demoniac feeling. Fernando, the singer, also plays in Heavenshore and the more known goregrind band Haemorrage. They released a demo called  "In Nomine Domini Nostri, Jesus Christi" in 1993. Sadly they disbanded later and we can only enjoy this great material from a band which could have been a brutal impact for the scene. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lugubrious">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
