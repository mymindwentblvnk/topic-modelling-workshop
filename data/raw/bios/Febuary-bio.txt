Febuary is an artist-producer of Congolese descent who’s sound fuses confessional Alternative R&B with brushes of Afrobeat textures - a contemporary union of African heritage and modern culture accredited to his mixed upbringing. Herein lies Febuary’s appeal, as he narrates introspective lyrics over a bed of warm intimate production, his music plays like a soundtrack to late night reflections & summer heartbreaks. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Febuary">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
