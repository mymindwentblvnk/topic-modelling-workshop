WILDEORNES.(c) ..........Conceptually formed in 2009, WILDEORNES (pronounced wilderness) has been working on a full length CD for the last 12 months. When Downriver ceased to exist it allowed Wildeornes to expand and for Damo and Richy to dig deeper into their background of metal and other forms of progressive and heavy music. The CD is being recorded by Jarrod Ferguson, all drums and bass were played by Richy, with guitar and vocals shared by Richy and Damo. In true metal tradition the twin guitar assault remains intact! Onj (W.A.R., Constraint, Brand X) was the original live bass player but due to various commitments of various members the live line-up is now complete with Hoffy (Lie & Wait) on bass guitar and Tom (Greenfiend) on drums, Damo and Richy are able to utilise their love and involvement in the Australian underground music scene (16 years each with bands between them including Peanut, W.A.R.-Without A Reason, Doom Town Intensive, Bongmoth, Downriver) and are soon to start gigging. . . weshalwildeornes@gmail.com

The cumulative result of a myriad of influences. Music as an end in itself with enough lyrical irony to never take itself too seriously. An attempt to incorporate old and new influences without actually sounding like anything other than Wildeornes. Post-structuralist heavy metal for the noble savage.
