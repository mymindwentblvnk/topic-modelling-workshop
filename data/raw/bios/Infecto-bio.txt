Infecto is a band hailing from Buenos Aires, Argentina. It consists of El Turko (vocals), Rubi (guitars & backing vocals), Pablo (bass & backing vocals) and Martin (drums & percussion).

It all began around September 2010 when El Turko - after leaving Faxion, his former band - decides to become a vocalist and start a new project. The first person to join him was an old friend from the neighborhood and a vocalist as well, Matt Zarabozo. Together they would take care of the vocals, so they started looking for other musicians. That's when El Turko gets in touch with Rubi, who used to play in a band called Hunter-Killer with an old friend of El Turko's. 

With vocals and guitars aboard, Rubi got in touch with Martin - with whom he'd shared a live performance when the latter was the drummer for a band called Revuelta Emergente - and Eugenia, who would be in charge of playing the bass.

They began rehearsing and eventually Matt left the band due to musical differences. A few months after that, Eugenia was dissociated from the band.

After holding a few auditions for bass players, Pablo - Martin's cousin - joined the band.

Initially they were supposed to be called Primitivo, but due to some inconveniences when registering it, it was decided that they would take the name INFECTO. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Infecto">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
