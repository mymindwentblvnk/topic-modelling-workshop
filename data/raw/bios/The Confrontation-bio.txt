In 2004 On Broken Wings, a band from Boston, Ma. started a side project called Confrontation. Between tours Kevin, Burke, and Jerome would play local shows with singer Eric D., and Brendan Conners. Confrontation began picking up the attention of the local music scene and Boston area label, Rock Vegas Records. In 2006 they released their debut album "Famous Last Words" on Rock Vegas. On Broken Wings continued touring until breaking up in 2008. With years of touring experience both stateside and internationally, the urge to continue on the road with Confrontation was lingering. They reentered the studio to record three new songs to put into the set list. Lately Confrontation has been destroying every show they play and rapidly mulitplying their audience. They have shared the stage with Terror, Set Your Goals, The Warriors, 100 Demons, Guns Up, and countless others. In April of 2011 Confrontation had the honor of playing the New England Hardcore and Metal Fest with Biohazard and Blood for Blood and many more. Their main goal is to keep heavy music and hardcore the way they remember it, angry, aggressive, and full of emotion. 

"We are on a mission to go against the grain of the new "metalcore" that consists of eyeliner, tongue in cheek song titles, and emo crossover, Confrontation is here to put pissed off fury back on the map, tour the world, and keep what we love alive." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Confrontation">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
