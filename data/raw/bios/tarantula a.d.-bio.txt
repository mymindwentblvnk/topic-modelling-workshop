Tarantula A.D. was an American progressive rock trio that released their only album, Book of Sand, in 2005. After breaking up not long after the release of the album, they reunited with an evolved sound as Priestbird.

Members of Tarantula A.D. were Danny Bensi (Cello, Violin, Piano, Vocals), Saunder Jurriaans (Guitar, Bass, Vocals), and Gregory Rogove (Drums, Percussion, Piano, Melodica, Glockenspiel, Vocals). Blending classical arrangements with elements of punk and metal, Tarantula A.D. delivered a hypnotic prog-rock sound with an ambient atmosphere. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tarantula+A.D.">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
