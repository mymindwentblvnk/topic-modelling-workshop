Back in 2005 Eli Prinsen (former vocalist of Sealed Fate and Sceptre) met Johnny Bowden (Guitarist of The Undisputed). Although the two came from very different backgrounds musically, they shared a love for Jesus Christ as well as many similar musical interests. The two set out to fuse together Eli's classic/power metal vocal style along with Johnny's driving punk/metal guitar style to create a modern style of metal with a strong classic power metal feel...What resulted was what is now known to Christian metal fans as "The Sacrificed".

The Sacrificed independently released their 1st demo album entitled: "The Da Vinci Hoax" on March 17th, 2007 then in July of 2007, they added drummer Jay Williams (Fortress, Electric Warfare) to the line-up. Signed by Roxx Records in November of 2009, The Sacrificed released it's 1st full-length album entitled: "2012" with a heavier and more "power-metalish" vibe than "The Da Vinci Hoax", gaining a larger fan base and reaching a broader audience.

In October of 2010 vocalist Eli Prinsen was asked to fill in for Jimmy P. Brown of the legendary Christian metal band "Deliverance" and front the band as they headlined NORDIC FEST 2010 in Oslo, Norway. It was an incredible experience and many lasting friendships were forged, and as The Sacrificed now writes and records their 3rd album, they have added 2 new members... Mike Phillips (Lead guitarist of Deliverance/Fasedown), and Bassist, Daniel Cordova (formerly of Vengeance Rising), as well as a very special guest appearance by Roy Z (Halford, Dickenson, Rob Rock). The Sacrificed have signed once again with ROXX Records for their upcoming release III slated for January 31st 2012! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Sacrificed">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
