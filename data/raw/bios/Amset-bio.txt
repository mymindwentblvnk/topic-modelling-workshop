Amset is a Spanish music group which plays a kind of Hard Rock with gothic highlights, heavy guitars and a dense atmosphears. Their musical influences move around the whole Rock, from Hard Rock to Industrial, Alternative, Heavy Metal...

We could say that Amset have four pillars, which are Rob Zombie, Rammstein, W.A.S.P. and Alice Cooper.

They began to play in 2000, and from the very first moment they decided that they wanted to offer something more than music in concerts, it is vital for them to represent in the stage what they do.

Current Line up:
Richy (voice)
Filtho (keyboards)
Javi (bass)
Manu (drums)
Junior (guitar)
