After a long journey and a successful onstage career, TristMoon has now moved to the next level: recording their first album. The recording process started in 2008 and is coming to an end, after which the long awaited album will be available on the market. TristMoon fans are no strangers to the melodies and lyrics that will be on the album, but they will be in for a surprise when they hear their favorite songs mixed and mastered.

TristMoon’s members work together to come up with the melodies and lyrics for their songs. Adel, the band’s keys/synths and main composer, along with Serge, the band’s lead guitarist, are responsible for creating the melodies of the band. Inspired by the dark melodies, Sako the band’s vocalist, then composes the lyrics to go along with the songs. The band then gets together to refine the songs with Tony’s huge variety of speed drumming and filling, and Gary’s contributions on the bass guitar. The result is a Black Melodic style that permeates the mood of TristMoon.

TristMoon have been part of the Lebanese metal scene since 2006, when they performed live for the first time at Discordance, Furn el Chebbak. Since then the band has played live in around 10 different events, such as gigs, festivals, and concerts, in several locations around the country, the latest of which was Summer Fusion after which the band went behind the scenes to focus on the upcoming album’s production.

The album has been TristMoon’s goal and aim from the moment the band was born. With the help of the dedicated fans that have always stood by TristMoon and its music, this dream is finally becoming a reality. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/TristMoon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
