Before The Dawn was a Melodic Death/Gothic Metal band that saw daylight in 1999 as a solo project by Tuomas Saukkonen. The first line-up was gathered so that the band would be able to perform live. With many changes inside the band, they entered the studio to record an MCD called Gehenna. After two albums (My Darkness and 4.17 am) and numerous changes in the line-up, Tuomas gathered an entirely new line-up in 2005 and went on to record the album The Ghost. The songs that didn't fit on this album were released on Tuomas' other project Dawn of Solace.
From their 2007 album, Deadlight, the song Deadsong was accompanied with a video.

In 2011, their 6th album Deathstar Rising was released at Nuclear Blast.
