There are six artists with the name Release.

1. Hardcore Band from Edison, New Jersey United States (1988-1990) Band Members: Rob Fish : Vocals, Chris Zusi : Guitar, Greg Shafer : Bass, Chris Caponegro : Drums, Joe Coia : Guitar

2. Groove/Thrash Metal band from San Francisco, California. Formed in 1994. The band is split up. Band Members: Aaron Zimpel - Vocals, Guitar (Metal Church, Anvil Chorus), Gary Wendt - Guitar (Sacrilege B.C., Skinlab), Nathan Harlow - Bass, Steve Kilgore - Drums. Released one album entitled "End of the Light" in 1995 on Century Media records. It's sound is typical 90's post-thrash metal, although slower and more atmospheric with less emphasis on stop-start rythms as more popular 90's metal/groove bands such as Pantera, Machine Head, and Fear Factory. Has the gloom of Alice in Chains with a mature, slamming approach and delivery that did not appeal enough to the younger crowd and did not sell well.
