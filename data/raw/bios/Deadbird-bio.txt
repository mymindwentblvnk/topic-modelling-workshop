Deadbird came into being in 2002 when Chuck Schaaf left Little Rock's Rwake and moved to Fayetteville, forming Deadbird with his brother Phillip. Codebreaker picked up the first record in Europe, licensing all of their releases to Earache in the UK. A few tours followed. Alan left for his family. Jay joined and filled the gap. Two tours later, Todd left. Now Reid, once a member of Rwake, has joined. Alan has since rejoined the band as a third guitarist.
