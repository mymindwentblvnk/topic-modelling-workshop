 The band originally started as a bedroom project between guitarist Daniel Russell and former keyboard player Alan Woodham back in 2007 but has since grown to become a complete unit with an ever growing fan base around the world.

 In summer 2008 guitarist Stephen Traut joined the band and after Alan’s departure in 2009 the band moved their base to the Newcastle area to continue the search for members. It was at this time the band released their ‘Abstract Connections’ demo to a strong response, with subsequent features on BBC radio and positive reviews from the metal community.

 John Dalziel was welcomed to the band in 2009 on keyboards and after some member shuffling throughout 2010 in the summer of 2011 the band was strengthened by bassist James Carter and vocalist Liam Posselwhite. 

 On 25th of November 2011 Midnight Realm released for free download their first full track entitled ‘Solaris’. The record, which was self produced and mixed by Matt Crawford @ Numbskull Audio (www.numbskullaudio.com) features drummer Alex Rüdinger (Threat Signal, Ordinance) who completed the drums for the bands debut EP ‘Polarissima’ due for release in early 2012.

 The band are currently taking bookings for live shows in the summer of 2012 and are busy writing their first full length album.
