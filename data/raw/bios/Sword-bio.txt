Sword is a Canadian heavy metal band that was active in the 1980s and announced a reunion in 2011.
In the early 80's, south of Montréal in Saint Bruno, Quebec, Rick (vocals) and Dan Hughes (drums) formed a heavy metal band called Sword. They were joined by guitarist Mike Plant and bassist Mike Larocque in the first lineup of the band. They signed their first commercial contract in 1984 with Aquarius Records.
Sword released two albums for Aquarius Records -  the debut album Metalized in 1986 and its follow-up Sweet Dreams in 1988. They toured in the support slot for Motörhead, Alice Cooper and Metal Church, and the group was hand-picked to open for Metallica on the 1986 Master of Puppets tour.
After disbanding, Rick Hughes formed Saints & Sinners and released a self-titled album with them.
In 2006, Aquarius Records released a compilation album The Best of Sword, which was in stores on Tuesday, October 31.
Throughout their career, Sword sold in excess of 180,000 albums.
On February 17, 2011 it was announced that Sword had reunited and were rehearsing for live shows to come.
The band is currently working on the material for their new album.
