There are 6 bands known as Sacrilegium:

1. One of the most charismatic and yet unnoted Black Metal bands in Poland, Sacrilegium was formed in early 1993. Since their formation the two original members - Nantur Aldaron (bass, vocals) and Succlagus (vocals, guitar, keyboards) worked with many different drummers. 
Sacrilegium's first demo "Sleeptime" helped to build an underground base and was followed by album "Wicher" ("Stormwind') in 1996. 

Influenced by different Black Metal styles, from Greek and Norwegian streams to old school bands, Sacrilegium mold their own style of atmosphere and melancholy ridden, yet violent and hateful music with tasteful use of keyboards. Lyrics that are written and sung in their native language speak mostly about paganism, their slavonic ancestors, beauty of wild nature, but also about grim, cold and dark topics like vampirism... 

After the release of "Wicher" the band recorded two demo tapes 'Recidivus' (1998) and 'Embrace the Darkness' (1999),the latter of which appearing on a compilation album including the 'Sleeptime' demo and their track from the Jesienne Szepty split with North. After numerous line-up changes and problems the band ceased in late 2000. 

Drudkh covered "Tam Gdzie Gasnie Dzien" (from "Jesienne Szepty"), on "Slavonic Chronicles" (2010), and "Recidivus" (from "Recidivus") on "Thousands of Moons Ago / The Gates" (split w/ Winterfylleth 2014)
Slavland covered "Wicher falami ognia" (from "Wicher"), on "Pieśń gromu" (2002).
