Montreal-based visual artist and musician Ali Levy started her musical career when she began playing double bass in high school. She went on to attend the Berklee Five-Week Summer Performance Program (with Adrianne Lenker of Big Thief as a fellow student), and eventually earned a full scholarship to study jazz bass at The New School. Since graduating in 2015, Levy has been playing as Ada Lea. She released the four-song EP (Sainte Cecile) in 2016, followed by the demo album, Bored (Records DK, 2017), featuring 11 appropriately rough yet dreamy songs weaving in and out of apathy, hurling anger, and a craving for satisfaction. She's now signed to Saddle Creek Records.

Ada Leaâ€™s current line-up includes Harris Shper (keyboard/vocals), Matt Rousseau (bass), and Evan Tighe (drums) who accompany Levy on her sometimes soft, sometimes emphatic guitar-driven songs. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ada+Lea">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
