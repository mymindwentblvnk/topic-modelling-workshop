Started playing with the current line up in 2002 getting together members from two different metal-influenced hard core bands: Albi, Ivo and Ivan from Slapsticks  (R.I.P.) Tommy and Nicolas from To Die For (R.I.P.) During the life of the two bands all the members of the current Slowmotion Apocalypse's line up experienced a lot of live activity as headliners or guests of many bands: Graveworm, The Great Deceiver, Converge, Nine, Raised Fist, Stormwitch, Ektomorf, Evenfall, Mandragora Scream, Rage, Linea 77, etc. With superb production by Riccardo "Paso" Pasini (Ephel Duath, Reprisal & The Secret), they now released their debut album “My Own Private Armageddon” on the USA label Tribunal Records (Atreyu, Killwhitneydead, Deadsoil). This is the beginning of the Apocalypse. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Slowmotion+Apocalypse">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
