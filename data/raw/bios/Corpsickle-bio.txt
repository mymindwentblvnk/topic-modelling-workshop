Corpsickle was summoned from the ground by meddling occultists at the turn of the millenium. The unimpressed summoned fiends, the zombie of necrophilia and corpsemaster general immediately slew these panda worshipping occultists and enlisted the services of the master of maggot mayhem and unleashed 2 demos of zombified death metal, Eaters of Pus in 2000 and Violating the Dead in 2001. After the second release the fiends returned to their previous antics, ZON started making sweet love to the dead, CMG slayed poofters and defiled virgins and MOMM returned to his tomb. The year of 2006 was about to turn and the dead fiends decided to reanimate the stinking cadaver that was corpsickle, recording a new piece of vomit for a split with fellow fiends Roadside Burial, as well as further songs for another split and plans to do a full length full of zombies and gore. The horror continues. In mid 2006 the sickening duo recruited An Inconspicuous Undead Dude on bass, and have recorded their first decrepit panda slaying full length 'Zombie' in 2007, an ode to the most erotic form known to mankind - the walking dead. Many fellow fiends were exhumed to add their filthy vocals on this cheesy slab of erotic rottenness. The Master oF Maggot Mayhem was also by unholy ritual transformed from machine to rotting flesh.
