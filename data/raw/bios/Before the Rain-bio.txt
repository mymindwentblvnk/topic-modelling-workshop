Before The Rain was first shaped in 1997 in Setúbal, Portugal, when vocalist Carlos D'Agua and guitar player Valter Cunha began to share musical ideas that ended as acoustic songs. As time passed by, the acoustic sounds weren't enough to express the emotions and feelings unleashed by Valter and Carlos, and in 1998 they decided to seek the remaining members for the band. But it wasn't until 2001 that a stable line-up was found: Carlos: voice; Valter: guitar; Tiago Ferreira: guitar; Andre Vasconcelos: bass; Goncalo Brito: drums.

With this line-up, the band recorded two songs in December 2001: "Be Mine" and "You ... My Ruin". This recording was entitled "…and with the day dying light", and was never properly distributed, except for a strict number of individuals, somehow close to the band.

In August 2003 the band records a new song called "The Swansong". At this stage, Tiago and Andre are no longer in the line-up and Hugo Santos joins the fold as new guitar player. Shortly after "The Swansong" studio session, the band parts ways with drummer Goncalo Brito. Then came long time friend and gifted bass player Pedro Daniel and drummer Goncalo Correia to complete what's the strongest line-up to date. The band then enters studio to record what will turn out to be their debut album, entitled "One Day Less". 

The album "One Day Less" is out on July 30th 2007 through Major Label Industries

The band is currently writing new material for a new album with the new members Carlos Monteiro (guitar) and K. (drums) <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Before+the+Rain">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
