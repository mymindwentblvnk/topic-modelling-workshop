Woods of Infinity was a black metal band founded in 1999 in Ume√•, Sweden by Melkor and Ravenlord.
They are considered one of the most unique black metal bands, mainly because of the unprecedented lyrics, known for their grave honesty and perverse love for life and all that nature has to offer.
The band split up because the members believed they were moving too far away from the original core of their sound. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Woods+of+Infinity">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
