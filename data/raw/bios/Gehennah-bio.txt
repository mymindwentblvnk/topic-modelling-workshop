Karlstad's retro-Metal act GEHENNAH made their presence known via two now infamous demos 1993's subtly titled 'Kill' and the following year's 'Brilliant Loud Overlords Of Destruction'. The band had emerged as a quartet comprising vocalist Mr. Violence, guitarist Garm Stringburner, bass player Ronnie 'Ripper' Olsson and Captain Cannibal on the drums, this unit starting out as a VENOM covers act. That same year Olsson had issued a demo, 'Grim Clouds', from his solo Black Metal project GRINNING MOON.

During mid 1994 Cannibal opted out, being superseded by Micke Birgersson (a.k.a. 'Hellcop'). A deal with Primitive Art Records was struck for the 'Hardrocker' album, recorded over the Christmas period of 1994. The release party for this album was held at the Shitheads Motorcycle Club in Karlstad. A promotional video for the title track featured various inebriated members of MORTIIS, SWORDMASTER, VOMITORY, NIFELHEIM and NEZGAROTH. GEHENNAH then launched the 'No Fucking Christmas' EP, in a limited run of 500 golden vinyl copies. This opus was cut with producer Living Skull at studio Prima Volta in Forshaga.

During 1995 Rob Stringburner (as 'Rob Coffinshaker') took a musical diversion with his "vampyric Rock n' roll" project THE COFFINSHAKERS debut demo 'Bad Moon Over Transylvania'. This endeavour went on to publish a swathe of recordings in parallel to GEHENNAH, including the 1996 'Dracula Has Risen From The Grave' EP for Primitive Art and 1999 'We Are The Undead' album.

GEHENNAH's next effort 'King Of The Sidewalk', once again recorded at Prima Volta Studios, saw the band signing up to French Black Metal experts Osmose Productions. Although disowned by the band as rushed and under produced the album made sufficient impact to score a European 1996 tour billed alongside IMPALED NAZARENE and ANGELCORPSE. It would later be revealed that Mr. Violence had consumed so much alcohol during these recording sessions that he completely lost his voice. The band had to wait five weeks for him to recover.

With GEHENNAH gaining ground Primitive Art Records reissued both 'Hardrocker' and 'No Fucking Christmas' in vinyl format although only 100 copies of each surfaced. A split EP with RISE AND SHINE was also recorded. Their next Osmose Productions offering would be the 'Decibel Rebel' album, laid down at Sunlight Studios in August of 1997. Erstwhile MERCILESS frontman Rogga Pettersson aided on backing vocals. A split single shared with RISE AND SHINE found GEHENNAH covering the Country staple 'Jackson', this song seeing Mr. Violence duetting with Josabeth Leidi.

Ronnie 'Ripper' Olson also shares his duties with VOMITORY whilst Birgersson operates with Death Metal act DAWN OF DECAY. Members of GEHENNAH contributed to the SATANARCHY band project of 2000 with personnel from RISE AND SHINE and FURBOWL.

Fans lucky enough to attend GEHENNAH's tenth anniversary gig held in Karlstad on 11th of October 2002 would be given a gig single 'Ten Years Of Fucked Up Behaviour'. Limited to just 50 copies the EP comprised tracks from the 'Kill' demo, a new song 'Bleed You Bastards' and a cover version of G.G. ALLIN's 'Drink, Fight And Fuck'.

Rob Stringburner, as ROB COFFINSHAKER, released a brace of solo 7" singles, 'Live At The Cemetery' in 2002 and 'Fairytales From The Dungeon' the following year.
