As a part of the colombian metal scene for some years now, OPENSIGHT changes gradually and constantly, trying to contribute to the metal music environment with an honest and authentic vision of the genre. 

With the objective of creating interesting music, OPENSIGHT takes positive elements of metal and music in general to build songs; getting a strong melodic sense, elaborated contrasts and some emotional qualities as the result, with a lyrical content that deals with human condition and personal reflexion.

PROSTHETIC SOUL
After some years of activity OPENSIGHT presents its debut record under the name of PROSTHETIC SOUL. The start point of a band with an honest and versatile vision of metal music.

The record is conceived as an intention to blend opposite aspects both in musical and lyrical terms. The dissonant and heavy qualities are faced with the melodic and acoustic ones, as the complex ideas are presented in a simple way. The lyrics are abstract, reflecting low emotional periods of life through physical referents such as illness.
PROSTHETIC SOUL is divided in two parts with Splenia, a song that shows the band in what could be called its most melodic and diverse moment. Below animal and Beyond Man are placed one after another, both dealing with the same topic but very different regarding sound and structure. Warning Sign is short and direct as an album opener, which comes to a dramatic end with the last track: Accidental Formula. The songs share topics, they are placed as if PROSTHETIC SOUL was a concept album but it really isn’t.  The proposal of a band that has only one thing clear: The intention to create interesting music.

Opensight’s debut was recorded at Stereo Pig Studios in Bogota-Colombia and mastered by Jim Morris in Morrisound.
