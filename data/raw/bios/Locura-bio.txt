MORE THAN 1 BAND w/ this NAME

LOCURA -- San Francisco Bay Area - http://www.myspace.com/locuramusica 

LOCURA, is an experimental trio based in the SF Bay Area who blends the melodies of Salsa, funk, hip-hop and reggae into their unique sound. 

Vocalist Kata Miletich, uses an amazing vocal range to seductive deliver a powerful humanistic message  using folksy lyrics that flow harmoniously between English and Spanish effortlessly demonstrating the power of bilingual expression.

Guitarist Bob Sanders delicately crafts silky rhythms, with subtle flamenco & reggae inspirations, to enhances the soulful ambience of the powerful vocals

Percussionist Rachel Bouch-D, casually drives the groove that pulses from the relentlessly complex creativity required to design such a vibrant sound dedicated to "bridging cultures, transcending borders... and realizing a life where another world is possible."

LoCura strives to prove that music is Universal language and is at its fullest potential when it can deliver both an immediate emotional response while also inspiring, even demanding, people to participate in creating a profound social/political change.  Animas is their debut album.

I first saw Locura perform in 2006, right after their formation and have watched them continue to grow to the point that they've put out this CD  LoCura deserves to be heard, if for no other reason they remind us that music can be a Universal language and is at its fullest potential when it can deliver both an immediate emotional response while also inspiring, even demanding, people to participate in creating a profound social/political change.
