Berlin's Uwe Zahn released his first tracks as the Arovane EP on the Din label, which also released the first of German dub minimalist Stefan Betke's work as Pole. Stylistically, Arovane's work hearkens back to the insular melodic electro of early Autechre, combining interesting, highly syncopated machine box rhythms with warm, delicate synth textures that evoke a gauzy, somewhat nostalgic mood contrasted by the sharpness of the rhythms. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Arovane">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
