Lawnmower Deth are an English thrash metal band who parodied the genre and recorded three-and-a-half albums. Initially active in the late 1980s and early 1990s, they reformed in 2008. Lawnmower Deth were formed in Ravenshead, Nottinghamshire, England in 1987 by Chris Flint and Joseph Whitaker School mates Pete Lee, Steve Nesfield and Chris Parkes, along with Gavin ‘Paddy’ O’Malley from Colwick, Nottingham.

Their first official release was a split album with Metal Duck. Lawnmower Deth’s side of the record was entitled Mower Liberation Front and positive responses led to their debut studio album, Ooh Crikey, It’s… Lawnmower Deth. Lawnmower Deth’s second studio album, Return of the Fabulous Metal Bozo Clowns, was released in 1992. For this release Paddy was replaced by Kev Papworth.

The band covered several famous songs in their time, including Fleetwood Mac's "The Chain", Motörhead's self-titled song, Squeeze's "Up the Junction", The Osmonds' "Crazy Horses", and Kim Wilde's "Kids in America" which was released as the band's only single in 1991. "Return of the Fabulous Metal Bozo Clowns" was released in 1992. The band's sense of humour extended into their cheap but enjoyable music videos. Both "Kids in America" and "Lawnmowers for Heroes, Comics for Zeros", the latter from Metal Bozo Clowns, were recorded on home video cameras and edited in an amateur fashion.

The band's third and to date latest studio album "Billy" was released in 1993. The band tried to take a slightly different direction on the album, verging towards the kind of pop punk feel pioneered by the likes of Green Day at the time, with most of the band's thrash metal roots left behind. Poor sales and less popular live dates led the band to break up later on that year.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lawnmower+Deth">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
