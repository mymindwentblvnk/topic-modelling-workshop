As a band, Suada has always created and shared stories. Stories to entertain people, but also stories with a philosophical meaning. 
Stories about a girl searching for her light and stories about trolls having a fight at the local bar.

No matter what the stories are about. When Suada is there, free your mind and, for just one moment, believe in your fantasies.
