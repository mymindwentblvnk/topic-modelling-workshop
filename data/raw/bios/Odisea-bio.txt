Odisea is singer Alex Anwandter's first personal project after the definitive disbanding of his band "Teleradio Donoso" in 2009.  Odisea marks the separation between the sound of his former group, towards one particularly marked by the use of machines, synthetizers, and definitely conceived for the dance floor and its trances. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Odisea">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
