Songs about the hopes we cling to and the regrets that cling to us. Rooted in rain-soaked cities and dry mouths, Varnish want to stand by you when the lights go out and occasionally point out the stars.

Varnish are steeped in the influence of dark, jangled pop via post-punk UK music that was dressed to kill and to do it fabulously, as well as "pre-punk" New York City bands that set the stage for the modern and alternative rock scenes that came next. Though not derivative, they were raised on Bowie, sharpened by Siouxsie and the Banshees, and kept awake by Placebo and the Manic Street Preachers. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/varnish">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
