Tenebras Omnia Vincit was a Black Metal band from Norway, Oslo, which formed in 1995.

During their very short lifespan they self-released a single demo, "Hostility, Violence, Imagination". However, it was later bootlegged by Impure Creations Records without the bands approval. The notable difference between the original demo and bootleg is the red cover, whereas the original was white. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tenebras+Omnia+Vincit">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
