Symbyosis is a progressive/technical death metal band from France. It was first intended to be a project named Chrysalid but in June 1998, with the arrival of Phil Quist on additional composition and Corrosive Bob on vocals, the composition becomes faster and a demo is ended up growing rich by new titles. At the end of a long year, it is finally a complete album which also gives way to the re-naming of the band as Symbyosis in June 1999. The album's name was "Crisis".

To make it sound better, the band calls some friends, as Oslanon Gerom on backing vocals, Karl on lead guitar and Cryopsis Entity on lyrics and backing vocals. In March, the single The quest of the dolphin appears on the Metallian magazine compilation. In July 2000 the band signs a contract with Listenable Records. In September, the miniLP The Fluid is out, followed by the full album Crisis in November 2000.

In 2005, with the same line-up, Symbyosis released their second masterpiece "On the wings of Phoenix", an album which is an out-of-ordinary example of technical death metal with its excellent compositional style and instrumentation.

the current line-up is;

Corrosive Bob (Arnaud Chipouka) - Vocals 
Franck Kobolt - Guitars  
Nikos Kevorkian - Guitars  
Antoine Veidt - Bass  
Tarik Zulficar - Drums
