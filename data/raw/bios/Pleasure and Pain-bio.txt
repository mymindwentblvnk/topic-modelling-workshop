Paolo Cataldi (voice) Gianluca Bellincampi (synth) met in Rome in November 1997, since then Pleasure and Pain started an intense creative period in studios. After 8 months the band arranged some songs that gave the possibility, to perform various live concerts in underground clubs of Rome. P&P continued working hard in studios and on January 2001 they released the first Demo-CD, Indelible. The demo is the re-arrangement of old and new songs, mixing dark-wave music with electronic sounds. The good success among the public and enthusiastic reviews allowed the band to play many gigs around Italy, and to appear in various Compilations (Decadance Compilation Vol.1, Rosa Selvaggia Atto III). On February 2003 Pleasure and Pain recorded their 2nd Demo-CD, Naked Blood, which contains 5 new demos tracks and in the year 2004 the band signed with the label DreamCell11 Entertainment, the gothic division of Aural Music, to produce their first official album “Exit Gate” distribuited worldwide by Audioglobe and SPV. 
Ascension Magazine wrote: The best italian darkwave band of the moment! 
Side-line:This is an album full of nostalgia and a real enjoyable listening as well! 

- Vampiria Mag. It is Dark Wave in The Cure style with references to the whole Electronic Dark scene of the 80' with influences that start from Bauhaus, Depeche Mode to arrive to the German more underground Electronic scene. It is a release that is played with amazing atmospheres and that is surely well-played and arranged. I like a lot their way to blend these influences and a mention has to be done for the quality of the singer, with a very deep voice. Good indeed!’
