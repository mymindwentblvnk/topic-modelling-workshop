Hailing from Texas, artist and label owner of up & coming electronic and hip hop label Exponential Records, Ernest Gonzales has steadily seen his sound evolve from the adventurous worlds of experimental hip hop to the new plateaus of electronic lullabies. With this release, Gonzales adds layers of live guitar, allowing more musical influences to successfully coexist. A stuttering mix of drums & down south beats layers with 8 bit electronic bleeps, dreamy guitars, and dirty bass, his melting pot mix can be only be called Down-South-Nintendo-Rock-Tronica. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ernest+Gonzales">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
