"A tasty platter for anyone who is still foolish enough to think that raucous noisy distorted punk is solely the domain of humans born with cocks. "Puke" is the winning track, though the combination of raw Scandi-core, determined midwest punk and UK82 beats works perfectly throughout these seven songs. Dig the hollow and fierce sounding bass, and an urgency in the vocals that owes debts of inspiration to more personal genres far removed from this glorious noise. These Minneapolis women fukkn slay, and make me bummed that we decided to route our March tour away from Minneapolis....shit."
