On top of the Appalachian Mountains in a small Virginia town called Front Royal, Brian, Rob, and Dale joined forces in 2005 and started a punk band. Calling themselves, Kill the Car and not being able to escape their high school and responsibilities they started writing songs and unleashing tales thru their own eyes of the people in peril and the crazy world around them. Over the years, Kill the Car has released 3 demo CDs in hopes to make people feel good about themselves, have played with punk bands such as Daycare Swindlers, Common Enemy, Stuck Lucky, Static Radio, Mischief Brew, The Twats, and Two Man Advantage, and have played whenever and where ever possible giving many good times to all that have participated.

In 2009, from the top of the tallest mountains on the East Coast they finished recording a punk rock vision of insanity. They then teamed up with Overdose On Records and DRP Records, in 2010, to release this album to the masses. “Dead Inspection” will be available on May 4th, 2010 thru MVD Distribution. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kill+The+Car">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
