A Swedish death metal band from Luleå. They released two demo tapes in the early 90s before splitting up. The members went on to form (or join) bands such as Helltrain, The Moaning, Gates Of Ishtar, The Everdawn and Scheitan.

The first demo released in March 1993 "Lucichrist - The Third God" had a slightly blackened edge to its death metal and blasphemous/occult lyrical concepts. Promo 1994 ,which was to be the last release, was also strongly influenced by both the black metal sound and the Swedish melodic death metal contemporaries.

Line-up before split-up:
Pierre Törnkvist - guitar/voice
Niklas Svensson - bass
Robert Fors - keyboard <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Decortication">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
