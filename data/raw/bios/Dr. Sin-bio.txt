Dr. Sin is a Hard Rock / Heavy Metal formed in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil in the year 1991 by Andria Busic (bass/vocals), Ivan Busic (drums/backing vocals) and one of the most talented guitar players in Brazil, Eduardo Ardanuy.
The only change in the band's lineup was the addition of the American vocalist Michael Vescera (Loudness, Yngwie Malmsteen) in the Dr. Sin II times (2000). Vescera only remained in the band for a short time as he soon left the band to start his own solo project.
The band has released a total of 10 albums, including American/Japanese/European versions and singles. They released Listen to the Doctors, in 2005, an album that contains only covers songs with the word "Doctor" in their titles. In 2007, the band released Bravo, after almost seven years without any new songs released.
