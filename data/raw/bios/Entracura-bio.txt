Entracura is a relatively new 5-piece metal band from Hong Kong. Only formed near the beginning of this school year (late 2005). They all went to the same dreadful school at one point (West Island) which is how they all met.

Jeff, Sean and Jeremy were in a band you might have heard of before called Chain of Shadows, but because of whatever reasons, the band no longer exists. So, they joined Matt and Gabe which formed what we know today as Entracura.

They just finished recording their demo, 'In The Face of Hatred' (which is up on here so give it a listen if you have the time).

Entracura are happy to play anywhere so if you want them to play just ask. Hope you enjoy the music and watch this space for more to come in the near future...
