The band was estabilished in 2005. august in Mezobereny. At first the four-member band (2 guitars, drum, vocal) played Metallica, Iron Maiden, Megadeth, Slayer, Mot√∂rhead covers in the trial room, then in 2006 April 8th had came the moment when they had their first concert in the 68's club in Bekescsaba, where they played tracks from the mentioned bands and from a lot of other famous bands for example: Amon Amarth, In Flames and Satyricon.


After this concert there was a change in the guitar post, so started a new era in the band's life. Because of the changing, in the person of Csaba Fekete, had arrived the main componer of the songs, and then he started to write own songs to the band.

That time the band composition was that: Nora Cser-keyboard, Attila Gschwindt-drum, Attila Simon-bass guitar, Tamas Schupkegel - vocal, Csaba Fekete-guitar, Norbert Cser- guitar.

With this new composition there were lots of trials and concerts ( Bekescsaba, Oroshaza, Gyoma, Szarvas, Mezotur, Gyula, Szeged, etc..), then after this period the band went to record their demo, which has the title of Promising Redemption. It got such a enthusiastic response from different medias. In the summer of 2007 became another change in the position of the band. Norbert Cser guitarist signed out and now Mate Lorincz ruled one of the guitar posts. Now here is the band's story and we hope that more people would know and love the Mors Silens' name and music!
