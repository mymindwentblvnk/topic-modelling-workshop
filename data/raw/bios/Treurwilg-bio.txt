From the depressive depths of Tilburg (NL) comes Treurwilg. A massive two-guitar attack of sadness, with haunting soundscapes and rumbling vocals, destined to drag even the happiest soul down to hell. Treurwilg is here to remind you that the world is not a happy place. For fans of Amenra, Ahab, Swallow The Sun, and (early) Katatonia.

On January 29, 2016 they've released their first Live album, recorded at a show in the Little Devil in their hometown Tilburg.
Following was a first studio record that was released the 31th of October 2016. The title of this record is Departure and with this, the band is ready to crush some stages.
