Their signature sound can be found in their simple, yet layered approach to songwriting. Their songs distill a narrative-based song structure system, distinctive melodies and shifting dynamics. They list bands such as Drive Like Jehu, Nirvana, Don Caballero, Fugazi, Hum, Shellac and Slint as their main influences.

GODDARD has been playing since the 2010. On tour, they have played on bills that also boasted the likes of Sonic Youthâ€™s Thurston Moore, J. Mascis of Dinosaur Jr. as well as Giraffes? Giraffes! and Kayo Dot.  They are also featured in the soon to be released DIT documentary telling the story of the DIY/DIT movement in music throughout the world.    www.doittogether.us <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Goddard">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
