Sweden's Nefandus was founded as a satanic Black Metal band in 1993 by Belfagor, Ushatar and Blackwinged. Today, almost two decades later the band is still active as a duo (Ushatar & Belfagor) with principally the same agenda as in the beginning: to spread the Light of Lucifer and the satanic legacy that has been chosen to the band by the gods and goddesses of Sitra Ahra. The band released a demo tape entitled "Behold the Hordes" in 1995, when they had chosen the name Nefandus after a few other alternatives.

In 1996 came their debut full-length album through Secula Delenda productions entitled "The Nightwinds Carried our Names", which was re-released by Total Holocaust records along with the demo in early 21st century.

After some years of silence Nefandus entered the studio (Endarker) in 2008 and recorded their second full-length CD "Death Holy death", which was released by Belfagor's Left Light Emanations with LP version through german World Terror Committee.

Soon the band will release a MCD entitled "Your God is a Ghost" through Daemon Worship Productions, professionally recorded at Endarker Studio with Devo Andersson as always handling the production/mixing/mastring, this time hitting harder and with more ferocity than ever, proclaiming the lunacy of "God's" creation like a fist in the faces of those who deny the wonders and pleasures of the cthunic Lords of divine "madness". May the blessing of Satan be with you all, and may the abominations of hell guide your ways beyond all morals...
