There are multiple artists that have used this name:

1. 3T are an American musical group made up of Tito Jackson and the late Delores "Dee-Dee" Jackson's three sons: Toriano Adaryll "Taj," Jr. (4 Aug 1973), Taryll Adren (8 Aug 1975) and Tito Joe "T.J." (16 Jul 1978). The brothers have a younger half-sister named Tanay Jackson who is also a singer-songwriter.

3T released their debut album Brotherhood in 1995. The album sold approximately six million copies worldwide. The group achieved an international hit with their debut single "Anything," and released several hit singles in Europe, including "24/7", "Why" (a duet with their uncle, Michael Jackson), "I Need You" (with a brief vocal appearance by Michael), "Tease Me" and "Gotta Be You." In 1996, they were ranked second, behind the Spice Girls, as the biggest-selling group in Europe. 3T have also written and produced songs for soundtracks to films as The Jacksons: An American Dream, Free Willy and Free Willy 2, Men in Black, and Trippin'.
After signing with the French label TF1/NRJ in 2003, 3T continued to perform in France, the Netherlands and Belgium. The group signed with the Dutch label Digidance in 2004 for Dutch releases, appearances and performances. The album titled Identity was released on March 23, 2004. Two singles were released: "Stuck On You" (a cover of the Lionel Richie song) was released in 2003 in France and Belgium, in 2004 in the Netherlands, and "Sex Appeal" in 2004.
In December 2005, it was announced that 3T would star in a television reality show, featuring the band trying to resurrect their career in the United States. This has not yet taken place. In 2007, Taryll announced on Myspace that he was recording a solo album. Some previews were added to his Myspace music account, but later were removed. From May to June of 2008, Taj and TJ (who joined later) filmed with their father Tito, apparently for an NBC documentary, with other members of the Jackson family. Taryll did not participate in these events due to personal circumstances as yet undisclosed.
