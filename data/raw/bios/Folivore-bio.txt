Santa Cruz, California (2010 - Present)

Deep in the Santa Cruz mountains there lurks a creature of unintelligible darkness. Slowly it creeps from its lair, hungry for the flesh of the weak and the souls of the damned. With incredible ferocity it rends spirit from flesh, incorporating both into the corruption of its being. And on its off days, it eats drugs in its peaceful forest home.
