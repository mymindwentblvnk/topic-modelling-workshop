Veil of Anguish formed in late 1995, and since then have been a growing darkness in the Australian underground metal scene. Initially playing raw and primitive Black Metal the bands developed over the years, incorporating other influences from Thash to Death Metal as well as adding a keyboard player. During this time the bands lyrical focus has also shifted, from the exploration of the ancestral roots of it's members to songs more based on horror and dark fantasy. The bands first demo HOWLING STORMS OF A FULL MOON was distributed worldwide on cassette in early 1996 gaining recognition and praise both locally and overseas, but it was not until 2004 that the band would unleash it's next official aural assault in the form of the SPIRITS IN THE FLESH MCD and SPIRITUAL ENTRAPMENT 7" which have also been very well recieved. A full length release to be titled THE MIDWINTER TRAGEDIES, having previously been recorded and scrapped, is in it's early stages and should be released before winter sees it's end (if not actually MID-winter). The band had gigged sparingly but consistently since it's inception in it's hometown of Geelong and nearby capital city Melbourne, including an opening spot for Death Metal legends Pungent Stench in early 2005, and has plans to take it's brand of Blackened Atmospheric Extreme Metal interstate upon the release of the album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Veil+of+Anguish">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
