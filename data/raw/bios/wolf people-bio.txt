Wolf People are an English psychedelic rock band based in London, Bedford and North Yorkshire. They formed in 2006 around the release of a very limited CD EP on Sea Records as part of the Lifeboat Series. The EP was Stuart Maconie’s record of the week on his BBC6 show. They then released three 7” singles on Battered Ornaments Records, they quickly sold out and are now becoming quite sought after.

The band have been embraced by the psych community receiving great praise in Shindig magazine and Terrascope.com amongst others. Influenced by Captain Beefheart, Can, Pentangle, Dungen, Amon Düül II and Television, the music is largely blues rock based but incorporates elements of folk, jazz, kraut, and country.

Wolf People signed to JAGJAGUWAR records in Autumn 2009 and have since released the singles collection TIDINGS and their debut full length Steeple.
