Tracing their roots to 2012, Melbourne’s Cryptic Abyss began life as a quartet. They have been steadily carving a name for themselves in the local scene as a relentless unit of groove metal infusing a broad range of influences. After a solid bout of jamming throughout Cryptic Abyss’ inception year, 2013 saw the band begin to tour seriously. Collecting spots alongside respected local acts such as Be'lakor, King Parrot, Desecrator, Eye of the Enemy, In Malice’s Wake, Mason, Orpheus Omega, Segression, Hybrid Nightmares and LORD to name a few, launching into 2014, this was fortified with appearances at the likes of Sonic Forge Festival 2014 among others.
2014 also saw Cryptic Abyss release their debut EP ‘Into The Abyss’ (21/03/2014) to success. On November 1st 2014 Cryptic Abyss announced their first ever gig as a five-piece following the introduction of bassist Kurt Morley to the band. With Cryptic Abyss’ debut album currently in the works (and expected for release in 2016), the groove metallers claim their influences wide and broad. With the likes of Black Sabbath, Lamb of God, Gojira, Sepultura, Slayer, Exodus, Testament, Cannibal Corpse, and Hypocrisy all strewn throughout the many layers of Cryptic Abyss’ music, you can be assured that within the Abyss there is still much to discover and much to fear.
