Headrot was formed in 1989 by Chris Sears , Skip Bradshaw , Derek M. and Jody G ... the band morphed to its most solid line up of :
Mike Brown - Guitar Derek M.- Bass Dan Sauro - Vocals Skip Bradshaw - Drums
They recorded and released 2 demos and a 7" and had much more music that never made it to the studio ... 

Headrot has shared the stage with such underground legends as Autopsy, Pungent Stench, Impetigo, Deceased, Incantation, Mortician, Decomposed, Human Remains, Phlegm, Vital Remains, Mythic, Moral Decay, Procreation, the list is long and my memory is burnt !! lol ... Headrot disbanded after their last show on december 19, 1993
