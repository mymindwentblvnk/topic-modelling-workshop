Wheels on the Bus are no longer together, but here's a biography from before they broke up..

Heavy and melodic riffs, bludgeoning drums and steadfast bass lines are encompassed by a thoughtful pop sensibility that defines Wheels on the Bus as a pronounced punk rock fury. Forming in 2001 and hailing from Brampton, Ontario, WOTB played throughout the core of one of the most vibrant independent music scenes in North America. Southern Ontario has become widely renown for its arsenal of punk, screamo and hardcore bands, spawning a variety of imitation acts in the wake of their success. Working against the tide, WOTB embody a diverse punk rock sound, the essence of which most bands could only dream of capturing. Their brand of gut wrenching melodies and perpetual harmonized riffs are layered onto heavy rhythms that reference a wide number of bands ranging from Sparta to Iron Maiden but never succumb to the confines of one genre. Meticulously structured songs and countless vocal hooks coalesce into a poignant and pop oriented rock that is best described as intense. The Fall of 2001 saw the release of WOTB's first independent EP, "796 the . of the Beast", which quickly sold out and is now out of print. The band built a reputation in Ontario as an explosive presence to be reckoned with, playing with such bands as Alexisonfire, Moneen, Crowned King. Consistently performing has gained them a loyal following and in 2004 they took the show on the road, touring Canada in support of their second independent release, "Take This Knife... From My Hands". Touted as a live act that isnt to be missed, WOTB are looking towards another cross Canada tour in the spring of 2005. This year will see their first full-length album and the band has no intentions of slowing down. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wheels+on+the+Bus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
