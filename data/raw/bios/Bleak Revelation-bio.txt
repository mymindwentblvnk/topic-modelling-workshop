Bleak Revelation is a Bulgarian melodic death/doom metal band. 

The roots of Bleak Revelation can be traced back to the early 2011, when Alexander Dimitrov (lead guitars) found some musicians who shared the same love for doom metal. Although the positions of second guitar player and vocalist turned out to be quite turbulent, the band rehearsed nearly two years with Anton Andonov (bass) and Hristo Petrov (drums).

In the beginning of 2013, Hristo employed himself to the recording of the second album of his main group Angercure, and shortly after that the then-singer also quit, leaving the band in limbo. Fortunately, Konstantin Zahariev (rhythm guitars) quickly found replacement in the face of Georgi (drums), and after a month of rehearsals took the vocal duties along with Anton. The four guys recorded, edited and mixed their self-titled demo in August/September and released it in Fall 2013.

Current line-up:

Alexander Dimitrov - lead guitar
