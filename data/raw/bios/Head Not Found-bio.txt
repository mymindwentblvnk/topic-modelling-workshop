Another nameless band was founded in 2005 when Kostyl', Burzum and Necrovlad decided to start a death metal project. Necrovlad already had ideas to hook up death metal form with traditionally more black metal topics like modern warfare, (neo)paganism and stuff.
In autumn 2005 first rehearsals took place and first songs began to develop. In 2006 Thrasher joins as drummer, but soon Kostyl' after important contributions to project decides to leave us which considerably slowed down further development of a band. During the end of 2007 HEAD NOT FOUND anyway managed to record a 3 song demo (unfortunately with computer programmed drum tracks) which was finally (self)released in beginning 2008. in late spring Thrasher decides to leave band, so HEAD NOT FOUND becomes solely two-man project.
