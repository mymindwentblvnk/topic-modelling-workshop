Autechre (/ɔːˈtɛkər/*, other pronunciations fine as well) is  an English electronic/IDM duo Rob Brown and Sean Booth, signed with Warp Records.

Much of Autechre's music has a strong focus on complex rhythm and driving percussion, and more recently, on meticulous sequencing. Later work has been notably experimental and abstract, in contrast to the more club-friendly and conventional early 1990s releases.

Booth and Brown formed the group in 1987 while they were both living in Rochdale, United Kingdom. They began by making and trading electro and hip-hop mixtapes, but gradually collected some cheap equipment (most notably a Casio SK-1 Sampler) and moved on to their own compositions.
