Formed in Gothenburg in 2013, Let Them Hang set out to be a death'n'roll power trio with a sonic wall of sound, a mixture of distortion, groove and intensity.
Drawing inspiration from old-school Death Metal, Punk, Hardcore and Rock'n'Roll, the result comes out as a pummeling assault on the senses.

All the members have previously contributed to the music scene in bands like EF, Mr. Death among others. Even though Let Them Hang is a new band, the experience is there!

They have released two EP's in 2014, to universal acclaim, Sweden's biggest metal magazine, Close Up, said the following "They probably takes the prize of being one of Sweden's grooviest Death Metal-acts". With a DIY approach, the music was recorded live in the studio and then released for free onto the world, for everyone to listen to.

Let Them Hang plays by the creed that music should be fun, loud, intense and made by and for fans.
