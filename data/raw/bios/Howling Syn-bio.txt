Hailing from Montreal, Howling Syn is the work of Patryk Pigeon (vocals, bass, programming).  Heavily influenced by the gothic scene, Howling Syn is a combination of orchestration, pounding rhythm, the angelic vocals of Sophie LeMay, and Patryk's own vocals (ranging from clean to harsh, sounding most akin to Fernando Riberio of Moonspell)

A new album is underway which promises to be heavier and more progressive than the first two albums. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Howling+Syn">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
