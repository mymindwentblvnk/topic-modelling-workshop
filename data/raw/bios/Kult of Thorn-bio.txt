Kult of Thorn is a crew of blasphemers, iconoclasts, and creatures of chaos who congealed in a spawning pool somewhere in the pit a few millenia ago and they just surfaced for a little rape, pillaging and to stand at the forefront in the march of the apocalypse!!

In the beating black furnaces of Phoenix AZ, the Kult of Thorn was formed straight from the portals of hell to wreak its plague across the blistered face of this Earth. Demons they are, and harbingers of the end of days. The auditory affront of the Kult of Thorn is a writhing spine of black metal and progressive steeped in classical influence. The hints of infernal inspiration come straight from the 9th circle. Our requiems of war, torture and misfortune wrought upon mortal and immortal alike are wreathed in melodies that echo the sorrows of the damned.
