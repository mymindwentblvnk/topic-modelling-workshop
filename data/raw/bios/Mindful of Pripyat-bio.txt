Year 2014: from the dystopic suburbs of a decaying city, entangled into a reality defaced by human error, ages of crisis leading to a perspective of post-apocalyptic future, three young freaks raise to blast and scream on a mixture of sickening grindcore/death noise, in vein of old school past acts like Napalm Death, Terrorizer, Agathocles, Ass√ºck and shit like that.
