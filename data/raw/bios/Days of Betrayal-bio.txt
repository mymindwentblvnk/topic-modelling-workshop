Days Of Betrayal was founded in the spring of 2004 in Eeklo (Belgium) with the intention to play furious metalcore, with a little wink to black metal and Gothenburg death metal. After five months of rehearsing, they were asked to play on the “meetjeslands metalfest”, a local festival with very heavy black and death metal acts. Where can we find the diapers…..? Beyond all expectations they didn’t get crushed by the intensive musical power and speed of the other bands. Some of the very extreme-metal minded crowd seemed to even like Days Of Betrayal. It became an unforgettable night! From that moment many shows followed, hardcore shows and even more metal shows. In April 2005 a two song demo was recorded, the first edition of 50 copies were sold out in one night!! ( limited to 200 copies sold out ,and still in demand) It was time to expand territory, from the Belgian coast to Luxembourg ,they tried to show up and play in as many Clubs, bars, and dumps as possible. In the autumn of 2006 DOB recorded their MCD “Autumns Coldest Embrace” at Midas Studios in Lokeren with the help of Tony De Block. In order to continue spitting out misanthropy and very fast and aggressive tunes.
In 2008 they brought their newer, heavier stuff to the people. They're first full length "Decapitated for Research".

Sadly enough, Days Of Betrayal decided to retire in 2010.. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Days+Of+Betrayal">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
