Absinthium were born in 2003 on initative of Dario Nuzzolo, who's searching for new members after the break up of his first band (Nighfliers). Line up is completed by Alfredo Contino (Vocals), Gianluigi Di Fenza (Guitars), Franco Buonocore (Guitars) and Umberto Dell'Anno (Drums).

Absinthium take part in "New Generation" exhibition in March 2004, playing their first own songs. During the ensuing months the band concentrates itself on writing and arranging the new tracks. In this period comes the split with Alfredo.

Not long after Luca Gargiulo joined the band as vocalist, line up was modified by the departure of Umberto and Gianluigi, replaced respectively by Tommaso Ruberti and Sergio De Salvin (then substituted by Gianluca Capasso).

In 2006 Absinthium record their first demo, receiving excellent feedbacks.


The following July, after months of illness, Luca dies of leukemia and his place is took, some months later, by Francesco Savastano.
