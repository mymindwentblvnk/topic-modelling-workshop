CHEREM formed in 2001 to promote veganism in the Salt Lake City hardcore scene. Tackling such issues as racism, sexism, and other political issues, Cherem quickly became one of the most prominent hardcore bands in Salt Lake City. Focusing on veganism and finding the answers to the mistake of human civilization, Cherem hit the studio and recorded a demo, later to be released as "In The Land Of The Dead" on New Eden Records in the summer of 2003. After several tours and events such as Rememberance Fest in Boise Idaho, Total Liberation Fest in Erie, PA and The follow up Total Liberation Tour west coast dates, Cherem hit the studio again and released "We Are The Revolution" on Outline Records, summer of 2006.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cherem">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
