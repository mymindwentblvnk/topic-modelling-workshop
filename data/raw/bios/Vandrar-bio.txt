Vandrar is a Black Metal band from Ludigslust/ Germany and was found from Sascha (guitar) and Robert (voice and guitar) in August of 2004 under the name Scorzonera. Shortly after that Karolin joined the band as bassist and first properities in songwriting could be announced. Because of the rapid way of working the first demo, named “Collaboration of mind”, was recorded under the name Scorzonera. First gigs followed. In the August of 2005 Scorzonera won a regional band contest. The prize was a recording session under professional guidance at the TON AB-Studio, the result was the second demo - Wayfarer. The drummer-problem was solved when Tobi, who already helped out as session-drummer, joined the band in October 2005. Scorzonera had to change the name into Vandrar because of legal reasons. 2006 Sascha left the band. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vandrar">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
