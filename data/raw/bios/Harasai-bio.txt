HARASAI is a five-piece metal act which embodies the creative symbiosis of melancholy, aggression and beautiful melodies since the rainy days of April 2006. The first demo CDs (“My Lake of Terror”, 2006, and “Begotten”, 2008) helped the young band to achieve attention from fans and the media. Within a short time, the group evolved into one of the most appreciated newcomer acts of the German underground scene. Shows were played nearly every weekend, a newcomer contest had been won, and screaming crowds were left longing for more.
In 2008, HARASAI went to the studio again to record their first professional demo “Into Oblivion”, which has been downloaded over 2000 times via various internet portals. “Into Oblivion” helped the band to get a support slot for the Unholy Alliance Tour in the same year, where HARASAI opened for SLAYER, TRIVIUM and AMON AMARTH in Cologne.
Following that, the band kept on playing live shows all over Germany and started to write, plan and organize their debut album which finally came to life in the summer of 2009. The band entered the CKB-Studios (KREATOR, JAPANISCHE KAMPFHÖRSPIELE) in the legendary Zeche Carl in Essen-Altenessen to record “The I-Conception“.
The mix and mastering was done by no one less than Dan Swanö (EDGE OF SANITY, BLOODBATH, DISSECTION, OPETH) in his Unisound-Studios in Örebro, Sweden. “The I-Conception” offers everything a metalhead loves: 45 minutes of fast-thrashing riffs, beautiful and thoughtful melodies, aggressive and variable vocals and a masterly performed production. Despite the numerous and clear influences of the musicians, HARASAI have a very own sound which is recognizable even under 1000 other bands.
Anno 2009 Harasai consist of Martin (20), Nico (20), Yannick (16), Henrik (22) and Dave (19), and they are ready to take on the world!  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Harasai">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
