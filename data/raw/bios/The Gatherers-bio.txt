2) The Gatherers are an early roots reggae group, led by vocalist Anthony "Sangie" Davis. They recorded "Words of My Mouth" in the famous Black Ark studio, produced by Lee "Scratch" Perry. Although their singles remain popular, a full-length record was never released--a sadly common occurrence in Jamaica.

3) The Gatherers is an indie electronic/synthpop band based out of Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA. Using the fusion of organic bass and drums combined with driven electronics and dreamy-to-dark synth lines, as well as live choppy electronics, The Gatherers have developed a unique sound and a very engaging live performance.
The album "Kurt Russell" was released independently by front man James Sturgis in July 2010, and is available for free download at http://thegatherers.bandcamp.com.
Members include: James Stugis (voice, synth, programing), Leigh Scariano (voice, synth, omnichord), Bon Baca (bass), Nathan Bickley (live electronics), David Ramon (drums and programing).
