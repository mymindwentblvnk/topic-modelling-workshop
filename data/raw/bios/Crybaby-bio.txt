There is more than one artist using the name Crybaby:

(1): Named after the soul song by  Garnet Mimms & The Enchanters  (later famously covered by  Janis Joplin ) , Crybaby is the alias of  Bristol, UK  singer/songwriter Danny Coughlan. The ten songs which make up the self-titled debut album Crybaby (2012) are beautifully crafted and imbued with a sparse, timeless clarity. Like the early rock ‘n’ roll, R ‘n’ B and soul records that provided influence, their simplicity is their essence; immediately engaging with melodies that settle quickly in the mind.

There are plans of a split 7" with Adult Braces (pat from spraynard). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Crybaby">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
