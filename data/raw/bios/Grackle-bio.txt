A washed up former reality TV child actor found peace in old synthesizers and substance abuse. After years of playing and making music for his own pleasure, Grackle finally decided to make his music known to the world by releasing a small sample of his vast works on the prestigious, yet obscure, Strange Life Records.
Grackle was mainly influenced by his “too fast” upbringing and listening to late night teen call in shows, ufo & paranoia programs, and obscure AM and college radio while taking long drives through the late nights and early morning on the country roads of the southern United States.
Grackle now spends most of his time in Brooklyn, collecting records and stumbling about in his basement studio. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Grackle">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
