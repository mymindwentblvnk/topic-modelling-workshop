Lil Bibby (Brandon Dickerson) is a young drill artist from the East Side of Chicago. His style of hip-hop, drill, was made popular by Chief Keef, but he is often described by critics as being more "lyrical." Lil Bibby claims 'EBK' in many of his song, which stands for 'EveryBody Killer'. His biggest influences are Lil Wayne and Gucci Mane. If he's been compared to the likes of Jay Z and Drake, he believes he doesn't sound like anyone in the music industry at this time. Lil Bibby's ultimate goal is to be considered as one of the greatest of all time like legends Tupac and Biggie.
