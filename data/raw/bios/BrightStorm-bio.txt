The band started in October 2012 as a cover project and already had most of its current members: vocalist Naimi Stephanie, guitarrist Léo Milani, bassist Flávio Gonçalves, and keyboardist Gabriel Bernardes. After their first show, drummer Odair Salles and guitarist joined the band. Noticing their potential to create original songs, the group decided to create a name and start composing, following the Gothic Metal genre.
