There is more than one artist with this name:

1) First to drink from the Teapot Of Doom were Murder One, described by Kerrang! as “One of the most ferocious bands ever to walk the earth!”, and boy, were they on the money! This six-piece UK outfit - featuring members and ex-members of Medulla Nocte, Pulkas and Raging Speedhorn - are an unrelenting experience from first note to last; a bit like having your shins consistently kicked by a delinquent child in steel-capped boots.

The band’s debut album, ‘Some Things Are Better Left Unsaid’ (GTA001), has been on release for a few weeks now, and the reviews have been uniformly excellent: 8/10 in Rock Sound, 8/10 in Metal Hammer and the FULL 5Ks in Kerrang!, where the record was straight away hailed as a testicles-in-a-tourniquet classic. Check out ‘Start Of The War’ for a statement of intent that should come complete with its own pot of woad, or the preposterously potty-mouthed ‘Born With Tourettes’, a track that mentions the word ‘f**k’ as often as Gordon Ramsey on a sponsored swear - yes, it’s that good! Somewhere a specially empowered nun is praying for their souls…
