1. Fjord are the young Canadian art-pop duo of Thomas Casault and Louis-Étienne Santais, who came to our ears earlier this year and left us completely stunned. Latest effort Blue, the follow up to their 2014’s debut EP Where We Lay, is a London Grammar-inspired piece, leaded by an impressive falsetto voice that stands out over a mat of atmospheric, haunting beats.

At this point, you may wonder who the female guest-singer is. Well, there’s no guest vocalist, because that’s not a female voice! All the vocals here are courtesy of Casault.

Despite Fjord’s debut EP has been a great starter, Blue is definitely something more musically significant. Applause.


Fjord is a Quebec-based electronic-pop duo that’s already released a debut EP back in September, but as far as quality goes, we’re thinking their latest effort, “Blue”, is the best of what Thomas Casault and Louis-Étienne Santais has offered thus far (and yes, those are male-sung vocals you’re hearing on the track).

“Blue” is surely an emotive listen, and it’s more on the ambient side than anything, but if you’re in the mood for it, a track like it is as good as any.

2. Fjord are also a Romanian instrumental band, their music bearing influences from Post Rock, Post Metal and Shoegaze. Having their music based mainly on atmospheric passages, Fjord arouses in the listener sentiments of nostalgia, making him go into a state of introspection and contemplation. Haviong deep roots also in Metal, the band alternates the atmosphere with passages of strength and vitality.
