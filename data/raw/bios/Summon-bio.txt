Summon is a black metal band formed in the spring of 1991 with the intent of creating extreme, brutal metal with influences like Bathory, Venom, Blasphemy, Beherit, Carcass, Morbid Angel, Celtic Frost, etc. By mid-1991, Summon began to perform live and managed to record a 4-track basement demo entitled Devourer of Souls (no longer available), but the band split up before it was released.

It would not be until 1995, after failed attempts with other efforts, that Summon would be exhumed from its shallow grave. By the winter of 1995, Summon recorded their first true demo entitled Fire Turns Everything...Black. In the summer of 1996 they recorded a demo CD Dark Descent of Fallen Souls (limited to 1000 copies). Much of 1997 and 1998 the band played numerous shows across the US, and continued to gain speed and velocity behind their already destructive sound.

By 1999 Summon created a full-length release that finally captured the extreme chaos they had always envisioned, Baptized by Fire [April 2000 on Baphomet/Necropolis Records].

The band split-up in 2006, but re-formed in 2010.

It has also been on hold 1992-1994 while the members played in Masochist. 

And The Blood Runs Black was unleashed to the masses in 2002 on Moribund records, followed in 2005 by their current crushing release Fallen. A European Tour in April and May gathered more followers to Summon's unholy flock, as do their continuing U.S. shows. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Summon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
