The band's second album, Driving Through The Crazy Blue, came from works recorded on different dates between 2003 and Summer 2006 and brought together in spring 2007 to create a medley of sounds and emotions from comedy to deep.

In spring 2007, Jacob also released a solo Album under the Bands name, 'Alone and the Space it Makes' is an experimental album with a slow haunting song undefinable other then to call it extremly experimental. 

The Band tries to keep their music raw and in the flesh with guitar solos and a wide range of different styles.
