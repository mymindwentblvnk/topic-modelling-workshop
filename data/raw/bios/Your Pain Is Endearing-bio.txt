Boston, Massachusetts, USA. (2008 - )

Your Pain Is Endearing is a modern death metal band from Boston, MA. Though they draw influence and inspiration for the current state of music, they do not seek to follow trends. Their musical journey is far more personal and the music reflects their need to satisfy these individual urges.

Created in 2008 by Jason Eick (Burn In Silence, Better Left Unsaid), Your Pain Is Endearing has combined devestating brutality and technical mastery, along with a thirst for pure aggression. Each member of YPIE has brought their own unique dynamic to the band, while working towards the common goals. Pushing their musical boundaries in both performance and composition, they deliver the memorable and intense live show metal fans crave.

Your Pain Is Endearing has released a six track EP entitled Fall of An Empire, as well as a music video for the track Dawn of the Apocalypse to support the EP. Currently, they are working with Darren Cesca (Goratory, Burn In Silence, Arsis) to complete their first full length titled The Human Condition.

Your Pain Is Endearing has shared the stage with great acts such as: Emmure, Born of Osiris, Catalepsy, Attila, This Time It's War, Deception of a Ghost, The Ghost Inside, Motionless in White, It Prevails, The World We Knew, Chelsea Grin, Hell Within, The Summoned, After the Burial and more.
