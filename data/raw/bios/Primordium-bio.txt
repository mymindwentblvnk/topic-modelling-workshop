About
"Forming late 2011 in central Indiana, Primordium; a 4-piece technical death metal group, possess unconditional intent to breach the boundaries of normality and take metal to new heights. Nearing the completion of their debut EP 'Aeonian Obsolescence', the members of Primordium assure you that listener satisfaction is guaranteed to those free of the chains that bind both musically and mentally." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Primordium">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
