--------

The band founded in the middle of 2007 near the German town Heidelberg. From the original LineUp soon only Dead Baron and Fax Ater remained, being unable to record any songs due to the lack of bass and drums. It took almost 3 years until finally, in january 2010, Fleischvarg had a new, complete LineUp to record some material which is going to appear on their first demo. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fleischvarg">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
