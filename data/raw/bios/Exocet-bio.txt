Exocet was launched in 2008 by the versatile labelfounder/producer/dj Ren√© Klimaczewski (aka Klima). He is known to insiders especially for his collaboration with the esteemed Architect. The latter was started by the also prolific Daniel Myer of haujobb. Since both are based in Leipzig (Germany) it was inevitable that their ways crossed. Result was in 2005 the up to now most appreciated Architect work The Analysis of Noise Trading.
Visiting New York in 2007, Klima found inspiration in the late artist Dave Kean - not a musician but full of weird ideas and creativity. Here and then Exocet was conceived. Under this influence Klima produced Violation, released 2008 on ant-zen, well received by the industrial noise crowd.
In 2009 the second effort, a much darker album Grotesque Consumer came to light. Now on his own Klima and his music appeared to be afflicted by the tragic death of his former muse. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Exocet">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
