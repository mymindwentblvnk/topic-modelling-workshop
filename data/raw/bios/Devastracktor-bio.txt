Devastracktor was formed in the summer of 2009. The idea was - and continues to be - to revive the unruly speed/thrash spirit from the late 80s and early 90s, instrumental genius and topics mixing humor and more serious, controversial messages together. The debut album "Warhorsepowers & Megaton of Balls" was released as a small independent release early in the year, and later by No Sign Of Life in 2011. During its short history the band has had the privilege to perform with cult bands such as Angel Witch and Manilla Road, and also took the main stage of Hammer Open Air -festival by storm. The members have history in many kinds of metal bands from Death metal to Power metal, with years of performing & recording experience.

Original bassist Joni Meriläinen was replaced with Johannes Lahti in 2012, who in turn was replaced with Miska Lehtivuori (ex-Fall of the Leafe, Ablaze in Hatred etc.) in early 2014. Original vocalist Jaakko Riihimäki left the band to pursue other interests - including his main instrument, lead guitar and his favored genre of folk/doom metal - in early 2013. He was replaced with Jukka Korkiamäki, whose first live concert with the band was on November 30th, 2013. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Devastracktor">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
