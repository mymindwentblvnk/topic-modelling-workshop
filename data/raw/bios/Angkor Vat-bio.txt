Crossover death/thrash from Montevideo, Uruguay. The band changed their style on every release. On the first demo they played a more traditional thrash metal, then on Southern Blood they played old school death/thrash with guttural vocals, and on Neutro they played a more modern form of death/thrash. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Angkor+Vat">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
