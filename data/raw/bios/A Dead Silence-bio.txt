A Dead Silence is a 5-piece death metal band from Adelaide, South Australia. After the bands inception at the beginning of 2009, A Dead Silence made it's live debut in June the same year and since then, we have played a large number of shows and also have our EP coming out in the near future. We will have updates for you all soon regarding the EP! 
Early 2010, A Dead Silence recruited new frontman Ricky Felix whom can be heard on their latest pre-production track "The Art Of Martyrdom".
