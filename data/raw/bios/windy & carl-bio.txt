Windy & Carl is the music project of husband and wife musicians Windy Weber and Carl Hultgren. They began collaborating on music in 1993 in Dearborn, Michigan, United States.
Their sound is very slow, dreamy, and based in drones. Using guitar, bass, and some keyboards and electronic effects as well as Windy's singing on some tracks they create long delicate washes of sound. They released their first album "Portal" in 1994, followed by several other full-lengths on the Blue Flea, Darling and Kranky labels.
After a few years of inactivity, they released an EP titled "The Dream House" in 2005. A new double album, "Songs for the Broken Hearted", was released in October 2008. They are currently signed to Kranky Records.
