(There are two last fm artists called Vagrant.)

1: Vagrant is the sound of a wanderer returning to his rock roots. An idea whose rejection of the mainstream lead to an endless sojourn, drifting from one philosophy to another, one aesthetic to the next. Every attempt to find a home reminds him why he left the last one. Every attempt to become a part of a group makes him more of a loner, brings his alienation into sharper focus. In the end, the wanderer must accept his fate and embrace the journey. "The most submissive thing in the world can ride roughshod over the most unyielding in the world - that which is without substance entering that which has no gaps." - Lao Tzu

Vagrant began as the solo project of veteran Philadelphia-based musician John Von Glaubitz, aka Slim Jenkins. During his tenure as a guitarist, composer, and producer he has worked (and continues to work) with such diverse artists as Hang virtuoso Dante Bucci, hip-rock super-group Bunjii, Afrobeat musician Olurotimi Hundeyin and d Afrophonik Rhythms Crew, the groovy singer and songwriter AlyCat, and the hard-hitting psychodelic jazz-rockers The Urban Giants. He has also recieved critical aclaim for his work composing original music for dance with choreographer Stephen Welsh, as well as his work as a composer and sound designer for the Flashpoint Theatre company.
