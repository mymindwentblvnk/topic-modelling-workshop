Xavier Thomas, known by his production moniker of Débruit, is a producer, DJ, instrumentalist and vocalist from Paris, France. He has been playing saxaphone since the age of 9, and now, at the age of 28, works as a freelance sound designer for several clients. He has released an LP as Débruit last year on the label Musique Large called “Coupé Décalé”, twisting flamenco guitars, field recordings, and just about any sound he can get his hands on, into his electro hip-hop noise Débruit trademark. He has an EP “Clé De Bras” forthcoming on Musique Large March 2009 and he also records as part of his hip-house project called Kéèclac. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/D%C3%A9bruit">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
