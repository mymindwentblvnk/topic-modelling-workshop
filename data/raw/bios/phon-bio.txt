Phon is a collaboration between friends Dustin Dorsey and Drew Robertson.  The two-piece formed from a mutual love of gorgeously strange sounds and music.  Phon makes textural layers of field recordings, electronics, guitars, and feedback, that result in feelings as disparate as being wrapped in a cloud blanket, and being drudged along the ocean floor.  The pair also make stand alone sound art installation pieces and are part of the art collective Team Lump.  Releases include the Gaze ep, released on their own CDr imprint Stethoscopic Heart Recordings, and their full length album the Orm release on Iseler Communications Recordings.  Both were engineered by the groups oft-third member Tim Iseler at SOMA EMS  in Chicago.
