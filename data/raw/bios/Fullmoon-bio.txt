Seminal NS Black Metal band from Poland. One of the most influential bands within the NSBM scene. Their demo 'United Aryan Evil' is widely considered a milestone in Black Metal.

Fullmoon's discography comprises mostly of demos and rehearsals, all highly sought after by collectors. The United Aryan Evil demo gained a full length release in 1996. Rob Darken from Graveland participated in the song writing on this album and also engineered it.

The band split up in 1997 and members have gone on to participate in other Polish bands such as Ohtar, Selbstmord, and Thor's Hammer. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fullmoon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
