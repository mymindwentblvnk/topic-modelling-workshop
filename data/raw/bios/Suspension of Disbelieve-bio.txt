After four Promo-CD’s and some successes in winning band competitions, play on some festivals like Babypop and IJsselpop, and giving a show as guest of Barry Hay of Golden Earring, the band played on a regular basis in the club-circuit. After a change of vocalists, the band continued in a new direction with two female singers: the great voice of Stella Bonelli and the pure voice of Mariwijn Crezee. 

Together with the progressive rocksound with metal, symphonic and even jazz influences, the band produces a intense and unique sound that is often compared with bands like The Gathering and Autumn.
