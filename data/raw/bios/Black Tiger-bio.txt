Black Tiger, born Urs Baur, is the first rapper to rap in a Swiss German dialect. Those now legendary rhymes appeared on the track "Murder by Dialect" (1991), by P-27 featuring Black Tiger. Later, Black Tiger recorded an album with MC Rony and established the group Skeltigeron with Skelt from P27 and MC Rony. He then focused on his solo career, his solo album "Solo" is seen by some as one of the best rap albums from the German-speaking part of Switzerland. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Black+Tiger">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
