"After playing in different sinister/abrasive synth punk bands, the members of Bubonic Plague have found each other and mastered a sound, testament to the still thriving (and still underground) L.A. punk scene. Playing over a drum machine—more of an "unmanned" fifth instrument than a click track—Bubonic Plague can totally thrash a song yet still stay tethered by the programmed segments, riding a jerky groove then killing it in just enough time for you to really enjoy it. They seem to be on the brink of unloading a spray of feedback and looped vocals, but they just barely hold off. Maybe the motive is not to get under your skin, but to get stuck in your head."
