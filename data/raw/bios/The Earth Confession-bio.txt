The mastermind of The Earth Confession Sigitas Vėlyvis was the singer for the Lithuanian prog/heavy metal band Spellbound  in the 90's. Spellbound  released two tape albums "Longing For The Origin" (1995) and "Breath" (1997). After the accident death of his brother Rokas back in 1997 who played guitar in the same band, Spellbound played several gigs with different line-up, but broke-up due to the different musical tastes. After the split-up Sigitas joined another Lithuanian band Ruination, did several gigs with them and recorded 3-track CD "Drive To Live".

In 2004 he decided to form his own project called Goetheanum. The name was chosen under the influence of Rudolph Steiner anthroposophy concept. New material was presented at some local gigs and festivals like Kunigunda Lunaria and Ferrum Frost. Due to the unstable line-up the recording of the first album was delayed for a long time. Sigitas Vėlyvis decided to go an extreme way and program the musical side of the whole album by himself. Another decision was to rename band to the actual name The Earth Confession. "The old name was great, but it was too much related with Rudolph Steiner writings while the whole concept of the music has grown to the wider dimensions", says Sigitas.

After 6 years of experimenting with different sounds and virtual instruments the debut album “Unearthly Refrains” was released on the 4th of March 2011. Sigitas recorded, arranged, programmed and mixed everything by himself. The drums parts were done by Soul Stealer drummer Šarūnas Venckus and some guitar takes by good old friend Majonezas. The result are nine tracks which move somewhere between progressive, psychedelic and electronic rock with some heavier moments. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Earth+Confession">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
