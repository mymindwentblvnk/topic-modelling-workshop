Trè Samuels (born 1999), is a singer and model from Australia. In May 2016, he released his debut EP Lost in Translation and a music video for 100, his first solo single. He describes his sound as "not conventional R&B; the writing style is very free and melodically dreamy. My music always explains how I’m feeling, sonically and lyrically". As a model, he already walked for Dior Homme, Valentino, Y-3, and Lanvin in Paris, as well as Public School, Tim Coppens, Orley, Richard Chai, Billy Reid, and Perry Ellis.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tre+Samuels">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
