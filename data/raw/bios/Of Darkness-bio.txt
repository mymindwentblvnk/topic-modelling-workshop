Of Darkness is an experimental funeral doom band from Barcelona, Spain born in 2004. Their music includes the most representative traits of the genre, along with other varied influences such as ambient, industrial and classical music. Highly atmospheric and deep, their sound is the perfect landscape for their extreme nihilistic beliefs. 

The band's first album The Empty Eye was released in 2005 under the spanish label Xtreem Music. It consists of one track with a duration of nearly one hour.
The 2nd album Death had 2 or 3 tracks depending on the release.

In 2010 Black Mass Records released a compilation of both albums. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Of+Darkness">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
