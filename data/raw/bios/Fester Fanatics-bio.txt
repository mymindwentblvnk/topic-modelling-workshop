Originally formed as an offshoot of Massive Appendage (featuring all members except Fester) in 1987, Sydney's Fester Fanatics quickly gained in notoriety for their slapdash, none-too-serious approach to thrash metal mayhem. The band quickly became as popular in Melbourne as they were in Sydney and toured interstate as often as the core members' workloads (Snuff and Jed were also in Massive Appendage and Kings Cross at the time) allowed. The second album was a collection of raucous and shambolic covers; Fester Fanatics split in 1990 with each member moving in different directions. In 1992 the band reformed in Melbourne around Fester and Jed while the latter was also a member of Starworld and carried on through various formations until well into the 1990s. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fester+Fanatics">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
