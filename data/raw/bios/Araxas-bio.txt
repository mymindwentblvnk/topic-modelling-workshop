In spring 2009 Leonhard Waltersdorfer began to write songs for the first demo "Dunkelheit". He wanted to combine Black Metal with orchestral music. After that demo he started to write songs which were not so overpacked with synths. The 3-song-demo "With Fear in my Head" was the result. In late summer the demo "Suicide of my Mind" was released, which was the first step into the Depressive Black Metal genre. "Das Ende der Gezeiten" followed, which is the newest demo by now. All demos can be either downloaded for free or be bought by sending an e-mail to „leonhard.waltersdorfer@gmx.at“
