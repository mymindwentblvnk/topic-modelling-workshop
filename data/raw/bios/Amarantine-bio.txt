Amarantine was formed in 2007 by a group of players with several years of history playing together. The band started progressing towards an experimental, eerie sound that, according to the artist, is hard to categorize in any particular sub-genre of metal. Doom / dark / melodic death metal describes their music best.

Current lineup:
Toni Toivonen - Vocals
Perttu Kajatkari - Guitar
Jarno Tervo - Guitar
Roni Ã„rling - Bass
Nino Hynninen - Keyboards
Rainer Tuomikanto - Drums
