Godslastering, dutch for blasphemy, started as a 2-man black metal project, which was founded by drummer Robin and guitarist Pascal in the early weeks of 2009. The purpose of the band was to stand up against religion, spread the words of hate, and to share a less heard kind of black metal.

Godslastering was a 2-man project, until a few weeks after the beginning. An old friend applied for the bassguitar. His offer was accepted, but shortly thereafter he had to leave 'cause of his job.

After half a year of practise and songwriting, the project made place for a second project: 'Pigfarm' grindcore. Godslastering was paused for about half a year, until Pigfarm disbanded in February 2010. Godslastering resumed practising with a more serious attitude. A month after the 'new beginning', old bassguitarist Robin rejoined the line-up.

After the re-union, Godslastering worked hard to get their demo ready. which is finally released!
