"Ager thu die wolvin, vore die avegront" - Behind you, the wolves, before you , the abyss
 
"Witte Wieven" is a dutch sage telling us about the mists hanging above the fields. Some believe the mists are wandering ghosts of heartbroken women.They lure men to dance with them... until they die.
 
A pretty sight, with a dangerous, tempting darkness. A taste of that atmosphere, will be heard in Witte Wieven's debut EP 'Silhouettes of an Imprisoned Mind'. This two-piece band will bring you a blend of black metal, dissonance and dreamy landscapes. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Witte+Wieven">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
