Morkenatten originally started out as Frater M.K.S.'s one man project, even predating the O.O.A. M.K.S. released one promo limited to 20 copies (Against All Life), on which Frater V.H. played bass and did the mastering. Later, after the creation of the O.O.A. Frater E., Frater V.H. and later Frater A. joined the project as well permanently for the recordings of Morkenatten's split with De Vermis Mysteriis, « Ayin Harsha ». Currently Morkenatten is writing new material for a future release.

The project's sound translates itself to both atmospheric raw black metal and dark ambient. Lyrically Frater M.K.S.'s main focus for the project is misanthropy, seen from a concrete, as well as from an abstract point of view. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Morkenatten">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
