BIOGRAPHY

WOUNDS OF CHRIST took form in the early 2006, with musicians of the disappeared band "The Macabre" [Chile]. This happened because of some changes the band went through involving the Lyrics and Musical Composition of all songs, and also the joining of a new drummer, achieving the adaptation of their tracks, in order to get a different sound far from The Macabre, resulting in a completely more brutal sound. The band now has their first demo up recorded in August 2007, so you can listen to it in their bands Myspace. WOCÂ´s Lyrics are based in Anti-Christianity, related to the non-acceptance of christian saints, symbols and pseudo-idols.
