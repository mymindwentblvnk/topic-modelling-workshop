There are several artists named Silencer:

1) Silencer was a Swedish depressive black metal band formed in 1995. They released one album Death - Pierce Me in 2001 before splitting up. The album had a major impact on the Swedish underground scene at the time. The band has been the subject of much controversy, mainly because of several allegations made against their vocalist Nattramn, who was supposedly institutionalized shortly after the album was released, thus forcing the band to split up.

2) Silencer is an alias for FMM vs Dylan Rhymes. The main reason for this is that the guy's were ideally looking for an album deal to continue on the huge start made with Acetate. Critical mass came up with a great deal for the album and so the project was signed with them late 2002. The name was changed to give the album artists more of a combined identity rather than two already established artists combining in a one off project.

3) A death metal band from Colorado, US, Silencer formed in 1998 and released several demos and EPs before releasing their first full-lenght album, "Death of Awe", in 2005, followed by "Divisions" in 2009.Is currently active and signed to Mausoleum Records.

4 ) 20 year old DJ. The genres he covers are grime, hip-hop and RnB. Silencer is also the DJ and a producer for the group Underground Unit. Silencer began to DJ at the tender age of 14.
