Ever Circling Wolves is a metal band from Helsinki, Finland, formed in 2007. Ever Circling Wolves have released three records so far: the demo ep Picturesque, Petrified in 2007 with Henri Harell from Morg (fin) (guitar, vocals) as the sole member and in 2009 their self-released full-length debut The Silence from Your Room with the line-up completed by Niko Karjalainen, the bassist of FFTC (earlier known as For Funerals to Come) on drums, Otto Forsberg of Svetogorsk and Vanhakaupunki on guitar and Arttu Kantola of No (fin) and Freedomination on bass. Arttu left the band in 2010 and was replaced by Sami Nevala, previously of Icarian. With Sami in tow, ECW recorded one new song and rerecorded an older one in the winter of 2010-11. These tracks are available for download on the internet in addition to a limited Digipack CD release.

From their official page (http://www.ecwdoom.com):
A combination of notes sometimes compels people to listen to them. This is a collective brought together by the will to create some of those combinations and perform them to those that are compelled by them. Positioned in the darker end of the spectrum, as far as music goes, these four good people seek to enlighten and cleanse aurally; a good scrub will hurt some.
