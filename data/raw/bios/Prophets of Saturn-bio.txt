Warping out of a blackhole in the British Midlands at the speed of sludge, fuzz drenched tone wizards Prophets of Saturn are a new force for bluesy psychadelic rock. 
Hanging their retroscopic riffs amidst a vortex of billowing effects, cosmic waves of sonic dirt and Eastern drones; vocals climb and soar the wall of sound, scattering tales of world ending sub spacial terror to encourage the turning on, the tuning in and the rocking out.

The Prophets of Saturn cut their first tracks in an analogue trance, aided by the mighty “state” production team. 
 Since then the Prophets have hit the ground running, playing a handful of well received gigs amid a smokey haze and oil light projections to rival the Exploding Plastic Inevitable.
 A return to the studio for further tracks of their 60s influenced doom / psyche is imminent.

 A number of tracks from their forthcoming debut LP have already been inflicted upon radio-fiends and death-streamers across the web including several on the mightily influential US stoner/doom podcasts 'The Soggy Bog of Doom'; as a result the Prophets have picked up international interest and fans. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Prophets+of+Saturn">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
