The swedish band Trash

TRASH, a back to basics Hard Rock outfit, was formed in 1982 by guitarist Mike Mocadem (a.k.a. Mikael Mujanne) and vocalist Ron Taylor (real name Tony Hellander). Both Mocadem and guitarist Gene Ball (Jens Grundelius) were previously members of STONEHENGE. Drummer Pete Jägerhult was ex-ATTACK and TEMPLEROCK.

TRASH released a debut album, 'Watch Out', on major label RCA Records in 1982. Jägerhult was soon replaced by Henrik 'Hempo ' Hilldén and original bassist Rudy Fluch by Kaj 'Coda' Söderström. TRASH's more impressive second album 'Burnin Rock' found the Swedes signed to Atlantic. The record was produced by the illustrious Max Norman and 1985 saw TRASH touring America with KEEL and BON JOVI. Afterwards, the group recording a third album with the esteemed Eddie Kramer in the production chair but the band split before its release, so the recordings were iced.

Mike Mocadem remained in North America to put together the American based act TRASH & PASSION whilst Gene Ball became a member of RAIN. Hilldén has since worked with JOHN NORUM, GLENN HUGHES, DOKKEN and KING SIGUURD. By 1997 he was a member of MANDRAKE ROOT. Hellander, meantime, formed TITANIC TRUTH with ex-ELECTRIC BOYS mentor Conny Bloom.

And then there is Trash, born from the no future stable, creators of Industrialsamplecoregouchbeat, drill and bass 10 years before it's time and pioneered by the self-destructive cider-fuelled duo, Mat Consume and Lynton Million. Seek and it shall be yours.

Loose and piledriving riffs with also at times a fine sense of pop (they were a Dunedin band after all -- home to The Clean, 3Ds, etc...) Bruce Blucher vocals at times also recall Joy Division-Ian Curtis.

They put out a few singles and albums in the early '90s.
