Frozen Flame was born in may 2008. The band comes from Argentina, blending goth music with  heavy metal, and introducing leading female  singer Sophie. This journey began when four members of Decay of Mankind decided to keep rocking when this band was dissolved. A brand new to the scene leading singer auditioned and they just knew she was the one. After having a hard time finding a decent keyboard player, they finally came to meet Marcelo, who reminded them that classic piano blends just right with heavy metal. And so it begins, Frozen Flame.
