New End Original formed out of Jonah Matranga's (Far, Onelinedrawing, Gratitude) need for another rock project.  Recruited in to help him out were Scott Winegard (Fountainhead, Texas is the Reason), Norman Arenas (Shelter, Texas is the Reason) and Charlie Walker (Chamberlain).
The band signed to Jade Tree records and unfortunately only lasted two years before splitting up.  In that time they managed to release one album, 'Thriller', and one single, 'Lukewarm'. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/New+End+Original">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
