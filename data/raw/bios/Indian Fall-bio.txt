I think the roots of Indian Fall are buried in the beautiful feeling that only music can engender. Indian Fall was born when I met Adrian Vitanescu in February 1997. We attended few festivals and at our first show outside our native town, Adi Vitanescu won the prize for “the best guitar player”. It was cool that nobody knew who were we but…the adventure had begun. In 1998 we recorded our first demo called “Shadows”. It was a home based studio recording and we did our best. In the year of 2001 we attended the most famous festival in Romania, Top T Buzau. The big prize was a contract with Promusic Production, a metal label from the fewest in Romania. Well, we won again and the end of the year we released our first album, Pathfinder. We had an excellent feedback from Romania and also from Germany, Canada and Japan. The year 2002 brought an EP released on mini-cd called “Counting the Emptiness”. Time passes fast and and in 2007 we started working for the new album “Seasons in Equilibrium”. The album was released in 2009 and it was mastered by Dan Swano at Unisound Studios in Sweden.
Fear: 4 Stages is our last material record in the Consonance Studio and produced by Sol Faur (Dordeduh) and Hupogrammos Discuple's (Dordeduh) (ex Negura Bunget).
