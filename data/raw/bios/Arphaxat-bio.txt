Arphaxat is the project of Shaxul (Annthennath, ex-Hirilorn, ex-Deathspell Omega, etc.) and Draken (Putrefactor).  Shaxul performs drums and bass while Draken handles vocals.  They wanted to remain a duo and opted to handle the bass guitar parts as if they were guitar parts, using heavy distortion (in three layers, one of them clean bass) to make it sound as true to primitive black metal traditions as possible.

Arphaxat has released one demo, Ex Inferis (2003), and one LP, Loudun la Maudite (2008).

"Arphaxat was a Persian sorcerer who was killed by a thunderbolt. Then the name appeared again as a demon, possessing nuns. And one of these nuns lived in our region called Pictavia. The history of these possessions is the concept of our first album." - Shaxul
