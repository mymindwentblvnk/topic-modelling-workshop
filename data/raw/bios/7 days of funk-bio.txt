The King of Modern Funk meets the smoked-out scion of G-Funk on the 7 Days of Funk album, where Snoop Dogg performs under the name Snoopzilla, the homage to the legendary funk master, Bootsy Collins, who often went by the moniker Bootzilla. After an initial chance meeting two years ago, Dam and Snoop began to collaborate when Snoop invited Dam to perform with him at a 2011 SXSW show — the musical connection was inherent.

"Snoop knew what I was thinking without me having to articulate it. That’s how you know when you gel artistically with someone," Dam-Funk says. "These beats were made for him and he laid down some of the smoothest harmonies and melodies I’ve ever heard. It’s hip-hop, but you can also hear what we grew up on, from Zapp to Evelyn 'Champagne' King and Patrice Rushen."

As an entertainment icon, there is little Snoop hasn’t accomplished. The Long Beach legend has sold over 30,000,000 albums, and received 15 Grammy nominations, but at heart, the funk has inspired many tracks through his career.

Growing up at the other end of L.A. was Pasadena’s Dam-Funk. Since his 2009 debut, Toeachizown, the Stones Throw-signed visionary has defined modern funk music—this isn’t a fad for him, it’s a way of life. He’s the new vanguard of a tradition encompassing George Clinton, Roger Troutman, Prince, and Snoop Dogg, himself, who helped pioneer G-Funk with Dr. Dre. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/7+Days+Of+Funk">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
