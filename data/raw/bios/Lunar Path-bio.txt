So far they have released two demos (Lunar Path (2007) and  Calling (2008)), one EP (Broken World, 2009) and a single (Promise Me & Thin White Lines, 2011).

Even though they're still rather unknown as a band, they have performed as a warm-up for names such as Deathstars, Paul Di'Anno, Ava Inferi and Swallow the Sun. They also opened Copehagen Live festival in 2010, playing just before Slash (line-up featured names such as Rammstein and Bullet for My Valentine). 

Right now, band is looking for record/distribution contract for their 15-track debut album, Memento Mori.
