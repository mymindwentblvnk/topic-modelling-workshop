Lame. Somewhere between the absurd and illiterate is Wolfbait. Imagine for a moment claiming you sounded like if Thin Lizzy were fronted by Ronnie James Dio. Or, perhaps, imagine Danzig singing for Iron Maiden. This is the fantasy which Wolfbait inhabits.

They are a four-piece soft rock outfit with a 'heavy' emphasis on harmonized guitar riffs. The songs are catchy, loud and 'EVIL'. But we're not talking power-pop here; rest assured: these boys keep things flaccid. The songs just have a way of sticking in your head the next day, like some sort of bad elevator music.

The stage show is equally forgettable. Cloaks and fake blood are typical fare. Stage choreography and mustaches are an added gimmick. Wolfbait embraces the type of pompous grandeur that is shunned by so many of today's groups.

The members of Wolfbait have been playing in local 'bands' for nearly ten years. However, the santa has lured them from playing the traditional country and gospel hymns... forcing them to sing his praise in rock obscurity. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wolfbait">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
