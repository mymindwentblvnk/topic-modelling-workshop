1.)Human Touch is an elevatingly innovative instrumental trio. Based in Athens, Greece, they have established their own musical hybrid of universal soul. Between them they have played with Arturo Sandoval, Trilok Gurtu, Billy Cobham, Arild Anderson, Milcho Leviev, Davy Spillane, The Temptations, Barry White, The Camerata String Orchestra and others.

They have played in several international jazz and ethnic festivals in Europe, Turkey and the Balkans and have influenced whole generations of instrumentalists in Greece.

Their unique multi-instrumental approach not only makes a visual impression but projects Human Touch's limitless palette of rhythm, colour and emotional depth. Human Touch's music is 'lived' music. Each concert is its own experience and leaves its audiences uplifted and moved within.

It's no wonder they have been called
'The Best Kept Musical Secret in the Balkans'.
