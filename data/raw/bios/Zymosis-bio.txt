Zymosis is a psychedelic music project which has brought a bright light to the psy culture over the past 10 years. Zymosis is composed of two people from Kyiv, Ukraine who share their minds and souls to make you fly into the depth of trance.

Dimitro and Gree Shanti have devoted themselves to music and they continue to expand consciousnesses.

It is difficult to pin down their style, mixing elements of psytrance, downbeat, and ambient.

Zymosis is known not only in Ukraine, but has also featured prominently in a number of international special music events like Space of joy 2005-2006(www.spaceofjoy.ru), Sisto Palty 2006-2007(www.spaceofjoy.ru), & Trimurti 2007(www.trimurti.ru)
