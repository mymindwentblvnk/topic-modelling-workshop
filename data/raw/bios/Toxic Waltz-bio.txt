In the beginning of 2009 in Landsberg am Lech, Bavaria, Germany, TOXIC WALTZ were founded by lead guitarist Jimi and ex-drummer Tim. Bass guitar player Rahman, vocalist Angelo and rhythm guitarist Alex joined the band soon to form a THRASH METAL ensemble that is clearly affected by the US BAY AREA style (e.g. EXODUS, HEATHEN, DARK ANGEL), neither leaving out influences from other genres nor lacking recognition value. The ex-drummer Tim was replaced by Flo in 2013.
TOXIC WALTZ are delivering aggressive, but artistically demanding THRASH, characterized by diversi-fied songwriting. The band's unique style and live experience, originated with many smaller gigs, earned them bigger venues soon.
TOXIC WALTZ shared the stage with well-known bands like SIX FEET UNDER, ALPHA TIGER and DEBAUCHERY.
With their full-length debut record “Decades of Pain” which was released in the beginning 2014 TOXIC WALTZ definitely will get some serious attention. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Toxic+Waltz">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
