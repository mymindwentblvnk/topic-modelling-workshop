James LaBrie's MullMuzzler began to take shape in the summer of 1998, after the last leg of Dream Theater's extensive Touring Into Infinity World Tour. James started the project by collaborating with some of the most talented songwriters in the progressive rock genre: Trent Gardner (Magellan, Explorers Club), Matt Guillory (Dali's Dilemma), Gary Sloyer, and Carl Cadden-James, Brendt Allman, and Gary Wehrkamp (all from Shadow Gallery). Working together, the musicians began to craft the songs for MullMuzzler's first CD, "Keep It to Yourself", released in 1999. A second album, "MullMuzzler 2", followed in 2001. Both albums feature Brian Beller on bass, Mike Keneally on guitar, and Mike Mangini on drums, as well as musical contributions by LaBrie's co-writers Gardner and Guillory.

LaBrie has continued to collaborate with Guillory since 2001, but the resulting albums "Elements of Persuasion", "Static Impulse" and "Impermanent Resonance" have been released under LaBrie's own name.

The term, LaBrie's creation, refers to gagging or silencing an individual's thought before it can be expressed in any manner, as he described it. He created the word from the combination of the words "mull" (meaning to ponder thought) and "muzzle" (meaning to gag) <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mullmuzzler">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
