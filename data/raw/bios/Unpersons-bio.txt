Unpersons formed in Savannah Georgia and have since found most of the band relocated across the globe. They've been churning out scatterbrained, unconventional harsh and heavy hardcore since 1997. Previous works include an epic full length CD "III" released on At a Loss Recordings, a self titled cd released on Born to Die, and a 7" on Fishfur records. This new release is a 15-minute distortion-drenched dirge ranging from wild and brutal to brooding and dark, often conjuring up the ghosts of United Mutations, Jesus Lizard, Rudimentary Peni, and Rorschach. Recorded at the Jam room in South Carolina.. mixed and produced by Unpersons and Phillip of Kylesa.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Unpersons">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
