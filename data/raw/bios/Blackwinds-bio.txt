Blackwinds members are Mysteriis,composing and playing on all instruments and Infaustus who is performing the vocals.In the band,they are doing everything all by themselfs which means the lyric writing,recording,mixing and mastering are tottaly under their control.They dont want their art to get dirty by some outsiders and have the standart sound.The Black Metal for them is individuality and nothing gets them angry more than those bands,which are following the latest tendentious,getting the accordingly image and recording albums with the absolutely same sound like their idols.They are choosig the path of the leader,not the path of the follower.Because they are loyal to the black art they have specificial sounding witch not many groups can reproduce. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Blackwinds">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
