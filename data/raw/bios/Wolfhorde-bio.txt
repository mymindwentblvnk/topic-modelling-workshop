Wolfhorde are heathen folk/thrash metal band from Finland. Wolfhorde was founded in the city of Keuruu by 4 fellows (Hukkapätkä, Werihukka, Haaska and Raato) who wanted to try and make a band and just play together and see what happens. The result is listenable as this thrashy and folkish metal band with lyrical themes such as paganism, shamanism, nature, pre-christian mythologies, violence, hatred, misanthropy, lycanthropy and all the shit that has happened or you’d ever imagine happening.
