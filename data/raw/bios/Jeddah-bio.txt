Jeddah was a NWOBHM band based on the english county of Gloucestershire. They released a single in 1984, on their own Death label, which presented beatles classic song Eleanor Rigby as its A-side. The arrangements for this version were quite innovative at the time, incluiding heavy guitar riffs and various tempo changes. The other song included was an original composition called "Ghosts (Never Leave You Behind)".
No further releases of the band are known at present. Jeddah probably disbanded at the second half of the 80's decade. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jeddah">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
