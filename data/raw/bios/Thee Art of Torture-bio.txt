Originally formed in Bakersfield, California by Dennis Slattery, Gilbert Mares and Josh Meyer, this death metal/grind band's unique sound has taken the west coast by storm.  Featuring its newest members: Justin McKinney and Leland Hart, Thee Art of Torture is more solid, brutal, and technical than ever before.  The first demo (released in 07 and recorded at Castle Ultimate) displays a uniquely brutal variety and song writing of grindcore at its best.  Playing shows all throughout California, Nevada, New Mexico, and Arizona, Thee Art of Torture has picked up a wide variety of fans.  At the beginning of 2008 Justin McKinney and Leland Hart joined up, bringing their influence into the writing process.  The band had numerous shows in California with the new and improved lineup and have just recently released their newest Demo in summer of 2009 (Recorded, mixed, and mastered by independent audio engineer Marcus Wade).  The demo features the bands original sound with new death metal and melodic aspects.  Thee Art of Torture is a brutal force to be reckoned with.
