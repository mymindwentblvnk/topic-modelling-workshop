Fatal Liquidation was founded out of Orange County, California by Guitarist/Vocalist Jason Dissinger and Drummer Bob "The Animal" Schaffer in 1997. By the end of that year, the additions of bassist Steve Thomas and new drummer Jose Veyna solidified the bands line-up. The Fatal sound consisted of bludgeoning guitar riffs, bloodthirsty bass lines, demonic double bass and pulverizing guttural vocals, all complemented by eerie film samples. While sharing the stage with acts such as Iced Earth and Nevermore, the band rocked Southland venues from 1998-2000. In March of 1999, FL released their critically acclaimed 4 song EP "Surrender Your Soul". Despite a loyal local following and success overseas, creative differences as well as personal issues within the band inevitably caused their Y2K break-up. Over 10 years later, "Surrender Your Soul" has become a cult classic and continues to circulate throughout the underground metal scene. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fatal+Liquidation">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
