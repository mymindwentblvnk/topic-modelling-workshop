The band probably started out in the early 80s in the regions of Stockholm and the only member in the lineup that later would become famous was Johan Langquist who turned up as a singer on the first Candlemass album "Epicus Doomicus Metallicus".

The band did two demos in 1982 and 1984. Lyrics are in Swedish. They also played on RockSM in 1982 (a Swedish rock contest). They didn't win, Europe won it instead. The band carried on up to 1986 when Johan did the incredible vocalwork on the first Candlemass album. After "Epicus.." Johan carried on with Jonah Quizz and other bands up to 1992 when Leif Edling of Candlemass actually called him again and asked if he wanted to replace Messiah. He did one rehearsal but nothing took off...
