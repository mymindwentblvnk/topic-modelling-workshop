Rimini Project is a dance trio based in Austria. The group consists of Sarah K. (born Ester Olaide Ajewole in Paris in 1979), her older brother Sammy B. (born Samuel Oladipo Ajewole in Paris in 1977), and Scandinavia (aka Anna Louise Molander - born in Hudiksvall, Sweden in 1974). 

Rimini Project came about as a result of Sarah K. winning a song contest held at a club in Rimini in 1999. Producer Hubert Rinder approached her after the contest about starting a dance project.
