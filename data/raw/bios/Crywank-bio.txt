Crywank are a two-piece DIY folk band from Manchester, England. They focus mostly on sad songs.

Crywank started in 2009 with Jay Clayton attempting to do some folk-punk influenced acoustic music with no previous experience playing guitar.  The first album "James is going to die soon" was inspired by a painful break up. Jay stated that  "I wrote these songs out of frustration and sadness and they ended up making me feel a lot better, I hope they have a similar effect on you".

In 2012 Crywank released their second album 'Narcissist On The Verge Of A Nervous Breakdown'. Described as "a collection of paranoid songs mostly about me trying to understand my own sadness along with the concept of sadness as a whole. It was fueled by self help books and pot."

In late 2012 Dan Watson joined Crywank on percussion, and in early 2013 they released tour demos for their third album 'Tomorrow Is Nearly Yesterday And Everyday Is Stupid' which was released in October 2013. 

In 2014 Tom  Connolly joined on bass, Crywank is now a full band. Jay continues solo recordings under the name JC and The Nobodies. The name Crywank comes from a nickname a friend gave Jay due to their over-the-top displays of sadness. Their Mum tells her friends they're called 'Tearjerk'. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Crywank">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
