1. Nod has existed since late 1994, and in the beginning it was a foundation consisting of artists, painters and novelists as well as musicians. Nod was created and organized as a religious sect, worshipping art as God. But because of the urbanization of the members, nod has more and more turned out to be a musical project, with Daniel Wihlstrand as the leader. Nod is today a one-man-project and the music is a sort of chaos blended with esoteric introspections.

2. Nod is from the Rochester, New York, area. Active since the early 1990s. (Not to be confused with Nod above). They have been called "omnipunk;" have a loose, unconventional and improvisational style within various genres (rock, jazz, funk, country, folk, psychedelic). Some releases on Steve Shelley's (of Sonic Youth) Smells Like Records Label, as well as Carbon Records (Rochester). Various lineup changes over the years, but core members have remained throughout teure of band: (Scrappy) Joe Sorriero, Guitars, Vocals, Tim Poland, Bass, and Brian Shafer, Drums. (Other instruments include horns, keyboards, and various percussive sounds.) Great live.  Unpredictable, uncategorizable-yet-familiar, original rock. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nod">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
