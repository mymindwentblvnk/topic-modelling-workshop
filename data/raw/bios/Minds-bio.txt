Minds are a defunct power pop/punk rock band. They got sweaty. Members have gone on to form The Flip Tops and Thought Patterns. They released a full length called "Plastic Girls" on Alien Snatch records, and a 7" before breaking up. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Minds">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
