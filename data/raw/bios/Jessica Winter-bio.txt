Jessica Winter is a new musical force to be reckoned with. Holed up in her bedroom studio in Brixton, Jessica began producing her own tracks, taking a magpie approach to all the music she’s encountered in her life. With little more than a cheap microphone, a laptop and a second hand piano, she began to make the songs that would be featured on her debut EP, launching early 2019. It’s a piece of work that smashes the modern beats and lackadaisical vocals of US cloud rap with techno, grime and at least three decades of pop. It’s music to make you feel uncomfortable and provoke serious anxiety in those with a desire to neatly categorise their listening habits.

Jessica sits outside genre, scene or group, defined not by sound but by song. Much of her childhood was spent in isolation, looking out of the window from her hospital bed , from which her vivid imagination grew into a universe. Jessica's inspiration is drawn from robust daily experience and traverses sounds from the 80s, trap, indie, chanteuse and unadulterated pop. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jessica+Winter">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
