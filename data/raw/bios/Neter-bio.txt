NETER was founded by MR & MG in 2004. Initially the band played a mixture of Swedish Death Metal & Thrash. At the beginning some line-up changes happened as usual. From the original line-up MG (guitars/vocals) & MR (drums) are still present nowadays, in fact the solid duo on MR & MG has maintained full of live and illusion this band.

Over a couple of years the band released two demos "A desert way to soul" & "Empty Remembrances" those which was fundamentally a points of experience for the band in all senses.

After the second demo “Empty Remembrances” was recorded the band started to work very hard on writing new stuff, process that has concluded with the recording of his debut album titled “Nec Spe Nec Metu” during summer ’08 at room101 Studio.

The sound & style of NETER has been developed unavoidably since both demos was released until “Nec Spe Nec Metu” but always has maintained it's trademarks and backbone intact: strength groove, murderous but understandable riffing and a dark & modern feeling over the whole music.

Never giving in to trends that came and went in the scene. The band strongly signals a feeling of stand-up, honest, straight forward authenticity to the extreme metal scene, which the band feels is always so important in life as in music.

Nowadays, the band is looking for gigs in order to promote “Nec Spe Nec Metu” as much as possible. We can assure you an uncompromising performance faithful to the intensity of NETER’s music keeping a high quality live sound.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Neter">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
