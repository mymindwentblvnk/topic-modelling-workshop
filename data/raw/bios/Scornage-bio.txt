SCORNAGE from Germany was found back in 1998 and meanwhile they got a great live experience because of their european tours together with Terror Squad (2001) and King´s Evil (2004) from Japan and as well as their live shows with bands like Sodom / Holy Moses / Deicide / Tankard / Crowbar / Hatesphere / Dew Scented / Born From Pain / Ektomorf…just only to name a few. Also they get a great response for their several club and festival shows throughout the years 2004/2005 after their successful release of their album “Sick Of Being Human”.

With the release of the new album “Pure motorized instinct” in Okt. 2006, SCORNAGE will hit the road again several shows in 2006 / 2007.
