Sadistic Sex started out as Negative Youth, who put out a couple of punk demos in 1986-1987. When they changed their name to Sadistic Sex in '88 the music got much heavier and more sinister sounding. They were also full on porn-core at this point. The "What A Waste Of A Beautiful Day" demo is especially crushing. That tape was on constant rotation when i was in art school in Dover around '89 or '90, until i lent it to a friend who had it stolen out of his car. I didn't get to hear this demo again until last year. Sixteen years later and i'm loving it again. The Punk Police would probably cry about the lyrics. Fuck 'em. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/sadistic+sex">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
