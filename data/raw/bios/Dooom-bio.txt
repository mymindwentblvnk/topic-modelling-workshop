DOOOM combines darkness and light in a unique musical brew which spellbinds the listener on the basis of emotional appealing worlds of sound. As a setting of emotions including their positive and negative effects on the human (i.e. happiness and melancholy), DOOOM functions like a mirror of the human psyche. This project is based on the assumption that sounds and musical forms can intensify a frame of mind and enthral the listener deeper and wider. No-one can deny one's emotions and there is no way out, for nobody...DOOOM! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/DOOOM">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
