Swedish death metal band featuring Kristian Niemann and Christofer Johnsson of Therion. The band also consists of Kristian's brother Johan and Rickard Evensand (Chimaira, ex-Soilwork).

Their debut and currently only album, Riders of the Apocalypse, is a concept album partly based on theological and historical elements that circle around the biblical Riders Of The Apocalypse characters.

Johnsson has since departed Demonoid and on 5th October, 2007 a replacement frontman was announced in the shape of Dark Funeral, God Among Insects, Dominion Caligula and ex-Hypocrisy vocalist, Emperor Magus Caligula (aka Masse Broberg). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Demonoid">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
