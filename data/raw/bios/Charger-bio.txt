There is more than one band called Charger:

1) A British sludge metal band from Stoke-on-Trent which formed in 1995. In November 2000, Charger released their debut mini-CD through Undergroove - "The Foul Year of Our Lord", featuring guest vocals from Napalm Death guitarist / vocalist Mitch Harris on the band's most requested song 'Violent Summer'. Since the release, Charger have played the UK and Ireland as much as they could throughout 2001 with the likes of Napalm Death, Morbid Angel, The Dukes of Nothing, Firebird, Sloth and Cathedral. The band split in 2012.

2) Charger was a nwobhm band. They were latecomers to the scene and only released Desperadoes/Are You Out There single in 1987. The single is a rare and collectible item among NWOBHM fans. Furious pace of Charger made them one of more speed metal oriented bands of nwobhm.

3) A punk side project of crust band Depressor.

4) Heavy Metal band featuring Matt Freeman of Rancid/Operation Ivy and  Jason Willer of Jello Biafraâ€™s Guantanamo School of Medicine. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Charger">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
