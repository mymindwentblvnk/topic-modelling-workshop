AU CHAMP DES MORTS started up in August 2014 when Stefan Bayle (ANOREXIA NERVOSA) and Migreich (VULV) first met during an underground festival in France. From the very beginning, the band unveils an extremely assertive personality, forged in analog sound and integrity, deeply rooted in the underground, as well as in the soil of Limousin and Auvergne, and backed up by solid musical foundations, including post black metal, old school black metal, early hard rock and cold wave.
In less than one year, AU CHAMP DES MORTS composed more than one hour of profound and lively music, and when the line-up was completed by the arrival of Wilheim (NEURASTHENIE, EXECUTION) on drums and Cécile G (OLEN’K, ANOREXIA NERVOSA) on bass , the band eventually recorded its first demo in October 2015, and now gets ready to hit the road and record a debut album.
