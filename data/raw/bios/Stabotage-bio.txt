Stabotage started out in the spring of 2004, in the wake of the band Sterile Creeds dismissal. The band recruited Martin Latvala as the drummer, as it moved from a groovy metal-style to a faster, more aggro orientated, thrash style.

Back then the singing duties was handled by Nico Busetincan whose voice is very similar to Entombeds. The band recorded a five-track demo, The Dark Serenades in September of 2004. The demo received great commendations, both in the press, as among others.

The demo resulted in several gigs around the country but in the end of the summer 2005, Nico decided to leave the band as he felt that he didnt have the same ambition the other guys have. So the band started to look for a new singer. They tried of a couple of them and soon settled for Christoffer Forsberg.

Christoffer joined in October of 2005 and the band began to write new material immediately. By the beginning of December the group had completed their second demo, New Birth Encounter, which have recieved much praise by many people. It even got played in the swedish national radio.

In the spring of '06 Stabotage completed material for their third demo. It wound up to be a four track piece, including a cover of Radioheads Street Spirit. The band, soon after the studio visit, went out and did some dates around Sweden through out the summer.

Now they writing new material. This time they'll be puting some money in the production and go record it in one of Sweden's well-known metalstudios.
