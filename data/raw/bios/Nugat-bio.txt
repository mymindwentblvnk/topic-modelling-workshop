There are a lot of things to tell about Nugat. Like how he learned to play four different instruments by himself or his devotion for self- made beats. However, the most important thing of all is the 18 year old student is bent on a career in music.

Nugat experimented around and found his own style which is just as varied as his taste of music: A mix of Hip-Hop, Pop, Electro, Dance and Chill out.
"When im listening to music, I let myself fall completely into the beat. It is important for me that the listeners can relax and feel free while listening to my tracks“.

Furthermore, collaborating with his childhood friend Jannis makes Nugats music unique. 
"When I first listened to one of his songs, I thought 'damn thats nice , I want to record a film to this track!’.
No sooner said than done, Jannis grabbed his camera and the two started a new chapter.
With the release of ‚18‘ , the two reached a whole new level for themselves, not only personally but also musically and visually.

"We travelled across Europe and took shots for the new album. It was a crazy and unforgettable time!", summaries Jannis.

The EP examines the end of a love story but adds a message to always stay optimistic. The end of one chapter and the start of a new. Nugats music speaks more than words could ever achieve, you just have to experience it for yourself. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nugat">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
