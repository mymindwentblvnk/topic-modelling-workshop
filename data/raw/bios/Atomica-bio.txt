Fans of Bjork, Portishead, or any kind of music that's been described as "trip-hop" will be in audio-heaven with this release. "Metropolitan" manages to sound somber without being depressing, intelligent without being pretentious, and relaxing without being boring and forgettable. While the programming and musicianship is top-notch throughout the entire album, Lauren Cheatham is truly the main attraction. Her soft, beautiful voice fits the tone and mood of the songs perfectly.
