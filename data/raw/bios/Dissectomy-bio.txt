There are two bands named Dissectomy. 

Dissectomy (French 2000 - 2004) were a death metal band, releasing only a handful of well composed/recorded demo tracks. The band suffered from a lack of inspiration, thus many of the band members leaving to pursue other projects of their own. (Dissectomy (FR) may not be dead yet, the remaining members are still looking for a drummer, hopefully they can resume working on some new material.)

Dissectomy (Malaysia 2003 - present) are a black metal band who have released an EP 'Tribulation' in 2006, also have featuring on a compilation album 'Burned Alive'  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dissectomy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
