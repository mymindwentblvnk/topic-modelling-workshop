Leather (Leone), Sandy Sledge created a metal band in San Francisco called "Rude Girl" along with Lois LaRue and Morphine Neid.* The story is pretty cool, but too complicated to tell here. Leather went on to sing, record 5 albums, and tour America with Chastain; Sledge drummed and recorded with Fine Print (with singer\TOOL producer Sylvia Massy), Malibu Barbi, Warbride (Lori Linstruth), Rev. Jones (with guest Stephen Perkins of Jane's Addiction), Gary Hempsey, WeaponsVan, etc.; Delphine (Morphine) played bass in The Nuns and died accidentally in '88; Lois played with Addie, played on the Malibu Barbi EP, and then stopped playing.
Leather and Sledge stayed close, stayed alive, and stayed metal.

*Eden Unger played bass after Morphine and was part of the Rude Girl lineup that got the CBS deal. Renata was in the first version of the band with Starr, and Billie and Patti played second guitar for a little while.
