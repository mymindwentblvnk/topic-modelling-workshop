Oddnesse is the soulchild of songwriter-producer Rebeca Arango, a first generation American from Hoboken, New Jersey. Arango met her partner-in-crime, fellow songwriter-producer Grey Goon (aka Doug Walters), in Los Angeles. The two east-coast expats bonded easily over pop hooks and apocalyptic prep while sporting the mandatory black uniform of studio nerds who find solace spending hours inside making music even when itâ€™s very very nice out.

The Oddnesse directive is to construct heavy, harmonious dreamscapes of soaring melodies and simple grooves, pulled freely from a wide range of nostalgic sounds. The project features numerous contributors and collaborators, including musicians Casey Feldman, Eddie Rivera and Lauren Kinney (who all perform in the live band), and designer/art director Dexsy Repuyan. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Oddnesse">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
