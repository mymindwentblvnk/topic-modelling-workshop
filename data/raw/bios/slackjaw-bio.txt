Slackjaw is an unadulterated entertainer. At the age of 17 he took Perth's premier battle competition, Open Mic Combat. His hunger for the microphone was hard to miss, appearing at the revered Hyde Park Mondays with his endless freestyles and memorable live performances. Fast forward to 2006, to the release of "Eat A Rat 1", the first part of his infamous mixtape series. The mixtapes were based around the beats he grew up on, and from here Slackjaw developed a cult following inhis home town of Fremantle. On the search for inspirational beats, Slackjaw turned to local producers Rob Shaker and long time friend Episode. These collaborations would soon become his debut LP "Fremantle's Finest". His music boasts a unique mix of honest lyrics, classy production and a heavy dose of wit and personality. Slackjaw proved his ability by winning WAMI Love Song Of The Year in 2010, for "Take It Slow". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Slackjaw">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
