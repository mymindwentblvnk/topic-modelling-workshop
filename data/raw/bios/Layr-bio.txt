Ripples of a tiny dot that we call planet Earth are resonating throughout the entire universe.

Sounds are emanating from the pulsating, ever-evolving organism that provides our existence. Its fragile equillibrium is countered by its ruthless resilience.

Nature is surrounding you with its destructive force, yet we are forcing destruction upon our natural surroundings.

These themes are dedicated to a place we call home.
