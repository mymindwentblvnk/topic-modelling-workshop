Intelligent soundscapes for looking at the endless void above us. Aphelion is signed to the Alaska based CRL Studios.

11. Now defunct One-man industrial / black noise project from the US. Released an album named Lay on Shadowgraph Records in 2008. From Aphelion's MySpace page: "This sound is the bi-product of living a life being unable to let go of the things that haunt me, things make even the simplest of daily chores difficult. This is what I find at the bottom of every bottle. This is the result of being unhappy with everything around me, of finding the finding the lowest common denominator in everything life has to offer. This is my expressed, projected disappointment with all things and all people, especially myself. This is proof that I am, and always will be the lowest bidder. This is what itâ€™s like to wake up each and every morning fearful of what horrors lay in wait, around each corner, behind every conversation, every casual glance, the meaning, the subtext. This is the soundtrack to my regret, failures and inability to conform to the standards the society holds in such high regard. This is truth, absolute and pure, weighing down on those that bathe in the glory of selfish optimism. This is my wretched desires, lusts and depravity. This is my apathy towards god and a hatred of organized religion, a promise of certainty to the sheep. Aphelion was born of heartache and a disparity that has probably been there my whole life, but it took people, ruined, selfish, cruel and shallow to fully expose it. "

12. Aphelion revolves around the concept of rockstar meets superhero in a Dystopian story of intergalactic proportions. Drawing from a vast and various catalog of musical and theatrical influences, at its core Aphelion is a hard rock band with space-themed lyrics that tell the narrative of a world ravaged by war that was advocated by the greatest threat mankind has ever known: ourselves. The space theme is symbiotically linked into the whole, which addresses tyranny, the casualties of war, and the corruption of man; as well as exploring the emotional connection between each other. They started work on their debut album Chasing the Sun in 2016, and released it in early 2020. https://www.facebook.com/APHELIONgalaxy <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Aphelion">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
