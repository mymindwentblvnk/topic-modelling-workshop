Lena Platonos (Greek: Λένα Πλάτωνος) is a Greek musician, pianist and electronic music composer. She was one of the pioneers in the Greek electronic music scene of the 1980s and remains active until the present day.

She has contributed much to the Greek electronic music scene with mid-1980s records such as Μάσκες ηλίου (Sun Masks, 1984), Γκάλοπ (Gallop, 1985) and Λεπιδόπτερα (Lepidoptera, 1986), which were made exclusively of analog electronic musical instruments and narration of the Greek -and often of her personal- reality.

Songs about immigrants, the absolute power of computers in our daily lives and the hermetic guard of our private spaces give us the image of an artist who worked ahead of her time, with an exceptional talent for conceiving issues that were to conquer our TV screens and newspapers many years later.

Platonos was born in October of 1951 in Crete, Greece and grew up in Athens. She began learning the piano at the age of two and became a professional pianist before turning eighteen. Soon afterwards she received a scholarship and studied in Vienna and Berlin where she was exposed to jazz, rock and middle eastern music. 

She permanently returned to Greece in the late 1970s and began working in the Third Program of ERT radio where she met Μάνος Χατζιδάκις (Manos Hadjidakis) (at the time its director) with whom she kept a close professional and personal relationship until his death.

Her 1981 debut album Σαμποτάζ (Sabotage) was released to critical acclaim for both its lyrical richness and use of synthesizers, at the time not a very common thing in Greek music.

Since then Platonos has released and collaborated on more than 15 albums of mostly electronic music. Her latest record was released in 2018 and is titled Θανάτω Θάνατον...Πατήσας . <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/%CE%9B%CE%AD%CE%BD%CE%B1+%CE%A0%CE%BB%CE%AC%CF%84%CF%89%CE%BD%CE%BF%CF%82">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
