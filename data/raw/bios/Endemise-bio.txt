Endemise formed in 2005 out of Ottawa, Ontario, and after various line-up changes, the band had found its niche with members Dale and David Sauvé, Chris Fayad, Dylan Watts, and Emily Poriere. After a strong series of performances and good marketing success via a self-titled EP, the group parted ways with Emily, and introduced Will McTavish for vocal duties. 

After a few months of continued writing and perfecting, Endemise entered Pebble Studios to record their debut album, Unearth The Throne. Between October 2008 and January 2009, the album was constructed under the guiding hand of producer Mike Bond with mastering assistance from Peter Gilroy. 

In late 2009 the band parted with Dylan and Chris, with Will taking over guitar duties and adding bassist Mitch Harvey. Endemise continues to work on new material, with more textures and broader dynamics, and an overall faster sound than the group’s previous efforts. The band is currently in Pebble Studios working on their second full-length album and seeking label support.
