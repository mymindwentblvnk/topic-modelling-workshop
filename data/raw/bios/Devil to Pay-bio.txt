Formed in early 2002 out of Indianapolis, Indiana, Devil to Pay was conceived as the antithesis of strangulated modern rock radio. With a distinct lean towards 70s heavy metal, a love of proto-grunge, and a deep reverence for the stoner rock and doom metal underground, the band continues to torch its own path to rock and roll glory.

Since their inception, Devil to Pay have won a Battle of the Bands, released three albums, charted on metal radio, toured the country several times, shared the stage with their heroes, and picked up numerous accolades and new friends along the way.
