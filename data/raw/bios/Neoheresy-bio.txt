Neoheresy is a one-man Pagan metal band from Ostrołęka, Poland, which is the brainchild of Filip Mrowiński (AKA L.O.N). The band is a continuation of Mrowiński's previous project Hellveto, who in 2014 decided to change the band's name to Neoheresy. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Neoheresy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
