This group was formed in the autumn of 2000. In the beginning the name of the band was uncertain but at the moment that really didn’t matter. The most important thing was to make up their minds of which role each and one of them should have. Not even their music sounded as it does today. Generally covers were their priority because they wanted to be as good as possible both individually and as a band. 
The start of their own musical composing began during the years 2002-2003. 
Mia (the guitarist) brought some own-written songs and this was the birth of “4-ever“. This episode was also the kick-off as a live-band. The gigs just rolled in and they became more and more accepted, which surprised both them and others with a negative attitude towards “girlgroups“. 
The summer of 2006 a new chapter was written. Matilda (the singer) left the band.
Mia, the previous backvocalist and guitarist, took the role as their new leadsinger.
