The Dead Beginners were formed in 1992 as Autumn Verses by T.Sitomaniemi and E.Lahdenper√§. In 1994 the band recorded a demotape, in 1996 a promotape and in 1997 a debut album, which came out through German Solistitium Records. This particular album got some good response but was spread very poorly. In February/March of 1999 they recorded their second full-length and in January 2000 the third one. Due to problems neither one of these albums were released through Solistitium and therefore the band changed to Finnish Spikefarm Records. It was decided to combine these two albums as one full-length and one Mini-CD.
