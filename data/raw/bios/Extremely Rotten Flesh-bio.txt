ERF was born in 2002 in Pereira, Colombia. The groovy, catchy, yet brutal band's style has been recognized throughout the country and beyond with two promo CDs (2003 & 2004). In 2006, a new improved recording has been done, but no label has signed the band, yet. Headbanging and dense riffs, crushing down-tuned guitars, non-stoppable drum machinery and infrahuman, deep vocals are unleashed by this colombian quartet in such new recording. A must-have for the colombian DM scene worshippers! . <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Extremely+Rotten+Flesh">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
