Formed in 2009, Lunacyst, with the name taken from the words Lunatic (Insanity) and Cyst (Skin Infection) are a four-piece metal band from Riffa, Bahrain. Our style is most easily described as extreme metal, with some death and thrash influences. The line-up and name has kept changing since the birth of the idea of the band in 1999, with various names such as Phat Nutz, Path Under Calm and most recently The Mushroom Massacre. Our influences in metal have also grown heavier and louder since we first got into metal in the 90s. We look forward to making even heavier and better music for all metal-heads around the world so that they can relate to our tunes in some way or another, because that's what Lunacyst is about! 

Lunacyst recorded their first-ever 4 track EP in 2010 and has covered the Bahrain concert scene thoroughly with local as well as international bands such as Sound of Ruby (KSA) and most recently NERVECELL (UAE). Lunacyst have currently finished writing new material for their new full length album and hope to have it recorded and out by the end of 2011. The band tries to put up with the negatives that surround them and continue to make music that will torment your minds! Lunacyst is a Middle-Eastern metal fury to look out for!  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lunacyst">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
