Manic Depressive started off as a Shock Metal band called stitches in 1999 that never got anywhere, but later in 2006 the name was changed to Manic Depressive. And for about 4 years it just remained a 2 man unit of Alice Corpse and Sodomy. The band recorded a couple of demos that werent exactly official, but more like outlines of songs that were written. after awhile the band upgraded and started to use real drums instead of just percussion on inanimant objects. A couple of rehearsal tapes were recorded, and are now kept in the archives..for now atleast. 

In November, 2009 the band reactivated itself with both Alice Corpse, Sodomy and new Keyboard player, Pogo and started practicing again as well as recording demo version of newer and older songs. In January 2010, Bassist Funboy/Mad Butcher joined the band and eventualy autopsy joined on lead guitar to even things out  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Manic+Depressive">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
