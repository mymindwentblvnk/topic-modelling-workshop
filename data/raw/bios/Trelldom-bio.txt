Trelldom was started in Sunnfjord by Gaahl in 1992. After recording the demo Disappearing of the Burning Moon, the full length Til Evighet... was released the year after in 1995. The current line-up for the ten last years has been Gaahl, Sir and Valgard who recorded Til Et Annet... in 1998 and now Til Minne...

Trelldom did never see the need to rush the recording of the Til Minne... album, and in addition there were several reasons that stopped an early release. Some of the material on this recording are dated back to the very beginning of Trelldom in 92, and as on the previous recording, Pytten at Grieghallen Studios is producing the unique expressions that Trelldom represents. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Trelldom">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
