British heavy metal band NEURONSPOILER has been rocking the stage for over a decade and with their new album produced by legendary Grammy award winner FLEMMING RASMUSSEN, the British five-piece look set to conquer the world of heavy metal and beyond.
Rasmussen is the recording mastermind behind the trio of universally acclaimed METALLICA albums; RIDE THE LIGHTNING, MASTER OF PUPPETS and, …AND JUSTICE FOR ALL. 

The band appointed renowned mixing engineer and producer CHARLIE BAUERFEIND to work his magic on the recordings, thereby reuniting the production team behind the landmark BLIND GUARDIAN album "NIGHTFALL IN MIDDLE-EARTH". Bauerfeind has produced and mixed albums for the biggest names in heavy metal including HELLOWEEN, SAXON and HAMMERFALL.

NEURONSPOILER forged their unique brand of steel fully decked out in leather and chains, the way heavy metal was meant to be played. The band’s sound combines the sonic prowess of a classic twin guitar attack, pounding bass and drums with searing vocals. Their honest sound reminds listeners of the greatest bands of the 80s like JUDAS PRIEST, IRON MAIDEN and HELLOWEEN but make no mistake, NEURONSPOILER is no copycat band, but a force to be reckoned with in their own right. 
The band scored a series of successes from the EP NO ONE'S SAFE (2010), the critically acclaimed debut album EMERGENCE (2013) to their debut label release SECOND SIGHT (2017).

NEURONSPOILER received glowing reviews from veteran metal journalist MALCOLM DOME (CLASSIC ROCK) who concluded, “they can really play…there are some truly rich passages of guitar interplay. This alone gives the band a cachet.” In addition, TERRORIZER magazine described the music as, “fast, furious and fabulous.”

NEURONSPOILER can recount some famous faces who have formed part of the audience at their live shows including KK DOWNING (JUDAS PRIEST) and STEVE HARRIS (IRON MAIDEN). 

The band has toured relentlessly for their entire career and has supported or shared the stage with some famous acts like NWOBHM legends GRIM Reaper and DEMON. Neuronspoiler toured the UK with JEFF SCOTT SOTO, and has also supported GLORYHAMMER, KOBRA & THE LOTUS, DENNIS STRATTON as well as NWOBHM pioneers WEAPON. Neuronspoiler has a sizeable following and successfully concluded a 10 city UK tour with former JUDAS PRIEST singer TIM RIPPER OWENS.

Their latest release SPOILED FOR CHOICE will be released independently as the band returns to its independent roots where fans have responded with strong support. An underground favourite, with this latest album NEURONSPOILER makes a bold statement of intent about the future of the band and the future of heavy metal music.
