Lumus is a dark symphonic metal band from Portland, Oregon. Their songs recall otherworldly visions out of myth and literature: a mermaid's tears, a fallen angel's pride, and vengeful gods of Olympus. Their music weaves haunting melodies of voice and violin together with infectious rhythms and a guitar that growls like a hungry black beast.

Jon Lumus founded the band in late 2009 out of need to create darker, heavier music that still challenged his classical training and background. He met drummer Joe Spencer, guitarist Dustin Behm, and bassist Sean McLaughlin in quick succession. Their first single 'The Burning Plain' won a director's award at the Nashville International Song & Lyric Writing Competition 2010. Vocalist Charlotte Camp joined their lineup in 2011, adding her jazz, classical and opera training to the mix. 

Lumus' debut album, Bacchus Curse, will be released on July 11th, 2012. Pre-orders for the physical album, as well as the already available digital version of the album, are available at http://lumus.bandcamp.com. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lumus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
