CIMERIES started his journey as an event organizer and founder of Belarusian music webzines in 2005. Since 2009, he also performed as a DJ with his promo group INDUSTRIAL MADNESS.
In the next three years, CIMERIES took part in 60+ gigs in Belarus, Germany, Poland, Lithuania, and Ukraine. His passion to harsh and uncompromising dance music (rhythmic noise, TBM, EBM, and industrial) led to invitations to such famed industrial/gothic events as Amphi Festival (Germany), Castle Party (Poland) and Kunigunda Lunaria (Lithuania) where he shared the stage with Suicide Commando, Hocico, Front 242, KMFDM, Covenant and many others.
Later, CIMERIES temporally left the decks and focused on his new project BELARUSIAN FREAKZ DESTROY EUROPE dedicated to building the local community and organizing 70+ trips to industrial music festivals in more than 30 European countries.
After a 10-year break and moving to Europe, CIMERIES is coming back with new performances and findings from the modern industrial scene and techno culture. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cimeries">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
