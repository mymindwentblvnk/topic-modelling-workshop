Catch are at least two groups. First, a Danish Euro-Dance group. Their first single "Walk On Water" was released in 2002 and was a #1 hit in Denmark, later the same year they released the single "Keep On (Singing La La)".
An album was planned and recorded, but never released.
Members are Tine Bjerggaard, Peter Buch and Maria Stumbeck.

This could also refer to one of the marvels of late Britpop, a three-piece British band. Their hits included "Bingo", "Dive In", and "Bitten By You". Members include Toby Slater who is now a member of Kunta Kinte, Wayne Murray and Ben Etchells. The latter two subsequently formed Thirteen:13, who have also now split. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Catch">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
