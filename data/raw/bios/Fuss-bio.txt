Fuss is a power trio from Los Angeles featuring vocalist/bassist Bob Vielma (Shinobu, Yulia), guitarist Chase Knobbe (Joyce Manor), and drummer Nick Aguilar (Neighborhood Brats). With an earnest and direct melodicism inspired by J-pop, disco, and 80s British punk, Fuss drop tiny anthems of life after your 20s: trying to keep cool when you feel terrible, working, and continuing to seek out community. Honest and vulnerable, their debut album "Weâ€™re Not Alone" captures the immediacy and uncertainty of the millennial experience: an openhearted yearning felt all the more intensely as the world falls apart around us. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fuss">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
