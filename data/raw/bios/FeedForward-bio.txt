The Dutch band FeedForward has been around for 5 years now, and found its own unique style. This style can best be defined as a mix between progressive rock and melodic metal. However, no classical voice parts, no bombastic choirs. Instead, recognizable vocals and subdued harmonies. Instrumentally, the melodic base is broadened by influences from progressive metal and symphonic rock. In spite of the high level of musicianship and sometimes complex song arrangements, the songs are accessible for a large audience. Key roll in this is female vocalist Bianca. With her clear voice she speaks to the attention of a lot of people, also those which are not familiar with the genre.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/FeedForward">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
