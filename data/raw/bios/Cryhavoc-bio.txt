Cryhavoc was formed in Helsinki, Finland, in the fall of 1992 under the name PREPROPHECY. The band started as classic death metal band with the standard “Florida” sound. During a couple of first years two demos were recorded and they received a couple of reviews in the underground press.

In the summer ´96 the drummer and bass player decided to quit the band. The new players were found soon (both play also in another upcoming Helsinki act Absurdus), and once again the band changed its name to RAVENSFALL.

In the fall of ´96 the band recorded their third demotape, but unluckily for the band, at the same time Absurdus got signed, and the drummer and bass player were not able to continue playing in two bands... again they had two new guys in, and the band changed their name once more, to Cryhavoc.

Cryhavoc entered the Tico-Tico Studio in January 1998 to record their debut album "Sweetbriers" ("wild roses") for Spinefarm Records, who signed a multi-album deal with the band.

Cryhavoc’s second album ”Pitch Black Blues” was released in August –99 in Finland and later all over Europe. In December 1999 their 'Pitch Black Blues'–album was released through Rock Brigade Records and Laser Company Records in South America and there was the whole promo/demo –96 as a bonus track. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cryhavoc">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
