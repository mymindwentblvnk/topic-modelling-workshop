2. Stygian is a Metal/Hard Rock band from the United States of America (Langhorne, Pennsylvania).

Stygian was born in 1999 when Frank, Steve, and Mike met in school. Their first effort as a group was to learn as many Metallica songs as possible. After two years of covering Metallica, while giving their friends a good show, they pulled together their artistic talent and began to write original music.

Stygian wrote, rehearsed, and refined their sound before they launched the new material live. Since then, Stygian has performed in shows all over the Philadelphia area and beyond. With more live shows in the Philadelphia region, people started to take notice, and their fan base grew . . . and keeps growing.

Stygian released their debut album "Struggle" in the fall of 2006, receiving a global response.  They have been discovered by fans in the U.K., Australia, Denmark, Mexico, and beyond. Their live videos showcase their tight playing style, their love for the audience, and dedication to their fans.

Stygian has headlined major venues and opened for national acts like Drowning Pool, SOiL and Symphony X. July 2008 has brought the addition of Patrick Hayden from the now-defunct '454' to take up lead guitar duties. As a result, Stygian is now as complete and solid as ever and have a brand new album on the way with tour plans in the works for 2009.
