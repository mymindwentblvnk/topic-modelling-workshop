Samyaza is an experimental musical project from Casablanca, Morocco. It has originated in early 2007 and has since then released two albums and three EPs through the independent label Yazata Records. Samyaza's first album, "After The Drone", featured simple experimentation with guitar instrumentation constrasting with the chaotic and imprevisible nature of its two first EPs, "A Reportage Of Human Ignorance" and "BHE396". Late 2007 saw the release of another EP, "Virtual Wall of Pain in the Depths of the Ocean", which featured an innovative approach to noise and drone. In December 2007, Samyaza's second LP, named "Remote View of the Invisible", was released. This album's musicality, clearly related to the drone doom musical movement, showed various moods and textures while remaining in a typical drone genre. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Samyaza">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
