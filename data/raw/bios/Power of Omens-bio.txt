Power of Omens was a progressive metal band formed in 1994. They courted some success in the course of their career, most notably with the 2002 album Rooms of Anguish, although Eyes of the Oracle (1998) is still considered by fans to be their greatest artistic statement. the group disbanded in 2006, after issuing the following on their MySpace webpage:

"After nearly 12 years of fighting to survive, Power of Omens has been laid to rest. Due to conflict of interests, lack of heart, and lack of dedication amongst members... it seemed better to finally bring this beast to an end, and put it to sleep than to conitnue forward with a half-hearted attempt. The fans deserved so much more... so much more than what the current line-up was able to deliver.

We owe so much thanks to the many many fans who did support us over the years... because of you, the music will live on forever. Thank you for being there... and giving a bunch of unknown musicians an opportunity to fulfill a few dreams." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Power+of+Omens">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
