The Danish metal band Inimical was established during November 2005 by Peter Wolf Frandsen, Michael Sjøstrøm and Flemming Andersen in Copenhagen. Shortly after the Vocalist Adam Frandsen joined the dynamic team, and it was clear that the first constellation was complete. 

After a couple of months of rehearsal Inimical recorded and released a three track demo "Room no. 13". The demo was recorded in their rehearsal room in only one day and later mixed at Michael Sjøstrøm sound studio. 

In May 2006 guitarist Morten Sørensen joined the deadicated force following the return from a European tour with his former band. Shortly after first Adam then Flemming decided to leave the band, forcing Inimical to cancel concerts and delay studio recordings. The remaining members were determined to curry on, finding new members while writing original, faster and more brutal material. 

During February 2007 Inimical release their next ear-splitting 4 track promo cd "Lamb to the Slaughter". The demo release was given good reviews at metal zines around the world. 

During the summer 2007 Jesper "Bonne" Bonnesen joined Inimical as the new drummer, and only month later Tan Yalin Møhl-Hansen took the role for lead vocals of Inimical. 

Inimical are currently working on the first full-length album - so stay tuned until the evilness is released.
