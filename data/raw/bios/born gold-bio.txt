Born Gold is the high-energy, beat-driven songwriting project of Canadian pop experimentalist Cecil Frena. Caught in an unusual dialogue between future-leaning electronic music, harsh noise and mainstream pop, Born Gold conjures stuttering, blown-out and chopped guitar peals, erratic, bubbling synth arpeggios, sparkling drum machine peals and bursts of meticulously processed digital noise. Oh, and hooks, hooks, hooks.

Born Gold's debut LP Bodysongs, which arrived September 20th, 2011 on Hovercraft / Crash Symbols, is a selected singles compilation of uncompromising and infectious danceable pop anthems. 

In the live context, Born Gold's percolating pop is transformed into something like an ecstatic, surreal, and unsettling dream sequence: bandmates confront the audience in masks, smash shovels together, percuss on hockey helmets and generally get a party started unlike any other.

Born Gold runs with Canadaâ€™s shadowy coven Hovercraft (Purity Ring, Kuhrye-oo).
