GRIND INC. started out as a side project of Hate Factor and Night in Gales members in 2001. The point was to make the most brutal music possible without neglecting groove and having shitloads of fun. Apparently, that worked out just fine and so the project became a real band after some time. Adriano, Jan, Jochen and Chris played some shows together and recorded the first 10-track demo in 2003 called “DEFINED TO KILL”. Media and fan reactions were overwhelmingly positive and so it didn’t take long until the band signed a deal with German MORBID RECORDS in 2004.

“EXECUTED”, the band’s first album was released in May 2005. The CD already sports the band’s infamous dual-vokillz with Tom, who joined the band in 2004, as the second shouter. Some more live shows followed, just to prove that GRIND INC. is a killer live band. In December 2004 the band headed into Cazy’s ezy studios in Krefeld to record their second sonic motherfucker on MORBID RECORDS. The band has managed to improve in all areas and take their music to another level on this album.

"Inhale the Violence" is the last album of the band, released in May 2006 .
