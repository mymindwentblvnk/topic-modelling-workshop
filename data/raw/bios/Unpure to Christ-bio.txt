Extremely heavy sounding Drone/Doom act from Germany. The band seems to make only instrumental music and at this time not that much more is known about them. The band disbanded when only one member was left. He started up a new project to followup on Unpure to Christ under the name of Escape from Flesh. In May 2004 he decided to re-start with Unpure to Christ next to Escape from the Flesh as a solo project, which also saw the return of the other band members later on. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Unpure+To+Christ">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
