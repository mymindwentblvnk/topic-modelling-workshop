HalfNoise is an American alternative rock band from Nashville, Tennessee, USA, Tennessee, formed in 2010. The project was formed as a result of the departure of Zac Farro of Paramore. The project now consists of Farro alone.

History
HalfNoise was created two days after Zac Farro's departure from Paramore, under the original name Tunnel. Zac took part in this new project, along with Jason Clark, releasing a new song called Hide Your Eyes and later on released Free The House, their first official song and music video. The duo then renamed themselves HalfNoise due to other bands being named Tunnel. Farro and Clark had earlier been together in a band with Taylor York and Zac's brother Josh Farro prior to Paramore. Later, in an interview with NME Magazine, Farro said that Clark had abandoned the project and Zac was the only one left. 
On October 2nd 2012, HalfNoise released the first EP, HalfNoise EP.
