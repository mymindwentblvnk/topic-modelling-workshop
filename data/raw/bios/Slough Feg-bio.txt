'The Lord Weird Slough Feg', whose name is derived from a character in the British mythology-inspired Sl√°ine comics, originates from Central Pennsylvania.

The band relocated to San Francisco, California in 1990 in hopes of resurrecting the ailing 'true metal' scene in the United States. The band quickly gained a reputation as, 'The band San Francisco loved to hate' by taking a stand against the trends and incorporating stage savagery with strong visual imagery.

Three demos were produced by the band in the early to mid-nineties. These were followed up by a self-produced, self-titled debut CD released in 1996.

Scoring points for originality in the European underground, they aroused the interest of Dragonheart in 1998 and 'Twilight of the Idols' was released in 1999 on Dragonheart Records. This was followed by, 'Down Among the Deadmen' released in the year 2000, and 'Traveller' in 2003.

The band moved to underground Italian label, Cruz Del Sur in 2005 and shortened their name to simply, 'Slough Feg' with the release of 'Atavism'. 2007 Brought the dawn of 'Hardworlder' which shows the band has no signs of slowing. 

Slough Feg's style is an eclectic mix of Celtic Folk and Traditional Metal peppered with buckets of energy and lyrical depth.
