Meanderthals is a dance collaboration featuring the London-based DJ and production duo Idjut Boys (Dan Tyler and Conrad McConnell) and Norwegian electronica musician Rune Lindbæk. 

Urban dictionary defines Meanderthals as “people who wander around aimlessly and always seem to get in your way in stores and supermarkets, chatting on their cell phones and paying no attention to their surroundings.” 

The trio worked throughout 2008, recording live in their London and Oslo studios, calling in the talents of Pete Z, Des Morgan, Per Martinsen (AKA Mental Overdrive) and more throughout the undoubtedly Balearic-tinged proceedings. They are described as a “blend of dub, folk, prog, kraut, psychedelia and 70s west-coast”. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Meanderthals">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
