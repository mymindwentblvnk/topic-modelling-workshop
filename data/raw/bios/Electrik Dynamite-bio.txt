Electrik Dynamite is a Melbourne born metal band.

"There once was a time where 'heavy metal' was not about how low your tuning was, how brutal your vocals were or how much double kick action the drummer could belt out. Once upon a time, heavy metal encompassed more - the passion, the conviction, belief in the god of metal... oh, and the hair! That time was the 80's. 6 souls were born from the wombs of 80's heavy metal, these 6 souls are Electrik Dynamite!

With songs that transcend the course of two decades of music, epic harmonies, unforgettable melodies, 80's keyboard flavoured pop hooks with a totally modern 'don't give a fuck' attitude, wrapped in an explosive live package of feel good fun and timeless rock-god stage moves, Electrik Dynamite are jumpin' in their F-14 Eagles (See: Top Gun, the movie) and settin' their sights on electrifying the masses."

Line-up consists of 6 members who all have their own personal stage names; Maverick (vocals), Merlin (guitar), Slider (drums), Cougar (keyboards), Hollywood (guitar) and Ice (bass).
