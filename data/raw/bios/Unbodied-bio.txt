Unbodied is a new metal band from Ohio that draws influence from many different sub-genres of metal (death metal, sludge, grindcore, thrash, progressive, and stoner metal) which has enabled them to create a unique, heavily dynamic sound all their own. The trio has just released their self-titled debut EP and is working on material for a subsequent EP to be recorded/released later this year.

— Vince Neilstein, MetalSucks

"The new seed of sick metal."

"...a sludgy-pulling-you-down-into-the-muck sound while at the same time sounding bright and technical...Unbodied seem to know what they are about and have themselves in order"
— George Washburn, Rock Music Critic

"...spastic, grindy sludge metal with good drumming and hardcore/metalcore growling vocals...the music is solid, and it might serve as a good bridge for Ohio kids to get into the better side of metal."
— Kelly Hoffart, Full Metal Attorney
