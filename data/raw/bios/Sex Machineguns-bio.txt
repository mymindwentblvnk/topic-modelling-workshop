Sex Machineguns are a Japanese heavy metal band formed in 1989 as an indie group. They intentionally chose a name similar to the punk band Sex Pistols, and as the band puts it, "machineguns are more radical than pistols". They released their first commercial single and album in 1998, achieving major success and playing 62 completely sold-out gigs.

Sex Machineguns play a very bass-heavy form of metal, similar to what is often called heavy metal (which is also how they refer to themselves). Their songs tend to be filled with extremely fast guitar and bass solos, which differentiates them from traditional heavy metal and brings them closer to the realm of speed metal. The band rides an image of being "shock rockers" by wearing crazy, exotic outfits often worn by visual kei bands, singing about blowing up restaurants (see the song ファミレス・ボンバー, ( Family Restaurant Bomber) - from their album Sex Machinegun - 1998) and naming one of their live DVDs "SM Show" in a very intentional allusion to BDSM. Casting themselves as shock rockers is not the prime selling point of their music though, as they also exhibit technical virtuosic skill on their instruments.

In 2007 the band reformed with two new members, releasing albums  Cameron  and  45°↗ in 2008 and 2009 respectively.

As of this update, the most recent albums seems to have been  Metal Monster  (2015) and  Iron Soul  (2018). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/SEX+MACHINEGUNS">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
