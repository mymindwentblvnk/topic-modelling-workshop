AT NIGHT I FLY has been founded by well known members of the Hungarian progressive music scene.

Singer Zoltán ‘BZ’ BÁTKY was the member of Stonehenge, a band that gained highly positive feedback in Hungary and abroad, but his most known group is After Crying, a cult-name for the progressive-contemporary fans all over the world. He has been the founder of the award-winning modern metal band Wendigo, worked with legendary producer Beau Hill on H.A.R.D.‘s Traveler album, and also singing in a Queen tribute band.

Guitarist András Ádám HORVÁTH is the main songwriter and leader of Dreyelands: the band have released its debut album at the Finnish label Lion Music. He is also producing and co-producing other bands’ albums.

Drummer Gábor NAGYGYÖRGY has been a member of the quality instrumental trio K3: their albums were critically acclaimed, with guest performances from musicians like Jordan Rudess of Dream Theater.

Bassist Zoltán HEGYALJAI-BOROS is a multi-talented musician: he is playing the viola in many classical and contemporary productions, but also plays the bass in a group called Reason, and also the guitars in many projects.

After two years of planning, AT NIGHT I FLY has come to life in 2012, to start working on its debut EP. The songs have been released in the very beginning of November. Then the band will start playing concerts in Hungary and abroad to promote its modern progressive style.
