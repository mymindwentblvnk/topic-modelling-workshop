The Modernettes were a popular punk band that formed in Vancouver around 1980. Members of the trio were guitarist John "Buck Cherry" Armstrong, bassist Mary Jo Kopechne, and drummer John "Jughead" McAdams. All of the members added vocals to the performances. Many music critics described the group's songs as somewhat of a mixture of the Velvets and the Ramones.

In 1980, the Modernettes recorded the debut EP Strictly Confidential. It was released under the Quintessence Records label. A second EP, Teen City, followed quickly. The sophomore carries six tunes, including "Suicide Club," "Little Girls," "Celebrity Crackup," and the band's strongest and probably most popular song, "Barbara." Though the group pulled together a strong following, true success seemed to stay at least two steps ahead of the members.

The Modernettes only completed one album, Get It Straight. The full-length offering carries 20 tunes. John Armstrong, known during his Modernettes days as Buck Cherry, went on to perform with other groups, and to put together his own home studio. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Modernettes">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
