Technical Deathmetal band from United Kingdom
Ageless Oblivion are a 5 piece modern Death Metal band from Hampshire UK.  Fusing together the brutality of Nile with the Morbid Angel worship seen by the likes of Gojira, their music also incorporates the sprawling, epic soundscapes of bands like Mogwai and Cult Of Luna and a heavy sprinkling of Doom soaked riffs that would please even the most elitist of listeners.

With a lyrical concept focusing around the disturbing strength of human potential and mankind's inner potential, their debut album 'Temples Of Transcendent Evolution' released through Siege Of Amida Records (Annotations Of An Autopsy, Ingested, Diskreet, Dyscarnate) features a concrete heavy production by Chris Fielding (Dyscarnate, Napalm Death, Electric Wizard), and mastering by Tim Turan (Opeth, Ingested, Emperor).
