"Bruma" has it's origins in a old death-metal project called "Daemonastery". It didn't have any gigs,remaining solely a studio project. Before reaching the present line'up,Bruma went through numerous changes,both member and style-wise,reaching an equilibrium. Bruma's music has developed organically,it being a combination of all the member's musical preferences and aspirations,a colage of musical genres,however pretentious it may sound :)..
