2. Antony Milton and Stefan Neville (aka Pumice)sized each other up down state highway one for ages. They sent packages. They played together for the first time as guests in The Futurians. The second time was years later (2004?) and it was called SUNKEN. Their debut was a self titled cdr on PseudoArcana. US label  Last Visible Dog has been good to us with compilation tracks on both "The Invisible Pyramid" and'Crows of the World'.
Two new releases are in the pipeline, a CD on PseudoArcana and a cdr of live shows on Corps-Morts Records.
