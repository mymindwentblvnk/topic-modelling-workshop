Stagnant Pools is a two-piece shoegaze/post-punk band from Bloomington, Indiana. The duo consists of brothers Douglass and Bryan Enas. Bryan and Douglass create a wall of sound that is both grooving and aethereal. Brian's reserved vocals emanate just below the level of noise that is created by the combination of fuzzed-out guitar and on-point drum beats in such a way that they sometime register as a very in-place hum that adds to the overall sound. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Stagnant+Pools">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
