Thraeol ('thray-ol') is instrumental metal with shreddy guitar solos and silly song titles.  Born from a passion for seven string guitar, a fascination with geeky subjects and too much sci-fi reading as a child.  

The sound falls somewhere along the melodic death metal / instrumental shred continuum; being shreddier than most death metal, but riffier than most instrumental shred albums.

Thraeol is based in Cape Town, South Africa, its online home is http://thraeol.bandcamp.com <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Thraeol">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
