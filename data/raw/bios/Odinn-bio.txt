Odinn comes from a small island just off the southcoast of Iceland.At a young age he started to play the guitar.But several years later (2003) he bought his first drumkit and started to play in bands and explore more his talent as a musician.Former drummer for the symphonic black/death metal band Stillbirth,the viking rock band Thorshamrar and the brutal death metal act called Bastard he begun to make a name for himself in the Icelandic underground metal scene.
Also worth a mentoin he picked the bass for a short time with Perfect Disorder but they played somekind of a punkish rock n roll.
Odinn has received alot of praise around the world for his music and the music he has done with other bands through the last couple of years and only recenly released his first demo cd......hopefully more to come...sooner than later.
