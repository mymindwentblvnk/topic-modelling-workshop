Formed in 2007 in Simi Valley, CA, Back From Death began making music with former members of AOH.  They had left their old band feeling that it wasn't making music that they would listen to.  So they started jamming together and writing more brutal music with complex song structures under the name of Embalmed, though that soon changed again and again until they settled on Back From Death.  They have gone through many different members throughout the years and currently have, Regurgitate (Bass and Vocals), Rambro (Guitar), Wayne (Guitar), and Timpaled (Drums).  Right now they are writing and recording for their first official demo entitled Enslaving the Dead.  Soon after they will be doing more shows. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Back+from+Death">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
