The Vanishing was a trio from San Francisco, California active from 2001-2005 who mixed deathrock with synths, effected sax, and mesmerizing vocals. Jessie Evans  (vocals, bass, sax) was the former saxophonist/ bassist/ vocalist of the infamous all girl deathrock group Subtonix, and member of the electronic sax duo Autonervous. Fellow Vanishing member Brian Hock (drums, also Zonetech) formed the group in 2001 with Sadie Shaw (keyboards 2001-02 and currently of The Husbands). They released a 10" EP, a full length album and a split single with Lost Sounds. Later Sadie quit the band and was replaced by Billy Bates (Zonetech) on synth and bass (2002-2003).

In 2004 Jessie and Brian moved to Berlin and became a duo for the next year, touring around Europe and playing mostly improvised sets. Thematically the group wrote songs about love, media, and sexual politics. They broke up in 2005.

Jessie Evans is currently working on her first solo record and playing live shows with a drummer named Toby Dammit (Iggy Pop, Swans). Brian Hock and Billy Bates are currently doing a project called C.L.A.W.S. Sadie Shaw continues in The Husbands. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Vanishing">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
