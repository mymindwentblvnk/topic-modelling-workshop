Meek (with various capitalisations) is the name of more than one artist:

1) MeeK with a capital K (see also his separate profile Pop Artist MeeK is a British-French indie pop songwriter who has become a bit of a "cult-artist" over the years and he's one of the first european artists to have used the Internet as a marketing tool and a media to expose his music to the general public, long before the advent of MySpace, Facebook and the likes. He's a self taught guitarist, pianist, arranger and producer. He sings in both French and English. His music is melodic and his tunes are often conceived around multi-layered vocal harmonies. His lyrics tend to be somewhat surreal, very ironic with a lot of double-entendre, trippy distorted imagery and words seldom used in pop lyrics. The Meek Sound is a genuine blend of acoustic instruments, sophisticated vocal harmonies and this rather high-pitched and almost childlike voice of his.
