School of Language is a pseudonym of Field Music's David Brewis. The album Sea From Shore was released during Field Music's break from band activities in 2008. A second record, Old Fears, was released in April 2014. 45, a concept album heavily inspired by the then-current American political climate was released in May 2019.

Brewis also released a five-track EP, I Could Have Loved U Better,  on the four-year anniversary of Prince's death (April 2020), who was the primary musical inspiration for the work. 

All School of Language albums were self-produced at Field Music's studio in Sunderland in the north-east of England. The EP was produced in Brewis's home during a lockdown phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/School+Of+Language">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
