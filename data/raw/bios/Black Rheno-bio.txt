Hailing from Sydney, Australia, spitting out hot and catchy chunks of stoner, sludge, grind, punk and doom are rising, in your face, heavy act, Black Rheno. Formed in August 2015, the boys have wasted no time in kicking up dust and making a name for themselves. They’ve toured relentlessly up and down the east coast, receiving airplay on triple J and featured on Australia’s Heavy Mag compilation all within a few short months.

The band draws inspiration and influence from acts like Red Fang, Kyuss, King Parrot, Clutch, Snot, Superjoint Ritual, Iron Reagan and Fu Manchu, but its been evident from the outset they’re creating their own unique and unmatched heavy hitting style. Black Rheno thrives on a solid work ethic and development of their craft. This unrelenting approach has seen them draw a loyal fan base since their inception onto the live scene in late 2015.

A new single entitled “No Time For Numb Nuts” will be released in August 2016 with a video and extensive east coast tour throughout August to support it. November 2016 will see the band release their highly anticipated debut EP, followed by a full national tour to round out the year. Black Rheno are an unstoppable band of brothers set on making a mark in the Australian scene. Their hell raising live show, commanding stage presence and bone crushing anthems are kicking down doors for the band already, and nothing seems capable of stopping them……….
