History of the group began in February 2004.  After leaving the group Abordage, player Dmitry "Zell" Zolontsova and Roman "Meats" Myasnikov found the bassist Koryanov Oleg.  They played music with elements of death/thrash and started performing concerts as they prepared to record a first album.  But on September 30, 2004, Roman Myasnikov died.  Zell and Oleg went into a deep sadness. 

After a long break, they found a drummer: hopeless erotomaniac Grigoriev Alexey.  Around this time the group started to play a brutal death metal style.  Leushin Nikita came along as a new bass player, and Oleg took the role of second guitarist.  They continued to play concerts in and around Moscow.  In the spring of 2005, CREMATED LIVES recorded the concert "Beginning of Bloody Feast" and the video "Going to Vladimir."

During the fall of 2005, obsessive fan of his instrument, Sukhanov Roman, joined to replace Oleg and Nikita.  The group became known in the Moscow area and recorded their first album "Bloodluster".
