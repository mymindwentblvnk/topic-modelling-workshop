Tales Of Evening is a Hungarian melodic metal band formed at the beginning of 2011. The idea came from the band's keyboardist. He would have liked to hear his own instrumental, film music, atmospheric songs in another guise, so he recruited musicians who also like this genre. The team thus formed with specific plans and determination, so they began to record the songs in the studio, played in a completely different style.
The band's strange name came from that the bit abstracted and sometimes fabolous lyrics can mean different things to each man, but everyone can find itself in it. Like in a fairy tale...

The band's first studio album, Hajléktalan lélek, was released on September 6, 2012.

Ivett Dudás - lead vocal
