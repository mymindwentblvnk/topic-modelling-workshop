There is more than one group with this name.

1. Chronicle is the next evolution in the revolution of new Soul Reggae music. And out of the quiet corner of the US, Portland, Oregon; they are on the rise.

Taking a cue from great Roots players such as Bob Marley and Toots Hibbert, they do a service to the music that many American Reggae bands fail to attain. Their music is seamlessly transient from Roots Soul into glimpses of the future sound of Reggae delivered with the intensity of Dancehall, the spaciousness of Dub and the grace of Roots music. Led by a vocalist who may be the one of the most talented this genre has seen in some time, this group is poised to take the lead on the cutting edge of a new wave of future Roots straight from the west coast.

Beginning a new effort in 2010, Chronicle has updated their line-up and music with new players and the change has proven to be a local hit; sharing the stage with Steel Pulse, Clinton Fearon, Natural Vibrations, Anthony B, Alborosie, and Papa Michigan in this year so far.

This Summer, Chronicle will be on tour promoting their new album "Coming Up, Volume I" 7 tracks of brand new Reggae produced by the band with the help of Old Dominion (the underground NW HipHop crew) alum and leader of Headlock Muzak, Pale Soul.
