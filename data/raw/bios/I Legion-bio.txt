What is I LEGION ?

 I Legion is the musical work of Frederic Riverin, who shaped and wrote all the songs in fall 2011, at his home in Quebec. Helped by friend producer and vocalist Chris Clancy (Mutiny Within), they both crafted these recordings into a melodic metal machine. Metal monsters Bjorn Strid (Soilwork), Jon Howard (Threat Signal) and Chris himself took the vocal duties and put their melodies and talent over the 12 songs of the album.

 I Legion also features modern guitar heroes Andy James (Sacred Mother Tongue), Peter Wichers (Soilwork), Angel Vivaldi and Brandon Jacobs (Mutiny Within) on the lead guitars for tasteful and melodic solos.

 All these musicians helped Frederic to create his own album: alone, but with a legion behind him. The I LEGION. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/I+Legion">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
