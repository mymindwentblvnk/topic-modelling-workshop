Few artists have managed to cultivate name and brand recognition quite like Belgium native, bass music icon, Michael Bella. His cutting edge, high-energy basslines, and masterwork song structures stimulate the senses, complimented by 100% original artwork that ties his unmistakable branding together under his DJ & Producer alias, Eptic.

At an early age Eptic found not only a love for Rock & Metal, but Drum & Bass - the inspiration
behind him wanting to learn and produce himself at a mere fourteen years old. Laying the
creative fundamentals down at such a young age has paved the way for the now well-known
international bass enthusiast, gaining the respect and attention from, and ultimately collaborating with, many well known artists such as DJ Snake, Marshmello, Dillon Francis, Jauz, Juicy J, among others. 

Equally known for both his music, off-stage comedy skits, and social media personality, Eptic has secured acclaim far outreaching the bass music community proving there’s no boundaries for the Eptic moniker. With the debut of his fabled “Overlord Stage” at the end of 2021, Bella gave us a thrilling glimpse of what’s in store for 2022. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Eptic">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
