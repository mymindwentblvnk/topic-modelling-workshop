Nigerian born and London raised, Seun "S.O." Otukpe is no stranger to rap. A love for hip-hop was birthed in him from a young age, saying his first rhyme at 6 years old at his grandmother's birthday party. But even with this love, he did not dream of doing music. Upon coming to Christ in 2004, at age 15 his focus changed from wanting fortune and fame, to serving and pleasing God.

After years of the Lord working on his soul, and S.O. working on his craft, a gospel-centered artist was formed. In 2010, S.O. accomplished both a degree in Theology from Durham University, and a mixtape offering called "The 5 Solas Mixtape". It was an encouraging contribution to the soul and to the ear, and one that caught the ear of Lamp Mode Recordings.

In 2011, Lamp Mode Recordings signed S.O. as their first international artist. Currently, both parties are excited about the future, and hopeful in the Lord's sustaining and providential grace to spread the fame of Christ. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/S.O.">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
