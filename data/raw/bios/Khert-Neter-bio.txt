Introduction to the history of Khert-Neter.

- During the years 1996 and 1997, some forms of death metal ideas begin to emerge and the early version of KHERT-NETER is created by Tommi Havo.

- At the end of the 90's, while playing in several Lappeenranta based bands, Tommi Havo, Jyri Vahvanen and Gorthaur record a couple of demos under the name of KALMISTO. This is not meant to be anything more than a "not so serious side project".

- Soon after the recordings, a Greek label ISO666 offers to release those tapes as a long play cd and Tommi decides to chance the name of the band trough the ancient Egyptian concept to KHERT-NETER. In 2000 "Arrival of the Funeral Dogs" is released in the underground metal scene.

- Gorthaur quits the band and Tommi takes in Enrico Huovinen, a very skilled drummer and a band mate from a local dark metal band.

- 2001 KHERT-NETER arrives at Music-Bros studios to record six of their new songs to mcd-format. The recording is used only for promotion and is never released. Afterwards Jyri Vahvanen leaves KHERT-NETER and is replaced by lead guitarist instead of a bass player. Vesa Kääpä joins the band and gives a fresh approach to KHERT-NETER's music.

- 2002 Anssi Mäkinen is added to the line-up to handle the low frequencies and KHERT-NETER arrives again at Music-Bros studios. They release a three song promo cd in a very small scale and again, the recording has no effect on record companies.

- KHERT-NETER starts training at a remote location and continues to improve their skills on all levels. Soon they enjoy the new found passion, strength and precision.

- Lars Holm, a graphic designer who previously worked with the band's art and photos, is introduced as a singer and frontman in KHERT-NETER.

- The band starts to work on an album on their own and "Images of Khepri" is recorded in the beginning of 2005. Vesa Kääpä and Tommi Havo produce, engineer and mix the recording in a very old school manner. Neither computers nor digital manipulation is used in capturing the live, natural sound that is KHERT-NETER.

- Finally, KHERT-NETER PRODUCTIONS is formed to introduce the album to the public and independent, at last, KHERT-NETER starts to rise from the shadows of their invisible past.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Khert-Neter">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
