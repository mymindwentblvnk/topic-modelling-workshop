Started out in the summer of 2009 with the hard hitting sounds of thrash, twists of extreme metal and Classic heavy metal vibes all molded in the spirit of rock n roll . We’re blindfolded to the trends around us and write what ever comes naturally. The meaning behind the band name is ” Intelligently creating destruction and chaos” and we plan on putting that in your face when it comes to live performances. Our demo feed them bullets is available for streaming and download here on facebook . “GET WRECKED” to the tunes and don’t be shy to lose your minds at our future shows.
