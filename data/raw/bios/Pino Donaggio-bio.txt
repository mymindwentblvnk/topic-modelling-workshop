Pino Donaggio (born 24 November 1941) is a composer from Burano, Italy.

Donaggio began playing violin at the age of ten, studied at the Benedetto Marcello Conservatory in Venice and the Giuseppe Verdi Conservatory in Milan, and was performing recitals at the age of 14. Donaggio made his film music debut in 1973, writing the score for Nicolas Roeg's classic thriller Don't Look Now.

Since then he has worked on many films, including Dario Argento's Trauma and Due occhi diabolici. He works regularly with US director Brian De Palma, scoring De Palma's Carrie (1976), Home Movies (1979), Dressed to Kill (1980), Blow Out (1981), Body Double (1984), Raising Cain (1992), and the forthcoming Toyer. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pino+Donaggio">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
