The idea for the band Hell Inc. was created by guitarist Sebastian, Patrick and Dani (who played in Errorbrain before). Since Dani left the country for a bit, to travel London, Wales and Finland, Sebastian and Patrick (guitarists) started the band with Michi (drums) and Gerdi (vocals). Dani (bass) joined in later, when he came back from Helsinki, just 3 days before their first gig.

After a few months in our rehearsal rooms we're just recording our first demo with the songs we wrote. It will be out sometime soon. Taking care of live gigs is what we do now.
