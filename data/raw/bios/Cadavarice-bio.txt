Cadavarice
Pronunciation: \kə-ˈda-vər-rəs\
Function: Noun
Etymology: Latin, from cadere to fall, Middle English, from Anglo-French, from Latin avaritia, from avarus avaricious, from avēre to crave.
: Corpse greed, to crave dead bodies, insatiable desire to gain corpses.

Cadavarice was started by Bob and Caligulare in late 2009, when both had a burning desire to play oldschool death metal.

The name came about many years before, by Caligulare, which had sparked something inside of Bob. He got an idea for a story based around the name "Cadavarice" and began to frantically pen down his ideas. These ideas slowly formed into a graphic and detailed horror/sci-fi story that the Cadavarice band is based upon. 

After spending six months writing riffs, Bob then recruited local Citrus Occultist, Lyman Sinister on drums and local newbie, Meedles on lead guitar. 

Our goal is simple; bring back oldschool death metal, drink beer, and have fun. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cadavarice">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
