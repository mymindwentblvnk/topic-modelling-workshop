20 year old, Matt Mulheran finally creates his very first Beat-Tape. He is on a mission to become a prominent producer in the Twin Cities Underground Hip- Hop scene. Since being drawn to Hip-Hop by the jazz infused music of A Tribe Called Quest, Matt, operating under the name of Diatonic, has continually pushed to create a new breed of Hip-Hop. The D.J./ producer/ audio engineer is currently enrolled In the Bachelor's Degree for Recording Technology at McNally Smith College of Music. Primarily influenced by Hip-Hop pioneers 9th wonder, J.Dilla, and Pete Rock, Diatonic poses a sharp contrast to the today's mainstream Hip-Hop by rejuvenating classic songs and creating lively soulful Hip-Hop instrumentals. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Diatonic">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
