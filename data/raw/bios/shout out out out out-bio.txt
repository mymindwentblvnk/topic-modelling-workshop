Shout Out Out Out Out = two drummers + four bass players + two samplers + five synthesizers + five cowbells (synthesized for live shows) + two octapads + one vocoder. Shout Out Out Out Out plays volatile dance music.

Hailing from Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, Shout Out Out Out Out is made up of nrmls wlcm label bosses Nik Kozub and Jason Troock, whitey houston members Lyle Bell and Gravy, sketchy casanova Will Zimmerman, and a lil' spazz named Clint Frazier. They are a live spectacle, leaving jaws dropped and dance floors filled with their chaotic blend of epic bumpin'. Hell yes, let us do the electro rock and dance the night away. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Shout+Out+Out+Out+Out">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
