The delta mirror is Craig Gordon and Letdown aka David Bolt. The two started out as a hip hop duet in the early 90's and have been making music in some form ever since. With the addition of Karrie K on bass, their sound has progressed to an ambient mix of shoegazy guitar and gothic vocals, but their production has held onto the same boom bap button pushing they started with. Machines That Listen is The Delta Mirror's debut long play. Each song on this 9 track collection is a story that takes place in a different room in a hospital. You can find it on itunes, cdbaby or at Amoeba records in Hollywood.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Delta+Mirror">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
