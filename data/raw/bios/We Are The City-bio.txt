We Are The City is a Canadian progressive rock band based in Vancouver, British Columbia, that formed in 2008 in Kelowna, British Columbia. The current band members include singer-keyboardist Cayne McKenzie, drummer Andrew Huculiak, and guitarist David Menzel. 

The band earned accolades for its atmospheric progressive-pop sound on their 2009 debut LP In a Quiet World. In January 2010, the band won the PEAK Performance Project, a "battle of the bands" contest hosted by Vancouver's 100.5 The PEAK.

The trio of Cayne McKenzie (vocals/keyboard), Andrew Huculiak (drums) and David Menzel (guitar) released six songs entitled High School, the result of an experiment that began as a side project during some down time in the summer of 2010. High School was originally envisioned as a fictional band, with the members tying shirts over their faces and adopting aliases in order to disguise their identities. Cayne was Lindsey Jone. Andrew was Matthew Curran. Blake was Bobby Reynolds. The project gave the band a chance to revisit their teenage years, laying bare some shameful memories from their past. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/We+Are+The+City">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
