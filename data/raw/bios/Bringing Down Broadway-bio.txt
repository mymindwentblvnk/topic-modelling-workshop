Formerly known as Gauge, Bringing Down Broadway is a metalcore band from Lapeer, Michigan.  Their album "It's All Gone South" was released via Wounded Records on October 2nd, 2007.

Excerpt from Amazon.com's product description:

"Relentless and melodic. Pounding and infectious. Raw with smooth edges. These are the sounds of Bringing Down Broadway. Is it metal? Yes. Is it hardcore? Sure. Is it grind? At times. Because of the bandâ€™s songwriting, arrangement and work ethic, Bringing Down Broadway rank among the best bands in the aforementioned genres. This is for fans already rocking to Underoath and With Blood Comes Cleansing."

Excerpt from Highwire Daze Magazine:

"With influences ranging from Underoath to In Flames and beyond, This Michigan-based outfit has toured all across the nation several times, bringing their spirited brand of metallic energy to the masses.

It's All Gone South has captured their compelling presence in the studio, presenting ten shimmering tracks (plus intro) of sonic artistry that will dazzle the senses. Combining a stirring collection of lyrics with a frenetic soundscape that is nothing short of mesmerizing Bringing Down Broadway will surely obliterate the metalcore scene with their anthem-like collection of tunes.

Take a chance on these guys and prepare to be absolutely impressed! Expect this band to soar to greater heights, as 'It's All Gone South' is destined to send Bringing Down Broadway into the stratosphere. An important band we'll be hearing a lot more from in the future.

Ken Morton - Highwire Daze"
