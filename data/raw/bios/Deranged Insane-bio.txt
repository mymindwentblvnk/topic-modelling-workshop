Deranged Insane appears in july 2000, with the proposal to do a simple Grind/Noisecore, fast and dirty, in short, without smuffy.
Formation was, Kiko (vox, drums) and Cynthia (guitar, vox). In February 2001 they move to Japan ,doing a few gigs.
Two years later, invite Takemae, Zaghio Evha Dilejg's member, a japanese Noisecore band to assume the vocals. After this become more united and play more gigs. Then the sound become a little bit work, but keep velocity and agressivity always.
In august 2004,they return to Brazil , without Takemae and looking for a substitute. Fernando Carcaça join the band. With this formation they play two gigs in hometown Londrina .
Now Kid replaces Carcaça and this the actual formation.
