Sentiment was founded in 1998 by Jami and Tony Huovinen. They first aproached the music with a progressive angle, but after couple of demos and numerous bandmember changes, the present form of Sentiment was reached.

With bass player Wille Terämä and singer Michael Henneken in the crew, Sentiment has moved to a new musical era. They released a promotional cd in the begin of 2004, called "Breaking The Chains", which has received a lot of praise in the media.

Sentiment's present musical style can be described as melodic metal, with a twist of hardrock and crunchier riffs. Their goal in writing songs is simply good melodies that can reach listeners both in- and outside of metal genre, though never forgeting their roots. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sentiment">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
