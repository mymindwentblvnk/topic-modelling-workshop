Scott Murphy is an American musician from Chicago, Illinois and the former bassist for the pop punk band Allister. He is currently a solo artist active in Japan.

In 2006, Allister released the album "Guilty Pleasures" in Japan featuring various covers of Japanese pop songs, due to Scott Murphy's affinity for J-pop music. After the break-up of Allister in 2007, Murphy recorded and released the solo EP "Guilty Pleasures II" in Japan, followed by Japanese television show appearances and performances before releasing "Guilty Pleasures 3" in late 2008.
