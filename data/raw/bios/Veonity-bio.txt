Created in the late 2012, Veonity is a power metal band hailing from Sweden. Back then the band consisted of Sköld, Samweli, Lidre and Dahlqvist, but after a long search for a vocalist De Silva joined the lineup, in the early spring of 2013, and the band became complete.

Just a few weeks after the band's completion, Veonity headed into the studio in March 2013 to record their first Demo/Ep "Live Forever", which was finished in the end of summer/early autumn the same year.

Vocals: De Silva
