Matt Winson is a Dutch/Latvian indie folk band from Leiden, Netherlands.

The band initially was a collaboration between singer/songwriter Matthijs Steur and multi-instrumentalist Pieter van Winsen. They began performing together in bars and on the streets. In 2012, the guys made a two-month roadtrip across the United States. Accompanied by a guitar and a banjo, they made their way through the country. Searching for a richer and more dynamic sound, the band expanded with drummer Thomas van Winsen and in late 2014 with Latvian trumpet player Magnuss BauÄ£is. Gradually, the band has developed a distinctive sound built around vocal harmonies and a wide range of instruments. Matt Winson creates accessible, progressive folk music while also including elements of other genres such as jazz and electronic music. Throughout the years the band has performed at venues such as Tivoli and Gebr. de Nobel. Currently Matt Winson is writing new songs and recording along with producers Brian Esselbrugge and Maikel Warmerdam. On the 9th of July, 2015, they released their first EP Glowing Eyes with a sold out show at Gebr. de Nobel in Leiden.
