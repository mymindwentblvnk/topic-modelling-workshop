BIOGRAGRAPY
What started as a bunch of teenage San Diegan Slayer/Manowar fans writing songs about Skelator taking over the world has turned into a bunch of 20 something year old Rainbow/Sabbath fans writing songs about their favorite fantasy books.  The band has stayed true to itself through the years writing epic songs, and rock anthems.  We are not a joke, but we also know how to have fun.  Bands that take themselves too seriously bore us.  But bands that don't play from the heart should be destroyed, this is our decree.
