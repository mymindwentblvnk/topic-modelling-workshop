Human Shield is an Italian thrash metal band influenced by historical bands from the 80's and the 90's .
The band, initially named “Nemesi”, was formed in 2001 in Pompiano (near Brescia, Italy) by  Claudio De Maria (drums) and Matteo Olivini (guitar). Once it had a complete lineup, the band started playing gigs in local venues and music events.

The first demo, consisting of 5 original tracks, was released in 2003 and received good press both on Metal Shock Italian magazine (July 2004 issue) and on several metal webzines.

After some lineup changes, in 2006 the band recorded a new song,  Cry of rising, which was subsequently released on two different metal compilations: First Act, issued by Noise Studio in Gussago (BS - Italy) and Underground, produced in Lituania and distributed worldwide.   

In August 2007, following the formation of the present lineup, which includes along the founders Davide Badinelli (bass), Herbert Brunelli (guitar) and Daniele Gatti (vocals), the band choose the new moniker Human Shield.

The band's creative efforts culminated in an EP named Human Shield, recorded in March, 2008 and currently being distributed. The CD includes 4 tracks, which style combines typical 80's Bay Area Thrash elements with modern and personal ideas.
