Stoned Jesus is a Ukrainian band from Kyiv, Ukraine that emerged in 2009 as Igor Sydorenko's Krobak side-project, dealing with the heavier and darker side of rock music. Beginning with sludge/post-metal blueprints, it shaped into a full-time band, becoming musically closer to stoner rock and traditional doom metal in vein of early Black Sabbath, later days Electric Wizard and classic Sleep.

After releasing their debut First Communion record and playing dozens of gigs in Ukraine and Russian Federation, the band went through a lineup change and released a new EP entitled Stormy Monday on April 7, 2011.
