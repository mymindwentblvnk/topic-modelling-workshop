(1) Fogg, prodigal young proto-metal trio out of Fort Worth, TX worshipping at the Temple of the Holy Riff, FOGG busts out of the gates with a blistering LP of lead-heavy psych. “DEATH” sounds as if Black Sabbath took a handful of psychedelics, locked themselves in a garage, played ‘till their fingers bled and – to our benefit – remembered to hit “record”.

Fans of Blue Cheer or Pentagram’s “First Daze Here” comps will find much to love here, as FOGG’s relentless riffing will have you wondering if this was actually recorded in 1971.
