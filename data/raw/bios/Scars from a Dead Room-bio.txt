Scars From A Dead Room are a mysterious Canadian project that release their debut on the equally mysterious but unique French label Distant Voices. Behind this name is hiding one man, alone on board and armed with darkness and despair. From the endless canadian winter, Scars From a Dead Room build a misanthropic and inner vision of the outside world, resulting in a black, oppressive and raw metal. This 8-tracks piece designs the first deflagration of SFADRâ€™s sound approach, between philosophical thought and feral instinct. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Scars+From+A+Dead+Room">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
