Atmospheric Melodic Metal from Bangor, Maine (also known as Derry to Stephen King readers) Shadow Liege is the side project of Shadar Logoth vocalist/guitarist Daniel Eaton. More European sounding than American, Shadow Liege is for fans of Type O Negative, Amorphis, Moonspell, Vintersorg, Borknagar, Lacuna Coil, Wongraven, The Gathering, My Dying Bride, Arcturus, Peccatum, etc. The mission is to take you out of the everyday and bring you somewhere more mystical and majestic. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Shadow+liege">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
