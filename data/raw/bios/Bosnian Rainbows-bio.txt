Bosnian Rainbows are an American alternative rock band from El Paso, Texas, formed in 2012. The band consists of The Mars Volta members, Omar Rodriguez Lopez (guitar, backing vocals, keys) and Deantoni Parks (drums, keys), alongside the enigmatic Le Butcherettes vocalist Teri Gender Bender, and Nick Kasper (keyboards, synths) from the group KUDU.  Initially billed as a variation on the Omar Rodriguez Lopez Group, the band was formed following a decision to put Rodriguez Lopez' and Parks' primary project, The Mars Volta, into a hiatus.

Regarding the band's influences and aesthetic, Rodriguez Lopez noted, "These are very much shorter, more to-the-point songs than The Mars Volta's. They still have spaces that stretch out, but what I mean to say is that it's all the same influences that have been in most of my writing and all the people in my bands' writing. Can is there, Siouxsie and the Banshees is there, Gang Of Four is there, all the Led Zeppelin, whatever... all those things are there, it's just different elements of those things. You make it shorter. It's stripped down, it's starker. The very melodic side of Can; the very textural side of Siouxsie. You take all those elements, and you take elements that maybe you weren't exploring as much before." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bosnian+Rainbows">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
