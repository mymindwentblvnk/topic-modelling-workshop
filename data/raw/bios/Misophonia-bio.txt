BIO
Misophonia was founded in 2009 by Hamed Golchin (IIIrd Alternative) and Jens Moss (Diamond Drive, SlingShotsuck) and started out as a collaborative studio project between the two but in 2012 a full line up was established.
The danish progressive metal act Misophonia explores the limits within modern metal and combines groovy riffs, polyrythmic patterns, catchy melodies and ambient soundscapes in a skullcrushing cocktail. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Misophonia">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
