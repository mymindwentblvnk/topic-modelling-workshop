Formed in Alkmaar in the year 2002, Mantikhoras makes a blend of several music styles in completion of their compositions. Inspired by lifetime facts as misunderstanding, loss of love or even suicide, the mixture can best be described as symphonic rock/metal.

The inspiration also finds the way to lyrical expression as the same emotional themes are put into words. Considering the fact that the vocal lines of sadness are metaphors for actual events.


With two promos finished, Mantikhoras’ discography consists already of ‘The Constructor’ which was released in 2003, ‘Alkmaars Trots’ (the album, presented by all brothers and sisters in arms from around Alkmaar) released in 2005.
And the third album: ‘Joust of Destiny’, was also released in 2005.
