In 2006 BUTTERFLY COMA formed up to create uncompromisingly heavy, but yet multi-layered melodic music, beyond stale Metalcore stereotypes. Six blooded musicians now establish a musical massif of various styles of Metal and Hardcore.

BUTTERFLY COMA’s music stands out with it’s cutting aggressive guitar riffs, paired with catchy melodies which are borne by several voice vocals and spherical keyboards. The driving drum rhythms and grooving bass lines along with the brute shouting of the singer form the backbone of the songs. The blend gets flavored with cutting-edge scratches and samples. 

After taking adequate time for songwriting, rehearsals and debut live shows BUTTERFLY COMA recorded their first selftitled Demo. The songs were produced by keyboarder Benny (producer of the latest CALIBAN album) and got mixed and mastered by Jacob Bredahl (Hatesphere) at Hard & Smart Studios, Denmark. In addition BUTTERFLY COMA recently shot their first music-video at Europa Park, Rust. The Video clip is directed by US-singer Marc Terenzi. The visual highlight of the video is official Miss Germany Nelly Marie Bojahr playing the star role. The material is going through post production right now, but we put together a little trailer to promote the forthcoming video.
