The band plays on stage as a unique experience performance, giving a lot of attention on strobe lights and atmospheric effects, a massive wall of sound and suggestive video projections for visuals.

The project was born in 2007 as a four pieces death/progressive band. After an year, in 2008 they went in studio to record their first EP called "Atman EP", which was self produced and published in limited edition of a hundred, a unique and different artwork for every copy, containing 4 tracks for a total lenght of 37'14'' of music. After the release, in 2009 the quartet started the live activity to support the EP, playing gigs with band like The Ocean, Ahab, In Mourning, Black Sun Aeon and more. In 2010 the band placed 4th to the most important unsigned band contest "Wacken Metal Battle" , and after that they started to create a more complex and different kind of music, becoming a six-pieces Post/Progressive beast. In late 2011, the band entered the studio to record the debut album, a concept called "Samaroid Dioramas", engineered at Studio 73 by Riccardo Pasini <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sunpocrisy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
