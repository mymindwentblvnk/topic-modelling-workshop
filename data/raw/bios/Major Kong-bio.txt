Major Kong is an instrumental stoner / doom metal band from Lublin, Poland. Formed in 2010, initially as a side project alongside their parent band - Fifty Foot Woman. Kong’s music is inspired by Black Sabbath, Pink Floyd, combined with old horror and sci-fi movies. It’s based on simplicity, solid groove and basement atmosphere.
