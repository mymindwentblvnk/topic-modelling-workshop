As a self sufficient ‘do-it-yourself’ metal/hardcore band Deterrence has made a name for themselves in their hometown of Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, as well as throughout the U.S.A.

The West coast, East coast, New England, and Midwest, as well as southern Ontario and Quebec have all experienced the intense live show of the four piece act. They have consistently toured since 2009 and have sold hundreds of t-shirts, CD’s, pins, sweatshirts, and other merchandise.

Their latest ep release “Good Luck Hate,” is a heavy, fast, unique, and catchy work of musicianship. The first single “You Are Worthless And Weak” generated over a thousand YouTube views soon after its release.
