There are two bands called Austaras:

I. Austaras was formed by J. Becker and S. Hill in autumn 2008 and first performed live in late 2010. As of summer 2011 they have released their debut EP 'Under the Abysmal Light', and have been playing a number of live shows in the Chicago area. Moving into 2012, they are working on new material that plans to showcase an evolution from their debut by use of new elements, sounds, and ideas that will coalesce into the first Austaras full-length.
