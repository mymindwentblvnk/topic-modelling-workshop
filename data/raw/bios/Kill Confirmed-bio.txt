Formed at North Hertfordshire College in Hitchin 2011, the band consisted initially of two halves; Sian Farrell and the Savage brothers (Joe and Tommy) required a second guitarist and drummer to complete their line up, and Dave Ward and Reece Fowell required a bass player and singer to complete theirs. After several mutual jam sessions together, playing covers of similar favourite bands, the two halves tied the knot and became a single band unit.
In 2012, the band got its first gig in October and their second in November after writing 3 original tracks.
Due to creative differences and unreliability, ex vocalist Sian Farrell left the band, leaving it as a four-man band.
Lead guitarist Joe Savage then took on the role as lead vocalist with Tommy Savage on backing, prompting the band's sound to move towards a heavier sound, scrapping one of the original songs and writing 4 brand new tracks together.
The new line up restarted their name early in 2013, becoming more popularly known locally for the new vocals and new songs. They recorded 2 demo tracks while in the last year of college using the college's basic studio for free.
Currently they are working on a short, fully mastered EP ready for release in 2014, including a re-recording of the demo "Descend". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kill+Confirmed">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
