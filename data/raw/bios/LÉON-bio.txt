LÉON is the stage name of Lotta Lindgren, a Swedish singer-songwriter from Stockholm, Sweden. Lotta’s parents come from a musical background - her mother is a seasoned cellist in the symphony and her father is the conductor/composer. With a background like this, her own transition into music was inevitable.

For the past year, LÉON and Swedish producer, Agrin Rahmani, have been developing a strong body of work, the first taste of which we heard on "Tired Of Talking", her debut single. In 2018. In the buildup toward her debut album, LÉON scored another hit with it's rousing single, "You and I" the album, simply titled LÉON, appeared in March 2019, followed by tours of Europe and North America.

In October 2020, she returned with her sophomore album, "Apart". Recorded in Stockholm with longtime collaborator Martin Stilling, the album found LÉON continuing to build on her mellow, melodic pop sound. "Circles", her third full-length album, arrived in March 2022. Inluded on the album were the previously released singles, "Dancer, "Soaked, and "Wishful Thinking". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/L%C3%A9on">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
