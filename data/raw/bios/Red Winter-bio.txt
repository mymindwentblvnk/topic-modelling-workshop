Red Winter is a Liverpool based Punk Rock band founded in late 2012, by original members Ian French, Glynn Hislop, Joe Norton, and Matt Tyrrell. Matt and Glynn came together on a guitar level playing covers, with Joe brought in to cover vocals. After a while they started to write original music, with Ian French brought in on drums, and together they wrote ‘No More’. Phil Ryan was brought in as a second guitarist to bulk up the sound but in late 2013, the band parted ways with Glynn. The quartet that remained began gigging in February 2014 at The Lomax to a busy crowd.
The band began making a name for themselves at the turn of summer 2014, but all progress was stopped when Ian told the band he was leaving. It was at this point while looking for a permanent drummer, Red Winter looked to good friend Chris Carr (honorary member for life, he’ll fucking hate we’ve made a big deal), he’s been massively important in Red Winter, helping us tick over, and redefine a sound that today the band is very proud of!
In October 2014, Chris Jones joined as a guitarist, and at the end of November 2014, Greg Finnan completed the band, joining as the man behind the skins. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Red+Winter">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
