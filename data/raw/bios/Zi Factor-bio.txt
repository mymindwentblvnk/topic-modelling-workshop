It began way back in the 90's in Hawaii. The brothers Ezra & Eddy both guitarist looking for their own style explored the sound of Indonesian ethnic music in metal. But after a long twisted life it was in Indonesia that they got together to form Zi Factor. It was 2002, the idea was a band that talks honestly of bitterness,hope & life here.The music had gotta be Indonesian metal. Not just another metal band from Indonesia. We call our music Tribal Core. After a couple years playing without permanent members,helped out by Tyo who never knew he could growl, they met up Bopaq, a growler. And then in 2005 Iwan a real vocalist with 3 previous band albums join the band. This is the first time Zi Factor got solid as a real band,plus Bopaq's brother, Uya the bassist who believed in the mission. We started recording our debut mini album 'Kill paradigm' with 7 songs 1 bonus guitar shit in early 2006 at Eddy's bedroom. Agus our drummer, joined later in Dec 2006,he resign from the band in 2007 . In early 2008 Adans joined the band as additional drummer. The band is a total d.i.y band. All recording, mixing & mastering, video, website, enhanced DVDs & CDs, contents, artwork, covers etc were all done by the band & our team of creative misfits. We are releasing the album under our own self-created label, Unsound Records, in a joint-venture with PRS/SonyBmg Indonesia for local distribution in november 2007. Unsound Records is also looking for labels out there preferably metal or indie oriented to release Zi Factor outside of Indonesia. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Zi+Factor">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
