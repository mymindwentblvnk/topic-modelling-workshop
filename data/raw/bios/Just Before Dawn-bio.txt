Old School Death Metal band created from the wartorn mind of Anders Biazzi (Blood Mortized, ex-Amon Amarth) and some friends from bands like Puteraeon, Zombification, Revel in Flesh and Godhate. The band follows closely in the footsteps of war obsessed death metal acts like Bolt Thrower and Hail Of Bullets. Complete destruction guaranteed. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Just+Before+Dawn">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
