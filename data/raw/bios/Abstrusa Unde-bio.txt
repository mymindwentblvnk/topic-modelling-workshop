Founded in 2007 by Thibault, Abstrusa Unde's project is the result of a quest for several musical styles integration into a single entity. "Orfeo", the group's first album, to be released early 2009, is the first step of this research, and the musical adventure of his 9 musicians, Thibault (drums) Matthieu (keyboards), Fred (guitar), Alexis (bass), CÃ©line (cello), Diane and Clemence(violin), Augustin and Perrine (vocals). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Abstrusa+Unde">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
