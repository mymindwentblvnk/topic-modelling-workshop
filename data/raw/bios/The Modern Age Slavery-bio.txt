Their debut album "Damned to Blindness" has been released on 28th November 2008 on Napalm Records and confirms that which has made The Modern Age Slavery infamous in the underground scene by delivering a relentless Deathcore debut that takes no prisoners.

"Damned to Blindness" has been taken to live form with 40+ shows in the first half of 2009, all across Italy and Switzerland supporting bands like Vomitory, Origin, Textures, Brutal Truth and Brujeria.
