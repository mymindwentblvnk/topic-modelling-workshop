There is more than one artist called Mastiff.

1. Mastiff was formed in 2010 and their Myspace biography states "Formed from the remains of a string of successful local bands, who finally had enough of the over saturated scene full of posers trying to claim the throne. Hardcore is our life and we live it. What we play is true balls out hard, fast aggressive beat down hardcore that you can bounce to and two step Until you drop. We have come to rip the scene a fresh new arsehole and inject some life into a dying and decaying sound. Coming from a range of influences ranging from the traditional N.Y sound to the more modern styling of metalcore. Were a unit now and are finally playing the music we love for the hardcore community. MASTIFF one life to riff all day every day! Get some motherfuckers!"
