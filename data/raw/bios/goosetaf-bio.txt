Goosetaf is a Seattle-based lo-fi music producer with an expansive and evolving sound. With each release, he emerges with his own signature style, mixing old school hip-hop with his modern beat palette. The result is a plethora of instrumentals, calming and atmospheric.   In 2018, the 24-year-old beat maker released three solo albums, three solo EPs, a collaborative EP with Allem Iverson, a split single with Bertholet, and various loose instrumentals. He maintained this pace in 2019, dropping half a dozen singles, numerous collaborative projects (with Oatmello, Timothy Infinite, and G Mills), and a solo EP, Migration, through Chillhop Records. Drawing inspiration from artists such as Flying Lotus, Erik Arc Elliot, Madlib, Kiefer, and Yoko Kanno, Goosetaf’s prolific and wordless discography can provide the vibes for your next pool party, moonlight cruise, or relaxed evening spent inside.   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/goosetaf">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
