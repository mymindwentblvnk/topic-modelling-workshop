Universe217 were formed back in 2005 in Athens, Greece, as a quartet (guitar, bass, drums and female vocals). Their music can be described as down tempo rock.

Universe217 is one of the most vibrant heavy acts in Greece nowadays, with lots of gigs across the country and steadily frequent record releases. The band’s impressive performance on stage (whether it’s live shows with other Greek bands, festival slots or supporting international artists like Amenra, Anathema, Madder Mortem, Om, Saint Vitus, Scott Kelly, Wovenhand, Karma To Burn etc) has earned them an excellent reputation as a live act.

Up to now, the band has released 3 full-length CDs, “Universe217” (2007), “Familiar Places” (2011), and “Never” (2013), one EP, called “II” (2009) and a 7’’ vinyl split-single with Lucky Funeral (2009).

U217 like to have a "hands on" attitude when it comes to their award acclaimed videos & artwork which are made by them. Even recording and mixing sessions are done by them.
