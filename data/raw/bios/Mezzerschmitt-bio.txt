Mezzerschmitt is a Norwegian black metal band. It was formed in 2000 by Jan Axel Blomberg and Rune Erickson, both members of Mayhem and Lars SÃ¸rensen from Red Harvest. They intended to create an industrial metal band but their sound shifted toward black metal but still incorporated industrial elements. They have released only one EP so far, Weltherschaft.

The band was incorrectly associated with supporting Nazi ideologies due to the image of the band which resembles with Nazi-Germany's uniforms, symbol use etc. Blasphemer stated that Welherschaft is an imaginary place created in his mind, and the purpose of the band is to let out steam and is non-political. But Jan Axel has admitted that he has some unpolitical views on this term. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mezzerschmitt">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
