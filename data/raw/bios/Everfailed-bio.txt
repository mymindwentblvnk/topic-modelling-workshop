EVERFAILED is a death metal band with influences from Swedish death metal and thash-hard-math-core sounds.Founded in 2007 in Chania-Greece."
there have been lots of gigs since then and some of them with major bands.There have also been some mini tours in Greece.
in 2010 they recorded their first e.p. "biological order" witch was self released and produced and has taken some great reviews so far.
In general,this band has been working hard since their first gig and will continue like that for long.
They have time on their side since most of them are really young and know what they want to do
.At the moment the band is preparing their second release,hopefully under some label,but if not they can also promote it really well by themselves like they have done so far.
Also there have been plans for a tour over europe and their first video clip.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Everfailed">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
