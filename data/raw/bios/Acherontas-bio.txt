Acherontas is an occult black metal band from Greece, previously know as Stutthof. Contrary to popular belief, neither Acherontas nor Stutthof were NS bands - Stutthof's name was taken from that of a Nazi concentration camp in Poland, but NS ideology does not appear or play a significant part in the lyrics or meanings of songs by either band. Acherontas is focused solely on the mysticism of the left-hand path.
