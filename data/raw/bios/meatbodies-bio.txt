Chad Ubovich spent the last few years as a member of Ty Segall and Mikal Cronin's respective backing bands. Along the way, he's learned to put his personal spin on the surf-strum mutant beach party championed by California psychedelic rock bands like Thee Oh Sees, Wand and Bleached.

As Meatbodies, Ubovich's lessons pay off. Listening to the band, fans of Segall and his coterie will no doubt find similarities â€” the obvious nods to '60s dream-time dementia, cultish lyrical enticements, the cartoonish narcissism of glam rock, the positioning of an acoustic guitar against heaps of fuzz and delay. That's fine. People don't expect a revelation in rock 'n' roll so much as they demand a good time. But Ubovich finds ways to differentiate his music, and in doing so gets to have it both ways. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Meatbodies">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
