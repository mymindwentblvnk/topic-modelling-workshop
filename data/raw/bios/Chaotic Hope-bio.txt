CHAOTIC HOPE was established as a group in winter 1997, with the purpose of creating obscure music of high quality, and avoiding mediocrity as well as the commercial influence of the actual scene.

Through all these years, the group has stabilized, and the style has been polished until concluding in an epic black metal with excellent pagan melodies, a brutal rythmic section, fast and sharp guitars, alternated black atmospheres and all of it splattered with some death metal influences. The lyrics enveloped the music of dark passages, cruel battles, pagan rituals and arcane fears.

The first recording of the band was done in the beginning of 1999; It was a demo-rehearsal with the following themes: “Usurper”, “Oceanus”, “Chaotic Kingdom”and “Darkness Falls Soon”. It was not put to sale due to a poor sound quality; even so, it receives good critiques in specialized fanzines and catched the attention of various record labels. However, no satisfactory agreement wass reached forCHAOTIC HOPE.

The firs official edition of the group saw the light in November 2000; the MCD “Lunar Winds ” with the themes: “I, The Wanderer”, “Oceanus ”, “Beyond The Gloomy Summits of Oblivion” and “Black Wings”. The sound as well as the presentation are both of high quality.

The promotion was massive in fanzines, radios, record labels, etc., and it was accompanied by concerts all around the Spanish geography presenting its anthems to the dark art.

Chaotic Hope have recently recorded its first full-length CD “Graveyard of the Human Spirit”. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Chaotic+Hope">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
