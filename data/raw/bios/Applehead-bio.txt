There three Artist with the name "Applehead"

1) Following the unresolved 'Applehead De Applehead' LP, Tony DeVal expands the semi-fictitious Applehead mythology on Andy Votel and Demdike Stare's first label cassette. Mixed at Villa Scott using only original European vinyl pressings, the 'Crepaxian Interligne' mixtape nods to the psychedelic eroticism of Guido Crepax's comics and the soundtracks of '80s Spanish and Italian horror films in typically enigmatic and inexplicable fashion. We couldn't tell you the names of any tracks, even if we wanted to (you wouldn't want Applehead on your case either, would you?), but these are the sort of cryptic sounds which conjure images of vulpine murderesses, sharp-suited sleuths, overacting obese gang bosses and the sort of more explicit blueness that would have the Daily Mail belling the BBFC. These are sounds you've probably never heard before, but they'll take you right back to 1984, alone in your bedroom watching badly dubbed and outrageous foreign "muck". Right up our alley, then!

2) Applehead is a solo side project of the Crucified guitarist Greg Minier, who also released a disc under the name Minier. Applehead released one album, "Meaning" on Ocean Records in 1992.

3) Mayutan is a pink and fluffy being, accidentally touching down on earth after a journey gone wrong through outer space. But don't be taken in by a cute story, this electro-fur pop ensemble has real bite. Fascinated by 80s new-wave (Devo and YMO), applehead are also into and part of today's techno pop scene operating out of the electro zone of Akihabara. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Applehead">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
