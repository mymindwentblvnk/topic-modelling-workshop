Death metal band from Pittsburg, California (USA).Formed in  2010.

Originally formed by Michael who started with his drum machine and wrote both Biohazard and The Outsider. Then Joey Banducci soon joined on drums and they stayed as a two piece 4 months then gained Josh on bass and Clayton Cagle on guitar. This line up lasted till March of 2011 and Clayton was let go from the band. By this time the band was beginning to do shows more often and had began to develop... their sound. For a short time Jimmy Hill of Necrosin had joined for a short time, but wanted to put his priorities toward Necrosin and quit. Hemotoxin continued as a 3 piece and by this time had already released two demos and travelled to LA. After staying a 3 piece, young Hunter Farrand had offered his talents and was added to the band. Then in mid September after forming and being in the band for over a year, Joey quit and very soon after Brandon Wilcox filled his spot and has now become a very vital part of this band. Now you have the band as it is now, still very active. In February of 2012 Hemotoxin released their latest release Divinity in Torture and play many shows all around the San Francisco bay area!
