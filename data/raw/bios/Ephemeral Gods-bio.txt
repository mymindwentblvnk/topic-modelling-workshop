Ephemeral Gods, formed in 2009  in Ahrweiler, RLP, Germany   formerly known as No Merzy is a Thrash Metal Quintett which incorporates the spirit of such oldschool Thrash-Metal bands as  Annihilator,  Metallica  and Anthrax but with a more modern approach.
Starting as No Merzy in 2005 they appeared at many regional gigs in the Area around Ahrweiler and Bonn and recorded a few demo tracks. However the lineup has changed almost completely leaving Martin, Alexander Schr. and Thomas as the only founding members. With the new name Ephemeral Gods they are now about to record a whole new LP and to do a larger tour across Southern Germany.

The current line-up consists of :

Lars S.               -    vocals
Martin Sch.         -    drums
Alexander Sch.   -    guitars
Thomas K.         -    guitars
Alexander Schr.  -    bass <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ephemeral+Gods">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
