Alvvays is a dreampop band formed in Toronto, Canada in 2011.

Reverb-drenched and bittersweet, Alvvays members Molly Rankin and Kerri MacLellan were childhood friends, who began playing music with Alec O'Hanley while in high school.  Lead vocalist Molly Rankin is the daughter of John Morris Rankin from the popular Canadian folk family group the Rankin Family. Molly Rankin released a solo EP titled "She EP" in 2010 and then in 2011 formed Alvvays with MacLellan, O'Hanley, and new members Brian Murphy and Phil MacIsaac.

Following tours with The Pains of Being Pure at Heart and Peter Bjorn and John, the group recorded a full-length album, Alvvays, which was released by Royal Mountain Records (Canada), Polyvinyl Records (US), and Transgressive Records (Europe) in July 2014.  Chad VanGaalen, John Agnello, and Graham Walsh of Holy Fuck all contributed to the album's production.  Simon Vozick-Levinson, writing in Rolling Stone, called the eponymous album an "indie-pop wonder".  Alvvays went to #1 on US college charts on August 5, 2014. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Alvvays">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
