A group from Lyon, France, formed in 1997. The band mixes hip hop with drum & bass, rock, dub, jungle, jazz and trip hop.
They are famous for their hypnotizing live acts. 

After 2 albums "triple 000+" and "P.H. Test Two" ( 100 000 copies together), Le Peuple de l'Herbe came back in early 2005 with their much awaited third album "Cube".  This is their first work featuring British rapper JC001 as full band member, after prior collaborations as MC and with his former band UK Apache. A new evolution for a band created by 2 hip hop and jungle oriented DJ's, later joined by a trumpet player and a rock drummer for a more organic sound.

Using their live experience ( more than 300 gigs all over Europe in 5 years), it's in their own studio - The Supadope factory in Lyon (France) - that they recorded "Cube". Their latest album was released November 2006 and is called "Radio Blood Money". Combining their passion for hip-hop, electro, dub and rock, the music of " Le Peuple" reaches a new dimension mixing high energy, distinc grooves, unconventional melodies, elegance and thier legendary fun and party attitude.
