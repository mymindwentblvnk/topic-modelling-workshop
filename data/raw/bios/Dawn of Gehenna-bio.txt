Dawn of Gehenna was founded on the ashes of Estonia's (probably) first doom metal band Mystique, active in the late 80s. By the year 1993 only the drummer Aiku had remained from the original line-up. Not willing to turn from the chosen path, he put together a new death-doom combo comprised mainly of the members of Predatory War and Mortified. After the recording of a rehearsal demo in early 1994 the band was renamed Dawn of Gehenna. The first official and, for over a decade, the only material released by the band was recorded in 1994 in an 8-track studio in Pärnu. After a number of gigs around Estonia and one in Latvia the lead guitarist chose to quit and the band began to slowly sink into oblivion around the end of the 90s, only to be furiously reanimated in 2003 for an under-underground event Laitse Rock. Soon after DOG opened for the Finnish saviors of doom Reverend Bizarre. Having canted their style towards more traditional old school doom rock, the band gave a few more gigs, incidentally opening in May 2004 for Nightwish at their exclusive tour-opening event in Tallinn.

In November of 2005, Dawn of Gehenna spawned a sub-band called Taak that plays the same music, only all in Estonian. Dawn of Gehenna continues - with English lyrics. In a way the songs "I, Atlantis" and "Of Stars and Dust" are the demo of Dawn of Gehenna, while the Estonian part now serves as introduction to Taak.

In spring of 2007, some of the material from Taak's "Koerapööriöö" sessions was remixed on analogue technology which, combined with freshly recorded English lyrics, resulted in a promo/demo CD-R "Doom Enclave". About 200 copies were freely distributed to the curious at the Roadburn 2007 festival in Tilburg, Holland. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dawn+Of+Gehenna">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
