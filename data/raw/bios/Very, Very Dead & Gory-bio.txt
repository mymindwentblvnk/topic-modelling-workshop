Australian death metal/grindcore band from Melbourne, Victoria, formed in 1991 as Xenophobe. In 1992 they became Very, Very Dead & Gory, releasing a live demo the same year. From February to March 1994 they recorded their only studio album, "A Veritable Paragon of Wholesome Family Entertainment", which was released later the same year. The band was made of Ben (bass, currently a member of Malichor and Spine of God, ex-Anarazel, ex-Portrayal), David Cohen (drums, ex-Portrayal), Arti (guitars) and Callum Wilson (vocals, ex-Portrayal, ex-Blood Duster, ex-Solemn Assembly). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Very,+Very+Dead+&+Gory">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
