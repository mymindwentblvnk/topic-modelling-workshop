Statement:

Our music is a mixture of electronic and acoustic instruments and inspired by everything we think is worth being influenced and inspired by. We focus on feeling and harmonies with the intention to deliver a mellow and relaxing atmosphere. In short, Insolvent is not for parties or happy occasions. It's for people who likes to sit down, relax and listen to music through headphones.


We do not believe in a magic hit-formula for making "great" music. The goal is to make music that we like. If you have opinions and feedback we're glad to hear it, but it changes nothing. If you want to listen to what you would call a great song by your standards then we recommend you write it and record it yourself.
Our plans for the future is to find a label that is willing to take a chance on something that's not MTV'd for clueless people who think music is a hot chick/guy that will date them if they buy the CD. We're looking for someone who still believes that music is an artform rather then a product for the masses <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Insolvent">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
