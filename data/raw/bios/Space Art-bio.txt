Space Art is a French band that was formed by two friends in Paris in 1977. The group consisted of Dominique Perrier on keyboards and Roger Rizzitelli on drums. Their first (self-titled) of three albums was released in the same year as Jean-Michel Jarre’s, “Oxygene.” Knowledgeable Jarre fans will recognize the names, because both went along on the 1981 China tour. Dominique Perrier has since played keyboards on most Jarre albums and live performances and is sometimes credited with artistic collaboration - small wonder, as their styles are very much compatible. But as this and the other albums show, Space Art is not a mere clone and has a distinctive style of its own. This is due in large part to the heavy drums very well employed by Roger Rizzitelli (highly inspired by bands such as Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Soft Machine, etc). It was all about experimenting with new sounds on new machines. They specialize in a certain set of highly tragic/dramatic chords which appear on all their best tracks, a perfect example being the title-track. Apart from ‘Onyx’, the other tracks that really stand out are ‘Axus’ (an astonishing sonic explosion), and ‘Laser En Novembre’ (the most experimental track). A 3 CD box set will be released in ’08 including SPACE ART (1977), TRIP IN THE HEAD CENTER (1978) and PLAY BACK (1980). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Space+Art">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
