Agonizing Terror were formed in Aveiro in 1993 with the name Pain Possessed. The following year they changed name to Obnoxious Odium and, later, to the final Agonizing Terror. In October 1995 they released their first demo tape, ‘Disharmony in god's Creation’, featuring an intro and five tracks of a Death Metal with some Grind influences. Some concerts followed. The band’s line-up was always a bit unstable, but the core was always guitarist Tojó and the drummer Sara. They were featured in a number of cassette compilations (‘Beowolf Comp.’ (U.S.), ‘Mutant Prod. Comp.’ (Ita), ‘S.M.O. Comp.’ (Por), ‘Fénix Sampler I’ (Por) and ‘Metal Rec. Comp.’ (Por)), and even two Portuguese CD compilations in 1996 (‘Danger In Death's World’ and ‘High Radiation - Vol. II’).

In April 1997 they released the promo tape ‘Ways of Existence’. This was followed by a number of gigs. They recorded what would have been their first mini CD, ‘The Forthcoming Plague’, but it was never released because meanwhile Tojó was arrested for stabbing his parents to death in August 1999 in the day of the last solar eclipse of the century. According to Tojó, it was the drummer Sara who pushed him to do it. But, Sara has been proven innocent. Nuno, a friend of the band who was a member of Porto’s Black Metal band Summum Malum, was also interrogated by the police about the murder. With Tojó’s arrest, Agonizing Terror came to its end.
