Isthar is a Melodic Black Metal band from Sweden. Almost a decade ago Isthar was founded in order to originally create a unique symbiosis of Black, Death and Doom Metal. Although originally started as a duo, John (vocals) and Rainier (bass and programming), the permanent line-up as it is today was formed at the dawn of 1997. 

They are strongly influenced by the Nordic Black Metal scene but also by bands like Winter, Necromantia, Samael and Bolt Thrower, they set their own musical path irrespective of trends and dogmas. They sound like fast Black/Death Metal with string elements and strong elements bass drumming. Their songs often contain poetic dark interludes, in which they slow down the tempo and and whisper in a dark accent.

After two both national and international well received releases; the 1999 "Isthar" and the 2000 album entitled "The Weak Will Perish", Isthar strikes again with their third release. This time a full-length self released album. Recorded at "Excess Studios" in Rotterdam (where also the dutch band "Textures" recorded their drums for their new album "Drawing Circles") "Among the Ruins" is their darkest, most brutal and most expensive production yet. Not only the usage of two bass guitars but also orchestral instruments like timpani and a concert bass drum create a sound that distinguishes them from the masses.

Isthar, the Mesopotamian goddess of creation and destruction, symbolizes the dualism of life itself. Therefore it stands for the complete, both musical and lyrical, concept. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Isthar">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
