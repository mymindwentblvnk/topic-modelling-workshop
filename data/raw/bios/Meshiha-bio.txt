BIO
Dallas, TX 1998: Brian Wynn, Brad Fincher, and Wayne Knupp founded Devourment and recorded a demo called "Impaled." After recruiting Ruben Rosas, Kevin Clark, and Mike Majewski, Brian and Brad wrote and recorded the seminal album "Molesting The Decapitated" which established Devourment as the preeminent TX based brutal slam death metal band.

Dallas, TX 2012: Brian and Brad reunite with the intention of continuing where they left off with Devourment and "Molesting The Decapitated." Meshiha is their vision to take the sound they created on MTD, the most crushingly brutal slam death metal, combined with elements of grind, with an emphasis on powerfully cohesive, catchy song structures, and push it to the next level of world-ending brutality. They have assembled the perfect soldiers required to execute this vision in the forms of Joseph Riojas and Dave Spencer. Joseph's powerful, guttural vocals and Dave's deadly precise basswork enhance the power of this already formidable beast. Unmatched sub-sonic aural devastation shall commence. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Meshiha">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
