In 2005 singer Takis N. approached guitarist Kimon Zeliotis to help him record and produce a demo. At the time Kimon had just completed a 4 song demo with his one man project "Detached" (www.soundclick.com/detachedgr) which was chosen as demo of the month September 2005 in greek "Metal Hammer" magazine. Takis had a first song almost ready which Kimon helped to complete and then record and mix. Bassist Thomas Kouris from the band Fading Reality also helped with the bass guitar replacing the programmed one. This first song's name was "Breaking". Through this experience Takis and Kimon realized there was good chemistry between them and they decided they should form a band together. This band's name was "Escalation". The next song which was also based on Takis N.'s ideas and was originally intended to be in his demo was called "Transparent Walls". Kimon arranged the song and tried to add some of his ideas and personal sound and the ending result was the group's first metal ballad. With their next two songs "The Shine" and "Instrument Of Cure" the band showed a slightly different approach to their music writing with a little more complex and heavy arrangments and with some progressive metal elements added. In February 2009 Escalation completed recording a 10 minute epic song called "Last Sunrise". These 5 songs will be included in the bands first demo CD called "The Shine" Next in line for the band is to find musicians to form a complete band, since until now besides Kimon's guitars and Takis's vocals all instruments were programmed. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Escalation">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
