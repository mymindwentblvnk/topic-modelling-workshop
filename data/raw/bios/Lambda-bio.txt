1) LAMBDA was a trance-act from The Netherlands created by the producer/DJ Edwin Keur. In 1996 his track "Hold On Tight" was a massive clubhit and is deemed to be a club classic.

2) LAMBDA is also the project band of the German virtuosic double-bass player Carsten Hundt

3) Lambda or Î› is also a Czech stoner rock band.

LAMBDA creates a range of sounds out of his acoustic double-bass (contrabass) that are quite unusual for this instrument. Selected electronic effects produce wonderful, strange, mystic and sometimes bizarre soundscapes.
