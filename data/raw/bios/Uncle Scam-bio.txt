ARTIST BIO
Uncle Scam (was, or is) a Hard Core, Skate Rock, Punk band that gave the GVDP something to talk about in their coffee room on any given day or night between 1996 and 2003. Uncle Scam gave their neighbors a reason to leave their houses and play golf, and most importantly they provided good times for the punks, metal heads, and other weirdos searching for something more within the black hole that many refer to as Nevada County. The band got banned, or caused some sort of ruckus just about everywhere possible in Nevada County and were fined for more than the total value of all 4 of their vehicles for putting up WAY TOO many flyers, way too many times!!!!
