Dead Favours have been quick to grab the attention of the New Zealand music scene and are going from strength to strength in a very short time.

Since their formation in early 2016, the band have released a string of singles, the most notable to date being ‘Dig’ (produced by Shihad’s Tom Larkin), a riff-centric banger that quickly grabbed the attention of both audiences and radio programmers alike, spending an impressive 27 weeks in the charts. The success of the debut single lead to a nationwide tour alongside the already popular Skinny Hobos, Decades and Bakers Eddy which saw the band increase momentum and pick up an army of new fans all around the country.

The band quickly followed with the singles ‘High Flying’ and ‘Better The Weather’ (produced again by Tom Larkin) which has seen the band go on to be invited to perform at festivals such as Jim Beam Homegrown, Demon Energy Rock The Park and share the stage with international acts Royal Blood and Rise Against which was received with rave reviews.

Dead Favours have become regular favourites on both Radio Hauraki and The Rock FM are now looking towards releasing their next single they have just recorded before a string of shows supporting New Zealand Rock icon’s “The Feelers” in July, while finishing off their debut album due for release in early 2019. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dead+Favours">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
