The band was started in January 2006 by Thomas and Marieke, who created HeoNiA's first two compositions when there were just the two of them: Despair (a musical piece with constantly changing rhythms) and The Voice (more linear and strong). 

From February to July 2006, the band grew with the arrival of Damien, Cédric and Rudy; and one year later with Cléo on bass guitar. The musical universes of each new member of the band are really different and bring melodic, dark or complex touches to the latest compositions.

In November 2008, having tested their music on stage for one year, HeoNiA released their first EP Simulacra to encouraging reviews. In June 2009, Cléo quit the band and Christophe became the bass player in HeoNiA. His style and his technique are strongly influenced by Progressive Metal and enrich the musical structures of the songs.

That same month, HeoNiA headed for the studios to record their album Winsome Scar released in September 2010. 

In August 2011, Dereck became the nex drummer of Heonia.

The band is currently working on new original compositions. 

The influences of the members are varied and go from The Gathering, Nightwish, Within Temptation, to Opeth, My Dying Bride through Pain Of Salvation, Windir, Dream Theater, Stream Of Passion and many others... HeoNiA has a kind of unique dark and progressive music.
