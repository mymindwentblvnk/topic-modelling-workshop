Ken Stringfellow is most widely known as Jon Auer's partner in the Seattle-based "power pop" group, The Posies, but is also a well-respected artist and producer in his own right.

Ken's solo career began with the 1997 release, This Sounds Like Goodbye and the low-fi, experimental feel of this album was a departure from the richness of The Posies sound. 

His second solo release, Touched, had the misfortune of a September 11, 2001 street date and as a result, did not receive the attention it deserved. The outright experimentalism found in his solo debut was replaced by a more polished and rounded sound that is more reminiscent of his work in The Posies.

Stringfellow's third solo effort, Soft Commands, was released to critical acclaim in 2004. 

In addition to his solo work and The Posies, Stringfellow has produced albums for several artists around the world and has worked with REM and Big Star, both in the studio and on the road.

According to Stringfellow's blog at http://www.kenstringfellow.com, a new solo album is being recorded in 2007. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ken+Stringfellow">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
