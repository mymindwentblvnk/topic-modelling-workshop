From the band's Facebook bio:

From the depths of the underground comes Ancient Spell.... A Los Angeles based band comprised of local musicians Donnie Marhefka on Lead Vocals, Conrad Viz on Guitars/Vocals, Jeff Clark on Bass, Danny Blaze on Guitar and Rob Thompson on Drums. Influenced by many genres of music, they have one common style they have a true passion for, Heavy Metal. Inspired by classic, thrash, doom, and power metal, they each bring their talents to the table and create a Heavy wall of sound. The band's debut EP is now available on iTunes, CDbaby.com, and Amazon. 
Ancient Spell is planning to record their second CD to be released in the Summer of 2015.
