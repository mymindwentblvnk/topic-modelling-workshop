Creutzfeldt & Jakob is a German hip-hop crew, consisting of Phillip Dammann (Flipstar), Laki Polichronidis (Lakmann), Till Gr√∂nemeyer (Till Tomorrow) and Sebastian Edler(DJ Edler). 
The crew from Witten had their breakthrough in the underground-rap-scene in 1999, when they released the single "Partner Teil 1 + 2" on "Put da needle to da records" label.
In 2000 they released their debut album "Gottes Werk und Creutzfelds Beitrag". Especially the track "Fedehandschuh" with the MC "Kool Savas" made them famous. 
After that C&J left the "Put da needle to da records"-label, and were signed to Universal Music. At UM they released their second album "2 Mann Gegen Den Rest" in 2003 (single: "Heute Nacht"), which was strongly influenced by the American rap scene. The album wasn't very successful and C&J left the Universal Music label, and Flipstar founded (together with the German rapper "Slick One") the "Selfmade Records" label. Since then C&J didn't released any new tracks. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Creutzfeld+&+Jakob">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
