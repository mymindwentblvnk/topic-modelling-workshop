niemandsluft has been put to life by Nullius in autumn 2008 to combine three parts of artistical interests: The visual component, which includes Photography, for example. Second the audible chapter, which is currently the biggest part including the songs, mainly Ambient Black Metal, but always experimental and non conform to who- or whatever, not even current Black Metal "rules". The third part is the lyrical implementation, basically the lyrics of the songs, but also poems and written-down thoughts of human matters like belief, necessities, religion, existance and the conflicts that result out of them all. Together with session musicians like Gr'mbarth or other talented guests there's always big effort to create the own sound and direction to evolve.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/niemandsluft">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
