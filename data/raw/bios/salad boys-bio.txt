Hailing from Christchurch, New Zealand, Salad Boys are a jangly guitar pop trio whose sound harks back to their hometown's Flying Nun. Named after a misheard line in a Feelies song and having backed up David Kilgour of the Clean, the Boys' low-key jangle and strong melodic sense take influence from each of those bands. 

Salad Boys are precisely what you'd expect from the land of Flying Nunâ€”a cerebral, experimental pop group, a bit shambly, with understated vocals buried in the mix and the bright guitar work pushed to the front. Singer/guitarist Joe Sampson, bassist Ben Odering, and drummer Jim Nothing (aka James Sullivan), three friends who had been active in a number of other regional bands, found success with the formation of Salad Boys in 2012.
