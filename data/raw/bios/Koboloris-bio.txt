Koboloris is a two-man band, hailing from Yorkshire, England. Musically, they are influenced by the second wave of 90's Black Metal, bands such as Emperor, Satyricon and Limbonic Art, but with an appreciation of other genres, notably Death Metal and Symphonic Metal. They released their first self-titled demo EP in 2012 through UK small label 'Three Rooks Records'.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Koboloris">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
