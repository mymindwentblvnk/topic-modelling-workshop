Summer 2004: Ben, Patrick and Silas decided to start playing some instruments. Since two years, they were covering metal songs but the missing drums were a big problem.
 
In april 2006 they found a drummer in an announcement. This was the foundation of the Band "Abyss of Fear".
 
After 3 months of rehearsals with the new band member, the first gig was on a band contest in front of 500 people. At the elimination round, the band get excellent feedbacks. In the finals, they made the second position. After a couple of more concerts, the demo CD "Escape From Insanity" was recorded.
 
In summer 2008 there were some changes. Ben wanted to concentrate hisself on his instrument and Fabio, a band's friend, joined to be the new singer.
 
In 2009 the band wrote some new songs and recorded their first EP "Resurrection". With good feedbacks and new gigs, the band is now looking forward for more concerts and recording the first full length album soon. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Abyss+of+Fear">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
