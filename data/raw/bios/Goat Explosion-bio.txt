There is more than one artist named Goat Explosion:

1) They started off as Goat Explosion. For a couple weeks they called themselves Commoner, then changed their name to Elkland and signed a deal with major record label Columbia. After just one release on Sony, Elkland is dead and they are Goat Explosion again.

Except they don't exist anymore. Now the singer, Johnny Pierce fronts minimalist guitar pop band The Drums, and is pursuing a solo career.

It's not only the name that has changed in the last several years, but also the sound. The band released a 5 song CDR called Night Cranes as Goat Explosion. That recording was beautifully experimental, much like Radiohead's Kid A, while successive releases took on a 1980s synth-pop sound reminiscent of New order and Depeche Mode.

2) Goat Explosion is a Doom/Heavy Metal band from Leipzig. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Goat+Explosion">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
