Moroghor...
...was spat forth unto this universe from the outer nether regions of the unseen galaxy, to create a melange of psychedelic and xperimental black metal.

...cannot be expressed in or accompanied by words.

...did expound to challenge the constrictive conventions of the trve and kvlt fanatics.

...prove to the universe that light cannot exist without darkness, nor dark without light.

...is the original dark void from which everything else appeared.

...was the nothingness out of which the first objects of existence appeared.
