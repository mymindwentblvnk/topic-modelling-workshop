Thesyre was formed in 1995 by Eric Syre, drawing from his influences from Punk, Industrial, Thrash Metal, Black Metal and Doom Metal to form an outlet for his nihilistic and apocalyptic socio-political visions. He released several demos and demo tracks among friends and through the internet and gained some fame through his participation in tribute albums for Burzum and Darkthrone, before in 2002 he expanded Thesyre to a full line-up with himself on bass and vocals, K. on guitars and Zvord on drums, first releasing the infamous "August 2002" demo, then following up with the self-titled debut album. The rest, as they say, is history... <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Thesyre">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
