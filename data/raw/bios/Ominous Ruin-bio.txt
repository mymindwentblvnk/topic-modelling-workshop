We're a band based in San Francisco, CA; as of right now we're just three unknown musicians trying to make a mark on the ever progressing Death Metal scene. As with any band, we're trying to be successful while making friends and having a good time!

We started in the summer of '09 with Mike Ball on guitars and Will Catlett on bass. As two like minded musicians striving for the same sound, we started a project in the hopes of making a full fledged band. After jamming a little and writing material, Mike asked his friend Jay to play drums. Upon listening to some of the material, Jay took an interest and signed on. In early March of 2010 we started looking for a vocalist; after a few months we had our friend Adam Rosado try out, and we quickly welcomed him into the band as our vocalist.

We are as technical and fast as they come, and we are looking for other like minded musicians to join. We hope that you enjoy our music as much as we do, and we are thankful for any and all support!
