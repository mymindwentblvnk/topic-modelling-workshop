Mirrored Theory is the brainchild of Northampton-born Jake Key. Started in 2007, Mirrored Theory's style has developed from ambient roots to a more upbeat electronic style, whilst still maintaining the ambient feel of his earlier tracks. All tracks by Mirrored Theory are written, programmed, produced and performed by Jake.

Jake, 21, released his new album, Incandescent, for free download in the New Year of 2010. It contained many of the original tracks released on YouTube and MySpace as well as a new, never released song entitled 'I Dare You'. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mirrored+Theory">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
