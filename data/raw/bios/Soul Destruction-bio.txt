While many bands claim to have an 'original' sound, few can back it up as well as Soul Destruction. Delivering heavy, creative and experimental metal with a complete disregard for musical convention, they combine industrial style beats and samples with down-tuned guitar riffs; mix tribal drums with classical interludes and wrap the whole thing with schizophrenic vocals and an emotional atmosphere that brings the diverging elements together.

After originally forming as a studio project, the band soon realised their potential as a live outfit and after recruiting a suitable drummer, began honing their sound by performing alongside the likes of Paradise Lost, Skindred, Raging Speedhorn and more recently, Senser. At the same time they promoted themselves via large cd giveaways of their 'Descend the Trend' and 'A Lifetime of Dependency' demos before recording their first full album 'There's No Profit in Truth,' soon to be released via union black Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Soul+Destruction">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
