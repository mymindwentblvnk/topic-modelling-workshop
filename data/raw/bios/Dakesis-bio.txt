Dakesis are a five piece Progressive-Power Meta band from Birmingham, UK. Considered by some as one of the UK's fastest rising independent artists, they have come a long way since their formation in2008. 

Mixing European power metal influences with home-grown heavy metal, a heavy dose of tongue–in-cheek cheese and a fair dash of contemporary Prog to create a unique blend of modern melodic metal.

Emerging from a thriving music scene in the home of metal, the band have achieved much in their time together including high profile support slots with masters of the genre, festival appearances, UK tours and a highly acclaimed self-titled E.P, racking up a rapidly expanding and incredibly devoted fan-base along the way. 

Their latest release, the full length début album “Trial By Fire” marks the result of two year’s dedicated work. The album was self-funded and produced by the band with assistance from engineer Jack Traveller of Wyrmsblood Productions, and released on the bands own label CapsAArx records.
