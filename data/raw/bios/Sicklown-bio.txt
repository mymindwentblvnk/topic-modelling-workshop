Sicklown, currently known as Cave of Spleen, were born in January 2004 from an idea of Andrea Spampinato (Guitar) who founded the group together with Luca Milazzo (Bass), Daniele Calleri (Drums) and Enrico Strano (Vocals). In 2004 Sicklown record their first demo “Empty Bottles”. Fruit of a renewed style, the line-up undergoes various changes: Lucio Leonardi replaces Enrico at the voice and Toy Calamarà enters the band as second guitarist. The pieces are influenced by various genres, the eclecticism becomes the leit-motiv of a devastating symphony rich of claustrophobic atmospheres where the sense of restlessness reaches the exasperation. In 2005 Sicklown record "The Fury of the Dawn and the Quiet of Every Sunset." In September 2006 the Sicklown’s line-up changes again: Antonio Manola replaces Luca at the bass and Mario Di Marco replaces Daniele at the drums. In 2007 the recording of their third demo, "Echoes of Hollow", is over: it is characterized by a new sound which is quite different from the previous one. At the beginning of 2008 Antonio leaves the group, and the role of bassist is vacant until September, when Andrea Scifo joins the band. Because of a common dissent about the group name, by now inadequate, at the end of October 2008 it is changed in “CAVE OF SPLEEN”. Currently the group is busy in a constant effort in order to realize its first full-lenght. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sicklown">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
