Mayhem is not the only possible outcome of a collision. Another option could also be that something new is born. DEAD SOUL is a musical meeting where analog meets digital, logic meets chaos and machine meets man. The result? Dark electronic doom blues in symbiosis with industrial rage. Uncompromising and without excuses DEAD SOUL presents a dystopian view of the world, but always with a clenched fist and steady gaze.

"I won’t do as I’m told ’cause the truth will be unfold. I won’t be your slave, I won’t dig my grave."
