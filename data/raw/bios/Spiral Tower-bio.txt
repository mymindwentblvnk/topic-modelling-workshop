The band was formed in 1997. Their name comes from the Psychotic Waltz song off their first album (1990 - A Social Grace). The founding members come from Tragedy Divine, a progressive/power metal band which split up due to musical differences (other former members play in Sacred Steel, a more traditional power/heavy metal band).
Spiral Tower plays Germanic power/speed metal with progressive influences (which are normal as they are influenced by Psychotic Waltz, though they are far less progressive).
They have one album out entitled Mindkiller, which was released in 1999. 
The band's status in unknown, as vocalist Alexander Koch recently joined Winters Bane. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Spiral+Tower">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
