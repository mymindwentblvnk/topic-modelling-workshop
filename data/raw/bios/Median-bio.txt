Median (born James Livingston) is an underground rapper from Raleigh, North Carolina, who was a member of the Justus League. Unlike many other southern rappers who rhyme about being young, talented and stereotyped, Median raps about being young, talented and true.

In 2005, Median released his debut EP The Path to Relief, serving as a prelude to the album Median's Relief, which would later be released two years later. The long-awaited debut featured the chart-topping single "Rize"  (produced by Khrysis), "Love Again"  (produced by Koen) & "How Big Is Your World?"  (produced by 9th Wonder). 2011 saw the release of his second (and most recent) album The Sender, where he received some contributions from the likes of Phonte, 9th Wonder, Khrysis, Big Remo, Astronote and more. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Median">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
