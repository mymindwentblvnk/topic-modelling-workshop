Unsilence are a doom metal band, based in the North West of England. They have been active since December 1993.
The band have been through a number of line-up changes. Only the guitarist Kieron Tuohey remains in the band from the beginning. Although guitarist/vocalist James Kilmurray has now been a member since 2000(doing only guitar for his first five years and then taking up the vocals). There isn't a permanent drummer in the band. The drums have been handled by former drummer Jonathon Gibbs for recent gigs and recordings. And James Moffatt will fill in on bass in place of longtime bassist David Elliott. 
Releases have been sporadic largely due to line-up problems and also record label problems in the early days. They have only released one full-length album (2009's "Under A Torn Sky) along with two mini-CDs and a few demos and an unreleased album. We have recently recorded our next album, "A Fire On The Sea". It will be released sometime in 2014.
Live activity has seen the band gig in their native north of England but also a few gigs in London. And venturing out further to Ireland, Malta, The Netherlands (Dutch Doom Days) and Germany (Doom Shall Rise).
