Being a California kid and infusing a new sound into the south may be a seemingly difficult task. But to Young Lyxx it is all too natural. His early acquaintance with the music industry, numerous years of recording experience, a refreshingly pure talent, his love of music, and unbridled hard work makes Young Lyxx confident that he will be able to accomplish this mission. Lennix Nelson Rogers Jr. (Young Lyxx) was born on August 16, 1989 in San Diego, California. He grew up listening to the popular sounds of the late 80s/early 90s. His family moved to New Orleans when he was just 6 years old, but this move would prove to be instrumental in his development as a rapper. He was first introduced to the music known as “bounce” by placing his ear to the door of his older cousin, Yorri Berry’s, bedroom and listening to her rap original work in the late hours. Soon after, Lyxx began writing original work of his own. At age 11, Lyxx and his parents returned to San Diego, California. Music, always his first love, made room for a second love, basketball. During off-season, Lyxx worked diligently on his first recorded CD. He was hooked on being in the studio. By age 13, he was introduced to the stage for the first time, rounding off his experiences. The overwhelmingly positive feedback confirmed his suspicion that this is what he was born to do. He began to pursue music, vehemently. Recording on computer mics served as good practice for what was yet to come. At age 16, Lyxx linked up with other artists. Their first professionally mixed song was entitled, “Wait A Minute” where he was featured with Aaron “Ta’Ea$t” Evans and Cairo McGee. The three clicked and eventually brought Mark “Chicago” Beard into the operation. Lyxx worked on an album recording with friend, James “jBoy” Daniels(anup and coming producer from Oceanside, California).jBoyintroduced Lyxx to Pro-Tools. From there Lyxx picked up his own unique “recording habits.” Lyxx’ acceptance to Clark-Atlanta University forced a move to the Peachtree state. Juggling the demands of college, a thriving social life, and a rap career was made a little easier because of:
• the mentorship he received from rapper and former NFL player Reggie “Famouz” Stephens,
• his work ethic instilled by his loving parents Lennix Sr. and Kim,
• his sheer determination to succeed,
• the constant study of his craft Young Lyxx states, “being perfect is impossible, but I want to be as close as I can get.” Lyxx plans to introduce a new sound to the industry and with a successful mixtape (Top Heavy Music vol. 1: THE MIXTAPE), climaxing to 800k+ plays on Myspace, he is confident that his music is ready to be heard by the discerning ears of the world. “When I make my way into the game, I’m bringing my bags to settle in, because I’m not going nowhere.” His enthusiasm topped off with talent makes all those who have come into contact with him, BELIEVE that he is here to stay!  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Young+Lyxx">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
