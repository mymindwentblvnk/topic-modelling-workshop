In 2001 the band released "NVN" EP.The next year would reveal to be a turbulent turning point and Disassembled was…well, disassembled.Rejoined with Ricardo after 7 years, Samuel assumed a new musical path and gave birth to a new Ep, "2.0".Reduced to a duo, Ricardo jumps and Samuel began to work alone.
Disassembled finally released its seminal album “Portal to Decimation” in 2018.
