Nine Treasures are a folk metal band from Inner Mongolia, China. Four of all five members are ethnic Mongolian. All the lyrics are in Mongolian. The five musicians started playing together in Beijing in the end of 2010. What sets them apart is the spirit in their music. The songs are joyful and enthusiastic, at the same time rich in emotions. They have so far released two albums and one EP and played numerous concerts in China. They competed in Wacken Metal Battle 2013 and reached the second place. Since then, two more European tours are completed - October/November 2015 and July 2016. Festivals participated including Woodstock Poland and Metaldays Slovenia. The third album Wisdom Eyes has been released in early 2017. An European tour in summer 2017 is in the work. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nine+Treasures">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
