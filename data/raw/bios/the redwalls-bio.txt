The Redwalls are a rock band from Deerfield, Illinois. Highly influenced by The Beatles and Bob Dylan, their first two albums, Universal Blues and De Nova, reflect a hard-edged, youthful throwback to 1960s rock and roll.
Comprised of the brothers Logan and Justin Baren and longtime friend Andrew Langer, they grew up in the same Deerfield neighborhood.  The Redwalls brought on drummer Ben Greeno after their initial drummer, Jordan Kozer, decided to attend college at DePaul. They signed with Capitol Records in 2003 and released De Nova in June 2005. Their first single, "Thank You", was performed on Late Night with Conan O'Brien on June 21, 2005. They toured as support act for Oasis in summer of 2005, playing across europe alongside The Coral.
      After a 2008 tour of europe, 2nd guitarist, Andrew Langer announced he was leaving the band to pursue his own musical opportunities.

They are composed of Logan Baren on vocals and guitar, Justin Baren on vocals and bass,  and Rob Jensen on drums.

The Redwalls released their debut UK single "Memories" on January 5, 2009. Shortly after, drummer Rob Jensen announced his departure from the group to focus on other musical projects. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Redwalls">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
