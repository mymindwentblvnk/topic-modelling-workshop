Two years of intensive touring as Mickey Doyle took Michiel Libberech to such venues as LeffingeLeuren, Dranouter, Het Depot, Cactus Club, De Zwever and Democrazy.

As 'Artist in Residence' of Wilde Westen/De Kreun (Kortrijk) he felt the time was right to shift into higher gear with a full band, a new name and a maiden EP! Michiel pitched camp for an entire week at Pascal Deweze’s studio (Metal Molly, Sukilove, Broken Glass Heroes) to record the EP. Pascal was the ideal mentor and clearly stamped his signature as a producer and a musician. The result: five crystal clear tracks with rich arrangements, wonderful melodies and Michiel’s melancholic voice as the beating heart.

It is both striking and auspicious that Michiel has already developed such a mature and authentic sound at this early stage of his career. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mooneye">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
