They are self-proclaimed "specialists in the following styles: 'Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa', 'Upper West Side Soweto', 'Campus', and 'Oxford Comma Riddim.'"

The name "Vampire Weekend" comes from a movie that Ezra Koenig made in the summer of his freshman year at college.  You can watch the trailer on Youtube, here.
