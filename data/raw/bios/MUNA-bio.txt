1. MUNA (stylized all-caps).
Founded by Katie Gavin (lead vocals/production), Josette Maskin (lead guitar), and Naomi McPherson (rhythm guitar/synths/production), MUNA is a dark pop band based in Los Angeles, CA blending the brooding sensuality of R&B, rhythms of funk, and audacity of synthpop with raw, unbridled lyricism. They hope their songs lend themselves both to the euphoric dancefoor and emo bedroom solitude. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Muna">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
