Themes like the banality and loneliness of life have been consistently weighed heavy on 23-year-old London artist Matt Maltese's records. Following his 2018 debut album "Bad Contestant" and acclaimed 2019 album "Krystal", which endeared him to tastemaker outlets like NME, NPR, Line Of Best Fit, Vice, Interview, DIY, Dork and more, his appropriately titled EP "madhouse" isn't just a score for the everyday boredoms we encounter.

Maltese has always nailed lonesome provocations with idiosyncratic dry wit but "madhouse" reckons with those emotions in a way the half Brittish, half Canadian hasn't yet fully explored until now. "I've found that sometimes the majority of the emotional journey of love and life is actually the search for an understanding of it. And these songs try and make peace with all of that, poke fun at it and, ultimately, embrace it." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Matt+Maltese">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
