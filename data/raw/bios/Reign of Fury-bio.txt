Based in the West Midlands, Reign of Fury play a highly engaging and accessible mix of thrash and melodic metal which has built a huge fan base since the launch of their EP Psycho Intentions in 2011. With the release of their LP World Detonation in 2012, and an invite to play Bloodstock, the band have taken the live scene by storm. They hosted the UK charity tour HEADBANGERS BALLS in 2013 taking in 12 of the UK's best venues and inviting 50 of the UK's best emerging talents, along with US giants Hatebreed.

The band are currently experiencing a huge increase in fans in South America, and hope to tour internationally with the release of their second album, due out in early 2014.
