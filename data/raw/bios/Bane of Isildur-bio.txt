Hailing from the burning southern lands of Australia comes Bane of Isildur, furiously brandishing their own brand of Triumphant War Metal. Taking their name from the subject of so many glorious battles in J.R.R Tolkiens master piece, Bane of Isildur has moved from strength to strength with a sold out debut EP, a demo out in 2009 and full-length album due for release in 2010. Uniquely, Bane of Isildur's performance remains technical and melodic while remaining full of a fury rarely seen in today's age of heavy metal. During their short time as a band, Bane of Isildur have been riding a whirlwind of consistently successful live performances, including 3 international supports (Denial of God, Amon Amarth and Alestorm) and a handful of interstate tours. 2009 Saw Bane of Isildur gain endorsement from long standing Metal guitar constructors “Bc Rich®” and closed the year by performing at the very first Australian Metal Awards with the legendary Australians, Sadistik Exekution and alongside Amon Amarth for a second time on their leg across the southern land. 2010 will see the mighty Bane of Isildur prepare to hit the road upon the launch of their debut album ‘Black Wings’ with talk also of a live DVD for 2011.

Bane of Isildur are blazing a furious and triumphant path and are eager for the battles to come.
