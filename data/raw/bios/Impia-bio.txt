We have been striving to create something that evokes and emits the strongest feelings of negativity and resentment for everything living. Low tuned guitars,looming synth's and droning drums, distortion washes over you like waves of sludge in a sea of misanthropy. A new era of depression is upon us, an age of falling short and not living up to expectations, Impia, we feel embodies this hatred and deep seated anquish that we're forced to live everyday.
