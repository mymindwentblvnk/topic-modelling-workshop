Starting out sometime in the year 1994, Dash Own - emphasizing on positivism, unity and most importantly D.I.Y ethics- raged as one of the few striving hardcore bands that still exists in the local independent scene from before.

Originating from Port Klang and lead by five adventurous and open minded souls, Dash Own went through several phases of development and line-up changes. However, they still remained playing melodic new school hardcore with mixtures of old school hardcore, and also metal.

The band has come out with several releases over the past years and in the year 2006, they worked devotionally to complete their EP. Dash Own's expressions are not only limited to beats, rhythms and melody, but also through their feelings and passion towards life and the hardcore scene. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dashown">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
