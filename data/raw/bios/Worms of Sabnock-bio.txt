Quintus, Lesion and Moros first joined together musically in the late 1990s when they played in Nature’s Whore – a black metal band inspired by the exploding Norwegian black metal scene. Despite their enthusiasm they were frustrated by a lack of resources and playing abilities and decided to abandon the project.

In 2004 the three met up for the first time in many years. Satisfied with their own solo projects and dissatisfied with the lack of decent English black metal bands they decided the time was right for a new black metal project. United by a hatred of much of what they see around them, the band searched for a name that would indicate the vengeance that they themselves sought to inflict on their objects of derision. Demonology provided them with a metaphor for the summoning of destructive powers, notably Sabnock who inspired them with his malicious use of flesh eating worms that devoured his victims. The metaphor – that of consuming your victims from within – was prefect. The concept was united by the band's adaptation of corpse-paint to show wounds synonymous with urban brutality thanks to the inspired work of make up extraordinaire Amy Skinner. The Worms Of Sabnock were born.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Worms+of+Sabnock">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
