Semic Stains were formed on October 2001 by Stathis Theodorou (guitars/ex-Insight), George Zoulis (guitars/ex-Intentional Manslaughter), Vassilis Polychronopoulos (vocals) and Dinos Polychronopoulos (drums). In early 2002, Chris Bosmos (bass) joined the band, completing the line-up which remains the same until today. The band's style combines the speed of Thrash Metal and the melody of Swedish Death Metal, enhanced with progressive elements and a heavy American sound. 
    In May 2003 the band entered "Fragile Studios" and recorded its first promo-cd entitled "Sworn to Silence" with producer Vagelis Yalamas (Fragile Vastness). 
    The acceptance from the metal scene towards the band's work has so far been very encouraging receiving very good reviews from magazines and webzines around the world .The "Demo of the month" nomination in the Greek "Metal Hammer" (8/10), the Bulgarian "Progrok" (5/5) and the Brazilian "Whiplash" magazines as well as the reviews from other mags and zines: 
Metal Invader (8/10), War Inc (8/10), Bleeding Chaos (9/10), Metal Domination (8/10), Tombstone (7/10), Forever Underground (8.5/10), Headbanger (8/10), Behind The Veil, Quintessence (Netherlands), Golden Rules, Grande Rock. 
    In late September "Greece Attacks II" compilation was released by Sound & Vision productions, finding Semic Stains appearing with the song "Death of Innocence". 
    At the moment the band has already composed new songs and continues working on new material, which will appear in the band's forthcoming first full-length album. An Album that progresses the band's basic characteristics and shows a drift towards a more technical and aggressive direction.
