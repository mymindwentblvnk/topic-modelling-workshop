TMK or Thee Maldoror Kollective is one of the most original and intriguing post-black metal / industrial bands to emerge in years. Originated in Turin, Italy in the early 1990s, going through several changes (both in name and in members) before settling on Maldoror around 1998. As Maldoror, the band released two albums, Ars Magika and In Saturn Mystique, both strongly aligned with traditional Norwegian black metal but with several hints of the changes to come.
By 2001 the band had mutated into Thee Maldoror Kollective, with New Era Viral Order released a year later. Here is where the band really starts getting interesting, the album a 50/50 clash between their older black metal style and intense industrial influences. That, in turn, led to the full-on electronica industrial soundscape that is A Clockwork Highway, the band leaving their black metal behind almost completely. These last two albums, though notably different in style, are both outstanding - this is one of those bands working on their own terms, setting and then exceeding their own boundaries. Black / industrial fans should start with New Era Viral Order and then proceed to Highway, while those really into the esoteric side of extreme music (and are not adverse to heavy sampling, ambient passages, and exotic influences) might want to grab Highway immediately.

In 2009 the band evolved into Textbook of Modern Karate. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Thee+Maldoror+Kollective">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
