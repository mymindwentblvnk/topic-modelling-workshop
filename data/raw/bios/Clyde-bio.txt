Clyde, AKA Clive Astin is a Derby original. In his teens he was in several local bands, and it's noteworthy that as part of The Underdogs he supported UK chart toppers Dr & the Medics (The Underdogs were much better). Clive also played an integral role in the setting up of Mantis Recordings, and remixed Atjazz on the first ever release. He made further musical ripples with his remix of Mikeal Fitzpatrick's ‘Wish' on Yellow Productions, and appeared on Mantis again, this time with a shadowy and anxious mix of Kimbu Kimra's ‘Raise the Dead'. 

After spending years trying to convince Clyde to give the world more of his distinct style of music, Mantis finally persuaded him to write an album. The debut single 'Serve it Up' featured San Francisco based rapper Capitol A . who's flowing rhymes told a familiar tale of a night out at the club. It certainly struck a chord with many dancefloors, both musically and lyrically, spawning many tracks in a similar vein to hit the club soundsystems. 

The debut Clyde album ‘Hyper Reality' is now at long last completed, Capitol A. once more stepping to the mic on several tracks including the second single ‘Broken Slang'. Clive himself has also flexed his own vocal stylings on the album. His voice may be familiar to those who've recently heard Brooks' as Clive co-write and sung tracks on his second album Red Tape. He is also writing and singing with Rhythm Plate for forthcoming releases. 


Clyde is also one of the characters from American Doll Posse. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Clyde">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
