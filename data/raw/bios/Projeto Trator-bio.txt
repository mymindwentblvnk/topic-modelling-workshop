Two crazy guys from São Paulo, fans of “noise rock” met by the internet in the middle of 2006. They’ve chosen some songs and scheduled some rehearsals, only eletric guitar and drums. Influenced mainly by stoner rock bands, naturaly, own compositions start to show up at the rehearsals and what was an possible project, becomes a band.

With a dozen of own songs created from jams sessions, the Projeto Trator has chosen five songs for his EP, “A Bombástica Barafunda do Batizado”, a mix of stoner rock, doom, sludge, rock’n roll and every sort of craziness. The EP was released on the market and on the internet on march of 2007

Following it, the band appearred on the 3 on-line compilations “Brazilian Stoner Rock’n Roll”, with the songs “Raiva” (music video available at youtube/myspace), “Não me Provoque” and “Trilha Sonora para o Marciano Morto em Combate", all present on the first album, recoiling a lot on the web.

Having participated on importants festivals like "Grito Rock São Caetano do Sul", "Carnaval do Rock Solidário" (house of culture of Santo Amaro), and planning the festival “Stoner Night” (already with four editions), the Trator is following with its “Bombeirinho Tour”, in which is doing a lot of shows on the Grande São Paulo and in the interior, still promoting its first album, but with a lot of new songs composed and about to become a new cd, problably for 2008.
