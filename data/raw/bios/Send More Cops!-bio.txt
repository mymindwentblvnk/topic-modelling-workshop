"Send More Cops!" is a Melodic Thrash Metal band emerging from the "Bible Belt" of the Southern United states. Invisioning the world as a wasteland destroyed by power and greed, the fires burn out of control. War will change the face of our Mother Earth. Your existance will be tested... 

Formed in 2006, the band has evolved into something straight from the depths of Hell. "Send More Cops!" brings something from everywhere to create a unique Metal sound with thrashy vocals, soaring guitar riffs, heartstopping solos, and chest pounding madness.
True to the "old school" bringing back the days lost. THRASH TILL DEATH!
