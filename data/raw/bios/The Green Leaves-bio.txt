Experimental folky trance harmony psychedelia... This band from Winchester started out in early 2006 with a few bazouki based demos, and soon found a weird and wonderful folk based sound that they are proud to call their own. 

"A relaxed, almost lo-fi sound akin in my mind at least to the great Pavement, but Pavement if they had started breeding illicitly with The Levellers and playing with Southamptons lo-fi bubblegum indie-pop urchins Tri-City President"
Jerome Cross, The Winchester Massive.
