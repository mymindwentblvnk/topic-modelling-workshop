Maggot Twat is a comedic and experimental death metal band consisting of a guitarist, bassist, and a puppet drummer (Dick Pancakes). Their first album, Stuffed Animal Orgy, came out in 1998 and earned the band a nigh-famous reputation in the Chicago area for their filthy and disgusting yet hilarious lyrics. A video was made for Tard Alarm. In 2006, Maggot Twat released Stuffed Animal Orgy's follow-up, 8 Bit Apocalypse. From Maggot Twat fans, the album was received quite positively. Maggot Twat was also known for their live shows, which often featured clips of pornography and cartoons being played on a screen behind them. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Maggot+Twat">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
