HAEZER is an electro DJ that combines elements of punk, breakbeat, industrial music and glitch-ridden Electroclash.

HAEZER originates from Cape Town, South Africa and has been producing his signature trash/electro sound since late 2008. He began his live career at Cape Towns mega dance club, THE ASSEMBLY, opening for visiting internationals such as Steve Aoki, Gtronic, Djedjotronic and Le Castle Vania. Soon after, HAEZER teamed up with Cyberpunkers (ITALY) and Saint Pauli (GERMANY) to collaborate on his debut single Who The Fuck is HAEZER .feat CIRCE (WTFIH - released on Freakz me Out Records) and later on touring together with Cyberpunkers on their 2010 SA tour. The Toxic Avenger met up with HAEZER on his tour to South Africa, a meeting that later resulted in HAEZER being invited to remix The Toxic Avengers’ new single “N’importe Comment” featuring Orelsan, released on French Label, ROY Records.

HAEZER toured EUROPE in MAY 2010 to promote the launch of the single where he played a 7 city tour including a show with Midnight Juggernauts and Holy Fuck at Paradiso in Amsterdam.

In July 2010 HAEZER toured Australia with Gtronic (Dim Mak/Lectroluv) as part of the promotional “WE LOVE NOIZE” tour for Tuff Em Up! Records, also behind the legendary TRASHBAGS parties. HAEZER headlined alongside Gtronic across the country playing 6 major cities. He has subsequently returned twice more to Australia as the solo headliner. 
HAEZER released his second single “DOMINATOR feat. CIRCE” with ONION RECORDS. This release was once again accompanied by a second tour to Europe where he played FUSE CLUB in Brussels with Felix Cartal and Borgore, Stuttgart with Le Petit Polous, Venice, Madrid, Munich, Love Electro Festival and the LeRoboteria Halloween party in Rome with The Oddword. He was invited to play Portugal with Congorock and will be performing at his second European festival in Switzerland, MARCH 2011, co headlining with Smash HiFi (Leeroy Thornhill from the Prodigy).

To date HAEZER has played at every major South African festival such as Oppikoppi, Earthdance, Rocking the Daisies, RAMFEST and Synergy and can be seen on a regular basis at the Assembly’s massively popular Friday night electro dance parties known as “Discotheque”.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Haezer">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
