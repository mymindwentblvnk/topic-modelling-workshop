Depressed Mode is a metal band from Pori, Finland. Ossy Salonen formed the project himself in 2005 as a one man band but with time, Tomppa Turpeinen became guitarist in 2005, Natalie Koskinen(Shape of Despair) joined in 2006 and became vocalist(female/cleans) and later on in 2006 Jani "Jamppa" Lamminpää became the bands bassist, which gave them a full line-up. They began playing very atmospheric & melancholic doom/death metal which can be heard on their debut full-length "Ghosts of Devotion"(2007), though in 2009 they released their second and most recent full-length "..For Death.." which displayed their sound shifting more towards symphonic death metal. Although some doom/death was still slightly evident in their sound, it was very little when compared to the albums predecessor.
