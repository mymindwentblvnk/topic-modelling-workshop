Kouvola Thrash Metal.

There are great trios in music: Rush, ZZ Top, Venom and Motörhead. And then there's the splendid Butcher's Block from Finland, which relies on the holy trinity of drums-bass-guitar (and vocals!) when delivering their thrashy-deathy assault!  

Butcher's Block was formed in 2007 as a quartet. Somewhere along the way the band even expanded to a 5-piece and recorded two well recieved demos. The band toured furiously in Finland along with such acts as Total Devastation, Omnium Gatherum and Dead Shape Figure (yeah, we can drop some names in our bio!). Eventually, Casket Music got interested in the band, and as the end result you're reading this at their website.  

What is Butcher's Block all about? Well, thrash metal with a deathly hardcore twist! We'd like to think that Exodus, The Exploited and Sepultura had something to do with the way we sound today. The band consists of Mikko ”Lade” Lahtinen (guitar & voice), Kimmo Kero (bass) and Niko Kaartinen (drums). Originally the band had two additional guitar players, but you know how things are today with downsizing and everything else going on. We'd also like to use this opportunity to point out the fact that the core trio of the band has actually played together since 2001, but under different monikers.  

Our debut album, Stain of Thought, is out this summer (2010, that is). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Butcher%27s+Block">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
