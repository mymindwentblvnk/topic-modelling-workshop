The band came together in 1998, created by like-minded musicians Murat Bayhan and Goktan Kural who played together in the band Time Machine prior to HAZERFAN. The band got its final shape with the addition of San Francisco based singer/lyricist Beth Hada, bass player Terrilynn Bench and guitar player Alejandro Godoy. 

HAZERFAN creates a new sound - a fusion of heavy emotional rock and progressive arrangements with Turkish traditional and eastern oriental music by touching upon this region's diverse instrumentation, distinct rhythms and rich emotional tones. A sound that is difficult to describe, but one might hear hard rock, metal, alternative, progressive, world fusion and sometimes gothic undertones deeply embedded into the mix.
