Disentropy was a metal band from Degerfors, Sweden, active 2003-2006.
They released two self-produced demos, both in 2006. The first titled (in Swedish) "Om det inte märks så gör det inget" (roughly translated: "If you can't notice it, it doesn't matter"). The second one, a three track concept demo, was titled "Diary of Dust".
Some have compared their music with Metallica. The three members Anders, Henrik and Johan had no idea what to compare themselves with.
