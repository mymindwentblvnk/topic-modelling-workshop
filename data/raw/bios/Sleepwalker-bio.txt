There are different artists using the name 'Sleepwalker':

1) Atmospheric Black Metal/Post-Rock solo project of Michael Rekevics, the drummer of Fell Voices and Ruin Lust. The band has two CD-R demos, entitled simply Sleepwalker and Sleepwalker II in their most recent releases on vinyl by Vedavu Records. More information can be found in the albums' wikis (note that last.fm's tracklist for the first demo is for another band's album). Sleepwalker had begun working on new material as of May 15th, 2011, and was planning on releasing new material (and re-releasing its demoes) on CD through Khrysanthoney, but due to the closure of Khrysanthoney, it is unclear when this material will come out. Vedavu Records has re-released the demos on vinyl and has also released a live performance on cassette.
