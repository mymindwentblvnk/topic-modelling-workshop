Formed in 2015 when two guys Riku Lauri (Guitar) and Aleksi Heikkil√§ (Drums) had the urge to spread chaos and turmoil with aggressive thrash metal. Music is powered by our imaginations, nostalgia and our everyday lives living in cold and depressive Finland. 
Later the guys were joined by thrash brothers Severi (guitar & vocals) and Kasimir Kaakko (Bass). The band was complete.

The music of Tasteful Turmoil isn't for relaxation or chilling, Turmoil thrash is for thrashing, smashing and bashing your head through the wall every single time you turn it on!  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tasteful+Turmoil">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
