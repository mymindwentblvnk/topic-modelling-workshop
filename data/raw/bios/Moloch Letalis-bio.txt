Moloch Letalis was originally founded as Moloch in 2003 by Panzerfaust (guitar), Amok (vocals) and Diabolizer (drums). A few months later Kostuch (bass) joined in. Eventually the name changed to Moloch Letalis in 2005.

The band's first three years saw two demos (Suicide Spectrum, Cold Execution). The debut album entitled Apoteoza Śmierci was released in 2010.

In March 2011 the band parted with Amok and it was Panzerfaust who took over on lead vocals.

In March 2012 Moloch Letalis released 7'' EP called Czeluść.
