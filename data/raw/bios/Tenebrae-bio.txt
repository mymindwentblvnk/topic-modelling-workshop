1) A professional chamber choir, founded and directed by Nigel Short. 

Often performing by candlelight, the choir creates an atmosphere of spiritual and musical reflection, where medieval chant and renaissance works are interspersed with contemporary works. The carefully selected team of singers uses the acoustic and atmosphere of the building to enable the audience to experience the power and intimacy of the human voice at its best.

Singers are drawn from outstanding musical backgrounds – King’s College Cambridge, Westminster Abbey and Cathedral, St Paul’s Cathedral, The Royal Opera House Covent Garden and English National Opera – to create a unique vocal mix with an extraordinary range of vocal power and colour. It was born out of Nigel Short’s desire to bring together what he loved best in his own singing career - namely the passionate sounds of large Cathedral choirs and the precision of ensembles like The King’s Singers – to create a new kind of choral group.    http://www.tenebrae-choir.com/diary/
