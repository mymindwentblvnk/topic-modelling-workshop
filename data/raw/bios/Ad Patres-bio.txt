Death Metal band from France. Found in 2008, they released their first full-length "Scorn Aesthetics" in 2012.
In days Metal scene is invaded with styles and bands where many value appearance over musicianship, it would easy to forget that intensity and power are the roots upon which was built DEATH METAL.
AD PATRES deals with refreshing the memory of amnesiacs.
The will to perpetuate the spirit of original DEATH METAL led ALSVID, Seth drummer/founder, who officiated in various bands (ENTHRONED, <code>, Fornication…) to surround himself with cronies sharing this point of view.
The intent is nowhere near making a tribute band or simply accumulating OLD SCHOOL clichés, but to bring in fresh blood, stirring up a hornets' nest.
The first recording, released late 2010 and rereleased in 2012 as a Split-tape with american Deathsters Writhing, produced by GOROD's mastermind, allowed the band to quickly immerge, making big impression and that EP led AD PATRES to open at HELLFEST OPEN AIR 2011.
AD PATRES releases today their debut album "Scorn Aesthetics" through Kaotoxin Records and makes big impact, praised by both the press and the audience.
Unleashing torrents of hear catching riffs at high tempo sustained by floods of blast beats and double bass, AD PATRES provides its efficient and direct neck breaking brutality on your numb ears.
Dare you face it?
