Hidden in Eternity is french symphonic doommetal band. The band has been going for long time, but is still bit underground. Eventhough being underground, the homepage of band is like art. Band takes distance from normal massproduct metal with it's very personal touch. Violin together with un-usual stylish guitars, mixed with blast beats drums makes the sound of band very abnormal and intresting. 

In their first CD, On the Ninth day, the soundworld is pretty melancholic and dark, gruntlyrics are in french and clear singing is in english. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/hidden+in+eternity">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
