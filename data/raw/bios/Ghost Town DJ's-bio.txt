Ghost Town DJs essentially existed in the vacuous, anonymous realm their name seems to suggest until they stumbled upon a way to make the world take notice. Instead of churning out more of their bass-heavy, jiggling, Miami-inspired music, or reaching further back in time to glorify early hip-hop with "Planet Rock"-inspired retro-future gazing, they opted for a new formula: pair off throbbing bass with antique beats and R&B vocals. It worked, and "My Boo" (1996) became a single that was as catchy as the common cold. Their specialty, however, remains catering to those with big woofers and an insatiable appetite for bass.
