Vector was a new wave rock band formed in Sacramento, California in the early 1980s by Jimmy Abegg (aka Jimmy A), Steve Griffith, and Charlie Peacock. Peacock left the band after their first album. The band had several drummers over the years, including Aaron Smith and Bruce Spencer; both also played drums for The 77’s.

Although the lyrics of Vector’s music weren’t always overtly Christian, Vector’s albums were released on Christian labels.
