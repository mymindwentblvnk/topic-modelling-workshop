Acritud formed at the begin of 2005, their original members were: Octavio Dolores (guitar, keyboards, voices), Jacobo Pimentel (drums), Ramiro (guitar) and Moises Gasca (bass). But the band does not get very far, since Ramiro disappeared. Moses left the band & Jacob too. Acritud then turned a project of Octavio Dolores(Acrimonia(mex) - Dr. Morgue), Leisl Heath (uk) & Adem(Dr. Morgue - Acrimonia(mex)). Recording recently the old material never released in the past years. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Acritud">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
