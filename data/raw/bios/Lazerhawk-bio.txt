A founding member of Rosso Corsa, Lazerhawk is Garrett Hays from Austin, Texas, USA. 

His outrun electro is robot pop mixed with dark synths and the occasional lyric. Reminiscent of everything that was good in the 80s including Stallone, the Countach, VHS, Diet Pepsi, Miami Vice, Neoliberal Economics,  Back to the Future, Neon Lights and the Nintendo Entertainment System. Synthesizer  jams with gargantuan leads, hard toms, spaced-out melody and the pains of being pure at heart. His style is a fusion of fast driven 80s music with an electro twist. He has experimented with chillwave and disco, but with a fundamental link to the 80s. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lazerhawk">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
