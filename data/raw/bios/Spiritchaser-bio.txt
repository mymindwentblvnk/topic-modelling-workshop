Spiritchaser an UK's duo Mark Bamford & Richard Earnshaw first started producing electronic music together at the turn of the century. The music they create is a true representation of the mutual love & understanding for deep, progressive, emotive house & dance music. Spiritchaser have remixed for a number of Major Record Labels & Artists whilst consistently releasing top quality, influential records over the past ten years, often through their home grown independent label Guess Records. 2010 & their debut album 1440 has just been released in time for the cold dark winter months (if you live in the Northern hemisphere, otherwise it's perfect for those long hot summer evenings on the beach!) The album includes exclusive mixes of "Not Far" & "Time Will Tell" as well as new journeys in musical soundscapes & beats. First single off the album "These Tears" featuring vocalist Emily Haughton.
