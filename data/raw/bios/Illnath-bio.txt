Formerly known as Flagellation, Illnath is a Danish symphonic black metal band, formed in 1997 by Peter Falk and Jokum Thor Larsen. The current line-up is: Mona Beck (vocals), Kenneth Frandsen (bass), Peter Falk (guitars) and SÃ¸ren Jensen (session drummer)

Their music is heavily influenced by Cradle of Filth.

In spring 2002, they signed a contract with Japanese label World Chaos Production. Illnath has expressed that they do not wish to work with World Chaos Production.

"Once again we must conclude that WCP is a crap label and we will use this opportunity to strongly warn potential bands from signing with World Chaos - Do not work with this label!!"

They are currently signed with Roneklint Music as the only band.

Illnath has asked their fans for help in a legal battle against World Chaos Productions. It is still unknown what the reason for this legal battle is, however Illnath did ask their fans how and where they bought their Second Skin of Harlequin album.
