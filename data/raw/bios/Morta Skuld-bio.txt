Morta Skuld (formed in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1990) have been around in the American Death Metal scene for years, and every review of the Milwaukee Metalfest seemed to report them in a good light. Their first break under the line-up Dave Gregor (guitars/vocals), Jason Hellman (bass), Jason O'Connell (guitar) and Kent Truckenbrod (drums) was on the British ‘Peaceville’ for Dying Remains (1993), As Humanity Fades (1994) and For All Eternity (1995) but the label’s inability to get the exposure in their homeland forced them to switch to ‘Pavement’for Surface (1998).With new drummer Jason Mooney, the band announced a change in direction from their grinding mid-paced Death Metal in 2002 to an Industrial Nu-Metal, a style in line with Static-X or Skinlab, and a new name, MS2. More recently Hellman and Gregor have been seen in a new band called 9mm Solution, most likely signaling the end to Morta Skuld. In 2011 Morta Skuld announced they would be bringing back the Morta Skuld name with new material, and in 2012 began playing their first shows. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Morta+Skuld">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
