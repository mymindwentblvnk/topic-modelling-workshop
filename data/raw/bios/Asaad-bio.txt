“Both feet on the ground, touching the sky,” is the motto that the Philadelphia raised artist Asaad lives by. Asaad is best described as a peaceful warrior in the battle for individuality and fun. Asaad released his debut mixtape, Flowers, on November 10th, 2009.

Flowers is the soundtrack for reaching a dream that many perceived to be impossible. The upcoming release was inspired by life's trials and catalogues the growth that most inquiring minds experience because of them. The mixtape, cosponsored by Uristocrat.com, will see an online release, and will be available on various websites.

"Through an intense subjection of pollution and a boycott of self rises a rose in the asphalt where many have perished." - Flowers. 

He plans on dropping a new project entitled NO.19. The project will feature original production from Ritz Reynolds, WILL.I.AM/NoizeTrip, Bink!, Sunny Norway, Ray Bueno, and more.
