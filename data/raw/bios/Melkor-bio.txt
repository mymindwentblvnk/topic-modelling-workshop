There are apparently four bands called Melkor: 
1) Melkor is a one-man Black metal act from Germany(Mainz) by Patrick Baumann(Nocte Obducta).

2) Melkor is a Croatian black metal band. Its members are 
Erebh (guitar),Vitorog (vocals), Beleth (drums), Kudlak (bass)
It has produced a demo in 2003 called In the Ashes of War, and a CD in 2004 called Vjeƒçni spokoj(picture available as avatar of the group, to be corrected).

3) Melkor is also a one-man Black metal project from the eastern United States, only releasing two songs on a Rusty Axe Records compilation, although he recorded around a dozen more songs that he never released do to lacking interest in the music.  Later he created more Black metal under the name Moon Over Superior, which also disbanded as well.

4) Worship of all things dungeon and nature related. https://melkordungeon.bandcamp.com/ <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Melkor">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
