Decaying Purity is a Brutal Death Metal band that was established in 2005 in Istanbul. Mustafa Gürcalioglu (guitars) and Onur Gazioglu (drums) (who played together before in another band) founded the basis of this new group and started immediately to write songs and orderly studio works.

The band was influenced by USA death/grind sound and USA sounding European Brutal Death Metal. After previous changes of members, Malik Camlica (bass) was included in the band. The band wrote songs through summer 2006 while looking for a vocalist.

After different searches Serkan Niron was included in to the band and the ideal line-up was formed. The band then recorded three songs and published "Rehearsal Promo 2006" in limited quantities. The band received very good reactions from in and out of the country. Many underground distros and labels were interested in the recordings. The band was going to be in the split album with Fecal Corpse and Blast Perversion which was going to be published by Rigor Mortis Records (Texas) but because of label problems it was canceled. 

After the demo the band continued to work on songs for the debut album. In September of 2007, the band started recording "Phases Of Dimensional Torture" at the Istanbul/Kadiköy Turquosie Studio. The mixing and mastering of the recording was done by Serhat Deniz and it took about two months. For the artwork design the band worked with Jon Zig (Disgorge, Suffocation, Deeds Of Flesh, Severed Savior, Gorgasm and many more). Decaying Purity then decided to sign with Grotesque Productions from Spain. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Decaying+Purity">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
