Heliosaga fuses multiple sub-genres into a cohesive and focused sound. Rooted in a European style, Heliosaga combines elements of power, symphonic, and progressive metal to create an emotional and moving atmosphere culminating with powerful classical female vocals.

Heliosaga was founded in June 2010 by Damien Villarreal (keys/guitar) who was joined shortly after by Jordan Ames (drums). The first practices were held in a small storage unit, and the initial compositions showed influences from melodic power metal bands that had sparked their imaginations. A five-song demo was completed in 2011 with Jacob Horning (bass) and now-former members Christine Schas and Ken Lambdin.

While searching for a new vocalist, the remaining members focused on songwriting, and in June 2012 Chelsea Knaack (ex-DesDemon) joined as lead vocalist. Heliosaga then focused on a single, The Light of Ardor, which was released in January, 2013. The Light of Ardor was recorded at the legendary studio, The Terrarium, and features Adam Sagan (Circle II Circle, ex Into Eternity, Final Darkness, Echoterra) on drums. The song was mixed and mastered by world class producer Jens Bogren of Facscination Street Studios (James Labrie, Opeth, Symphony X).

The official video for The Light of Ardor was shot concurrently and is now in post-production. Heliosaga is eager to continue their journey by releasing their debut album in 2013. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Heliosaga">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
