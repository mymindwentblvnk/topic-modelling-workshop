The idea of pursuing a career as an artist came naturally for Atlanta's budding future star 7AM. After discovering he was a man of many talents, it was undeniable that 7AM would be considered a creative virtuoso in the music industry.

7AM released his debut album Sober (1-13-17) and is currently putting the finishing touches on his second album, titled NüSoul. It will be another honest, free and raw interpretation of his life's peaks and valleys, which have molded his music into something much more than the typical R&amp;B of today. NüSoul will take the listener on a musical journey, a journey where it will leave them anticipating more! It also promises a relatable ride with which listeners will absolutely identify.

"I love to write about the problems that I've had in relationships, especially since I've been in so many, " 7AM discloses. "I've been in love about three times and each experience has given me a lifetime of songs. I want each listener to experience life through my eyes."

"Without music I'd be nonexistent," 7AM says. "Every song [that I've written] derives from an event that happened in my life, or mindset that I've had throughout the years."

7AM is currently the lead artist on Digital Mass, Inc., an Atlanta based independent label. The label was created to present new talent to the world.
