Technical Brutal Death Metal formed in november 2008 by Julian (Ex-Cyanid) and Vaeis, the former guitarist. Jesper soon joined, and the three first tracks where written. Finally they recorded a demo cd in the beginning of 2009. Lasse Meldgaard (Ex-Cyanid) recorded vocals on the three tracks, and the Promo was done. After a couple of weeks with auditions, Ulrik took the place as the lead vocalist. Vaeis left the band, but within few months, Simon joined. 

The band has currently released their 5 track demo/EP called "The Brutal Discipline". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Castrensis">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
