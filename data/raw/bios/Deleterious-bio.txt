The long, but nonetheless exciting, history of Deleterious started in 1999 under the banner of INRI. As a two-man-and-drum-machine-formation, Bart Hereijgers (vocals, guitar) and Yorick van Steenis (bass, keyboards) recorded ‘Entangled in a Paradox’ in 2002. The EP brought more or less traditional black metal hinting the more experimental side of the metal spectrum. Meanwhile the gentlemen found out that a proper live representation demanded a keyboardist, who was found for a short period only. 

Eventually, in 2005, several events changed the band radically: Yorick transmuted into a guitarist and the band was stripped of the keyboards. Also a flesh made drum machine and an all-female bass player joined the ranks to set a drastic musical change. Results came slow, but in 2007 a new EP ‘Suspiciously close to Infinity’ saw the lights. The release received good critics and was promoted with a mere 15 shows in the Netherlands. However, due to increasingly unorthodox compositions and the annoying personalities of Bart and Yorick, half of the band ran off.

Replacements were called in and Richard Japenga (Terzij de Horde) hit the drums in order to deal with the odd time signatures. Bass players turned out to be scarce, but eventually the position was filled by Steven van Lint, astonishing friend and foe with his mind-boggling skills. Sebsequently Steven in his turn recruited Yorick as the bass-player for his other band Once Begotten.

With the renewed line-up longing to rock, a giant musical leap was taken exploring the boundaries between metal, jazz and the avant-garde. Bart picked up his clarinet to add a pinch of virtuoso and the result is ‘Highly Recommended’. By us at least…
