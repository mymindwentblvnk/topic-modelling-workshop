Fractalia is a concept that was born of the necessity of five young people to 
express its way to see, to feel and to live the music.

In June of the 2000, César, Iván and Joel, that already had played together 
in other projects, decided to create a group that satisfied all its musical 
necessities, so, they looked for a female voice that not only it sounds well, 
but also gives the feeling and life to the songs, and thus after hearing of 
several girls, finally arrived Maly, that thanks to announcements placed in 
the "tianguis del chopo" (A Mexican famous market of metal music) found 
the group. With her arrival the group took more power and shape. With the 
technique and punch of the musicians and the melodic voice of its vocalist 
it was gotten the atmosphere which everybody was looking for. Then they 
named the group FRACTALIA, which means " The Order of Chaos".

The musical concept of the group is a mixture of power of metal, the 
mystery of Gothic and the atmosphere of Doom. The songs of FRACTALIA 
are the interpretation of the feelings of each member.

In almost two years FRACTALIA have played in several places of Mexico, 
and also many underground places, having a good acceptance. They have 
shared the scene with bands of the level of Lvzbel and Crystal y Acero, 
(bands of a high fame here in Mexico)
Thus four souls, four ideologies, four musicians, are FRACTALIA!
