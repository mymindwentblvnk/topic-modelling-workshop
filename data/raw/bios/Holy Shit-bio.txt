Though lacking in any religious significance, Holy Shit have been divine inspiration for a number of other successful bands: Ariel Pink, Girls and John Maus have all collaborated at some point with founding member Matt Fishbeck. First record, Stranded at Two Habours, made together with Ariel Pink in 2006, is something of a lost classic. Its nostalgic muddied vocals and lofi sound effects are something that has come to define Ariel Pink’s later work, while Fishbeck’s crooning lullaby pop songs remains distinctly his own.
Since then Fishbeck has continued recording records, in the mean time keeping an evening job as a gondolier on Lake Merritt in Oakland. Perhaps inspired by the success of his friends, Fishbeck has recruited new band members and lined up a number of new releases earlier this year. Although many Holy Shit former band members have since gone on to wider acclaim, Fishbeck seemed destined to linger as cult concern with a devoted internet following. Now that he has returned to touring and working on a record as a band, Fishbeck may hopefully soon be less in the shadow of his previous band members. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Holy+Shit">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
