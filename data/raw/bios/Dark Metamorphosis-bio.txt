Dark Metamorphosis is a solo musical project. It was created solely for personal enjoyment, and is not intended to be played in a live setting. This music is intended to be used as an enhancement to your own imagination, and I would advise listening alone, preferably in the dark, or before going to bed.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dark+Metamorphosis">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
