Saatanan Marionetit is an experimental Dark Vortex Metal band from Finland, and it consists of Jui Satan (Bass), Nirz Satan (Keyboards), Raato Satan (Guitars), Sur Satan (Drums) and  Tritonus Satan (Vocals) . The only known word to describe the music of Saatanan Marionetit on the whole is "Chaos Metal", as every song seems to be of a totally different subgenre of metal than the previous one, with a slightly notable distinctive style the band has adopted as their own.

As of late 2018 the band is finalizing a new EP and looking forward to do some gigs and start working on new material. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Saatanan+Marionetit">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
