One Sudden Death is the comedy group, which formed in 1986 and began releasing music in 1991.  They are one of the premiere musical comedy acts on the scene today.  They're fronted by comedian Tom Rockwell of New Jersey. Sudden Death has become one of the most popular artists on the nationally syndicated Dr. Demento Show.  Their song "Inner Voice" was the most requested song of 2005.  They are one of the founding members of The Funny Music Project(The FuMP). In 2007, they made  Dr. Demento show history by landing 3 of the top 4 songs of the year, while doing guest vocals for the number 5 song.   Their official website is at www.suddendeath.org

In October of 2008, Tom Rockwell announced that as he was the only active member of the band, he was changing its name to his stage name, Devo Spice, to avoid confusion as the name didn't really say funny rap and was shared by too many other bands.

Another Sudden Death is also a hard rock/heavy psych band from 1971 with one album under their belt called "Suddenly..."
It is hysterical heavyrock madness from a strange combo that is reported to have come from Long Island,New York. "Suddenly" is a powerhouse album, with Banshee-like vocals, killer guitar work and an awesome backing section. The tracklist varies from slow doomy atmospheric stuff like My Time Is Over and Road Back Home to powertunes like Leather Woman and Crazy Lady to the mellow melancholic Come Away With Me. The background of Sudden Death remains unknown, but "Suddenly" is a strong heavy acid rock album that gives a excellent documentation how powerful this band was.
