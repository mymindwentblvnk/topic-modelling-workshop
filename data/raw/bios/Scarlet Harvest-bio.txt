Scarlet Harvest was a single-handed black/doom metal band founded by Mortuum Deum in Thurrock, Essex, UK on February 2014, working on writing and recording music that blends influences and styles in order to fabricate a dark musical atmosphere whether it's hateful or dismal. 

Mortuum Deum released his last EP during the band's initial run titled 'Perdition's Embrace' through Hibernacula Records at the end of the year, and Scarlet Harvest was then closed off on March 2015. However, a surprise EP had been briefly released on Halloween 2018 titled 'Parentum Provocant Dissociationem', a complete departure from metal in favour of ambient, electronic, industrial and harsh noise styles.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Scarlet+Harvest">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
