Oxford Collapse was an indie rock band from Brooklyn, New York, United States which formed in 2002. The band consisted of Michael Pace (vocals, guitar), Adam Rizer (vocals, bass) and Dan Fetherston (drums). The band announced their split in June 2009

A sustained, freewheeling nod to the great ghosts of American independent rock (The Embarrassment, R.E.M., Volcano Suns, et al) â€“ economically reinforced by the trio of guitarist Michael Pace, bassist Adam Rizer and drummer Dan Fetherston.

Oxford Collapse first released a limited press self-titled EP for the HCR label in 2002 (Oxford Collapse (EP)).

Shortly after they signed to Kanine Records, a label based in New York City/Brooklyn, where they released their first full-length album Some Wilderness in April of 2004. This was followed by a remix of a track from the album titled "Melting The Ice Queen" (Melting The Ice Queen (Remix)) in July of that year.

In October 2004, the band released a 7" vinyl EP, entitled Songs For The Singers Of Panthers, on Discoloration Records before releasing their final effort from Kanine Records, A Good Ground.

The band then signed to indie label Sub Pop, where they released Remember The Night Parties in October of 2006. The album earned a 7.9 out of 10 from Pitchfork Media, who also rated "Please Visit Your National Parks" 96th in their year-end "Top 100 Tracks of 2006" feature.

The latest studio album BITS was released on August 5th, 2008. They have recently supported We Are Scientists on their UK tour. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Oxford+Collapse">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
