Ultra crisp productions, cool synth melodies & pitch perfect vocals

Since his last release on Tru Thoughts in 2006 Freddie Cruger, aka Red Astaire, has been busy travelling the world as a DJ and releasing music on his own label, Homegrown Records – one of these releases was the debut, and now extremely rare, Wildcookie 12”. The “Drugs EP” received support from Gilles Peterson on BBC Radio 1 and the lead track, “Heroine”, also features on the debut album ‘Cookie Dough’, due out on Tru Thoughts on 21st February. Wildcookie is not a one man band though; each one of Freddie’s ultra-crisp productions and sophisticated synthline melodies are backed with the pitch perfect, often freestyled, vocals of Anthony Mills.

Anthony Mills is no stranger to the world of music. In 12 short years he has toured extensively with Harry Belafonte’s All-Star Band, recorded with Krs-One, Amy Winehouse, Leela James, Maxi Priest, Snow, Sizzla, Dead Prez, Doc (Esthero), Sly Dunbar, Chinna Smith and Grace Bumbry. Mills has written over 1000 songs in this time and recorded well over 100 studio and live albums, providing lead vocals for two other duos – Super Viral Brothers (Pope/Universal) and XXLARGEMILLS.

The debut single, “Heroine”, will be out as a free download from wildcookie.bandcamp.com on 24th January, when we will also be streaming three other tracks from the album. You can hear the single here right now
