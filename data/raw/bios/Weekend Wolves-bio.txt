"Weekend Wolves is the monster in your closet, the dark shadowy corridor at 2am when you need the toilet and catching the last train home.
Weekend Wolves is just one man based in Hamburg, who patches together sinister sounds and beats to create a quilt of darkness. It's easy to imagine what his songs would look like if they had a visual equal - probably anything by Lynch, or Psycho with electronics. Essentially it's the sort of music that will give you nightmares and we're totally happy with that."

"Germany's Weekend Wolves are super new to us (and probably you too), but they've been hard at work making shadowy and glitched-out songs for some time now, composing videos for their songs by ripping up found footage from old public domain films and newsreels [...]. The band have been around for about a year now and we hope to see and hear more from them in the future because it seems like it could totally work, in a hypnosis-inducing way that is."
