The Chelsea Smiles were a hard rock band based out of Hollywood, California . Formed by Todd Youth (ex-Murphy's Law and D Generation, as well as having played for Danzig and Motorhead) in 2004, the band plays a dirty, punk rock influenced brand of sleaze.

Joined by Jonny Martin on bass and Karl Rosqvist on drums, the band went through a number of lead guitarists before landing on Skye Jayne, formerly of Bullets and Octane. 

The Chelsea Smiles released their debut EP, "The Nowhere Ride EP," in 2005 on Capitol Records. Their new full length album, Thirty Six Hours Later, was released on November 7th, 2006 on Acetate Records.

In 2009, the Chelsea Smiles chapter closed, reforming as The Royal Highness.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Chelsea+Smiles">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
