Moahni Moahna is a Swedish band that was created in the early 90's by guitarist Henrik Flyman (Evil Masquerade, Wuthering Heights, ZooL) and guitarist Tommy Rehn. They wrote and performed their own brand of hard rock that was described as "Fantasy Metal". The band started as a two piece formation with hired session musicians, but they soon added vocalist Martin Häggström as a steady member.

The band hasn't been heard from since 1997 when they gave their last live performance as support to Deep Purple in Sweden. No official statement has been made about ending Moahni Moahna. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Moahni+Moahna">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
