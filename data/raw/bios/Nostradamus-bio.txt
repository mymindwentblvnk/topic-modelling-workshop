There are multiple artists named Nostradamus:

1) Nostradamus is a German new age project, created by Rolf Soja (production, music) and Brad Rundel (concept, lyrics). Their album "A Storm of Dreams" was recorded at Roso Music Inc. Studios and released by Sony/BMG in 1998. Though the album is inspired by the visions of the 15th century prophet Nostradamus, there are very few actual references to his predictions. Instead, it is more about ideas of prophecy, with songs about dreams, the stars, time and the future.

2) Nostradamus was a death metal band from Hajnówka, Poland, founded in 1991.

3) Nostradamus - This Hungarian progressive rock band was originally formed as Solaris Fusion, but changing their name in 2008, they have worked on as Nostradamus. Members: Vali Barcsik (composer, keyboards, vocal), Péter Földesi (flute, alto flute, piccolo), László Gömör (drums), András Káptalan (guitars), Tamás Pócs (bass), Péter Nagy (guitars, bass) <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nostradamus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
