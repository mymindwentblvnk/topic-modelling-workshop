Belako is from Mungia (Vizcaya, Spain) and was born in May 2011. It is made up of Josu Billelabeitia (guitar, voice), Lore Billelabeitia (bass, keyboards, voice), Cris Lizarraga (voice, keyboards), and Lander Zalakain (drums, voice). After several concerts and two demo tapes, the quartet won an important radio competition, which enabled them to play at high-level festivals such as Bilbao BBK Live. In March 2013 they launched their first long-playing record, Eurie, which they took on tour for over fifty concerts. In June 2014 the band released two EPs and presented its own record company, Belako Rekords. They went on a new summer tour and won important prizes from the magazine Rolling Stone and at the Premios MIN [Independent Music Prizes]. In 2016 they release Hamen, an album that took them abroad to more than 100 concerts, playing in countries such as Portugal, England, Scotland, Mexico, and Germany. They received further important prizes such as the Ojo Cr√≠tico from RNE [Spanish National Radio Service] or the prize for the Best Live Show at the Premios MIN. In 2017 they launched Render Me Numb, Trivial Violence and set off on a world tour through countries such as Russia, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, United States, Germany, England, and Scotland. In 2018 they added more dates to the tour and again played in major cities abroad, such as at the festival Vive Latino in Mexico, SXSW in Austin (Texas), and the Community Festival in London. In addition, at the 2018 Premios MIN awards ceremony they received prizes in the categories Best Artist, Best Live Show, and Best Video Clip. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Belako">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
