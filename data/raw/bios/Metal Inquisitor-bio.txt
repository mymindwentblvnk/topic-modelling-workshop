Metal Inquisitor originated in the beginning of 1998, as Blumi and Witchhammer decided, to call a real Heavy Metal-Band into life. A short time later they found KronoS (Bass) and El Rojo at the vocal cords, as suitable comrade-in-arms. Middle of 1998 they retreated for a few weekends into their rehearsal room, in order to record three songs on four tracks, which was brought out in form of a demo tape.
In 1999 they went to the nostalgic eight-track-studio "Overhead Project" of Joerg "Walli" Walldorf in Koblenz (Germany), in order to record two songs for a single, which in March 2000 under the title "Seven Inches for the Second Attack" has appeared.
With the new member T.P., at the second guitar, they have already prepared for a powerful live-sound. At the beginning of March 2000 Witchhammer left the band due to time problems and they found the right successor in Havoc at the drums.
In August 2000 a new Demo-Tape was recorded with the same old Four-Track-Equipment as the first Demo was made. After the good resonance's about all Releases Metal Inquisitor took the chance to get a record deal with Iron Glory-Label and released in June 2002 their first full-length Album called "The Apparition". The Reviews of the Album were from "good" to "great", so as the resonance's about the concerts from the following "The Apparition-Tour 2002/2003" through Germany and the adjoining countries too.
After their last concert in August 2003 they went back into the rehearsalroom to begin the songwriting for the next album.
The Concerts and Festivals in 2004 were absolute fantastic also. They've played among others at the "legendary" Festivals from Rock Hard and Keep It True. After finding a new Label, Hellion Records, Metal Inquisitor released their latest album "Doomsday for the Heretic" in november 2005. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Metal+Inquisitor">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
