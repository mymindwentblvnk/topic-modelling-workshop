Originally founded in 1995 by Chuck Labossiere as a side solo project apart from his then-current band Immortal Possession.

Chuck's idea was to create something that was new, experimental, and still rooted in extreme music, and enlisted Chris "Gillishammer" Gillis as a second vocalist and later on Prometheus as a third vocalist. The duo / trio performed live with this line-up with backing music being played over the speakers via a Digital Audio Tape (aka a DAT).

By 1998, Prometheus was no longer a part of the band, and Chuck and Chris recorded "Sold For Four Souls and a Seed." In 2000, Chuck joined Serrated Scalpel on vocals and Psychotic Gardening was shelved, though Chuck was still recording songs on the side.

Serrated Scalpel broke up in 2005 and after ten years of dabbling with Psychotic Gardening material, Chuck reformed the band with his original bandmate Chris Gillis with the intent of creating a live band - also recruited was Aaron Krause, the bassist from Serrated Scalpel/Lykeum; Andrew Wiens, who was freshly out of Children of Tragedy (and who Chuck knew from back in his days of Immortal Possession); Will "Willishammer" Janssen, the keyboardist from Lykeum who was bandmates with Aaron. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Psychotic+Gardening">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
