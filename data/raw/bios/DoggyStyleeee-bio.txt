Doggystyleeee is an emerging lyricist from the west coast who just shared a lengthy music video that will emit an extremely strong OG west coast rap feel that all hip-hop fans should treasure. Titled “We Different”, Doggystyleeee details just how different his clique is in San Bernardino and how they’ve always been solid to their values which is evident in the music video. Doggystyleeee flows with swift bars in such a stark bravado over the @ac3beats instrumental for the duration of the track and there is no question that his cadence will teleport you back to the days when N.W.A was popping. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/DoggyStyleeee">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
