Nokturnal Mortum is a black/folk metal band from Kharkiv, Ukraine formed in 1994.

Biography:
They started as a death metal band named Suppuration in 1992, then turned to black metal and changed their name to Crystaline Darkness, but had to change the name back in 1993/94 to Nocturnal Mortum due to a band already existing with that name. The band then changed a letter to distinguish themselves yet again to avoid another double name.
Nokturnal Mortum gained their first Western recognition with the release of their album Goat Horns, their second full length album, notable for having two keyboardists play on the album, often on the same song, and for mixing traditional Ukrainian music with black metal. As traditional instrumentation gained in significance and the lyrical concept moved away from black metal’s patterns, the newer releases are classified as pagan metal and folk metal.

They were associated with the National Socialist black metal movement starting around 1999, but later began distancing themselves from it, and in 2014 band leader Knjaz Varggoth (real name Євген Гапон, Yevhen Gapon) posted on Facebook that he was no longer ideologically aligned with the movement or interested in promoting a political agenda with his music.
