DREAMGRAVE is a dark progressive band from Szeged, Hungary that initially formed in 2007, and after numerous line-up changes, finally came to fruition in September of 2012. The band first released a demo in 2009, but with their new line-up, they released their first full length album entitled ''Presentiment'' in October, 2014. Their sound marries traditional progressive metal with symphonic, gothic and strong influences from extreme metal. Featuring female soprano vocals alongside both clean male singing and death metal growls, the music bears influences from acts ranging from OPETH and PARADISE LOST to HAKEN. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dreamgrave">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
