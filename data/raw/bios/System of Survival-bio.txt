System of Survival are one of the longest collaboration and pivotal figure to emerge in the italian underground club scene.
With a dj career that spans almost over two decades and has seen them build up a huge reputation through their performances in top clubs, they are one of the first acts to gain a continuing residency at CircoLoco, the now legendary Monday night party which is held at the world famous DC10 club in Ibiza.
Over the years, System of Survival have remained committed to their purist notions of what good dance music should be, continuing to create a wall of sound which ignites venues and clubbers around Europe.
System of Survivalâ€™s sets are a perfect blend of past and present sounds. They themselves have contributed to and expanded these sounds with their skilful productions and collaboration trough their releases on some of the most exciting European labels (including Lasegun, FreakN'Chic, Tenax, Vinylclub and Timewarp) and receiving major play/support from the likes of Locodice, Luciano, Petre Inspirescu, Rhadoo , Tania Vulcano, Josh Wink, Timo Mass, Dan Ghenacia, Tobi Neumann, M.A.N.D.Y. etc.
In 2008 teaming up with dj/producer stalwarts Amor T and Tage Sabo they have founded the project IANVS71 a creative playground of a label whose aim is to promote new ideas in dance music.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/System+of+Survival">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
