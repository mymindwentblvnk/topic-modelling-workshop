Ben Goldberg, known by his stage name Token, grew up north of Boston, MA. At a young age Ben was introduced to hip-hop and by the age of 6, began writing down his thoughts and emotions from events in his life and expressing himself through poetry. At the age of 10, Ben began putting melody to these lyrics and recording these poems as raps. What had started out as an outlet of expression soon became his passion. Rather than hanging out with friends as most kids his age were doing, Ben stayed at home continuously perfecting his craft and developing his artistry under his now known stage name "Token".

Token began cultivating his fanbase at age 14 after releasing simple videos online of him rapping. By age 16, Token had won multiple online rap contests and has amassed over a million views on his YouTube page. Along with his growing social following online, he began performing all around New England, establishing his live show amongst some known artists. Two of his videos, one of which was made when he was only 14, went viral on Facebook accumulating a total of 6 million views. Fresh off his 17th birthday, Token released a new video that went viral on YouTube and hit a milestone of 500k views in only 3 days and has since passed one million. Having garnered quite a dedicated following, Token has received many celebrity co signs including the likes of T-Pain, Fred Durst (of Limp Bizkit), Platinum Producer Clinton Sparks, RA The Rugged Man and Hollywood star and Boston's own Mark Wahlberg who recently pronounced Token his "new favorite rapper"
