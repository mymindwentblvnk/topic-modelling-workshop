Download Color Theory, their debut EP FOR FREE at their Bandcamp or from their mediafire, which Recursion has made available.

Hailing from Portland, Oregon, newcomers Recursion are blazing their path to the stage with a hot

fuses metalcore, djent, mathcore, deathcore, and even jazz into a fresh, raw sound.

Lineup:

Maxwell Montgomery - Vocals
Nick Durheim - Guitar
Alec Yoshizumi - Drums
Cody Schaffer - Bass

Neil Engle - Producer/ Engineer
