Death Rotten Decay started in 2002. It all started with Adam Dow and Jose Rios writing bullshit songs at the beginning, then eventually turning it into a band.  DRD then grew by getting Jeanette, Jose's cousin as vocalist, then eventually Rey.  The 4 were signed to Terrorthrone Records. 

Bull**** happened and soon later Adam left, then Rey, then Jose.  There's still talks that Jose will re record the old DRD tracks in the newest form.  That remains to be seen. Maybe in the future. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Death+Rotten+Decay">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
