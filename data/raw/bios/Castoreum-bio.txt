In the year 2004 Felix and Hagen founded the band Blocked Up Bowels. Caused by the different musical conceptions of the bandmembers, Blocked Up Bowels dissolved after their first gig.

Felix and Hagen used the next time to arrange about the style of music they wanted to play. After that Castoreum was finally founded.

In may of 2006 Torsten was added at the drums and Mirko became castoreum's new and first vocalist. They also had the fortune of getting a room for rehearsals at the Peenebunker in Wolgast. Musical dissensions with Mirko forced the band to divide from him. So it was time to get a new singer and after a short seek Patrick took over this important role. After our first gigs, we recorded our first 4-track demonstation-CD on a 2 days weekend in july 2007 and after that Flori became our new lead-guitar player. we hope to play more live gigs to get more stage experiences!
