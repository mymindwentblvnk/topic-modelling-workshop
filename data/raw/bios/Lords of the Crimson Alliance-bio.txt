Lords of the Crimson Alliance was a Heavy Metal band hailing from New York, USA. They only released an eponymous album in 1986, which is considered by many a lost U.S. Metal gem.

The band had possible ties to American power metal Grudge. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lords+Of+The+Crimson+Alliance">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
