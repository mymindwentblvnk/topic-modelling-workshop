#7 Amok (Hungary/Serbia)
The Hungarian Amok is the brainchild of the Nevergreen keyboarder Miklós Matlári and guitarist Vladimir Rusic, formed in 2004. This band plays Gothic-Doom Metal.

Formed in 2004, Amok had first been referred to as a side-project of the Hungarian gothic-doom band Nevergreen guitar and keyboard players, but quite quickly it overgrew that title.
Due to the influences of the other three members, Amok's music is another kind of metal than Nevergreen, it sounds even progressive sometimes.

The bands only album "Szent vér" was released in May 2005 for the hungarian label "Hammer Records". It is entirely sung in Hungarian, and has not been released outside Hungary, where the band played most of it's shows. Therefore they're often mistaken to be a Hungarian band, although all the band members live and work in Serbia.

Due to the lack of interest in further cooperation on behalf of Hammer Records, the decreasing number of live shows, and finally some personal issues, the band had slowly stopped it's work, and by the end of 2007 it was practically inactive.
