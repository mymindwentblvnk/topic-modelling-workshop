Skyggeverden is strongly influenced of Norwegian oldschool black, trying to make its own level of this music, injecting with heathenish power of an old slavonic and bulgarian spirit, to crush and ravage the christian souls. Following the thin line between the shadows and the fires of Sheol, making the sound more harsh, severe and repulsive. 
Skyggeverden is NOT a liveband and can only be experienced on record.
