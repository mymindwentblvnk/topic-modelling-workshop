Graphite Symphony is a progressive metal outfit from Warren, PA. Formed by keyboardist Anthony Brown in 2000, who spent two years writing and recording, and, in September 2002, released "The Machine" and "Unbroken". These two CD's had a total of sixteen different musicians on them.

After taking some time off, the band returned to the studio, and, in June 2004, "The 9th Cycle" was finished.  In May 2006 the lineup was finally consolidated and Graphite Symphony took to the stage.
