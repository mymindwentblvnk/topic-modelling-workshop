The band was formed in 2006 in Brasov, Romania and got easily noticed through winning a couple of awards in local contests and events. After replacing some members, in 2007 the band was complete at last, in the formula below: Tudor Nanu (Tudy) - vocals, Florin Huluba (Flo) - rythm and solo guitar, Remus Curte (Niflheim) - rythm guitar, Daniel Sugar (Susu) - bass guitar, George Bratosin (Shitgrinder) - drums, Alexandra Belibou - keyboards, taking the new name of Symbios Too. Nowadays the band is working on their demo tape, making sure the fans won't be able to catch their breaths as they are setting up for a series of concerts as well, meant to promote their latest compositions. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Symbios+too">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
