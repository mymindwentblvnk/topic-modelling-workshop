Kult Of Taurus were created in 2007 by Sarpedon and Sythanagon and later with the addition of PlAtÎ©n as a bassist,the band received the blessing of creativity which spawned 3 releases/experimentations necessary to create a path.Constant evolution/ascension has become the ultimate goal,including the creation of musick as a part of our luciferian asceticism, thus created wholeheartedly,blessed and cursed at the same time. The band's upcoming Full-length, bearing the name "Divination Labyrinths" will be released later this year. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kult+Of+Taurus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
