Cygnet Of Darkness was a black metal band from Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. Nightstalker and Trohostpanzer formed the band in 1993 and soon found Desekrator, Skullkrusher and KK to complete the line-up. KK left the band soon, the remaining members recorded and released their debut demo Endkrieg in 1995 and the second demo Man-at-Arms in the next year 1997. Soon after the release of the second demo and line-up changes - the departure of Trohostpanzer -  they changed their name to Witchbane. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cygnet+Of+Darkness">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
