Tomas "Ace" Forsberg (1966-2004) was the frontman and creative force behind the influential swedish band Bathory, in which he went by his stage name Quorthon - a name he claims he picked out of a list of demons.

In 1993 Quorthon set Bathory aside and recorded and released two albums under the name "Quorthon". The first was Album released in 1994, and Purity of Essence followed in 1997. The albums were more Grunge/Rock oriented than Bathory's Black Metal/Viking Metal style. While working on these albums he found new inspiration to continue composing music for Bathory. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Quorthon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
