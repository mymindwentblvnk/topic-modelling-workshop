"Reign the absolute" is a synthesis of contemporary metal music, since it's origin, joining music creativity and ideology of three outstanding musicians: guitarist Artyom Sherbakov (Icon in me, ex-Bezumnie usiliya), vocalist Andrew Jakevich (ex-Rashamba, ex-Yak) and another guitarist Vladimir Krylov (Toke-cha, Right Hand, ex - 0.5). The band with no doubt shows great musical potential and introduces it's experience through wide variety of metal riffs, fusion chord harmonization and hi tech guitar elements, and solos. 

Our mission: 
"Our music is our eternity, with us - it's architects. We base our making on our inspiration, philosophy, images and love. Professing absolutely free approach in our process of writing music, we do not admit any stylistic limits while still staying in touch and widely using our "metal roots". "Reign the absolute" project gives us strong motivation to become a breath of fresh air and to bring "the light" on metal scene". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Reign+The+Absolute">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
