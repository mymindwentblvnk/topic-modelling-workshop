Annotations of an Autopsy is a deathcore band from the UK, influenced by bands such as Morbid Angel, Decapitated, Devourment, Deeds of Flesh, Crowbar and Pantera.
AOAA were formed in 2006 and have released two albums (2008's "Before the Throne of Infection" and 2010's "The Reign of Darkness"), as well as two EPs (2007's "Welcome to Sludge City" and 2011's "Dark Days"). On January 18th 2010, they released their 2nd full length album entitled "The Reign of Darkness" on Nuclear Blast records, which sees them taking a more traditional death metal approach to writing. However the band has reverted to a more deathcore style on their new EP, "Dark Days."
The band has received worldwide success off the back of the four releases and a huge fan base around the world. They have toured around the globe with the likes of Suffocation, Job for a Cowboy, Hate Eternal, Despised Icon, Suicide Silence, The Acacia Strain, Vital Remains, Dying Fetus, Cannibal Corpse and more.

They were described by Metal Hammer magazine as "the first UK death metal band to make a dent in the worldwide metal market since Carcass."

"The Reign of Darkness" was released on January 18th in the UK and January 22nd Worldwide in 2010. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Annotations+of+an+Autopsy">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
