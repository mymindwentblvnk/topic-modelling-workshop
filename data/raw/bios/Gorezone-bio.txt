Gorezone is a Brutal death band from Oldenburg, Germany.

GOREZONE is dedicated to Brutal Death Metal in all its different forms. The style is basically American: blasting beats, fluctuating deep, hatecore & guttural vocals, heavy & hardcore riffing plus an intense live performance! 

Gorezone was founded in the north-german city of Oldenburg in the mid-nineties. In September 2001 the band recorded their first full – length CD called “Erase the Scum”. Eight high-speed-grenades with guttural grunts, blastbeats an some hardcoreriffing. 
In late 2003 Gorezone recorded a very successful four - track promo - CD which gave them the opportunity to sign a deal with CF - Records. 

The "Grind 'em all Tour" in Spring 2004 was also a big positive step for the band. A new full – length called "Hate, Peace and Understanding" followed in October 2004. The album got many very positive reviews in whole Europe. During the next three years Gorezone played several festivals (like the Fuck the Commerce, Tunes of Death and the Soul Grinding) and about 50 shows to promote their brutal way of Metal. 

In July 2007 the band recorded a second promotional CD with four killer tracks, which gave the band the possibility to sign at XTREEM MUSIC. In late 2008 and early 2009, after seven months of intensive work, in three various studios and with two new men on the vocals the band can proudly announce that the new album “Brutalities Of Modern Domination” is finally recorded. This concept album offers a framework in which all the songs, lyrics and the layout match.
