Ripping, tight thrash metal from Slovenia, Yugoslavia. Their second demo recordings, I remember they appeared at some 3 way split tape with Polska Malca and another band from I believe Kr≈°ko region, also Start Today in Novi Sad released a 7'' by them just before the war. 7'' was all instrumental metal on progressive thrash side, unfortunately I didn't saved neither the tape nor 7''. There is some technical approach at here too, but it has all, power, speed, melody and aggression, if you like old school metal you just cannot go wrong with this, believe me. Metal was huge in former Yugoslavia and this is one great example for it. Thrashing masterpiece.
