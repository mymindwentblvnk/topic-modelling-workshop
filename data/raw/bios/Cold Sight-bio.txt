Cold Sight is a band from St. Petersburg, Russia that plays melodic metal with female lead vocals. The central subjects of the band's songs are escapism, human efforts to find harmony with yourself and the outside world, and the problems of modern society.

The band has released their debut album A/H1N1, recorded with the help of members of the band Fferyllt and professional choral musicians including Bryansk Academy Choir's Alexey Shevelyov. Mixing and mastering was done by Dmitry Eliseev (Fferyllt, Stormbreaker, ВеданЪ КолодЪ). Aspiring artist Ilona Veresk (Lila Luna, Сны разума) worked on the booklet design and cover.
