Maceration was an old school death metal band from Esbjerg, Denmark. Formed in 1990, the project of a few Invocator members released only one full-length album, entitled A Serenade of Agony, best known for featuring Dan Swanö on vocals and keyboards. However, Dan Swanö used his other scene name, Day Disyraah, on this.
