VIVIN are Ada Joachimsthaler, Franziska Kleinschmidt and Hele Maurer, autodidacts and multi-instrumentalists. They mix electronic and acoustic sounds, beats and drums, Rhodes and piano, synth bass and bass guitar. VIVIN pack social criticism and dystopias into intoxicating electropop songs. Chaos as counterpart to the Greek term cosmos as (world-)order or universe describes the state of complete disorder. On the one hand, VIVIN understand the world around them as chaotic, unpredictable and also unjust. On the other hand, they themselves see in chaos - also musically - the possibility of developing something new. KAOS takes both into account: it is a socially critical album that tries to fathom the creativity of its makers. The 12 songs were written and recorded in rotation, each band member regularly using the instrument of another to develop new, spontaneous ideas and give space for the unplanned, the unexpected. VIVIN create on KAOS a divergence of image and text: on the one hand they are good looking, produce catchy electro pop songs suitable for dancefloors, on the other hand they have a dark, thoughtful side that underlies their songs and also flashes through their sound from time to time. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vivin">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
