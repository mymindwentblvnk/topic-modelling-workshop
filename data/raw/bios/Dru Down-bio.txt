Dru Down (born Danyel Robinson) is a rapper from Oakland, California who helped pioneer the bay area rap sound in the early 1990's. His Song Ice Cream Man from the album Explicit Game was a minor underground hit but he earned airplay with Pimp of the Year (sometimes played with more radio-friendly lyrics under the name Mack of the Year) from the same album. He also had a minor mainstream hit with the title track of his next album, Can You Feel Me, and he performed with Spice 1, E-40, Shock G, and other Oakland rappers on one version of The Luniz' song I Got 5 On It. He also collaborated with his Bay Area friend 2Pac on "All About You". Dru Down also plays a part in the 1996 released movie Original Gangstas (aka Hot City) and in 2001 he released a movie of his own named Hip Hop & Porn Stars. Currently Dru is signed to rapper Yukmouth's Smoke-A-Lot Records and owns his own record label entitled Pimp-On Records. Towards the Summer of 2009 he will release his 4th solo effort, "Chronicles of a Pimp" on Pimp-On/Smoke-A-Lot Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dru+Down">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
