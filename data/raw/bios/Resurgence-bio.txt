In early 2012, originated from the old band that has not had a spirit that is often gathered in a studio in Bandung, ID named Bunga Music Studio, and has now become a band that has a very solid personnel that Nabil (Vocal), Hegi (Guitar), Liman (Guitar), Jack (Bass) and Yusuf (drums). We named our band by the name of "Resurgence" of significant revival, because our determination here will rise and raise the other in every respect. Our music is influenced by many things in everyday life, be it good or bad, we pour into our work rage. Have fun! Stay Metal!
