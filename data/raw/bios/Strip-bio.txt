Strip (s3p) has released it's first album in april 2005.
It's not just a band, it is a multimedia band/project, and that's how it brought attention from the media in Serbia.
They had many gigs, more notable are:  a couple in Beograd, on Exit Festival in Novi Sad, Nisomnia (music festivall at Niš), Big New Year Party in front of the Serbian Parlament in Belgrade, and many other shows on TV. (MTS, Balkanmedia TV...)
After quite successful shows and couple of animated videos, two of the crew members (Petar Jovovic, Getho) had an opportunity to work on effects for the movie "Carlston za Ognjenku", and the other two (Boris Topalovic, Milan Prokop) worked on the musical TV show, Hitometar which is playing on Balkanmedia.
After finishing the effects on "Carlston za Ognjenku" band decided to make a new album, which is entitled: "Psihomehaničar".
It has been released and first video single is Štiklom u čelo.
