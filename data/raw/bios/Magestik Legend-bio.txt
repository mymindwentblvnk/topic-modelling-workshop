MaGestiK LeGenD was born and raised in Detroit, Michigan. Early on his parents were very influential constantly exposing him to jazz and the soulful Motown era. At an early age he was introduced to Hip-Hop during the start of the golden era. His early hunger thrived by a starving Midwest scene prompted MaGestiK LeGenD to enter talent showcases and he started making a name for himself winning emcee battles and getting second place at the 2002 Scribble Jam. However battles were just an exercise and producing, writing songs and performing are where MaGestiK LeGenD’s bread & butter are at. In high school MaGestiK LeGenD became a member of the group 9-2-5 Colony, consisting of Nick Speed and Elzhi (of Slum Village). This crew gave him a chance to not only MC but to try his hand at production. Nick Speed eventually introduced MaGestiK to One.Be.Lo aka One Man Army from Binary Star and eventually became a part of Subterraneous Records and also a part of the label’s production team the Trackezoids. MaGestiK LeGenD has appeared on the Subterraneous Presents Waterworld Too album as well as One.Be.Lo’s Projects F.E.T.U.S. and S.O.N.O.G.R.A.M. where he not only rhymed but also showcased a glimpse of his production skills.

Now with a solid foundation in the Subterraneous camp, MaGestiK LeGenD has gradually changed to a more global focus. With plenty of performing experience from touring nationally, MaGestiK LeGenD has developed a very high energy live show, as evidenced on the 2004 release SUB TV Vol. 1 DVD. MaGestiK LeGenD is currently working a collaboration project w/ his fellow crew member One.Be.Lo. Together they are known as SECURITY. MaGestiK LeGenD is also hard at work on his highly anticipated debut. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Magestik+Legend">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
