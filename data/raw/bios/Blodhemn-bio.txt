Blodhemn saw the light of night in 2004, a one-man Black Metal band formed by Invisus as an outlet for his need to spread his music and lyrics. The first demo raised a lot of eyebrows in the underground scene in 2008, and the critically acclaimed EP “Brenn Alle Bruer” from 2010 made it clear that Invisus and Blodhemn were very serious about what they were doing. Blodhemn became an underground phenomenon, which soon earned a reputation as a stunning live band. As a result of this, the band was handpicked to play at the main stage of the industry festival, by:Larm, in 2011. The title track from “Brenn alle Bruer” was also played a lot on national rock radio.

Blodhemn's debut album "Holmengraa" will be released through Indie Recordings the 18th of May 2012. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Blodhemn">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
