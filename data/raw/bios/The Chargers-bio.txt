One rainy Vancouver night Marco(ex-Witches Hammer,Blasphemy) and Steve(ex-Witches Hammer) were out swilling beers at some sleazy downtown dive. The entertainment for the evening was some shitty rock and roll band that everyone had heard a million times before. After about 20 or so Beers and several shots of Jack, Steve said to Marco, "These guys don't know how to rock, I'll show them how to ROCK!" And with that he fell off the table and passed out. The next day, Marco showed up at Steve's house with a guitar, and an old friend. Tom the pusher(ex-Procreation). Tom had a big bag of weed and played a mean set of drumms. So with that, they began getting drunk and stoned and began jamming the wickedest rock and roll since the night before. Not long after, (about a week and a half) they stole some mics and an old 4-track tape recorder and laid down 10 tracks of the purest rock and roll madness ever witnessed. So get up, grab a cold one, and get ready to ROCK with The Chargers!!!!! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Chargers">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
