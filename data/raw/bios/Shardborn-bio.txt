Began in fall of 2008 by Matt Bond and Gabe Lanciano. Originally intended to have a general black metal sound, the group wrote the song "The Harvest" and received an encouraging response. 

Soon after, the group changed direction to a more experimental approach. Looking to combine Darkwave and New Age into the Black Metal sound, they released the demo "Threat of Dawn" in spring of 2009. 

Shardborn plans to begin writing and recording their first full length in late summer 2009. The upcoming album will incorporate heavy Electronic influence to the Black Metal sound.
