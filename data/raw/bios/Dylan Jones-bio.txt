There are three artists by the name of Dylan Jones

1. One is a student from long island https://soundcloud.com/adam4

2. The other is some random dude whose discography consists of 1 1 track release entitled 'Swn Uffern'. 

3. Dylan Jones is a Las Vegas based folk musician. His songs are melanges of heartfelt lyrics, intricate yet simple guitar, and sincere vocals. They make me spew all over my underthings. He is a visionary. fap. 
His debut album, Chocolate Cake Heartbreak, is a blend of sexy covers and true-to-the-gut original love songs. His second album, Too Much to Give, well, I don't know shit about that one. 
He's playing a new song right next to me right now. We're drinking white russians and he's wearing a gold lame' smoking jacket without looking like a douche. He's pretty alright.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dylan+Jones">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
