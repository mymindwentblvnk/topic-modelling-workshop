Captain Overboard--Radio Earth! formed in 2009 from musicans from various bands looking for another style of music to play on the side.  Scott Bullock has been writing and recording grunge/metal songs under his own name for close to 10 years.  Roncore and Cole Kent have both come from the deceased "Project: Fight The Sky" and "Midget Cum Mustache", along with Roncore's brother, Corey Harris (former Clementia guitarist).  Alexander Evans also was a part of "Clementia" with Corey, playing bass, and also has a synth side project, "Xandom".  The band incorporates various styles from a wide range of influences, while bringing something lacking in this local scene, dynamics and individuality. We aim to make everything we do have its own identity.  The debut album will be recorded in the summer of 2010. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Captain+Overboard--Radio+Earth%21">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
