Big Joanie are a black feminist punk band. They describe themselves as "like The Ronettes filtered through 80s DIY and 90s riot grrrl, with a sprinkling of dashikis." The current band members are Stephanie Phillips (guitar and vocals),  Chardine Taylor-Stone (drums and vocals), and Estella Adeyeri (bass and vocals). Estella replaced original bassist Keira in January 2017 after Keira moved to Glasgow.

Based in London, UK, Big Joanie formed in the summer of 2013 to play at First Timers (a gig where each band plays their set for the very first time) at the close of the year.

In 2014 Big Joanie self-released their EP Sistah Punk, and in 2016 released their single 'Crooked Room'. Following these releases they went on to tour the UK supporting acts such as Downtown Boys, Shopping, The Ex and Sad13.

After a chance meeting with Thurston Moore at one of their shows in June 2018, Big Joanie signed to his new record label The Daydream Library Series the following morning. Big Joanie's debut album 'Sistahs' is due for release by The Daydream Library Series in November 2018. 

The band recorded 'Sistahs' over several sessions from November 2017 to January 2018 at Hermitage Works Studios with producer Margo Broom (who has also worked with Fat White Family, Goat Girl and Meatraffle).

Big Joanie's first single from the album, 'Fall Asleep', was released in September 2018. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Big+Joanie">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
