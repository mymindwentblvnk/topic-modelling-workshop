Brick & Lace is an R&B/Dancehall duo which consists of sisters Nailah and Nyanda Thourborne. They are from Kingston, Jamaica. 

Nyanda is said to be more like the "Brick" (street, sexy, rough) of the group while Nailah is more like the "Lace" (girly, sweet, cute). Now the duo is the first act on Kon Live/180 Entertainment/Geffen imprint. Their debut album, Love Is Wicked was released in 2007. 

Brick & Lace were once a trio, with their older sister Tasha, who left in order to start a family and work behind the scenes.
