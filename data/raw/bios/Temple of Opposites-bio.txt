Black Metal band from Galway, Ireland.

Formed in early 2004, the intent of Temple of Opposites is "to create primitive Black Metal influenced by some of the genre's greatest exponents".
However, it is a deep focus on the band's religious and thematic interests that directly affects its sound, output and direction.
Historical heresy, grail cults, Occultism and primitive Devil-worship comprise these religious and thematic 'angles'.
Several recorded tracks and completed demos were continuously scrapped after re-forming with a new line-up in late 2005.
Solid line-up finally emerges in mid 2006.
Currently working on self-titled demo. Due for release late 2008 / early 2009. A completed track from this demo was uploaded to the band's Myspace page on 10/01/2009.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Temple+of+Opposites">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
