Introducing you to Sophie and the Giants, an almighty, fun-loving, four-piece band based in Sheffield. Driven out of a turbulent time at school and a desire for belonging, when Sophie finally found her like-minded ‘Giants’ (a metaphor for how tall they feel when they’re together) she never looked back. And when meeting with SATG, what was crystal clear was the sense of comradery and love that they hold for one and other. 

So what has come out of this band? Uplifting, self-assured and uncompromised music, where catchy instrumentals are layered with lyrics of substance. And they’re not afraid to show a more exposed side either, take ‘Runaway’, a tale of not always being able to cope with what life throws at us and how sometimes the best thing to do is, well, you guessed it, run away. This mixed with tunes like ‘Break the Silence’, which leaves its listener feeling empowered and ready to face whatever the day may bring. That’s right, Sophie and the Giants caters for all of your emotional needs.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sophie+and+the+Giants">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
