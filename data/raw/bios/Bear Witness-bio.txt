Melbourne hardcore band, Bear Witness, began as a creative collaboration between long time friends Christopher Dicker (ex-HVH) & Mitch Coon (ex-Trophyknife) and was put on the back burner while both members focused on their full-time bands.

In 2009, with the help of Engineer & Producer, Tim Bates (a.ka. Tim Attack. The Red Shore, 28 Days), the band self produced and self released a 6 track self titled demo, which they mad available for free online.

This demo is available for download here:

After a few shows here & there between tours, in October 2010 BW completed their first full-length record titled Iconoclast.
With the help of Boston hardcore's powerhouse, Jay Mass (Shipwreak, Defeater), the band track the full-length in a manic 5 days at Viva Hate Studios in North Melboure (The Broderick).

Again, the band made the record available for free online.

In 2011, Dicker left HVH for good and Trophyknife disbanded, which allowed both Dicker & Prune to focus on BW as a serious recording band.

There are talks of a 2nd full-length pending in 2012. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bear+Witness">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
