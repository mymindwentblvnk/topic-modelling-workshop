Killgod is a two piece metal band from Nowra NSW Australia. 
The band started in late 2006 as a joke. As They wrote more songs together it started to get more and more serious.
The band can do nothing but please their local, nationwide and global fans. We can all look forward to some brutal new material being released by the musical monstrosity that is Killgod. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Killgod">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
