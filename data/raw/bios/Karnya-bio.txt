Italian Rome-based rockband. Previously Zen but changed name to Karnya in August 2007

Band members are
Riccardo Nardocci: Vocals and guitar
Enrico Sandri: Bass
Dario Di Pasquale: Keyboards
Luca Urbinati: Drums

They produce well-designed heavy rock, resembling that of Queensryche (without Q's sad habit of overdoing it) or Dream Theater.
