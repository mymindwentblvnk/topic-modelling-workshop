Frizzy P & Mr. Cole is an association between a singer and rapper (Pauline Sampler) and a producer (James Cole Pablo). After several shows with Reality Check and the international collective of beatmakers Tour De Man√®ge, they release their first EP, called Ladi Dadi, result of two years of coworking.
This project sends us in a sweet but energetic atmosphere. A mix between soul, trip hop and electronic music. Some melodic and bewitching rap content, orchestrated on SP404 and MPC. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Frizzy+P+&+Mr+Cole">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
