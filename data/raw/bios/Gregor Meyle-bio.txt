Gregor Meyle is a German singer born in Backnang near Stuttgart (13.10.78). His claim to fame came through the late night show  "TV Total" that runs an annual somewhat alternate casting show. While most casting shows forced their casted artists to sing pre-defined songs, Stefan Raab, the host of TV Total (also a multi-talented musician,composer and comedian enfant terrible), designed his casting show to allow the artists to sing what they wanted and not to be restricted to make appearances on competition TV channels. Gregor Meyle sang his way into the final with his self composed and written songs. With his very personal and emotional songs Meyle quickly captured the hearts of the audience and the jury (especially journeyman guitarist and music producer Carl Carlton).  During the show it quickly became clear that Gregor Meyle was in a league of his own on musical terms. That Meyle did not win the final was almost trivial, Germany was awakened to this new talent, of whom much is to be expected.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gregor+Meyle">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
