Since the ten years of Resistance, Dark Flood has managed to maintain its own musical contribution. From the very beginning of the band in 1996, the music has been controversial due to aggression and beauty, but yet high above an average musical expression. Coming from Oulu, Finland, doesn't help the fact that Dark Flood has been compared to several other Finnish death metal phenomena. Maybe staying equal has demanded or even driven Dark Flood to the point in the musical playground where it stands right now.

Dark Flood's musical processing is divided into three sections. The main composer, Kalle, leads the process by making a scarlet thread or bringing an idea to the rehearsal place. Arranging is the next constructive thing done as a group.  Ville is mainly responsible for the production affairs and the organizing. The final plating of sadness and melancholy comes along with Pauli's depressive lyrics. Dark Flood is not about dictatorship – nor democracy.

The melodies present highly significant role on The Dead Lines by bringing even some indie-pop influences into the melodic death metal scene. The band refuses to categorize itself as only a death metal band because of the members´ interests in emotional music, such as Mew and Tori Amos for example. Yet it is not only about grieving - The Dead Lines also shows more heavier and darker side of the band than before. The album is not necessarily for those who seek the average musical brutality. The songs are images of a wretched side of life itself for every incurable realist.
