The central Illinois' melodic metal band saw it's
first step of success with the release of their 2006
EP "NOW COMES THE MYSTERY". After touring and
performing countless regional shows, the band's
effort was adequate enough to catch the attention
of SEPTEMBER RIOT RECORDS (Jefferson City, MO),
who soon added them to their roster with great
enthusiasm. The highly anticipated release of their
debut full length album "THE DEFINING MOMENTS"
showcases the exploration of Estrus' diverse writing style.
