In their own words, Nitroseed was first formed by current Earthride bassist Rob Hampshire and guitarists Shane Balloun and Tucker Orr. Later former Spirit Caravan drummer Gary Isom (current drummer for Pentagram) was enlisted to take over the skins. Loud, heavy instrumental riff-rock is their thing.  Phil Adler from Wooly Mammoth is now the current Nitroseed drummer.  Although their first album was instrumetal, their second album will have vocals (hopefully to be released summer 2010). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nitroseed">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
