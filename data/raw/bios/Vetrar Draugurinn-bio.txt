VETRAR DRAUGURINN, formed by guitarist/songwriter Eric Hazebroek (Pilgrimage, ex-Stream of Passion), exists since 2016 and has walked the narrow path of odd musical choices ever since. Conjuring their own sound by combining a wide variety of influences from the doom, gothic, and atmospheric metal. Unique and free from boundaries.

With an experienced and talented line-up, which besides Eric and Marjan is made up of Jim van de Kerkhof (drums // ex-All For Nothing, ex-Morning), Thomas Cochrane (guitar // Hologram Earth, Dystopia), and Arjan Heijden (bass // ex-Acrid, ex-Daeonia), VETRAR DRAUGURINN’s aim is to write honest and humble music, with a newly found and mature approach.

In the 5 years since their official start the band has released the album “Hinterlands” and debut EP “I” upon the world. Growing from release to release, the progression can be traced all the way to their newest work ("The Night Sky")  which will will see the light of day on October 1st, 2021. Positive reviews followed every release.

Since 2016 the band had the privilege to share the stage with the likes of Swallow the Sun (FIN), Wintersun (FIN), The Eternal (AUS), October Tide (SE), Ancient Bards (IT), Xandria (DE), AntiMatter (UK), and Mayan (NL).

“The Night Sky” will be the first release through their own label Dark Skies Coming. The music industry is not what it used to be, which made them choose to make this new album available through the streaming services and through the band’s official Bandcamp and other websites. A challenge the band dares to take. A continuation on the Narrow Path…
