There are more than one artist with this name:

the Blame was formed by Can Talaz and Berca B. Kantarcıoğlu in 2006. Soon after, Onur Altınay was included to the band. After some unsuccessful attempts of finding a guitarist, Onur’s former bandmate Bahadır Sarp was joined in. The band continued with single guitar some time, afterwards, Oğuz Arslan was found through internet advert and the lacking of the rhythm guitarist was filled by him. With this line-up the band performed in a number of concerts, mostly by covered songs. Then the Blame started composing their own songs. In that time, Can Talaz decided to leave the band and shortly after was replaced by Aykut Özen. It’s the first record of this line-up which is producted by Deniz Tuncer of Saints’N' Sinners.
