ORDAINED IS CURRENTLY ON HIATUS. ORDAINED is a true Heavy Metal band. Relocated to Sin City Las Vegas from their home state of Virginia, the band has one goal: To spread the gospel of Heavy Metal to as many people as possible, as loudly as possible. Formed in 1996 in the Bible Belt of the United States, ORDAINED quickly gained a congregation with their brand of Metal. Adding to the musical mayhem, the ORDAINED stage show was a form of entertainment deemed "offensive" by some, thereby causing them to be banned from performing in their home state for the better part of two years. Before relocating to Sin City in 2006, local press crowned ORDAINED Best Metal Band Of The Year two years in a row (2004 & 2005). Together for over a decade, the ORDAINED list of albums, videos and awards is destined to grow, thanks to our strong, loyal fan congregation. Available now is " SINspirational MuSICK - Greatest Cuts ", 13 songs spanning the SINtire ORDAINED catalog (up to this point) and SINcluding a previously unreleased track.
