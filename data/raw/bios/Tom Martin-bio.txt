Tom Martin's Debasement Tapes is full of glistening finger style guitar, both original compositions and celtic traditional tunes, as well as original both contemporary folk and original songs. At times deep and soulful, at times dervish-like as the notes fly. The original songs are touching and personal, and the covers of the traditional tunes bring new life and a new approach to these old standards. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tom+Martin">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
