Morbid Sacrifice were a Death Metal band from Bellefonte, Pennsylvania. 

Formed in 1995 by Devilkill (Guitar) and Chris Auman (Vocals/Bass). The band recorded their only release "Severed Death" in 2002, however split up shortly after it's release.

After the split, Devilkill went on to form a Punk Rock band called Anti-Hell Society. Chris Auman and Drummer Tom Klinesmith formed Progressive Death Metal band Nightsbane. Nightsbane is still active.

In 2006 Open Grave Records reissued "Severed Death", making it readily available for the first time ever. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Morbid+Sacrifice">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
