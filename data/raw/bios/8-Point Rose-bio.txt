8-Point Rose from Sweden was formed in autumn 2009 by a few members of the former band Evermoore that had been producing demo-records and playing live in different cities in Scandinavia, Czech Republic and Germany for seven years. The members of the band have an average age of 20 and all of them live up in the north of Sweden except for the singer Marcus Nygren that lives 2000 kilometres south of the bands "hometown" Kiruna. Marcus was found on the internet by the other members and after discovering that the musical similarities were so many and the personal chemistry was so good between all five of them that it would be perfect to start a hard-working band together despite the distance, they formed 8-Point Rose.

Their music can be described as melodic, heavy and catchy metal with strong melodies, and they are inspired by alot of other Scandinavian bands like In Flames, Nocturnal Rites, Tad Morose, The Rasmus, Evergrey, The Haunted, Soilwork and Morgana Lefay. The music has both a really heavy and almost "extreme metal" base fronted by the furious screams of guitarist Alexander Timander and a softer surface with strong melodies and beautiful vocalarrangements fronted by talented singer Marcus Nygren.

The first months, under the name of 8-Point Rose, they released a tribute-song to the pop-icon Michael Jackson that recently had passed away. The song was released for free download at the bands website and got alot of attention at different memorial-pages for Michael. The success of the song also gave them the opportunity to play at two metal-festivals in the north of Sweden with bands like Lamb of God, Behemoth and Hypocrisy during the first months of the bands career!
