There is more than one artist with this name: 

1. Blackfire is a Native American punk rock group from Flagstaff, Arizona, formed in 1989. Composed of three siblings: two brothers and a sister, their musical style is influenced by traditional Navajo Din√© music and alternative rock, with political messages about government oppression and human rights. 

Blackfire have toured nationally and internationally, with numerous U.S. tours (including the Warped Tour), as well as shows in Europe, Canada, Mexico and sub-Saharan Africa (for the "Festival in the Desert").

Joey Ramone recorded his last vocal session on Blackfire's full length album 'One Nation Under'. Blackfire was awarded Group of the Year for the 2005 Native American Music Awards.

Blackfire only plays all ages venues, and sometimes combines performances with their indigenous dance troupe, the Jones Benally Family. In 2012, members formed the band Sihasin.

2. Blackfire is a black/thrash metal band from Malaysia. They were probably the first extreme metal band in South East Asia. First known as Metal Ghost when they formed in 1982, they later changed their name to Blackfire in 1984.

They were also the first black metal band to write lyrics in Malay, though their songs had never been recorded until relatively recently. This was probably done in fear of upsetting religious authorities and attracting government attention. However, they were already known from their frequent performances in rock festivals and gigs around Malaysia in the 80's.

Their debut album, Lahir Dari Api, was released in 2006. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/BLACKFIRE">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
