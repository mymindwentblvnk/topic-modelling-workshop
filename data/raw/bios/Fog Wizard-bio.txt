Fog Wizard is a 5 piece Sludge Death Metal band from Boston, MA who make the kind of music they want to hear. Fed up with the largely mundane music scene, they got together to create no frills skullcrushing tunes that doesn't follow any of the "rules" imposed on what a heavy metal band should sound like these days. 
Unlike traditional bands, both guitarists trade off their roles, each with their own distinctive and yet devastating sound. Also unlike traditional bands, the vocals are ridden with pain and realism, screaming yet coherent, and totally brutal. 
Doomy, thrashing, chaotic, and completely different than anyone else, 
Fog Wizard aren't out to impress you, they're just playing music for themselves. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fog+Wizard">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
