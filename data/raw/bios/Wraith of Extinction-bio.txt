Wraith of Extinction (or WöE) is a raw black metal band from the United States (Texas) which formed in 2006 as a solo project of Adversor (Guitars, Vocals, Drums). That same year the "Wraith of Extinction" demo was released through War Productions. In 2007 Zubhuman (Bass, Live Vocals) joined the wraithkult and contributed to the "Antichristian Resistance Front" demo. Currently (9/27/09) WöE is looking for a label.
