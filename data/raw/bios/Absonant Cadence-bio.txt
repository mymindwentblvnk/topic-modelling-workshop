Absonant Cadence was formed back in 1993, by Danny Riverin (guitar),
Dominique Bilodeau (drummer) and Dominique Simard (guitar). The next
to join was Eric Boily (Bassist) and the musicians line-up was complete. From
September 1993 to March 1995, they put out an advanced tape of 6
songs, all instrumentals.

In the beginning of may 1995, Pierre April (vocals) was the last addition
of the band. In December 1995, they were in studio to release a seven song
demo of a professionnal quality sound. ‘‘Emergence’’ was out in March 1996
on an independant label. In almost one year, they’ve sold more than 450 copies
all over the world.

The demo received good critics in the worldwide underground metal
scene. Zines. mags and radio stations have recognized this first effort as
an original one. Absonant Cadence plays a kind of techno death metal through
a blend of brutal and technical parts, always crowned by lyrics from the
sickness of society.

Since January 1998, Absonant Cadence is no longer a quintet, but a
quartet. Effectively, Danny left the band for personnal reasons, so Absonant
Cadence is now a one guitar act.

The awaited CD, titled " Inside out-life ‘‘ will see the day during the year
2000. Nine other songs knocking at your door and you’ll get the seven song
of the ‘‘Emergence’’ demo, all remixed.

Our cadence is higher than ever,what about yours ??!!!
Come into the world of this Inside out-life...
