Italian sextet Soul Takers softly delivers a passionate blend of metal, progressive rock and classical music, focusing their compositions on melody and emotivity, rather than mere virtuosity. The band was formed in mid-90s on behalf of Badalini sisters, Federica and Francesca (both professional pianists), but reached a stable line-up only in 2004, completing their identity with the theatrical voice of singer Dino Brentali and the enriching and dreamy violin of Jari Pilati. All these elements are exemplarily portrayed in their debut-album Tides, received by critic as a fine accomplished novelty. One year later italian label Dragonheart (Macbeth, Domine) granted them a record deal, which will lead to the release of their sophomore album, temporarily entitled Flies in a Jar, in early 2007.
