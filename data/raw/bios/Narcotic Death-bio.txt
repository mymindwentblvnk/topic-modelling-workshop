Narcotic Death are a female fronted progressive Doom/Death Metal band, formed in West Yorkshire, UK in 2007 by Alex, Rob and Tim Beatson in the uninspiring environment of Ossett Sixth Form College. Within the space of a couple of months, this line up was joined by Jack Smith on drums and Liam Murnin on rhythm guitar and together the band began writing material for their self titled EP. Unfortunately, soon after, Beatson left the band to pursue his other interests and Shaun MacGowan joined the ND line-up just in time for their first gig and the recording of the EP in June 2008.

ND’s first gig took place in Wakefield’s most iconic Metal Venue; The Snooty Fox, and the band went down well with all present, and received a very positive review from the gig organisers; Legions of Steel. ND then went on to support many excellent acts around Yorkshire and gained a reputable position in the local metal scene. Recording for their debut album, ‘Anthology of the Damned’ began in May 2009, although it was at this time that Jack and Liam announced their departure from the ND line-up and left to form their own band that would better suit their personal tastes.

After a small period of anxious deliberation, the position of lead guitarist was filled by Dan Eastwood and the position of Drummer by Dan Johnson of Naacht; both of whom have effectively redefined ND’s signature sound. With an extensive catalogue of new material, new arrangements of the original EP songs and the album ‘AOTD’ in the process of being mixed, ND stand to emphasise that they are still very much alive and more than capable of slaughtering all non-believers with their unique and emotionally torturous brand of metal.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Narcotic+Death">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
