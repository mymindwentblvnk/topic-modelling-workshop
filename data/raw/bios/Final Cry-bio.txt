FINAL CRY, founded in 1989, is a german thrash metal band and stands for sawing guitars, racing drums and a melodic, but still aggressive lead voice - It stands for fast, powerful Heavy Metal that mixes the Speed ​​& Thrash Metal of the 1980s with the dark Scandinavian Metal varieties of the 1990s. Final Cry stands for five metal freaks who remained loyal to the Metal Underground and hits the stage with full energy live performance.
