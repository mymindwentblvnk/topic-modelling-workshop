Gelka is the downtempo project of Alex and Sergio, aka Budapest residents Sándor Dömötör and Csaba Kürti. Their international debut came when Bruno chose their track Please Keep Your Ticket Till The End to appear on 2003's Café del Mar: Dreams 3 compilation.

In the course of the next five years they provided another four tracks to the various installments of this ever growing chill-out music series. It's probably where their music caught ear of Nightmares On Wax's George Evelyn, who released their full-length album Less Is More on his Wax On imprint in 2008.

It can be best described as laidback electronica with a handful of live elements such as flutes, guitars and vocal contributions by (among others) Ghana-born singer Sena.

The hungarian word "gelka" means "dream-like quality" but it was also the name of the general repair service for all household electronics during the pre-1989 era Hungary. The artists opted for it, because "it stands for our past, our present and our future now." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gelka">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
