BIOGRAPHY
Because of the different musical preferences, influences and band history of each of the band members, the sound of Ametheon is varied. The lyrics and melodies will catch the attention of many a gothic-devout, but during past concerts visitors unfamiliar with the genre have found themselves pleasantly surprised with the accessability of the music. The music of Ametheon envokes images of warm summer nights and luscious winter landscapes, taking you to another world...

Ametheon recorded the demo 'Crystal Cage' back in 2004 and then 'Other World' in 2006, which reflected Ametheon's new and more mature sound. Especially this last one was well received and resulted in several gigs throughout the Netherlands.  After a short break the band is now back on the stage with two fresh band members, fresh material and fresh energy.

Ametheon is ready for more!

THE NAME
Pronounciation: 'A me the on'

Etymology: Ametheon is derived from 'Amaethon', a presumed agricultural deity in Welsh mythology. Amaethon or Amathaon ( Welsh 'great or divine ploughman,farmer, labourer'), was a son of Don. In Culhwch and Olwen he was the only man who could till a certain field, one of the impossible tasks Culhwch had been set before he could win Olwen's hand. In the Welsh Triads he taught magic to his brother Gwydion.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ametheon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
