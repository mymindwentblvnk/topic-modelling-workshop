British Jungle producer, considered one of the true originators of the Jungle sound in the 1990s. His drum programming skills are exceptionally progressive when compared to other musicians of the same era. Though he never really became a major commercial success, few could match his production prowess. Tracks like Sound Murderer, R.I.P and Ricky were to influence a generation of new music makers.

In 2003 the label Planet Mu released the album Sound Murderer wich can be considered a tribute to this artist combining classic hits such as R.I.P. with unreleased tracks. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Remarc">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
