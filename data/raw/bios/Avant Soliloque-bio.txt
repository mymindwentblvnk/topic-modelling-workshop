Avant Soliloque is a one-man project of instrumental doom-black metal, toned with instances of classical-avantgarde elements. Aiming to express inner-landscapes through unconstrained imagination, thematically the project deals with synesthesia, the return to nature, the chromatic expression of a higher dimmension of existence, onthological questions, the essence of Universe and Being, fractal universes within the atom, in the journey of entwining man and universe in celestial harmony. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Avant+Soliloque">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
