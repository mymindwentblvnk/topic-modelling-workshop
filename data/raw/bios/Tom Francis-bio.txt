It's the space in between the notes that strikes you when listening to Tom Francis, the notes that breath and harmonies that suggest more voices than are present, the dancing guitar notes below the story that pulls you in and out of light and darkness. This is music to fall into and get lost in.
From barefoot festivals to candle lit bars Tom has been silencing audiences since he's taken his music to the stage, music best described as a unique blend of soul and folk, music that can draw you in with intimate finger picking and raw lyrics before raising you with a percussive, soulful chorus.
At the centre of the music are the lyrically intimate and poetic narratives that reflect and express the great and small themes of moving and changing through this life.
New Zealand born, now based in Byron Bay Australia, Tom has just finished his second record 'From Up There', following the release of his first album 'Wishing wells' in 2012. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tom+Francis">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
