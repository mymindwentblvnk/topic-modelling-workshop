Concrete Sox were a hardcore/ thrashcore/ crust punk band of the mid '80s hailing from Nottingham, UK. Fans often consider Concrete Sox an early style crossover thrash band, which later was popularized by other bands like Suicidal Tendencies. They mixed hardcore punk with huge thrash metal riffs (this is very evident on the band's earlier material, with a very huge Metallica worship sound on some songs). Concrete Sox were a very outspoken band, lyrically speaking about protecting the environment and animal rights. The band is best known for sharing the stage with bands like Heresy, Doom, Napalm Death, Antisect and other early crust punk/grindcore bands.  In 1991, they released a 4 song live 7" called "Lunched Out" on KY based label Desperate Attempt Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Concrete+Sox">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
