KOPERNIK as an ensemble - named after Nicolaus Copernicus (Kopernik in his native Polish) father of the Western model of heliocentricity and contributor to the way modern man views time and cycle - shares with the astronomer, not only a name, but the weight and gravity of carrying around town in their heads an undeniable discovery about the nature of how shit works: an uncovering of things constant, the recognition of a "new" silent authority around which we've always floated. KOPERNIK is the collaboration of BRAD LEWIS (owner of Pearineel Records, and of the band The Sight-Seers) on computer and TIM DELANEY (contributor to groups like Savath + Savalas, The Sight-Seers) on upright bass. The two Atlanta natives began their aesthetic and working relationship in college in Florida where they studied theater (LEWIS) and music composition (DELANEY) an accomplished acoustic bassist since the age of ten and taught by his grandmother ("Tim's grandmother rips on the upright too!"). It was at that time that their collaborations with other musicians laid the foundations for The Sight-Seers, an ensemble rolling out eclectic pop-rock and ambient recordings (some of which were used as the sonic foundations of DELAROSA + ASORA's, aka Scott Herren, Crush the Sight-Seers EP). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kopernik">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
