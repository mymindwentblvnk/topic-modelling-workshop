SKELT'S, metal band from Namur (Belgium) founded in 2009 by Dem & Ced.
After a few months of intensive work and rehearsals, a two-track demo is released in November.
The band played a handful of gigs throughout Belgium with bands such as Napalm Death, Do Or Die, Ultra Vomit, Waking the Cadaver, Macabre, After All, Fleshgod Apocalypse, …
Skelt’s is a mix of brutality and aggressivity. The band offers an eclectic set of songs and doesn’t care about the labels at all. 
August 2012, the first album is recorded at Jack Studio. The first effort of the band called "Letter to the Grim Reaper" will be released in February 2013.
