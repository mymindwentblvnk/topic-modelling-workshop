1. 8th Day

8th Day was an American R&B group from Detroit, Michigan.

The Holland-Dozier-Holland songwriting team had scored hits in 1970 with the group 100 Proof (Aged in Soul); when their song "Somebody's Been Sleeping in My Bed" became a hit, radio stations also began playing the tune "She's Not Just Another Woman". HDH wanted to release the song as another single but didn't want to hurt the sales of "Somebody's Been Sleeping in My Bed", so they released "She's Not Just Another Woman" on Invictus Records under the name 8th Day in 1971. The song became a hit, peaking at #11 in the U.S. charts, even though there was technically no group actually in existence by this name.[1]

A second song released under the 8th Day name, "You've Got to Crawl (Before You Walk)", also hit the charts later that year, and so HDH put together an actual group under the name, but their later recordings didn't sell nearly as well as the first two, and the group quickly fizzled after a few more minor hits. The group name was resurrected in 1983 for a Brian Holland and Harold Beatty production featuring Tyrone Douglas, formerly of the Undisputed Truth.
