Byam Klavor has existed since the beginning of this self-destructive and morally unconcious millenium,The band has been dedicated to playing the most genuine form of black metal as possible to the best of their capabilities.

The brutal wage against human existence that was found in many black metal bands,Is flowing plentifully from the bowels of Byam Klavor.This quality is a sign of true faith in black metal music. Live appearances made with bands such as Towering Inferno, The Absence, Origin, Animosity, Malevolent Creation, Unholy Ghost, Deicide, Hate Eternal, Krisiun, Cattle Decapitation, Kalibas, Mare, Daughters, Genghis Tron, ..etc

Draping themeselves in corpse-paint and battered medieval armor,A wall of sound, murmering tales of calamity,The decay of mother earth and morally unconcious beings,The cryptic yet inimitable Byam Klavor shall be near you soon.

*2005 demo release march 27th***********

"Into The Wilderness" was recorded in November of 2002,since the band has evolved with new members mastering all Byam Klavor's musical compositions.
