Beginning in 2003, the band Straight Razor Suicide was conceived. El Paso Texas, a small yet diverse city, filled with dusty days and blowing tumbleweeds, is home to various punk rock metal and rockabilly bands. Out of the masses came along three men with one thing on their mind, Psychobilly. Rocco, a stand up bass player singer and song writer, Eviltex a guitar player, singer and song writer, decided to get together and talk about the ideas each other had about starting a psychobilly band with heavy distortion and death metal style structure. The search was on for the right drummer. After many months Al Nasty was recruited, which had been in various style bands and previously a drummer for a mutual band as Rocco, the final key had been turned. 

Straight Razor Suicide is a meld of death metal and spaghetti western. Influences from Slayer, Pantera, Os Catalipticos, and Bauhaus to name a few. People from all walks of life enjoy watching the high energy stage shows that are preformed. Fitting into more than just the psychobilly category, crowds into punk rock, metal, goth, and rock and roll enjoy the music as well. 

The popularity of the group grows rapidly with each and every show played. Having played San Antonio, Austin Texas, Tucson, Pheonix Arizona, Las Vegas, and southern California with success, the feelings of broadening the out of town show list grows strong. Music is the passion that fuels the bands determination to be a strong player in todays psychobilly circuit. Pushing forward to reach a new level has this band working hard, dedicated to reaching new people and travel to different places. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Straight+Razor+Suicide">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
