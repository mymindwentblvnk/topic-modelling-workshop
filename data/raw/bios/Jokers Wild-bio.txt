Joker's Wild (A name used by at least 3 groups)

1) Joker's Wild was a mid-1960s Blues-rock band from Cambridge, England.

The lineup included guitarist David Gilmour, who went on to join Pink Floyd.

Their only releases were a privately-pressed, single-sided LP and single, of which only 50 copies each were made. A tape recording of the LP is held by the British Library's National Sound Archive. In June of 2005, a copy of the LP was sold on eBay.

Together with Jonathan King (producer) they recorded what was to be the UK cover of Sam and Dave's 'Hold On, I'm Coming' but the original was released in the UK so Jokers Wild's version never saw the light.
