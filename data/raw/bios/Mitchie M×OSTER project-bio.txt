Mitchie M, also known as Tucada, is a producer who became popular due to his very realistic tuning of Hatsune Miku. OSTER project, also known by her username Fuwafuwa Cinnamon (ふわふわシナモン), has been one of the leading Miku users since 2007.

Mitchie M's name is derived from The Jimi Hendrix Experience's drummer, Mitch Mitchell, and originally was "Mitchiell Mitchie" before shortening it. He started composing songs in high school in a band which made covers. However, he wanted to write his own songs. His biggest influence is Tom Jobim. He uses Logic Pro 9 to compose his songs. Mitchie M's popularity is steady with most of his videos quickly gaining at least 200,000+ views.

OSTER project was born November 24th, 1986. This producer's range of production is very wide; she produces not only original songs, but cover songs, arrangements, and even VOCALOID dialogue. She is a very eager and prolific producer. Her song "Koisuru VOC@LOID" was one of Miku's early hits and helped set the model of VOCALOID personification.
OSTER project was originally known as Futanari-P (ふたなりP) (the Japanese term for hermaphroditism). It was not until April 2010 that she disclosed her gender and switched to her current name. She did this in hopes that listeners would have a gender-neutral viewpoint of her works. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mitchie+M%C3%97OSTER+project">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
