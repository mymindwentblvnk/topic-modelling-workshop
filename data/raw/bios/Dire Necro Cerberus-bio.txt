The band was born in 2010 from the idea of David Victor Trosino and Fabio Mosca, inspired by the greatest band of Technical Brutal Death Metal (Decrepit Birth, Spawn Of Possession, Deeds Of Flesh, Dying Fetus, Necrophagist, Unmerciful etc.) The band was completed on March 2012 with the entry of Sacha Sarnacchiaro (Berith's Legion) at guitar and Luca Colucci (ex-Kadavar) on vocals. We released our EP on 20/06/12, and "Hold The Acanthos Down" single on 18/9/12. Our debut album "Dire Necro Cerberus I" was released in 2015. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dire+Necro+Cerberus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
