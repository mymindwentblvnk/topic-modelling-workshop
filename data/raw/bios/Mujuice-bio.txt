Mujuice is the musical alias of Roma Litvinov (b. 1983, Moscow). He is a student of graphic design and also works professionally in this field. 
He began his musical experience in early childhood by composing small piano pieces. Working without a formal musical education, he integrated his experience as a member of a hardcore guitar band with his first electronic music experiments while in his teens. 
Soon his computer composing took precedence over group music-making. His first efforts were arranged mostly by sampling methods, and he still prefers sampling to digital sound synthesis. Roma rejects any idea of himself as a strictly electronic producer, believing that contemporary artists should use all available resources. He uses his medium as a podium for the breaking digital composing stereotypes, borrowing eclectically from acoustic jazz and pseudo-symphonic music to experimental clicks'n'cuts, microsampling and glitch tech. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mujuice">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
