Zepsilon is a Japanese raw black metal band consisting of Necra (who also has another band Necraphilia, depressive black metal) on vocals and Z playing all the instruments. The project was started in 2005. So far Zepsilon has released one untitled demo in 2007, with lenghty tracks of raw black metal and unintelligible vocals consisting of (seemingly) improvised screams, howls, shrieks and various gargligs. It seems likely that there are no proper lyrics on this release at all.

The band has a MySpace page with limited information and some music: http://www.myspace.com/zepsilon <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/zepsilon">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
