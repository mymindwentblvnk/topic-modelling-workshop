Ava Inferi formed in 2005 in Almada, Portugal. The band was created  by Norwegian guitarist and songwriter Rune Eriksen (aka Blasphemer, Mayhem. 
The ultimate idea behind this incarnation was to release and channel all frustration and misery that life sometimes brings upon us, but also, and perhaps more importantly, to give birth to an entity that could be used freely and independently. A portal to the never-ending well of expression and creativity… As soon as the idea of Ava Inferi was put out and in motion, the formation completed itself quickly.
Besides Carmen Simoes (vocals), who was also a member of different Portuguese outfits such as ISIPHILON and POETRY OF SHADOWS, the other members; bassist Jaime Ferreira and drummer Joao Samora, followed shortly to complete the circle. Ava Inferi’s first release was 2006’s Burdens. The title described the collective soul of the band at the time, with its clearly shaped influences referring to the past and misshapenness of all kinds. The album was rooted in the essences of pain and fear, yet done with an embracing warmth and passion for their style, which further on earned them a good welcome from the press. In spring 2007, vocalist Carmen laid vocals on the re-recording of famous Portuguese band MOONSPELL’s “Under the Moonspell”. October 2007 sees the release of Ava Inferi’s sophomore album, which has everything gothic/heavenly voices aficionados can dream of: doomsday-laden riffs, ocean-swept fado-like passages, witchcraft, hauntingly beautiful melodies from both voice and guitars, and even hit-songs!
