There are very little information about Abnegate. The Italian band from Milan, currently splitted up, was formed in 1992 and the original line up showing in their first album "Insane Soul" from 1994, was Ermes Pecorari (vocals), Emilio Bonavia and Marco Trentacoste (guitars), Corrado Merlo (bass) and Alessandro Placido (drums). They released a second album in 1997, "New Kernel", but from the original line up only Ermes Pecorari and Emilio Bonavia were from the original line up. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Abnegate">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
