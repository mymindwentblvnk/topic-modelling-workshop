There is more than one band of the same name.

1)Influenced by harsh Industrial sounds, wonderous dream-like synthetic melodies, and Sensual Cinematic Atmospheres, GRAVEMACHINE came to life in late 2004 with aspiring promise. 
The first release by Gravemachine, 'Slut', is an ambitious breakthrough into the electronic music scene that is sure to please. Based around the title track, the hit song 'slut', the debut EP contributes 5 original songs (including the title track), and 3 remixes of 'slut' including a club mix and remix by whiteout.
