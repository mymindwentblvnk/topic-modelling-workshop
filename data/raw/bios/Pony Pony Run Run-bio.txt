Pony Pony Run Run is a French power pop band formed in Nantes, France in 2003. Their first album, You Need Pony Pony Run Run, came out on June 15th 2009 in France on their label 3Ã¨me Bureau featuring the single Hey you.

Their first demo CD was released in 2004. They recently decided to go back on tour, and are touring in Germany and France. During live performances they used to wear enormous sunglasses (like the band Devo) due to their "over-sensitivity to light on stage". It is said that one of their greatest influences is Weezer, especially the album Pinkerton. 

The band consists on:
#  G : guitar, lead vocals
#  A : bass
#  T : synthesizer
#  S : guitar, backing vocals (left in 2008)
#  F :drums (left in 2009)
