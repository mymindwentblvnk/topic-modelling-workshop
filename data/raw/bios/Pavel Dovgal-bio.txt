In 2008 Pavel got seriously involved in electronic music and other styles. This resulted in something unique, worth spending time and effort on. A mix of Hip Hop, various musical instruments and sounds, with unusual tonality and disharmony. His music is experimental, surprising and daring.
 The release in 2010 of his first solo album on Berlin  label - Project Mooncircle  aims to turn this local success into international recognition.
 Pavel’s music is a trip into a fable and his medium is the music of different genres: Hip Hop,Electronic, Techno and Downbeat. His work is free spirited and there are hints of feelings, allusions, enigma and mystery. We won’t get into the inner workings of his music, how it finds its way into the hearts and souls of the audience, the important thing is that it serves its purpose. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pavel+Dovgal">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
