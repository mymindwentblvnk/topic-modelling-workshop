Cosmic Atrophy started in the very beginning of 2008 with the rather simple and straightfoward idea of "playing some metal". Cory and Juan met and decided to see if they could get something to work for them, and came to the conclusion that playing oldschool influenced death metal with a bit of otherworldly touch to it is what they wanted. Fast forward half a year and 6 songs later and their debut full length album is complete. A deal was struck with both Suffering Jesus Productions and Metalbolic Records to release this album which is quite frankly a huge blessing to the CA duo; to have a distribution deal this early is just unspeakably excellent! Now the only thing to do is wait to see what the future holds for Cosmic Atrophy, who are still hard at work writing new material. Cosmic Atrophy signed with metal label Dark Descent Records and is planning to release their second album, which will be based on the H.P. Lovecraft Novella "At the Mountains of Madness". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cosmic+Atrophy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
