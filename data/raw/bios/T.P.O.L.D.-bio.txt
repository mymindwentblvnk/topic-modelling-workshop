T.P.O.L.D is an underground monster from the depths of Karelia, the region on the edge of north-western Russia. It embodies dark, sultry atmosphere of little shitty towns and all the absurd of existence in such a sad region as Karelia. Three young oldschool lunatics are making music based on pure oldschool death metal hatred and early grindcore fury with some strong influences of crust/stenchcore.
The band started to rehearse in 2004 with Sergey on guitars/vocals and Greg on drums. The goal was to make raw, dirty sounding death/grindcore and some crust elements appeared in music naturally. After recording many demos without any distribution T.P.O.L.D. was buried for two years and became active again only in 2007. Sometime later Dmitry joined the band on bass guitar, so the band had full line-up finally.
Up to this moment this line-up have recorded one demo-album (released in co-operating with KARJALAN BUNKKERI) consists of eight raw bulldozer-like songs entitled “From Fucking Soul” and have played a small amount of local shows. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/T.P.O.L.D.">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
