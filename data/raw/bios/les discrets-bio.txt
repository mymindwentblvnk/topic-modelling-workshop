Les Discrets (/le diskʀɛ/, French for The Discreet Ones) is a French shoegaze/post-rock musical project created and led by Fursy Teyssier as, “a platform gathering music and art.” Teyssier was the sole member of the band until 2009. Since then, they have released three albums: Septembre et ses dernières pensées (2010), Ariettes oubliées... (2012) and Prédateurs (2017).

Les Discrets was formed in 2003 as a musical side-project, beside Phest, of which Fursy Teyssier was a member, as a way for Fursy, who is also an illustrator, to express concepts similar to those found within his art. Fellow French musicians Winterhalter and Audrey Hadorn soon joined the line-up. Les Discrets signed a five album contract with German record label, Prophecy Productions, in April 2009. The band released a split EP with Alcest in December of the same year, and went on to release their first full-length album, Septembre et ses dernières pensées, in March 2010. According to the German Sonic Seducer magazine, the album features, “dark, romantic music that cannot be attributed to any single genre.” On July 18, 2010 Fursy posted an update on the official site stating that composition for a second album has been completed and that the studio has already been booked for its recording.

Both Fursy and Winterhalter were members of the now-disbanded Amesoeurs, and Fursy has also been a live member of Alcest until June, 2010 for which Winterhalter is a full-time drummer. In 2013, Teyssier announced that, in a common decision, both Winterhalter and live-bassist, Neige, were leaving the band to focus more on their main band, Alcest. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Les+Discrets">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
