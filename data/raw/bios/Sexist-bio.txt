Sexist was a traditional heavy metal band.  They formed in 1982 and disbanded in 1984.  Sexist was formed by Doug Pittam and his brother Tommy.  The band once featured Gilby Clarke (who would later be a guitarist in Guns N' Roses).  This didn't last for a while, so Pittam then decided to start Sexist over from scratch with Mike Zaputil  and then he got Jake E. Lee.  Lee didn't last long with Sexist and he left to join Rough Cutt.  Then Sexist was comprised of members of the band Energy.  Those members were Mark Andersen, Robbie Blackmore and Dan Mateik.  As a quintet, they released Demo (aka Demo "83) in 1983.  The song Fire and Wind was featured on Metal Blade's Metal Massacre III compilation.

Doug Pittam was fired due to alcoholism and a new vocalist named Robert Sykes joined.  They did not record anything after their only demo.  The band came back and then became known as Letchen Grey in 1984. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sexist">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
