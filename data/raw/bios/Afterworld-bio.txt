Established in 1993, the heavy metal band Afterworld saw light of day in Oulu, in northern Finland. The music incorporates sounds from different metal and heavy subgenres. The band members have different backgrounds from an even broader genre spectrum, ranging from heavy to classical music, which adds another layer of tints to the metal hue. The band members have been associated with bands such as Poisonblack, Kalmah, Riff Raff and Solution 13 in their past.

The single “To the Afterworld” stayed several weeks in the Top 10 of the official Finnish single chart in 1999 and the music video aired frequently on TV. Around the turn of the millennium, Afterworld nailed a record deal with the German Noise Records who have hosted Helloween, Stratovarius, and Kreator, and published the Afterworld albums “Dark Side of Mind”, and “Connecting Animals” in 34 countries worldwide with raging reviews. The US based Joe Petagno designed the cover art for the albums. He has previously designed album art for bands like Motorhead, Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd.

Afterworld has climbed on stage at many major heavy metal festivals, including Tuska and Nummirock, and toured together with bands like Sentenced and Embraze. After a long low key period Afterworld has reactivated itself and is currently recording its third full album. Afterworld has stayed pretty much in its original set up. The current line-up is Mika Kuokkanen (vocals), Petri Saasko (guitar), Immu Ilmarinen( bass), Marco Sneck (keyboards), and Jani Outinen (drums).
