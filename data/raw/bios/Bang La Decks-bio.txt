Bang La Decks kicked off the summer of 2012 with their huge release “Kuedon” on Ultra Music, which reached number one in Serbia and Greece while receiving major support by world class DJs such as Mat Zo and DJ Alvaro.

The duo did not stop there, another huge release "Utopia" hit the dance scene just in summer 2013 which has destroyed the lines between musical genres and is giving the European dance community something to talk about. 

"Utopia" reached no1 in iTunes Greece and no1 in Shazam Greece, and stayed on top for 10 weeks, and climbed to no1 in Russian Shazam charts and no2 in Serbia. It was released through Ultra Records at the beginning of 2014.

Shortly after, it got massive support from the DJ community with Avicii, Afrojack, Benny Benassi, Chuckie, Deniz Koyu, Jesse Voorn, Mat Zo, R3hab and more blasting Utopia in their sets all over the world. A full vocal version featuring Dominique Young Unique was released early June through Ultra Records and Epic (Sony) UK.

In addition the duo recently remixed Flo Rida’s single “How I Feel” delivering a full on club anthem once again. 

Their latest track called "Zouka" was released a few days ago. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bang+La+Decks">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
