Heir to the throne were a Deathcore band from manchester originally named "legacy Of Exile" that began in 2006 and split up in 2010. the band recorded a few times but never released a proper demo or EP, never the less heir to the throne maintained a strong following in the north west for the 4 years they were together.

"Formed in Manchester in the summer of 2006 under the former name “Legacy of Exile” founding members Jack (drums) Johno (guitars) and Levi (bass) started writing music with the intention of writing music that they thought there wasn’t alot of about at the time. It is easy to label any band and categorize music into a genre like “metal, deathmetal or hardcore” but what is not easy to do is create something unique. When the band changed its name to “Heir To The Throne” in early 2008, with the addition of new vocalist Kane Starr and a new devastating sound HTTT have used their time to good effect."
