ZeroCrowd (formerly known as Treachery) was formed in   1998 in Oulu, Finland. After many gigs and few demos band changed their name into ZeroCrowd and started to take the music seriously. One of the biggest headstones in the band’s history was releasing Inside -EP in 2004. The EP woke the media’s attention and it created the direction for the band’s music. Unfortunately only the small part of the band had a serious commitment for music at the time and some line-up changes were necessary. Next time ZeroCrowd recorded a split album with Dark Flood in 2006, and Minortone Entertainment took the band in the shelter. Once again when everything looked great for ZeroCrowd, the band had to speed down because of the current changes. The rhythm duo was replaced even two times within a year before Zerocrowd found a bass player and a drummer. Now the band has a permanent and excellent line-up and sounds better than ever.

ZeroCrowd plays rock-based metal with a kick-ass drive. One Lifetime – Thousand Losses is their newest masterpiece containing two fertile tracks. The single shows the fresh and sharpened side of ZeroCrowd with the new and complete lineup with Jarno and Veikko. One Lifetime – Thousand Losses is a taste of the following results of ten years existence in ZeroCrowd’s biography.

ZeroCrowd is going to release their debut album in 2009. In 2008 band is going to do live gigs as much as possible and preparing for their first full-length album. First taste from the album comes out next autumn when the band will release a download single worldwide.
