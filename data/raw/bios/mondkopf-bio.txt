Mondkopf (literally "moonhead" in German) is the alias of 25-year-old Frenchman Paul RÃ©gimbeau who was born in Toulouse. He is an electronic producer and remix artist whose name may already be familiar to many as a member of the Fluokids family. Their hugely influential blog and label have become a well-respected stamp of approval for new cutting edge artists.

He gained a cult following on the electronic music scene thanks to his thrilling remixes of The Golden Filter, The Teenagers, Grand National, Pony Pony Run Run and even Johnny Cash.

Having developed his own exciting sound, Mondkopf draws inspiration from experimental electronica pioneers such as Brian Eno and Vangelis, as well as innovative American Hip-Hop artists like Timbaland and J Dilla.

Mondkopf breaks away from other French dance acts to create his own exciting instrumental blend of deep rhythms and soulful melodies. His crunchy beats and complex orchestrations have won him comparisons to the likes of Apparat, Modeselektor and Kevin Shields. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mondkopf">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
