We're All Gonna Die is a hard rock band from Boston, MA formed in 1998. Comprised of vocalist/guitarist Jim Healey (also of Black Thai), bassist Jesse Sherman, and drummer Eman Pacheco. Former members include Russ Boudreau (bass) and Scott Healey (drums). Take heavy stoner groove, throw in a solid dose of hardcore anger and go for the throat menace, distill it all down to concentrate the intensity even more, and you have the We're All Gonna Die sound in all its evil/beautiful glory. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/We%27re+All+Gonna+Die">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
