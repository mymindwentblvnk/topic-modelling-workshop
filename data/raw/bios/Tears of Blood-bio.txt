At least  two bands use the name "Tears of Blood"

1.) Tears of Blood are from São Paulo, Brasil, and formed in the early 1990's. The music is 1980's inspired Gothic Rock with female vocals.

2.) Tears of Blood were founded in April 2002 in Oberhausen/Germany by Marcel Kremer and Marcel Brozeit.(Former members of  "Indication" www.theageofvenusrecords.com)  Sixth month later they already recorded the three track demo “Death shall rise”. It was produced by Klaus Spangenberger who is also the lead singer of the death metal band “Blood red angel” from Krefeld/Germany. This mini-album was very well respected by fans and critics. It was presented at several concerts and the crowd was almost blown away by this powerful music. After this exciting and also exhausting time “Tears of blood” decided that it was time for a creative break. Due to personal matters some members left the band. 

May 2004 the new line up was formed and the first gigs were played.Tears of blood shared the stage with some fine bands like Cataract,Mnemic,End of days,Personal Vendetta etc.....It was clear that the next release must be something special,so Tears of blood decided to enter the famous Midasstudios in Belgium (www.midasstudios.com) in April 2005. A lot of the legendary H-8000 bands recorded their records in this studio.( Liar,Deformity,Congress,Vitality and tons of other bands).The result is a four track cd,where you can find all the mixtures of the Tears of blood sound.A big special on this cd is,that Joost Noyelle aka Josh Congress (www.congresshc.be) do some lead vocals and play a very great guitar solo,and put the cd one step higher.Only one week later,the band filmed their first music video for the song "Kings will be kings".This video is a special bonus for the cd. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tears+of+Blood">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
