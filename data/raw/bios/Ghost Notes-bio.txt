1. Ghost Notes are an instrumental band from Brisbane, Australia. Forming in 2009, they make dynamic music which owes as much to folk, jazz, noise-rock, kraut, spaghetti-western soundtracks and various strains of 'experimental' music as it does to so-called post rock.

2. Ghost Notes is a hip-hop producer that has worked with Oh No, Guilty Simpson, M.E.D., Count Bass D, Wildchild, iCON the Mic King, and many others. Ghost Notes released a mixtape of remixes in 2009. The first official Ghost Notes-produced album, "A Brilliant Soul" by Astro, is set for release sometime in 2010.
