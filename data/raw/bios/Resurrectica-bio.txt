Resurrectica was formed in Bangkok, Thailand by Prince of Darkness and the "Fallen Angels"... (In memorized of those who fall from heaven's ablaze into the bareless prison of eternal darkness) We're come out at night, in the dark we're facing the Hell's Queen, with swords against her, and the crimson's grail pouring "his" blood against 'Him'... AWAKENING OF THE REBEL... "Rather to die and burn my soul than serve one"
