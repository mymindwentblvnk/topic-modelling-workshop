Shaded with elements of electronic, synthpop and indie rock, Elkland was an American band from Horseheads, New York, formed in 2003. Originally called Goat Explosion, the group took a new name from the nearby town of Elkland, Pennsylvania. Composed of Jonny Pierce, Joel Tarpin, Adam Kessler and Jesse Pierce, the band released one album, “Golden,” led by the single “Apart,” on the Columbia label. The band split in 2006, and frontman Jon Pierce subsequently teamed with former Goat Explosion bandmate Jacob Graham to form indie pop / surf rock band The Drums; their eponymous debut album surfaced in 2010. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Elkland">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
