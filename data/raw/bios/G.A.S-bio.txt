G.A.S was a Japanese hardcore band who were from Hiroshima and played hard, driving hardcore which helped define early Japanese hardcore. They first released their No More Hiroshima 7″ flexi (Jitsatsu) in '83. After this came out, they relocated to Tokyo and got a new singer and guitar player and released The Day After 7″ flexi. More member changes (including Tatsu of Gastunk) were to come and the release of an LP and an appearance on the infamous "The PUNX" compilation cassette (with G.I.S.M., Cobra and Lip Cream). They broke up in 1986, but seem to be back together presently, playing live in Japan. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/G.A.S">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
