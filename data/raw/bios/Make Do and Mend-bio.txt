Make Do And Mend is an American post-hardcore band from West Hartford, Connecticut, formed in 2006. They first released a 6-track EP (We're All Just Living) in 2007, and then a follow-up EP (Bodies Of Water). They gave it for free online, and then Panic Records called to help out with an official release, which came true in March 2009. At the end of the year, the band entered the studio to record two songs for a split album with Touché Amoré, released September 2010 on Panic Records. On October 26th, 2010, Make Do And Mend released their first full-length album, entitled End Measured Mile--a split label release between Paper + Plastick and Panic Records.
The band announced they had signed with Rise Records and would be recording a new album in February 2012. On June 19th, 2012, the band released a new record, (Everything You Ever Loved). While technically members of "The Wave", along with La Dispute, Touché Amoré, Pianos Become the Teeth, and Defeater, the band has since clarified that "The Wave" was merely an inside joke between those bands and does not represent a particular movement or subgenre in post-hardcore.
