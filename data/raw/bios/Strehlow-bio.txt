“I make sounds that i like. Everything I know I learned sitting at my macbook in my mothers basement, all self taught. I prefer to create as much of it from scratch as I can, but if I hear a sound I like, I dont find any harm in sampling. As long as what you make of it is original and its something you enjoy who cares?”  - Strehlow <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Strehlow">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
