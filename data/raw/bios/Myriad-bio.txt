Myriad = Aussie Progressive Rock Duo

MYRIAD is a progressive rock duo from Brisbane, Australia.
Evoking the epic spirituality of artists such as YES and TANGERINE DREAM, and with an energetic, space-rock attack reminiscent of 70's RUSH, MYRIAD aims to create deep and reflective music to take you on a soul journey.
MYRIAD has recorded two albums to date; the dreamy 'Sea Of The Sinking Sun' and the epic 'Floating On Ascending Plains'.
Extended, multi-part compositions featuring spacious, layered guitars, other-worldly analogue synths, commanding, detailed drum work, ethereal melodies and majestic themes contribute to a deep and reflective yet energetic sound that recalls the sensibilities of 70s progressive rock artists such as early PINK FLOYD, GENESIS, Mike OLDFIELD and many others!

In 2011, MYRIAD members Matt HEINDORFF (guitars, synths, vocals) and Steve CLARKE (drums) are recording a brand new album. The new album will feature the expansive sound and contemplative themes of previous albums, with new ideas and influences to take you on a musical journey with some surprising destinations!
