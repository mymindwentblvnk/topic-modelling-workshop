William Rajan, better known by his artist name Memro, is an emerging drum & bass/liquid funk producer from Kent in the United Kingdom. His tracks have been featured on many of the genre's promotion channels on YouTube, such as Liquid Musick, skankandbass and UKF Drum & Bass.

By the age of 14, Memro had produced the track which was played on BBC Radio One, a national radio station in the UK, on Fabio & Grooverider's show. While at first his track, 'Altitude', was mistaken for a Marky & S.P.Y. remix, although this was later corrected.

His first single, Homecoming/Trick Of The Tail, was released on June 28, 2010 on Liquicity Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Memro">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
