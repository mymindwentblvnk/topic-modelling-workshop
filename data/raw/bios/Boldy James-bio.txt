James Clay Jones III (born August 9, 1982), better known by his stage name Boldy James, is an American rapper from Detroit, Michigan. His debut album My 1st Chemistry Set was released on October 15, 2013. 

Boldy James was born James Clay Jones III on August 9, 1982, in Atlanta, Georgia to his parents James Clay Jones Jr. and Toni K. Broadus. In 1983, Jones and Broadus returned to their original home of Detroit, MI with their son after Jones was wounded in the line of duty serving as a police officer. They resided on the Eastside of Detroit with James’ grandmother. In 1989, James’ parents separated and his mother sent him and his younger sister to live with their father to live on Detroit’s westside on Stahelin Hell Block near McNichols Rd and the Southfield Freeway. James’ love for music came to the forefront at the age of 12, when he performed in a middle school talent show and begun writing his first raps shortly after. He attended high school at Detroit Cooley, and dropped out after the 9th grade. He got the name Boldy James from his friend from his block, James Osely III, who people in the neighborhood called Boldy. He didn’t rap, he just sold cocaine, and “I liked the name because his name was James too,” says James. When his friend was murdered he decided to carry on the name using it to rap.

In 2009, Boldy James first big break on the national scene came in the form of 2 features on The Cool Kids and Don Cannon mixtape Merry Christmas, on the songs “BBQ Wings” and ”Tires”. That was followed up by his record “Gettin Flicked” appearing on The Cool Kids’ 2010 mixtape Tacklebox. Also in 2010 he was featured on the Chip tha Ripper song “Fat Raps” remix alongside Big Sean, Asher Roth, Dom Kennedy and Chuck Inglish. Boldy James and Cool Kid member/producer Chuck Inglish are cousins. On May 24, 2011, Boldy James released his solo debut mixtape Trappers Alley Pros and Cons. The project went on to be named by Pitchfork as one of 2011′s Most Overlooked Projects. On February 27, 2012, he released his follow up mixtape, Consignment. On March 5, 2013, he released an EP titled Grand Quarters. On October 15, 2013, he released his debut album, My 1st Chemistry Set entirely produced by The Alchemist.

He has released the mixtapes Trapper's Alley (Pro's & Cons) and Consignment: Favor For A Favor. He is known for his deep voice and effortless flow over beats with a heavy bass (ie Chuck Inglish produced songs). He is also known for his appearance on J Dilla's latest album, Rebirth Of Detroit. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Boldy+James">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
