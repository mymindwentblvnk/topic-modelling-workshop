1) Primitive, murky minimal electronics which was originally released in 1981 on the legendary, Osaka based Vanity Records (early Sympathy Nervous, Dada, Sab, BGM, the mindblowing Music Box Set, etc..). The labels stock-in-trade (aside from a few titles such as Aunt Sally) was raw, electronic experimentation which sounds impressively comtemporary when put up against current glitch, minimal techno and laptop artists (this experimentation included toying with ideas of fidelity [or the lack thereof as is evident on first side of this record], recording techniques [hard panning, volume and frequency drop outs], etc..). Tolerance, consisting of Junko Tanage and Masmai Yoshikawa, were the only band that released a second album on Vanity. Their first LP (Anonym, 1979) was supposedly the source for the title of the second Nurse With Wound LP, To The Quiet Men From A Tiny Girl.

2) Lawrence Whitehead, also known as Tolerance, is a producer, DJ and musician from Cardiff, South Wales. His unique tracks seamlessly blend orchestral and synthesised elements, and feature distinct melodies which are emphasised by punchy beats and rolling basslines. These tracks have caught the attention of high profile DJs, one of whom, the multi-award-winning N-Type, has signed up several of Tolerance's tracks for release on his label Wheel & Deal Records. His debut release will feature three tracks, including the anthemic Timeship and Chamber of Secrets, on a limited vinyl pressing, with the digital release consisting of Timeship and Dejection. With massive support from the likes of N-Type, Rinse FM and the rest of the dubstep elite, this is set to be a big release.

3) Progressive rock/metal band from Caracas, Venezuela, formed in 2013. They released their first album in 2013 (entitled "When Time Stops"). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tolerance">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
