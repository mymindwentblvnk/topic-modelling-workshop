To Cast A Shadow hail from Norway and play Gothic Doom Metal in the vein of early-The Gathering with several influences found in bands like Autumn or The 3rd and the Mortal. The music is very melodic, sometimes playful, always vast and grindingly sad at times.
Despite their being founded in  1990, it took them until 2007 to finally release their debut album "All Alone".
Lyrical themes on the 9 songs include lost love, the different shades of human nature, as well as some social observations - all delivered in a rather doomy fashion. Most of the vocals are sung by Camilla Granlien, whose vocal range is comparable to Anneke van Giersbergen rather, than to the higher "elven" style of other bands in that genre.

To Cast A Shadow are currently unsigned.
