Bonegrinder was founded in the summer of '03 as a result of a jamming session. The members wanted an outlet for their metal needs and as they found out that the chemistry between them was working well, they decided to put up a band. Bonegrinder is a sum of four metalheads' opinion of bonegrinding, crushing, low-tone, intensive metal. Expect grimy guitar sounds, grinding basslines, angry vocals and fierce drumming from this four-piece metal band. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bonegrinder">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
