Founding member and composer Olivier Wittenberg (drums) started Manic Movement in 1993 and worked with various musicians on the different albums. Filip De Graeve (keyboards) has become a permanent member since 1998 and assists Olivier in the arrangements and orchestration. Other current members are Frédéric Ost (lead guitar), Jérémie Vasile (rhythm guitar) and Filip Pieters (bass guitar). Vocals representation by Virginia Fantoni.

Manic Movement was originally formed as a trash metal band. Over the years, the band evolved from melodic death metal with male grunt vocals to female vocals in 2006, creating more accessible songs and expanding its musical spectrum.

The upcoming album of Manic Movement ‘Dark Glitter’ is a contrast of dark and heavy guitar-oriented music with bombastic keyboards, enlightened by shimmering and original female vocals.
