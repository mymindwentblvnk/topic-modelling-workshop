Hungarian neoclassical metal ensemble, founded in 1987.

Classica was formed in Budapest in November of 1987. They were the earliest representatives of neoclassical metal in Hungary. Their greatest inspiration was the music of Yngvie Malmsteen, apart from bands like Deep Purple, Rainbow and Metallica. After a handful of demos, compilation apperances and a first place finish in a talent show, they enjoyed a sudden burst of popularity, at which point they were signed for a full album deal by the Hungarian Record Factory. The recordings were completed, and a video/single was made for the song "Fém Gyermekei", however the album did not get a release due to various circumstances, including the mandatory military conscription of Zoltan Fejes (due to which the band was unable to tour after the planned release), an unfavorable interview from singer Karoly Szutorisz and the fall of the Iron Curtain, which caused some of the previously negotiated deals to be sidetracked and eventually buried.

Not to be completely detracted from success, the group underwent several lineup changes in the following years, first the departure of Károly Szutorisz, who was replaced by Zsolt Molics. They could not secure another record deal, only a compilation appearance entitled "Rock From The Heart Of Europe". Soon after, both Zsolt and Zoltán Fejes (guitars) departed, which led to the welcoming of Ablonczy Mihály on vocals and Nagy Péter on guitars, as well as the change on bass from Tibor Hertel to Tamás Éber. With these, a change of musical style followed. The record entitled "Classica" was released on a minor label, and showcased a more laid-back music much alike to Scorpions. A video was made for the song "Ne Hidd, Hogy Jó Neked".

Another series of line-up changes ensued in the coming years, and another change of direction to a more heavier and progressive approach, attributed to Dream Theater's music. The band recorded another demo in 1994 which got the attention of a label operating out of Luxembourg. They financed what was going to be the third full-length record of Classica, entitled "Iron World". However soon after the production concluded, the label reportedly filed for bankruptcy and the album was shelved indefinitely.

The band had infrequent live appearances up to 1999 and was proceeding with demos in 2000 with Zoltán Fejes as guest, however nothing substantial materialised and the band was put on halt.

In 2007, through the intervention of several people a deal was made with Hammer Records to release all three albums in a box set, entitled "Antológia". This was the first time 2 out of those 3 records were available to the public in their entirety, with added bonuses of several demo recordings, the 3 songs recorded with Zsolt Molics for a compilation, and a live version of the song "Megszállott".
