From the notorious Dead End Drive on the Southside of Houston, we have Killa Kyleon.  With a very agressive yet intricate, gangster, raw and witty flow, he is one of the souths hardest hitters.  Growing up under the wings of such musical geniuses as Dj Screw & Big Hawk (RIP), Big Pokey, and many of the other original SUC members, there is no wonder to why this cat hits it out of the park every time he steps up to the plate.  If you're looking for someone to represent the real gangsta stuff that will keep your head bobbin, then you're in the right place. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Killa+Kyleon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
