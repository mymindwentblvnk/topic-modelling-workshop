Jack’s Family formed in the summer of 2002 when songwriters Kelly Jones and Jean-Paul De-Havilland returned to Colchester from the West Country. Kelly had become tired of the restrictions of classical music so and needed to break out. After 8 weeks of intensive rehearsal, a four piece featuring Cary Marchall on bass, and Nicholas Spall recorded the self financed ‘Poetry of Souls’ album.

On 27th December 2002 Kelly and Jean-Paul were involved in a bad car crash near Huntingdon. Close friend Darren went to pick them up and that evening was asked to join the band on piano and keys. Darren had played all over the world with punk folk outfit Blyth Power then toured extensively with Kelly in The Wickermen so was the perfect choice.

At the start of 2005 Cary emigrated to the US and the search began for a replacement. At the beginning of April JF auditioned Braintree bassist Rich Potter and offered him the job. Now a year on the band are gigging as far afield as Manchester, Wales and the Midlands as well as closer to home across East Anglia including Ipswich Music Day 2005 and the 2006 Cambridge Strawberry Fair festival. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jack%27s+Family">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
