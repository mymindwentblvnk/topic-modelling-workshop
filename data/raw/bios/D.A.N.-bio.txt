Daigo Sakuragi, Junya Ichikawa and Teru Kawakami formed D.A.N. in April 2014 in Tokyo, Japan. Drawing on the style and sophisticated sounds of a variety of artists, the band is part of a new generation of Japanese musicians pursuing a timeless, minimal-mellow club sound. 
The band's first release was the independently produced "D.A.N. Zine" (2014), which was followed by "EP" (2015) – their debut EP – and a performance at Rookie A Go Go at Fuji Rock Festival 2015. Following much anticipation, the band released their self-titled debut album in April 2016. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/D.A.N.">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
