Rathergood.com was founded at the dawn of the new millenium by handsome kittenista Joel Veitch. Since then its unique menagerie of animals and songs - particularly his singing kittens and moon-obsessed Spongmonkeys - have developed a worldwide cult following.

From its mircaculous conception in a lowly shed at the bottom of the garden, Rathergood was catapulted to superstardom by the raging success of the lunar-loving, dentally challenged Spongmonkeys.

The core of the world of rathergood.com, its beating heart, is and has always been the musical collaboration between Joel and his brother Alex. This partnership has spawned such moving and emotional classics as "The Wrong Bananas" and "The Fishy Song" as well as the heart-pounding excitement of "Have You Got an Ocelot" and "Zoology Dragon".

Finally we are able to offer the musical fruits of this greatest of all collaborations to the teeming masses of the world. The world will be forever a better place.
