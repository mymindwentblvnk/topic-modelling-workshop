Jordan O'Jordan (born Jordan Smith) is an American acoustic show-tunes musician from Waverly, OH.  

Armed with either banjo, autoharp, piano or acoustic guitar, O'Jordan crafts vaudeville entertainment out of life's mundane grind and his own whimsical imagination. Everyone from Woody Guthrie and Tiny Tim to Devendra Banhart and Raffi share space in  O'Jordan's compositions that juggle humor, drama, sharp wit and lyrical poetry into an assemblage. His songs come from imaginary conversations among Kermit the Frog, Mama Cass, Coco Chanel, Pete Seeger, various old flames who are now ghosts, neighborhood trees, new suitor ghosts, and Dorothy Parker.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jordan+O%27Jordan">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
