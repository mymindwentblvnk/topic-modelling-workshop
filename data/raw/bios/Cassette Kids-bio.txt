Cassette Kids have been causing a ruckus on the Sydney scene since winning the Unearthed Sydney 2008 Big Day Out Competition. With their unique sound that sits somewhere in between Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Klaxons and Björk, the quartet have been turning heads with a show that brims with style, vigour and passion. They’re only just breaking into their stride, and after whipping up stages all over the country on The Presets’ sold-out national tour, they’re currently on National tour promoting their debut 'mini' album 'We Are'.

Band members include: Katrina Noorbergen, Daniel Schober, Daniel Deitz, Jacob Read-Harber <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cassette+Kids">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
