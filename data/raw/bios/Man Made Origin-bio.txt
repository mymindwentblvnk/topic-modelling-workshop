Man Made Origin is a five-piece Progressive Metal band from Dundee, Scotland, who offer a groundbreaking mix of Death Metal, Black Metal, Post-Metal and Progressive Rock which effortlessly bridges the gap between the underground and mainstream. They have recently released a music video for the song "The Betrayal" and are currently working on material for their second full length album.



Formed in late 2008 at Dundee University band society, the original quartet quickly began work on their debut record 'State of Nature'. This first offering was recorded in the summer of 2009 and released that November. It quickly sold out receiving an enthusiastic response from both music fans and critics alike.

Soon after, work began on record number two - entitled 'False Consciousness' - which was to reflect the band's growing confidence and a new level of ambition; the record was to come with a 200 page book of short stories set in the sci-fi universe in which the record was set. After two years of writing, with the new material being debuted live throughout this period, the band returned to the studio in Summer 2011 with local singer/songwriter Sarah Coloso guesting on multiple tracks. Released in late November 2011, this new recording marked a far more in depth and experimental process with a much higher production level than hitherto which, when combined with the ebook of short stories embedded on the CD called 'Tales of the Verse' , resulted in an entirely new level of immersion.

Man Made Origin entered 2012 with the announcement of the permanent addition of Sarah Coloso's powerful voice and keyboard talents and a growing and extremely positive critical response to 'False Consciousness''.  The band has already entered the next phase of its exciting creative evolution. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Man+Made+Origin">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
