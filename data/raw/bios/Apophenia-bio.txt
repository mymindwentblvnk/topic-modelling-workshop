The band captures a very unique portrait of city lifestyle that can only come from one of the most complicated cities in the world… A place of broken beauty and irony, beautiful crazy people with a spirit to pursue, a spirit to attain. Right now is the time for us to shine our light on our ever most self-fulling destiny. Nothing will not stop four hard working men from this life long path dedicated to art, regardless of the medium. We are in a war in our minds to attain our next opportunity (with a record in hand) to put on the best, most insane shows we can possibly put on, every night, not a stone unturned, not a kid left feeling less motivated to do something…To do anything, to get up, to stand up for something and to live your dream; to do anything out of the ordinary.
