Taymor Travon McIntyre (born June 16, 2000), popularly known as Tay-K, is an American rapper from Arlington, Texas.

Born in Long Beach, California, his father and mother were both Crip gang members. During his time growing up, his father was imprisoned. However, after he was released, they all moved to Arlington, Texas, in search of a better environment, a place that would set the stage for Tay’s music career. Tay-K got his start in music at a young age. He worked as one half of the group Daytona Boyz alongside his longtime friend PiMPYZ in middle school and early high school. While he gained a local buzz, Tay only began to get nationwide attention due to his conflicts with the law. As a 15-year-old, he was accused of killing a female college student in a drive-by shooting on January 1, 2016. As a minor at the time, he was charged with house probation. However, Tay-K cut off his ankle monitor and fled to New Jersey, unnoticed for over a month. It was during this time he recorded his breakout hit “The Race,” bragging about his escape of the law. Eventually, he was arrested on June 30, 2017, and extradited back to Fort Worth, Texas.

After a trial lasting multiple years, Tay-K was sentenced to 55 years in prison after being found guilty of the murder of 21-year-old Ethan Walker. He will not be eligible for parole until he serves at least half of his sentence. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tay-K">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
