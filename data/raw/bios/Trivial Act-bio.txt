Trivial Act is a progressive metal band from Arendal, Norway. Their influences are based on progressive metal greats such as Dream Theater, Fates Warning, Queensrÿche and Voivod and traditional metal legends Judas Priest and Iron Maiden.

Trivial Act was formed in 1993 by guitarist B. Andreassen and H. Salvesen in Arendal, Norway. On October 27, 1997, they released Mindscape which was praised in 2006 as "a classic release in Norwegian Metal" by Scream Magazine. A month later, Erik Wroldsen left the band for personal reasons and was later replaced by drummer Stian Kristoffersen of Pagan's Mind. A year later, Sven Ole Heggedal left the band for the same reasons and replacing him was bassist Steinar Krokmo also of Pagan's Mind. A month after Steinar joined, Håkon Salvesen left the band. In 2001, they recorded a 3-song demo, Thoughts in Lyrics, and then went on hiatus. After a long break, the band started recording the follow-up to Mindscape. In November 2008, Kim Isaksen left and the band is currently searching for a new vocalist to replace him. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Trivial+Act">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
