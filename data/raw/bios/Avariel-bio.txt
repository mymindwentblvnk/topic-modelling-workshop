Bold and dynamic, Avariel is Boston’s Symphonic Metal experience. Avariel brings forth an original sound derived from both American and European metal influences, united with a distinct classical element and soaring female vocals.

Dedicated to producing music that balances accessibility with creativity, and melody with aggression, Avariel has spent the last five years putting together a skilled lineup and refining a powerful sound. After releasing a self-produced demo in 2006, Avariel spent the next two years playing stages all over New England. During that time, the band continued to focus on writing its arsenal of material.

In 2010, the band maintains its fierce devotion. With more upcoming performances, Avariel will continue to share an intense live sound and gain momentum, while preparing to release a debut full-length album, “The Dawn."
