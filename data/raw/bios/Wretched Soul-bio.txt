Wretched Soul was formed in late 2008 amid the mist-veiled marshes and ruined medieval ramparts of Kent, Southern England. In 2011 the band has begun recording their debut album with producer legend Chris Tsangarides (Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, King Diamond etc.). Taking their brand of Heavy Metal to the masses, Wretched Soul never fails to wreck-necks and evoke the true spirit of Metal supporting the likes of Blaze Bayley, Beholder, Eastern Front and Sarah Jezebel Deva.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wretched+Soul">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
