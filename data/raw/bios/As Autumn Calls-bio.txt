As Autumn Calls was formed in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada in 2005. After 3 years of writing together the band recorded their first full length album titled An Autumn Departure. This edition was never released.

In the spring of 2009 As Autumn Calls began writing and recording a three song EP titled Emotionless. Emotionless saw the band move towards a darker, bleaker sound. The EP was self produced and released in December 2009.

In the spring of 2010 the band signed with the German underground label Naturmacht Productions and welcomed drummer Darren (Finnr's Cane, Wolven Ancestry) to the line-up. During this time the band also re-recorded An Autumn Departure and released it through The Northern Cold Productions as a limited edition cassette in March 2011. An Autumn Departure was also released on CD with all new album artwork in May 2011 through Naturmacht Productions.

In the Fall of 2011 Brendan joined the band as a second guitarist and for the first time AAC featured a full line-up. With the new line-up in place the guys began work on their second full length release "Cold, Black & Everlasting" which was released in October 2013 through Naturmacht Production's doom metal sub label Rain Without End Records.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/As+Autumn+Calls">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
