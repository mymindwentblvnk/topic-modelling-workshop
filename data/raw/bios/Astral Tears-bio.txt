Astral Tears: This France based band was co-founded in the late 2009 by Max(Guitars) & Beyza(Vocals) on the concept of a Progressive & Melodic Metal genre; to be best described by the band that is heavily influenced by the well known bands such as Dream Theater, Killswitch Engage, Avenged Sevenfold and Lacuna Coil.

Soon after releasing several songs and videos covering their influences and a few original productions, G-Rem(Bass Guitars), Jelly(Drums) joined the band and immediately entered an Independent Studio (mixed by Max, mastered by Tower Studios in Montpellier, France) where they recently have written & recorded 12 new songs to be released as their first album. "It will sound much different than previous demo songs such as 'Desire' and 'Awake' with a much heavier sound and energy similar to the recently released 'Hate the Enemy' song", says Max.

Astral Tears has already released the 2011 teaser video for 'Sinner' which has been generating positive review by fans and associates of the band as they await the soon to be released full length video which the band described the creation of this video in late October, 2011 as being recorded in the "freezing cold(- degree) temperatures" in France at the time.

Stay tuned to Astral Tears on their various profiles for latest news, development and coming releases on their soon to be released album starting with the lead song & video for 'Sinner' which will surely bring Astral Tears into the music industry with a strong presence.
