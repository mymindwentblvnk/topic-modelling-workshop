Stricklin is by no means new to the game. His career as an emcee started in Milwaukee during a time when hip-hop ruled the East Coast. His lyrical style is just as unique and eclectic as some of his musical influences which include Jay-Z, Kool G Rap, Big Daddy Kane, Chuck Berry, and Bootsy Collins.

He's been putting it down since he was 14 years old and made his official debut into hip-hop in 1999 on Tommy Boy Records. Featured along side Royce da 5'9" on Tommy Boy's Black Label, Strick as he was known then, established himself as an undeniable talent.

His rapid fire delivery and witty metaphors began to garner the attention of mixtape DJs around New York. He started surfing the underground mixtape circuit, dropping verses for some of the games most respected DJs.
One of these verses caught the attention of Masta Ace and a year later Stricklin was featured on Ace's 2001 release Disposable Arts.
The two songs he created with Ace lead to Stricklin, along with Punch & Words, accompanying Ace on the 2001 Disposable Arts Tour through Europe.

Since that time he has been featured on Ace's follow up album A Long Hot Summer (M3 Records) and sparked a buzz overseas in countries such as England, France, Sweden, Switzerland, Denmark, and Germany.

Doing well over 60 shows in the last 3 years has prepared him well for his solo debut, which will to be released on M3 Records. His goal for 2005 is to continue to build upon the buzz created and reach new fans.

"I want to create music everyone can move to," states Stricklin.

eMC (which features Stricklin, Punchline, Masta Ace, and Wordsworth) released their debut album The Show in 2008, and has received critical acclaim.

In the summer of 2010 Strick released the single I Be Damn featuring The Bundies as a free download on www.m3hiphop.com <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Stricklin">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
