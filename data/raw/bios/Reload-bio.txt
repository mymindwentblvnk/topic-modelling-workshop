There is more than one artist called Reload: 1) Ambient/Electronic collaboration between Mark Pritchard and Tom Middleton. 2) Crossover/nu-metal band from France. 3) Metal/Rock/Progressive Metal band from Poland

1) Reload, originally first appeared in 1993, was a Mark Pritchard solo project. Later, Tom Middleton joined Pritchard on some of his Reload releases, and "& E621"(the name of a chemical flavour enhancer) was added to specify Middleton's involvement/flavour enhancement on a track (Reload & E621 - similar to the set-up with Link & E621). Eventually, as Tom became more heavily involved on the Reload "A Collection of Short Stories" album, the "& E621" was scrapped, and Reload came to mean both Mark Pritchard and Tom Middleton.
All four Reload Remixes (not including the two on the Mystic Institute "Cyberdon EP") were done by both Pritchard and Middleton, jointly. 

Reload, in its current incarnation, is again, Mark Pritchard solo, with a pending release on Warp records scheduled tentatively for 2011.

The Pair is probably most well known as Global Communication, releasing ambient and house music. Their debut LP, Global Communication - 76:14 is one of the most acclaimed albums from the ambient music genre and from 1990s electronic music in general.

As a duo they have also recorded as Jedi Knights making new electro, as Secret Ingredients making House Music, as The Chameleon making chilled out drum-n-bass, and Link & E621.  Together they formed the Evolution Records Label and Universal Language Records Label.  They "split up" in 1997 to pursue solo careers, but "reunited" in 2006 to release the Fabric 26 DJ-Mix Compilation.  In October of 2010 Middleton and Pritchard announced they would be officially reuniting with touring live performances and DJ sets, as well as forthcoming new recordings (as Global Communication).

Mark also records/has recorded as Link, Harmonic 313, Troubleman, N.Y. Connection, William Parrott, and Roberto Edwardo Turner(The Returner).  His other collaborative efforts include Africa Hitech with Steve Spacek[/artis], Harmonic 33 and Use of Weapons with Dave Brinkworth, Series 7 with Stephen Horne, Shaft with Adrian Hughes, Vertigo with Danny Breaks, 28 East Boyz with Kevin Hann, Chaos & Julia Set with Dom Fripp, Mystic Institute with Paul Kent, and Pulusha with Kirsty Hawkshaw.

Tom also records/has recorded as Cosmos, Amba, The Mod Wheel, The Rebus Project, Schizophrenia, E621, and Spiritcatcher. Tom has worked collaboratively with Matthew Herbert and Mark Darby releasing one eponymous EP as Fog City. As Schizophrenia Tom collaborated with Aphex Twin on one track from his Analogue Bubblebath 1 EP.
