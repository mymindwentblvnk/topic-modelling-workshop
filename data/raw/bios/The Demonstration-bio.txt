The Demonstration and KILLWHITNEYDEAD share all of the same band members (except their vocalists), but not the same sound. In The Demonstration, you will find technical, talent-ridden harmories and melodies accompanied by ferocious and scathing breakdowns as is the norm for similar bands in the area. However, Trevor's unique and gritty growls and the band's tech-metal flavor make them stand out amongst the crowd.

Many people seem to believe that The Demonstration were signed to Tribunal Records because they were also in KWD, but that is not the case. Founder, Matt, discovered them and wanted to sign them before ever learning of how much the guys love Killwhitneydead. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Demonstration">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
