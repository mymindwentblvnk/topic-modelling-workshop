BC Camplight is the moniker of songwriter Brian Christinzio, originally from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States, but now based in Manchester, United Kingdom. 

His 2005 album Hide, Run Away was released by One Little Indian and featured Cynthia G. Mason on vocals. It was hailed by critics around the globe as one of the best records of the year. Time Magazine called Christinzio "a name to become synonymous with star quality". The follow-up, Blink of a Nihilist, was released in 2007.

In recent years BC Camplight re-located to England, where he signed a record deal with Bella Union and released his third and fourth albums, How To Die In The North (January 2015) and Deportation Blues (August 2018).

The BC Camplight live band consists of Christinzio (piano/vocals) and Mancunians Hattie Coombe (vocals), Stephen Mutch (bass), Jonno "Espranto" Prestbury (Guitar), Adam Dawson (drums) and Robbie Rush (keyboard/guitar). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/BC+Camplight">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
