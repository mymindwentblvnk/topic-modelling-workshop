Complimented as “charmingly arrogant” by some and “hard working showmen” by others - The Milwaukees make music for the masses: engaging, raw and instantly approachable. Sonically they live between the Foo Fighters and the Faces, while influences like the Who and the Clash permeate the band’s explosive live sound. With their third full length, American Anthems Vol. 1, the boys from Jersey focused on writing durable songs and memorable melodies while creating an accessible collection of rock gems. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Milwaukees">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
