Ben Moorhouse, Gwilym Gold and Alexis Nunez formed Golden Silvers in 2007. The London based trio have been described by Time Out magazine as "[an] infectious, oddly futuristic mix of Blockheads, of Montreal and doo wop".

Hotly tipped London newcomers Golden Silvers are set to release their debut album True Romance on April 27th (2009). The group caused a stir last year with some cracking shows and a series of wonderful singles. Containing the same synth driven beauty that drives MGMT, Golden Silvers have their own uniquely English voice.

Singles on independent labels such as "Arrows Of Eros / Fade To Black" and "Magic Touch / Another Universe" led to a bidding war, with XL Recordings winning the band's signature.

They disbanded in 2010. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Golden+Silvers">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
