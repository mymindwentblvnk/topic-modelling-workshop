Future Disorder was founded in 2003 by members that had been playing together since the mid-nineties. They released their first EP in the Summer of 2005 called "Deterioration" and followed that up with their second EP "Chemically Sedated" in 2006.  During the winter of 2006 the band began recording tracks for "Sounds of Catastrophe" which was released in the summer of 2007.  Sounds of Catastrophe was recorded in Future Disorder's personal studio and professionally mastered by three grammy winner Joe Palmaccio.  Future Disorder strives to create original metal sound that is both interesting and powerful, yet brutally honest in its attempt at aggressive harmony.   Having the goal of creating a sound collaborating all our favorite realms of metal. Taking influences from everything from black, to thrash, to death, all the way down to good ol' southern boy beer drinkin rock 'n roll, Future Disorder continues to strive to be an original, no holds barred metal act.
