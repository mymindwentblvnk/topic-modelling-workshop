Pyrotraktor is a metal band from Lausanne, Switzerland with heavy, thrash and hard rock influences. The band delivers an explosive live performance, filled with fast and powerful riffs, as well as slower and more rhythmic parts; a combination that is suited for moshers and headbangers.

The story of the band started in 2003. At the time, the line-up was a bit unstable, with different musicians coming, going and bringing different influences to the music. However, a solid line-up was quickly established and the band was able to make a name for itself in the local metal scene.

Things took off around 2007, when the band had built up a good set list and started playing more and more gigs. They even performed at a few festivals such as Baleinev or StormFest, where they shared the stage with more famous bands like Kandyss, Kruger, Monkey3 and Mumakil.

Pyrotraktor is about to release a self-produced 12-track album and is looking to perform in Switzerland and Europe <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pyrotraktor">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
