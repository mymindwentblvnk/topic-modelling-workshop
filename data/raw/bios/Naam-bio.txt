One of the newest signings to Tee Pee, Naam is a three-piece band from Brooklyn, New York, United States whose blissed-out jam-heavy pyschedella is spotlighted on the 11 minute "Kingdom". Naam's characteristic brand of psychedelic droning stonermass on the Kingdom EP and the self titled full length (2009) will surely please fans of Dead Meadow, Grails and Sleep.

Off of their MySpace:
"Beyond the conceptual language structure created by mankind, the definition of the name lies in internal rhythm, the internal sound that a man experiences. Those who embrace Naam have the key to the door of mysteries and miracles, as Naam exists in the Divine plane and shines through to the Physical plane, bringing healing and self-renewal.

Disgusted by the lack of heavy, psychedelic rock and roll, We deliver our deafening sermon to bring a new dawn for all civilization. The vast seas cannot drown Us, the darkest caverns cannot conceal Us, We will conquer insurmountable foes. We are war, We are peace, We are time and space, We are infinite, We are Naam." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Naam">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
