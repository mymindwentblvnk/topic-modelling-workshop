Genuine Relief's journey started in the half of the year 2009, when atmospheric/black metal band Dalgoreth ceased to exist, whilst Genuine were born out of its ashes. In the next 6 months there was a significant work on composing new material going on. New bass player was welcome aboard in the autumn, and since then the band became fully operative.

In the early months of 2010, bassplayer Orbb had to quit the band due to the lack of time, although was quickly replaced by Tomáš Jech  (also Secret Of Darkness,ex- Bonesaw Of The Brains).
