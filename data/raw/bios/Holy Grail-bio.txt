Holy Grail consists of White Wizzard alums James Paul Luna, James J LaRue and Tyler Meahl, along with the blazing co-shred guitar of Eli Santana and the thunderous deathblow of bassist Blake Mount.

In smoldering cauldrons of wicked brutality, Holy Grail combines elements of NWOBHM, Shred, Thrash and Doom featuring unmatched vocal domination and guitar astro-technics.

Their debut album titled crisis in utopia was released on October 22nd, 2010 via Prosthetic Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Holy+Grail">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
