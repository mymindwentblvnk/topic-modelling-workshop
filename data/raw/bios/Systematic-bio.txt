1)Systematic was a hard rock band from San Jose, California. They were discovered by Lars Ulrich, drummer for Metallica, after Ulrich heard one of the band's demos. They were promptly signed to Ulrich's label, The Music Company (Elektra), and their first album, Somewhere in Between, was released in 2001. In 2003, Systematic released their 2nd album, Pleasure to Burn, which included new members Johny Betchel on Bass and Paul Bostaph (formally of Slayer) on Drums. 

The band toured extensively, including opening slots for Godsmack, Saliva, & Stone Sour among others, as well as Ozzfest 2001, Tattoo the Earth Tour, and the Jagermeister Music Tour. 

Systematic disbanded in 2004. Tim is now in the rock band Spiralarms, which features former members of ManMadeGod and Machine Head.
