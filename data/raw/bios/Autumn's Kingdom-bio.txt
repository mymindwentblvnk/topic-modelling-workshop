Autumn's Kingdom was a raw melancholic black metal one-man project from Russian Federation. It was established in autumn 2012 by B.M. (Skyforest, Blurry Lights) and later laid to rest in the beginning of 2013. There were published two demos with improvised instrumental songs and was planned a full-length album, but the project was laid to rest after the 2nd demo. A bit later, however, it was decided to write the full-length album. It took the self-titled name "Autumn's Kingdom" and was published for only free download in August 2013. At the same day the project was closed.
Some time later the only published full-length album was also out on tapes, limited to 19 copies only, by russian label From The Dark Past. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Autumn%27s+Kingdom">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
