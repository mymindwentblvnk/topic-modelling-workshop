1. Bill Laswell in slow meditative ambient Dub mode. Personnel include Gabe Gatz from Blind Idiot God and DJ Spooky, as well as Bill Laswell alumni Nicky Skopelites, Lilli Haydn, Tetsu Inoue and Robert Musso.

2. Electro-punk outfit from the Pacific Northwest comprised of Okibi and Steeve B. They combine a number of industrial, noise, pop, and post-punk elements into a danceable and eclectic mix of politics, story-telling, and the occult.

3. Seattle threesome formerly known as the Automaton Adventure Series recall Built to Spill, the uber-influential Sister-era Sonic Youth or Fugazi with their blend of smart noise rock and cynical poly-sci lyrics. The band, consisting of Pat Kearney (guitar, vocals), James van Leuven (drums), and Chris Duryee (bass), formed in 1998 and put out their first single on Galleon Key. A full length, the Phil Ek produced futura transmitta, followed in 1999 and was co-released on Galleon Key and Satellite Transmissions, an indie-label closely associated with the underground fanzine Skyscraper. In 2000 they dropped the bulky 'Adventure Series' and became simply Automaton (which is also the name of a mid-90s Bill Laswell project, confusingly). Clarions and Banners came in 2002 on PacifiCo with Phil Ek and Steve Wold again as engineers.

4. Steampunk power metal band from Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.

5. Psychedelic Doom band from Athens, Greece. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Automaton">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
