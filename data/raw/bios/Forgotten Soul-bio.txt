Forgotten Soul, aka Richard Flood grew up & in Gillingham UK and spent most of his youth around the Kent and London area.

He’s had a passion for Jungle/Drum & Bass ever since he 1st heard it on Pirate Radio in the early nineties on stations like Sweet FM.

The tune ‘Meditation’ by DJ Crystl was the track that 1st got him hooked & it’s still his favourite tune to this day.

Forgotten Soul started going to raves in 1993 and from there went on to build his own record collection & start mixing. The 1st Jungle record he ever purchased was ‘Shot In The Dark’ by DJ Hype on Suburban Base Records.

He also has a passion for Reggae Soundclash & Dub so the DJ’s that really influenced him in the 90′s were DJs like Mickey Finn, Darren Jay & Dj Ron who played the more ragga style of Jungle.

In 1994 at the age of 17 he started playing at local clubs in & around Kent. His 1st gigs came from winning some heats in a local DJ competition which got him a residency.

Forgotten Soul spent most of the 90’s going to events like Roast, AWOL, Desire & One Nation but it wasn’t till the year 2000 he decided to get into production after meeting DJ Zen who gave him a crash course in music production.

This really inspired him to get into the studio & learn as much as he could from other producers & in 2002 he hooked up with Special K & Jay D Cruze & spent a lot of time mastering some of their professional techniques. He also spent a lot of time at Transitions Studio in Catford learning production & getting his music cut onto vinyl.

During his DJ Career so far Forgotten Soul has played for some of the biggest Drum & Bass events in the UK including Jungle Fever and Champion Sounds but the highlight of his career was when he played alongside Brockie, Ray Keith & Randall for Pure Science at club Atomics.

Whatever style of track he’s writing you’ll be sure to hear the influences of Jungle & Reggae fused deep within his crafted beats.
