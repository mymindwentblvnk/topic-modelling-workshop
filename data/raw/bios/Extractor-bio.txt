NOTE: Band name is Extractor, not eXtractor.

Extractor hails from Portland, Oregon, founded by Rob (Bass, Vocals) and Bret (Guitar, Drums). Obsessed with Thrash Metal music, they felt there was a lack of the classic sound being produced in this day and age. Deciding it be imperative to keep thrash alive, Rob and Bret formed Extractor in the summer of 2002. Inspired by Thrash kings such as Coroner, Sabbat (UK), Sodom, Kreator, Destruction, Tankard, Forbidden, Atheist, Slayer, etc... Extractor developed their own unique style. In the bowels of the Northwest forest, they continue to make ears bleed at the Extractor stronghold.  They are masters of covering songs of various likings, and perfecting their own distinct sound.

Recently, the band has been stronger than ever, and are finishing up material for the upcoming album.  The band lineup is set, thanks to the new rhythm guitarist Aaron, who joined Extractor in mid-2007. Three new songs are ready, to kick your fucking asses, titled: Bred For Battle, Get To The Chopper & WarBeast!

As any band would progress to better things, Extractor has had many opportunities that have had to be turned down, due to schiester promoters.
"Money is not our concern, insane thrash metal is."

However, the Portland Metal scene is still thriving, and has given great support in our Thrash Metal endeavors. Extractor will continue to thrash until our hands are crippled from arthritis, and our necks break from consistent headbanging.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Extractor">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
