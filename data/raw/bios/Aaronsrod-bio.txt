Aaronsrod is a heavy metal band from Hawaii that formed in the early 80's by Angelo Jensen and Brian Spalding who played together in a band called Kaos. They added the bass player Edward Dysarz and then went through numerous drummers and guitarists before finding Neil Delaforce and Gerard Gonsalves. They played lots of shows around Hawaii and opened up for bands such as Ratt and Judas Priest. They signed a three album deal with CBS / Roadrunner Records with the help of producer Rick Asher Keefer of Seawest Studios. Their debut album ``Illusions Kill`` was released in 1986 and received critical acclaim in Japan (#5), Germany (#5) and Italy (#2). They were also on the charts in other countries as well as being featured in many heavy music magazines such as Burrn!, Metal Aarschok and Kerrang!. Their follow-up albums Hardball and a live album were recorded but never released since the band moved to Los Angeles and were no longer in contact with Keefer. After the move the band parted ways with Edward and Gerard and recruited new members. Neil also soon left but Angelo and Brian continued to play all major clubs in the Los Angeles area. The band had dissolved soon afterwards but recently reformed and released a new single. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Aaronsrod">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
