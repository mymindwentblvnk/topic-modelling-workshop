The Andrew Oldham Orchestra is a side project fronted by Andrew Loog Oldham, from London, United Kingdom, the original manager of the Rolling Stones. 

The Orchestra released four studio albums, 'East Meets West: Famous Hits of the Beach Boys and the Four Seasons' (1964), '16 Hip Hits' (1964), 'Lionel Bart's Maggie May' (1964), and 'Rolling Stones Songbook' (1966). 

Rolling Stones Songbook features the orchestrated version of the Mick Jagger and Keith Richards song 'The Last Time', which was sampled by The Verve for their track 'Bitter Sweet Symphony'. Licensing issues over the sample caused the copyright of the song to revert to ABKCO Records and the composition to Jagger and Richards. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Andrew+Oldham+Orchestra">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
