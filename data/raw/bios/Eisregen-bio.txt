Eisregen is a German, lyrically extreme, dark metal band which was founded in 1994. The members are from Tambach-Dietharz, a village in Thüringen (Thuringia). By using morbid German lyrics unlike those of other bands of this genre, they got the attention of German authorities, causing the banning of three of their albums, one EP and one live-video. The reason given was the lyrics, described as "grausam, menschenverachtend, frauenfeindlich, verrohend und sozial-ethisch desorientierend" (cruel, inhuman, misogynistic, brutalising and socially/ethically desorienting).

Michael Roth (vocals) and Michael Lenz (guitar) have a sideproject "Eisblut". Michael Lenz is also a Member of "Amenthes". Yantit and 2T also have a sideproject called "Transilvanian Beat Club". Yanit has another sideproject called "Ewigheim" with Theresa Trenks and Michael Roth as guests.
