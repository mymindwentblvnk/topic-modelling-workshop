AlphaState is a three-piece fronted by Ani on vocals, with Elliot on bass and Jonathan on guitar that "inhabits the vast swirling soundscapes that have writers reaching for descriptive cliches such as 'sonic cathedrals'" (ArtRocker webzine).

AlphaState's dark yet sparkling and haunting melodies go straight for the hairs on the back of your neck.  The widescreen atmospherics and staccato drum programming hints at The xx, Joy Division and 'Disintegration'-era The Cure, but somehow AlphaState are more expansive, less claustrophobic.

The alchemic mix of bass and guitar effects and edgy, lurking atmospherics are punched along by AlphaState's wickedly programmed drum machine and layered with Ani's voice which, although tinged with a sadness, soars beautifully with the music.  The dark and driven songs talk of fractured relationships and an unhappy disquiet with the world, but there's no tragic resignation here; instead a sense of urgency and determination. 

Fronted by singer Ani Kempton, with Elliot Dwight on bass and Jonathan Akerman on guitar - and the Alesis SR16 cranking out the galloping, staccato beats.
