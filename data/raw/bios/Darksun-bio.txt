The group DarkSun was formed in 2002 after the demerger of the group Nörthwind formation with which even sold more than 12,000 copies of his two EP's.

The bet was very strong: the first disc DarkSun was a recording Luxury studies VPS of Germany along with Ingo Cjavkoski (Rage), and was mixed at House of Music Studios with Aichm Köhler (Primal Fear, Sinner). In addition collaborated international stars of the stature of Kiko Loureiro (Angra), listening to this disc did not hesitate to participate. The criticisms were not pray and left "The Legacy" as one of the best discs of the year and national Darksun as one of the great revelations. The tour presentation was no less: concerts all over the peninsula and excellent reviews.

The continuation of "The Legacy" was not long in coming and was recorded during the summer of 2005 again by Ingo Cjavkoski in Germany, but also with the help of Lars Ratz (Metalium), Dennis Ward (Angra, PC 69) and the collaboration luxury Peavy Wagner (Rage) singing on the theme "Prisoners of Fate" which became a video clip. Again criticism surrendered to Darksun calling this album, "The Dark Side" as a masterpiece of the metal.

"El lado oscuro" has been recorded in English called "The Dark Side," to be published in September 2007 by FC Metal Recordings. Darksun has worked with Rage in his latest album "Speak of the Death" for release bonus track of the theme "Fullmoon" adapting the letter into Spanish.

After closing the tour "The Dark Side Tour" with more than 25 dates throughout Spain and sharing the stage with bands like Motorhead, DarkSun been in the studio finishing preparing its third studio record.
