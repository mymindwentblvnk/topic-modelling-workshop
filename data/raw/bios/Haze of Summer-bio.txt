The history of Haze of Summer starts in 2016 in Podolsk, Russia. Initially planning a one man band project, Nikita Druzhinin, finding a like-minded person in the person of Alexander Klaptsov (Grace Disgrace, Bestial Invasion) and began work on material that could go beyond the standard Black Metal. During the recording of the debut album, Andrey Ishchenko (Arkona), Belf (Izmoroz), Ilya Rizaev (Logic Event), Rodion Lubensky, Gosha Yankovsky and Alexander Vorobiev (all from Voice of Omeriki) joined the band as session musicians.
Haze of Summer does not position itself as the canonical Black Metal project. The main goal is to get rid of the labels and stamps of a rather conservative genre, both in music and in performance. To convey in the lyrics those thoughts and experiences that are simple and understandable for any person.
Having huge experience of participation in collectives of different directions, musicians transferred this experience to a new group. This resulted in a variety of arrangements by Alexander Klaptsov using non-standard combinations of instruments. The group as a whole was influenced by such projects as Deafheaven, Nocte Obducta and Gray Waters. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Haze+Of+Summer">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
