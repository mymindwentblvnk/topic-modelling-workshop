Along with her next hit "Sk8er Boi" - she emphasized a skate punk persona and earned her the title "Pop Punk Queen" from music publications.

Her followup album "Under My Skin" sold 10 million copies worldwide and went to #1 on the Billboard 200 in the US. Lavigne's third album "The Best Damn Thing" features the single "Girlfriend", which reached #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in May 2007.

Lavigne's third studio album, The Best Damn Thing (2007), reached number one in seven countries worldwide and saw the international success of its lead single "Girlfriend", which became her first single to reach the top of the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States. Her fourth and fifth studio albums, Goodbye Lullaby (2011) and Avril Lavigne (2013), saw continued commercial success and were both certified gold in Canada, the United States, and other territories.

Musical Style:

During the 2000s decade, most critics and publications identified Lavigne's first three albums as a mix of pop punk, alternative rock and pop rock, influenced by a post-grunge sound. Later on in the 2010s, her sound went softer and poppier, characterized more by acoustic pop-rock songs and less loud grungy guitar-driven songs that were the signature of her earlier works. Lavigne stated that the new upcoming album will be a return for her pop punk roots (Love Sux). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Avril+Lavigne">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
