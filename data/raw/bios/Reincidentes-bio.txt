The germ of Reincidentes was in its first punk band "Incidente Local", which had a brief stint in the scene of his city (Sevilla) between 1985 and 1986. Later, members were actively involved in the student protests of 1987, giving a concert at the University of Sevilla, then occupied by students. After this, Reincidentes took a big step towards consolidation in the Juanjo Pizarro recording studio. The model that emerged from the study helped them to participate in a contest sponsored by the Rock Council of Seville in 1989, where they were finalists. Since then, Reincidentes has grown and developed his personality, becoming one of the most urban rock bands cutting social in Spain and South America countries. Its lyrics are almost the most important element in the band, so they have fans only in the Spanish-speaking countries, in the other countries Reincidentes are almost totally unknown. its 3 first albums (this is the second) its music had a little touches of punk, but after the band turn 180º and became in a complet rock´n´roll band.
