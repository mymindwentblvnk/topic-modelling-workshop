Melodic / Symphonic Death Metal from Montreal(Canada). After a few years, the band's line-up was complete. The tracking for our EP (Our Blessing) occured during the summer of 2013. Six months later, it was released and the journey truly began. The most recent track released by the band is "The Price Of Innocence" which is one of the tracks of their upcoming and first LP. Recently the band has seen the arrival of a new member on bass guitar (Maxime Legault). The band now grows even stronger and are more than ready to bring out new material!
