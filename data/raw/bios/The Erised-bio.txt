A unique collective from Ukraine, The Erised includes drum & bass producers Detail and Hidden Element, instrumentalists derived from jazz, rock and pop backgrounds and dancer turned singer/songwriter Sonya, together making an unstoppable combination. The band’s impressive debut release, the “Desire” EP, included the supremely popular “Pray” and “It’s Over“, which helped establish a core following amongst music fans across Europe and beyond.

Playing live with a full five-piece band, The Erised’s performances are haunting and hypnotic, a perfect compliment to Med School’s eclectic selection of DJs. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Erised">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
