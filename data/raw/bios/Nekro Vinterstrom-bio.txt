Nekro Vinterstrom, formed in 2003, is a one-man black metal band from Westfield, New Jersey.
"Born in the Apocalyptic Battlefield of the New Jersey Suburbs, Nekro Vinterstrom released it's raw fury of Trve New Jerseyan Black Metal, shocking the world with it's Blasphemous Necromantics. Count Termin√ïtor, the trve genius behind the band, plays all the earpiercing vocals of the dead, shredded strings, grim keyboards, and frostbiting drums. The band was later moved to England, but still retains it's pride for the hard streets of New Jersey." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nekro+Vinterstrom">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
