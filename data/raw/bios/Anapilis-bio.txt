One of the most interesting dark music bands from the second biggest city of Lithuania - Kaunas. Anapilis' lunatics manage to combine many genres in their music. During almost seven years of existence they have changed their style from folky metal to emotional darkwave, which the members of the band prefer to call lunar punk. Whatever this term could mean, the performances of Anapilis are rich in macabric elegance, theatrical feeling and strongly extravagant imaginery.

By the end of 2004, three members had left this group. Officially, only the leader is working with it.
