Philadelphia Pennsylvania   (2011 - Present)



"Givethemrope are a groove metal band with undertones of sludge, death metal, and hardcore. Based out of a suburb of Philadelphia, they released their self-titled debut album in June of 2012. The band possesses a great deal of potential and have already made a name for themselves through their intense and nearly unbeatable live performance; They've been compared to Lamb of God not in sound but in raw stage energy."
- Sociopathic Sound 


"A heavy, crushing band out of Coatesville, PA, fueled by drummer Chris Hamilton from the band BloodSimple. Also features, Rich Books: Vocals – Rian Poltrone: Guitar – Ahmed Smith: Bass – Jason Silvester: Guitar. With a sound built from pure brutality, these fellas shook the walls here at MOG recording their self-titled debut." 
- Joey Z / Life of Agony/ Method of Groove studio 


"Givethemrope, to put it simply, is an intense band. Not just metal concert intense, but also “Get out of my way or I’ll kick you in the throat” intense. Vocalist Rich Books had, at times, a frightening stage presence. He wasn’t rocking corpse paint, tearing bibles, or spitting blood, he was simply yelling into the souls of every spectator before him all the while cracking beers in between songs. Givethemrope reminded me a lot of metal giants Lamb of God, not necessarily in musical prowess but more so in the band’s collective behavior up on stage. They weren’t posturing or posing, they played their harsh groove-metal set with every ounce of energy they could muster with an in-your-face hardcore edge."
