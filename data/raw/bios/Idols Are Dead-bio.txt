Idols Are Dead were formed by Mana (Vocals) and Luka (Drums), who both used to play together for several years in two successful bands like Electrocution, first, and Folder, later. Electrocution was one of the most important Italian death/thrash bands of the 90’s and Folder one of the coolest and most important nu-metal/crossover acts as well! They formed IAD to pay tribute to their huge and endless love for dirty heavy metal in the vein of Metallica, Slayer, Anthrax and more! To do this they’ve recluted two smashing guitarists coming from their hometown Bologna as well, Alley-X and Ico. All these forces are now melted in this brand new band that is absolutely NOT to be considered as a simple side-project! No mistakes please! Last addition has been Maxx C. on bass, who used to play with Mana and Luka in both Folder and Electrocution. The production of the band’s debut album, ‘Mean’, expected on Scarlet Records in February 2008, took place at Fear Studio with Italian producer Gabriele Ravaglia, and it’s already described as the perfect mix of their thrash influences with a modern edge that can bring to mind bands such as Trivium, Bullet For My Valentine, Atreyu and Avenged Sevenfold. This is not “another teenage band” but a strong act definetely worth to check! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Idols+Are+Dead">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
