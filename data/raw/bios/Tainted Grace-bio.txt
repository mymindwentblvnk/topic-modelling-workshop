Since 2007, Tainted Grace have been playing to crowds at venues across the south of England. Most recently, the band finished recording its debut EP, Denial Daydreams. With this stylishly presented and quality-sounding 5-track release, the band hope to expose their own brand of female-fronted melodic metal to a wider audience.

Listeners to Denial Daydreams will find a record brimming with head-banging metal riffs harmonised on twin guitars and overlaid by a mixture of haunting vocals and catchy melodies – all backed up by an explosive rhythm section.

The EP will be on-sale at Tainted Grace’s forthcoming gigs as the band looks to re-establish itself on the live metal scene after recent line-up changes saw the departure of Andrew Fuentes and Andy Simpson and the arrival of Stuart Turner and Rich Ward. Previous gigs had seen Tainted Grace sharing the stage with bands such as Senser and Season’s End and the fresh TG line-up will be hitting venues such as Reading’s Facebar and London’s Bridgehouse 2 with the likes of Pythia before 2010 is out.

Having opened the Dames of Darkness festival in 2008, the revitalised Tainted Grace crew are hoping that their professionalism and cohesion as a band will take them onto bigger stages, such as Bloodstock, in the future.

More immediate developments include a music video in the pipeline and a new set of promo pictures so that everyone can see what Tainted Grace in 2011 are all about!
