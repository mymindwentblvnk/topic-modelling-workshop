Butterflies is the songwriting project of singer/guitarist Josh Kimbrough. Josh has been writing songs since he was fifteen and has established his prolific musical life by fronting such bands as Mortar and Pestle, Westfalia, and Straight No Chaser as well as contributing significantly to Trekky Records' house band, Auxiliary House. With Butterflies, Josh has retained many of the elements of his previous projects, while increasing the care given to the craft of pop songwriting. While Kimbroughâ€™s signature fluttering guitar lines and vocals are still the bedrock of his compositions, his newfound focus on mature and concise pop songs has lead him to create more fully-realized musical statements than ever before.

Butterflies will release a series of EPs available at live shows before preparing for a Trekky full length. Josh has employed a cast of Trekky regulars to help him from time to time. These musicians include Martin Anderson, Bobby Britt, Ross Connolly, Travis Diehl, Joe Norkus and Katie Zickefoose. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Butterflies">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
