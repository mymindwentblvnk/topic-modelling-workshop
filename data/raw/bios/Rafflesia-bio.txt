Rafflesia, named after gighandi´s ´ 93 masterpiece release, was formed in the spring of 2005 at a coastal village, Zeebrugge, Belgium. A furious combination of hardcore and metalcore, melody and mosh, thrash and metal.

A solid formation was created by finally finding the right people to enforce the machine "Rafflesia". 5 friends combining their passion for metal.
