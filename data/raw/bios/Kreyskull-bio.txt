Kreyskull is ”heavy rock`n doom” band from the south-east parts of Finland. That blends their riff-heavy doom grooviness with influences from the classic era 70´s heavy metal and prog rock. And even flirting with occasional jazz and psychedelia. With strong vocal performance, screaming lead guitars and bombastic rhythm section, they create their own unique style of Heavy Rock. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kreyskull">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
