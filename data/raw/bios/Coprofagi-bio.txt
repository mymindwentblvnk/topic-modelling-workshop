So far not much to tell. Two alcoholic bastards Jussi Vuorio ja Niko Haaranen decided in sommer 2007 to found a band in veins of Autopsy, Nihilist, Mortem and many more harsh old-school "Death metal"-bands. Unfortunately having rehearsals together was not often possible because the guitarist Jussi was studying in Germany, and niko was in Finland. In winter 2007 Coprofagi had a good chance to train and record the new songs together. With a big help of Miika from Scythian we got our first demo out in february 2008. Now Coprofagi is working the next demo with Miika, who took the basist place in the band. Up next it was time for guitarist Rony Lang to enter the death metal crew.

Inspired by GG Allin, Scatology and Mexican profanity, Finland's Coprofagi are also responsible for Espoo's notorious "Jupperi Cult" - an international redneck collective of vagrants, 'party-raptors' and body-building scum. Their music is loosely influenced by the sordid works of Autopsy.
