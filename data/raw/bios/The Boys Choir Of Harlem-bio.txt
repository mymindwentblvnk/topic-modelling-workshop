The Boys Choir of Harlem (also known as the Harlem Boys Choir) is a choir located in Harlem, New York City, USA. Founded in 1968 by Dr. Walter Turnbull. The choir is internationally known. Performers receive rigorous voice training and perform many types of music, including classical, hip-hop, r&b, jazz, and gospel music. Over 150,000 people see the choir live each year across the United States as well as in Canada, France, Japan, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. The BCH were also the recipients of a Grammy. Like its more famous Austrian cousin, the Vienna Boys Choir, the Boys Choir of Harlem adheres strictly to a policy of including those young men who have not reached puberty. The range of the music performed is such that it requires natural boy sopranos whose voices have not yet changed.

The choir has performed on soundtracks for films including Glory , Malcolm Xand many Spike Lee films and has performed for Presidents at the White House, and dignitaries at the United Nations. It also performed live for the visits of Nelson Mandela and Pope John Paul II. It performed on Chicago rapper Kanye West's song, Two Words, and Jesus Walks. The choir also performed America the Beautiful to open Wrestlemania XX. Their glorious voices have also appeared on albums with Kathleen Battle, Luciano Pavarotti, Quincy Jones and many more. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Boys+Choir+of+Harlem">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
