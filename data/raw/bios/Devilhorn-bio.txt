Devilhorn was born as Ryöti's soloproject in 2001. The first three demos was composed and recorded by Ryöti himself. These demos were:
2002: Deflagro Aether
2002: Through The Burning Paradise
2005: Vengeance


In 2006 the idea to do gigs turned Devilhorn into a band. The first release as a band, Psychotic-EP was released March 2007.
