Started as a one-man project of Impenitence bassist Dimitar Vasilev (Impenitence, ITSI). The idea behind the project initially was to house discarded ideas from his other band Impenitence, which later morphed into a different kind of aggressive death metal. In 2014 Boyan "Kveld Ulf' Gerdjikov (Impenitence, Occultum, ex-Nephelium) joins the project as primary lyricist and vocalist.

The name of the band comes from Frank Herbert's Dune novels.
