Houston-born, Oakland-based Greg Ashley is the vocalist & guitarist of the psychedelic band The Gris Gris. Ashley also performs as a solo artist, concentrating on the delicately trippy psych-folk that occasionally makes its way into his band's louder, more unpredictable music.

Late in 2003, Birdman Records released his debut album, Medicine Fuck Dream, which drew comparisons to Mayo Thompson and fellow-Texan Roky Erickson. Ashley's second solo album, Painted Garden, arrived early in 2007, and though it had considerably cleaner production than his debut, it shared the same free-flowing songwriting and surreal lyrics.

Ashley is also a producer, and has worked with The Mirrors, Battleship, Brian Glaze, and The Strange Boys. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Greg+Ashley">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
