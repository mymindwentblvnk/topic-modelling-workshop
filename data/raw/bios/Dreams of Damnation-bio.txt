Dangerously old-school yet unabashedly relevant to today's scene, DREAMS OF DAMNATION is a meticulous articulation of collective anger which NEVER seeks reconciliation. To witness D.O.D in a live setting is to guiltlessly indulge yourself in the timeless, multi-faceted art of revenge. Demonstrating no intentions of straying from their chosen path of destruction, Jim Durkin's guitar riffs maintain a legacy of defying transcription; Rick Alsup's precise rhythm guitar work is rivaled only by his infectious showmanship; the bass lines provided by Matthew "Roxx" Arner bears witness to what talent can achieve on just four strings; the pummelling drive & double-bass work of Matt "The Devastator" Hulderman will be sure to register on the California Richter Scale; and Loana dP Valencia's feral anti-stereotype female vocals bring an unanticipated twist to the predominantly male metal scene.

DREAMS OF DAMNATION genuinely uphold the tradition of the advances in thrash metal. From the headquarters of urban decay in Los Angeles, they've charted a trajectory aimed at becoming a band North America will be insistently proud to call their own. Welcome to the War Party.
