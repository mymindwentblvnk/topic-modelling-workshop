Pisa, Italy (2009 - Present)

GOTTESMORDER is a 3 pieces Italian atmospheric black metal band born in late 2009 and consisting of Nicola (ex-Violentbreakfast, Chambers), Michele (ex-île, Magdalene) and Matteo (ex-Seicentodiciotto). They have just release their self-titled EP via Absurd Creature Records / Tokyo Jupiter Records / Nojoy Records and it can be heard on their bandcamp page.

From Absurd Creature Records:

"Guitars like drones, primitive drums, bestial throat. The Gottesmorder Ep aim to be the dark age sound in which contemporary human being will find frosty/obsessive atmospheres as well. The two tracks record is almost a concept, talkin’ about the deafness of nature. It boasts the collaborations of K11/Pietro Riparbelli and Lee Baughn (Ghost Empire). If you like bands like WOLVES IN THE THRONE ROOM, ALTAR OF PLAGUES and FALL OF EFRAFA, don’t miss them!

It has been recorded at Orange Recordings Studio with Stefano ”Zven” Doretti, mixed and mastered at Locomotore Studio with Lorenzo Stecconi (Ufomammut, Lento, ZU, Dälek). The artwork has been done by the graphic/musician Mories (Gnaw Their Tougues, Aderlating, De Magia Veterum). "
