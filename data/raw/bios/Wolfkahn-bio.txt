The origin of Wolfkahn can be traced back to early 2004 when guitarists Spiro Hatziandreou and Pierre Duyker met by chance in the chaotic Metallica moshpit at the Sydney Big Day Out.

After various short-lived musical projects, the time was right to start fresh and create a new project that would raise the bar on anything theyâ€™d done previously. They recruited drummer Luke Martignago and vocalist Chris Elder in mid 2008. Following the release of their debut EP in mid 2010, Wolfkahn parted ways with Elder and recruited Damien Ziomek, frontman of south Sydney metal act Fortress, and newcomer Leighton Wright to fill the long-vacant position of bass guitarist.

Wolfkahn is a metal band that deals in concepts. The extreme sound is complemented with high emphasis on dark melodies and groove-orientated passages. From blackened death metal to neo-classical and everything in between, the band chooses to explore all possibilities that exist in heavy music.
