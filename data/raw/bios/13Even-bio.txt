13even (1999 - 2006), was a raucous band from Delaware County, Pennsylvania, USA. They juxtaposed (often contradictory) elements of Progressive Metal, and Rock with elements of Thrash Metal with varying degrees of success.

Cutting their teeth in haunts like Friendly's Tavern (Delco), The Pontiac Grille(Philadelphia), Tom and Jerry's (Delco) and The Trocadero (Philadelphia), they made a lot of friends and enemies in their time, but always seemed to manage having fun doing both. 13even opened for ands like Marilyn Manson, Trivium, Unearth, Lamb Of God, God Forbid, Machinehead, 3 Inches of Blood, Mortal Decay, Chimaira, Atreyu, Otep, Slayer,Kings X,Ill Nino, Gary Neuman and many more ~13EVEN opened the stage of Ozzfest 2004 13EVEN has two independent releases.(Handshakes and Casualties-2005)
