Munich’s extreme metal band Saeculum Obscurum [lat.: The Dark Age] was founded by Marcelo Fernandes (guitar), Bennet Berger (guitar), Ulrich Retzow (drums) and Christian Schmid (bass) at the end of 2007. The line up was completed by Thorsten Schröder (vocals) in 2008. Christian Schmid left the band in 2009 and was replaced by Emanuel Pfitzner (bass). At the beginning the band focused on melodic death metal and released the self-produced EP “From the Shadows” in 2009. After the EP the band decided to detach itself from melodic death metal in order to create a cross-genre sound by combining elements of melodic death, black and thrash metal. In January 2011 their debut album called "Into the Depths of Oblivion" will be released by Thunderblast Records. Fully loaded with 10 epic extreme metal songs, the album convinces with a broad spectrum from brute blast beat attacks and pounding metal grooves to sentimental clean passages, chorales and neoclassical piano parts. Lyrically Saeculum Obscurum deals with the acherontic abysses in the history of mankind, both from a personal and a historic point of view. The band concentrates on creating this dark, sinister atmosphere as well as on technical details, particularly in the accurate guitar arrangements and the solo duels of the two guitar players. With challenging riffs and harmonic fretless bass parts over acoustic passages the bass both supports and extends the music just as the drummer with his sense for groove, feeling and underlining guitar accents. The vocals add a range from grim and dark growls to high and fragile screams to express this portentous journey into abyss.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Saeculum+Obscurum">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
