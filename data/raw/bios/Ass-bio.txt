There are two artists named Ass: 

1) After half a decade of living room recordings whilst backing up the Swedish top list artists, versatile punk rocker and instrumentalist Andreas Söderström from Stockholm, Sweden has made his debut as a solo artist under the name Ass.

It's a mainly instrumental folktronic journey into a soundscape of multilayers performed entirely by himself. Selftutored amongst the jungle of strings in his father's bouzoki factory, Andreas is a familiar bearded face in the Swedish alternative music scene.

Over the past years Andreas has played bass with multi-awarded pop princess Jenny Wilson, trumpet and lapsteel with the international renowned electronica project Tape, harmonium, key harp and guitar with the folk orchestras Barr, Pallin, Blood Music and Taken By Trees, the latest incarnation of former Concretes singer Victoria Bergsman.

2) Ass is also a DIY punk band in Minneapolis, whose message screams we’re proud to be different, proud to Queer and be proud of being non-conformist. Musically they play raw punk rock that would have fit in well with early 90’s East Bay bands such as BLATZ and FILTH, playing rousing scream-along anthems. ASS have been active in the Minneapolis punk scene for the past several years and active in the local homocore movement. Aside from venturing out to suburban venues where other Minneapolis bands rarely go, they have also self-released their first 12”/ CD, and host one of the largest DIY punk message boards in the Twin Cities on their web site

3) This dude from  Strasbourg
