GRIP is been called “Atlanta’s Next Great Storyteller” and is quickly generating buzz and acclaim. He dropped his breakout project “Porch” in 2017, followed by “Snubhouse” in 2019. Then he dropped two more new projects called “Halo” and “Proboscidea“. GRIP’s lyrical music and building popularity caught the ear of Paul Rosenberg, who then introduced him to Eminem.

“Grip is the type of artist that brings you into his world and expresses himself through a complete composed body of work. If true album artists in this era are a rare breed- then Grip is a unicorn! We’re excited for him to join the Shady Records family,” says Paul Rosenberg.

“It was one of those full-circle moments because I grew up on Eminem so to have him reach out and let me know how dope my shit is was so cool. Excited to partner with Shady/Interscope and get the music out on a larger platform,” says GRIP.

Grip debuted back in 2017 with his album PORCH which received acclaim from the local Atlanta community. He later returned with his sophomore project Snubnose and put out a couple of EPs in 2020, Halo and PROBOSCIDEA. Back in February, he teased fans with the release of 2 albums in 2021.

Eminem and Shady Records took to social media to announce their newest signee, East Atlanta’s GRIP. GRIP also shared a picture of himself with Eminem in the studio. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Grip">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
