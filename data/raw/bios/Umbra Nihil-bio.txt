Umbra Nihil is an obscure doomish metal act, originally from Northern Finland. Since 2000 the band has evolved into the being that produced the latest full length offering titled The Borderland Rituals (2008). The Borderland Rituals, Umbra Nihil’s second full length release, seems like a musical mongrel mostly drawing influences from slow doom flavoured metal, 70’s prog rock, Zeuhl, and maggot-infested Heavy Metal in general. In order to achieve a suitable claustrophobic sound and eerie, forbidding atmosphere the album was recorded in the inbred borderland, sullenly crafting the band's sound into a more organic and gelatinous direction.

In epileptic fits of pathetic rage the album betimes raises a trembling and arthritic pale fist at the uncaring cosmos-at-large and its malevolent nightside entities, which haunt hapless Mankind with unfathomable purpose - or lack thereof. Mostly, however, the aural ambience resolves in resigned rudderless levitation towards inevitable mental and physical disintegration.
