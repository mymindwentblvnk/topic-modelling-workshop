.. Residing in Leerdam (The Netherlands) - 

BURNING DARKNESS - started out around 2003. Back then, it was only Pieter (guitars) and Renzo (drums). Just two friends, jamming away in the style they liked and always wanted to play, combining heavy, thrashy riffs and ditto drumbeats.

Then guitarist Leon Vonville entered the scene as second guitarist. He introduced Constantijn de Jonge as bass player. After Leon quit the band Constantijn also started to do the vocals.

February 2007 finally saw the birth of their debut CD 'The Cantarian Curse', a concept story about a man whose worse nightmare becomes reality. Because all of the band members were quite unexperienced with recording it took a lot of time to record 'The Cantarian Curse'. This however gave them a lot of time to write material for the next cd, so in august they 'returned' to the studio to record their next CD '7 Holy Crosses'. The tracks 'Blessed by Blood' and 'Torture Tactics' were greatly appriciated by the fans.

After 5 years the band released a mini cd called '5 Years Of'.

In 2008 a second guitarist was added to the line-up. Tom Siben (SG, Gut Damn).
Since then the band has worked on a new full-length album called "The Devil In The Orchard". 
Late 2011 saw the arrival of a new cd "The Orchard". 

Due to financial reasons Tom had to leave the band in 2012, he is focusing on his other projects at the moment.
