2002-present            

Say Hi To Your Mom (presently Say Hi) is a Seattle-based, indie-pop/lo-fi rock group. Formed by Eric Elbogen in Brooklyn  2002, Say Hi's albums are mostly recorded at Elbogen's home, with him playing a majority of the instruments and providing vocals.

On tour, friends accompany Elbogen as his backing band.

Their fourth release, Impeccable Blahs, was written almost entirely about vampires, though Star Trek is also mentioned. The song "Angels and Darlas" is a reference to Angel and Darla from the television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer and its spinoff Angel both created by Joss Whedon.

With the release of their fifth album The Wishes and the Glitch, the band shortened their name to "Say Hi".This was done because the earlier name reflected an aesthetic that no longer matched the band's tastes.

Elbogen's lyrics are noted as being one of the band's strengths. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Say+Hi+To+Your+Mom">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
