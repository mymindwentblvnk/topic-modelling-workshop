"Darcy James Argue's big band skillfully realizes the leader's mature, emotive compositions and thick arrangements." — Hank Shteamer, Time Out NY

“Darcy James Argue has developed an experimental yet accessible voice as a composer… his gifts are outstanding.” — Bob Brookmeyer

A rising composer on the New York jazz scene, Darcy James Argue directs Secret Society, a dynamic 18-piece band featuring his original works. The group includes fiery players like trumpeter Ingrid Jensen, saxophonist Erica vonKleist, pianist Mike Holober, and drummer Jon Wikan. Secret Society is a forward-looking ensemble, influenced by contemporary big bands like the Maria Schneider Orchestra and the John Hollenbeck Large Ensemble, but also atmospheric indie rock bands like Tortoise and Calexico, and adventurous new music groups like Anti-Social Music and Alarm Will Sound. Secret Society made their New York debut at the CBGB Lounge on May 29, 2005. They perform regularly around New York at venues like the Bowery Poetry Club, Union Hall, and Flux Factory.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Darcy+James+Argue%27s+Secret+Society">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
