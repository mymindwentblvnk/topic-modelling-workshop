Vicente Valdés Valdés (Havana, Cuba, 10 January 1921 - New York, USA, 26 June 1995) was a popular Bolero, Guaracha singer from Cuba.

He was the younger brother of singer Alfredito Valdés, and beside him, a member of the septet of Ignacio Piñeiro, and later a member of the Orquesta Cosmopolita led by Antonio María Romeu in the 1940s.

He also worked with La Sonora Matancera, playing mainly guarachas and guaguancó such as "Yo no soy guapo", guaracha by Martínez Reineiro  and the mambo bolero styled "Decídete mi amor". One of his most signature themes was his version of "Los aretes de la luna", original by José Dolores Quiñones, an song that helped make him known to the grand public. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Vicentico+Vald%C3%A9s">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
