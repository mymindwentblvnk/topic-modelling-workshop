The Jelly Jam consists of guitarist and singer Ty Tabor (King's X), bass player John Myung (Dream Theater) and drummer Rod Morgenstein (Dixie Dregs, Winger). This project was a follow-up to Platypus, in which the trio played before with Derek Sherinian (former keyboardist for Dream Theater) on keyboards. 

The Jelly Jam is guitar-driven, psychedelically influenced rock with the spirit of Jimi Hendrix jumping in. It is quite simply a progressive rock n' roll project. The sound is very spacey and open, with a mixture of harder hitting passages to toss up the moods of the songs.

The Jelly Jam have released four albums so far: self-titled The Jelly Jam in 2002 and 2 in 2004, both under InsideOut Music. Their third album, Shall We Descend, was released in November of 2011. Finally in 2016, Profit came along. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Jelly+Jam">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
