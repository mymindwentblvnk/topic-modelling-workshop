1) Formed around 2014 in Bandung City, Previously known as Mondegreen, originally consisted of only 4 members: Kaulika (vocals), Azar (drums), Nazal (bass), and Farizan (guitar). They carried rock music as their main essence. Combined with many different forms of influences, ranged from psychedelic, alternative to new age musics, from radiohead to warpaint and foals. In the middle of 2015, Mondegreen recruited Defta as a new second guitarist.

The band combines haunting yet tender vocal lines from Kaulika. Covered in groovy and swinging bass and drum patterns from Nazal and Azar, with a gentle touch of aggressiveness. Distorted and bluesy-feel guitar playing from Farizan as a response to the rhythmic yet melodious playing from Defta's guitar and synth.

After a terrible loss at 2019, Mondegreen changed their name to Mond (stylized as MoND) as a shortened version of "MONDegreen". A new sign of reborn and renewal of their identity after Azar was deceased in August 2019. The name itself also depicts that an important part of the band may have disappeared, but that part will never leave them to carry on towards new journeys ahead with a new formation.

Every member of the band had different playing styles, preferences and influences, it made MoND’s music much more colorful yet quite distinguishable from others.
