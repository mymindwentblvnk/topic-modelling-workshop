Death Metal band from Meeuwen, Limburg, Blegium.

Resuscitation has been dwelling in the deepest depths of the underground since 1997. After the demo release of 'Injection of insanity' in 2001, which was sold & traded for 500 copies, Resuscitation closed its tombstone in order to reach the next level of deterioration. After almost 9 years of rotting and demons feasting upon the flesh & soul, the next step towards death has been reached and the unbearable silence at its grave ends. Now Resuscitation opens again its tombstone releasing the stench of unheavenly death metal upon you!
