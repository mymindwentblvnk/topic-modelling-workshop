Stardeath and White Dwarfs was born in late 2004 in Oklahoma City, and released its debut EP in the spring of 2005. Members Dennis Coyne (nephew of The Flaming Lips' Wayne Coyne), Casey Joseph, Matt Duckworth, and Philip Rice create their own brand of genre-bending sound that might occur if King Crimson and Coldplay got stoned and had sex with each other. In 2009, they released their first full length record The Birth with Trent Bell of Chainsaw Kittens fame. They collaborated with The Flaming Lips and others in 2009's remake of Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon.
