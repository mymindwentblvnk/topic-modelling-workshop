This story began on 13.12.2007, with gathering of Klemen Govekar (guitars), Kristjan Pajestka (bass) and Borna Kavčič (guitars). There was no name chosen yet, nor was there a singer or drummer. Mostly they played Metallica covers. In January 2008 Miha Petrovič took over drums. Until June that year, there was no progress, therefore the band temporarily split up.

In Autumn of 2008 the new era of the band began. In September the drummer quit. Within a month, band got a call from Filip Košnik, who said he can sing and also knows Pavel Čebašek, who's a drummer. Both soon joined the band and all together they named themselves Mephistopheles. They played their first gig and everything seemed to work perfectly. In December 2008 it showed up slightly different. The band fired Borna Kavčič for the sake of the bands progress. With a new year, a new name also came, Armaroth. In February Martin Jagodic replaced Borna on guitars, but in a meantime, Kristjan left the band. They were one man short quite a short time, beacause Igor Potočnik was taken in pretty soon. Later, there were some problems about him, but everything works well now. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Armaroth">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
