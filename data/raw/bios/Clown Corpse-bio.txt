CLOWN CORPSE are based in Hull and were formed out of the Remnants of the band Planet Ten in autumn 2006. After 11 years of Gigs around Hull and the UK, Planet Ten ground to a holt. We all still loved to have fun on stage and we always want people to enjoy watching us, consequently CLOWN CORPSE was conceived. After a few line-up changes we have now got back to what we like best. Playing live. With the added bonus of the new material starting to filter through, we have now released the long awaited CD 'Enter the Circus of Fear’. This was launched on the 1st May at the metievil festival and is now for sale, or can be now downloaded on most, (not all, yet!!) major digital internet platforms, courtesy of Diamond life Records. As well as the EP we have other merchandise for sale. Clown Corpse are signed to Diamond Life Entertainment and Extreme Promotions, whom have been in touch to offer great managing deals to help move the band forward in the metal scene. And so Clown Corpse agreed with great expectation and faith in the well established ‘Extreme Promotions’ to work together. Clown Corpse are now in the middle of developing their own personal website, and will give full details once the site has been launched. In the mean time here's a little teaser from our studio. The text will disappear when Bones starts his singing. ENJOY!!! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Clown+Corpse">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
