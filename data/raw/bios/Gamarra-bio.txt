Gamarra formed by fate and fate alone. 
It started with a chance meeting between musicians in a Cambridge bus stop some winter 3 years ago. 3 years on and with plentiful gigging,writing and rehearsing behind them, (not to mention members coming and going) Gamarra currently find themselves with the strongest line-up to date and more determined than ever to rip a hole in your leg with their sound. 
Gamarra is a blend of many different outlooks on the metal ideology brought into one, a natural blending of the wide spectrum of the genre that always goes down smooth. 

The music retains a unique perspective on the death metal sound that does not shy away from melody or creativity, tipping its hat to its old school inspirations as well as endeavoring to better itself as much as possible... always opting to achieve even beyond that.
