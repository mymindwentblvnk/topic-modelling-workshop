Exidium was founded in summer 2001 by musicians from Dresden. Lack of time and a change of instrumentation were the reasons for the stagnating project status in the first years. So the year 2007 was going to be the turning point in the development of the band. In July 2007 the structure of the band changed. With David and Axel at the guitars weâ€™ve got 2 guys completing each other perfectly. Stefan is the groove-machine on the bassguitar. In cooperation with Thomas, who is hitting the drums, they deliver the punching bottom of Exidium. Due to his extraordinary voice we chose Alex as Exidium's lead singer. Each of the members brought another influence to the band, which causes the new unique sound and style. This way, the band has the possibility to let their progressive steamroller, with various elements of metal and core, again and again loose on the audience, without letting nailed stylistically. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Exidium">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
