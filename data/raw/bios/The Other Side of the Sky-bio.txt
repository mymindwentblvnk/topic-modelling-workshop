The Other Side Of The Sky from Daytona Beach, Florida deliver a unique brand of ambient sludge metal related to bands like Isis, Neurosis and Mogwai. The band was created in early 2002 by Michael Brown and Paul Weeks as a forum for their developing ideas and a desire to play the music they wanted to hear. Since then the band have played over 80 shows, toured the Eastern USA/Canada and self-released 2 cd's, the most recent of which entitled 'Heritage' was recorded at Austin Enterprises with Steve Austin of Today Is The Day. Having heard that release, Retribute Records were blown away by it's intensity and sense of dynamics and went about signing the band for their first label released cd entitled 'Rorschach' which was recorded at Godcity Studios under the guidance of Kurt Ballou (Converge). It is a representation of massive volume inducing emotion, combining droning riffs and subtle effects-induced builds. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Other+Side+of+the+Sky">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
