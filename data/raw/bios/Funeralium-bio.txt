Funeralium is a doom metal band from Paris, France. They describe their style as "ultra sick doom" and play tortured, disturbed, extreme doom metal without any romantic vibes, female vocals, circus keyboards and cheesy lyrics.

The group was founded in June 2003 by Marquis, who wanted to create one of the sickest doom band on this planet, inspired by bands like Bethlehem, Abruptum, Thergothon, Saint Vitus and Burning Witch. Berserk (who also plays with Marquis in Ataraxie) joined the band, soon followed by Yskithyrwynn and Toxine (from the Celtic black metal band Heol Telwen).

In September 2003 the first rehearsals began and the band started to work on tracks like "Transcendance NÂº 26" and "Funeralium". Then in March 2004, they were offered a deal for a demo by Bang or Be Banged, an underground metal label. One month later they recorded this demo that they decided to call "Ultra Sick Doom" in honour of German sick gods Bethlehem with their first album "Dark Metal". This demo was released in June 2004 and received great feedbacks from the underground metal community.

In 2007 the band released their first self-titled full-length album, which was followed in 2013 by a second full-length titled "Deceived Idealism".
