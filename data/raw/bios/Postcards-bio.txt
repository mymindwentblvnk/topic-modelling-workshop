There are several bands named Postcards:

1.) Postcards is a dream pop trio formed in 2012 in Beirut, Lebanon. Their music is defined by hushed vocals floating over expansive soundscapes that shift between harsh noise and dreamy atmospheres. They have released 3 full-length albums and 3 EPs, all co-produced by Tunefork Studios' Fadi Tabbal.

Their third album, After the Fire, Before the End, came out on October 15, 2021. Written between January 2020 and January 2021, the album is a record of the devastating year that the country witnessed, through the eyes of the band; the slow demise of an uprising, the economic collapse, a crushing pandemic, and the explosion. 

Postcards are:
 Julia Sabra (lead vocals, guitar, synths)
 Marwan Tohme (guitar, bass, backing vocals)
 Pascal Semerdjian (drums, sampler, backing vocals)
