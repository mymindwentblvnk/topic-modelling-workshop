Karpe Diem is a Norwegian hip-hop duo consisting of Magdi Omar Ytreeide Abdelmaguid (aka. Magdi) and Chirag Rashmikant Patel (aka. Chicosepoy or Chico). Magdi is half egyptian and half Norwegian, while Chirag is all Indian. 

They formed in 2000 in Oslo, Norway and released their first EP in 2004, Glasskår. They later released their first full-lenght album titled Rett fra hjertet in 2006.

Karpe Diem was established when the two wanted to enter a music competition, which they ended up winning with the song "Hvor er Willy?" and have been rapping together ever since. 

They have performed live at more than 200 shows and the number is just growing. Karpe Diem is notorious for their sarcastic and politically engaged lyrics, and for their down-to-earth and nobel personalities. 

On March 5th, 2011, they received the greatest Norwegian musical prize there is, "Årets Spellemann".
This was the first time in history that a hip-hop/rap group received this award.
