Now residing in Sydney, Luke Dubs and Elgusto grew up in the Blue Mountains where they took up musical instruments at a young age. They’ve played together with Elgusto’s sister Aja in a funk/jazz group called Funk Injection since their early teens.

Elgusto has DJ'd and played percussion with Paulmac and The Dissociatives... He’s also played with The Bird, Wes Carr, Explanetary, The Herd, Upshot and Paulmac. You can also check his DJing at various events and clubs.

Luke Dubs is a full-time musician working the keyboard craft in many acts including Explanetary, Vassy, Funk Injection and Guache. He graduated from the Australian Institute of Music with an Associate Diploma in contemporary Keyboard.

Players of multi-instruments, Hermitude combine drum programming, sampling and mixing with turntablism, keys, bass and percussion…with a little help from a few vocalists. Vocal tracks are few though, across their two albums. 

These include 'Alleys to Valleys' off their album of the same name, released in 2003 (with MC's Urthboy and Ozi Battla of the Herd, and Joelistics), as well as 'Music From the Mind' off their latest album, released in September 2005 (with vocalist; Blu MC) <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hermitude">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
