TK Webb is one of New York City’s best-kept secrets; the bluesman, best recognized by his scratchy voice and phenomenal capabalities as a guitarist, has been a staple of the Lower East Side’s live music circuit for the last 7 years. The multi-instrumentalist, originally from Missouri, has been touring consistently since he was a teenager, providing him with depth as a performer and songwriter that transcends genre. 
With just a guitar and a suitcase drum, TK Webb is the  modernday-troubadour who plays the blues as soulful and gristle as it was supposed to be. His music is a uniquely haunting blend of folk and country-infused psychedelic blues. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/TK+Webb">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
