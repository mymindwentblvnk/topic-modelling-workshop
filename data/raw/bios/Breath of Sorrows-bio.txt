The name Breath of Sorrows was something Belial personally believed in and decided the name fit for his creation, Breath of Sorrows was formed by Lord Scorpius and Belial. Breath of Sorrows was in the creation for about 5 years, recorded a demo with 7 tracks some of the tracks that were on the original demo the songs were titled, “Depths and Solitude”( original recording) and “War Cries” (original recording on are up coming release with Wraith Productions) and “Come Forth”( without any vocals on that track were added for “Come Forth”  for the Wraith Productions only, and the rest of our demo in mid-late ‘98 was just scrap, Breath of Sorrows didn’t do anything and just watched the scene destroy themselves and finally we came back and recorded a demo that was self-titled, which included the track list listed below. The demo was only 100 copies, then Wraith Productions decided to pick us up, now its going to have the 2 songs we've used for the ‘98 demo and the self-titled demo put out 2004. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Breath+of+Sorrows">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
