The band was formed in Moscow in 2003 by Rouben Kazariyan, former mastermind of the leading Russian progressive metal band Nordream. In mid-2002 he left the band and soon joined the legendary Russian metal act - Ens Cogitans. After a short while he decided to work out his own music outside Ens Cogitans under another moniker. Rouben recruited the drummer, Vladimir Muchnov (Ens Cogitans, Frenzied Efforts, ex-Catharsis) and bassist Mikhail Korolev (his ex-colleague in Nordream). Later they were joined by incredible female vocalist, Liisa Lagoun who came from acid jazz scene. After months of hard work the new band tentatively called Southwake came up with great amount of material and began recording their first CD.   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Southwake">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
