Tristram may refer to several artists.

1. Tristram is the abandoned moniker of a Swedish solo musician who recorded a demo during 2006-2007, which was later released as a full-length on the label Elitmusik.  


2. Tristram is four people from London playing seven (usually) instruments, and singing about a variety of subjects, including but not limited to: zombies, James Dean, assorted authors, love stories, love-going-wrong stories, ships, bicycles, astral travel and fruit.
