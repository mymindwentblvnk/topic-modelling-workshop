Parts & Labor were a US experimental rock/noise rock band signed to Jagjaguwar Records. The group was formed in 2002 by B.J. Warshaw and Dan Friel in Brooklyn, NY and has since toured with other bands such as Battles, TV on the Radio, Deerhoof, Voltage, Breaker! Breaker!, Tyondai Braxton, Coachwhips, Japanther, Pterodactyl, and Matt & Kim.

Hailing from Brooklyn, Parts & Labor are a boisterous bunch of art kids that combine sparse electronics, wiry guitars and pop hooks into uplifting experimental noise rock.

Forming in 2002 after bassist BJ Warshaw and keyboardist Dan Friel met at the knitting factory, the band have toured relentlessly with Christopher Weingarten on drums, finding that their avant-garde noise rock fit in very well with the scenes being carved out by TV on the Radio and Deerhunter.

After the departure of Weingarten to pursue a blogging career, the band recruited Joe Wong for their Autumn 2007 dates. Finding second guitarist in renowned sound artist Sarah Lipstate, their sound had become more experimental, but still retained enough of that noisy pop magic to keep it accessible.

Parts and Labor has been called "the best band nobody's heard of, and yeah, the new stuff completely rules" (See feature article, linked below).
