Livia Sura are a band from Timisoara, Romania, who play heavy music inspired by punk, crust, folk, heavy sludge blues, black metal, etc. The majority of the lyrics are in Romanian and their subjects deal with conflicting ideas: critique of aspects of society, escapism, history and the organization of "life" on one side, and unreasonable hope and trust in values associated with humanity on the other.
