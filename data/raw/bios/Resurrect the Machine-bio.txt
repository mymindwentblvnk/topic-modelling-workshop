Born in the wake of classic metal acts such as Led Zeppelin and Metallica, while also peppering modern influences into the mix such as System Of A Down and Lamb Of God, Resurrect The Machine are an intensely heavy (yet remarkably accessible) force to be reckoned with. Formed in Los Angeles by guitarist Andre Makina and singer Dean Ortega (who has seen varying levels of success from former projects such as Neverland, and Tribe Of Gypsies), the duo began writing songs together, with Andre creating the music, and Dean arranging the compositions.  After realizing the songs being written were top-notch, Andre decided to bring in powerhouse drummer and close friend Joey Cotero, whom he had worked with in an earlier project involving ex-Metallica guitarist Lloyd Grant.
The trio then began the long and arduous process of searching for a versatile bass player with the skill needed to handle the intense guitar work that was becoming the band's signature. After many auditions, the group finally came into contact with Kurt Barabas (formerly of award-winning progressive rock band Under The Sun) through a mutual friend of Dean's.  With the final lineup in place at last, the group began recording their blistering debut album, releasing their eponymous first single in the process.
