Davola is a solo metal project from independent musician Aaron Cloutier that takes  the intensity of extreme metal and all the subgenres  and incorporates elements of more exotic styles such as  jewish jazz and world music. 

 The end result being a seemless melding pot of styles that serve to take the listener on a journey but not straying too far outside the box as there is great attention to arrangement and structure within each song.   Davola is one man's interpretation of what his version of  the radio would sound like if the members of Meshuggah got drunk with avant garde composer John Zorn in a club in hell one night.

Eclectic, experimental but first and foremost heavy.  Davola is metal music with a large emphasis on both sides.  As heavy as it is musical.

New album "DICHOTOMY" available NOW on I-tunes!
