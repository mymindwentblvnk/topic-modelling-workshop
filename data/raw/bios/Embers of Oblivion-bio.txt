Embers of Oblivion is a Dutch Death Metal band, with members hailing from different parts of the country. The roots of this band lie with other metal bands, but in Embers of Oblivion all comes together.
The band was formed by Lars and Marco in 2014. Songs were written, and soon the band recorded their debut album “Dark the Winter Frost” which was released in 2015.

After the release of this first album there were some line-up changes, but after some time Maarten joined the band as guitarist, Nomiss as a bass player and Haat as vocalist. At this point Embers of Oblivion was ready for the next step. Gigs followed and new material was written.
