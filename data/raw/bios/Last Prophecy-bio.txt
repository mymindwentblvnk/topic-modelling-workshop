Heavy Metal act LAST PROPHECY was founded in 1998 by former ADVERSUS guitarist Juanmi Álvarez. The initial formation also saw the inclusion of singer Aitor Ortiz, rhythm guitarist Antonio Torres, bassist Iban Viedma and drummer Ion Etxebarri. In 2001 Eguzki Abad took over the role on rhythm guitar. Further changes in 2002 saw the acquisition of Asier Lantz on drums and bass player Rubén Castellano. This version of LAST PROPHECY cut the debut album, 'Jugando Con Sueños', for EDG Music, promoting this release with support to TIERRA SANTA in 2003.
Minus Castellanos, the group recorded the second album 'Sin Mirar Atrás' for early 2005 issue. Subsequent, Onix Pinto was added on bass.
