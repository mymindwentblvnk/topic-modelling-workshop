There are two bands with the name Infinitum


1. A Technical Death Metal Band
2. An Ambient Music Band

Infinitum is an Australian brutal/technical death metal band.

The band  formed in 2005, arising from the ashes of two of Canberraâ€™s most prominent metal bands; Psychrist and Dehuman.

After the demise of Dehuman, and Psychrist, some of the band members still shared a common desire to create music that composes of brutal death metal and technical death metal, so work began on some inital tracks. In 2006 a self-titled demo was recorded, and some gigs were played, which seemed to be generate a lot of interest in the metal community.

After a few lineup changes, the band is now comprised of musicians who all have similar goals; to play extreme music that is interesting, and to bring it to the public. The release of their self-released debut album "Behold Eradication"  there are plans to tour in Australia, and to see what opportunities lie overseas.

The band is currently searching for a drummer. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Infinitum">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
