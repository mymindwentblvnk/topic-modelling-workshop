Sindustry is Heavy-Metal made in Frankfurt, Germany. Since 2010, Sindustry has reinterpreted the Heavy Metal Music of the 90's Heavy-Metal
in modern style with their own 'sindustrial' trait. Clear and riff-based structures characterize the impulsive Heavy-Metal songs such as emotional Rock-Ballads.

The band Sindustry exists since 2013 in the current cast. The first steps occured way back in 2008 with a slightly different cast, but it actually didn't work out so well. 
Jörg and Karl incidentally met again in 2010 at a concert in Frankfurt and decided to give the project another shot. 
Martin, who was already a member of the first cast was immediately excited and took the spot of the technical experienced bass player. 
Flo, who was strongly recommended by drummer Karl, joined the band just a little later and improved the bands versatility with his tremendous guitar skills. 
Jörg came up with a lot of raw and unreleased song-material from previous projects. The music instantly hit the taste of each one and the songs were 
re-invented by using the styles of each bandmember adding the unique 'sindustrial' trait to the music. The band rehearsals take place in an old farmhouse near Frankfurt. 
Andy joined the band in October 2013 by blewing everyones mind with his powerfull voice at a singer-audition. 
At the same time, the band started the recordings of their first demo-track 'Inside of Me', which was originally written and pre-recorded in 1998. 
Sindustry is constantly working, improving and writing to evolve and reach their ambitious goals and to unleash the 'sindustrial' metal on the stages of this world. 

The first EP was be unleashed in March '16. More information on the official bandpage:
