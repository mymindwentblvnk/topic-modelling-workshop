In Nova Scotia circa a musical project by the name of"Ashes of Christ" was formed by Dramen/ChaseHellvomit (of Snowfall) and IV. Time passed and distance remained between them and nothing transpired until the April 9th, 2007. Six rough tracks were almost entirely written and recorded in a small window of 3 weeks in Chaseâ€™s basement in Alberta, Canada. These are demo tracks from that recording session, but remain a strong example and preliminary taste of the music for this project. Currently Chase resides in British Columbia Canada, where plans to resume recording over the summer will take place.
