Armed with their debut album, Melbourne based melodic hard rock band 'into the night' have arrived and are gearing up to take the Australian rock scene by force! Spending the best part of the last 2 years building their own professional recording studio, and then tracking the new record themselves, the boys attracted some of the biggest names in the music world to join the party. Written, recorded and produced by the band, the tracks were then given the Midas touch at RadioStar Studios in California by mix master Rich Veltrop (Rage Against the Machine) and recording royalty Sylvia Massy (Tool, Johnny Cash, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Smashing Pumpkins).
