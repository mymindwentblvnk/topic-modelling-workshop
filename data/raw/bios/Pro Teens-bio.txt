Pro Teens is a grungy, retro pop band born in the concrete desert of Phoenix, Arizona. Since their formation in 2014, Andy Phipps (vocals/guitar), Matthew Tanner (drums), Zack Parker (bass) have been staples of the band, seeing a rotating cast of talent from the Phoenix music scene over the years. Their newest member, B Bohannon (synth/organ) added in 2018, is a solid and refreshing addition to the newly reformed Pro Teens.
Their first album, self-titled Pro Teens, was released in September 2015, bright and buzzing with electric charm. Pro Teens’ sound finds the middle ground between pop and garage punk, a sundazed sound constructed from shimmering guitars, catchy rhythms, and robust vocals with undeniable character. Bright guitar riffs and bouncing bass lines are reminiscent of 50’s/60’s surf rock and rock ‘n’ roll, with a gritty and unique southwestern flare. Pro Teens have consistently written new music in between their tours. 
Unafraid of experimentation, Pro Teens curates songs that are full of whimsy and energy with every turn. Released in July of 2016, Accidentally shows us a softer, dreamier side of Pro Teens. While sticking to their roots of garage rock/punk, the group shows their ability to embrace dream pop and make it their own.
