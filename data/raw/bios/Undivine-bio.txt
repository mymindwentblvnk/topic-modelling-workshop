Undivine was founded in the beginning of 2005 as Svartalv by Erik Kumpulainen, Kristofer Nilsson and Robert Fältström. Kristofer was at this time also playing in Withered Beauty and he asked their drummer Jonas Lindström if he was interested of the drummer's position, and he accepted without hesitation.

This line-up lasted for a while but Kristofer and Erik who handled the vocals at the time came to the conclusion that a lead singer was needed. Luckily Jonas knew of an old friend who just had moved to Gävle and was in search for a band. Said and done, Tommy Holmer tried out and there was no question about it, he was perfect for the band.

After a few months of rehearsing the band entered MHM studios and during 4 days of February, 2006 the demo "Behind Thy Eyes" was recorded. In the studio the band changed their name to Undivine for a more international approach. Demonical Records contracted the band for "Behind Ehy Eyes", and it will soon be released as a limited, handnumbered EP of 150 copies.
