Terra Caput Mundi was conceived in 2005 by Jared to converge two things quite dear to him: dark science fiction and ripping heavy metal. A lineup proved elusive, so in late 2006 he recorded three songs for a split demo with Michigan-based occult blackthrashers RÖT, by himself, performing all instruments and vocals. The “Hell Cosmic Space Thrash” demo made its way around the 'zine circuit and CDR-trading community and was met with open arms and banging heads. In mid 2007, a full lineup assembled, first by locating drum-mistress Sarah, whose skin pounding skills were a more-than-welcome addition to the band. The search for a guitarist took far less time, as Thrash Attack Zack volunteered his speed-shredding skills with much haste. The three recorded a five-song rehearsal demo in September M3/007 to showcase the new songs and lineup, in preparation for the debut album "Warp Speed Warriors", which was unchained upon the cosmos in late 2008. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Terra+Caput+Mundi">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
