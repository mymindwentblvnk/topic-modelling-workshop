SACRADIS centred was founded during mid 1996 by vocalist Argento, guitarist Eligor, bass player Winternius, Summus Dux on keyboards and drummer Lord Of Fog. The band soon shifted shape, adding second guitarist Ülfe and switching faces to incorporate new lead vocalist and keyboard player. Another change at the front saw Labes as new singer. With this line up SACRADIS cut the five track 1998 EP 'Sacradis Infernalis'. The membership was still far from settled though as both Ülfe and Hel exited.Labes followed shortly after and the band inducted Kadath as their fourth successive singer. After recording an eponymous promotional EP in 2000 SACRADIS welcomed Ülfe back into the fold. The new album "Darkness of Our Souls" marks a new period of the bend, with very aggressive songs and attitude and underlines their new future consituent steps.
