Mauro (Italy) and Onyee (Hong Kong) met in London when they worked as ushers in a cinema.
They created  many tunes of rock'n'roll & disco blues during their breaks, and began to play shows as a duo.
Later they formed SUNNY DAY SETS FIRE, joined by their multi-instrumentalist friend Max (italy) and they finally started recording their first DEMO as a trio on December 2004. The first single, Brainless, was released in February 2006 on Brikabrak Rec. and the band decided to include a new member one month later. 
With Ed (UK) on bass SDSF, they were  officially a quartet. They've been described as "an upbeat Postal Service with added trumpets and drums with the volume turned high" (XFM).  In 2007, they added a new member on Drums - Matthew from Canada taking them to quintet status. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sunny+Day+Sets+Fire">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
