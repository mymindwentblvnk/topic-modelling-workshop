Relatively unknown seven months ago, Preditah’s ascension to the top of the Grime scene this year (2011) has been nothing less than extraordinary. JME’s enigmatic ‘PRE DI TAH’ tweets throughout February this year sparked wider intrigue around the Birmingham producer and ensured his debut release, the ‘Solitaire E.P’, shot to number four in the iTunes electronica charts, receiving plays across 1Xtra, KISS FM and Rinse FM in the process.
