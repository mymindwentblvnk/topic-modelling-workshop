Grip Inc. was a groove/thrash metal band, and a side project of drummer Dave Lombardo (Slayer, Fantômas), German producer Waldemar Sorychta and British singer Gus Chambers. 

The band was formed in 1993 under the name Grip as a five-piece band featuring former Overkill bass player Bobby Gustafson on second guitar. After Gustafson and  bass player Chaz Grimaldi  left the band, Grip Inc hired Jason Viebrooks (Heathen) and recorded their first album, The Power Of Inner Strength. The release of the album was followed by European tour with Motörhead and, later, with Kreator. After releasing their second album in 1997, Viebrooks was replaced by Stuart Carruthers. 

The release of their third album, Solidify, in 1999 was followed by a co-headlining tour with Italian band Lacuna Coil (one of the many bands produced by Sorychta). Despite Dave Lombardo's return in Slayer in 2001, Grip Inc released a fourth album in 2004.

Since then, Sorychta founded  Eyes Of Eden and Enemy Of the Sun while Gus Chamber joined Squealer A.D.. On 16th August 2008, Gus Chambers joined Enemy Of The Sun on stage for an exclusive Grip Inc. oriented set In Bochum (Germany).

Unfortunately, Gus Chambers passed away on October 13, 2008 at the age of 52. Chambers, who resided in Coventry, England, reportedly took his own life.
