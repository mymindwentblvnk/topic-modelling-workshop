ScarsiN currently consists of 2 members. Rick "Rocket" Valley on drums/bass, along with Felipe "SkasH" Alvarez on guitars and vocals. The two started to rehearse in the Chicago-land area in March of 2012. Since then, the two have gone on to play shows and began recording their debut album "SHADOWBEAST" set to be released in December of 2014. The project is currently looking for a bass player and guitarist to join the passion and vision of this project. More shows, merch, and tours are all goals to be met in the upcoming days.... <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Scarsin">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
