Stefan Fuss presents his mix of Dub, Broken Beats & Psychedelia on Switchstance Recordings under his alias Protassov. The endless supplies of analogue equipment, rare vinyl and the rogue ambience of his very own ceiling studio Mechano Tonatelier inspire Protassov to undertake ever new musical trips, the aim of which is most definitely the tripping itself.

The multiple instrumentalist and sound engineer has played at events and festivals all over Europe with the renowned techno live outfit T.E.V.O. in the mid-90s. In his own studio Protassov now produces all kinds of styles, creates remixes and devotes his time to new Switchstance tunes.
