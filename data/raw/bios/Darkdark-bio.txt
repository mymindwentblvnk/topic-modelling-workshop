1. Darkdark is a band from Lockport, Illinois formed in 2001. The band released a demo in 2001 as a solo artist (E. Henderson known as Wavy) and then ended the project. In 2003 the band returned with members Zuulfahkar Grav as lead vocalist and bassist and Lava as an additional vocalist though most recordings do not have Lava heard. Wavy still used guitars and drums and he was a secondary vocalist. The band released Burning Winter Burns.....Set Me Frozen Ablaze in 2003 which was more of a rawer and noisier release. Later in 2004 the band made a split with Lavome (Wavy's electronic project) and did a live album with music videos. The band released their EP A Tree In the Forest which was less raw and nosier and became more serious. Then in early 2005 the band released Buried Beneath which was possibly a rerecording of the first 2 releases. In 2004 E. became a Christian and wanted to use these lyrics in the band. The band then released Overwhelming Grimness which was recorded during the time Zuulfahkar and Lava left making then participate in only one song while E. took the band back to himself. The band released continuous EPS and compilations until E. changed the name to Light Shall Prevail and made more albums.

E. is no longer a Christian and has retired Light Shall Prevail
