They Came Burning is a metalcore band from Austin in Texas, formed in 2001.

From Stereokiller:

Take all of the ambition you've ever had in life, add a heart of gold, don't forget the stubbornness of a bull, throw in a bit of sex appeal, a ton of fun, and you get Texas's own They Came Burning.

Do these guys know when to say when? Hell no! They are living out a dream and refuse to let anything get in their way; be it constant member changes, school obligations, broken-down vans, faulty booking agents, or any of the other tons of roadblocks they've encountered over the years. TCB has nothing but history originally rooted in one small town in Texas.

Now a recognizable national act, they have become one of the hardest working and most well-respected bands in the South. With their debut full-length released on November 25, 2003 through Counterintelligence Recordings, TCB is proving to the rest of the hardcore industry that hard work and dedication do pay off, and that dreams really can come true. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/They+Came+Burning">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
