3) Foe are a band from London, UK. October, 2003 saw the release of their debut album ‘Arm Yourself with Clairvoyance’. Although instrumental, Foe found their voice on this album through strong and bizarre melodies, often very linear, and always delivered with brute force. In November, 2003 they released ‘The Combined Stupidity of Spiteful Men’, a split album with their friends American Heritage and Art of Burning Water. There was a UK tour in support of this release featuring all three bands. They played shows with the likes of The Dillinger Escape Plan, Prong and Mastodon.

Reviews for the debut album were abundant with magazines like Rock Sound and Metal Hammer championing the release and over 50 online zines saying good things.

In October 2003 their bass player Crawford Blair parted company and Steve Woodcock took his place playing a 10-string Chapman Stick.

Their next album ‘Siafu’ will hopefully be released in 2008.
