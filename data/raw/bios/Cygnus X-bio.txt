The brainchild of Eye-Q label-head Matthias Hoffman Cygnus X has released the trance album Hypermetrical in 1995 for the Eye-Q label.  Best known for the trance classic: Superstring.

Cygnus X was a trance project named after the famous X-ray binary Cygnus X-1. It began as a collaboration between Matthias Hoffmann & Ralf Hildenbeutel (who later left). Other projects of the pair include A.C. Boutsen, Brainchild and Dee.FX. Their sound is extending from hard to ambient trance. Their first release was the well known Superstring in 1993, but they enjoyed wide success with their trance classic The Orange Theme (1994). Their releases Positron and Hypermetrical became also well known hits of the genre.
