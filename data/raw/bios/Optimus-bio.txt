A young aspiring band from Western Australia, they released their first song on an online forum, and still remain relatively unheard of.

Unfortunately, the band this year broke up after 8 years together. Brett (a member of the band) has now gone solo and intends to tour Canada in the following years. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Optimus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
