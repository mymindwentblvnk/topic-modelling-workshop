27 year old Jeremy Loops is a modern day one-man folk band. Born out of necessity whilst working on yachts around the World, Jeremy discovered that there's no-one better to work with than yourself.

Now as the name may suggest, Jeremy has embraced technology in all its illustrious forms and creates his finely woven tapestry of sounds using his Guitar, Ukelele, harmonica and beatbox skills. He runs this all through a gamut of loop pedals, echo and distortion units and through the speakers to leave a crowd quite literally awe-struck, standing there going..."where is this all coming from?"

And there's the buzz word - Crowd.
Whereas Jeremy still sees his project as having the right amount of "pop-sensibility" that will appeal to a mass audience from a listening point of view, he much prefers playing live. Interactivity and crowd participation are key to the creation of his multi-layered structure of beats and rhythms. Having built his career from a very early stage with rapper, Trak, the two exude a perfectly ordered mish-mash of folk, hip-hop, blue-grass funk and blues.

Not simply content with growing his own musical career, Jeremy is also quite literally growing Cape Town and South Africa, heading up the agricultural revolution that is GreenPop - An initiative which is spearheading the conscious push to plant more trees and reduce carbon emissions, amongst other noble ideals.
