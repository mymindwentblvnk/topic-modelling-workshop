Multi-Instrumentalist/Producer Zo! is Detroit-area born and raised Lorenzo Ferguson.

Music was always present in and around the Ferguson house, which led to Zo! taking piano lessons at age 6… which he absolutely despised. The idea of working toward a Major League Baseball career, served as the greatest inspiration through his teenage years, much more so than the concept of practicing music.  After his parents consistently pushed and encouraged him to stick with music, Zo! discovered a new-found passion, by teaching himself how to play piano by ear, by age 11.  Zo! got his production start in 1992, when his parents brought home a Proteus MPS keyboard and a Brother PDC100 sequencer for him to figure out.  Since then, he has emphasized the use of live instrumentation as the blueprint for his music, while constantly looking to expand his sound with each album release.
