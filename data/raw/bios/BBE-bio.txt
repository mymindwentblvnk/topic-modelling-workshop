Inspired equally by trance and new age music, the dream-house unit BBE was formed in 1996 by producers Bruno Sanchioni, Bruno Quartier and Emmanuel Top. The trio of French/Itailan techno experts came together with a debut single, "Seven Days and One Week," which became a hit at clubs from Ibiza to London and ascended into the Top Five of the British charts. Though Quartier left immediately after the single's success, Sanchioni and Top's follow-up "Flash" also hit the Top Five, alongside similar tunes by Sash! and Robert Miles in a wave of chart-bound dream house. ZYX Records issued the compilation Early Works in 1997, and BBE released their debut album Games one year later. Emmanuel Top also has a solo career, with productions on NovaMute and Le Petit Prince. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/BBE">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
