3's EVE was born in 1997 as a Gothic band with (founding member) Shava on guitar and vocals (and lyrics as well), Gianluca Gallo on bass guitar  and Bill Schunemann on drums, keyboards and backing vocals. The band released a 4 song (self titled) e.p. at the end of that same year. 3's EVE made a rather drastic change shortly after that to become a Gothic METAL band. Shava switched to the bass guitar and Gianluca switched to guitar. In 2000 the band released a full length CD called "Awakening" featuring Tom Croxton (of the infamous shock rock band, Impaler) on the drums. The band played throughout the Twin Cities of Minnesota for quite a while before going on hiatus. 3's EVE formed again on the east coast in New Jersey . Shava remained on the bass (and writing all the lyrics) and returned to vocals as well. The band released a 5 song e.p. called "Let The Killing Begin" and then eventually a full length CD called "Giving Up The Ghost" followed shortly after. The band is once again on hiatus (and NOW in the Kansas City area of Missouri). Shava is working on new songs to reform the band and rise once again from the ashes. www.3seve.cjb.net
