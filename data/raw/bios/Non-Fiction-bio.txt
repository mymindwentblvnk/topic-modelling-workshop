Non-Fiction was formed from the ashes of Hades, when founder Dan Lorenzo decided to go in a slightly different direction. The band's sound retains some of the Hades style and energy, but in general this band is slower and grungier, somewhat like a cross between Hades and Soundgarden. It's an excellent mix -- furthermore, vocalist Alan Tecchio sounded more at home here than he did in Hades or Watchtower. Though all three albums are similar in style, the latter two are better-produced, more diverse, and therefore better albums. The band broke up some time after the third album, with Lorenzo and Tecchio back in the reformed Hades.
