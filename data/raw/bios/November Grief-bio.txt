November Grief was an all-female death metal band from Montreal, Quebec, Canada, founded in May 1994 by Stéphanie Masson (vocals, bass), Véronique Lambert (guitars) and Annie Leclerc (drums).  

Stéphanie and Annie created a band named Mistrust in November 1993. After going through difficulties finding others to play the style of music they enjoyed, Stéphanie decided to take on the task of playing bass. When they met with guitarist Véronique, they also changed the name of the band to November Grief. According to the band, this name fit the music better.
In November 1994 they recorded a first demo titled "Evil-Ution". In 1995 guitarist Chantal Levesque joined the band. A second and last demo, titled "To Live... in This World of Chaos", was released in December 1995.

After that the band played several gigs in Quebec, but in 1997 they split-up. However, some of the members are still contributing to the metal scene. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/November+Grief">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
