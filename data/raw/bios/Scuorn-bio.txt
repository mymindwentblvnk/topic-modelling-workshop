SCUORN was born to worship the cult of Parthenope by revealing the most ancient legends and history of the mysterious Neapolitan lands, known over the centuries for their hellenic and roman origins and for being fervent cradle of the Italian culture.
The epic black metal atmospheres, strongly influenced by the world famous “canzone napoletana”, and the sound of traditional folk instruments melt with majestic orchestrals and evocative lyrics in native language, express the concept of the band at its best.
Founded in Naples (Italy) in 2008 by Giulian (Vocals, All Instruments & Orchestral Arrangements), SCUORN (which means "shame" in Neapolitan language) will soon release the debut album “PARTHENOPE”, recorded mixed and mastered at the world-acclaimed 16th Cellar Studio in Rome in 2016 by the producer Stefano “Saul” Morabito (FLESHGOD APOCALYPSE, HOUR OF PENANCE)
Very special guest on the album is the “maestro” Riccardo Studer from Italian extreme epic metal pioneers STORMLORD, who shaped an impressive orchestra who reminds of bands such as DIMMU BORGIR and SEPTICFLESH for epicness and greatness.
The concept album is focused on the most ancient greek-roman origins of Naples, and each song is related to a specific legend from those times, such as the 79 a.d. volcano Vesuvio’s eruption who destroyed Pompeii and many others.
Scuorn has recently signed a two-albums deal with the italian label DUSKTONE (Opera IX, Svartelder, Enisum), which will release "Parthenope" at the very beginning of 2017. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Scuorn">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
