Dawn Richard, born August 5, 1983 in New Orleans, Louisiana, is an American R&B singer-songwriter. Formerly signed to Bad Boy Records, she was one-fifth of the female Pop/R&B group Danity Kane, formed by Sean "Diddy" Combs in 2005 on the 3rd installment of the hit MTV series Making The Band. Following the group's official disbandment in 2009, Richard was invited to stay with Bad Boy and join the new group Diddy - Dirty Money alongside Diddy and R&B singer Kalenna. Diddy - Dirty Money released one studio album before splitting in early 2012, after which Richard left Bad Boy to peruse a solo career as an independent artist. 

In 2011 Richard released her debut mixtape A TELL TALE HEART, followed in 2012 by the EP Armor On, her first official solo release and a prelude to her full-length album Goldenheart, released independently on January 15, 2013. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dawn+Richard">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
