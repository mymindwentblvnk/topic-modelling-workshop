Built to Spill's Doug Martsch finally made room for a solo career in early 2002. This singer/songwriter was an underground, cult hero among the indie crowd, but allowed his eclectic side to come alive in the release of Now You Know that fall. Signed to Warner Bros., Martsch recorded Now You Know in his hometown of Boise at his own Manhouse Studios over the course of 1999 and 2000. His classic assemblage of folk, blues, and classic rock impressed critics, leaving Martsch to craft another musical outlet for himself. Tours across North America followed into early 2003. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Doug+Martsch">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
