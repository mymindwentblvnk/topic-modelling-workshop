Eltro is a four-piece electronic rock band, made of Diana Prescott, Jorge Sandrini, Rick Henderson, and Ted Johnson.
Forming in Philadelphia in 1995, Eltro began performing its brand of lush shoegazer rock around the Pennsylvania area while tightening its sound and putting together several songs. Releasing Information Changer in 1998, the group didn't see too much of an impact beyond the area and recorded Velodrome soon after. Longtime fans at Absolutely Kosher Records contacted the group soon after and acquired the rights to both albums, re-releasing Velodrome in 2001 and their debut in 2002. ~ Bradley Torreano, All Music Guide
