It was 1993 when Roope's band Stone officially called it quits. At the same time Jussi's band, Virago was at the end of it's road.
When both bros were unemployed they decided to start their own instrumental project. Roope had a lot of ideas left from Stone's age. Rehearsal took place in Latvala family's sauna cabin in Lintuvaara, Espoo, Finland.

In the beginning of 1994, after a couple of months of training, bros decided to go and record an album. Album was recorded in an old training place at Lemuntie, Vallila. Bros found two 16 track recorders and tried to synchronize them but it was little bit difficult. Help was found from Santahamina's garrison. One of the radar engineers had an equipment for the synchronizing. Petteri Hirvonen and Ade Mattila were in the other end of the recording table. Petteri played also synths to the album.

Album was mixed at the Finnvox studios and only 600 copies were released. So it's a real collector's item.

After the album was made bros musical roads went separate ways. Roope Latvala joined Waltari's line-up to replace Sami Yli-Sirnio in lead guitars vacancy for a while. Nowadays older bro plays in Children Of Bodom among other bands. Jussi on the other hand had to go in the army at that time. Afterwards he played in several bands, for examble Cosmic Connections. Currently younger bro, Jussi Latvala hit the drums in Anima.

So still alive and rocking with the wooden fucking eye.
