BoneDust are the storytellers of an ancient disenchanted love story that is the true origin of human suffering. A plague that was spawned by the betrayal and misery between two immortal entities. The sounds of God and Death conspiring to tell this story. 2 women, giant stacks, giant drums, guitar, snakes, thunder, celestial arsenal.

Resuming: they are an experimental doom/drone female duo from Providence, USA.
