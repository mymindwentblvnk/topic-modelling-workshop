Zolo, meaning unrestrained behavior, chaos and without companion.

“Zolo” formerly known as Dolla Bill from Doughla City. Zolo was born in London, England, and at the tender age of six, he moved to Brooklyn, New York and within his mid-teen years relocated to Toronto, Canada. The split of his parents played a big impact in his life.  During the “hard years” Zolo poured his energy into sports, he found a love for soccer and had many accomplishments and he received multiple scholarships. But there was still a void in his life.  He ventured into writing poems and songs at the age of 17 and shortly after he joined the group “Doughla City” in 2006. This was the birth of the artist “Dolla Bill”. The “Doughla City” Trio had a rapid success among their peers and even south of the boarder. During this adventure the trio opened up for multiple platinum selling artists: Julez Santana, Rick Ross and Guerilla Zoe to name a few. Just as the groups success was starting to peak each member decided to go on separate ventures. Just when things couldn’t get any worse, Zolo, had to come to terms with the passing of his father. During this difficult time, he turned to his music as a tool to express his sorrow and grief. It is this life altering tragedy that sprung the manifestation of “Zolo”. ** Zolo meaning: unrestrained behavior, chaos and without companion ** Zolo took a strong interest in pop music culture, with influences from artists such as Justin Timberlake. MGMT, Lady Gaga, Kanye West and Kid Cudi, he created a unique, fresh, cocky sound that is like no other. Through all his trials and tribulations, Zolo was introduced to Kurt Gentles (On Time Music Group) from his childhood friend Tayshawn Prinse. And the rest is yet to be seen…………………… Zolo is under ONTIME Music Group (management)/ AMG (Attack Media Group).
