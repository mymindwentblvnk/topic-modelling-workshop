Muthoni Drummer Queen or Muthoni Ndonga is a Kenyan rapper, drummer and cultural entrepreneur. She produces alternative electro-hip-hop music and founded the festivals Africa Nouveau and Blankets & Wine in East Africa.

Muthoni Ndonga was born and raised in Nairobi in Kenya. Since childhood, she wants to become an artist but her parents, middle class modest, try to discourage her. She developed her passion in choirs at school until 2004 when, as a student, she organized her first concert with the help of her friends. In 2008, after having obtained her diploma in international relations and philosophy at the Kenyan university United States International University Africa (USIU Africa), believing that alternative music has little visibility in Kenya, she founded the festival ' 'Blankets & Wine'. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Muthoni+Drummer+Queen">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
