There are two Long Island Sound: 

- Dublin born & based Long Island Sound (Rob Roche & Tim Nolan) have been honing their craft since the DJ/Producer duo’s inception in 2015. Cutting their teeth in Berlin, the pair broke through over 2019 following a release on Bobby Analog’s Body Fusion and their ‘Initial Ascent’ EP on their Signs Of Space imprint. Picking up support from Midland and Bicep, they were then invited to contribute to the ‘Feel My Bicep’ mix series.

Following the success of their second EP on SOS, ‘Broken Signals’, LIS were picked up for DJ Mag’s Fresh Kicks series
and featured on Maribou State’s ‘Fabric Presents’ compilation. Picking up serious momentum over 2019, the duo booked a string of gigs and festivals across Europe, the UK and US, including AVA Festival and Griessmuehle, before coming full circle for their first Boiler Room in their hometown in February 2020.

Despite the constraints of 2020, the pair’s output of music hasn't suffered, with their most recent release gaining support from industry heavyweights including Anja Schneider, Cinthie, Tijana T, Hammer, and Skatebard, to name a few, with their debut LP on the horizon for Spring 2021.

- The others are a math pop band from Newcastle, Australia. They formed in 2009 as Wandering Bear and released a free EP called 'Distance' under that name. They changed their name in 2010 and released 'Long Island Sound' in March of 2011. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Long+Island+Sound">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
