Summer Camp are a London based duo formed in 2009. Having formed by accident after deciding to cover The Flamingos' I Only Have Eyes For You, the band did not initially reveal their identities, claiming to be six Swedish teenagers, but a report by independent music newspaper The Stool Pigeon revealed that they were solo artist Jeremy Warmsley and journalist Elizabeth Sankey. 

Their debut single, Ghost Train, backed with Montgomery Avenue 1984, was released on Moshi Moshi as part of their Singles Club in April 2010. In September 2010, Summer Camp released EP Young, which was followed by a string of singles. Their debut album, Welcome To Condale was released on October 31 2011.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Summer+Camp">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
