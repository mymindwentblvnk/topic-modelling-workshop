The band Gurtholfinn started when Tarem left the immature rock band he was currently in. 
The reason behind leaving was that no-one wanted to practice, and the only reason they even claimed they were in a band was to get girls. 
After being introduced to Metal online by some friends, he quickly became interested in this form of music, and soon became an expert on the legions of bands in both Black and Folk Metal. 
This soon led to a lot of extremely crappy recordings, which have been lost forever. 
The actual idea of Gurtholfinn began in late 2005 as the musical endeavor of Tarem only. 
After months of trying to get stuff recorded, he released a demo titled “Never Forget” in 2006. 
The demo was filled with Doom elements and acoustic guitars. The demo never gained any attention, and never went to any labels.  
In winter of 2006, Trajan joined the band on keys, and Tarem scrambled together his ideas, written only for guitar, and tried to add keyboards to them.
