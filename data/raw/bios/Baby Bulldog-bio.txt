Baby Bulldog is the quirky solo project from Los Angeles, CA., United States-based drummer, Steph Barker (Coast Modern, Kate Nash, Your Smith). Using her percussive nature to set a unique foundation, Steph has created a lo-fi world of strange, yet distinctively imaginative themes. She wrote, produced and performed Baby Bulldogâ€™s debut EP from her home studio in Silver Lake. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Baby+Bulldog">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
