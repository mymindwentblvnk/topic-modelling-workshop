Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts, United States (2013 - Present)  
The origin of Vivid Illusion can be traced back to 2008 during founding guitarist Aki McCullough's teenage years in California.  After numerous iterations, McCullough released Vivid Illusion's instrumental debut album, The Cyclical Nature, in 2013.  Now living in Miami, FL, McCullough put together a full lineup the following year consisting of Anthony Taboada and Max Molander as additional guitarists, Mike Gardell on bass, and Jackson Firlik on drums.  

After a series of live shows, Vivid Illusion's follow-up, Circumnavigation | A, was written as a full band and released in 2015.  Shortly after, members of the band relocated, and as of 2016 the band is now based primarily in Boston, MA.
