Leather Angel was an all girl heavy metal band during the early-mid '80s, that originated as a band called Obsession.  
Due to an existing male band called Obsession, they changed their name to Leather Angel .
The original members: Terry O'Leary (vocals), Cathy Amanti (Bass), Debbie Wolf (guitar), & Krissi North (drums), gained local popularity and an increasing number of fans while playing the club circuit of Los Angeles and So. California areas.
Fronting their metal assault on the club scene, was the sexy Terry O'Leary, who had a very powerful and melodic voice. 
She was often provocatively dressed in tight leather tops and leather g-strings. 
Debbie Wolf was a clad in leather biker. 
Her guitar riffs were a combination heavy power chords accented with pinch harmonics and partially muted leads that were uniquely derived from the blues scale. 
Cathy Amanti played a thick and rich driving bass that stood in the foreground of their music and wasn't compromised like a lot of other bass players. 
Krissi North played deep and powerful drum beats that were emphasized with an echo effect, providing a tonal richness to their songs. 
They released one Mini LP called "We Came To Kill".
In '84 Krissi North left the band to pursue other interests and was replaced with ex-Tantrum drummer, Kerri James. 
Danelle Kern joined the band as a second lead guitarist. 
This line-up almost did a tour with Dio, but the management of both bands had disagreements.
Around early '85, Debbie Wolf left the band to start her own project. 
In mid '85, the remaining four members soon became known as Jaded Lady. 
Their newsletter said the name Jaded Lady was a necessary change, befitting the new line-up, since only Terry & Cathy remained from the original members.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Leather+Angel">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
