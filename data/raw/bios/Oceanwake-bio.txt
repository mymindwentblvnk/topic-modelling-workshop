OCEANWAKE (Luvia, Finland)

Formed in 2009, this new outfit consists of musicians with somewhat diverse backgrounds. Thus, it's no surprise that they do offer quite a refreshing approach to metal music.

Based around slow death/doom metal riffs and a notable absence of clean vocals, their material incorporates elements of prog rock, psychedelia, black metal, post rock - even country. So far, "arctic experimental metal" is perhaps the most befitting description of their style of music. But it's best that you check for yourself!

Here is "The Words of Gods Lie Among Us", the first single from their forthcoming debut album "Kingdom". A physical release as a 7" single will follow. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Oceanwake">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
