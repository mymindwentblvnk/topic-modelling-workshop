Juli is a German rock/pop band consisting of singer Eva Briegel, guitarists Jonas Pfetzing and Simon Triebel, bassist Andreas “Dedi” Herde and drummer Marcel Römer. This line-up hasn't changed since 2000. The band’s name is German for “July”. They come from Gießen, Hesse.

When founded in the 1990s as Sunnyglade, they sang songs in English. After changing their name to Juli and beginning to sing German songs in 2002, they released their first single, Perfekte Welle on June 28, 2004. It reached #2 of the German Top 100 in November, and stayed in the charts for 6 months. Their first album, Es ist Juli was released in August 2004 and stayed in the German charts until July 2006, peaking at #2.

Along with bands such as Wir sind Helden and Silbermond they were one of the most successful German pop bands of the summer of 2004, which re-established songs with German lyrics in the German charts.

In late December 2004, Perfekte Welle (which means “Perfect Wave” in English) was banned from radio and TV stations after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. The media were criticized for that measure because the song has no relation to catastrophes, but is a metaphorical description of a person taking the chance he/she has waited for. The stations expressed particular discomfort with the lines in the bridge: "Now it slowly comes to you, the water hits you in the face" and chorus: "This is the perfect wave, this is the perfect day/Let yourself be carried by it..."

In October 2006 a new CD was released, called “Ein Neuer Tag” (A New Day).
