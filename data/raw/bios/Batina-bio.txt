The band comes from Prekmurje, Slovenia. It has been set up in September 2006, but the idea for the band occured earlier when Stefan Kreslin (former guitarist of Disrespect, Berlin) and Dejan Kustec (guitarist) started writing their first pieces of music. A short time after Dominik Klekl (drums, ex Page-One) and Andrej Mataj (bass, ex Vulvathrone) joined with the band, so they started rehearsals in the dark basement of Dominik. In 2007 Matej Cvetko (vocal, ex guitarist of Arthemida) joined the band and so they were in full composition. In October 2007 they recorded their first Demo CD with four songs for club promotion. The year 2007 was finished with a successful concert at the MIKK in Murska Sobota, Slovenia with more visitors than expected. For 2008 they are planning concerts in Slovenia and abroad as well as the publication of their first CD. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Batina">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
