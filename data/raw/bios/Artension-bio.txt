Artension is a progressive metal supergroup, formed by keyboard virtuoso Vitalij Kuprij.  Kuprij describes the bands' sound as "aggressive neoclassical metal".  Their lyrical topics have ranged from technology and sci-fi to nature and ancient cultures.  Over the years, they have released seven studio albums, most recently Future World in 2005, and have toured Europe and Japan.

Kuprij, along with vocalist John West (of Royal Hunt) and guitarist Roger Staffelbach have appeared on every Artension album.  Drummer Mike Terrana (of Rage, Axel Rudi Pell, and others) and bassist Kevin Chown have appeared on most albums, however Steve DiGiorgio (of Death, Sadus, and others) is the current bassist. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Artension">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
