Motopony is a Seattle-based band that originally began as an outlet for singer/songwriter Daniel Blue's poetry. Crafting songs on a three E-string guitar to match his voice, Daniel played as many shows as he possibly could in his then home of Tacoma. In the summer of 2009 his path crossed once again with producer Buddy Ross (the hip hop pseudonym for Josiah Sherman). Having met years prior while working on other records, Daniel knew that fate had connected them again. The two worked through dozens of songs and by summer's end Buddy Ross had joined Motopony, recruiting Brantley Cady (guitar), Mike Notter (guitar) and Forrest Mauvais (percussionist) to round out the live band.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Motopony">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
