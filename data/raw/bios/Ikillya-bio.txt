IKILLYA is the ferocity that follows the moment of clarity created by the proverbial straw that broke the camel’s back.  The human strength of will has been shown to be capable of achieving the impossible, and never is it more focused than when we are pushed to our absolute limit.  Creating music has been our primary goal as long as we’ve had the cogitative ability to have a primary goal and all too often it is in direct opposition to the realities of everyday life. 
            Our mission is to create heavy music that is exciting to play, forces us each to grow as artists, and elicits raw emotion from the listener. We write from the desperate need for others to hear us and, frankly, play because we are genetically compelled to.  Our new EP Recon is a collection of warning shots assembled from our first adventures as a complete unit.  Each song represents a point in our mutation and a glimpse at what is yet to come.  Recon is the beginning of the war for our lives.
            We hope that our songs can be both our own sonic therapy and the knot at the end of someone else’s rope.  Hang on friends.  Your life is in your hands, and as long as you have air in your lungs, you can conquer the world.
