Cryptic fog was formed in the winter of 2009 by Dave Bennett and Brandon Vespo, the former drummer. They wanted to create some original and meaningful extreme music. Cryptic Fog recorded their debut album Path of the Withering Moon in the winter of 2010 after picking up a full line up with Nate and Mike Shaw. That album is still unreleased. They gigged as an active band for a while before breaking up in August of 2010. Dave continued to write songs and collaborated with Dan Klein in December of 2010 to record some new material. Dan Klein produced the first record and now plays session drums for Cryptic Fog. Nate and Mike Shaw both did session vocals on for The Haunted Past EP. A live lineup is not an option right now due to only having a Guitarist and Drummer who each live in different states. Dave continues to write songs and will continue to release material with Dan Klein and Nate Shaw. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cryptic+fog">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
