Ladybaby was an alternative Japanese kawaii metal band. The group originally consisted of models Kuromiya Rei and Kaneko Rie, along with Ladybeard, the crossdressing persona of Australian professional wrestler Rick Magarey.

On August 1, 2016 , Ladybeard withdrew and the group re-branded itself, now going by The Idol Formerly Known As Ladybaby. 

On November 17, 2017, Kuromiya Rei left the group, citing disillusionment with idol culture and throat problems caused by the extensive touring schedule. This led to the end of the group's time as The Idol Formerly Known as LADYBABY.

In February 2018, the group began teasing a new lineup, with Kaneko Rie being joined by new members Ikeda Nana, Arima Emiri and Karasawa Fuka, subsequently announcing a tour through Spring 2018 in a return to the original LADYBABY moniker. 

On October 29, 2019, it was announced that Ladybaby would suspend all activities on January 13, 2020, after their final show, with a compilation titled Reburn released the same day.
