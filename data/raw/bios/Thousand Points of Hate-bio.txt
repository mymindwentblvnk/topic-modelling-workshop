Formed in late 2002, Thousand Points of Hate - Simon Gordon (ex-Xentrix), Gordie Liu, Paul Le Huray and Nick Degnen - set out to produce uncompromising heavy metal with a modern edge. After a period of rehearsal and live work six tracks of original material were written and recorded in November 2003, and a deal was soon secured with Casket Records.

 The result was 'Scar to Mark the Day' (CSK029, mixed by Mark Mynett of Kill II This - now known as City Of God). The debut EP mixed heavy slabs of guitar with vocals that are in turns hard-edged and unashamedly melodic. 

 Thousand Points of Hate are carving their own niche in the murky underworld of UK heavy metal, with the promise of great things to come.

 In 2005, The band had a few line-up changes. Simon Gordon left the band due to geographical issues (As the band is situated on the Island of Guernsey, and Simon now lives in the UK. He is now part of the new City of God lineup.) and was replaced with Mechanical Lobster's Stacie Blondel. Also entering the fray on rythm guitar was James Le Huray (Paul's younger brother).

 These changes haven't made a dent on TPOH's metal roots, but infact have solidified them with subtle and interesting twists. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Thousand+Points+of+Hate">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
