Well known for his productions Rune Reilly Kolsch has sold millions of records all over the world under his many different monikers and production work includes some of the biggest artist in the world. But something has always been missing.

Being a true techno head, paying homage to his underground roots is very important to him. So he started the slightly mysterious Tattoorecs with his brother Johannes Torpe, and together they are enjoying great success with their blend of romantic techno with strong influences from the heydays of Detroit and Chicago.

With the label’s unique release concept of no titles, only tattoos, the label quickly gathered support from the biggest minimal DJs across the globe; Sven Väth, Richie Hawtin, Magda, Tiefschwarz and Ricardo Villalobos all support these weird and experimental releases. Ink & Needle are the only act signed to the label. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/K%C3%B6lsch">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
