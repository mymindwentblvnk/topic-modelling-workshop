1. Blossoms are an English rock band from Stockport, Greater Manchester. Formed in 2013, the band consists of Tom Ogden (lead vocals, guitar), Charlie Salt (bass, synthesizer, backing vocals), Josh Dewhurst (lead guitar, percussion), Joe Donovan (drums) and Myles Kellock (keyboards, synthesizer, backing vocals). 

They were on the BBC's Sound Of new music list for 2016 where they finished in fourth place. It was commented by the band and several other people that they were one of only two guitar bands on the list, alongside Rat Boy. Blossoms' self-titled debut album was one of the twelve albums nominated for the Mercury Music Prize in 2017.

2. Blossoms is the alias of Melbourne electronic artist, Justin Cantrell. 

He has just self-released his debut EP, meeting places. 

Featuring 4 tracks, including re-takes on previously released singles, ‘Eyes On You’ and ‘Come Together’, the EP encompasses the progression and maturing nature of Cantrell as an artist as well as an ever evolving soundscape that lends itself to elements of chillwave, beats, ambient, dreampop, lo-fi and plenty more.

With an emphasis on live instrumentation, as well as distorted vocals, we feel that Blossoms definitely provides something special within a booming scene, whilst also maintaining an air of accessibility for punters from all circles. meeting places takes all these elements and brings them together to create a world of woozy layered synths and textured samples – before wrapping them up with an overall air of honesty in each recording.
