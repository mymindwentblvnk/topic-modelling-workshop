Ordum is an extreme metal band from Lebanon that started out in the end of 2000 under the name Gothmog. Currently, the members involved in the project are John B (Anuryzm, x-Lamagra), Walid WolfLust (Kaoteon), and Riad H.

The purpose was to deliver extreme music with a different edge and vision, and without the "black metal" element attached. Without a full band, the members set out to start creating several songs for an extended demo.

But in 2003, after many failed attempts at completing the line-up, the members decided the band best be reserved as a side project so they may pursue other musical paths, and still try and record a demo. But, with more failed attempts at recording in studio later that year, the band simply decided to call it quits in early 2004.

In 2008 (after several years of inactivity), the only remaining original members John, Walid, and Riad decided that the time was ripe for recording and that the music was still good enough to be heard. It was also at this time that the name had changed from Gothmog to Ordum, seeing as it felt appropriate to start out fresh.

Walid S would cover vocal duties for the project, while Riad would handle drums, and John would take care of guitars. And with 'The Silex' studio up and running, recording went underway for the long-delayed demo.

Now almost complete, the extended demo will finally be available for a limited release by Spring 2011. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ordum">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
