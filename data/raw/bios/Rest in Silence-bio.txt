The beginning of the band goes back in November of 2007 where the band members met for the first time. In the beginning of 2008 the band made their musical concept and started to work on their first songs and their first demo recordings. 

Even though some members are also active in other projects, the band Rest in Silence began not only as a test, but as a band where all members have the same goal. 
The first demo tracks were made as taste to see in which direction the band is going and what its attentions are for the future. What concerns their musical direction it is not so hard to notice that the band decided to only follow their own instincts and express their way of dark melancholic and atmospheric sub-genre. 

In February 2009 the band met the producer Sami Hannu Koivisto, went to Biotech Audio Solutions studio and record their first Single CD titled Transmigration which includes three songs: The Call of Nemesis, Rest in Silence and Transmigration (Ode to Nothingness).  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rest+In+Silence">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
