From 1997 to 2006 (when he retired from live performance), Stunt Rock had built his career on countless spray-painted CDR's given away at shows in a drunken stupor. 

A total disregard for sequencing and obsession with samples gave way to a reputation as the new "punk rock" of the electronic scene in the Midwest.

He can also bounce a television off of his head like it's nothing.

He still releases music, but no more live shows. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Stunt+Rock">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
