Eturintama plays modern aggressive Finnish metal and has gigs as often as possible. The band is known of its energetic live acts and heavy partying after the shows.

Eturintama was formed by Jore Lehtinen (guitar) and Ville Vaittinen (vocals) at Puustock festival (Juva) in 2004 as a drunken whim of two young metalheads. After a couple of phone calls the band consisted of five members including Punk Luukkonen who still plays the bass. The other two are ex-members these days. After a few changes in the lineup Jakke Lehtinen (drums) and Jarkko Tiilikainen (guitar) established their position in the band. The current members are all from Imatra and Savonlinna.

Eturintama has done four studio demos of which the latest three can be downloaded from www.mikseri.net. All demos have been recorded, mixed and mastered in Imatra at Music-Bros studios. All lyrics are written by Ville Vaittinen and the songs are composed and arranged by Eturintama. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Eturintama">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
