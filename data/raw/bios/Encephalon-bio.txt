Synthetic Anthems for the Permanently Numb.

Fueled by club smashes "Rise" and "Responder" and with appearances on several high profile compilation albums (Septic, Dependence, Advanced Electronics) Encephalon has steadily accumulated a dedicated fanbase while making a unique impact on the global Electro/Synth/Industrial scene.

With heavy emphasis on lyrical content, composition, sound design, and live performance Encephalon is a spectacle of raw detached emotion and fractal-like intricacy.

2011 will finally see the release of Encephalon's long awaited debut album "The Transhuman Condition" a graceful and chaotic mechanical symphony that explores themes of isolation, futurism, and post human evolution while approaching rock opera levels of grandiosity.
