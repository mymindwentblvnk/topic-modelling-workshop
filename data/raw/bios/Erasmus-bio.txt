2. Erasmus was a metal band formed in 1995 by Chris Lundon and Todd Bridgeman. In 1998, their first demo CD, "Forged For Proof Eterne" was quickly put together and released for free distribution at Metalfest in Milwaukee. Soon after, in 1999, a cassette tape called "Alpha Demo '99" was recorded with an experimental take on the vocals and longer, more complex song structures. Some trading circles are known to have copies of this tape, although it was never intended for an official release. The guitars and drums from that demo tape were later re-recorded in 2002. Those recordings remained untouched until the winter of 2008, when they were completed and released as "Nth Fen." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Erasmus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
