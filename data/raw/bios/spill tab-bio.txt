spill tab – aka Claire Chicha – is a multi-talented wonder. The Los Angeles-based, French-Korean artist binned off her right-out-of-college stint as assistant tour manager for Gus Dapperton to pursue her own music; a seductive take on intimate bedroom pop that sees her thoroughly showing off her French roots combined with grimy late-night vibes. Just a handful of songs deep so far, her tracks bring together a multitude of influences for an experience that offers something new on every listen. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Spill+Tab">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
