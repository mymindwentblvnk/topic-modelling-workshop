Legion of Darkness was born in november 2001 from Flagellum and Lord Inferos.

In may 2002 the duet records its first demo "Hymns to Blasphemy", distribuited in a few copies and almost only in Palermo, Italy. The tracks included in the demo, remind a sound and an attitude tipically of the ninetees. 

The songs composed by Legion of Darkness, after the completion of the first demo, signs a radical change of style; the new songs are turned to a Pagan Black Metal influenced by groups like Behemoth of the first period and Graveland; the lyrics show a deeper meditation about the roots of our own being, that often unifies to more contemplative moments bound up with manifestations of Natural power and its effects on human disposition. 

These suggestions are made concrete in the omounimous demo of april 2003 ("Legion of Darkness") that is hailed with great enthusiasm by the national underground scene. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Legion+of+Darkness">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
