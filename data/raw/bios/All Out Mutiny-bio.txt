All Out Mutiny was founded in January 2015 and the first single, “The Hive” was released shortly after in March. This would lead to the anticipated “Whiskey Double” demo (June 2015) and was followed by their debut EP entitled “CURES: In Case Of Witches” which was first available on 9/4/15.

A multitude of Midwest shows and a growing online presence led the band to start another recording endeavor — AOM connected with Kelly Nunn (Underoath, Maylene and the Sons of Disaster) from Sound Source Studios in St. Petersburg FL to create the follow-up effort known as “Trade Routes” available worldwide now! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/All+Out+Mutiny">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
