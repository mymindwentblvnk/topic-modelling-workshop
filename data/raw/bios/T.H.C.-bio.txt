From 1996 to 1998 the band released one full length album, one E.P. and two 12 inch records. George left afterwards to work on solo projects.

In 1999, the band released one full length album together called Adagio. It consisted of a somber swirl of sexually-charged electronica.

T.H.C. gained some recognition after their music appeared in a couple of episodes of Buffy The Vampire Slayer (as well as its spin-off, Angel), playing the part of the fictional band Shy, of whom Veruca was the vocalist. George Sarah also appeared on the show as Shy's keyboard player.

Since disbanding the group to go solo in 1998, George Sarah has achieved spiraling fame and garnered huge critical acclaim for his unique brand of electronic chamber music.

3)T.H.C. (The Human Cell) was a crossover band from Nymburk, Czech Republic. Founded in may 1998 by Lukáš Pilař (guitar), Vladimir Petrov (drums), Vojta Říha (bass) and Maksi'Mike (vocal). All of them were experienced by different musical projects from the past.
Music of T.H.C. is based on hardcore with rap and shouted vocals and can be compared to Rage Against the Machine. In the winter of 1999 they recorded their first demo by themselves at home. Increased interest in the band led to more concert appearances in central Bohemia.
As time progressed the band started to implement more different styles to their hard music mix such as hip-hop and funk. They labeled their music as "east-side rap-cross". The lyrics in English draw the attention to social and political problems.
In december 2000 the band entered the Hostivař studio in Prague to record their first EP "Ready for Rebellion", released in january 2001 by themselves. More positive response to their new record led to more prestigious gigs. Years 2001 and 2002 were filled with many performances but in the beginning of 2003 an internal problems appeared and later that year the band dissolved or maybe actually transformed to Mindway.

Mike is now the leader of Mindway, Vojta plays with Radim Hladík's Blue Effect, Lukáš is doing sound engineering and Vladimir had his own musical projets.
