Giamon has crawled from the obscurity of rural France to bring you an album filled with haunting, aching riffs and an almost tribal approach to Black Metal. Each track is laden with deliberate, supine guitar melodies and spectral, grating vocals. Giamon strays from use of keyboards and synths in favor of nebulous guitars, creeping bass and purposeful, unadorned drumming. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Giamon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
