Having perfected their distinctive and inimitable musical expression along a path that spans their 10-year long career, Process of Guilt are today one of the main driving forces on the Portuguese underground. Delivering massively heavy riffs on top of a punishingly precise, quasi-industrial, rhythm section, the band possesses a unique intensity that attracts listeners from a broad spectrum of music genres. Vastly experienced when it comes to playing live – having even shared the stage with bands like Godflesh, Cult of Luna or Napalm Death – their performances are pure displays of ferocity that leave no one indifferent. With the release of their third full length «FÆMIN», in 2012, Process of Guilt finally took the long deserved leap to international recognition and acclaim – the album granted them two headlining European tours and a spot at the 2013 edition of Roadburn Festival in Tilburg, where they played to a full and enthusiastic crowd at the legendary Green Room.

Process of Guilt’s latest release - 12” Split with Rorcal - is comprised of “Liar”, one piece divided in 3 movements (I, II and III), featuring the astonishing contribution of Kernal (the drone/noise/ambient project of Rorcal’s guitar player JP). This 18 minutes of new music show Process of Guilt evolving once again, capturing the organic and industrial vibes already present in «FÆMIN» and developing them further into building an hypnotic beast of mammoth proportions.
