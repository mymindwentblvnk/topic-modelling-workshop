In 1994, Pete and Jeff moved to Baltimore to find like-minded musicians. Within a year, Kurgan’s Bane had formed and played numerous shows. In early 1997, the band was fortunate to find Luis available and he immediately joined. His playing complemented that of their own and his writing added a new dimension to their sound. They found a new singer soon after.
In early 1998, Kurgan’s Bane released their first CD, Search from Sea to Sea. It received sparse, yet international, radio airplay and earned positive international reviews. A few months later, the Bane again found themselves without a singer. They could not immediately find anyone to fit their style and their demands so, in the interim of the next year, they played all-instrumental shows.
In the summer of 1999, Lisa became the new singer after auditioning for only 15 minutes. She had her first performance with the band 10 days later. In January of 2000, the band went back into the studio to record The Future Lies Broken, which was released throughout Europe by the Swedish independent label Record Heaven. Future received international airplay and some great reviews. Throughout 2001 and 2002, the Bane played numerous shows on the east coast to support the CD.
Unfortunately, starting in 2002, outside projects and various "medical procedures" sidelined the band for a number of months. And in September of 2003, Hurricane Isabel swept through Baltimore, bringing three feet of water into the “Bane” house. It took several months to get things squared away.
The band finished mixing their newest CD, "Camouflaged In Static," in the summer of 2005. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kurgan%27s+Bane">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
