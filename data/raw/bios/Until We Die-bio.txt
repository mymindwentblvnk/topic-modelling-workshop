Niko created the idea for "Until We Die" in March, 2010. He was a young guitarist, but didnÂ´t have the equipment to record anything, so he collected ideas.
After being the vocalist and guitarist of multiple bands, he decided that he wanted to record his own music, so he went along and recorded multiple demo songs in his self build homestudio with nothing but his laptop and equipment. He started learning how to record, mix, master and produce full songs by himself, and gained knowledge very quickly.
Two years later he created the page for his project called "Until We Die" in March, 2015 and started spreading the word about his music.
Since then, he started releasing all of his recorded songs for the people in the metal scene that love melodic, inspiring, thoughtful, yet heavy music.
After releasing the 2015 demo people showed him support immediately. He went along and released an EP called "A World In Flames" in April, 2016. The EP was physically printed by the label "Mid West Brutality" and sold out the next day they were online.
Niko started recording the debut album "Before the Decay of Time" before releasing the EP consisting of older tracks in 2016. The highly anticipated album was released November 2016 in cooperation with Chugcore. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Until+We+Die">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
