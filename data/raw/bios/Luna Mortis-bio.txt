Luna Mortis is an American metal band from Madison, Wisconsin, formed in 2004.

At once melodic and abrasive, technical and engaging, the female-fronted quintet blurs genre lines and transcends convention, carving a niche all their own, providing a new and powerful voice in metal. Since the solidification of their lineup in 2006, the band has consistently set a very high standard for live performance in their native Midwest, delivering precise renderings of their recorded material with unbridled intensity. The strength of the band's live show has allowed them opening spots for such acts as Megadeth, Nevermore, Dream Theater, Children of Bodom, and many more.

Luna Mortis released its debut and only full-length album to date, entitled ' The Absence ' on February 10th, 2009 via Century Media. They have also released two EPs, under the band's former name The Ottoman Empire, 'Way of the Blade' (2006) and The Answer: Does Not Exist (2008).

In February 2010, guitarist Brian Koenig released a statement announcing that the band would dissolve. About three years later, in 2013, all five members from 'The Absence', vocalist Mary Zimmer, guitarists Brian Koenig and Cory Scheider, bassist Jacob Bare and drummer Erik Madsen announced plans to reunite for festival appearances and the release of new music.
