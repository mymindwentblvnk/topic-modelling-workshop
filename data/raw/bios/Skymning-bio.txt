There's three bands with the name Skymning:

1. Skymning was formed in late 1996 by Kim (R.I.P.) - vocals, Johannes - guitar, Christian - guitar, Sebastian - bass and Ola - Drums. In 1997 Christian left the band and Robert replaced him. They went to Los Angered Recordings and recorded a demotape called "At the fields of Megiddo" with producer Andy LaRoque (King Diamond) in early 1998 and signed a record deal with Invasion Records (Germany) and went back to Los Angered to record their debut album "Stormchoirs" in december that same year. "Stormchoirs" was released January 1999 in Europe and Japan. After that Kim left the band and Robert took the mic aswell. Later that year Invasion Records collapsed and Skymning stood without a label with a new album to record. So they went back to Los Angered and recorded a demo named "Demo-99" to sent to some labels. It was not released. Things did not work out the way they planned and Sebastian left the band.
After a break they started working on a new album heading in a different direction towards a more industrial sound. They signed with Blackend Records (UK) and Ola's brother Stefan (ex. Inverted, Immersed in Blood") joined on the bass. They went to StudioMega and producer Chistian Silver in autumn 2001 and recorded "Artificial Supernova" which was released in beginning of 2002. In summer 2003 they went back to StudioMega and recorded their third album called "Machina Genova" but it was not released until April 2004. In the beginnng of 2005 Erik Ljungkvist (ex. Arise) joined Skymning as a vocalist. The band has been inactive since summer 2005.
