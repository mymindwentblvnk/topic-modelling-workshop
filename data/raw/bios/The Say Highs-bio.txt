The Say Highs have spent the last two years building their own studio and writing new material and are now returning to the stage in 2011. With a wonderful new collection of songs that promise to take you on an inspiring journey, gently infused with echoes of Americana, folk, pop and a smattering of 60s legends, the band have definitely gone back to their roots. This promising Berlin band consisting of Guido Kreutzmueller, Dave McGinty, Ramin Bijan, Adrian Krok and Leo Auri guarantee to deliver heart-rending moments enveloped in sublime vocal harmonies. Which all just goes to show that “yes” big cities can indeed produce first-rate folk! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Say+Highs">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
