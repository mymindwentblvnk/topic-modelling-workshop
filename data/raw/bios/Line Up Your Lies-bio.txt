Line up your lies is a three piece grind band from Socal.Formed in 2000 to just jam and have fun grinding in the garage.Eventually LUYL put out a self released seven inch(Failure in the mirror.2005 ),A full length(At times of peace prepare for war.2008)and a split seven inch with Los Angeles grinders BrucexCampbell(Gore vs. War!2011).The trio did go on tour with Japan's very own World Downfall in 2006.Original members were Don Barber Kyle Shimek and Brent Ventimiglia.Now the band is made up of Founding members Don Barber and Brent Ventimiglia with newest addition and longest lasting bassist Giovanni Trujillo.The grinders continue to write music that continually evolves.From the early days of playing garage tunes for fun.To the present day blasting mayhem that there fans cant get enough of!
