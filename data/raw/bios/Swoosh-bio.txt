DJ Swoosh (FIN)

Swoosh a.k.a. Tero Viento attended the first Finnish warehouse parties of the early 90s and has been obsessed with techno culture ever since. Many of the early genres of electronic dance music such as acid, rave, hardcore and drum’n’bass have influenced his current selection of tunes. Especially the harder, harsher side of dance music appealed to him, and albums from numerous different genres piled up in his collection over the years. During the late 90s he also began to develop a gradually growing interest in spinning records.

The final spark for DJ work sprang from meeting E-NRG, (a.k.a. Ari Virtanen) and a group called Carbon Based. Some years later, in the early 2000s, he started considering a more serious DJ career.

Nowadays Swoosh plays energetic Hard Trance, composing his sets of fresh and good-humoured sounds, uplifting melodies, rolling basslines and sheer energy. He enjoys seeking new artists and bringing their music forward in the Finnish hard dance scene.

Swoosh has played numerous gigs in various underground events, but has also performed at clubs and large events such as Endless Summer Party, SÄDE, FURY and FINRG Tour.
He has been closely following and acting as a background support in the operation of his friends’ label FINRG Records, and today he plays as a FINRG DJ.

Besides just deejaying DJ Swoosh is also managing FINRG Agency with Sergei Shkuroff and furthermore he is a part of the infamous STUTTGART KICKERS crew which has become widely known for throwing some of the most outrageous underground parties in Finland.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Swoosh">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
