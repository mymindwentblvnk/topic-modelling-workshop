2) Seed of Pain (Lucerne, Switzerland, Europa) started out as a hardcore/punk band in 2007. Main influences back then were early 90ies bands such as Burn, Inside Out or more obscure groups like Atlas Shrugged and MindOverMatter. After a self-released demo, the band recorded a one-sided 12" to be released on the now defunct german label Let it Ride Records. The release was called "Power, Corruption and Lies" and already showed the band's love for the new wave and post-punk music. After several other mini-releases, Seed of Pain recorded their debut album "Blindfolded & Doomed" in the summer of 2009.

The music's evolved since the first releases, heading into a darker, heavier direction. The band named Neurosis, Swans as well as Einst√ºrzende Neubauten as big influences for their latest output. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Seed+of+Pain">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
