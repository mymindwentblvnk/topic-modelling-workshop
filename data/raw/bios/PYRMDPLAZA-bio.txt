PYRMDPLAZA is currently attending the University of Wales and is studying 'Creative Sound and Music'. He uses Ableton but started off with FLStudio. PYRMD started making music about 6-7 years ago and created privately for many years until the beginning of this year when he realized that he wanted to showcase his music. He definitely made the right choice otherwise we wouldn't be here at this very moment. Goes to show you how important social media is and how simply hitting "upload" can change your whole life by connecting with the world. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/PYRMDPLAZA">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
