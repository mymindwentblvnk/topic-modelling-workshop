Conscience is the name of more than one artist:
1) French prog/metal band
2) German synthpop Band
3) Canadian rapper
4) GOON TRAX
5) Christian artist

1) Conscience is a French metal band which has sets its musical direction in mid-2001. Conscience spent a lot of time on stage, thus earning a well-deserved reputation as an engaging band which performance live you can always count on. This reputation led them to open for Nightwish in front of an audience of 6500, even before the release of their first album.

The band engages in a series of concerts in several towns throughout France (alongside Sonata Arctica, Dead Soul Tribe, Anathema, Epica, A.C.T, Arena,...).

Conscience is composed of Nicolas Duc-Dudon (drums and percussions, Matthieu Gerbin (guitar and lead vocals), Hervé Pfeiffer (guitar and vocals), Cyril Stauder (bass and vocals), and Gérald Tanty (keyboard and sampling).

The influences of the members of Conscience are very diverse, but find a common ground in Progressive Metal, by melting together all types of music and all types of musical construction. It finds inspiration in the poems of Nicolas Moulard, a young French author who has been living in the United States for some years. His writing determines moods, atmospheres and emotions which are found within the songs.

Conscience is often compared to Pain Of Salvation, Dream Theater, Vanden Plas or Queensrÿche.
