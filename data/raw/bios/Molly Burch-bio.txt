Molly Burch is an American singer-songwriter based in Austin, TX. When on tour, she is the lead vocalist and writer backed by four musicians. She and her band have toured with Sallie Ford. Burch studied jazz vocal performance in college and gravitated towards vocalists such as Nina Simone and Billie Holiday.

Burch's voice takes cues from old timers like Dusty Springfield and Patsy Cline to create throaty mountains and valleys of sound. It's retro country and soul in the best way. Growing up in Los Angeles with a writer/producer father and a casting director mother, Burch's childhood was filled with old Hollywood musicals and the sounds of Patsy Cline, Billie Holiday and Nina Simone. After finding her voice in adolescence, Burch packed up for the University of North Carolina in Asheville to study Jazz Vocal Performance.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Molly+Burch">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
