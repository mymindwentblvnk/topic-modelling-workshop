There are several artists and bands called Moe. 

1. The Norwegian band MoE is known for mixing their minimalistic compositions with alternative and experimental approaches that fails to fit in the rock genre. With countless collaborations with artist such as Keiji Haino, Pain Jerk, Lasse Marhaug, Okkyung Lee and many others, exceeding the borders of rock and noise, MoE seeks the absolute presence in the execution of the music. Loud and violently, they molest their instruments and brings the listener closer to a healthy insanity. MoE's palette is still composed of a multitude of expressions which catalyses into a highly charged and viscid sound. Executed with a profound presence, spontaneous energy and dedication. Many influences have been pointed out, and descriptions are sometimes close to contradictory; "MoE is like Jesus Lizard/Scratch Acid meets Napalm Death dressed up like very early Swans", meaning MoE don't care about genres.

2. Moe (aka Mohammed Alazzawie, born November 29, 1984) is a Swedish pop singer. He released his so far only album "My World" in 2002. Three singles were released from the album: "Backstabber", "Side by Side" and "Stop".
