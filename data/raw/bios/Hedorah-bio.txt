There are 2 artists called Hedorah

Bandcamp: http://hedorahhighonsmog.bandcamp.com/

1)  Hedorah was a sludge-spewing death metal band from Detroit, Michigan that brings a unique hallucinatory brand of morbid metal to the Michigan underground. Total wall of sound skullduggery that is equal parts noisey anti-music assault as it is boneheaded primitive metal.

2) An Industrial noise / doom metal / drone project consisting of James Keeler (Wilt) and Dan Hall. Collected demos released on the Hedorah "Collection" CD-r on Crucial Bliss (Crucial Blast sublabel). Recommended for fans of Black Mayonnaise, Nadja, Gnaw Their Tongues, Moss, etc
