Pestnebel was founded in 2002 by Tairach (guitars, vocals) and Nebeltroll (percussion, keyboard) in Göttingen to celebrate cold, raw Black Metal. Tairach was also the guitarist and founder of the Black Metal band Fiend (ger), that is coming from Göttingen, too.

After three albums in the original instrumentation, Nebeltroll was replaced with Malthökk (Ewiges Reich , Fiend (ger), Ulfsdalir) on the percussion. Moreover, the line-up was enhanced by Schargaz (Hetaeria) on the rhythm guitar and Wyrm on bass.  This line-up completed the works on the upcoming album "Durch Sphären endloser Dunkelheit", which is planned to be re released within the near future.
