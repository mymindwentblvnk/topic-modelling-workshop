Hercyn was conceived in Autumn of 2010 between Mike D. and Ernest W. as a private folk music conclave that evolved into a full band project. As a two piece acoustic group, Hercyn performed an alternative version of their epic Magda while they were finishing up their studio work for the same song. Tony S., who recorded and mixed the first release, took up bass after the recording was finished and as of August of 2013, Mike Toscarelli joined on drums to complete the lineup. Currently, Hercyn released the first official recording of 'Magda' on September 23rd of 2013. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hercyn">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
