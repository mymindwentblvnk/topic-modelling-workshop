$ilverdollar is a heavy/power metal band from Sweden. $ilverdollar began as a cover band in 1995, but after 6 years and 300 gigs the members grew tired of the constant touring. This lead to them recording a cover album, and afterwards, their own material. They are currently signed with Shark Records

The line-up currently consists of: vocalist Esa Englund, guitarist Ola Berg, bassist Fredrik Hall, and drummer Mats Hjerp. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/$ilverdollar">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
