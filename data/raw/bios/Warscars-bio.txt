Warscars is often seen as a Gronibard-members’ side-project because it shares most of its line-up with the aforementioned band. But what most people don’t know is that Warscars exists for as long as Gronibard does as before Gronibard became a, hum, “serious” band, the guys had many bands in the same time. Gronibard was one, Warscars an other.

Warscars is all what Gronibard is not: old-school, “roots”, totally based on the aggression, the fast riffing and screaming vocals… But it’s also all that Gronibard is: a very good production (same studio), great musicians (among which CM of Gronibard / Sylvester Staline and GD of Gronibard, ex-Aborted).

The band released its debut MCD, “Killing rate: complete” (Bones Brigade records) on ‘03 and a split CD with Leng Tch’e, still for Bones Brigade, on late ‘06.

Since the guys’ will to put Gronibard as their priority as of ‘07 and the loss of singer AV (who left for personal reason, but still plays in Gronibard), Warscars is quite “on hold”, but not dead for sure! Expect to hear more from them in the future! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Warscars">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
