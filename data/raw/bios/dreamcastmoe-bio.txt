dreamcastmoe is a singer, songwriter, producer and life long resident of Washington DC, formally the Chocolate City. Traversing across R&B, funk, soul, jazz and hip-hop, Bryant slickly moves between styles and tones. This ability to twist and turn in different directions - yet remain stylistically coherent - can be traced to his home city of DC and the makeup of the neighbourhoods.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/dreamcastmoe">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
