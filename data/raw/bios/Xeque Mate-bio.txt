Portuguese Heavy Metal band formed in 1981. 

Released their debut album, "Em Nome Do Pai, Do Filho, e do Rock'n'Roll" in 1985, which becomes a commercial failure due to lack of promotion by their label. Band stagnates and dies in 1989.

Members reunite in 2016 to record a new album, titled "Ã†ternum Testamentum". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Xeque+Mate">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
