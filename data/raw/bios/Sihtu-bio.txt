SIHTU is a band of the southwest of France, and was born late in the year 2007 under the name of Schizophrenia, with the desire to produce a sink sound ,and powerful at once, all this thanks to a very calculated rhythm section, heavy and technical riffs!

After some workweeks, the evolution of the band, consisted of experimented musicians, was impressive, and they decide to propose their universe live, to be able to communicate their ideas and all their energy to the public.

In a few months, after a series of concerts which were more and more waited, SIHTU knew how to show its capacities to explode there live, by delivering massive and powerful sounds, with a worked set and indeed in place.

Pushed by these very encouraging start, the band records in summer 2009 its first album, V.I.T.R.I.O.L. completely autoproduced, this one gives a global vision of the band today allying efficiency and musical research. Playing the hard pieces (Question of time, No. use for a brain) with more epic and tortured titles ( V.I.T.R.I.O.L).

SIHTU continues to work its set to defend this first album as it is necessary, and already the ideas fuse for news composition .

Today, worried of finding its place in the landscape of the French metal, the band looks for a label to promote the album with efficiency and obviously is inclined to defend its titles on all the stages of France <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/SIHTU">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
