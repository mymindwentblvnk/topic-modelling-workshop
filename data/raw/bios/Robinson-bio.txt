There are (at least) two artists that use the name Robinson:

1) Robinson (born Anna Robinson in 1996/1997) is an indie-pop singer-songwriter from New Zealand.  Robinson released her first single "Don't You Forget About Me" in 2017. Her song "Nothing to Regret" reached the top 40 in Australia and New Zealand in 2018. She is based in Nelson, New Zealand.

2) Robinson is a mathcore band from Ohio. They play a chaotic version of epic, progressive, blast-beat mathcore, complete with riffs and shrill, intense screams. The band have released many demos including the more wide known 7 Song Demo as well as their first full-length record, "The Great City" on Oklahoma-based label Debello Recordings. When long time guitarist left to join From A Second Story Window, the band pretty much vanished. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Robinson">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
