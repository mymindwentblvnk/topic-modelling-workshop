Bladecatcher is a project by two finnish guys, Olli and Konsta. They started at 08, combining their views of metal, and starting to make songs with GP. The project got it's name, Bladecatcher, after thinking of possible awesome names. Their genre was from the beginning progressive metal, but as the songs evolved, they became more complicated and involved with polyrhythms. For now Olli plays guitar and growls, as Konsta handles the guitar, bass and programming. Bladecatcher is looking for a drummer, a bass player, and possibly a vocalist from Tampere/Kangasala - area. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bladecatcher">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
