Kamron Ford (born in January 17, 2004), better known by his stage name YSN Flow is an American rapper from Ohio. His first mixtape was going to be the tape titled "Guap Infection" but was scrapped. Now, YSN Flow enters the next phase of his career with his debut mixtape “FLOW $ZN.

Harmonizing hip-hop sensation YSN Flow has lived many lives within his sixteen years. Flow first garnered praise with his track “Want Beef?”. Growing up, Flow didn’t find hip-hop, rather hip-hop found him. One day he was walking home from school with some friends and started play-harmonizing the hook to hip-hop tracks. By boosting a pair of speakers from Target, grabbing a Snowball microphone from Target, and using his mom’s laptop, Flow went into his bedroom closet, put a winter glove on his new mic and started cutting tracks at just 13 years old.

His songs were raw, yet detailed, discussing the world around him in the Cleveland streets as seen through the eyes of a teenager. He started pushing his music and “Want Beef?” broke through cracking 15M+ streams on YouTube. More tracks followed by the millions, from “Want Beef? 2.0” to “Illegal Guns”, “OH OKAY!” and “Dirt!” Flow later signed a deal with Republic Records.

FLOW $ZN brings a new energy to YSN Flow’s growing career. While there’s still gritty tales, tracks like “Prescription” use a narcotic metaphor to double as pickup line for the ladies. Songs like “Bad Vibe” with Lil Tjay tackle Flow’s mature intuition that only comes from living a teenage life in the fast line. The YSN in his name reflects his crew “Young Successful Navigation”, and it’s clear that Flow is navigating straight to the top. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/YSN+Flow">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
