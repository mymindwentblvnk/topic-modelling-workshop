"Quite an unusual name, but the music is surprisingly cool and unconventional. The trio’s delivers a mixture of Stoner Rock and Doom Metal , enriched with a lot of groove and underground Rock. But these are just clues to describe what these kids are all about, cause overall they are way too complex and independent in their sound. 

Exempt from the title track “Eye Of Ra” they avoid lengthening the songs unnecessarily and get straight to the point. In addition, there are broad instrumental-parts and a great diversity. The guitars are raw and heavy, the drums pound and the harsh vocals are a conclusive plus as well. 

I also like the production of the record. It was recorded in the band’s rehearsal room, but nevertheless, they managed to mix a decent sound, which persuades with it’s comforting and raw character. We are not dealing with cheap rehearsal sound here – so, if you want to search beyond common paths, this band from Hongkong is a safe bet."
