Double Square started as a side project in September of 2004 of the guitarist "Costas Papadopoulos" (Karma Violens,Verdict Denied), the bassist "Costas Tasakos" (x-Verdict Denied), "Fotis Benardo" (Septic Fesh, x-Nightrage) behind the drums and "Steve Venardo" (Valet Parn) on vocals. Each member alone has vast knowledge and experience of music over a decade.

We took the decision to make an American style death metal band. The heavy detune riffing laying upon a metal groovy drum 'n' bass lines gives the ultimate character of the band. Blasting riffing mid and up tempo blended together with hardcore drumming and groovy bass lines.

Nowadays the band entered the studio to record the first full length album...The album produced by Fotis Benardo at "Devasoundz Studios" and the final mix and mastering was made at "Tico Tico Studios" in Finland. This is the original line up and "The Hive" is the debut album.
