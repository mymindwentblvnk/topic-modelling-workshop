In the summer of 2006 a local, young and fairly well known Metal band by the name of To the Grave changed their identity to The Horror Cast. In deceiving their former self the band strived to improve and evolve, surpassing the boundaries of generic music along the way and coming up with a sound that is with the help of their influences entirely their own. A sound that they like to refer to as Horror Metal. An amalgamation of technical, melodic, progressive Death Metal and horror movie inspired subject matter. However, the horror does not end with the lyrics nor does it begin. It is also an attribute of the actual music. The band play frighteningly evil sounding riffs, enough to make the bloodthirsty cringe. Through their energetic and chaotic live performance, THC have garnered a dedicated fan base and continue to win over Metal supporters and even the unconverted show after show. Now with the release of their highly anticipated debut EP titled “Cities of Deception,” the creatures that make up The Horror Cast is set to bludgeon a furious dent in the South African Metal scene and spread the horror all over the country. Keep a watchful eye on these monsters.
