Eyes Of The Sun was conceived in early 2007 by bassist/vocalist Jeff Blanchard, the former frontman for the late project Redshift Desert. Long time friends Miguel De Jesus Jr. (guitarist and founding member of Ashes Within) joined the ranks with Jeff a few months later. The music of Eyes Of The Sun itself is intended to create a range of emotions for the listener that we ourselves experience and extract from. To draw from the memories of one's life. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Eyes+of+The+Sun">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
