Formed in late 2001, Omegalord exploded onto the music scene with one goal in mind - to create a hard rock revolution in the Philadelphia area and beyond. After their formation, the band set out writing original, heavy, hook driven songs. They began playing live performances in October of 2002.

Omegalordâ€™s lineup is comprised of seasoned musicians that have played in various known bands over the course of their musical careers. Their live show is a high energy spectacle to behold, and they have already shared the stage with such great bands as Anthrax, Overkill, Orange Goblin, Alabama Thunderpussy, Dixie Witch, Bad Wizard, Spaceseed, Speedealer, Wooly Mammoth, October 31, Stinking Lizaveta, Mensrea, Insatanity, and Mortal Decay.

Omegalord released their first CD in December 2002, a five song release which established the bandâ€™s presence and style, and was well received by the local music community. The band continued playing live shows on the east coast, always raising the bar of intensity and showmanship.

Their second CD was released in early 2004. A four song offering, this disc redefined the bandâ€™s sound and showed a tremendous progression in the bandâ€™s musicianship and song writing. It received rave reviews all over the heavy music scene in both America and abroad.

Released in March of 2005, Omegalordâ€™s debut full length album, entitled â€œHammer Downâ€ was recorded at the world famous Slave Pit, the studios of the legendary band GWAR. It was engineered by Cory Smoot, a.k.a. Flattus Maximus. With this impressive and unique 10 song release, they hope to bring their brand of heavy music to fans across the world.
