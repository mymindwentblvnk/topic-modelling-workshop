Gimli Balrog was formed in 1998 by Augrath, Calenoz and Lord Köttkvarn. The band released the old school black metal demo "Smålands Mörka Skogsland", after which Lord Köttkvarn died in a tragic accident. Augrath and Calenoz decided to put the band on hold, but returned in 2007 with the demo "Tartari Culina". This recording had a more modern sound and the band was also joined by the singer Persephone.
Gimli Balrog released the third demo, "Djävulens Gästabud" in December 2009. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gimli+Balrog">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
