Endless Dismal Moan (2001 - 2008) was a mesmerizing Necro Black Metal band from Japan, created by its sole member, Chaos9 (aka TAKUYA TSUTSUI). During the time of its existence, EDM played several shows around Japan, and released three albums; Endless Dismal Moan (2004), Lord of Nightmare (2006), and Ruin (2007). (with guitarist and friend Lydian6 playing on the debut album alongside Chaos9). Additionally, some demos were released in 2001, 2002, and 2004, but they are not, however,  widely available due to the fact that they were all self released.

 On June 25, 2008 EDM was put to rest when Chaos9 ended his life by his own hands.

 Late January of 2010 it was announced that the latest and last full length of Endless Dismal Moan was available- titled "Curse of Underground", regarded as posthumous work of Chaos9.  It contains 7 new tracks and was released by Sabbathid Records. The label has stressed that it is not a collection of "unreleased" material or a best of collection, but rather a genuine full length.
