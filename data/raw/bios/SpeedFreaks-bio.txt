The SPEED FREAKS were part of the early Milwaukee basement punk/hardcore scene. 
Forming in the Summer of 1984 and staying active throughout the next six years. 
The band self-released 'FREAKSHOW' in 1988 and quietly ceased to be in the Summer of 1992. 
Fast forward to Spring 2007, SPEED FREAKS reunite to party with old and new friends.
