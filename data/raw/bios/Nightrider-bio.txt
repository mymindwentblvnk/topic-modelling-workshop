NIGHTRIDER (Nashua NH 1980-current) was born out of 4 teenage friends shared passion for heavy metal and rock music. From humble beginnings of playing "air" guitars and headbanging to our favorite AC/DC and Priest tunes to composing some vintage kick ass rock originals, NIGHTRIDER proved that hard work and love of hard rock could make for a formidable, talented, tight rock group. Although starting off learning cover tunes, NIGHTRIDER almost immediately starting writing original music and gaining a following in the process. Simple straight ahead rockers like "Open Road" and the title track "Nightrider" became fan favorites. As the writing matured thus were born killer classic tracks like "Nightmare" and "Heart Has Died". The music of Nightrider was the soundtrack of our coming of age. Four Friends living out our fantasies and alter egos through rock and roll music. Little did we realize at the time the profound influence we would have on the local music scene as Nightrider spawned numerous bands who were mere kids who would come to our rehearsals to watch the action. Our rehearsals were more like full blown concerts with full Lights and PA and lots of beer! We partied hard and rocked harder in a town known more for its "deadheads" than headbangers. Not to be deterred NIGHTRIDER threw down the gauntlet for other bands to aspire to. So Welcome to the next chapter of NIGHTRIDER-NH's founding fathers of hard rock and metal- musical journey!
