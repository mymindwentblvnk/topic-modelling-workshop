The Killigans are a six piece “folk-punk” band from Lincoln, NE, USA. The Killigans “sound” combines the diverse musicals tastes of the bands members; fusing Punk Rock, Folk, Country and Western, Celtic, European folk, Americana, and other types of music into an upbeat, foot-stomping, beer-raising party. Lyrically, the songs range from classic storytelling to rebel songs to ballads to middle class anthems. The Killigans are a band who thrive on live performance and crowd interaction.

The Killigans formed in late 2004 and have gone through several personnel and instrumentation changes. The band has always strived to create a better band dynamic both on and off the stage. The core members include Brad Hoffman on vocals, the three Nebesniak brothers, and Ben Swift on drums.
