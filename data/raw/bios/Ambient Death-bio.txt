Ambient Death blends the finer points of dark sinister death and black metal with some amazing intricate and ambient interludes. The drumming is spectacular and the overall theme of this bands EP is darkness and evil, casting an eerie mood on proceedings. It's catchy and fun as well as heavy and relentless, but the ambient style woven into the overall sound really gives it that extra kick. You'll enjoy this, I certainly did.
