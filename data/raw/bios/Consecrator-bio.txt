Consecrator was formed in late 1989 by James Chavez, Ashley Lawhon, Glenn Johnson and Steve Tidwell. They were a band called HIT AND RUN which were playing original's and cover songs from many popular heavy metal bands. Consecrator went through two names changes before establishing its current name, they tried Seventh Angel but found it was taken, then they tried Sacrament which we also found had been taken. After solving the name problem they rehearsed for about six months before hitting the local music scene starting off with a local Battle of The Bands in which they surprised everyone and ended up winning. By mid 1990 they had written many songs and were ready to attempt recording their first demo the self titled CONSECRATOR. 

The band split up in 1993 and reformed in 2004.
