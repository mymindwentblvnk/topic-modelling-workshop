Under Silence performs Metal with an epic background.

Founded in Bilbao, in summer 2009, from the ashes of Metal Band Sugaar by Rober Bruña (vocalist), Ibon San Vicente (Guitarist) and Gonzalo Libano (Drums). 

Under Silence started the record of Memories Lost In Time in early September 2009 at Chromaticity Studios (produced by Alex De Benito & Pedro Monge). The CD compiles re-designed songs from Sugaar era plus brand-new songs composed throughout 2009. During CD’s production, Ruben Angulo (formerly guitarist of Sugaar) helped the band to record the rhythm guitar tracks. 

In January 2010 the band acquired new guitarist (Aitor López) who helped during the recording last stage. 

In March 2010 the band ended the record process of the eigth tracks of Memories Lost In Time. MLIT was finally released in November 2010. 

In December 2010 acquired new bass player (Alvaro Aranda).
