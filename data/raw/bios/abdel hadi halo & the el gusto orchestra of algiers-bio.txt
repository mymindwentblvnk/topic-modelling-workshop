This Algerian chaabi ensemble have drawn inevitable comparisons to the Buena Vista Social Club, which, given the story, are somewhat valid. Chaabi (an Arabic word meaning 'for the people') was a once vibrant and very popular music in Northern Africa, in music schools, parties and bars of occupied, post-WWII Algeria, where its Spanish, Middle Eastern and North African lineage infused with the Mediterranean soundtrack of that era â€” jazz, snatches of tango, a little boogie-woogie.

The orchestra began when pianist Abdel Hadi Halo tracked down graduates (all aged 60 to 90) of his chaabi pioneer father El Hadj El Anka's music school, and brought them together in Algiers. Produced by Damon Albarn, Abdel Hadi Halo & the El Gusto Orchestra of Algiers is a subtle and seamless blend of North African, French, Andalucian, and Latin American influences. Rhythm reigns supreme, with the small army of oud, qanun, bendir and derbouka meshing with accordion, violins, flute, and, of course, piano as various singers lay bare their souls.
