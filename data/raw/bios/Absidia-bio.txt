There are two bands by the name of Absidia. One is from Germany and the other one from Russia. The bands play completely different genres and styles and should not be confused with each other. Both bands have split up.

-Absidia (Ger) - is a death metal/hardcore band which was originally formed in 1998 under the name Countless. They later changed their name to Absidia. They released one demo, two split albums and one full-length (2001) called Written in Minor Key. The band split up in 2003.

-Absidia (Rus) - is a symphonic black metal band from Russia. The band was formed in the late 1990s. They play a very melodic/symphonic style of black metal and make much use of keyboards, melodic guitar riffs & mid tempo drumming and even some female vocals. Before splitting up, they released one full-length album (2000) called Triumphal Way of Eternal Gods.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Absidia">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
