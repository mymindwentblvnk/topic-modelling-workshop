Scarlet Storm is a female fronted symphonic gothic metal duo hailing from the United Kingdom. Formed in 2008 by Khepri and Petra, they meld classical symphonic orchestration with middle eastern flavoured heavy metal guitars. Powerful, dynamic and beautiful female vocals grace over the dark, brooding music.
