Blood-Stained
Melodic death metal / thrash metal from Finland

Expressing themselves through melodic death metal, BLOOD-STAINED was found during the year 2000 by the guitarist Tero Luukkonen and drummer Ville Juvonen. Hardly any progress was made until the autumn 2002 due to a simple reason of lacking members. In August ´02 the second guitarist Jari Solismaa and bassist Petteri Kattainen joined in. After this a few different vocalists were tried out, until the vocalist Riku Meriläinen was found. However, in April 2003 he decided to split ways with the band and was replaced by Mikko Kylmälä. The first live show ever was performed February 2004. The debut 4-song promo cd "Chaotics_v1.0" was released June 2004. In september '04 another change in the line-up was made, as the vocalist Mikko Kylmälä was unable to continue in the band. Fortunately the new vocalist Oskari Kettinen was found soon to complete the line-up. In spring 2006, a radical change in the line-up occurred. Due to different issues between band members, vocalist Kettinen and bassist Kattainen were separated from Blood-stained. After that the band was put on hold for several months, but luckily soon enough bassist Eetu Blomqvist and vocalist Antti Ström were found to join the band. At the moment new material is on its way.
