1. Dram (stylized as d r a m) is a Serbian Indie Pop-rock/Synthpop group from Belgrade, founded in 2017. They have released two albums so far: Nećemo Promeniti Svet (2019) and (Previše Svega (2022). 

2. Rapper, singer, and producer Dram (also known as D.R.A.M., which stands for "Does. Real. Ass. Music.") is best known for his 2016 summer hit "Broccoli." Born Shelley Marshaun Massenburg-Smith in Germany, the Virginia-based artist released his debut mixtape, #1 Epic Summer, in 2014. It featured the single "Cha Cha," a club-worthy cut that was a regional hit. In 2015, he broke on a national scale when Cleveland R&B radio station Z 107.9 FM began playing the cut as their "weekend warmer," a campaign that eventually reached Beyoncé, who shared a video of her own version of the track. With Queen B's co-sign, "Cha Cha" was re-released that year while #1 Epic reappeared as an EP. Following the increased exposure brought on by "Cha Cha"'s success, D.R.A.M. released another mixtape, the aptly titled Gahdamn! in October 2015. Months later, he scored a hit with the Lil' Yachty-assisted "Broccoli." The track went gold and had risen into the Billboard Top 40 by the time summer rolled around in 2016. That October, D.R.A.M. issued his debut LP, Big Baby D.R.A.M. Debuting in the Top 20, the effort included "Broccoli," as well as guest appearances by Erykah Badu and Young Thug. The collaborations continued in early 2017 with the single "Gilligan," which featured A$AP Rocky and Juicy J, and a guest spot on the "Girl at Coachella" single by Matoma. ~ David Jeffries & Neil Z.
