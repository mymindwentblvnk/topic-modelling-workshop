We are a heavy metal band. Formed in 2006, broke up in mid '07 and reformed in 2008. A concept album will be released soon.

Our purpose is to obey the command given to the church in Sardis (Revelation 3:2 -- "Wake up! Strengthen what remains and is about to die, for I have not found your deeds complete in the sight of my God."). We believe it is time to wake up. Our goal is to help provide the tools and inspiration to awaken this generation through our music, shows, and lyrics.
