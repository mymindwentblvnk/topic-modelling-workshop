1) Electric Chair from Split/Trogir, Croatia:

The band was founded by Leo Hajder and Vinko Vukorepa in June of 2005 in Split, Croatia. After a while, Tonci Zizic Kovacevic, Nino Vukov and Luka Matosic joined the band, forming the original lineup. After a long pause, the band had split up, leaving only Leo and Vinko, who were still playing and creating new songs. In the meantime, they had to find new members. Niksa Zekulic on lead vocals and bass joined the band in February 2006, and Ivo Strunje on the drums in May 2006, both previously involved in a band called Stormblast together with Leo. In June 2006 Ivo left the band, to be replaced with Tino Condic in August 2006. Our first gig was on 11th May 2007, as a warm-up to a heavy metal band from Split called Vega. In August of 2007 Tino left the band. After a two month break, the band continued to work, with an addition to the line-up. Drummer Andrej Zvonimir Tomic has joined them. In March of 2008 Tino grabbed the sticks again. In May of 2008 Vinko left the band. Ivan Tomas took his place. In July of 2008 there were some changes and additions in the line-up: Veljko Radic was added as the new bass player, and now Niksa can devote himself fully to singing duties. Ante Jozinovic replaced Tino on the drums. During 2009 the band played many shows and was involved in a few distinguished events. In November of 2009 they released their first demo, called Just for You. Shortly after, Veljko an Ante had to leave the band due to other commitments. Josip Boban on bass and Ivan Nizetic on the drums came aboard. The band finally broke up in May of 2010.
