In 2005 Matt and Nate put an ad out calling for a drummer in their band called Ascendancy. Nick answered Mattâ€™s ad and joined the band. He later on introduced rhythm guitar player Marc, and formed a new band called Absence of Fear. They went on and played shows at venues all around San Antonio but, at the same time their biggest issue was finding a lead guitar player. In 2008 Nick left the band out of frustration. Ten months later after the band departed, Matt called up Marc and pushed to start the band up again. After trying out countless drummers and guitar players they finally found someone that knew how to play the guitar,. Nick decided to come back and the band changed their name to American Outlaws.

In 2009 they only made two songs Intimidation and Faceless.
Their new guitar player was holding them back by not helping with the writing process. With a bit of luck Matt and Marc went to a friends practice where they were given a number to a lead guitar player, Jon. After meeting up with Jon and watching him play, they decided to have a day of practice. Finally they found their lead guitar. Later they found another drummer by the name of David Castillo who played for the band "Blood of our enemies" who turned out to be the perfect drummer for them. After they changed their name back to "Absence of Fear". Months later they started to write and work on their new Ep "The Rising". The ep was released in may of 2011 along with their first few shows with the new line up, the shows went great and the fans loved the new line up and new music. Absence of Fear shot their first music video for the song "Vengeance is our Religion" with the help of kreukedmedia (http://www.facebook.com/kreukedmedia) in mid June 2011.
