Meg & Dia is an American band formed in 2004. It was founded by sisters Meg and Dia Frampton, originating from Utah, and is now a five-piece act with additional members Nicholas Price, Jonathan Snyder and Carlo Gimenez.

Meg & Dia (previously known as The Meg & Dia Band) released its first album, Our Home Is Gone, in 2005. At the time, the band consisted of just the two Frampton sisters, and the album's tracks were mostly acoustic songs. Meg played guitar and provided back-up vocals while Dia sang. A year later, they released their second album, Something Real, which was their first album released under Doghouse Records.

In 2009, Meg & Dia released their third album Here, Here and Here.  The songs What If and Black Wedding have since been released as singles. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Meg+&+Dia">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
