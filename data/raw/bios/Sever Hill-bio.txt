If you're Severed once, you're Severed Forever, and our fans will certainly vouch for that.

Those who have been Severed have never turned away from our powerful thrashy death metal sound and demanding stage presence.

The high-pitched screamed vocals of DAMO, perfectly supplemented by the low growls of PAT, whose heavy riffs are brilliantly matched by BRAD's technical magic. JACK's enthralling stage work and killer bass is again perfectly in tune with MITCH's epic double bass drumming with amazing use of the underestimated floor tom.

It is this incredible mix which makes SEVER HILL the heavy metal masterpiece which it is very quickly becoming, rising through the ranks of Australia's greatest local metal scene: Adelaide, at great pace.

Having released a 4-track Demo/EP a short time ago, SEVER HILL is more than prepared to hit the ground running with its powerful, headbanging sound <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sever+Hill">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
