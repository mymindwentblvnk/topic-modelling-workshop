Image has been writing and producing music since the age of eight. The songwriter turned lyricist is most known for his work with the underground hip-hop trio, Dark Cloud. The "Shadow Movement" EP is an intense and gritty response to the controlling boundaries of our global culture. The media and political propaghanda that effect our every waking moment are exposed through five blistering tracks of rebellion and retaliation. On, "Shadow Movement," Image sheds the often morbid persona he's known for and engages in all out warfare on the imbalance of society. Look out for more releases by Image in 2007!

Image is also the name of a year 2000 collaboration act between Boy van Lamoen & Tom van der Heijden (who also produce, amonst others, under the aliae Collusion and Solicitous), and the highly succesful Marco Verkuylen & Benjamin Kuyten (aliae: Marco V & Benjamin, Southside Spinners, 8th Wonder, Out of Grace and many others). Together they recorded the trance hit 'Sunpitch' under this alias. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Image">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
