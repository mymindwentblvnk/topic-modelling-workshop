The doom metal band Magilum was founded in the year 2000. The founders were Oguz and Serhat two friends. who decided on a new genre after their heavy metal group “ ARKUN” dissolved. Though not very sorry for their loss, they decided to create their own melancholic, atmospheric “doom” style. Ex “False in truth” member Yigitkan has also been playing with them since Magilum started it’s voyage in their ancient, cataclystic sea. Finally Dincer joined the band as their “brand new” Guitar player. The team was complete. “Magilum” means “ship of the dead” in sumerian mythology, the boat in which the deceased person is placed and left into the sea…. The band has a pessimistic, darkening sound, depressive and melodic in nature, with partly agressive, harsh and partly clean vocals. Magilum is singing in it’s native turkish tongue, never losing it’s grip on their rhtym. The band has an melodic way of playing guitar, occasionaly using keyboards, violin and synths. When they first started they used to be an “extreme doom black” band, with complex guitar riffs, densely using keyboard beneath their melodic, english brutal vocals. Distancing themselves from their old genre in time, they reached their current dense and bare sound which subsequently lead them to the idea of singing in their mother tongue… Their first “semi-professional” single record “Amatory” was recorded in 2003. During this Era, Oguz (lead guitars / Vocals ) prepared an animation video for their single. The band was trying to prepare a 3 song + 1 video interactive CD Project which unfortunately was disrupted because of Oguz and Dincers military service intervention. The band recorded a 3 song mini cd demo the same year, consisting of Ancient Sea, I would deny and Amatory. Unfortunately… this demo was also never released. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Magilum">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
