Flaskavsae was formed in 2005, recorded my debut album 'Celestial' which was never released for various reasons. released my 2nd effort (first on a label) 'Eclipse In Tides' in August 2006. released a split album with Nahum in December 2006. Released my latest full-length 'Philosophies' in May 2007. the previously unreleased album 'Celestial' will see the light of day in Summer 2007. also expect to see split albums with Dark Procession and Light Shall Prevail before the end of 2007!!!
