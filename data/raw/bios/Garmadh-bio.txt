At the beginning of the year 2006, Garmadh begun life as Sedith at Eskisehir. While the group was working as Sedith, the drummer has been changed and after continie  some time like that, the group has been suspended because of various reasons.

    After one or two months, the old band members Tayrat(vocals), Hellchief(guitars), Insedith(bass) and Zyklon-B(drums) decided to get together again with a new name; Garmadh.

    Garmadh worked hard for a long time and they recorded 2 cover songs. After this records, Garmadh started to being prepared for their demo cd. At this time the group decided in common to change the bassist and with this decision Insedith left the band.

    After this, Garmadh started to record their demo cd and Tayrat played bass guitars when they were recording, because they couldnâ€™t find a bassist for a while. As soon as recording the demo had been finished, they started to search for a new bassist again and Suicide(Bass) joined the group in a short time.

    The first demo cd entitled Debris of History was released in October 2007, which includes an intro and 4 tracks titled Captive of Endlessness, Cold Bloods, Carnage With Satan and Debris of History.This demo released and distributed by Turkish U.G Bm label Total Death Productions. 

    The group is training for new organisations nowadays and working for futural split album besides a few projects.
