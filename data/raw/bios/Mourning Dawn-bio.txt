Born as one-man-band from the south of France in 2002, Mourning Dawn came into life with the release of the two demos "Mourning Dawn" and "Straight to the past". Recorded with a small budget, theses demos already show a band which wants to avoid stereotypes while giving a dark and violent music.

However, having no entire satisfaction from theses demos, Laurent decided to record a promotional EP once more (later re-released on Ostra Records) which shows the new direction of the band. A music that doesn't hesitate to slow down and play on atmospheres much more than on brutality.

The feedback this EP received helped the project to grow up and to create its first real album. That one, simply entitled "Mourning Dawn" was released by Totalrust Music, during 2007. Recorded with a better production, this new album got very good feedbacks from the critics and 'zines, especially concerning the dark and obscure atmosphere that emerges from it, and the extreme harshness of the vocals.

Since October 2005, Laurent decided to make Mourning Dawn a live band, and found a line up that ended up being : Laurent (guitar, vocals), Vincent (bass), Fabien (Guitars), Nico (drums).

With that line-up was recorded the 2nd full length called "For the fallen", again released on totalrust Music in 2009, which propelled the band to the forefront of the scene. Quickly, shows followed with bands as Evoken, Forgotten Tomb, Ahab, Isole, Ataraxie, and many more all around Europe...


Now, the band is actually composing for its 3rd album, yet untitled, that will surely mark a new step into musical darkness
