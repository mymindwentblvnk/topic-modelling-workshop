Years & Years is the solo project of British singer-songwriter, producer, and multi-instrumentalist Olly Alexander. Originally formed in 2010 as a trio consisting of Olly Alexander, Mikey Goldsworthy, and Emre Türkmen, Years & Years' music has been described as electropop, mixing R&B and 1990s house elements. The band's debut studio album, Communion, debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart in July 2015 and was the fastest-selling debut album of the year from a UK signed band.

Their biggest hit single "King" from their debut album Communion reached number one in the UK Singles Chart in March 2015, and peaked within the top ten of the charts in Australia, Austria, Bulgaria, Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Ireland and Switzerland. Their single "Shine" from the same album reached number two on the UK Singles Chart.

In April 2018 they announced the release of their second studio album Palo Santo which features singles "Sanctify" and "If You're Over Me", the latter of which reached the top 10 in the United Kingdom. The album features a dystopian world consisting of robot-like beings named Androids and humans as the minority, and was released on 6 July 2018.

On 18 March 2021, the band announced a third Years & Years album would be released in 2021. The band also announced the same day that Goldsworthy and Türkmen had stepped down as active members, and that the act would continue as the solo project of Alexander. The album, titled Night Call, was released in January 2022, debuting at number one in the UK albums chart. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Years+&+Years">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
