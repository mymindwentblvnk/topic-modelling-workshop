There are four bands named Total War:

1) Total War is a dance-oriented indie band from Asheville NC, USA. Their most recent release is the EP all you have. An earlier demo can be found on last.fm under Totalwar.

2) Total War is also a raw D-Beat punk band from Vancouver, Canada. They've so far released an 8-track demo cassette tape in 2011.

3) A Swedish black metal "super group" that was formed by members of bands like Dark Funeral, Hypocrisy and Ophthalamia. They released two albums and then the project was put on ice for the future. The 2001 release "We Are Total...War" consists of their two releases on one disc.
Formally named War, but they are known in the U.S. as Total War, due to legal reasons.

4) A Straight edge Hatecore band from USA. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Total+War">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
