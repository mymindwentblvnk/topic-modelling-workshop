Introitus is the name of more than one artist:

1) Black metal pioneers in Eastern Europe and as the first black metal act from Serbia (Kragujevac)

2) progressive rock band from Vansbro, Sweden. Formed by Mats Bender (keyboards and accordion) and his wife Anna (lead vocals), it's a 'family band', as their son Mattias is the drummer, and their daughter Johanna, who was a member of the choir singing on the first album, has now become the second lead vocalist. The current line-up is completed by Pär Helje (lead guitar), Dennis Lindkvist (bass guitar) and Henrik Björlind (extra synth, accordion, flute, fiddle and second guitar).
Their first album "Fantasy" was released in 2007. Although it wasn't noticed immediately, it eventually got a perfect score of 5/5 in a review of the Dutch "Background Magazine". A second album called "Elements" was released in March 2011, while the third album "Anima" has been released in August 2014. All albums received the perfect score of 5/5 from "Background Magazine".

Johanna Bender left the band in March 2013, but still sings backing vocals on the latest album "Anima", and also appeared as one of the dancers on the album cover.
Henrik Björlind left in 2017, and was replaced by Linnéa Syrjälä, the girlfriend of Mattias Bender.
The fourth album, "Shadows", was released in June 2019. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Introitus">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
