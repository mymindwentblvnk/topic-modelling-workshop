Progressive Jazz Metal from Germany.

The fusion of jazz-rock with heavy metal is not an easy nor readily accepted form of music, and requires players of unusual vision and abilities. Berlin trio COUNTER-WORLD EXPERIENCE have been creating such a music since their inception in Hannover, 2002. The group is comprised of three of Germany's most accomplished young musicians, guitarist/synthist Benjamin Schwenen, Thorsten Harnitz on drums, and world-class bassist H.D. Lorenz. The sound is quite unique though they occasionally remind of a less grandiose PLANET X, with hints of KING CRIMSON, JOE SATRIANI and even NEBELNEST.

2002 saw their debut "Always Home", primarily a modern fusion outing. 'Fraktal', their second release in the summer of 2004, introduced electronic sounds and heavier guitar layers, bringing in strong elements of metal and high-tech synthesis. In 2006 they recorded their third, 'Leaving Lotus', described by Schwenen as "Cybernetic metal combining with smooth, Pat Metheny-like texturing."

Full of complexity, innovation and surprises, COUNTER-WORLD EXPERIENCE is a band that extends the power trio concept into the future and progresses the state of both metal and fusion. (from progarchives.com)
