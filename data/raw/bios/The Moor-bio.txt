1) Founded in September of 2008, The Moor's creative core consists of musical and romantic duo Erica Daking (ex-F-Minus) and Josiah Steinbrick (ex-F-Minus), transplanted from the North East to Los Angeles at the turn of the millennium. Their debut album was recorded with Ben Lovett in the basement of their Victorian home, amidst the cozied hills and winding vistas of the east side's Mount Washington neighborhood. The resulting eight songs are a haunting concoction of synthesizers, piano, subdued guitars, and mesmerizing vocals, creating a raw wall of sound that evokes and impresses with equal measure. With musical contributions from Josh Klinghoffer (PJ Harvey, Red Hot Chili Peppers), Simon Lord (Simian, Black Ghosts), and Bryan Hollon (Boom Bip, Neon Neon) and finishing touches by mix guru Noah Georgeson (Joanna Newsom, The Strokes) the swagger of the instrumentation couples with the moody, candid lyrics and the velvet arrangements in a dream-scape of hypnotic rhythms.

A cabaret of the imagination, The Moor's live show expands the album through a lush blend of precision and improvisation, where they're joined on stage by members of such bands as Warpaint, Darker My Love, and Little Joy. Not to be missed, the experience draws the listener further into the pretty, mercurial world painted so deftly on the album.

Born in New York and raised by a duet of musicians, Erica has been writing and recording music since she was thirteen. Steinbrick, a Providence native and composer, is often sought out by the likes of Danger Mouse, Devendra Banhart, and White Fence's Tim Presley for his work both in the studio and on stage.
