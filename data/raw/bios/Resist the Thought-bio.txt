Hailing from Campbelltown, Resist The Thought is a 5-piece metalcore/death metal band. With influences ranging from All Shall Perish and As Blood Runs Black to Parkway Drive and August Burns Red, Resist The Thought are continually striving to make the band all that it can be. 

The Band originally formed in 2003 consisting of Rick on Guitar, Jake on drums and Matt on bass and then later on vocals as well. They started off mucking around and playing music just for the fun of it and played a few shows at the ages of 11 and 14. 

Over the years they have gone through and experimented with all styles of music and have played just about anything to everything. The boys got to a certain stage in time where they realised that they wanted to take things further than the spare room and recruit new members to suit a heavier genre. School friends Alex Miezio on bass and Timmy Aaron on guitar were then added to the line up of the band in early 2007. Miezio playing bass for the band resulted in Matt taking the full time front man position on vocals. They wrote a few songs and played a few shows until later on going separate way with bass player Alex. 

Matt then decided to go back to his roots on bass and search for a new singer. Old friend Rhys Giles was found as the new vocalist completing the line-up in late July 2007. Resist The Thought as much as a family as a band has worked persistently to create their own sound and style and live for music. The band writes the music for their own satisfaction but loves the fans that they have and really appreciates their support.
