The Band was formed in 2003 in Thessaloniki under the name Abhorrent Bestiality.The first line up was: Lazaros-vocals, Kostas-bass, Alex-guitar/backing vocals, Panagiotis-drums.
 
After some rehearsals Panagiotis left the band and was replaced by Nikos. With this formation they did their first live with COCKROACH. They also participated in the ATC PRODUCTIONS COMPILATION CD and a compilation made by their friend KGB. Then Lazaros left the band and they continued as a trio for some months until the arrival of Bill. This formation lasted until 2006. They recorded a demo with shitty sound and played various gigs with bands like Cerebral Turbulency, Sick Terror, Gutted, Korog, Radicals Amputation, Terrorismo Musical, Epithanatios Roghos and many others.

In the summer of 2006 they recorded their self titled cd with the assistance of Mooth on drums & production. Soon afterwards Nikos left the band and some months later so did Kostas due to the obligatory military service. In February 2007 came Nikolakis on drums and Mitsos on bass and now they are going on like thatâ€¦    <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cut+Your+Throat">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
