There are more than one artist with this name:

1) Murderous punk from the purgatory, in Swedish, of course!

The band started out in Stockholm in the year of 2007 with members from the recently broken up Sleepless Nights with Erik (Frontlash, Contemptious,), Hasse (Dims Rebellion), Micke (Dobermann Cult, The Radars, Sabouteur, Sthlms Blodbad, The Pints) & Into.

In 2008 Erik decided to leave the band and we recruited David (Targetpoint) as bass player and the following year we upgraded our sound with an extra guitar player, Anders (Rogues Utd., Makabert Fynd). The same year Micke decided to leave the band and Maria (BEAST!) became our new drum player.

In the year of 2010 Anders decided to leave the band to focus on his other projects and Niklas (Splitter, Tinner) was recruited as the new guitar player.
