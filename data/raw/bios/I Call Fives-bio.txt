Described as “hyper-catchy and highly caffeinated” by the Philadelphia Weekly, I Call Fives has become known for their high-energy sound and relentless stage presence. Identified as front-runners in the next generation of pop-punk, the band is ready to take charge of the opportunity to assert themselves against the backdrop of the ever-exploding New Jersey scene by presenting audiences with straight-forward, feel-good pop-punk.
Since their formation in 2006, I Call Fives has been extending their horizons beyond the East Coast, hitting stages in 33 states across the country on a rigorous touring schedule. In addition to aiding their notoriety, their journey has led to successful sales their debut 2008 EP First Things First, despite the band offering the album for free across the Internet. First Things First has been highly acclaimed, earning the band multiple spots on Distortion Radio’s top 100 Songs of 2008, among other accolades.


Kicking off 2010, I Call Fives will return to Baltimore, MD to record their second EP, Bad Advice, for No Sleep Records.  With this new release and non-stop touring to follow, 2010 will surely be the biggest year yet for I Call Fives.
