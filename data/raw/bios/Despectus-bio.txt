The story began in late autumn 2006 when Cyril Dementis (guitar) met Yan 'Atrox (drums) who was accepted as a keyboardist at that time. 

 After writing the first song Yan and Cyrill started searching for the rest of the staff and working out the concept of the band at the same time. 

 It appeared to be a hard work. More than 15 candidates were examined, the band has changed its name 2-3 times. At last they found bass-gutarist Sergey Shinigami and later the other members: Alexander Master (keyboards) and the beauty of the band - Oksana Element.   

 The list of members was finally confirmed in august 2008. The band progressed and gave its first concert on 28 of November. 

 In early 2011 Despectus decided to fill the place of second guitar player which remained vacant till that time. Dmitry Miroshnichenko have been chosen from many candidates. 

 Since that time we develop the original Despectus sounding and style, give concerts. 

 In our music we tried to combine technics and speed of death metal, melodiousness of gothic metal and also power and strength of sympho black metal, which is achieved due to the powerful parts of keyboards and drums.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Despectus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
