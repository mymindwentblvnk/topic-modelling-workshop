Formed from the remains of 'Future Call', the band adopted Sydney vocalist Nick Holland as lead singer, to join James, Mobsy and Sam. Since then, the band (under the working name 'Amistad') has been writing new material and re-writing some old songs to form a new sound. When asked who they sound like, Amistad responds 'No one. We are our own.'
