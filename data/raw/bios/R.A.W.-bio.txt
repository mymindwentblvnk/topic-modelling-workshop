There are several R.A.W.'s:

1) R.A.W. - melodic hard rock band from Sweden.

R.A.W consists of the two brother Bosse and Anders Lindmark and if you're familiar with the band DALTON you'll probably recognise the names on three of the members in R.A.W. R.A.W was formerly known as a coverband called PUMP which have been playing together with a lot of Swedish guest stars for ex. Ian Haugland, Lili & Sussie, Tommy Nilsson and Kee Marcello. In the beginning of 1992 the band was signed to EMI Sweden and started to write songs for an album and their first single "First Time Love" made a clear entrance on the charts in the beginning of 1995. R.A.W and their former recordcompany got into what you can call a disagreement. The band broke up all former agreements with the company, but it didn't take to long until their second single was released on a different label. The full length album, mentioned above was simply titled "First" relating to the nature of it. R.A.W made a new start with the new name and buries the past. The single "Don't Tell Me Lies" and the album "First" was released in 1995. Before the band broke up R.A.W released the second album "Now We're Cookin'" in 1997. MTM CLASSIX is now re-releasing "First" as it's a very sought after collectors item and the re-issue is featuring two unreleased bonus tracks.


2) R.A.W. står för Ronny Andreas Wahlqvist och är namnet på en (någorlunda) ung, gunstig herre från Stockholm, Sverige. Han har älskat hip-hop så länge han kan minnas och troligtvis ännu längre än så, då minneskapaciteten inte är den bästa.

3) Raoul Gonzalez also known as 6Blocc.

4) R.A.W. is a young Czech female fronted metal band. Their style revolves aroung melodic metal with power/heavy elements.
