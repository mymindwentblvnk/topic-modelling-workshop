Zorakarer is an American symphonic black metal band that was formed in early 2012 in Portland, OR by Jacob Williams (Barrowlands) as a recording project but soon brought to life by recruiting Phil Cancilla (Hank lll, Ex-misericordiam,) to record drums for the band’s first demo and full length. Zorakarer then released its first demo “MMXlll” on February 24th 2013. Due to Phil being unable to relocate to Portland from Las Vegas, Jacob began looking elsewhere for new members. He soon recruited Brandon Gulling (Ex-Avenger of Blood, Touring guitarist for Bonded by Blood) on guitar, Jeremy Hamilton on bass (Ex-Avenger of Blood), and Jason Borton (Ex-Wayfarer) to handle drums to complete the line-up. Zorakarer will be releasing its first full length album in early February 2014. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Zorakarer">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
