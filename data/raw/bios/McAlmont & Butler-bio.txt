McAlmont and Butler are an English rock/soul music duo, comprising singer David McAlmont and guitarist Bernard Butler.

After Butler's acrimonious split from Suede, he teamed up with ex-Thieves singer McAlmont. They had a bonafide hit in their debut single Yes in 1995, a grandiose pop song. Following the release of the compilation The Sound of McAlmont & Butler, they split acriminously the following year in 1996.

Reconvening in 2001 to record a second album Bring It Back successfully fused Butler's magical guitar, McAlmont's soulful voice, with swooning and swelling Phil Spector girl-band style arrangements. The album disappointed commercially, and an almost-completed 3rd album is still without a label to release it. The song Speed, taken from those third album sessions, was released in 2006 as a download and a limited edition 7" single.

McAlmont then completed a jazz standard-themed solo album; and Butler reunited with Suede partner, Brett Anderson, to form The Tears. They released Here Come the Tears in 2005 to rave reviews. Following this, Butler received great acclaim for his production work on Welsh songstress' Duffy's debut, Rockferry. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/McAlmont+&+Butler">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
