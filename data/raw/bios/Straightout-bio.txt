STRAIGHTOUT were formed in May 1998 by Pipinx(Guitar) and Muy(Vocal). Influenced by Metallic Hardcore bands such as Earth Crisis and Strife as a start.

After several line-up changes the band released their first full-lenght album "Undying Beauty and the Symphony of Sadness" in 2003, with a line up - Pipinx(Guitar), Rendy(Guitar), Bayu(Vocal), Donny(Keyboard), Sonny(Bass), and Benny(Drums). The album provides harmonically powerful guitar riffs, heavy hitting on drums, atmospheric aura from the keyboard, and emotional sreaming and melodious notes from the vocal and the female backing vocal (Rebecca).  

In 2005 the line up changed. Donny is replaced by the new keyboardist, Mella. Rendi is replaced by Danny-the ex-Perfect Minors and Bayu is replaced by Demise Ex-vocalist from Sadistist. with this line up the band released their 2nd full length "Forsaken Upon Nemesis" which showcased band progression into melodic death metal realm while keeping small trait of metalcore element.

The band released their third album entitled "Nocturnal Born Vehemence" In 2013 with new line up, Nyoman (Guitar) and Prama (Drum) both formely SiksaKubur member. Panjie also serve as their new bassist. "Nocturnal Born Vehemence" marked StraightOut full transformation as melodic death metal band, leaving behind metalcore traits and losing their keyboardist in the process.
