Sammath Naur (meaning 'Crack of Doom' - adapted from JRR Tolkien's works) is a progressive black/death metal band formed in 1994. Their music is characterized by fast guitar lines (both rhythm and solos), epic choir-like background keyboards and a combination of both guttural and screamed vocals; generally with a unique cosmic atmosphere. The bands line-up has changed several times; Currently, Lestath on the Drums/Vocals, Sigmar on Guitar, V on Guitar/Keyboards, Tas on Bass and Revisque with Synthesis. 

After the release of 'Self-Proclaimed Existence', the potential of Sammath Naur has been recognised quickly by other artists, let alone prospective fans. In the present, Lestath drums in Esqarial and V also plays for Vesania. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sammath+Naur">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
