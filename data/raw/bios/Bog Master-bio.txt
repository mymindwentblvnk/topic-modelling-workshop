Lumbering ponderously forth from the murky miasma of the swamp crawls a new species of modern music.

Spawned from the minds of ennui afflicted teenagers, Bog Masters consistant musical goal has been transcending the commonplace and forging their own path. Despite the bands penchant for the atypical they have still found their niche in the Hamilton music scene, released two recordings and garnered an audience for their aural assailing. In earlier days, the bands sound was more firmly rooted in the realm of experimental metal. Their much heralded debut album "The Enigmatic Toad Quandary" remains a landmark effort in the burgeoning genre of "Avant Garde Shit Metal". Briefly venturing into near black metal ferocity the group surged forward with temporary keyboard recruit Mike Pomeroy. Recently, Bog Master has undergone a further metamorphosis into a seething hot funk, rock and metal geyser. Their visually arresting and exuberant live performances have been described as "A chaotic carnival of raw human energy" and "Really gay". With a new album advancing and soon to be unleashed, Bog Master stand resolute against the slews of musically mundane artists and are ready to make an impact. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bog+Master">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
