2. Up-and-coming crust/death metal band from Staten Island, NY. The name was formerly used by a one-man black metal project from Cincinnati, Ohio but the band changed it's name to Sapthuran. The name is also in use by a Swedish death/thrash metal band who have released a total of 5 demos over 12 years of being together and nothing else.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Enthralled">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
