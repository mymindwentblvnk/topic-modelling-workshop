Asgaard was formed by Bartek Kostrzewa and Pawel Nafus in mid-1994. Their first demo, recorded in July '95 and named 'Excellent Darkness Art', was in a strict doom-gothic style. Two years later, the debut album 'When the Twilight Set in Again' came out. Over the next six years, Asgaard recorded three more albums, which collected kind reviews in Poland and also beyond its borders. Meanwhile Przemek Olbryt, who has an extraordinary vocal talent, joined the band. One year ago the sixth album 'EyeMDX-tasy' came out. Nowadays, the Asgaard's music is split between gothic and (as members of the band call it) symphonic black metal style. Complete, Asgaard's art is a majestic mixture of mystery, darkness, beauty and the incredible sound of Przemek Olbryt's voice. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Asgaard">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
