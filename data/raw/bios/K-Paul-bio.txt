DJ and producer K-Paul (Kai Paul in real life) hails from the former cold war state of East Germany. And since starting his career behind the infamous Berlin Wall, he's developed a reputation for having one of unified Germany's most talented pair of hands in a recording studio. Since the late '90s he's been reeling off one quality production after another, including popular tunes like "If You Know What I Mean," "Rage Hard," and "Please (Ma) Baby." His partnership with another of Germany's house maestros, DJ Lexy, has been particularly rewarding. The pair, aptly known as Lexy & K-Paul, became world-renowned courtesy of the chart toppers "The Greatest DJ" and "Freak." In 1999, K-Paul also remixed the Dr Motte and Westbam track "Music Is the Key," which was the official anthem of the hugely popular Love Parade rave. ~ David Peter Wesolowski, Rovi <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/K-Paul">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
