Eddie Amador has been a busy man. Earlier this year he moved to Amsterdam (The Netherlands) to concentrate on production and DJing. "Living in Los Angeles, the scene is dominated by Hip Hop and Trance" he explains. "It was rare that I even DJ'd there. I was constantly flying to Europe and the rest of the world to DJ, sometimes 2-3 times a month." He felt uninspired to produce and felt that moving to Europe for a little while would get his creative juices flowing again. Good move. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Eddie+Amador">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
