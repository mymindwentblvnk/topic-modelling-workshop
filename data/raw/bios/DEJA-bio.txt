DEJA is the kind of woman we all want to be. Unapologetic, talented, sassy and bold. She places relatable and fiery lyrics on sticky rhythmic R&B-pop production. She sings, she dances and she never bites her tongue. Lower your sunglasses as DEJA's songs are the ‘verbal eye-rolls’ you never knew you needed. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/DEJA">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
