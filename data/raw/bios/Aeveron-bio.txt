Aeveron is a German Melodic Black Metal band - formed in March of 2002. Six adept musicians decided to unify. Their diverse musical influences and ideas in one formation called Aeveron.

Soon it became apparent that the created pieces could hardly be assigned to 
one specific musical style.

But since the so called “stereotypical thinking” has become indispensable even 
in the music scene, Aeveron consider that the term “Melodic Sweden Death” 
seems to be adequate as an orientation.
