The band SCARLET WINGS was formed in February, 2006, when members of previously decaying bands POSEIDON & GLORION linked together. Actually, they are without the keyboard player and looking for someone to play the backround chords. The music of SCARLET WINGS is very close to the sound of GLORION, and as a matter of fact it is classical heavy metal. 

If anyone would expect us to give some heroic musical performance,then he probably has mistaken the band,since our original plan was to play simple and honest(true) Rock and we would like to keep it that way. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Scarlet+Wings">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
