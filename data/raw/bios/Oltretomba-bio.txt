During the spring of 2008, Voodoo Stu (vocals), Alex (guitar), Spooky Marky (keyboards), Redstripe (bass) and ilBarone (drums)formed OLTRETOMBA.
A year later they began their experiences on stage as the opening act for bands like UK Decay, Inca Babies, and Bettina Koster ( Malaria).
In February 2009 they recorded their first self-titled demo with four songs: "Chainsaw Therapy" - "My Zombie Nextdoor" - "Donâ€™t Be Afraid Of A Massgrave" and "Arkham Maniacs".
At the end of 2009 Stu left the band, passing the baton to Flo, excellent frontgirl.
After a while Marky left the band too.
Shortly after, in January of 2010, they restarted doing live concerts with the average of 1 venue a month, featuring artists like Rikk Agnew, Nekromantix, The Deep Eynde.
The time has come to produce a new demo containing two songs: "Forefinger Of Dawn" and "Lover" songs that proved to be very succesfull during live performances.
The sound of Oltretomba is a mix between punk rock and goth blended with psichedelic guitar arrangements along with the presence of a melodic female voice.
In 2012 they recorded their first album called "Acid Rain".
Flo left the band shortly after, passing the baton to Vanessa.
