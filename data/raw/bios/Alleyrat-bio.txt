The band consisted of Lance Diechmann (vocals and blues harp), Fred "Rambone" Vargas (bass), Steve Brady (drums) and myself, Eric Ramirez (lead guitar and backing vocals.) We are from San Diego, California and even though we aren't together anymore we still remain good friends. If you have any questions i'll be glad to answer them. Thanks for listening to the music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Alleyrat">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
