Miseo (ancient greek for hate) was founded in January 2013 by the scene known musicians Ferli Thielmann (Vox / Guitar, also Milking The Goatmachine, Carnal Ghoul), Timo Claas (drums, also Lay Down Rotten) and André Rink (bass). The musical direction is Death Metal with U.S. and old school influences of the 90´s. Full of energy, the three musicians have composed the first songs for an EP, which were recorded in March 2013 at the "Desert Inn" recording studio (Lay Down Rotten, Milking The Goatmachine) in Edingen, Germany. The sound and lyrics are a brutal response to the pressures of reality in our age. Lyrical topics are the effects of greed, envy and ruthless egoism packed in a garment of hate.
In May 2013 the band signed a deal with the german label "Blacksmith Records"
The first EP "The Dead Will Predominate" will be out at 23.08.2013 via Blacksmith Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/MISEO">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
