Akrosom is a Progressive Metal superhero Quintet from Zagreb, Croatia. The members include Leo Grbac and Nino Hiveš(guitar),  Mislav Vidaček(Bass), Matej Blečić(keyboards) and Tihomir Lovrić(drums).

After the original line up was formed, Akrosom started looking for a sound that would leave a signature mark on Croatia's (nonexistent) progressive world. This resulted in the addition of Matej Blečić on the synth and Nino Hiveš on the musical saw (actually, guitar) to the superforce progressive ranks.

The recording of Demo-Lition soon began, the album is due mid 2009.

The band is currently looking for a singer. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Akrosom">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
