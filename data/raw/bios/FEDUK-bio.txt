Feduk (real name Fedor Andreevich Insarov) is a Russian singer, hip-hop - and house rap singer and songwriter. He began his solo career in 2010, having since released one mini-album and five studio albums.

He was born on February 9, 1992 in Moscow. His father Father teaches physical education at MGIMO and his mother is a teacher of Russian language and literature. He also has a brother named Cyril.

From early childhood, he traveled to different countries due to his father teaching in various schools at the Russian embassies. When Feduk was 5, his family moved to China, and at the age of 11, Fedor came to Hungary, where he lived for four years. Later, Fedor admits to reporters that he first heard rap in Budapest. The young man was so hooked on this style of performance that he began to try to compose his own songs. In the same place, in Hungary, Fedor met a like-minded person who bore the pseudonym Rodnique. This man began to help the novice rapper, and the guys even recorded several joint tracks.

The name Feduk is also associated with Hungary, under which Fedor Insarov became famous. The answer to the pseudonym is simple: the fact is that Feduk sounds more organic to the Hungarian ear than Fedor. Therefore, in Budapest, the young man was addressed in this way.

In 2013 he recorded the main track for Anton Bormatov's film "ОколоФутбола". The song became a hit, but began to associate Fedor with the image of a "football hooligan". Subsequently, he released three albums in a row. In 2014 he participated in "Versus Battle #2" where in Battle defeated Yung Trappa. Real success came to Fedor in 2017 after the release of the song "Розовое вино", recorded together with rapper Элджей, which became one of the main Russian-language hits of the year. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Feduk">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
