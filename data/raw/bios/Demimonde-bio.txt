Very interesting dark mix of post metal (death, black, doom, progressive...), ambient, programming, up tempo and down tempo shifts, male and female vocals with strong atmosphere and genre-breaks in one monolithic piece.

Czech band, starting play again in 2012/2013, preparing new album.
New track (released 2014/12/23) Laval Formation posted on-line!
