The IDLE GEAR band was formed in 2011 in St. Petersburg, Russia.
The first Demo EP, called 'Nail In My Head', was released in the 20th of November 2011 and included four demos. The 'Deathdealer' single + bonus came out in the 27th of August 2012.

The main genres are Stoner/Stoner Metal/ Southern Metal.
We try to mix the heavy sound with the good melody and well developed composition.
