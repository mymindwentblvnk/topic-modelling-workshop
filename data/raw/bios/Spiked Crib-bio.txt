Spiked Crib a Symphonic Metal Band with elements like screeching vocals and keyboards. The originals are influenced by Gothic poetry and address the darker aspects of life. What started as a poetry blog, the band – after several line-up changes – settled down after three months and decided to go live from December 2007. The musical exploits of the band have been a success at just about every venue that they have played. Spiked Crib is looking forward to recording its first album by 2009 and their first original, Russet Dawn, Inane Days can be heard on www.myspace.com/spikedcrib
