2) M.O.R. (short for Menace of Ruin) was formed in Montreal, Canada in 2005 by Genevi√®ve (Menace Ruine, Preterite) and S. de la Moth (Menace Ruine, S/V\R). They performed live once and recorded an unreleased cassette before breaking up in 2006. In 2007 they continued to play together, changing name to Menace Ruine. In 2016 their M.O.R. cassette named "Anthems To The Disembodied" was released to celebrate its 10th year anniversary. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/M.O.R.">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
