Fate Gear (stylized as FATE GEAR) is a Japanese all-female heavy metal band from Tokyo, formed in 2015 by guitarist Mina.

Five months after leaving Destrose due to ongoing health issues, guitarist Mina announced the formation of Fate Gear with vocalist Nico in July 2015. Also consisting of guest bassist Sakae and guest drummer Hiro, they made their live debut on August 1 at Meguro Rock-May-Kan. Their debut album, A Light in the Black, was released on August 12 and includes a re-recording of a Destrose song.

In May 2016, Kurumi Fujioka from the band Mysterious Priestess joined Fate Gear as keyboardist. However, Hiro had her last performance with the band on May 28.

They released their second album Oz -Rebellion- on June 21, 2017, via their own record label, Steam Steel Records. Its opening track was arranged by former Terra Rosa keyboardist Masashi Okagaki.

Fate Gear's third album 7 Years Ago was released on April 11, 2018, and includes Mina's past project Arch Roses's song "Fenixx 2011". It also features several guest vocalists and musicians.

The EP Headless Goddess was released on January 9, 2019, and is composed almost entirely of re-recorded Destrose songs. Once again, Fate Gear collaborated with several guest vocalists on the EP.

The collaborations continued with their January 13, 2021, album, The Sky Prison. The EP Scars in my Life -English Edition- followed just days later on January 27
