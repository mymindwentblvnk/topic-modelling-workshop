Archives were a Dundee based band (May 2006 - July 2008) who featured former members of The Fall of Boss Koala, A Written Apology, Avast! and others.

The band sat somewhere between screamo, post hardcore and post rock and were influenced by the likes of Daitro, Envy, Red Sparowes, From Monument to Masses.

They have a 3 track demo from 2007 and a 6 track album 'Decline' which was released in 2009 on DiZZY SToRM Records
