Madra were a blisteringly heavy band,  formed in 2002 as a cross community project between  Derry and Donegal, to try to help integrate the later into a more civilized society. It worked all too well. Members Paddy Doran, Conor Mullan, Mike Ahern and Tony Barr went on to create somewhat of a stir in the local metal scene through their love of meat and the riffs that result from an unhealthy kebab/chicken box diet. Tearing through your soul with their riffs Madra went on to destroy Finland on a short (but well received) tour. Disbanded in 2007 due to being sick of the sight (and smell) of one another each member has moved on to other projects such as Countervela, Stand Up Guy, Shiro, Softsoftstatic <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Madra">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
