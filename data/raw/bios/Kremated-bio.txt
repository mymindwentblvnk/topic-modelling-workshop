Kremated combine a genuine love of 1980â€™s underground Thrash Metal and Crossover with a good measure of East Coast Hardcore and Crustpunk. Thrash was always about pushing the boundaries, and Kremated are not afraid to slip in the occasional blastbeat or breakdown to keep listeners on their toes. This is a snotty, no holds barred attack on the senses, spanning the gaps between full-tilt Speed Metal, dirty beatdowns and punk rants. Imagine Exodus, Terror and The Exploited having a punchup at Celtic Frost's rehearsal space...
Kremated feature current and past members of Viral Technology, Bun Dem Out, Buried Beneath The Ashes, Blut Faust, Acid Tongue and Clungeplunger. Their debut mini album "Total Warfare" has been received very well by press and fans alike, and they have been described as "positively dangerous" as a live act." Their second album "Three Minute Warning" has just been released. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kremated">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
