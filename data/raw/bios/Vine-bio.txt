There are two artists with the name "Vine".

1. The solo project of Staten Island-based psychedelic rock musician Vinny (aka Vinny from Vinesauce), a member of the band Red Vox, and previously a member of Davy's Grey. Since 2007, Vinny has released three albums and one compilation under the Vine name.

2. Mid-90's emo band from Kalamazoo, Michigan.  They started off as a band called Firesale, broke up and reformed minus one member to form Vine.  They were associated with Constantine Sankathi, Jihad, Ordination of Aaron and the rest of the midwest emo scene, although today they're pretty obscure.  After Vine broke up, members joined with ex-members of Ordination of Aaron, and Current to form Broken Hearts are Blue.  

As far as i know they released a demo cassette, a couple of comp. songs and a self-titled 7". This along with two live songs as well as a compilation of other unreleased songs are available here: http://www.last.fm/user/withinasound/journal/2009/06/03/2rqhuy_90%27s_emo_upload_collection. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vine">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
