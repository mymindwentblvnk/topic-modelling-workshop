BORN WITH WORMS INSIDE was born early 2007 when Jibé and Flo got fired from their previous band and wanted to play some mid-tempo gore grind filled with plenty of others influences, and this is exactly what came out with the first songs flo wrote while they were looking for a drummer and a guitarist. One year later some other songs were written but still no guitarist . So being pissed off some stuff are recorded in july with the line-up Flo: bass, guitars, drum programing + vocals and Jibé : vocals. The demo is finished and available, just ask for it .

Demo is on free download here : http://www.megaupload.com/?d=R0GT79HW .

News songs are ready and others are on their way.

Feb 2009, after two years since the band's creation we have finally found a guitar player (actually he found us !), being Ed, less ugly than us but grooving all the same ! Which means gigs soon !

New recordings are available on cd-r as a 2nd demo "Losers Groovy Losers" and will be edited on split-cd by Spastic Colon Prod.
