Formed in October 2010 by former Imagika Lead Guitarist Steve Rice and Imagika Drummer Wayne DeVecchi KILL RITUAL began as a continuation of the music Steve and Wayne had been working on before the demise of Imagika. After recruiting former Eldritch guitarist Roberto Proietti, former Dark Angel bassist Danyael Williams and SF Bay Area vocalist Josh Gibson the band immediately set to work on the writing and recording of their debut CD. Bringing in elements of the collective members history KILL RITUAL has forged a sound where classic and modern Metal meet.

KILL RITUALâ€™s debut was Engineered and Produced by Lead Guitarist Steve Rice and tracked at Fang Studios (drums) San Mateo California and Fossil Sound (guitars, bass, and vocals) San Jose California. Mixing/Mastering by Andy LaRocque at Sonic Train Studios Varberg Sweden. Cover and Logo art was designed by Jobert Mello for Sledgehammer Graphix (Sabaton, Primal Fear)
