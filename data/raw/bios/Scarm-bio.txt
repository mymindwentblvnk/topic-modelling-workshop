Hailing from St Petersberg, Russia, Scarm have been experimenting with guitar sounds since 2007 and building post-rock compositions around their results.  Their music is a game of contrasts: from near-silent melodies to slabs of grievous noise.  Scarm do not use samples or synths, instead choosing to generate their landscapes with processed guitar noise.  They seek to make something truly new.
