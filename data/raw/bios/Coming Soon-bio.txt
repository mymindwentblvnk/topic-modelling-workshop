3 artists under the name Coming Soon

1/ Taking in West Coast French anti-folk band with vocal performances that variously recall the drained baritone of Leonard Cohen and Moldy Peaches as fronted by Suggs, the debut album by this French seven-piece (who’ve busked in Covent Garden) is all over the place in the very best of ways. Ages range from 15 to 26, subjects from kissing like Jack Nicholson to the brand of blues specifically associated with baking pies for your mother’s third wedding.
They signed to Kitchen Music from Paris, these young troubadours make you dance, think and smile.
