Borean Dusk formed in the Spring of 2008. As a tight four-piece unit of seasoned musicians the band quickly decided against recruiting a vocalist after hearing the raw might and powerful complexity of the music: thunderous progressive instrumental metal interwoven with elaborate acoustic instrumentation. Soul-smiting heaviness, exotically-composed progressions, intricate passages that range from the neo-celtic to the “Egyptian-esque”—these are just a few elements bubbling in the Dusken cauldron, elements that evoke the spirit and savagery of ancient battlefields, doom-blasted deserts, hoary tundra thundering with the ghosts of primeval gods.  Borean Dusk (Jeff Burnett: bass, Irish bouzouki, octave mandolin; Gunnar Swensen: drums and percussion; John Hardin: electric and acoustic guitar) just released their self-titled debut album in September 2010. Their principal influences are Iron Maiden, Jethro Tull, Mastodon, and traditional European folk.
