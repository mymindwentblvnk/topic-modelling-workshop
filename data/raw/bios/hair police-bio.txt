Working with traditional rock instrumentation as well as electronics, tape manipulation, and oscillators, Hair Police builds demonic walls of sound for a result reminiscent of Throbbing Gristle, early Black Dice, and Wolf Eyes. Hair Police formed in Lexington, KY, in January of 2001. The original lineup included Matt Minter and Ross Compton, but the group soon settled on Mike Connelly (guitar, vocals, tapes, noise), Robert Beatty (electronics), and Trevor Tremaine (drums, vocals, tapes). Soon after forming, the group released its 2001 debut, History of Ghost Dad on Gods of Tundra. Blow Out Your Blood followed on Freedomfrom in 2002, and 2003 found Hair Police in an extremely productive mode that produced Movies: Live '01-'02 (a cassette on Animal Disguise), the Mortuary Servants 7", a self-titled cassette on Hospital Productions, Probe Cutting (a cassette on Gods of Tundra), and splits with Cadaver in Drag and Viki -- the latter of which secured the band its widest distribution. In 2004 Hair Police released a new album, Obedience Cuts, as well as a split with Crystal Fantasy. The following year saw two new albums --Constantly Terrified and Drawn Dead--as well as a reissue of their self-titled album for Hospital Productions on CD. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hair+Police">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
