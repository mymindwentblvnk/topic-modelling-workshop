Rockingham NC, United States (2001 – present)

Terius Youngdell Nash (born June 14, 1978 in Rockingham, North Carolina), better known by his stage name The-Dream, is is a Grammy Award winning American R&B singer-songwriter, producer and Executive Vice President of Island Def Jam Records. In 2007 he released his debut album Love/Hate which spawned three top 20 singles. In 2009 he released his second album, Love vs. Money, which reached #2 on the Billboard 200 and features guest appearances from artists such as Kanye West. In June 2010, his third album, Love King, was released. It peaked at #4 on the Billboard 200.

At the age of two he moved with his mother to Atlanta, Georgia where she raised him until her sudden death at the age of thirty-five. Afterwards, he was taken in by his grandfather, who was an avid music fan. It was through this relationship that he was introduced to many legendary artists that made up his grandfather’s record collection. As soon as he heard the soulful sounds of Sam Cooke and Al Green, The-Dream was hooked. In the third grade he began his musical venture by enrolling in introductory trumpet classes at Grove Park Elementary School. He continued playing the trumpet through high school and later learned to play the drums and guitar.

In junior high and high school his musical influences extended toward such artists such as Timbaland, Missy Elliot, Aaliyah and Tupac Shakur. His talents continued to naturally develop and eventually lead The-Dream to begin producing, singing, rapping and song writing. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Terius+Nash">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
