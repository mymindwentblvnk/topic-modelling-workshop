With shoegaze, postrock and power pop influences, Neuman is known for its pianos, guitars and vocals that merge into a single instrument with a very strong emotional and impressionistic component. Neuman's newest work, Bye Fear / Hi Love, is available as an limited edition vinyl EP. It features Ken Stringfellow (The Posies, REM, Big Star) as a fifth Neuman. Neuman received critical acclaim for their prior releases, including 'Plastic Heaven' (2010) and 'The Family Plot' (2012).
