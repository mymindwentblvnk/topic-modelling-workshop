Born to Armenian parents who immigrated to the U.S. from Lebanon, Bei first got his start DJ'ing at various Los Angeles clubs, where his love of music eventually evolved into production & composition.  In 2008, Bei Ru was featured in The Source Magazine for "Beirut Gangster", his highly praised remix project of Jay-Z's "American Gangster" album.

Bei Ru's newest project--Little Armenia (L.A.)--is a groundbreaking release fusing vintage Armenian music from the 1960's/70's with touches of hip-hop, funk, & soul, released on his own Musa-Ler Music imprint. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bei+Ru">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
