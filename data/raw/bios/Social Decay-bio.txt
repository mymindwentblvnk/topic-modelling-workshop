There are 2 bands with the name Social Decay.

1) Social Decay is New Jersey hardcore band
They released their awesome 7", Life's Not Hard...You're Just Soft, in 1990 on a New Jersey label called Eightball Productions. Probably best song "All I Feel is Pain/Exit" recorded at D.A.C. Studios. Their sound is somewhere between the heavier, Madball-esque side of traditional NYHC and a slightly more metallic crossover edge both musically and in terms of some of the vocal patterns.

New Jersey's Social Decay were in existance from 1983 to 1991 and have since gotten back together in 2008 and plan on recording new material.
