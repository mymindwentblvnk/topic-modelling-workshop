Uzeda is a Sicilian rock group founded in 1987 in Catania, Italy , consisting of lead singer Giovanna Cacciola, guitarists Agostino Tilotta and Giovanni Nicosia, bassist Raffaele Gulisano and drummer Davide Oliveri. Producer Steve Albini recorded four of their records, and significantly contributed to the evolution of their sound: fiery, nervous, sludgy, and unpredictable, with sudden time changes and wild dynamics. Giovanni Nicosia left the band in 1995. After the live tour promoting Different Section Wires, the band went on a lengthy hiatus, while Giovanna Cacciola and Agostino Tilotta formed Bellini, along with drummer Damon Che from Don Caballero. In 2006, Uzeda are back with a new album, Stella. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Uzeda">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
