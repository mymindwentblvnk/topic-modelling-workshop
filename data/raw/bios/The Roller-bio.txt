From Austin, Texas, The Roller is vocalist Mike Morowitz, guitarist Theron Rhoten, bassist Miguel Veliz and drummer Jeremy Jenkins

"Sure, they’re heavy, sure, they’re riffy, and sure, their second album, Wasted Heritage (Cyclopean Records) is four tracks/39 minutes of only the nastiest kind of nasty nastiness, but I think even more than all of that, what strikes me about The Roller is how uncompromising this material is. To imagine these guys coming from the same place as disparate acts like Dixie Witch and The Sword; it’s like the town has multiple personalities. More than that, it’s hard to imagine a place that sees so much sunshine throughout the year could produce music so hateful." - The Obelisk <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Roller">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
