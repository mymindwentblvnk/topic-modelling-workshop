The Grieving Process is a brutal deathcore band from Bayville, New Jersey. The band formed in the summer of 2006 

After nine months of writing and just before they were poised to record the vocals, singer Jay departed, but not having before securing a replacement in No Room In Hell Singer James Van Damm. This easily resolved drama the only blip in an otherwise seamless process, one driven by the bandâ€™s admirable purity of purpose, one inspired by the dedication to songwriting and evolution.

The band released their debut full length album Assimilated Deformation in 2007. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Grieving+Process">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
