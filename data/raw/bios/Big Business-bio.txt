Big Business is a stoner rock / sludge band formed in 2004. Originally from the Seattle area, the band relocated to Los Angeles in February, 2006. The band is currently signed to the record label they formed, Gold Metal.

Big Business is a power trio composed of Jared Warren of Karp, The Whip and Tight Bros From Way Back When, Coady Willis of The Murder City Devils and Dead Low Tide, and as of 2011, Scott Martin of 400 blows.

In 2006, Jared and Coady were asked to join the Melvins who were once again without a bass player after Kevin Rutmanis had been added to the bassist morgue. They recorded A Senile Animal in July 2006, and started a U.S. tour in September with Big Business, among others, opening up. During these shows they were sometimes joined by Melvins drummer Dale Crover on guitar. 

Early 2007 saw the release of Big Business's second full length album Here Come The Waterworks, again on Hydra Head. The album was recorded in Seattle, shortly after they had finished the recordings for A Senile Animal with the Melvins. David Scott Stone - a musician who has often played and recorded with the Melvins - contributes guitar and moog synthesizer on the album.

In 2008 Melvins released a new album, Nude with Boots, which features Jarred and Coady as part of the band, and again on 2010 Melvins release The Bride Screamed Murder. Melvins are currently on tour supporting The Bride Screamed Murder, with Big Business opening for them.
