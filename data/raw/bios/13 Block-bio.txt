13 Block is a French rap group from Sevran (93) which consists of four members, Zefor, Zed, OldPee and Stavo. Before the group was established, Oldpee and Stavo had been in the different group named 'DeTess'. In 2012, Zefor and Zed joined the group, thus the 13 block members were complete. The group is inspired by Chicago's drill and Atlanta's trap.
