DEATHBRINGER - one of the representatives of a rather rare type of music in the post-Soviet space - progressive technical death metal.

The band was formed in the spring of 2002 by the guitarist Artyom Serdyuk.
The initial line-up was:
Artyom Serdyuk – guitars,
Vitaly “Zmey” Silyuk – drums,
Valery Poznyak – bass,
Mitry Molochnikoff – vocals,
Sergey “Sedoy” Kovalenkov – guitars.

DEATHBRINGER started their concert activity in 2003. They have shared the stage with the bands like: VADER, BEHEMOTH, MARDUK, HATE, DEVILYN, SCEPTIC, THY DISEASE, CRIONICS, FRONTSIDE, NEOLITH, PARRICIDE, DEAD INFECTION, KAT, LUNA AD NOCTUM, and many others. 
DEATHBRINGER together with SPAWN OF POSSESSION and MENTAL DEMISE were announced as a support to CANNIBAL CORPSE in Minsk in October 2004. Unfortunately, this gig was cancelled by local authorities half an hour before the show.

In August 2005, the band entered STUDIO-X in Olsztyn (Poland) and recorded the debut album "HOMO DIVISUS". They worked with sound producer Szymon Czech (musician in NYIA, THIRD DEGREE, ANTIGAMA, PROPHECY, etc.), who is well-known for his work with the following bands: DIES IRAE, SCEPTIC, RIVERSIDE, ANTIGAMA, VESANIA, YATTERING, LUX OCCULTA, ENTER CHAOS, PROGHMA-C, DEVILISH IMPRESSIONS and others. As a guest musician on HOMO DIVISUS appeared Jacek Hiro (SCEPTIC, DIES IRAE, VIRGIN SNATCH, DECAPITATED).
In October 2006 DEATHBRINGER performed their first gig outside Belarus, in Poland together with SCEPTIC, THY DISEASE and RASTA.
In summer 2007 the band took part in ROCK TRANSMISSION Festival in Goldap (Poland) with FRONTSIDE, PRAFURIA, EMPATIC, etc., where they won the 2nd place, the audience award, and the awards for "Best Guitarist", "Best Drummer" and "Best Bass Player".

In November 2007 the album "HOMO DIVISUS" was released by the efforts of SOUND AGE PRODUCTIONS (Moscow), and DEATHBRINGER went on polish Rebel Angels Tour 2007 Vol.2, supporting the album, alongside with HATE, CRIONICS and VEDONIST. 
The album was very well-received and got really positive opinions and reviews from all over the world from different metal magazines, webzines and metal portals.

In 2008, the first tour in Belarus took place - "Creative Breath Of Death Tour 2008" together with KATALEPSY, PSILOCYBE LARVAE and THELEMA.
In December 2008, the band went on their first headlining tour "Heads Reaping Tour 2008".
In the first half of 2009 DEATHBRINGER continued to perform at various concerts as a headliner, including a mini tour in Poland and several gigs in Russia and Belarus.

Since 2007 there have been frequent line-up changes and finally Artyom Serdyuk became the only member of the original five, who stayed in the band.
He invited session musicians from Belarus and Poland, and, eventually in the summer of 2009 gathered completely new line-up, consisting mostly of polish members:
ARTYOM SERDYUK – guitars, 
ALEXANDER GORON – bass (studio),
KRZYSZTOF BENDAROWICZ – drums,
MARIO “GONE-TECH” GONTARO BAZALAR – vocals, 
TOMASZ “ZYCLON” WEGLEWSKI – bass (live),
NIKODEM “NIKOS” CIESLUK – guitars.

In 2010 album “HOMO DIVISUS” was re-released by MSR Productions (Moscow).
And in the Spring of 2010 the band went on “Spreading Humanicide Tour 2010” in Poland, Belarus and Lithuania alongside with SCEPTIC, ABUSED MAJESTY and SINFUL CARRION, and with a special guest star on the show in Minsk – MARDUK.
