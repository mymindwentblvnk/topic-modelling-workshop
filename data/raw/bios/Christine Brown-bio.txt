Although born in Frankfurt, Germany, Christine grew up in Colorado, earning a business degree from the University of Colorado. She discovered her love for the piano at an early age, taking piano lessons and accompanying vocal groups at school. Christine was inspired by new age pianists George Winston and Peter Kater in college, but the piano remained a gratifying hobby. She played occasionally, often at weddings for family and friends. However, it was several years later, after the loss of her mother, that she rediscovered her passion for the piano and began composing.

With no formal training in music composition, Christine used the piano to voice emotions and experiences. “Playing the piano is an emotional release, often an escape. To move people with music and to be able to share it with others is truly a joy. My style of composition is sort of classical, sort of new age. I once heard someone describe this piano style as ‘heavy mental’ and I thought it was fairly accurate! Relaxing, yet interesting enough to be introspective.”

In 1991, Christine debuted on a compilation album, “Piano Portraits”, with Sugo Records, and following that, “Summer Stories”. She continues to compose and record her compositions, and has released several CDs, including a Christmas CD and a collection of children’s songs. Christine’s piano music is available at www.CDBaby.com and all major digital download sites, as well as heard on Whisperings Solo Piano Radio at www.solopianoradio.com. Her music is also heard on select Muzak channels, CMS, and Healing Health Care Systems. She resides in the San Diego area with her husband and two sons, who are a source of support and inspiration.
