0) Moredhel: german black metal

1) Moredhel is the soloproject of Jyri Vahvanen, guitar player of the metal band Battlelore

2) Moredhel, the Melbourne six piece melodic death metal outfit, is quickly becoming more popular than guys wearing their sister’s jeans. While building a reputation for spectacular live shows, catchy tunes and swarms of whirling windmills, Moredhel recorded their debut album in 2007 at Complex Studios. Sparing no expense, they hired Dan Swano to mix the album, who is best known for his work with Opeth, Bloodbath & Katatonia.

The 2007 release ‘Metamorphose’ was well received worldwide as a better than above average debut album from a not so well known Australian band.
The year 2007 also saw a line up change for the band where three of the then current six members’ one after the other left the band/ were asked to leave for professional reasons. Each departure frustratingly slowed the bands progress. Yet these hurdles proved to be a blessing in disguise, as each departing member was replaced with a shiny new one. The new models were just as the doctor ordered; leaps and bounds ahead of their respective predecessors.

The new arrangement has allowed the band to take their song writing skills to another level, combining more complex melodic brutality with gracefully brutal melodies. With a new album in the works for early 2009 it is already apparent that Moredhel’s first, Metamorphose, has only just scratched the surface of the bands abilities to write not only a great song, but a captivating album from start to finish. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Moredhel">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
