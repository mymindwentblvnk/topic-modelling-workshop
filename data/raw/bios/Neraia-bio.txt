Neraia was born in autumn 2004. 

The first Demo was released in Feb 2005 and the first work out is the "Beneath A Dying Sunset EP" released in Winter 2005. 
Neraia's songs often outline a cold and dead world. Musically it can be desribed as a melange of various elements of deathmetal, thrashmetal and doom metal. 
But Neraia are solitary people, so they try to use things in a unconvectional way.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Neraia">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
