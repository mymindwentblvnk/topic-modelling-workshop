Jack Colleran (born May 1993), better known as MMOTHS, is an Irish electronic musician.

Colleran was born in Newbridge, County Kildare, Ireland.

Colleran has played piano since he was five years old. He played in several bands while in school and, in 2010, began making music on his laptop using a demo version of Ableton Live. He released the demo on SoundCloud a week later under the stage name MMOTHS. The name is a play on "Motts," a local term for girls. Having released a number of tracks on SoundCloud, MMOTHS was approached by and then signed to Los Angeles music label SQE Music. SQE released his self-titled debut EP in March 2012, which featured guest vocals from Superhumanoids and Keep Shelly In Athens. The EP was described by This Is Fake DIY as "an utterly beautiful blend of electronics that are somehow crafted to evolve with an aching sense of soulful intimacy".

He performed at the South by Southwest festival in April 2012. In August he supported At the Drive-In at the O2 Academy in Brixton, and he has also opened for Aphex Twin.

MMOTHS EP entitled Diaries was released 5 March 2013 and features vocals by Holly Miranda and Young & Sick.
