An impious trio decided to play morbid & malignant black thrash metal by keeping the perversion, death, chaos and satanism without compromise so Persecutory was the name of another death worship that emerged in Ä°stanbul in 2014. Including the bastards Tyrannic Profanator (Sarinvomit, Horrocious) on vocals, Infectious Torment on guitars & bass, and Seismic (Sarinvomit) on drums, they recorded their debut EP "Perversion Feeds Our Force" in 2015. Band recorded 42 minutes of debut full-length between November 2016 - February 2017 with new line-up including Vulgargoat (guitars & back vocals) and A.D.B. (drums). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Persecutory">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
