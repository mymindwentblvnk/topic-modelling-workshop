Behind Them is mainly a one-man-band started on the island of Rhodes, Greece but now located in Hamburg, Germany since 2004.
There are three releases so far from this melodic death/black metal act:

- ''Escape in the dark'' (demo 1999),
- ''Scowling Truth'' (full length 2007)
- ''Promo 2010''

The music is highly inluenced by At The Gates, Dark Tranquillity, (old) In Flames and at times from the fellow countrymen Rotting Christ. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Behind+Them">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
