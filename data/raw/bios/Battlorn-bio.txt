Turkish melodic power/heavy metal band. They released a demo named "Long Way From The Dark". The demo included their single "Minotaur" as well as the other promising songs like "Deepest Cut", "One Ring" and "The Harpers Song". In 2002 they had been announced to front "Blind Guardian" with another Turkish band "Soul Sacrifice". But when the concert organization went as a mess the two bands couldn't see the stage that day. On 04.10.2004, Koray Alarslan (keyboards) and Serkan Ozay (guitars) announced that Battlorn had disbanded. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Battlorn">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
