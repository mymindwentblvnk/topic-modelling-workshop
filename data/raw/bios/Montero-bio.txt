2) Montero are DJ Dee McAuley and producer Graeme L. The pair have been responsible for tracks such as the 'Brazilia e.p' (Renaissance 2004) and the mighty 'Captain Hook', which hit the DJ Mag Hype Chart at No.1 in September 2005 and carried on to be the most downloaded track on DJ Download to date, with heavy support from James Zabiela, Steve Lawler and Nic Fancuilli. 

Their follow-up single 'Hairy Hits' and the ‘Lose Control’ remix of  'Phonique - For The Time Being' also received wide spread acclaim with a No. 5 Buzz Chart entry, No.1 on the downloads and airplay on Pete Tong's Essential Selection. In 2007 they released their electro monsters 48K and ZX on Max Graham’s Re*Brand label, as well as remixing Flash Brothers and Moi Caprice.

Whilst Graeme has an impressive portfolio of productions under his belt with his guises Brass Monkey and Sick Joke, Dee’s past residencies in Ibiza have include Steve Lawler’s Viva nights at Space, Defected at Pacha and of course the infamous Café Mambo, where he spent 3 seasons playing marathon 8 hour sets. With regular appearances at The Cross in London, Trilogy in Dubai, Lush at Kellys in Portrush and Redlight in Paris, Dees worldwide dj schedule also includes cities such as Athens, Moscow, Vilnius and Hong Kong where he is currently based.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Montero">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
