Disolvo Animus is a Hellenic group formed in early 2006. The band’s music is a mix of death metal’s brutality and black metal’s emotional soundscapes. Disolvo’s music is illustrated with symphonic sounds only for the sake of emotion. The basis of the band’s lyrical “wall” is built upon numerous religious and social aspects of life.

The band started as a project by Animus (guitars). After one Demo (Demo 2006), the “Death’s Ruthless Eyes” Promo (Late 2008), one debut EP entitled “Aleatoric Morte” (early 2009) and some line-up changes, Disolvo Animus is now stronger than ever. The new line-up gave rise to a new musical direction for the band. New inspirations were brought up and more complex structures were used.

The outcome of all these changes gave birth to “APHESIS / ΑΦΕΣΙΣ”, Disolvo Animus’ first full length release. It can be best described as an extreme metal album, since all kinds of extreme metal sound were recruited for its composition. It is a concept album, dealing with absolution from sin, a classical theological term of all western religious systems of Christianity.

The album “Aphesis” was recorded at Sound Symmetry studios, under the guidance of Bob Katsionis (Firewind, Outloud). Mixing and mastering were done by Fotis Benardo and Dinos Prasas (Septic Flesh) at Devasoundz studios. The album has guest appearances by Hk (Livarkahil, FR) at the vocals of “Unorthodox Lament”, Astrous (Aenaon, GR) at the vocals of “Illumination”, The Dreamless (Ismini, GR) for all the symphonic parts composed and programmed in the album and Bob Katsionis (Firewind, Outloud, GR) with a guest solo at “Penitential Psalm”. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Disolvo+Animus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
