Formed in the winter of 2007, Train Bigger Monkeys have set out to destroy. With a sound that is, at times, both melodic and punishing, Train Bigger Monkeys have succeeded in creating music that melts faces and blasts minds.

With a wide array of influences from numerous metal genres, it's hard to put a label on TBM, but you can definitely hear death, thrash, progressive, hardcore and black metal all mixed into one bastard child. 

TBM released their debut album “The Human Disgrace” in January of 2012, an album that has been described as a “…ballsy, barking metal album with meaty, dueling guitars.”

“The Human Disgrace” was written by current members Kevin Donovan (Drums), Jason Carter (Guitar) and Alex Dobbins (Guitar), as well as former members Andy Antenucci (Bass), Rick Siedlitz (Guitar), and Brian Abildgaard (Vocals) giving the album a truly well rounded feel.

After sharing the stage with Florida Death metal legends, Massacre, TBM has gone through some lineup changes with new additions of Adam Benito on vocals and Bryce Gorman on bass.

With a full album worth of brand new material and over a year in hiatus, TBM is getting back in the studio and back on the scene.
