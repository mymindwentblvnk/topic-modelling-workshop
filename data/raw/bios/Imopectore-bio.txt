We unite in our sound elements of the 80's traditional heavy metal with doom and black metal elements, adding to these elements female lyric vocals with influence of classic music and torned and grunts vocals in an obscure atmosphere and dark themes. We believe that the union of these elements is exactly where the personality of our music is, and what make us original and peculiar. We always seek the joining among these elements without leaving the 80's metal vein back. The result is what is heard in our first work intitled "Sons of Leviathan". A masterpiece of the dark Metal to the true apreciators of the infernal arts.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Imopectore">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
