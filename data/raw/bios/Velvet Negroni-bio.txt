Velvet Negroni is the alter-ego of creative polymath Jeremy Nutzman. Raised in an outer suburb of the Twin Cities (USA), Jeremy - a black kid adopted into a white evangelical Christian family - split his formative years between classical piano lessons and late night jam sessions. A duality that permeates every corner of his music, thriving in the borderlands between indie rock and R&B. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Velvet+Negroni">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
