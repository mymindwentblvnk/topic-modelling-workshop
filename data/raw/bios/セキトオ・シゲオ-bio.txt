Shigeo Sekito is a Japanese electone player. His first series of professional work was the Special Sound Series which was released in the mid-late 1970s on vinyl.

Shigeo's parents were both primary-school teachers and he has two sisters, both of whom are pianists. Sekito graduated from Osaka Kyoiku University's Special Music Course Composition Department. According to the New Straits Times, Sekito had released ten albums by 1991 and averaged two concerts per month, using the rest of his time to teach piano to students. 

Sekito made an appearance at Dewan Merdeka in the Putra World Trade Centre in 1991 and played with an EL 90 Electone, rearranging pieces made by Mozart and Beethoven. The concert was attended by one thousand individuals for one hour and a screen placed above the concert allowed the audience to watch Sekito play. Sekito started the event off by playing Concierto de Aranjuez by Joaqu√≠n Rodrigo rearranging it in classical style.

Musician Mac DeMarco based his track "Chamber of Reflection" on Sekito's Special Sound Series Vol. 2 song The Word II. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/%E3%82%BB%E3%82%AD%E3%83%88%E3%82%AA%E3%83%BB%E3%82%B7%E3%82%B2%E3%82%AA">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
