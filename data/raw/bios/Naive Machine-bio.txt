Naive, also know as Dave Pilcher was born in the States in a backward town near Tulsa, Oklahoma, although at the age of one his parents moved over to the UK near Brighton where he picked up his love for music.

After years of producing beats for the countries best emcees and his crew Tactical Thinking, Naive has stepped out of the shadows and teamed up with long term collaborator Jim O'Regan to form the new Naive Machine project. To let the instrumentals take centre stage while retaining the cut-and-paste aesthetic developed from a lifetime of crate digging and sampling, the new project showcases a more synthesized, electronic and fun sound. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Naive+Machine">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
