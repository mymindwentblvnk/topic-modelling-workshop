L. Pierre is Aidan Moffat's solo work in electronic music. After former Arab Strap band-mate Malcolm Middleton challenged him to release a solo album, Moffat rose to the challenge and released Hypnogogia under the name Lucky Pierre. In 2005, after changing the name to "L. Pierre", Moffat released an album called Touchpool. At the end of 2005 he also released the single "I Hate T-shirts That Say 1977" together with the rapper Notes. His latest solo album was released in 2013, and is titled "The Island Come True".
