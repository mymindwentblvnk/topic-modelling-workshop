JR Ewing was a hardcore/post-hardcore band from Oslo, Norway.

The name JR Ewing is from the tv series «Dallas».
JR Ewing started up in 1998, and never had any intention of becoming as big as they did. They recorded a single that led to the following European tour. As the years went by, they achieved a certain degree of success, but in early 2006, they decided to call it a day, and the band split up.

They released 3 albums during their existence, "Calling in Dead" (2000), "Ride Paranoia" (2003) and "Maelstrom" (2005).
