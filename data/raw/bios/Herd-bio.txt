There couldn’t be more happening right now for three times Subliminal artist Jason Herd. DJMag’s November issue will hold a cover mount CD of his latest productions on his JFunk Recordings label, demonstrating why he leads the way forward in house music showing how JFunk has evolved from an outlet for his own releases to one of the most talked about, vocal house labels at this time.

Previously more commonly known for his worldwide smash Herd & Fitz “I Just Can’t Get Enough”, Jason now joins the ranks alongside Laidback Luke, Fedde Le Grand and Axwell with his new direction of vocal, but big room house music. Forthcoming releases include top vocalists Lisa Millett, Steve Edwards and Roland Clarke, whilst his current xxx-rated track “My Girl” has reached anthemic levels and has been smashing dancefloors everywhere resulting in it being snapped up and due for a full commercial release in its clean version. Meanwhile his tech house/techno alter ego Juan Kidd has releases forthcoming on Toolroom and Azuli for those darker floors.

Jason is one of the UK’s most respected House DJs and has gained residencies at Gods Kitchen, Sankeys, Gatecrasher and has more recently added his name to the Warehouse Project line-up. Whilst house is his main genre, he often swings towards vocals or to the underground, depending on what the crowd are going for.
