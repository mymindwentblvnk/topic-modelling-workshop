Forged in bleak January 2005, handpicking the cream of metal talent from around the Midlands, it was but a few months before Rue the Day had penned a scintillating set, cut their first single and were embarking on a string of dates across the UK.

At that point still performing under their original moniker From the Ashes, the fiery 5-piece brought their frenetic brand of passionate, powerful melodic metal to ever increasing crowds at the likes of the Oxford Zodiac, The Underground Student Union in Birmingham, Coventry Colosseum and the Camden Purple Turtle.

Early 2008 and Rue The Day are immersing themselves into a burgeoning metal scene; leading the charge of fresh British thrash talent. Unleashing their debut album on Casket Records and selling out online within the first day of release alongside glowing press coverage (‘Big Cheese Magazine’ rating the album 5/5), a September UK tour and big budget film soundtrack with Oceanstorm’s ‘Hotel Caledonia’ (starring Kris Marshall and Kelly Brook) beckon.

Recently back from a successful tour of Eastern Europe, concluding in a headline slot at the Party in the Prague Festival, Rue The Day’s music has featured on MTV 2's Headbangers Ball, a ‘history of thrash’ Big Cheese covermount CD and a number of extreme sports films - while the band themselves have ripped apart a string of high-profile venues; Camden Underworld, Oxford Zodiac and the Birmingham Barfly to name but a few.
