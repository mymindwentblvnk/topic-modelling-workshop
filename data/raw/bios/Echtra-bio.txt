There is more than one artist with this name:

1) Echtra is a black metal/ritual ambient band formed in 2003 in Olympia, WA, United States.

The hero's journey par excellence, Echtra represents the transition between this world and the others. A seed, carried as close to one's heart as spatiality will allow, germinates rebirth and a nomadic wandering no longer bound. A symbiosis of brown, green, and red; the saturation of the grey with the vibrant shades of being: these are the transformations made possible when the otherworld reasserts itself unexpectedly. An immersion in the deep past reveals the portal through which the Soul may emerge unscathed, as an unqualified rejection of the mundane bog of modernity loosens the chains. The adventitious dross of this age sloughs off, revealing the unheralded spectral interior light, and all swirls around the spirit in its adventure towards Home.

Related projects include Fauna, Threnos, Fearthainne, and Alethes.

2) Echtra is an electronic band from Asturias, Spain.
Inspired by lords as George Romero, Max Brooks, Goblin or Zombie Zombie; Echtra starts as a sonorous experiment to discover with its music, apocalypse, shadows, primitive... something like the soundtrack of the end of the world.
A brilliant project around the krautrock, the electro and the psychedelic rhythms. A band of vintage synths and solanum lovers that will transport you to the catharsis.
