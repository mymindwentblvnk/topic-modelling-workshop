Sugar For Sugar is an indie pop band fronted by actress and singer Scarlett Johansson, with Julia Haltigan, Holly Miranda and Kendra Morris. 

Originally formed as The Singles with Este Haim as their 5th member, the band was forced to change their name shortly after releasing their first single Candy, as established rockers The Singles filed a lawsuit against the group for using the same moniker. The band then re-formed as Sugar For Sugar, minus Haim.  

In 2016, a cover of New Orderâ€™s Bizarre Love Triangle was featured on the charity compilation The Time Is Now!, benefitting amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sugar+For+Sugar">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
