AGENTZ was formed by bassist Jose Ferro upon his return from a British tour in August, 1984. Jose recruited ex-Savatage member Patrick Dubs as lead vocalist for the project, on which they as a team collaborated on writing an assortment of very new and very original material.

Several members have come and gone in those years, but perseverance was a strong point between the partnership. In 1985, Jose and Patrick had finally found the right combination to complete the alliance. Along with Tommy Tindall, John Cappadona and Jason Sabo, ‘AGENTZ’ was complete. The band played various shows with major recording acts such as Geffen Recording artist ‘Adam Bomb’, Atlantic Recording artist ‘Savatage’ and ‘Kix’, and Polygram’s ‘Cinderella’. 

In 1985, the band had recorded a five-song demo, which had been played over several radio stations in Europe. This created a lot of interest in ‘AGENTZ’. They were reviewed in many magazines such as Metal Forces, Kerrang and Burn from Japan, in which their demo tape received rave reviews. 

In 1986, they signed with Dream Records/CBS in France. The album “Stick to your Guns” was released in Europe in April 1987. This album was never released in a CD format. 

Until now.

Original Agentz records are in demand, and selling at prices upwards of $100 US dollars. After much interest and contact from many fans wanting to hear more and those who simply want the CD, Jose has decided to digitally re-master the original Agentz album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Agentz">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
