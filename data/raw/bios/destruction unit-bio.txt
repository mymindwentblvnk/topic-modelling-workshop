Being the brainchild of Ryan Rousseau (Reatards, The Wongs, Tokyo Electron), Destruction Unit is a Sonoran Desert based psychedelic noise punk band. Having built a reputation for terrorizing crowds with sheer noise power and reckless behavior, they have been described as "a band who felt more like a horror movie than a band ... With guitars that were distorted beyond belief and acted more as auxiliary noise machines than instruments" (Transmission Entertainment) and "Suicide-meets-Chrome-meets-Hawkwind-meets-Screamers-meets-the-killer-last-scene-reveals-in-all-the-alien-episodes-of-The Twilight Zone" (LA Weekly) and "punk rock" (Austin Town Hall). The current lineup features R. Rousseau on Guitar and Vocals, brother Rusty Rousseau (Digital Leather) on bass, N. Nappa (Marshstepper, Nihilism) on Guitar, J. Aurelius (Pigeon Religion, Avon Ladies, Marshstepper) on Guitar and Andrew Flores AKA "Jock Club" on drums (Ex.Drummer: J. Keefer (Naive)). 

The band originated in the early 2000's and featured R. Rousseau with Jay Reatard (Reatards, Lost Sounds, Angry Angles) and Alicja Trout (Lost Sounds, Black Sunday). The three appeared together on the first release, 2000's My Disease 7", as well as the 2006 record Death To The Old Flesh and Destruction Unit's debut LP, Self Destruction of a Man. Destruction Unit were featured on the Screamers tribute The Necessary Effect, Screamers Songs Interpreted.
