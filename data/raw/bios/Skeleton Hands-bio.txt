As the moon shone down into the deep, cavernous landscape so did Skeleton Hands; when two pioneers of the outer reaches came together to conquer the dark and the light. Skeleton Hands is comprised of only two, Lazer Bat, master of rhythm, atmosphere, and words; and Astro Wolf, an axe-wielding, melodic beast of prey who gets his powers from the moon. However, together they concoct a sound reminiscent of both the pioneers of electronic music as well as the post-punk movement all with a joyful darkness that rumbles the floor and circles the atmosphere. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Skeleton+Hands">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
