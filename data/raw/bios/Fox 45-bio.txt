From Rochester, NY.
Fox 45 was formed in April 2013, originally by Pauline Coles, Amanda Rampe and Vicky Tee.  
We tried to pull our many musical influences, such as Black Sabbath, Sleep, The Sword, Mountain, L7, The Cramps and Bikini Kill together, and create our own musical niche.  And we were successful.
We recorded our fist E.P. in February 2014 at Watchmen Studios.
