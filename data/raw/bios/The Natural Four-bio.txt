Formed in 1967, the Natural Four first signed with a local Oakland label, Boola Boola Records. The first 45 release was "I Thought you were mine" A side b/w "You Did This for Me". "I Thought you were mine" sold 30,000 locally as it was played on KDIA where it rose to #7 on the chart. "Why Should We Stop Now", was the next 45 which also had the "You Did This for Me" b side. ABC Records saw potential in "Why Should We Stop Now", and picked up the group, it charted nationally in 1969. ABC then released "The Same Thing in Mind", a remake of their first hit "I Thought You Were Mine", and a cover of [The Temptations]' "Message From a Black Man", but none of them were as successful as the Boola Boola "I Thought you were mine" and ABC dropped the group.
Chess Records released their single "Give a Little Love" in 1971, and following this lead singer Chris James replaced the rest of the band with an entirely new crew. In 1972, they signed with Curtis Mayfield's label, Curtom Records, and proceeded to release a string of US R and B hits, including one Top 40 breakthrough, 1974's "Can This Be Real". Their three Curtom LPs were produced by Leroy Hutson of The Impressions, but after their third release failed to chart, the group called it quits. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Natural+Four">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
