In October 2008, Pale Young Gentlemen released the follow-up to their self-titled debut. Musically and emotionally expansive, Black Forest (tra la la) is distinct from their previous release. Trading the bouncy piano and old dancehall beats for finger-plucked guitar and quivering strings, Pale Young Gentlemen craft a unique and uncompromising musical vision--a stirring sprawling 43 minutes.

As with their debut, Black Forest was recorded at Smart Studios in the band’s hometown of Madison, Wisconsin and produced by Beau Sorenson (Death Cab For Cutie, Sparklehorse). Recorded and mixed in less than two weeks, Black Forest is Pale Young Gentlemen’s first release with Madison-based label Science of Sound.

Pale Young Gentlemen currently consist of:

Mike Reisenauer- vocals, guitar, piano
Matt Reisenauer- percussion
Brett Randall- bass
Beth Morgan- cello
Gwen Miller- viola, bells
