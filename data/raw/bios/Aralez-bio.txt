Aralez was founded July 2012, in Dresden where 4 musicians from diferrent regions of Germany and Armenia joined for music.
Aralez, being a mixture of Armenian and Saxonian rock, stays true to the original character of their music, in this case Armenian-German dark-psychodelic and melancholic style.
After working a year , Aralez recorded their first album – “Licking Wounds”, which is a perfect assembly of folk, rock, and dark-psychodelic metal, completed with the specific oriental female vocals and dark cold male screaming.
