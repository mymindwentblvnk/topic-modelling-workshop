Mass Hypnosis is a band that combines extreme music genres, predominantly industrial metal. The band was formed in the year of 2006. as a project which included several renowned Croatian metal artists, who already had an extensive stage and studio experience known for their earlier work in bands such as Forlorn Legacy, The Rite of Retaliation, Kavorka and Intoxicate. From the ideological point of view, Mass Hypnosis stands „on par“ with socio-political subjects like modern-age slavery, conspiracy theories, media manipulation, religion, war and other shortcomings of today's world. The original name of the project was ''This Mortal Coil'', which was followed by ''Deadweight Loss'', but after a few performances, they decided to turn the project into a "real" band and to devote their imagination, creative ideas, energy and passion for extreme music. Considering their lyrics, band’s iconography and their life philosophy, they all agreed upon the name ''MASS HYPNOSIS''.
