Godless North is one of Canada's oldest and most respected Black Metal bands in the underground. The band comes from Vancouver, British Columbia and was formed in 1996 by Othalaz. Joined by drummer Oblak Ilking they recorded their magnum opus Summon the Age of Supremacy during 1999 and 2000. It was released through Breath of Night in March 2001 and eventually on vinyl LP on Sombre Records. The band also participated on Sombre's Black Metal Endsieg II 7" split with Nargaroth, Decayed and Apolokia and later on 12" split Only Human Ashes Are Real... with french Chemin de Haine.
In 2003 the band was put to rest and was resurrected by Othalaz in 2008. Time slowly passed on and in 2012 he finally found suitable persons to fill in a line-up, joined by Albrecht on bass and Impudicus (Ordinance, Totalselfhatred, Night Must Fall...) on drums. This line-up is to record the new EP titled "World in Flames" which is to be released by Darker Than Black. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Godless+North">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
