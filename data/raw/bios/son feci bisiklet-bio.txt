Son Feci Bisiklet is an alternative/indie rock band formed in Ankara, Turkey in 2011 by Arda Kemirgent (vocal, guitar) and Can Sürmen (drums). The first EP, recorded by the duo, titled Son Feci EP, came out in 2014. Quickly making a name for themselves in the Turkish music scene, the duo added Efe Güner (bass guitar) and Erkin Sağsen (guitar) to their roster. After four singles, the band released their debut album, Vesaire, in 2015. Bu Kız and Pazar Ve Ertesi especially gained widespread popularity throughout the country.  2016 saw the release of only 3 new singles throughout the year, due to the lead singer Arda Kemirgent going into involuntary military service. After his service, the band recorded and released Kötü Şeyler in 2017. Altough not a huge departure from their previous sound, the band experimented with new styles and concepts. Two new singles were released in 2018 and the band had a quiet 2019, not releasing any recorded work. February 2020 saw the release of their third LP, Sistemik. They are known for their inventive and catchy sound and relentless touring schedules. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/son+feci+bisiklet">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
