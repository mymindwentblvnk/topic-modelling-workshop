A|SYMMETRY
progressive/power metal
Belgrade, Serbia

A five piece progressive/power metal act A|SYMMETRY started its journey in 2006 as a studio project with first demos recorded in 2007, but the real thing happened in 2011 when rehearsals with full band began, so the old songs got new shape and sound. With old friends from progressive metal band Burning Circle, Aleksandar and Radomir onboard the A|symmetry puzzle was complete. The end of year 2012 remarks release of EP “Room 17: Hours Between Shadows and Light” which received very positive critics and made successful debut.

After more than two years of working on new songs band started recording its first full-length album by the name of “Fragility”. In the meantime, Aleksandar's and Radomir's other band Burning Circle released EP called "Aral Sea" (with a song with the same name) and band felt that this topic was so great that they decided to work further on a story that became a concept album. 

"Fragility" is a fictional story about fate of a man from Aralsk whose life shared same destiny with the shrinking lake (Aral Sea). It is a musical and lyrical journey that describes a struggle of millions of people trapped in a world ruled by dictators, corruption, twisted forms of leadership, malfunctions of society, wars, revolution and evolution of society, as well as a critique of both "Eastern" and "Western" way of life. It is also a story about tremendous effect of mankind on environment and horrible things that we as a species do to the nature. 

Album features guest appearance of Linus Abrahamson (Andromeda, Edge Of A Circle, Metal Station, Nonexist) on lead and acoustic guitars, as well as Dusan Svilokos (Trigger) and Johan Reinholdz (Andromeda, Nonexist, Skyfire) on solo guitar.

"Fragility" is recorded at RevolverStudio Novi Sad with Dragan Panjak as engineer. Mix and master is done by Vedran Kovacic of Chicken Sound Studio in Zagreb. Artwork was created by Ani Artworks who worked with bands Soundcrawler, Hero’s Fate, Serdce, among others.
