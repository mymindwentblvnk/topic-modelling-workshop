Brothers of Conquest was a horror-themed heavy metal band, the side project of Adam "The Outlaw of Rock n' Roll" Neal (vocals) of Nashville Pussy, and Rodney Rhoads (bass) and Ian Spiders (guitar) from The Hookers. Tony Rivers (guitar) and ZZ Priest (drums) rounded out the lineup.  Brothers of Conquest were only together long enough to release one album, "All the Colors of Darkness" (2002)..  After the band split, Adam Neal and Rodney Roads formed a new band called Blade of the Ripper. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Brothers+of+Conquest">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
