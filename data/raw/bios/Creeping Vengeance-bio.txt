The Band was founded in 1999 by Mauro (Guitars) and Matthias (Drums). After the first steps, motivated people interested in joining the band were quickly found. In the following, rather unproductive stage it was soon proved to be that the interests of the new members, concerning the stylistic direction of the Band, were different. So Mauro and Matthias were again alone.

But new members didn`t wait to show up and Urs (Guitar), Simon (Bass) and Lo√Øc (Vocals) joined the Band to form the first definite Line-Up. In this constellation, the first songs were written and then presented to an audience on the first concert of CREEPING VENGEANCE on 28.04.01. After that, more concerts in the Swiss Underground followed which won more and more popularity.

In the same year, the Band felt ready to record its first CD. Thus, the 6-Track CD Fury Unleashed was recorded in the Subsounz Studio in Biel and released in spring 2002.

After the release of Fury Unleashed, more successful concerts with several Swiss Bands as well as with international headliners followed, i.e. with PROFANITY (D), PHOBIA (US), KINGS EVIL (J), SPAWN OF POSSESSION (SWE) and SUFFOCATION (US).

In summer 2004, our bass player Simon unfortunately had to leave the Band since he`s now a happy father. We found a very motivated replacement in Oli who was the producer of Fury Unleashed back in 2001.

At this stage, the Band has released its first full lenght album called The Diary which contains 9 songs plus an intro, a video clip to The Haunted Mind (Fury Unleashed 2002) and a live clip. Recorder and engineer of the album was no one other than Serge Spiga (CREMATION). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Creeping+Vengeance">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
