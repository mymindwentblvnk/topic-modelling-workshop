HARDCORE / PUNK band from the Basque Country (Spain). The band started in 1989 playing punk-rock but quickly they became a more hardcore band oriented. 8 years after the band changed to sounds more THRASH and METAL oriented, but with the same politics lyrics. In 1999 the band disbanded. Currently (2013) the band has returned and lives in Ermua, a little village in Basque Country. Probably it will be a new CD soon.
