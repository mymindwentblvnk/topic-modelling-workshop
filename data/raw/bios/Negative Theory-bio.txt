Negative Theory started under a different name and had gone through a couple others, due to the various lineup changes. Until the perfect lineup was constructed. Where two insane guitar players from Altoona, PA met up with one evil prophet from Buffalo, NY and a psycho from Pittsburgh, PA who just happened to own a drumset.

Their goal... to create the most surrealistic, heaviest style of music they could. Calling it "sludgecore".

Their roots ranging from EyeHateGod to V.O.D. to Miles Davis to Helmet.

We are proud to represent Pittsburgh's music scene, especially when the only thing were recognized for is pretty boy rock like...... well you know who they are.

Between the stage presence and the music, we personally guarantee that if you are into heavy music of any style you'll be into our musical band of guerrillas. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Negative+Theory">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
