Cherry Glazerr is an American rock band from Los Angeles, California, formed in 2013.
The current lineup consists of guitarist and lead vocalist Clementine Creevy, bassist Devin O'Brien and drummer Tabor Allen. The band's sound has transitioned from lo-fi, garage-rock in their debut release Haxel Princess in 2014, to a more polished rock sound, with elements of grunge punk and new wave, in their sophomore release Apocalipstick in 2017.

The band has undergone a number of lineup changes since its inception. In 2015, Hannah Uribe left the band in pursuit of other artistic projects. In 2015, Cherry Glazerr saw the addition of two new musicians: multi-instrumentalist Sasami Ashworth on synths, who was invited to join the band by Sean Redman, and drummer Tabor Allen, who was subsequently invited to join the band by Ashworth. In mid-2016, and after participating in the recording of Apocalipstick, Redman departed and became a full-time member of his other band The Buttertones. He was replaced by bassist Devin O'Brien in 2017. In January 2018, Cherry Glazerr announced that Sasami Ashworth had left the band in order to concentrate on her own musical projects.

In November 2018, Cherry Glazerr announced their new album Stuffed & Ready. It was released on February 1, 2019. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cherry+Glazerr">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
