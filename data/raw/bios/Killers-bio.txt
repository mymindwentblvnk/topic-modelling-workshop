2. Killers (also known as Paul Di'Anno's Killers,was formed back in the summer of 1991 by Paul Di'Anno and Cliff Evans.

Paul Di'Anno's Killers are a Heavy metal band founded in 1992 by famous vocalist Paul Di'Anno (ex-Iron Maiden, Battlezone). Cliff Evans was living in New York with the manager of Fastway. Steve Hopgood, who played in Battlezone with Paul called him and said “Let’s get something together”. Paul was contacted and he flew over to New York where they formed a band.

Within a few days they had hired John Gallagher (from Raven) to play bass on a short-term basis and an American, Ray De Tone, on second guitar. Within a few days, a live album called "South American Assault Live" was recorded, featuring a number of Iron Maiden and Battlezone tracks and covers of "We Will Rock You" and "Smoke on the Water". This was recorded primarily for the South American market, as a South American "money guy" was involved who was interested in backing a tour in the region[3]. "Recorded in Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela in Summer of 1993" is splashed on the back cover. However, according to John Gallagher, the entire album was played in a New York rehearsal hall and taped on a mobile recording truck [4]. Later, a Canada-based record company called Magnetic Air Productions was to issue a pirate release worldwide, under a different cover, with no royalties being paid to the band.

Killers then played a showcase for several major record companies includin Virgin, EMI, Sony and BMG. Representatives flew into New York from all over the world to see Killers play. They played only Iron Maiden songs because the band hadn't written any material. Maiden songs played included “Phantom Of The Opera” and ”Wratchild” which evidently impressed a BMG representative enough to give the band a $250,000 contract. BMG were unaware that these songs had been recorded previously.

Once Killers had the record deal they started to write the first album entitled "Murder One". The band moved to a studio upstate of New York "in the middle of nowhere". They stayed in a motel in which the owner had a set up rehearsal studio. The album was written in about in two weeks. It took only a further month to get it recorded.

After a spell in Jail, Paul Di'Anno returned to the UK after being deported. It was here that he signed the band to Bleeding Hearts records located in Newcastle. Here the band were to record their second studio album entitled "Menace To Society". With a forced Pantera-like style it was poorly recieved by the critics with the exception of Metal Hammer magazine in Germany who voted it as the "Best New Album" for that year.

Later, Paul and Cliff were to tour as the only original members of Killers left. Steve had to retire as he developed tinnitus in his ears. The guitarist Graham Bath damaged his hands from playing so much over the years and developed arthritis. Paul then hired new musicians who he remembered from touring in German and Austria. According to Di'Anno he had wanted Clive Burr (ex-Iron Maiden) to drum but he couldn't get to rehearsals in time. However, later on Clive was to become severely ill from Multiple Sclerosis.

By 2004, Killers had disbanded. Cliff Evans, the former Killers guitarist and last original member of the band apart from Di'Anno, subsequently formed his own record company called Soundhouse Records and re-released the entire Killers back catalogue with the addition of another live album entitled Killers Live at the Marquee in 2008. Murder One album was reissued with 2 acoustic bonus tracks – "Wrathchild" and "Dreamkeeper". Following this, Paul Di'Anno made both Killers studio albums available for download free of charge through his own website. Following legal action, Evans was forced to cease selling any Killers material on his label.

In December 2013, Paul Di'Anno and Cliff Evans announced that the band would regroup and release a new album entitled The Lazarus Syndrome. Producer Phil Kinmanm who had worked on Tank's album War Nation was announced to be involved with the new project.
