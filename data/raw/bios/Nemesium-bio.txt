5 piece extreme metal band from Geelong, formed from the ashes of bands including Dawn of Retribution, Haxan, Intrepid, Dominaeon and Befallen.

Converging as one to fill a void in the sonic landscape of Australian metal.

Inspired by the old guard of extreme metal bands, with a sprinkling of modern influences and a healthy dose of melodic riffage. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nemesium">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
