In the span of two albums, «Eveil Hardcore» & «Renaissance», Breed Machine managed to affirm its particular sound and style: a powerful metal with crushing groovy rhythms and raging vocals in an oppressive atmosphere. It has been said several times that Breed Machine gives the listener no recess...

Beginning of 2011, Breed Machine is back with a new studio album called «3». And the sobriety of such an album name opposes its content. Here Breed Machine continues to produce thrash/hardcore anthems next to direct and violent songs, but the band also experiments more in depth with dark and disturbing atmospheres. Thanks to all these different approaches, Breed Machine delivers a complete album which mixes brutality, radical mosh parts and a melodic touch. Still the 4 members of the band continue to do what they do best: create catchy songs tailored for live performance.

As for «Renaissance» & «Eveil Hardcore», «3» was recorded, mixed and mastered at the Studio NSR by Laurent Nafissi and Breed Machine between September and December 2010. The cover artwork -an ichtyocentaurus fighting a sea snake- was directed by the band's long time associated artist Joolz. Released in March 2011, «3» contains 16 tracks and is presented in a Digipack format.
