Another name used by the members of The Future Sound of London, originally used to release experimental techno material on the album Tales of Ephidrina (1993), which was released between Accelerator (1992) and Lifeforms (1994).

More recently they have used the name for a change in musical direction away from the pure electronica sound using synths and computers to the use of real instruments and a softer more psychedelic electronic tone for The Isness. That album came with a sticker on the front which said "The Future Sound of London presents Amorphous Androgynous." In 2005 the album Alice In Ultraland was released, moving even further in the real instrument direction, but still retains a psychedelic electronic sound.

In 2008 a new album entitled The Peppermint Tree and Seeds of Superconsciousness was released. The album retains the same sound as in the previous two albums. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Amorphous+Androgynous">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
