Moshcircus was formed in January 2002 in Hamm, Germany. Very quickly afterwards the first demo "CLEAN YOUR SOUL" was recorded in March 2002. The band began to play some club gigs and started to spill their own brand of metal - BLOODMETAL! After a bunch of successful live shows Moshcircus decided to keep the momentum they had gained by once again entering the studio and recorded the second demo CD "FLESH OF GODS" in September 2004! This release earned a lot of reputation and some very good feedback from the press, i.e. the highly renowned german magazine ROCK HARD went on to say "[...] perfect groovy Ami-stuff intertwined with oldschool Thrash [...] explosive screams and melodic vocals [...] a perfect mix of Soulfly and Atreyu [...]"! A lot of shows followed and the second demo CD went on to become a huge underground success for Moshcircus!

In the year 2005 the band relocated to Dortmund, Germany and ultimately bass player Marcus Müller joined the band. By the end of 2005 together they entered the studio and recorded a complete album of 11 songs - called "KARMA"! In 2006 - after the record was ready produced - they started a self organized tour through Germany.

Immediately following this experience second guitar player and background singer Denis Große of Toxic Roots fame joined the band - now Moshcircus was formed stronger than ever! A lot of most intense live performances and festival appearances of BLOODMETAL reign followed and once again the underground was conquered! During this time MOSHCIRCUS made a couple of good friends (i.e. Neaera, Crosscut, Caliban, Delirious) who got totally infected by KARMA! 
Thus MOSHCIRCUS released a 4 track CD simply called "BLOODMETAL"!
