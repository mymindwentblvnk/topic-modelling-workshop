[1] - The Drift are an instrumental band based in San Francisco, California comprised of Tarentel founding member Danny Paul Grody, Rich Douthit, and Trevor Montgomery.  Their music draws upon elements of dub, rock, minimalism, and abstract leanings that combine to create a sound uniquely their own.

Since forming in 2002 the band has released two full lengths (a third on it's way) and a host of singles to critical acclaim.  They have toured extensively in the US, Canada, Europe, and Japan. Over those years the band has had the honor of working with upright bassist Safa Shokrai(2005-08) and trumpet player Jeff Jacobs who joined shortly after the band formed in 2003. Jeff succumbed to a long and courageous battle with cancer in early January 2011.  The dedication he gave to music and the band’s development was paramount.  He will be greatly missed, but his light shines eternally.
