The band was formed in 2005 in a small town called Pozega by a group of friends who played blowing instruments and wanted to create a new mixture of music. They found a drummer,guitarists and that piano guy:D. They started to play covers and they remixed them in a new genre of music. They are playing metal but also have blowing instruments like trumpets,trombone,french horn and tuba and mix it all together. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/We+Come+One">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
