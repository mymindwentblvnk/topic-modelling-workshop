Noctiferum was founded in 2006 by [exbandmember]Pestilenz[/exbandmember] in Vienna, but was later taken over by Sargatanas. [exbandmember]NoA[/exbandmember] played bass and wrote the lyrics up to the "Serenades of the Impure" demo. There is no official drummer. The current line-up is:
E.X. — Vocals
Sargatanas — Lead guitar, backing vocals

Noctiferum started as Black Metal but in time became increasingly sophisticated; the demo "Serenades of the Impure" — which was written in 2007 — is relatively primitive but in the upcoming debut album "A Deo non Est" Post-Rock influences become apparent and the band sheds its dirty old skin. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Noctiferum">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
