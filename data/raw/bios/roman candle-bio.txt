Roman Candle formed in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States in 1997. Roman Candle's flexible, soulful sound stretches from the alt-country of bands like Golden Smog and the Old 97's to the loose, confident country sounds of classic rock bands like the Band and the Rolling Stones. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Roman+Candle">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
