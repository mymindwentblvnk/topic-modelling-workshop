Described as a melodic yet violent take on progressive metal, The River Neva has provided a fresh outlook on the genre with their debut Ep "Chemistry of Holocaust". It is clear that their thrash and progressive roots are on display in spades on "Holocaust" as Neva finds a way to create a roiling blend of catchy melodic progressions and furious brutality that produces a flawless taste of metal goodness that will make any fan of heavy music salivate. The collaboration between Neva and producer/engineer Rob Gil (who also worked with Hatebreed, Shadows Fall, and Unearth) is a match made in metal heaven as the songs are crafted masterfully and the sonic onslaught only leaves the listener craving more. Ettore Rigotti's (Disarmonia Mundi, Destrage, Rise to Fall) mastering provides a distinct European flavor that makes the sound complete and chaotically unique.

The River Neva is comprised of five veterans of the Massachusetts metal scene and have made a name for themselves amongst peers and metalheads alike across the region. Having yet to unleash "Holocaust" on the world they have been previewing their wares live accompanied by an unmatched stage presence that enraptures audiences. The force of The River Neva dispenses effects of despair, anguish, and total infatuation, and draws you nearer. Taste a dark melodic metal progression unlike anything else you've experienced. The River Neva shows us that keeping it simple is an atrocity and induces violence in their wake. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+River+Neva">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
