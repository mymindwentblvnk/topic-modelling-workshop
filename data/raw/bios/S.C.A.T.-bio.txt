S.C.A.T. is a goregrind band formed in the west part of Russia (Bryansk) in the summer of 2006. At first there were some problems with the band’s line-up. Only in 2008 the band began the active rehearsals. The first work [EP] “Kill the Swine!” was recorded and self-released in the beginning of 2009 after some local shows in the period of summer-autumn 2008.

In the beginning of 2009 a free singer joined the band and added more sick ideas to the music and lives shows. During 2009 S.C.A.T. has taken part in festivals and gigs in Russia and Ukraine. In the summer of 2009 the band went to the studio to record the new stuff called "Stench of Corpse Anal Tract". At the end of 2009 it was released at 2-way Split CD with CHOKED BY OWN VOMITS by RottenRollRex.

Later the band had difficulties with a drummer (he served in the RF Army). In the autumn of 2010, when the drummer returned, S.C.A.T. went to the studio again and started recording of the debut album "Apopatophobia". It was put out by Coyote Records in March 2011. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/S.C.A.T.">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
