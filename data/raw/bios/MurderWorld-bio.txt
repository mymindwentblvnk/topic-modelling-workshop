Rising out of the ashes of several dead and buried metal acts comes a lethal combination, a brutal force, and the desire to shred. A sound dominated by the aggressive vocal delivery of singer/guitarist Morbid Matt is driven by the tight and precise punctuation of drummer Zac Sale, who compliments the chaotic shredding guitar work of Shayne Querruel and Matt with deadly accuracy. A low end rumble completes the sound courtesy of bassist Kaill.

Thrashing beats and lightning fast rhythms provide the template for the spewing forth of hatred, contemplative thoughts about corruption of relgion and government and the human condition. It is the ferocious bass work, shredding guitars, powerful drums, blistering leads and howling vocals that all adds up to make MurderWorld...
