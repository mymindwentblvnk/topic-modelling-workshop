The Tuss is an electronic music project by Richard D. James of Aphex Twin fame. Before the official reveal of Richard D. James as being The Tuss, it was originally theorized that The Tuss was a group consisting of Cornish musicians Brian Tregaskin and Karen Tregaskin. So far The Tuss's releases are an EP, "Confederation Trough" and an album, "Rushup Edge". Both have been released on Rephlex in 2007. 

In July 2017,  seven new tracks were added to "Rushup Edge", and can be found here : https://aphextwin.warp.net/release/86013-the-tuss-rushup-edge-
