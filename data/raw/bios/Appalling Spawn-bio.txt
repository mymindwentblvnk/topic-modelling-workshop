Appalling Spawn was the precursor to Lykathea Aflame. After the drummer Gabriel left, the rest of the band formed Lykathea Aflame along with the drum talents of Tomáš Corn. Appalling Spawn formed in 1993 and released their first demo Bestial, Mystical & Spiritual (The First Spawn) in 1996. Appalling Spawn's only album was the 1999 release Freedom, Hope And Fury (The Second Spawn). They played technical death metal/grind with melodic and Egyptian tinges; a hint of what was to come on Elvenefris. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Appalling+Spawn">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
