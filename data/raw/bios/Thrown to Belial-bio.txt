Thrown to Belial was a British deathcore band from Essex, England. Formed in late 2006, the trio, Dom, Eddy and Sam seeked to form an extreme metal band, thus Thrown to Belial was born, after a search Luke Griffin emerged from the depths of the internet after impressing the band with his unique vocal styling.

However. The band still had to search for a drummer and after a long search came across Jake, more than capable of being in Thrown to Belial, with the line-up complete, the band started work on their debut EP "Voices of the Underworld".

Thrown to Belial split up on 2009. Luke Griffin is now a part of the deathcore band Acrania from London.
