2 sets of brothers formed in 1998 as a covers band and have developed their sound into what has become one of the most original on the UK music scene. Despite their young years, the band has toured the UK extensively and continue to go from strength to strength, growing musically further and further and stretching the boundaries of hard rock. The fanbase constantly increases with every performance, with fans coming back time and time again - a true testament to a great live band. NG26 have gigged with many great unsigned acts and tribute bands, and have been on tour with established acts Tygers of Pan Tang, Cyclefly, Pro-jekt and Kill2This. After many years of die-hard live performances and the constant evolution of their superb and awe-inspiring songwriting, NG26 entered Parr Street studios in Liverpool (where Marillion, Genesis and Coldplay have created hit albums) to record their 3 track demo, receiving glowing praise by music press and fans alike. The band entered Hive Studios in Derby mid February 2006 to begin the recording sessions for their highly awaited debut album, 'Break Away'. The album was released on October 31st 2006, and is currently available at all NG26 shows, to order on the official NG26 myspace page and www.hmv.co.uk, and selected HMV and independent stores in the midlands.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/NG26">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
