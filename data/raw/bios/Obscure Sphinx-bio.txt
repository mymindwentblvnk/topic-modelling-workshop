The Obscure Sphinx project was formed in 2008 with a specific goal in mind: to grab the listener's hand, take him on the brink of madness, tell him about it, and bring him back safely. Their live perfomances resemble dark rituals of untold fears and shrieking repressed emotions. Although musically they seem to have found their place somewhere between post and doom metal, they are not afraid to search for inspirations in other genres. Constantly toying with conventions, Obscure Sphinx merges sonic spaces and electronic samples with the crushing combo of 8-string guitars and 6-string bass rhythmics. All of this is flavoured by a unique voice of the vocalist.

Currently Obscure Sphinx consists of:
Wielebna (vocals)
Bartek (guitar)
Yony (guitar, ex-Rootwater, ex-Licorea)
blady (bass)
Werbel (drums) <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Obscure+Sphinx">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
