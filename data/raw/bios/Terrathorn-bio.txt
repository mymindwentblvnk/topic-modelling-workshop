“These guys take inspiration from old school thrash bands such as Metallica, Megadeth and Merciful Fate, and mix it up with more modern influences to create a sound that is fresh and exciting yet brutally heavy. What really sets Terrathorn apart from the rest of the pack is the “fun” element to their live show, something many bands seem to miss the point of entirely. Terrathorn make a worthy addition to the BOA unsigned stage, and should guarantee that those watching will leave the tent on a high.” - Luci Herbert MTUK (taken from their myspace - http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendid=49076225) <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Terrathorn">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
