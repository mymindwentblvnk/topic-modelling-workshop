MoonMadness, a hard rocking yet melodic band from Tampere, Finland, had it’s initial starting point already at the late 90’s when old buddies Otto and Juha wanted to start all over with new band on a totally new basis. In the late 2001 the first one aboard was Turkka. By spring 2004 the line was completed with vocalist Satu and drummer Ari and MoonMadness played their first show in April the same year. The band describes their music as melodramatic heavy that mixes influences throughout 70´s and 80’s to contemporary metal.

MoonMadness developed their live act quickly and recorded a live promo from their second gig in June 2004. In November the band supported Sonata Arctica at the Pakkahuone Hall in Tampere and their live debut in the capital Helsinki took place in March 2005. In following month their show at Palatsi in turku, Finland was streamed live in the Internet.

In February 2006 MoodMadness released their debut’ single “Thunder” which got positive reviews all around the globe. In the same month the drum throne was taken over by Antto Nikolai and in late summer Heidi took over the vocal duties. Almost immediately MoonMadness entered the recording studio with the new members and started works on the forthcoming album, scheduled to be released in spring 2007.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Moonmadness">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
