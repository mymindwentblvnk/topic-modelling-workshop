Colorado’s ever-evolving rock quintet HonorTheFallen began its humble beginnings in summer 2006. Known for a vigorous, reckless, and some time’s even dangerous live shows, these young men will stake everything in their live shows, leaving sweat, blood, tears, and their hearts on stage. Comprised of Matt Guerin on Vocals, Kenny Sienkiewicz on Drums, Jerrod Fassler on Bass, and Dual Guitarist/Keyboardist Dan Ha and Ben Thompson, Broomfield’s finest are ready to inspire and provoke the music scene around them. After great success with HonorTheFallen’s first E.P. “Out of Thin Air”, their first full-length album “Pathos” is sure to make some heads turn. Combining rock, post-hardcore, and experimental elements with influences coming from Emery, Underoath, and Thrice, it’s hard to pin point one band that they are similar to. With over 5000+ miles of road under their belts these boys continue their push to become the best band they can be. With plans of their second semi national tour, and release of their first full-length album on the horizon the boys of HonorTheFallen look to the endless possibilities of what’s to come. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Honor+the+Fallen">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
