Celebrant was grounded by Pascal Mooren (drums) and Geert Thaens (lead guitar) in 1994. In that same year Pierre “Pierke” Fiddelaers (vocals) and Bart “Puk” Straetemans (guitar) joined the band. At the end of that year the first demo “Nocturnal Goddess” (black darkmetal) was recorded at Music House Studio in Overpelt. Early 1996 the band releases a second demo called “Blessing the Blackness” which was recorded at the same studio. The style was more Black- Death metal orientated. Early 1997 Pierke decides to leave the band and within a period of months Kevin Vangelooven becomes the new lead singer. Jurgen Vanderhaegen ..boards and Jan “Jengel”Jacobs on bass also join the band. In this line- up the first CD “Slaughter of Eden” is recorded at Dyprins Studio early 1999. In 2000 tragedy strikes and Pascal dies. Mark takes his place in the band. Due to the upkeeping demand for the demos, in 2003 the cd-r “Dark Memories from Beyond” was released on which, apart from the 2 demos, also 4 unreleased tracks were recorded. Because of Pierke’s return to the band in 2005, 3 out of 4 original band members were active again. In 2006 the long expected CD “Spawn Of Chaos” is recorded at our own studio. In 2007 Mark decides to leave the band and the hunt for a new drummer is on. Nevertheless the band goes on and signs a deal with Trinity Records Hong Kong for the release of “Spawn Of Chaos” which will be mastered and mixed at Belgian CCR studio and released by June 2007.
