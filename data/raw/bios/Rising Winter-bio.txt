BIOGRAPHY:
Formed in January 2009, with the idea of playing rock music, Rising Winter has achieved much in past couple of months. From its very beginning band was meant to be international project, a collaboration of musicians from around the world. Line ups came and went and recording became more or less a problem. Also due multiple composers band had too much space between sounds of the songs. From 18 composed songs, only 11 were selected for debut album “In Times Of Great Storm” which is finished recording and its being slowly prepared for mixing. Band decided to release the album as internet release.
On 22nd August 2009 debut album was made available to the internet. When September came band was starting to disband.  Dushan wanted to musically advance and others were not for the such ideas. So band started slowly to disband.
 Band stopped its activites in middle of September.
