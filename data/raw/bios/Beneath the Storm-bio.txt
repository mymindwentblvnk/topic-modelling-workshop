"The one-man noise terrorist known as Beneath The Storm is back with his stunning 2nd album â€“ Evil Reflections. And it makes his debut album sound like a collection of nursery rhymes. This album is 62 minutes of pure unwanted Funeral Doom Metal torture with added layers of Ambient based Sludge Metal added to fuck up your entire world. 
Each of the songs are expertly played and written by one crazy as hell individual. 
Evil Reflection is a dark, moody and unflinching ride into the darkness. Don't say I didn't warn you if this album leaves you an emotional shivering wreck. 
A brilliant and twisted work of genius.
