Distress of Ruin, a melodic death metal band from Joensuu, Finland, was established in early 2010 when guitarists Säynevirta and Niiranen along with drummer Romppanen joined forces and started rehearsing together. All this time, they were additionally looking for a bassist and a vocalist to complete the band. The current line-up was established Autumn 2010 when Distress of Ruin was joined by bassist Tolonen and vocalist Ruotsalainen.

During its first active year, Distress of Ruin released its first demo, Demo 2011, that gained appreciation among others in Kaaoszine and metallimusiikki.net.
