Daemonicium is a symphonic black metal band from Poland formed by brothers Venthruel (drums) and Myst (vocals) in April 1996. In 2001, the band's first demo CD "Lord of Moon" was recorded in Altheya studio by Robert Baum from the band Undish. The band's musical style on this CD was black metal, without keyboards, but full of melody and power taking inspiration from classical composers such as Musorgsky, Tschaykovsky and Beethoven. 

In 2003 keyboardist Hagne joined Daemonicium and the band commenced work composing for their first full-length album. The result "Through Time and Death" was recorded at summer 2004 in Bialystok in HERTZ studio and was well received in Poland.
