Austrias metal act Sertycon formed in 2005 and since then is on the way to achieve honor in the scene. Sertycon are Markus Warum (Taiges), Patrick Obergantschnig (Gante), Andreas Hecke (Hecko), Daniel Platzer (Sly) and Markus Auer (Max), five guys with different influences evolving out of their individual taste for fine metal music. 
A lot of live experience, the in January 2009 released EP “War Megiddo“ and a growing fan base complete this whole brutal package, that will smash your ears with their diversified guitar riffing, powerful rythm section,grooving blast area and some extraordinary voice action(Somebody call it BREE BREE). What future will bring, can't be said right now, but Sertycon is on its way. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sertycon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
