Disrupter is the all original electronic music of David Sarrazin.

Disrupter's performances draw from his extensive backround as a percussionist,
singer and composer to give each live set a spontaneous one-of-a-kind sound.
Disrupter has released a track "Fat Omen" on Black Spot Audio recordings. and
has launched a bandcamp site where albums and free tracks can be downloaded.


Sarrazin was also a founding member of the bands Ting Kong,
Tool and Die and Savage Aural Hotbed.
