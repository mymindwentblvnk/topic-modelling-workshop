Wytchcraft is a doom metal band from Germany. While the core of their music is clearly doom, their music shows manifold influences from viking metal, traditional heavy metal and even some progressive elements. Vocalist Kai Tubbesing makes use of both clear, soaring vocals as well as death metal grunts. 

Wytchcraft were founded by Patrice Kestner and Daniel Westheide in 1999. After Patrice Kestner left the band, the line-up that recorded the Grenzg√§nger Mini-CD and the album "I Taste Your Fucking Tears Of Sorrow" was formed, consisting of Eric Asmussen (b), Markus Kratz (g), Fabian Regmann (d), Kai Tubbesing (v) and Daniel Westheide (g).

In November 2006 the musicians decided to put the band on hold. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wytchcraft">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
