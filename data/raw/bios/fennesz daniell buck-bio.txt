Here we are presented with a live collaboration from 3 heavy weights in the experimental and improvisational scene. Christian Fennesz needs no introduction of course; his electronic compositions have been stunning listeners for years now. David Daniell has just released his debut solo album on Thrill Jockey, but is also a member of the ambient rock trio San Agustin and Tony Buck many of you should know from The Necks. “Knoxville” is a recording of the 3 of them playing together for the first time and as expected, it’s truly glorious. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fennesz+Daniell+Buck">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
