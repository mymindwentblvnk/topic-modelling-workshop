Multi-instrumentalist Chris Cohen has done time with Deerhoof, Haunted Graffiti, Cass McCombs, White Magic, and Danielson -- now he's embarking on a new solo project under the Captured Tracks umbrella. After releasing a number of albums as The Curtains, this fall he restarts with a new LP, Overgrown Path, out September 25 (2012), which includes the subtly psychedelic pop song, "Caller No. 99."
