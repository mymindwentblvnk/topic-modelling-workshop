In March of the year 2008 Tristan, Jörg and Gerrit had the idea to form a new band. After a short time of consider, they decided to indulge the old heroes of Melodic Elk Death. A name for the band was discovered quick and the metal community was enriched by a new child called “Sanity’s Eclipse”.

To complete the band Timo joined them after a few auditions. With this lineup, the first song “War Machinery” was recorded and published on Myspace. In this time Jörg took over the vocals in addition of bass playing and the whole band was hardworking for new song material and the raise of their equipment.

After a while the decison to hire a new member for the vocals was made. With Matze the position was occupied fast and the whole project was leaded to a higher level. A short period after Matzes participation, the Mercenaries Metal Meeting was used to spread their “Ruhr Area Melodic Death Metal”.

Since this time, some concerts were played (including gigs with Sabiendas, Sardonic and Drone) and the band was able to assure themselves a position in the local scene. The next project is the recording of their debut album, which is produced in self-production and currently under development. Despite all that, every opportunity to feed the hungry masses with gigs will be challenged! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sanity%27s+Eclipse">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
