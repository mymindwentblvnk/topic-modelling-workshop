Without God is a stoner / doom metal band from Moscow, Russia. Without God was formed in 2008 by guitarist/vocalist Anton and guitarist Olga. They liked depressive slow groovy music, thus they decided to create "one more cheerless doom metal band" and began to write songs. The first one finished was "Forever" - a combination of low tuned riffs, slow rhythm, howling and growling vocals with raw hardcore sound. Some time later drummer Ivan and bass-guitarist Victor joined Without God.

Current lineup:
Anton - vocals, guitars, 
Olga - guitars, 
Viktor - bass, 
Ivan - drums
