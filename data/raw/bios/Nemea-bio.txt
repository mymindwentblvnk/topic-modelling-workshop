We are writing December 2009 and we just released our first demo entitled: A Lion Sleeps In The Heart Of Every Brave Man in our hometown Ostend (Belgium). This was almost exactly a year after our first show in the current line up. We started out back in 2007, but our line up today is very different from what it was in the beginning. We were a four piece back then, but after a few shows our drummer and bassist didn't felt like continuing.

Nemea went comatose until the beginning of 2008, when ex- and current members from bands like Take It Down and The Brave Do Not Fear The Grave joined. It felt like a blood transfusion that revitalized this band. At the same time, the remaining original Nemea members had spread out to bands such as Low Society, Disnight and Dedicted.

This release marks a new milestone for us as a band. We tried to write our own story and we think we captured what we currently are capable of. A Lion Sleeps In The Heart Of Every Brave Man comprises of three songs, that each represent a chapter of the concept we have written out for this release. We have put our heart in this and honestly hope you will like the path we are taking. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nemea">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
