BIO
Only one thing is certain, and let me make this very clear. The world you live in is empty. The world you see around you is only material. What we as humans aspire in this life - this world - to accomplish is done so in the utmost vanity. There are many gateways in this life, however, which can lead one into either their greatest dream, or worst nightmare. Only few are ever able to find these gateways, and even fewer who can cross them. Those who do cross them become a paragon ov the human consciousness. But before one may cross the abyss between mundane existence and spiritual transcendence, they must overcome the walls and barricades humanity has conditioned us to fall victem to. There is a force among us which is determined to corrode these obstacles, and liberate those whom it deems worthy ov such greatness. Only the strong and the determined can be awakened to the forces and beings ov such divinity. Few humans have the opportunity to be enlightened by this great force ov truely unparallelled liberation. This force is called, Infernal Awakening. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Infernal+Awakening">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
