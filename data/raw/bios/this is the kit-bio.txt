This Is The Kit is an English band formed by musician / singer Kate Stables (lead vocals, banjo, guitar), with: Jesse D Vernon (bass, guitar, violin), Jamie Whitby-Coles (drums), Rozi Plain (vocals, guitar), Neil Smith (guitar) and Philip Sirop (batterie).

Stables has been turning heads in all the right places since 2003:  a first album Krülle Bol produced by  John Parish , singles (Two Wooden Spoons) released by Rob da Bank’s label  Sunday Best  and a long-awaited second album on  Dreamboat Records  in 2010.  Wriggle out the Restless was born out of a new, slower  way of working.  Gestated over a long period the album has drawn on  This Is The Kit’s  many musical friends (Rozi Plain [[label]Fence ], Jim Barr  [of Portishead ] Francois [Fence] and The Liftmen [[label]Twisted Nerve]) to fill out their delicate music into a full, robust sound. “The aim was to have fun playing with people who’s work I really like” says Kate “the more you exchange and share with people the better things get and the more you learn.”

This Is The Kit perform regularly as a two-piece with Stables on vocals, guitar and banjo, and Vernon on violin, guitar, bass and percussion.
