A diamond in the rough? More like a punch in the face. Burned in Effigy originally formed in 2005 in New London, Connecticut. Four salty New England “chaps” with a taste for metal and a need to rock. Inspired by bands like Metallica and Alice in Chains Burned in Effigy have picked up the torch of good metal and carry it proudly. Heavy and crushing guitars, solid beats with catchy and tasteful vocals hooks are the main staple of this bands diet. Driving and straight forward this band has a special edge to it guaranteed to satisfy even the biggest appetite for metal! Burned In Effigy’s unique mix of old school and modern metal is what makes them stand out. B.I.E. brings a gnarly new flavor to the scene. Driven to influence the metal world, they stop at nothing and makes no compromises.

The band’s roots date back to the early 2000s when brothers Jared and Alex Meekhoff teamed with, life long friend and drummer, Zack Begin.  Based out of New London, Connecticut, the guys grew up together. Bored with bland metal plaguing the scene, the trio began creating their signature sound.  In 2004, lead singer and guitarist Jared was deployed overseas to serve a one year tour in Iraq.  Upon his return, the band immediately starting writing and in 2005 recorded their first demo at Static Productions in Rhode Island.

In 2006 the band began writing new material for thier first full lenght. Again with the help of Peter LaGrasse at Static Productions Burned In Effigy released their debut self titled album In October 2007. The album lays it all down in 16 mold breaking tracks that sonically surpass the quality of an unsigned band. “We wanted an album that has a unique blend of riffs and vocals. Basically we incorporate all our favorite styles, we play what we like,” explains guitarist Alex
