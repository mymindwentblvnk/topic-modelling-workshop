DJ Laz (born Lazaro Mendez) is a Cuban-American rapper and DJ from Miami. While others have switched to other, newer trends, he remains one of the most prolific Miami bass artists. DJ Laz, also known as "The Pimp with the Limp", focuses on booty bass music influenced by Latin genres, but he occasionally makes Latin hip hop and gangsta rap recordings. Laz was one of the first to mix Latin music with Miami bass, together with Jonny Z.

He was born at Hollywood Memorial Hospital in Hollywood, Florida. He got his radio start at Hot 105 (WHQT FM 105.1) in 1986. He currently hosts the weekday "Morning Pimp Show" on Power 96 (WPOW FM 96.5) in Miami, where he has been since 1989. Laz received greater prominence when President Barack Obama appeared on his program in September 2012, with more people introduced to Laz and the Florida hip-hop scene.
