ATTICA RAGE are a heavy rock band from Glasgow, Scotland, formed in 2003 by Ayrshire brothers Richie Rage [drums] and Jonny Parr [vocals, guitar], with Stevie Bell [guitar] joining in 2007 and Matthew Ward [bass] in 2014.  

They have earned a solid reputation for their energetic, powerful live performances at headline shows, tours and festivals across UK and Europe.  Festival appearances include Download, High Voltage, Hard Rock Hell, Hammerfest, Bulldog Bash, Cambridge Rock Festival, Out of the Ashes and SOS Fest; while European highights have included Metal Camp in Slovenia (now Metal Days), HRH Road Trip in Ibiza and Wizzfest in Belgium.  
Attica Rage have supported Saxon, Diamond Head, Blitzkrieg, Armored Saint (with ex-Anthrax vocalist John Bush) and, bizarrely, Mark E. Smith & The Fall and shared festival bills with the likes of Judas Priest, Thin Lizzy , Black Label Society, WASP, Testament and Down, amongst others. Along with Anthrax, Biohazard, Shadows Fall and Fozzy, Attica Rage were one of the bands to perform live at the Metal Hammer Golden Gods Awards bash in London 2012. 

Attica Rage are signed to Off Yer Rocka Recordings with three critically-acclaimed albums under their belt - Ruin Nation, Road Dog and 88MPH.  A definitive live album is due in late 2014, along with 16-date UK & European headline tour and a new studio album is being planned for 2015.
