Was a Heavy/Power Metal band, led by Hiroyas “Iron” Chino and is his oldest musical-project/band. They only released an E.P. entitled "Fire Tales" in 2005. He's now playing in IRON ATTACK! and LIGHTNING. So even if this band never really got disbanded or anything, they moved on and changed their band-name to LIGHTNING. (This can be seen if you look at the band-members playing in LIGHTNING's first E.P. "Soldier Force".)
