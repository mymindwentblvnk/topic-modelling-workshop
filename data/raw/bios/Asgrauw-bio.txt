“It’s the beginning of a harsh winter, late December 2010. It was in this blistering cold, while the snow was pulling a blanket over the borderlands, where a new plague had started to swarm out.”

Asgrauw is an old skool black metal band from
the borderlands of Gelderland, The Netherlands.

Asgrauw refers to the scythe shaped shining of the new moon and is a
Dutch word for the grim and pale color of ash as well. The definition of the style and character of the music can be described this way:

“Raw, powerful and straight, filled with melodic riffs and blast-beats combined with static rhythm sections, both underlined with filthy and raw sounded vocals in both the Dutch and English language.

With influences from bands such as Darkthrone, Sargeist, Horna and
Satanic Warmaster, Asgrauw had created their own style within the black
metal music genre, and still trying to keep the old style of black metal alive.

As we would describe it:
