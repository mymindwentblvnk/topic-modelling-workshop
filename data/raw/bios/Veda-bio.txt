Veda, Queen of Ireland, presents her debut album "Star's Edge". "I'm all about making pop
music for modern homosexuals. That's the kind of shit I grew up listening to - so that's the
kind of shit I make". For almost a decade now, this "self-made man-made woman" has
been the reigning queen of Dublin’s gay nightlight. Space'N'Veda, her weekly show at The
George, has cult status among Dublin's more discerning homosexualists. It's here where
Veda first showcased her own own brand of electro-pop music, and developed her unique
style of drag performance.
 
"I've always dreamt of having my own album, all my own songs with a big glossy picture of
me, and my name splashed across the cover. This is it! Of course in my dream, I was
Sheena Easton." The album was written over a period of of two years with electro cutie
NeoSuperVital aka Tim O'Donovan (BellX1 drummer). ‘Stars Edge’ is Veda’s first solo
album. Combining electro-pop beats with mid-tempo ballads, it is a reflection of Veda’s
wide range of musical influences. "The style reflects the things I truly love: beautiful 80's
electro ballads, dirty disco music, thumping dance music and queer pop. I love all the
fabulous freaks, like Steve Strange, Pete Burns and Boy George and all the new queens
too, like Justin Bond, Our Lady J, Jonny Woo, Patrick Wolf, Empire of the Sun and MGMT."
 
Veda's lyrics paint a musical portrait of life lived in an underground club world, a trannimal
jungle where bears eat chickens and where tranny-chasers and drag queens take turns
eating each other. "There's a lot of breakup songs on this album, cause there's been a lot
of breakups. But some of these songs were written for the queens that I work with, in the
spirit of friendship and to try and capture some of their glitter and sparkle in music.
Except Dolly."
 
The album smells of petrol and perfume, glistens like silver sequins and is fresher than a
new pair of tights. This glittering collection of songs conceived and born live on stage has
finally been distilled and bottled for your pleasure.
