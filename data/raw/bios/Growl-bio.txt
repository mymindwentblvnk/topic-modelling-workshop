There are several bands named Growl:

1) Growl is a post-punk-pop, pop-punk, garage-pop, surf-pop, ambiguous-pop band based in Austin, Texas, known for its high energy, happy shows and tight instrumentation and soaring vocals. Their debut album, "Gallery," was released in 2013.  ""GROWL is a band making solid indie rock that harkens back to indieâ€™s infancy; the days of round-wound guitars, ride cymbals, shaggy haired dudes with no style or money or girlfriends, just a hard line on how to make a good tune." - Chris Galis, KINDFORM" 

2) Growl is an experimental blues outfit, if such a thing exists, from Geneva Switzerland. Growl merges some old school low-fi dirty blues with a  more modern bent on experimentation.
