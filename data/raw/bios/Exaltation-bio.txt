EXALTATION is a Brutal Death Metal band from Germany's beer-soaked heart: Bavaria. Formed in 2002 by Mike (guitars) and Marcus (drums), Auri (bass) joined the band in 2003. One year later the band was finally completed by Matthias on vocals. They released a full length in 2008, Tales of Total Sickness. In fact, that title fits perfectly with what you will get: 29 minutes of pure Sickness.
Their Myspace is not updated for ages but you still can get some pictures and try to contact them. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Exaltation">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
