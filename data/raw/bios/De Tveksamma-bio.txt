The band was formed in 1992 by the drummer Matias Klint and the guitarplayer and vocalist Thomas von Wachenfeldt under the name Maim. In the early day the group was influenced by metal acts like Entombed, Sepultura, Gorefest and Carcass, But also by the swedish hardcore scene led by bands like Refused and Breach. The song Hate was written at that time.

As time moved by the influences striked also from the Black Metal genre and bands like Dissection, Mayhem, Emperor and others. De Tveksamma couldn't really decide which way their music should take, and they took the name "De Tveksamma" which means "The Doubtful". The band also mixed up the brutal influences with more experimental ideas from jazz and pop/rock music and recorded their first album in 1997 together with Julie Laughs nomore on Humla records.

The next era began in 1999/2000 when the influences from swedish traditional music grew stronger and a new member, Bo-Eric Hellman joined the band and inspired the sound with older hard rock influences. Some new songs came up and De Tveksamma recorded their second album "De Tveksamma perform songs about Old Nick and other friends" where released in 2001 on Hanndom productions.

But the band longed for good old Death Metal and in 2006 they took up their axes and began write material for their next album "The Battle in Grensforce" who is planned to be released in early 2007. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/De+Tveksamma">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
