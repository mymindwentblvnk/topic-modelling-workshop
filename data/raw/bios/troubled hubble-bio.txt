Proof that relentless good cheer, mountains of hard work, and a knack for pop hooks don't always lead to disappointment, shattered dreams, and office jobs: Troubled Hubble, the band you've never heard of but that will soon be making you as jitteringly happy as they are. Maybe they already are.  Imagine the very best elements of Tripping Daisy, Weezer, Built to Spill, the New Pornographers, the Weakerthans, and Jets to Brazil, and you'll have barely touched the surface of this remarkable band.

As of 2006 Troubled Hubble have disbanded.  Chris (vocals/guitar) is now working on Heligoats, a solo project.  Brothers Nate (drums) and Andrew (bass) are now members of Kid, You'll Move Mountains.  Josh (guitar) is now sporting a suit and tie. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Troubled+Hubble">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
