Abstract Spirit was founded in Moscow, Russia in 2006 as a side project of the black metal band Twilight Is Mine that is well-known abroad but virtually ignored in Russia. Initially, Abstract Spirit was composed of Stellarghost (keyboards) and Hater (guitar, bass).

In late 2006, they joined the Moscow funeral doom metal band Comatose Vigil. After performing on two festivals (Petrodoom and Moscow Doom Festival II), Stellarghost and Hater left Comatose Vigil because of personal differences.

They continued to work in Abstract Spirit on their old material, and in autumn of 2007 they had sufficient material for a full-length album (6 songs, total duration of about 60 minutes). Before recording the album, the lineup was supplemented by the Comatose Vigil vocalist A.K., who took up vocals and drums. In this lineup Abstract Spirit signed a contract with a Russian label Solitude Prod and recorded their debut album, Liquid Dimensions Change.

On October 10th 2009 they released their second album called Tragedy And Weeds.
