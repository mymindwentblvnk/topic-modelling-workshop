Kladovest was product of czech-ukrainian cooperation. On the first two albums one of the members was Radalf (comes from Czech Republic) but the band now consists only of Ukrainian members - Aleksander, Thurios (from Astrofaes, Drudkh, Hate Forest), he performed vocals on second and third album), and Dmitriy K. 

Kladovest in ancient slavonic beliefs meant something like astral plane in modern esotericism.
