2005

Hank Jones, who celebrates his 87th birthday this month, is in the midst of one of the most productive periods of his long, distinguished career. Following last year’s critically acclaimed outing with the Great Jazz Trio (his final session with his brother, the great drummer Elvin) and two collaborations with saxophone colossus Joe Lovano, Jones is back with For My Father, his debut for Canada's Justin Time label.

One doesn’t turn to Hank Jones for innovation or surprise but rather for highly polished, state-of-the-art mainstream jazz piano. And that’s just what he delivers on this supremely satisfying trio effort with longtime sidemen George Mraz on bass and Dennis Mackrel on drums. Refinement, elegance and sophistication are perhaps overused descriptions for Jones’ piano style, but they fit his approach here, whether on Ellington classics like “Prelude to a Kiss” and “Sophisticated Lady,” Billy Strayhorn’s “Lotus Blossom” and “Blood Count,” Monk’s “Bemsha Swing” or less familiar gems by Al Foster, Harold Mabern and Tom Harrell. Well into his ninth decade, Jones shows no sign of slowing down and his playing, which has always emphasized taste and touch over shock and awe, remains at a world-class level.
