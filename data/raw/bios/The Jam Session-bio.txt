Since the very beginning back in 1998 The Jam Session has been on a neverending quest for doing our own thing, which has lead us on strange paths in heavy and experimental music. Going thru the whole catalogue of releases you'll find everything from insane hardcore, progressive punk and doomy dark metal. It was never our intension to make things as strange as possible, itÂ´s just our way to deal with the smalltown boredom and the result of 5 different individuals trying to express themselves as one unit.

At the time it seems like we're walking down the dark and harsh road (having the new non-recorded songs in mind) but you'll never know what's going down in The Jam Session camp! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Jam+Session">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
