The band was founded 2001 in Padoue/Padova (Italy). The leader is Danilo (guitars & pipers). The bassist is Massimo Cocchetto from Ensoph, bleed in vain. Their only production is "Clamamus Ad Vos" in 2002. They play folkloric metal. Looks a bit like In Extremo or Stille Volk, and they share a melody with this group (probably a common traditional south-european source). The group seems to have disappeared since then.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cum+Fragore">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
