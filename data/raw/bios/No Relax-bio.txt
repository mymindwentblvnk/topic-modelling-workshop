No Relax is a band formed during a joint tour of Ska-P and B.D.P. in 2004 (Bambole Di Pezza) in Italy, where two protagonists Joxemi and Micky have met. They have released two albums, "Gridalo!" (2004) and "Virus de rebeli√≥n" (2006), both being Punk-Rock at base mixed with Swing, Reggae and other genres. The last one comes in two languages - Italian and Spanish, for Europe and Latin America.

Their lyrics affect wide range of problems from social and ecological problems, to animal rights, to personal feelings and introspection. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/No+Relax">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
