Aiumeen Basoa was founded in 1994 with the following members: Egoitz (bass, manuals), Beleak (guitar, voice), Mikelot (guitar, voice), and Belainotz (drums). Later joined the band Paul (wind instruments), Herio (key board), Ibone (voice), and Aitor (violin). Aiumeen Basoa gives importance to the mythology of its land, Euskal Herria (Spain), which is full of legends such the ones dealing with the Akelarres or with the burning of the so-called witches in bonfires. It all influences both the lyrics and musical direction of the band. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Aiumeen+Basoa">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
