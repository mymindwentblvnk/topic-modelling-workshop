Event is a cutting edge hard rock band from New England.

The band was formed out of an ensemble at Berklee College of Music in 1996. The band recorded their first album Electric Skies in 1997 and licensed the debut in 1998 in Japan, Europe and South America. The band has a wide variety of influences that create a unique, sophisticated, driving sound. Over Christmas of 1999 the band began recording their sophomore release Human Condition. Event has teamed up with Jim Pitulski and Inside Out Music America for the album's nationwide release in early 2001. In 2003, they released their third album entitled Scratching at the Surface.

Event combines its hard guitar driven riffs with elements of techno loops and some intricate passages to satisfy the tastes of any hard rock listener. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Event">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
