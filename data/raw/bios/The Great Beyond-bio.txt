Emerging from the vibrant Edinburgh University band scene of 1983 (think Shop Assistants, the Architects of Fear, Nocturnal Vermin), the Great Beyond were a power pop trio focussed around the not inconsiderable song writing talents of vocalist and guitarist Iain Ferguson. Hailing from Lanark, he brought with him the Keith Moon-like drumming skills of Hill 61 skin beater "Fluff" and appended Andrew Smith on bass guitar and occasional 12-string guitar overlays. Early gigs brought a small but burgeoning fan base as well as favourable reviews in the Edinburgh Uni newspaper Student. Much mention was made of Ferguson's voice and the bittersweet nature of the songs and lyrics. There was talk of cutting a single and gigs in exotic places like Glasgow. In spite of an impecunious student background, the trio managed to save a few quid and recorded a rough demo in a very dingy practice room in the nether regions of Leith Walk (not quite the gentrified place it is now). And just as nascent dreams of indie stardom beckoned, it all just, er, fell apart. No big band bust up, or musical differences. Smith and Ferguson graduated and decided journalism was a better option - Ferguson headed for Glasgow, while Smith got a hack job in London. Fluff was already full time employed as a social worker.  Ferguson is now resident in Canada, so a band reformation in the near future unlikely. Still - a morsel of Scots Indy nostalgia - the dream of what might have been. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Great+Beyond">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
