Born in Naples, Italy in 1950, Luciano quickly developed a surprising interest in long sustained sounds. Thus focusing his research on the sound in it’s primary and internal meaning. At the outset on the melodic, rhythmic and harmonic entities. To "re-enter in the sound. to hold it. to hold it… then to leave it to go". In his lifetime he only released one album, 'Dialoghi del presente', in 1977. 

It was not particularly successful at the time of release, but after a 2004 re-release on CD and talk of it spreading through online music communities, it soon became regarded highly amongst fans of modern classical and avant-garde music.

Although his musical career was relatively short lived, Luciano was involved in many important artistic events held in Naples until his death by suicide in 1983
