Shangren is a studio project from New South Wales, Australia created by Vocalist/Guitarist Leonard Ong (Keyboardist of Starforge) in 2009. The name "Shangren" comes from Chinese mythology after a Daoist deity known as Honjun Laozu but is often referred to as Xuan Xuan Shangren, the teacher of the Three Pure Ones. The goal of the project is to introduce oriental tunes and instruments of Asia while adding metal elements to produce a unique new sound. At the moment, the demo is been recorded which will be released between the end of 2009 till the beginning of 2010. So fear us vikings and trolls! For we dynasty warriors shall rise!
