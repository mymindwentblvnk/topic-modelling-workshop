Bloody Thorns were an unsigned german band and existed from the beginning of 1996 to spring 1998. They released one demo called "The Fall Of Reason" which acclaimed many good reviews by underground fanzines. Due to their drummer leaving the band to join a heavier, faster band and the lack of finding a new local drummer capable of playing the old and new stuff, the band disbanded spring 1998.

Oh, by the way: due to a harddrive crash many years ago we lost all our pictures, photos and artworks. Great stuff, huh? <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bloody+Thorns">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
