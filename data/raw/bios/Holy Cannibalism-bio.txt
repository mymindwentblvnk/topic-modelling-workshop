Started in early October of 2006, Holy Cannibalism is a Noise Grinding Death Metal band from Riverside, California that is made up of two brothers who go by the name Gorehammerithius(drums/vocals) and The Reaper(Guitars). Not like other grindcore/death metal bands Holy Cannibalism also is influenced with a little black death and thrash music. Our lyrical theme is Death, Gore, and Necrophiliac. Some people might be confused with our name and might think we are either a Christian band or an anti religion band. Neither of those are correct. Holy Cannibalism has no particular meaning in it.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Holy+Cannibalism">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
