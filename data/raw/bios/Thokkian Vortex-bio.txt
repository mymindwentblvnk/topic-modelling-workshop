In 2006, the Lord Kaiaphas, the former singer for the Norwegian Black Metal band Ancient (1995-1998), created a solo project called Thokkian Vortex. He produced two songs and revealed the project online on 06/06/06.

Shortly afterwards, Kaiaphas secured a deal with Sleaszy Rider records for a split CD release called The Saturnine Alliance together with Hungarian band, Aetherius Obscuritas. That CD was released in 2007.

Pleased with the new project, Lord Kaiaphas wrote another song, Into The Nagual. Since Ancient and Dark Funeral had toured Europe together back in 1997 Lord Kaiaphas decided to send the song to Lord Ahriman (Dark Funeral/Wolfen Society) to see if he would be interested in recording the guitars for the track. Ahriman liked what he heard so he accepted and took things a step further by composing new riffs on top of Kaiaphas’s arrangement. 

By 2013 the Lord Kaiaphas had decided to compose and produce a full length album. That year he met guitarist, Zed Destructive, the vocalist for Progressive Death/Black metallers, Winterhorde and invited him to record some guitars on the album. The bass parts would be recorded by Mantus(Patria/Mysteriis), Scorpios, and experienced bassist, Vitan, a friend of Zed’s. Additional guitar solos were provided by Mantus, Dmitri Alperovich (Seventh Station), and Vargblod (Draugul/Khaospath).

Although Lord Kaiaphas had signed with Swedish label, Unexploded records, for the release of Into The Nagual in 2013, the label did not release the album until early 2016. By then Thokkian Vortex had been rehearsing with new bassist, Sil, and were ready to perform again.
