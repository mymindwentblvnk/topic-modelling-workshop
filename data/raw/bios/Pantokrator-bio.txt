Pantokrator is a christian band formed in autumn 1996. A number of demos were made, but it was not until 2001 - when the band released their self-financed EP "Songs of Solomon" - that things started to move.

In march the same year Pantokrator made an appreciated concert at the Swedish "Bobfest" festival. They also appeared on national TV in a short report from this festival. Two years later, Pantokrator was back at the same festival, this time to release their debut album - "Blod" (Rivel records). "Blod" recieved great responce from media. For example, the Scandinavian music and media magazine "Monster" gave it 4/5 and the German magazine "Rock hard" gave it 7/10.

During the years Pantokrator has played live in quite a lot of different places. In 2005, they performed at the Gates of Metal festival in Sweden and won over bands such as Edguy and Dimmu Borgir. April 2007 they toured through Switzerland, France, Czech Republic and Germany in support of their new album "Aurum".
