Under the shadow of mighty pine trees covered with thick layer of snow, originated the project, a a, a sad and mournful song of the forest, which long ago forgot about which no one remembers. Mysterious and gloomy, the forest and at the same time great and powerful. Ancient pines keep the ancient knowledge and remember every moment of life of our Mother Earth. And in this realm of wisdom, peace and quiet, after long thoughts and feelings, I have heard the call of the mighty forest - a project conceived Winter Grief, which means Winter Grief. This affliction of the winter woods, forests dying, dark and yet beautiful. After the destruction, there is creation, and nothing will stop this sacred circle. Grief forests, like the song, it has no genre or ideology. It is a voice calling us back to nature, to know its original beauty, soak up the centuries accumulated forces and send them to a good cause, is pleasing to our great gods. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Winter+Grief">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
