There are 2 bands named Anthropophagus.

1) Death Metal band from Detroit, Michigan

2) A Black Metal band from the UK


1) In 2010, Anthropophagus made its long ascent into this realm. The band seeks to combine the fury of Old School Death Metal with the skull-pounding crawl of Doom. Following the ethics of older bands such as Morbid Angel, Incantation and Immolation; this is a band forged in the image of the godfathers of the genre. No pretensions of innovation, no lame gimmicks; just blasphemous riffs and heavy atmosphere.

2) Anthropophagus does not take claim to be a pivotal turning point for the black metal genre. On the contrary the bands music aims to recapture the grim and disturbing atmosphere which was typical of early/mid ‘90s black metal albums, a feature which is sadly lacking on modern releases. This atmosphere is created by the use of unconventional guitar riffs and haunting samples to compliment uniquely inhuman vocals and deliberately unpolished production. The result is an un-relentless black metal storm.

The bands themes restrict themselves to a pure misanthropic philosophy reflecting the bands disgust and discontentment with modern life. The band conceals their messages within carefully crafted metaphors buried within their lyrics.

Since their formation Anthropophagus have produced a 4 track self titled demo, released in October 2005 in order to gain response and feedback on the bands direction and sound. This received a positive response from fans but had only a limited distribution. The bands debut full length “As The Dead Weep” continues the tide of misanthropy, this time available to a world audience.
