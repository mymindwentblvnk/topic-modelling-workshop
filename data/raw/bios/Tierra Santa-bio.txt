Tierra Santa is a spanish-singing Heavy-Metal-band from La Rioja (Spain). The Band was formed in 1997 by Ángel, Arturo, Roberto, Iñaki and Tomy. With much effort they first were autoproduced. Later they started their break-through (mainly in spanish-speaking countries), when they went on tour with Avalanch and Mägo de Oz. In 2004 they toured through the United States for the first time.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tierra+Santa">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
