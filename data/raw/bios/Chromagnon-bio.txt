Chromagnon was founded in the winter of 1998 by Matti Kemppainen (guitar) and Jouko Partanen (drums), who had already been playing together for several years. Other founding members, new to Chromagnon, were Janne (guitar) and Mikko Sirviö (vocals).

Through 1999 members of Chromagnon did a few gigs in various compositions involving members outside the core band.

In 2000 Chromagnon had their very first own gig at the Hiukkarok concert. Besides of Matti and Jouko the line-up involved Antti H. (2nd guitar), Harri K. (bass) and Ilkka V. (vocals).

After two years of silence Chromagnon published their first demo album labeled 'Chromagnon' in 2002. At the end of the year they lost their training space.

In 2003 Chromagnon moved their training sessions to the living room of Mika T.

In 2004 Mikko Ritvanen (guitar) joins the band and Mikko Sirviö makes a return to the mike. Hiukkarok is arranged again after a year's pause and returned to its original location at Hiukka beach in Sotkamo.

Since 2004 Chromagnon has finally acquired them a regular basist (Ville Niskanen) and continues to publish their latest hits through mikseri.net music portal (http://www.mikseri.net/artists/?id=49562) and their website www.chromagnon.net. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Chromagnon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
