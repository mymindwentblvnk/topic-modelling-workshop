There is only 1 Catalano: The real deal since 2007

 Hard rock/Metal from Chicago, USA

 Catalano has always defied any clear genre-based classifications. To be honest, any labeling of their music wouldn’t do them justice. To put this myriad musical mixture under any label other than “unique” is to do so in vain. With influences ranging from bands such as Queensryche, Dokken, Nightwish, Edguy and Metallica to Journey, The Who, The Beatles. Catalano refuses to place a label on anything the band does. With members having Local and National success with bands such as Gynger Lynn, Miss Crazy, The Dave Shankle Group and Pyper to name a few, The band formed after working on a few songs on Pat Catalano’s recent solo project “Only a Dream”. After recording sessions wrapped up they guys decided to get out and bring an energetic live show that is reminiscent of an 80's arena rock show.
