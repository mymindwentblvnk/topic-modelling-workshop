Anathallo was an American indie rock band originally from Mt. Pleasant, Michigan, and then based in Chicago, Illinois. The band started practicing in the fall of 2000 and played their first show soon afterward. Their name derived from a Greek word meaning "to renew, refresh or bloom again". The band went into hiatus in 2008, and, by 2009, was deemed to have split .

Anathallo utilized a wide variety of instruments, including horns, guitars, drums, piano, bells, and even unconventional objects like chains, velcro strips, stomp boxes, and pipes. The band released several recordings through Selah Records, a vinyl release through Potential Getaway Driver, as well as completely independent releases. Their UK distributed release, Four: A Great Wind More Ash, was released by Big Scary Monster (BSM) in 2008
