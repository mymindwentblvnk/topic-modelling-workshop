Melancholie is an Atmospheric Black Metal/ambient project from the Netherlands by Robbert van Rumund. The project started out in the winter of 2009, when the first songs were written for Melancholie. Some demos were recorded before the release of the first fullength in 2012. Samples of the fullength 'Verlangen' can also be listened here. A physical version of 'Verlangen' was released on tape by the dutch label Zwaertgevegt, limited to 66 copies.
