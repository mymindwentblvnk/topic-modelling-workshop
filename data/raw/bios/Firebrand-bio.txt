There is more than one artist with this name:

1) Firebrand is a post-hardcore emo band from Harrisonburg, Virginia formed in 2018.

Firebrand is a band of four people from different walks of life sharing stories of loss & redemption.

Firebrand is composed of Adam Livesay and Matthew McBee on guitar, Josh Sprouse on bass, Branden Thomas on drums, and Stephen Arlen on vocals.
