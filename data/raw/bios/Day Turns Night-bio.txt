Day Turns Night is a metal band from the Helderberg area (Western Province) in South Africa. 

Most of them used to play in former bands, Ferdi, Roland and Tian in Fozim, situated in Somerset West, and Karel played in a band (Decay of Angels) situated in Stellenbosch. 

Earlier in 2005 the two bands played a few shows together, had a few drinks and almost instantly became friends. After backbreaking tours and shows of remembrance, Fozim and Decay of Angels broke up more or less the same time in 2005. 

Karel was asked to join. First he refused but accepted the offer about a month later. 

After the tragic death of former guitarist, Izan Visser, and much deliberation as continuing with the band without Izan seemed impossible, Theunis Cilliers (recording engineer they worked with on Another day in Hell) was recruited to form the current line-up of Day Turns Night.

Day Turns Night is:
Karel Kogler- Vocals 
Theunis Cilliers - Guitar
Roland De Beer - Guitar 
Ferdi Groenewald - Drums
Tian Beeton - Bass

Izan Visser(RIP, Previous Guitarist)
