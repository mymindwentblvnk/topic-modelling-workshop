(Note: There are two bands labeled as Inferius. The first is a Brazillian death metal band formed in 1998. This biography details the second Inferius, an American deathcore band formed in 2017.)

Inferius is an American deathcore band that was founded in early 2017 by guitarist CJ (AKA Xero) and drummer Harnak Singh. The band was originally oriented heavily towards progressive death metal, mainly influenced by bands like Opeth and Suicide Silence. After releasing only one demo track (The Infernal Rapture), the band split up due to building tensions surrounding guitarist Xero's increasing passion in certain political ideologies, in particular Nazism. According to former drummer Harnak Singh, Xero had attacked him with a stapler while completely naked in late April of 2017. In May of 2017, the band sued Xero with charges of assault and rape, but the local court involved decided that it was inhumane to imprison a mentally challenged child, so no files were charged. After multiple lineup changes, Inferius was started back up again, now with the addition of a new vocalist (Doc Louis) and a bodyguard for Xero (J-Fury). No material has been recorded for this band, but they are said to be musically oriented towards deathcore.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Inferius">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
