Jeff Wood, the progenitor of Shat, is quite the odd gent. Serving as bassist for the famed and acclaimed The Dillinger Escape Plan, Wood somehow lost his mind after supposedly being shot in the head and went on to form this obscure/vulgar side project. The songwriting is completely dominated by Wood's Id, sticking closely to dick and fart jokes, but stunningly layered guitar riffs more than make up for the 7th grade humour. In the end, Shat drops out some side splitting tracks, at least for the guys, and is (barely) more than just music junk food. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Shat">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
