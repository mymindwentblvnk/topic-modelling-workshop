SLOWTORCH formed in Bolzano, Italy, in early 2004. Known as Godmachine at first, the band was renamed after a number of line-up changes. The style remained the same - loud, straight-in-the-face rock music with stoner influences, which has been compared to that of Clutch, Black Label Society and Black Sabbath. The band played support slots for various big names, including Ill Niño, Nick Oliveri’s Mondo Generator, Dutch heavyweights Toner Low and German krautrockers Colour Haze.

Over the years, SLOWTORCH released two demo recordings, Generator (4 tracks, 2004) and Scrap Metal & Oil Stains (3 tracks, 2006), and a full length album called Adding Fuel To Fire, (Blindness Records, 2007). Adding Fuel To Fire was well received by international media, got excellent reviews and is being distributed online through various platforms.

Some songs are available for download from the SLOWTORCH website. Part of the band's older material, along with Adding Fuel To Fire, is being played on a number of radio stations in Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Canada, the US. In July 2008, Another One Down from the album Adding Fuel To Fire was featured on Vol. 10 of the Kill City sampler series published by US label 272 records.

In January 2009, SLOWTORCH released their new EP called From Radiation They Came.

2010 saw the departure of long-time vocalist Peter Tomasi and the arrival of Matteo Meloni. The new line-up played a tour through Northern Italy, one through the UK, and recorded a new EP in between. More news soon!
