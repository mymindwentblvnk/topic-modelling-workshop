Acaro is an American melodic death metal band with heavy influence from the New England Metalcore  scene.

By bringing the old into the 21st Century, and keeping the new grounded to it's roots, ACARO achieves the brutal/melodic blend that can stir emotions and hit you over the head with a sledgehammer at the same time.

These individuals are brought together by the love of metal, the drive to create, the desire to succeed, and the need to bring ACARO's music and energy to as many people, in as many places as possible.
