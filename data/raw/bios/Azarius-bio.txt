Formed in 1993, three raging, metal-clad high school musicians joined together to create one of the heaviest bands Louisville, KY had to offer. Following in the footsteps of predecessors such as Deicide, Death, and Morbid Angel, Azarius ascended the ever growing totem of Louisville metal and established a cult following of rabid fans eager to explode with testosterone-driven fury and fuel the band's powerful live performances.

An enraged Danny 'Death' led the group's menacing vocals, matching the intensity of shredding guitarist Adam Uncleback and gun-blaring drummer Mike Fleitz. The band recorded and released three cassettes, Demo '93 (re-released as Remnants of God), Essence of Satan, and Holy Desecration before parting ways in the mid-late 90's to pursue other interests. The material (along with several unreleased recordings) has recently been enhanced and transferred to disc.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Azarius">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
