Djizoes: (pronounced “Jesus”) will take you away with their wild and enchanting rhythms. Part hard rock, part metal, this progressive and evolving band has since their creation in 2002 managed to convert many an unbeliever! The Concrete Fog”, Djizoes: first EP was produced by Post Tenebras Rock after noticing the band at their 3rd concert! Djizoes: then went on to record a 3 track ball teaser which opened the doors to Japan and the US. Two 30+ gig tours later they were back in Switzerland recording “In The Papers”, their first full album. Djizoes: released this album in Tokyo in December 2006, setting off their 2nd Japanese tour. The band just returned from their summer tour, which took them to Hong Kong, Japan and Taiwan where they played the HoHaiYan festival in front of 50'000 strong crowd! Their new CD, "Erkonoclast", was released during the tour.

Djizoes: fan base has grown internationally rallying around their logo, Erkon, present since the beginning and forever to stay, which several fans have not hesitated, amongst other things, to have tattooed or made into jewellery. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Djizoes">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
