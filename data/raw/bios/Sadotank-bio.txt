Vokills Joey Sado: Joey Sado is the dangerous and sadistic front man, his words and presentation are similar to the Hashshashin, a medieval militant deranged drugged sect. Joey is the manifestation of a neo insurgent who will rise up against the conventions of our time.

Thunder Striid: His name means battle, and a anti human war is his goal. As leader of a subversive cult his deeds are malefic and horrible. Striid is a well know black metal artist who also has an interest in old school metal and trash metal.

Torment of Blast Paria: is as mysterious as transparent. In his drunkbanging the drums he likes to vision the rolling thunder of his forefathers voice, while they attack the roman legions in a darkened past. Some speak of his literate aspirations, but ominous secrecy dominates.

Chainsaw Lee Hell: Lee did not choose his name; it was given to him by a demon that spared his life. He is the ruler of the night and an awkward stranger of daylights passing. Pain in memories and liver continue to motivate him into creation.

Master of Evil Rooth666: Seven String alcoholic sado master who arised from hell back in the darkend days of torture

Sadotank arises from the old ashes of the speed metal band "Dust Devil". The members came back together after 13 years of scattering around in several bands and projects. In spring 2007 they started once again their poisoned brotherhood.

This time it's a mix of thrash metal with 666% alcoholic booze which they call "Alcoholic Hellnoise".


Sadotank produced a godslaying sick metal and called it Alcoholic Hellnoise!

Their thrash metal is fucking brutal, mean, aggressive mind blowing impressive and oldskool at the same time.

Sadotankâ€™s hellnoise is their lifestyle, notorious shouting alcoholics boozing as notorious alcoholics!
