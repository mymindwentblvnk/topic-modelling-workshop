Devon Baldwin is a pop singer from San Francisco, California. Bay Area native Devon Baldwin is a singer/songwriter who creates dreamy, sensuous pop songs with forward-thinking electronic production. 

The daughter of Windham Hill Records producer Dawn Atkinson, Baldwin grew up singing, attending music classes at private school Marin Academy and recording Kelly Clarkson-like pop/rock tunes in her early teens. In 2009, she auditioned for American Idol and made it to the top 52 contestants before being eliminated. 

After graduating from high school, she studied at Loyola University in New Orleans, earning a degree in music and singing opera. While at college, Baldwin met producer Christoph Andersson and rapper Gerald Gillum (G-Eazy), and began creating music with both, as well as becoming romantically involved with Gillum. Starting in 2011, Baldwin co-wrote and appeared on several G-Eazy songs, including 2014 hit "Let's Get Lost." 

She suffered a collapsed lung, requiring major surgery and temporarily derailing her career, but the hiatus gave her time to focus on writing lyrics. After successfully recuperating, she resumed singing and performing concerts, touring with her friend JMSN and appearing at festivals such as Austin's SXSW and the Outside Lands festival at San Francisco's Golden Gate Park. Baldwin released her debut EP, Lungs, in November of 2015.
