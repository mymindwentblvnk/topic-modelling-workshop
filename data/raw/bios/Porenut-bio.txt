Porenut was established by the end of 2008 as one man project, which had served to his author as a platform for realization of his perception of music and world. Despite the name, Porenut refuses each form of paganism (and other forms of religion and spirituality) and endorses the heritage of black metal, unspoiled with pipes and hurdy-gurdies. Vocalist Neplex (ex-Lugubris) joined Porenut in 2009 and world of twisted melodies became even more twisted, when accompanied by specific lyrical visions... In those days come to existence first drafts of songs, which became basis for album which is released (thanks to drummer R. Vrecn√≠k and despite approx. billion of problems) in 2012 - called Mislife. We (very, very) slowly started with preparations for next album...
