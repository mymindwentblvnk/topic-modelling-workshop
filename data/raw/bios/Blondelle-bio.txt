This is my band actually, so I'll write the first description. We are a guitar based rock band based in North London. We have been mates and playing together since we were 13/14 respectively. we love stuff like Smashing Pumpkins, Velvet Underground, Rolling Stones, Pixies, etc... we sound like us, and us alone, a unique blend of all our favourite music and all sorts of influences, totally juxtaposed with each other. check out our video on mtv2 and youtube. and go to our site:
