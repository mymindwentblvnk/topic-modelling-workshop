Karmaflow was initiated by composer Ivo van Dijk in 2012, and started out as a graduation project for him and 12 fellow students of the HKU University of the Arts Utrecht. The team strives to bring a new and unique way of telling interactive stories through the medium of videogames, and is taking it one step further by bringing the music of Karmaflow to stage.

Karmaflow: The Rock Opera Videogame is a full-blown interactive rock opera, and features singers from bands such as Dragonforce, Cradle of Filth, Epica, Sonata Arctica, Arch Enemy and more. The symphonic sound of the score is brought by the Dutch Metropole Orchestra.

A specially formed band will perform the music of Karmaflow on stage from October 2014 on. Strengthened by a string-quartet and an alternating cast of guest-singers (from the original cast which can be found in the game) the band will be performing on club-stages. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/KarmaFlow">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
