The band formed in 1987 originally as a Hardcore band called CHROMATIC DEATH. In early '88 they recorded a 10 track Rehearsal/Demo entitled 'Hoodycore' this was to be their only recording as Chromatic Death. In late 1988 they decided to change their name to MORAL CRUSADE and go in a more Thrash direction. They wrote and rehearsed a few new songs and recorded a four track demo entitled 'Immoral Condition', shortly after that their Bass player at the time Trev decided to leave the band so Mano, bassist from their Chromatic Death days took over. In '89 they recorded their only full length 9 track LP entitled 'An Act Of Violence' which was released in 1990. Finally in 1991 after a lot of gigs the band decided to take a break, but unfortunetly never got back together.
