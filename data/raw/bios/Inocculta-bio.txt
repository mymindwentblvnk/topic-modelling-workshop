Inocculta (R.I.P.) was a French-Belgian band mainly influenced by the European Rock/Metal scene (Opeth, Katatonia, Novembre, Moonspell, The Old Dead Tree). The compositions of Inocculta also include some Black Metal touchs, inspired by formations such like In The Woods and Forbidden Site.

This variety of influences shows the different paths the band followed before finding his own way with his first album, Before Withering, recorded and mixed by Maxime Libert at the Noise Factory studio in August 2007, and mastered by Alan Ward at the Electric City studio, Brussels in September 2007.

Formed in 2001, Inocculta had time, before this first album, to be on stage in several Belgian cities and major festivals like the Metal Blast at the Botanique, Brussels. The band played at this time an uncompromising Black Metal and released three demos applauded by Metal press and webzines. After line-up changes due to point of view divergences regarding the musical future of the band, Inocculta began in 2005 to train his new style, using both the most radical metal and the most melodic rock.

Before Withering is a diversified album, which tries to draw the right emotion, between rage and melancholy, from the different sources of metal. The music is supported by poetic texts, influenced by the Nietzschean philosophy, and more particularly by the idea that Man must be topped by Art and Will.

Mid-2009, Inocculta split up after eight years of presence on the Belgian metal scene. Geographical distance between members, evolution in musical tastes, busy professional life, unceasing line-up issues... : reasons explaining the end of Inocculta are numerous. This end does not come from relationship problems between founding members, who managed to remain bound together until the end. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Inocculta">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
