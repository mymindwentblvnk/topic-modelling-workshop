Early in 2004, three members of the now-disbanded band ABSURD : Eric Martelat (lead-singer and song-writer), Mickäel Colignon (guitarist and backup vocalist) and JC Zurun (bass-player) decide to form MESSALINE, along with the drummer Stéphane Cordovado.

Late ABSURD released two albums: "Pour un Oui Pour un Nom" in 2001, produced by ADIPOCERE and "Dernières Sommations" in 2003, produced by BRENNUS. Both albums were warmly welcomed at the time by the French Rock and Metal press. ABSURD played as support band for bands as varied as ANGE, PORCUPINE TREE, HELLSUCKERS, FOR ABSENT FRIENDS or DYSLESIA ...

But now comes the time for MESSALINE! A continuity in the spirit (as regards the lyrics, still tragic and comic and always original) but with a definitely more Heavy Rock style of music. Energy, power and melodies are the master words!

MESSALINE... Sulphurous? Debauched? Politically incorrect ? No, just Rock'n'Roll!
