Symphonic black metal from Nantes, Pays de la Loire, France.  Released one demo in 1999 titled "Prelude to the Epic of Gilgamesh: Enkidu, Born of Mud," before splitting up.

"The aim of Orpheus in Mourning was "to shape a vast, two-hour long 'symphony' recreating the very ancient Epic of Gilgamesh." (which never came to be, obviously.)

The original text wasn't preserved well, however, and was very hard to understand, so it was rewritten here so that the lyrics could be easily understood, but still tell the same tale."

Lineup:
Fabrice Auffray - Bass
Gwenole Michenaud - Drums, Percussion
Philippe Colin - Vocals, Guitars, Keyboards, Violin <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Orpheus+In+Mourning">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
