Kleenex (name later changed to Liliput) were a Swiss post-punk/new wave band active from 1978 to 1983. 

The group formed in 1978 under the name Kleenex, and soon made a name for themselves, until the threat of legal action by Kimberly-Clark in 1979 prompted a change of name to LiLiPUT (Kleenex being a propietry brand of tampons in Switzerland). Their initial line-up was consisted of Regula Sing (vocals), Marlene Marder (guitar), Klaudia Schiff (bass) and Lislot Ha (drums), and in the late 1970s the band recorded a number of successful singles prior to Sing’s departure. In 1982, after playing together for four years, LiLiPUT released their first self-titled full-length LP on Rough Trade.

In 2001, Kill Rock Stars released a 46-track double-disc CD spanning five years of LiLiPUT’s recordings, starting in 1978 when they were still under the name of Kleenex. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Kleenex">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
