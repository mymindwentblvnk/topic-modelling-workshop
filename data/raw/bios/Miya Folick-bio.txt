Miya Folick (born in Santa Ana, CA) is an American singer-songwriter and musician based in Los Angeles. She released her first EP "Strange Darling" in May, 2015. She is half-Japanese and half-Russian and was raised as a Jōdo Shinshū Buddhist, learning to play the taiko drums in a church group.

Self describing her songs as a fusion between grunge and folk, she brings dreamy melodies and slightly confessional lyrics that, along with her discreet charm, are bound to get any music lover hooked.

As a young adult, Los Angeles-based singer/songwriter Miya Folick was drawn to music as a creative outlet because of its ability to combine emotional and intellectual content. Bringing contemplative lyrics to intense indie rock, her debut EP, Strange Darling, was released in 2015.

A native of Santa Ana, California, Folick attended New York University after graduating high school, but eventually started skipping classes, opting to spend her time exploring the city by herself. After dropping out and moving back home, she spent the remainder of the semester learning to play the guitar. Her first EP, the self-produced Strange Darling, was recorded by Mark Rains (Alice Bag, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club) at his Station House Studio in Echo Park. It saw release in 2015. Folick's second EP, Give It to Me, followed on Terrible Records in 2017 and included a cover of Joni Mitchell's "Woodstock." Inspired by reading an article about abusive power structures, the defiant "Deadbody" arrived in March 2018, with the synth poppier "Stock Image" following that June in advance of her debut LP. In the meantime, she toured in support of Kate Nash.
