Demonical Crisis Assembly (DCA) was formed together by Gorgomieth and Waxs Witchell in 2002 to create an aggressive and brutal black metal music through the sounds of 'war'. In 2005 DCA released their debut EP,'Blood War Death' containing 5 tracks of pure and brutal black metal music. It's a blast for the entire band as they managed to build a strong fanbase in the Malaysian metal scene.

Recently, the band took a major step by cutting a deal with a South Korean Distro and Production, Infernal Kaos Production (IKP) to distribute DCA's material globally. IKP will re-release DCA's Blood War Death EP plus 2 bonus tracks and expected to terrorize the metal scene worldwide by end of this year. The re-releasing of our debut EP will be a major stepping stone for us to spreading the thirst of blood to each and every land possible in order to gain more experience and feedbacks from the fans.

Currently DCA are still working on the new material , preparing themselves for the next battle!!! The band's first full length album under IKP will be unleashed next year. Expect more BLOOD WAR and DEATH!!!! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Demonical+Crisis+Assembly">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
