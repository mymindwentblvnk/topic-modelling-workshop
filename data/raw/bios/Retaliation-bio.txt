There's more than one artist with this name:

1. Swedish Grindcore-Band
"RTLN formed back in 1993 .. now it's been almost 15 years and thus far we've managed to produce two demos (on tape of course), five 7" eps (of which one is STILL unreleased), one 12" and 3 mcd's (and one of those is also STILL unreleased) and one full length CD. ...We would like to think that we put out some swedish quality grindcore. a bit more brutal than the rest, a little crazier than the rest. and when we put out new stuff we'd like to think that people want it. they need it. they CRAVE it. Coz it IS brutal, it IS CRAZY and goddammit it IS AWESOME! though they might not admit it now, band like Nasum and Regurgitate are influenced by us. and if THAT isn't telling you something..."
