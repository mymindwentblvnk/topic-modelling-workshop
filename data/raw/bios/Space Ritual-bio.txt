Space Ritual is a rock band formed by former Hawkwind singer and saxophonist Nik Turner. It routinely features former Hawkwind musicians and plays old Hawkwind tracks. The group was originally called xHawkwind but this was changed following legal action by Turner's old Hawkwind co-founder Dave Brock. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Space+Ritual">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
