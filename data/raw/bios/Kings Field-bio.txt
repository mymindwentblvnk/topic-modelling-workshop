KINGS FIELD was started in the summer of 2004, with keyboard player Emilio and lead guitarist Eddie, in El Paso TX. Previous to the start, Eddie and Emilio were playing for their former bands, Emilio in Malac and Eddie in Atherios, wanting a more power/progressive sound Eddie began playing for Malac. As that started, Atherios split up and the band Malac wasn't moving forward. Frustrated; Emilio and Eddie started working on material and writing together for a couple months. Knowing that El Paso didn't have the resources for them to progress, they both decided to move to the "Metal City" Phoenix, AZ. There, they found legendary Gary on drums, masterful Andrew on Guitars, super righteous Gabe on Bass, and the unreal Vocals of Rene'e. Kings Field has established a great name for themselves playing on some incredible live shows, much thanks to our good friends. Kings Field has had the privilege to share a stage with some mind-blowing artist like: Nevermore, Kamelot, Hammerfall, Primal Fear, Epica, Chris Poland, Finntroll, Sonata Arctica and two Warped Tour gigs two years in a row, one of which being Kings Fields first gig! Now the band is concentrating on releasing an album "The Perfect Balance, due in a few weeks and working on bigger accomplishments! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kings+Field">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
