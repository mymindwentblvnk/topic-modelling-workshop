Heathen Beast believes in no god and no religion. We write about the world and it's religion as we see it, we write about how it encompass and controls the masses in our country India. Our music symbolizes self belief and the fact that we choose our own path and make our own destiny. There is no God that writes your life and not everything that is bad in this world is a consequence of that karma. You are responsible. Heathen Beast plays a form of brutal metal to connect with those who think like we do. The Heathen Beast Shall Be Unleashed Upon Thee.

Heathen Beast is the formation of three.

Carvaka who believes religion was invented and made up by men, having no divine authority.

Samkhya who denies the existence of God.

Mimamsa who rejects the notion of God and says that human action itself is enough to create the necessary circumstances for the enjoyment of its fruits.
