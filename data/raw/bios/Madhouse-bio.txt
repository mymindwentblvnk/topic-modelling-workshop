There is more than one artist that goes by the name Madhouse:

1) Madhouse was the name of a post-punk band which lasted from 1983 to 1986, fronted by Monica Richards.  In 1984, after recording and releasing Madhouse (their self-titled album) on FOY Records, they became a staple of the Washington, D.C., punk scene.  They joined other dark 1980s punk bands, including Xmal Deutschland, TSOL, and UK Decay, in the underground scene of the time.

2) Madhouse was a four-piece instrumental funk/jazz fusion band masterminded by Prince and consisting of his cohorts Eric Leeds, John Lewis, Levi Seacer Jr., and Matt Fink. In 1987, they released two albums: 8 and 16. All tracks were titled by their track number: e.g., One, Two, etc. Both albums carry eight tracks.

3) Madhouse was an early 1970s funk outfit led by Gary 'Mudbone' Cooper, who would later co-found Bootsy's Rubber Band with legendary P-Funk bassist Bootsy Collins. Madhouse churned out a mix of heavy rock-infused funk, a la early Funkadelic, and spaced-out soul jazz jammings. Their 1972 album, Serve 'Em, a righteous anti-Richard Nixon treatise, is now highly collectible.
