Lapageria Rosea is a Chilean black metal project formed by Furufuhué in early 2010 from Puerto Montt. 

The band name comes from the binomial name of the chile's national flower "Copihue", for this reason, the lyrics have a strong focus naturalist and other abstract concepts away from the black metal itself. 

All released done to date are completely experimental, low budget, low-fidelity recorded and self-produced by Furufuhué. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lapageria+Rosea">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
