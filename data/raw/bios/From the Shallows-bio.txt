From The Shallows was founded two years ago with co-existing members of Metal/hardcore acts-The Dawning, The Black Dahlia Murder, Thumbscrew, and Let it Die. Bringing a heavier sound than their previous acts before them, the band has made a name for themselves by playing many shows in various cities of Ohio,and Michigan. The band has seen many members come and go throughout the past 2 years and has now established a final solidified line-up. Now pushing forward towards success, the band plans to keep doing what they know best. Playing the music that they love. With meaning and purpose behind their music they plan to continue making a name for themselves throughout the music industry. They are the Tribunal Record label along with many other great bands such as: KillWhitneyDead, The Damascus Intervention, The Demonstration, Liferuiner, Woe Of Tyrants, and much more. They just released their first album, Beyond The Unknown, hopefully there will be many more to come.
