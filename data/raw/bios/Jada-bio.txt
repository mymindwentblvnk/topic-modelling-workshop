In January 2006, Jada worked in New York with Grammy-nominated producer/songwriter Toby Gad (Fergie (singer), Beyoncé, Natasha Bedingfield).[2][13][14] Jada worked with Gad to co-write the ballad, “Is It Love”. Jada traveled to studios all over the country, from New York City and Atlanta to Miami and Los Angeles, collaborating with such superstars as RedOne, Akon, Danja (musician), Wyclef Jean, Swizz Beatz and J.R. Rotem.[1][3][13][14][15][16] They also worked with Jordan Omley from production/songwriting team The Jam (production team) (Leona Lewis, Jennifer Hudson, Jordin Sparks) yielded “The Problem With Love,” “If You Wanna (written by Ryan Tedder of One Republic),” and the inspirational “Hold On”.[2][13][14] An alliance with UK team Wayne Wilkins, Andrew Frampton, and Savan Kotecha (Natasha Bedingfield, Carrie Underwood) resulted in the mid tempo “Break Up Song” and club track “Play a Playa,” while New york City hit-makers Sturken & Rodgers (Christina Aguilera, Rihanna) contributed the ballad, "Shattered.” [3][10][13][14] Later, “Can’t Let Go,” was co-written by Jada and Ric Poulin.[2][13][14][17] In 2006, the group signed to Universal Motown.

And they did; homegirls look hotter in person than in press shots (one even has a little Jess Alba thing going on), and, unlike manufactured hoaxes like Destiny’s Child, every last one of them can belt and grind.” [6]
