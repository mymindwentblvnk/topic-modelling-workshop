No bullshit stoner-doom from Bangalore, India, with an undeniable '70s heavy rock foundation. The band plays catchy tunes with thick riffs, groovy rhythms, melodic solos, and raspy vocals. They basically fucking bring it.

The samples featured here are rough rehearsal takes, the band is working on these and many more songs that would eventually make up their debut release.
