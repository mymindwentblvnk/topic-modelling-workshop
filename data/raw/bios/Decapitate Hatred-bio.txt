Decapitate Hatred was formed in 2010, it all began from the friendship of three young school boys who are passionate in death metal, they are Pidekso Gentur Satriaji as a guitarist, Andrian Pratama as a drummer, and Betta Anugrah Wibawa as vocalist. Since then, we recorded two songs entitled “The New World Order” and “Majelis Kemunafikan”. Then, we knew that we doesn't have any bass player in our formation, Amril Maulana who is our friend since highschool filled the position. As the time goes by, we've tried to made a new color in our material and "Demon Possession" as the expression. It's a lot different with the first two singles because this is influenced by brutal death metal band such as Disgorge(US), Disavowed, Cerebral Effusion, etc. Shortly after “Demon Possession” released, Abel decide to sign off from the band because of some reasons. Since then, Pidekso Gentur Satriaji takes a double job as guitarist and vocalist. 

In mid-2011, we’ve recorded five songs at K studio Bekasi with Amril Maulana now as a vocalist and no longer as a bassist. But after that, one of our pioneer, Andrian Pratama decide to quit from the band because of some reasons. So we took Angga Endar(Hitam Pudar) as a drummer. In the year 2012, Brutal Infection Records began to know about the band’s existence and interested in releasing our first EP album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Decapitate+Hatred">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
