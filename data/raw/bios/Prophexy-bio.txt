The band breaks the progressive rock scenes, both Italian and European, taking part in the offical King Crimson tribute album ‘The letters: an Italian unconventional guide to King Crimson’, produced in 2005 by Mellow Records and along with artists like the virtuoso piano-player Stefano Bollani. Their version of ‘The great deceiver’ turns out to be greatly appreciated by the audience and the press.
‘Scartomanzia’, a five songs EP, is recorded in the band’s own studio in 2006. Thanks to this release, PropheXy places first in a contest promoted by the ‘Acid Jazz’ magazine. As a part of the prize, the song ‘Plasticosmic‘ is then included in the August issue.
New and important opportunities follow, like concerts with Anekdoten, Le Orme, Sleepy Time Gorilla Museum, Deus Ex Machina, Maschera di Cera, Accordo dei Contrari, among the others.
After a lot of electric and some acoustic gigs, PropheXy enters again the studio to produce the new full-lenght album ‘Alconauta’.
A mix of crazy textures and mad rhythms, highly melodic and psychedelic openings lead to a new breed of Pro-Aggressive Rock. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/PropheXy">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
