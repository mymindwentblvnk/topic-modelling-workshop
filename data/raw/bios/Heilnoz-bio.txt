HEILNOZ borns as a one man band about three years ago with the creation of some songs that didn't fit on his past band. After leaving that band he recorded three tracks for a demo tape with the collaboration of Aboriorth (session drums - ABORIORTH, NOCTURNAL HELL), Abhorym (session vocals) and H. (lyrics).

HEILNOZ plays pagan black metal in the vein of JUDAS ISCARIOT, KAMPFAR & ULVER. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Heilnoz">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
