All Rise
The band released their debut single All Rise which sold more than 1.300.000 copies on May 21, 2001 and the song rose to number four on the British Top 40. 
Blue released their next single, Too Close (a cover version of Next's song), on August 27, 2001 and this song was Blue's first number one single. 
After the CD single Too Close there were two new singles from the album All Rise; If you Come Back and Fly By II (which is a remix of Fly By). Those singles sold more than 200.000 copies in the UK. 

One Love
The band released a new single and album, in the summer of 2002, both called One Love which was the most popular Blue's album, selling more than 3.000.000 copies.
