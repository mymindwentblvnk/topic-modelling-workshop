Impiety's diabolical birth began in Singapore in January 1990 with: Shyaithan (bass/vocals), XXXul (guitars) and Iblyss (battery), under heavy influence of Sodom, early Bathory, early Sarcofago, early Possessed, early Morbid Angel, Incubus (FL), Blasphemy and Sextrash etc.

Impiety recorded & released a 5 song promo tape in 1992 entitled 'Ceremonial Necrochrist Redesecration' which, despite its low-fi production, was positively received and praised very well in the metal underground worldwide. In 1993, Impiety signed a contract with Shivadarshana records. XXXul, left the band & was replaced by Leprophiliac Rex. The band's first diabolical release with Shivadarshana was the 'Salve the Goat ... Iblis Excelsi' 7" in 1994. The response to the single was overwhelming & all 3000 copies were sold out, with 500 licensed to Fudgeworthy Records (U.S.) released on limited marble-vinyl. These 2 different pressings of this diabolical 7" are long sold out.

After the 7" release a 4th member, Abyydos, was recruited to give Impiety a full fuckin' powerful infernal nuclear sound. Abyydos played lead and rhythm guitar, Leprophiliac Rex played bass, Iblyss played drums with Shyaithan on vocals. With this line-up, 'Asateerul Awaleen', the quartet's debut CD album of 8 fucking Black witching HellMetal tracks, was recorded in 1995 & released in 1996 under Shivadarshana. 'Asateerul Awaleen' sold out all 4000 copies pressed on digipak CD and the response (reviews) from most major magazines were more than satisfying & undeniably incredible. Impiety also recorded a 5-song MCD entitled 'Funeralight...' due for release early in 1997 exclusively by Shivardarshana, but Shivadarshana ran into financial problems and shut down. However a limited edition cassette-MLP of 2500 copies was pressed by independent label Ultra~Hingax Productions from Malaysia.

Ultra~Hingax Productions never had good distribution channels worldwide and so there was much disappointment to Impiety's hellhordes, as 'Funeralight...' never did see the light in Europe/US. Shortly after the 'Funeralight...' recording, Shyaithan kicked Iblyss out after a dispute & at the same time, Abyydos had to leave as he had been called up for compulsory military service. Frontman Shyaithan, appointed new demonlords to the line~up, namely Fyraun and Dajjal. Fyraun (guitars) was quick to learn all Impiety songs and so was Dajjal (battery). Both had been long playing in various Black/Death metal outfits prior to joining. The band immediately started delivering live shows with the new lineup and all shows generated excellent response from truest of barbarians, warmongering fans and press alike.
