Vaee Solis is a band that fits Morrigan's martial howling invoking the liberation and illumination of the eternal night, represented in Scandinavian traditions by Ragnarok. Its Sun is the polar Black Sun that shines bright like a diamond on Lucifer's forehead. Sophia's voice is, therefore, a hoarse and inflamed appeal to all human beings, slaves of the heavy forgetful slumber to which they have been condemned to by industrial society, to rise like Titans to their nocturnal awakening. Lamia's apotropaic shriek, lined by melancholic yet intensely melodic bards provided in the shadows with long and phallic guitars, takes away all fear of the inertia of merely being human. Then, ancient and atavic memories rise again, stealthily like wolves, coming from the visceral core of ourselves, inflaming our blood and hardening our muscles. Only then the awakening comes and in the eternal night we remember that we indeed are Gods. - Gilberto de Lascariz <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vaee+Solis">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
