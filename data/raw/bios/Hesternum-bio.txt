Hesternum (formerly Nebelthon) is a solo-project that emerged from the depths of consciousness in 2005 near Nuremberg. After many rather short experimental tracks various other musicians - especially t. winter - were engaged to add some personal contribution to this project. Since 2008 some things have changed: Hesternum returned to its solo-project state again (with results such as "ambivalenz II", "journey II", "immerfeste" and "kainzelle") and is now based in Austria/Innsbruck since September 2009. The first Demo (self-titled) is available since July 2010.
