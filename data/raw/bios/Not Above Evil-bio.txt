Warriors of the World Unite! Hailing from mighty trinidad, ferocious hungary and erm... Doncaster, Not Above Evil are fast becoming as popular as yo-yo's. 

Daniel Mucs, the caveman turned skin basher, astounds with lightning fast double bass and forehead creasing to make a bear swoon. 

Sideeq Mohammed, the intellectual rasta/metalhead, rumbles away on the corner causing bass like dirges called heart attacks. 

David Gwynn, disciple of pin (from sikth) descends from the wastes of doncaster to destroy the infidels with razor sharp shredding and tasteful use of powerchords! 


David Horton, the ''New Guy'' (c), adds another dimension to the ferocious firepower unleashed from spiked axes. He also has the novelty of being the only band member from manchester.
