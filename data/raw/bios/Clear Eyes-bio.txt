Clear Eyes is an 18-year-old American dream-pop/shoegaze producer. His sound is wrought with ethereal synths, ghostly vocals, and slow (yet driving) hip-hop inspired beats. Formerly known as Marathon, Clear Eyes draws influences from artists like Tycho, Balam Acab, Baths, and Shlohmo and has been compared to M83 stylistically. He released his first official EP, Agony in June of 2012 and is due for a full length in the later part of the year. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Clear+Eyes">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
