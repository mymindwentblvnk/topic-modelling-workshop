Satus is Black Metal, devoted to the supremacy of Nature and the magic of our ancient European Heritage. This band is hateful and misanthropic, but believe in a rebirth in purity following modern humanity's coming ruin. Their art is growing and developing as they descend deeper into the roots of their souls. The bands genesis came in December 2004, and have progressed from there. The band was formed by Lycaon(guitars) and Belleme(drums, vox, and synth) for the purpose of creating music to channel their energies. Fel was brought in on bass, creating a mold in the band. They recorded two demo's, 'Cacaphony in Void' and their split with Tailiesin, 'Heathen Soul', and played shows around Tacoma and Seattle. Fel left the band in July 2007 because of personal differences, and for 'hired gun' purposes, Virfernus was brought in on bass as was Morder on second guitar. Five new songs were created, two live shows played including opening for the inaugural year for the Hot August Metal Fest in Seattle. Plans were to be set, then Morder left in early November 2007 due to military duties, and the band is currently in search of a practice spot again, and then going into reclusion to record. Satus is soley Lycaon and Belleme's entity. They are they minds who drive this band. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Satus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
