Clouds Disperse formed in September 2005, the band consists of just two members, who create all the music by themselves. The band went straight into recording and piecing together their first release "Planet". The albums lyrics dive head first into a complex concept featuring many different themes, some of which include War, Religion, Binary oppositions and inner struggles on a mass scale.

The band have wasted no time at all and have already started work on their second album "Revenge Of The Sun". Upon first hearing of the first song "Manipulating Mankind" it is clear the band are going for a heavier, more evil sound. With this new album the band hope to add a progressive element to their music and more complex song structures. Once again the lyrics revolve around a concept, this time the concept is alot closer to home, Mankind finds out their existance is the purpose of an alien controlled experiment. A most chilling and thought provoking concept inspired by the expieriences of John Lear.

Their music can be considered as Atmospheric Melodic Death Metal as the band draws influences from other artists like In Flames, Dark Tranquility, Scar Symmetry etc... <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Clouds+Disperse">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
