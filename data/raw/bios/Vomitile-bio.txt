Vomitile is a Death metal band from Cyprus that was established in the early summer of 2007 by Khatch Yildizian and Panos Larkou.

After a numerous amount of live shows and some line up changes Vomitile entered the studio in 2009 with their previous line up ( Panos Larkou - Guitars, Khatch Yildizian - Bass, Yiannis Gregoriou - Vocals, Mustafa Tangul - Drums) to record there first self financed and self released 7 track EP, Rotting Life.

Just shortly after the new year (2010) and the recording of the Rotting Life EP, Mustafa Tangul was dismissed from his duties on the drums due to personal reasons. However Vomitile didn't give up and decided to move on and replace him with a new and more powerful drummer. After a few weeks of searching, the band found the missing link. His name was Hugo, a Death Metal drummer hailing from Mexico! The band also decided to recruit a second guitarist. That person is the twin brother of the band's bassist, George Yildizian.

Now Vomitile are complete once again and are working hard for up coming gigs and are also writing new mind blowing material!  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vomitile">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
