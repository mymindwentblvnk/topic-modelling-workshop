Kauf self-released 2 songs, Relocate and When You're Out, in 2011, with heavy drum production, dense, cinematic synth buildups and his own high-pitched, echo-laden vocals. They found their way to Dan Whitford of Cut Copy, who soon after signed Kauf to Cutters Records for a 4 song EP. This led to DJ sets around his home base, Los Angeles, premiering his live show at Mexico City's M.N. Roy, followed by shows at LA venues like El Rey Theatre and The Roxy, a remix of Tony Castles for Lost in Records, feature film sync licensing, and scoring music for a video on Nowness.com.

His first EP, As Much Again, was released on Cutters records in July 2013, and his full length debut is nearing completion. His first single, Relocate, has been remixed by Moons (No Recordings), Psychemagik (Psychemagik), Nile Delta (Cutters), and Mind Enterprises (Double Denim).

He is also about to release a remix for Moons on No Recordings.
