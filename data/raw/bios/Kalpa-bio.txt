2) Kalpa is a one man black metal band from Suwon - South Korea, created by Black Candle who started making music in 1996. They released their EP 'The Path of the Eternal Years' in 2002 on Tragic Serenade records, and also have 2 tracks featured on a compilation. Their style of black metal is fairly fast but also symphonic, similar to the likes of Emperor & Abigor, early Dimmu Borgir, Troll and Covenant, though with a lot more ferocity than the later. There are also two tracks by the band on the Deflower compilation in 1998, along with Black Syndrome, PHNDOE & L.P.G., these are a lot more symphonic.
