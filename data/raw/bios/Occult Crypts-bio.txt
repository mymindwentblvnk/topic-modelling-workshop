What started off as a Black Metal band entitled "Sektor"  (Which was a claimed name by too many other projects) evolved into a Black Metal project called Occult Crypts, which hails from the cold winds of North Bay Ontario. With Rotting Corpse on Vocals and Bass, and Funeral Ghoul on Drum Kit, Guitar, Backing Vocals and Synth (that was the line-up for the demo Spawn Of The Macabre). Occult Crypts plays a mixture of most subgenres of black metal, they are not confined to one style of black metal. If you read this description switch all your "Occult Crypts" tags with "Sign Of The Raven" that is the current band's name for the members listed below.

As of October 2012 Sign Of The Raven has disbanded. After playing some shows and being signed to Archaic North Entertainment, RC and FG decided it would be best to stop Sign due to all band members slow decent into uninterest. Even though spilt up, Sign Of The Raven had opportunities to open up for bands such as Hallows Die, Panzerfaust, Pagan Ritual, and Abriosis, For More information or Merch updates Contact Rotting Corpse at signoftheraven@hotmail.com.
