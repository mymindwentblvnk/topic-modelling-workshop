Somewhere between the mountainous landscapes of Pennsylvania and the forest combed valleys of New Jersey, Duskmourn was formed in 2012. Comprised of Walter Deyo (Guitars, Bass, and vocals) and Bill Sharpe (Guitars, Drums, Keyboards), Duskmourn’s vision has always been to create music that will transcend it’s listeners to another world…a simpler world…of ancient tales & nature bound journeys.

It all started in early 2012, with a couple of awesome demo songs, pizza, and a lot of beer. After the demo songs were refined & rehearsed, Duskmourn entered the studio to record their first self titled EP. With help fromformer members David Heer and Jeni Sharpe the demo was finished and completed by mid 2012.

Writing on 2014′s Legends commenced immediately after finishing the Duskmourn EP. With a vision to create a larger, more vast atmosphere, Duskmourn turned to it’s folk/natural roots to tell their story. With the recording’s now complete for it’s first full length album “Legends”, the album is set to be released by late 2014.
