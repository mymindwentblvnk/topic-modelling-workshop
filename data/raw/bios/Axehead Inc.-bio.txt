Axehead Inc got it's start when Bryan's former band was auditioning drummers. That's when he met Eric. The former band, Reborn, was short lived, but Bryan and Eric seemed to click as friends and musicians. They auditioned guitar players for months before Miles answered an ad they put in the classifieds of the New Union's web site. Miles, also of Crimson Thorn, turned out to be the perfect guitar player for Axehead Inc. He brought along Andy Kopesky from Crimson Thorn the next week at practice. Andy's playing complimented the playing of Miles and we started to forge our sound. Eric's friend, Jason Paterson, played bass guitar for a while, before having to quit due to family obligations. Luke then joined us and played bass.

Not long after that, Andy decided to "retire" and concentrate on playing in the Praise band in his church. Miles then suggested Luke take Andy's place on guitar. So now we're forging ahead with Luke on guitar... and new to Axehead Inc. is our new bass player, Mitch Hansen!

We all have a heart for reaching people with the good news and message of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ. While we are a Christian band, we are primarily a metal band and plan on playing at a lot of different types of clubs and other venues. We plan on rocking Minnesota and possibly some of the surrounding states. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Axehead+Inc.">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
