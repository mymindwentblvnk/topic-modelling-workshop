American beatsmith Andrew Dunbar Field-Pickering from Maryland releases low-tempo grooves on labels Future Times and Ramp Recordings since 2008 with traces of house, hip hop and disco.
Though relatively new to the world of electronic music production, Dunbar has been an active musician for years, having gotten his start rapping under the pseudonym Vulture Voltaire. His tracks nowadays lean toward sunny, slo-mo house, though the the occasional syncopated rhythm still betrays his hip hop roots.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Maxmillion+Dunbar">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
