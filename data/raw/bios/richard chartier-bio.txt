Richard Chartier (USA, 1971), also known as Pinkcourtesyphone, is an ultra-minimalist composer who, starting with "Direct, Incidental, Consequental" (Intransitive Recordings, 1998 - 3particles, 2003), focused on "silence music" a la Bernhard GÃ¼nter and "deep listening" a la Oliveros.

His microscopic exploration of the space between sounds and silence, is best exemplified by his fourth solo album "Series" (Line, 2000) and by "Decisive Forms" (Trente Oiseaux, 2001). They are made of barely audible events in a digital soundscape; of "implied sounds". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Richard+Chartier">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
