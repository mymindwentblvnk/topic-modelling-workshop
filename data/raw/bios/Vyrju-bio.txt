Vyrju is an international band project with base in Norway. It was started as a one man band by Jan F. Lindsø (Gjenferdsel), and the first melodies were created in 2006.

Their debut EP is entitled 'Black'. All instruments are performed by Jan F. Lindsø, except drums and clean vocals which are performed by Tim Yatras (Germ, Austere, ex-Nazxul, ex-Woods of Desolation etc.) which appears as a session musician.

The EP has received a lot of great reviews, like 5/6 in Zero Tolerance issue 62 and amazing feedback from Terrorizer amongst other.
