Deathbound formed in 1995 under the name of Twilight. They released two demos under this name entitled Twilight and Melancholy of Northern Landscapes. After this, they changed their name to Unbound and released another demo entitled Flames of Madness. A further name changed saw their name finally stick on Deathbound. Under this name they released one more demo entitled Elaborate the Torture. This saw the band sign to Woodcut Records and release their first album, entitled To Cure the Sane with Insanity. The band then signed to Dynamic Arts Records and did a split album with Death/Thrash band Deathchain, see Deathbound/Deathchain Split 2005. The band then went on to release their second album, this time with record label Dynamic Arts Records, entitled Doomsday Comfort. Doomsday Comfort featured the guest vocals of Mieszko Talarczyk, vocalist and guitarist of Swedish Grindcore band Nasum. This was the last project Mieszko worked on before his tragic death during the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. Deathbound released their most recent album We Deserve Much Worse in 2007.

The band originally played a style of music known as Deathgrind, which combines Grindcore and Death Metal. However, their more recent album We Deserve Much Worse has seen the band drop the Death Metal elements of their music in favour of a faster-paced Grindcore style. The lyrics of the band ussually deal with death, insanity and violence. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Deathbound">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
