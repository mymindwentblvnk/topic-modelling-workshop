Pyphomgertum is a mexican band, formed around 1992. They released 2 demos before being signed to Bellphegot Records, who first released a splity release with Swedish band Dawn, called "The Dark Light"/"The Eternal Forest". 

2 years later the debut album of Pyphomgertum was released by the same label, entitled "Gorific Carnal Confessions". Line-up changes plagued the band after that, and when the second album was to be recorded only 2 members were still with the band. They ended the band, but the material would be recorded anyway, now under the name Bloodreaping.
