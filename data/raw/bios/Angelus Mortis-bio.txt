Angelus Mortis was founded in 1998. After many Line-Up changes the Band is now complete and in December 2005 the Record Session for their upcoming CD called "Venerable Grey Epitaph" was finished! Angelus Mortis consists of members of Cryptic Wintermoon, ex-Violation, ex-Homicidal Violence and ex-Astaroth. We try to mix up our different favourite styles of metal to a kind of melting pot which contains elements of Thrash, Death and Black Metal. Angelus Mortis played with following Bands: NAPALM DEATH,GRAVEWORM,HYPNOS,SHADOWCAST,RAGE,LETZTE INSTANZ,M.I.GOD,FLESHCRAWL,DISILLUSION,KNORKATOR,DARK DAY DUNGEON,CRYPTIC WINTERMOON,JACK SLATER,DEAD etc. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Angelus+Mortis">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
