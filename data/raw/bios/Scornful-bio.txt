There are least two metal bands named Scornful:

1) A metal band from Trondheim inspired by Converge, High On Fire and Mastodon. In 2011 they released "Waiting", a release that resulted in showcase on Trondheim Calling in 2012 as well as the band got recommended by NRK Ur√∏rt. In addition Pyro named them as one of the most promising bands in 2012. New material is coming May 22, 2014. The band promises a more progressive and harder sound compared to their debut release. 

2) An upcoming underground deathmetal group from Denmark. 

They met eachother at a highschool in Denmark and began some jamming. After a while the former members, Simon Kannegaard (lead guitar) and Frederik Fabricius (drums) decided to start a real band. Now one yeah later they have almost finished their demo work including 7  hardcore powerful deathmetal tracks with their new improved lineup. 

Now Scornful is working on new material..
Since the beginning the music has changed a little. Its a lot more technical and has a more powerful, brutal touch than the old tracks. Due to their vocalist, who has developed a new agressive style of singing, the band has now created a whole new  sound and style.
Fans of  straightup death/thrashmetal can look foward to a massive attack including tons of solo's , blastbeats and some f**king evil vocals.

Stay tuned
