There are multiple artists with this name:
1. A heavy metal band formed in Arvika, Sweden, 2004, currently based in Stockholm. They have released four full length albums, are active and currently signed to Nuclear Blast records.

Enforcer plays and performs in a style very similar to older speed metal bands like Agent Steel, Exciter and Anvil. When the Sweden Rock Magazine asked them about playing 'old school', they answered "heavy metal isn't old school, it's timeless". After releasing two demos in 2005 (which were entirely created and played by Olof Wikstrand), he recruited band members Jakob Ljungberg on drums, Jonas Wikstrand on bass, and Adam Zaars on guitar. With this lineup in place, they re-recorded two previously released songs for the 'Speed Kills... Again' split on Heavy Artillery records. Shortly after, Joseph Tholl was recruited to play bass, Jonas replaced Jakob on drums, and their debut album Into the Night was released Heavy Artillery in late 2008. 
This album caught the attention of Earache records who signed them and released the critically and fan-acclaimed album Diamonds in 2010, on which another shuffling of the line up occurred: Tobias Lindqvist joined to play bass and Joseph switched to guitar. 
Before their third album was released, Adam Zaars left to concentrate on Tribulation and Olof took up the slack - again playing guitar - on Death By Fire, released early February 2013 on Nuclear Blast. Their fourth album, From Beyond was released late February 2015, again on Nuclear Blast.
