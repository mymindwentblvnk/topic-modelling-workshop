Zerfetzer was found in Weilheim (in bavaria, germany and "The new Seattle, musically", according to „The Wire“) about 3 years ago. The sound ranges from classical Heavy Metal and Hard Rock to Punk, Death- and Thrash Metal, whereas textual they only pursue one aim - to tell bullshit, that other bands broadcast unintended. 
What is serious or ill-intentioned by others, is funny and entertaining by Zerfetzer! 
The spectrum ranges from dadaistic nonsense to filed short-stories. 
That’s why the appellation „Uncontrolled-Blöd-Metal“ (uncontrolled-dumb-metal) is very apposite. 
Fun with music is to the fore - and you’re definitely going to have fun with Zerfetzer!
