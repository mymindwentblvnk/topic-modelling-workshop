Peggy Gou (born 1990) is a Berlin based Korean artist. Through a regular stream of high quality mixes she has begun to turn heads in underground circles. Sitting somewhere between Detroit, London and Berlin in sound, her DJ sets are a assured, kinetic combination of dark, pulsing house and techno, broken beats and abstract compositions.  

She released her first EPs in 2016, and continues to be active as a DJ and producer.  Her best known track, “It Makes You Forget (Itgehane),” was released in 2018, and was reviewed in Pitchfork as "fresh, stylish, and full of depth." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/PEGGY+GOU">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
