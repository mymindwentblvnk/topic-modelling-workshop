There are three artists known as Novena:

1. Tennessee based rock band
2. Progressive metal band formed from the ashes of Bleeding Oath in 2013.
3. Short lived Long Island rock band.

1. Having shared the stage with the likes of Sevendust, Adema, Tricky and 3 Doors Down, Cookeville, Tenn.-based Novena’s roots can be traced back to 1999, when childhood friends Brad Hensley and Seth Robertson decided to team up on a few electronic-influenced tracks as ‘evendeeper.’ Soon, Hensley and Robertson added Sam Hawkins (drums) and Will Smith (bass) to the ranks of evendeeper, and took to the local music scene. Having enjoyed widespread airplay on many of the mid-state’s most well-known rock radio stations, the band earned a spot on 102.9 FM’s Buzzfest 2 at Starwood Amphitheatre in Nashville. The band appeared alongside artists including Mesh, Nickelback, Tricky, Ben Folds and Sevendust. On Halloween night of 2004, the new line-up – now known by its current moniker – Novena made its debut, departing from the 90s sound of evendeeper.

2. UK based progressive metal band Novena began in 2013 in the aftermath of underground prog band Bleeding Oath, who had gained a cult following in the London and eventually UK scene. The rhythm section of Bleeding Oath will now comprise Novena with ex drummer Harrison White on lead guitar and Moat Lowe continuing as bassist in the new band.

3. Long Island-based Novena existed briefly and has music posted on this very site. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Novena">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
