There are two bands "Komandos"

1. Komandos (Heavy Metal)

Long, long time ago two friends: Mateusz Balcerkiewicz and Dominik Wachowski decided to form up a band.

However, as a date of establishment we consider 31.10.2010, because then took place our first rehearsal with more serious team. After long deliberations, we've chosen to play under the name Komandos - as a tribute to cheap wine called so - and so it remains till today. Our gigs are mix of kick of heavy music right in the chest and great show, forcing listener to have real fun.
