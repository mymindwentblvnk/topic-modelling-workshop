History:
During summer 2006, 5 friends, after several musical experience, decide to form a group. Influenced by the great names of Metal (Children Of Bodom, Tagada Jones, Black Bomb A, The ARRS, Metallica, In Flames, Betzefer, Trivium, Bleeding Through, Blind Stare, Dark Tranquility, Lamb Of God, Threat Signal...) the group starts to compose a style of music joining melody sonorities and heavy dynamics, accompanied by committed French words. The repetitions begin to prepare a first playlist which will be born at the beginning of 2008. After some concerts inside bars, theaters or festivals of the region, the group taking part in a springboard organized by the town of Saint-Quentin on the occasion of the annual music festival which takes place in the streets in June 2008 and wins the first price: a session of recording studio. In the end of the year 2008, the group begins the recording of their first EP in the "Kozak studio" in Gauchy (the mastering is made by the "Red Studio" of Douai). The group releases officially his first EP in 500 copy during the festival “En Trans' Aisne 2” in February 2009 with an aim of making known themselves and to contact several festivals. Currently, the group composes new songs which will form the future album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Spellbinding">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
