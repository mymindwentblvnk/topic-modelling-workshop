There are multiple artists called Gala.

1. Gala (born Gala Rizzatto, 6 September 1975) is an Italian pop singer and songwriter. Her debut album Come into My Life included the multiplatinum singles Freed from Desire, Let a Boy Cry and Come into My Life which reached the Top 3 in music charts across Europe, South America, Russia and the Middle East. Gala has sold over six million records worldwide.

2. Gala is a little-known project that hails from Mexico, to date releasing one album called Gregorian Dance (published in 1994 by Polygram). Featuring seven original songs, the album is a mixture of sampled Gregorian chants mixed with dance beats and ambient instruments. All tracks are composed by Fontana and feature a variety of jazzy and dance instruments as well as some French singing and Enigma-like breathing, despite lower production values. Cosmos, is an eerie song featuring a brief, cropped sample of a Gregorian prayer as well as female chanting and some flamenco guitar flourishes. It often comes across as a pale Enigma clone: many songs feature chirpy, affected samples which are repeated and occasionally even sound out of place with the backing instrumentation. The overall sound might be considered slightly out-of-date by today's standards. Also included on the album are 5 remixes of some of the main songs, which are mostly radio versions.

3. Gala (Vesna Galiot) is Serbian dance pop artist

4. Gala is a Chinese band.

5. Gala is a Latin ethnic fusion project consisting of Alex Soler, Juan Tarodo and Sergio Soler. They were inspired by the success of Gregorian chants combined with dance beats, mainly trance and house. Produced and arranged by Jorge √Ålvarez, "Gregorian Dance" was released by Polygram in June 1994, issuing the single "Graduate" a year later...
