Black Flame is an Italian black metal band formed in 1998.

Black Flame was formed by Cardinale Italo Martire, Serpentrax and m:A Fog in 1998 - the same line-up that exists today. They started as a cold and raw black metal act, strongly influenced by the occult both musically and lyrically. They released their first two demos in 2001 and 2002, followed by several live performances. A 7" EP was released in 2002, and their first full-length album, The Third Revelation, came out in 2003.
