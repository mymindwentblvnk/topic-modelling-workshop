Fronted by Tommy DeCarlo (who has been performing with the legendary classic rock band Boston since 2007) and co-founder Tommy DeCarlo Jr., DeCarlo is more than just an amazing live band. The band has finally completed their debut album offering a very fine slice of melodic rock deeply rooted in the sound of rock masters like Boston, Foreigner, Survivor and REO Speedwagon.
The band originated in Charlotte, North Carolina and sees Tommy DeCarlo collaborate with his son Tommy Jr. along with drummer Dan Hitz and bassist Brett Nelson. The band has toured in many US states and has recently made its live debut at the Frontiers Rock Festival in Milan, Italy where they have taken by storm the fans who participated at the kick off acoustic night.
Simply put… DeCarlo rocks and if you are a classic AOR/MR follower, you just can’t miss this!
