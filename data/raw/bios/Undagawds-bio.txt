Undagawds – consisting of rapper Peter Manns & beatmaker Thelonious Coltrane – an American/Russian MC and Producer team with their chosen home Frankfurt am Main (Germany).
Peter Manns came from Cambridge (Massachusetts) to the German banking capital . There he met Thelonious Coltrane, who was about to flood the market across the city limits with a myriad of beat tapes long ago. It clicked between those two directly and, as a result, they created an absolute new school boombap-masterpiece.

The beats from Coltrane vary from soulful grooves und jazz samples (“Looking for Words“ and “Cognac“) to classic headnod-bangers („jump up“). Peter Manns adds his thoughtful lyrics being permanently performed with an unlimited amount of coolness to a perfect mix.

"Devil on my back, but i stay on track"

Friends left behind and newly won in the old and new home, phases of childhood and youth or simply the life itself – Peter Manns drags the listener into the hustle coming along with being a young immigrant from America trying to find his way in a foreign country and city. Of course, there are the girls, the funk, the partys and the weed as well... but foremost, each song those two present delivers the message: despite all difficulties and irregularities, it is the music, which makes it all void and, ultimately, puts together all the scattered pieces!

"We made a classic!" – and would they say otherwise, it would not be Hip Hop! Selftitled.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Undagawds">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
