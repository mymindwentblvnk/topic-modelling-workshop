Swedish melodic death metal band formed in 1991. They released their first demo The Time Of Autumn in 1993. They subsequently recorded their first EP As Tears in Unisound studios in November 1994 which was released by Chaos records in 1995. They then signed to No Fashion records and recorded their debut full length album in Abyss studios Silence Of The World Beyond, released in 1996. Their second album The Only Pure Hate was recorded at Sunlight studios in 1997 and released in 1998. Two songs which had been intended for release on Silence OfThe World Beyond were re-recorded and released by Temple Of Darkness records as  Reflections of the Mirror on 7" vinyl in 2012. A double CD compilation called  Quintessence consisting of their debut and sophomore full lengths, a song from the Reflections Of The Mirror EP, 2 exclusive unreleased re-recorded tracks, a live track from 2010, two tracks from the Land of The Lost unreleased demo from 1997,  and the entire As Tears EP from 1995 was released by Cyclone Empire in 2013.

In 2011, vinyl re-release label The Crypt records remastered and pressed their demo and EP on 12", limited to 500 copies total - 250 on magenta and 250 black, as As Tears / The Time Of Autumn with a huge poster of the As Tears cover art and updated liner notes.
In 2013 they remastered and pressed Silence Of The World Beyond on 12", again with huge poster of the cover art, updated liner notes, and limited to 500 copies total - 250 on pink (they call it red)/purple splatter/marble mix and 250 black. These releases did not have vinyl editions until The Crypt stepped in. 
As of May 2014, both reissues are still available in both colored and black vinyl. The Crypt will release The Only Pure Hate and The Land Of The Lost 1996 Unreleased Demo on vinyl in the future.

Guitarist(1994-1999) Leo Pignon later formed a black metal band called NIDEN DIV. 187 with members of DAWN and THY PRIMORDIAL and were signed to Necropolis records. Drummer (and initially guitarist) Fredrik Andersson played drums along with A Canorous Quintet guitarist Linus Nirbrant (on guitar) and bassist Jesper LÃ¶fgren (on bass) in Guidance Of Sin and after Fredrik left Guidance Of Sin in 1999, he has been drummer for Amon Amarth. Vocalist Marten Hansen performed vocals on another Swedish melodic death metal album, Sins Of Omission's Flesh On Your Bones released in 2001.

A Canorous Quintet reunited as This Ending in 2005, initially calling themselves The Plague on their demo, but changed to This Ending for their studio releases. As This Ending, they've released two full lengths on Metal Blade records and a self-released EP. It's rumored the band may release new material as A Canorous Quintet, not This Ending, in the near future. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/A+Canorous+Quintet">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
