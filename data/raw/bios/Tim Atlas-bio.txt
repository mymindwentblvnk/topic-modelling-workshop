The Oakland-born now Los Angeles-based, Tim Atlas, known for his unique brand of downtempo R&B and Neo-soul akin to the sounds of Toro y Moi, Unknown Mortal Orchestra and Rex Orange County initially made waves with his 2018 EP, All Talk! From there, Atlas went on to pick-up significant support among radio tastemakers including Zane Lowe on Beats 1, Arielle Free Radio One and publications such as Paste, Complex, Clash, EARMIK, Line of Best Fit, OnestoWatch and many more. After amassing over 40 million streams and love from Spotify, Apple Music, and more, Atlas embarked on a global tour marking key shows in London, New York and Los Angeles, supporting The Magic City Hippies and Gold Room, debuting his first festival appearances at The Great Escape Festival in UK and Noise Pop in San Francisco. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tim+Atlas">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
