This quartet of once cryogenically frozen dino-slayers have been destroying lives for the past four years, ever since they were shipped to Miami via military attack aircraft. Austin and Emmett, once defrosted, began playing in early 2004 in what would eventually become The Panix. After skullfucking and tearing the faces off of three drummers, the remaining members of The Panix rescued Wolfgang from the clutches of an evil-doing butt-fondeler by the name of Zed. Once Wolfgang's therapy sessions had erased the memory of his enslavement to his butt-fondling master, The Panix were back in business. In need of more eardrum blowing guitar shredding, The Panix recruited a strapping young lad by the name of Alex Nunez. Alex, much like his soon to be drummer, was once enslaved by a power hungry, cock-rock monster. Alex freed himself once he discovered his power to make panties melt and the rest is history. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Panix">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
