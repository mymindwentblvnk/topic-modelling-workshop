A GOOD DAY FOR KILLING rose up from the bloody pit of Thailand about the mid of year 2002 with the exact aim that was to play brutal musick as fast and sick as they could. 
In February next year they entered the local rehearsal room to record their debut rehearsal demo titled “AssAsSin”, 
and it was finally unleashed in March 2003. 
This demo was spread to severely attacked the underground scenes worldwide over 300 copies.

Since the beginning of the band, they had been searching for a fitting bassist for their band. 
After audition some stupid trendy guys they found Norathep in May 2004 who was a skillful bass player and had same brutal attitude with them. 
So he was recruited to the band then, and now the line-up was first time complete. 
With this line-up they did the first official live performance at the gig called ‘Blasphemic Warfare’ and recorded 3 new songs for the 4 way split CD called 'Siamese Brutalism Assault!!' which included the most brutal bands from Thailand like Lacerate, Deathguy, She's Gore and AGDFK. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/A+Good+Day+For+Killing">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
