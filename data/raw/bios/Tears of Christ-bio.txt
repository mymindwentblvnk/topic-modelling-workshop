There were two bands called Tears Of Christ, both split up.

1) The first Tears Of Christ was an Italian black metal band formed in 1994, a side project of Mauro Pirino (vocals) and Chris Scarponi (guitars & bass) from Calvary, an atmospheric death metal band. The line-up was completed with two session members Alex Arosio (drums) and Adrian (keyboards).

Their first release was a split demo with Buzrael, another Italian black metal project, in 1994. Tears Of Christ's side was two tracks and an interlude and the split tape was released by Dawn Of Sadness Productions. The second - and last - release was "Within My Forgotten Woods Of Mystery" 7"EP, recorded in the late 1995 and released by the underground Italian label Maggot Records in 1996. Soon afterwards Mauro & Chris decided to quit the project.

2) The more recent Tears of Christ was a hungarian death metal band. They worked between early 2005 and summer of 2007. The first line-up is: Gál Dávid-vocal; Daradics Levente-guitar; Zoványi Ferenc-bass guitar; Mohácsi Zsolt-drums.
In the summer of 2006 they recorded a demo with 6 tracks.
In the early 2007 changed line-up, Bass guitarist out, so Szabados Krisztián-guitar and Bodnár Csaba-Bass guitar&vocal.
At the same time they recorded a disc called Vissza a pokola (straight to hell), but it's never published.
At the summer of 2007 they stop work together. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tears+of+Christ">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
