James is a singer-songwriter that trends toward the Indie pop and R&B style. He tends to release music that is more minimal in terms of production so that his voice is the focal point of each track.
He was born in Baltimore, Ohio where he grew up raising and showing llamas at the county fair before moving to Cincinnati and joining his first band. After a few years with the band they ended things and James began pushing forward into a solo career. Due to a lack of growth and exposure in Cincy, James moved to Nashville in 2015 where he has since released several tracks with moderate success locally and internationally. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/James+Droll">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
