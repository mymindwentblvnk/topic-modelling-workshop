Started in January 2010, in the Southern California region. Determined to create the heaviest and most unforgetable music, Influenced by technical, Brutal death metal, Resurrecting Judas creates its own style of unique heaviness! Resurrecting Judas is a very serious and active project. After releasing their first E.P. in October 2010 entitled, "Vast Realms of Chaos Incarnate" on Sevared Records, Resurrecting Judas is on their way to writing a full length masterpiece. The writing process is under way. The attitude is very professional and patient while writing for the new release and coming along very well! First full length release should be expected by late 2011- Early 2012.
