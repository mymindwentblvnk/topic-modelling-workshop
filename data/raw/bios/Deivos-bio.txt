Deivos was formed in 1997 in Lublin, Poland by guitarists Tomasz Kolcon, Maciej Nawrocki and vocalist Marcin Gorniak. In 1999 the band recorded their first demo Praised By Generations on which a drum machine was used. As there was no full line-up, it was impossible to play gigs.

In the middle of 2000 Deivos were strengthened by two new members: drummer Krzysztof Saran (from Abusiveness) and a bassist Jarek Pienkos. In 2001 the band started to work on new material for the next release. In the end of that year M. Nawrocki and M. Gorniak left Deivos, so the group remained with one guitarist and Jarek took over the vocals in addition to his bass playing.

In the beginning of 2003 a mini cd named Hostile Blood was recorded, thanks to which Deivos gained much acclaim in the metal underground. The label Butchery Music released this mcd in autumn 2003.

In 2004 guitarist Mscislaw from Abusiveness completed the bands line-up. Then, Deivos began to write new stuff for their first full length album, which was ultimately recorded in Jan/Feb 2006 at renowned Hertz Studio. The album named Emanation From Below was released in Poland by Empire Records in November 2006 and received some great reviews.
In 2008, Poland's Metal Mind re-released Emanation From Below in Poland and more importantly in Europe and the USA, which made it available internationally.

In September/October 2008, the band entered Hertz Studio to record their second album titled Gospel of Maggots.
In 2009 Deivos signed with Unique Leader Records. The label set a release date of February 2010 for Gospel of Maggots which was released that year. Later on in 2011 they released their second album with Unique Leader Demiurge of The Void
