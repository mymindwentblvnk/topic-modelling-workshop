Miasis was born in mid to late 1999 in a suburb just outside of Chicago. Within weeks they had written their first song (sans vocals) during a spur of the moment practice session. And within a couple of months they had recorded a 3 song demo of all instrumental material. After a little consideration and one small attic show, Miasis decided that no vocalist was needed and the band would continue on as a trio.

In November of 1999, however, the members decided to contact Sean Ingram of Coalesce fame to record guest vocals on their demo. To their surprise, he took on the project. After various communication and several recordings between 2000 and 2001, as well as the final mastering in 2002, Miasis released a 3-song EP titled "In And Out of Weeks" on now-defunct Undecided Records. 

On the EP, none of the tracks were titled, and the album booklet does not contain any lyrics, which causes the listener to focus on Sean's scream as another instrument. The music is a discordant, down-tuned, mid-tempo brand of hardcore. Many comparisons have been drawn between Miasis and Coalesce (especially because of Ingram's distinct bellow), but Miasis does differentiate their sound from the former with use of acoustic guitar and emphasis on almost free-running bass, especially in "002".

Because of no known activity since the release of "In And Out of Weeks", Miasis seems to be a one-time musical collaboration. The line-up on the EP was Andy Chavez (bass guitar), Joe Chavez (acoustic guitar, drums), Evan Mallon (guitar), and Sean Ingram (vocals). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Miasis">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
