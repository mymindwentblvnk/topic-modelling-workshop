In 2004, Canadian metal band Darkness Rites was formed from the ashes of several local bands. With the intention of writing a balanced blend of death, thrash, and classic balls-to-the-wall metal Darkness Rites got down to business immediately putting together a setlist that complimented their wildly energetic live performance. 

With over 170 shows under their belt, combined with extensive tours across Canada for the last 4 and a half years, the band has secured their spot as one of Canada’s promising metal acts. Touring extensively in support of their demo (2005) and their self titled full length (2006, Big Metal Records) the band has been blessed to tour alongside Thine Eyes Bleed and Blind Witness, as well as playing with acts such as The Black Dahlia Murder, The Red Chord, The End, Beneath the Massacre, Despised Icon, Quo Vadis, Dead to Fall and Suicide Silence to name a few. 

Darkness Rites is working hard to bring their act to the rest of the world after an onslaught of setbacks, member changes and hardships over the past few years.

Darkness Rites is currently recording their second full length album “The Accuser” which is set to be released within the next year. After almost three full years of writing the band is finally back in the studio. The band has chosen to work with Producer/Engineer Chris Donaldson of Cryptopsy fame, who has previously worked with The Agonist (Century Media), Endast (Big Metal Records) and many others. Loyal fans and new fans alike should be excited for this release as it is the heaviest and most technical material the band has written to date.

So keep your eyes and ears open in 2009, Darkness Rites is here take over the metal world. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Darkness+Rites">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
