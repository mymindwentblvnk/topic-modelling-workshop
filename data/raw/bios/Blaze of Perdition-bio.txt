Blaze of a Perdition are a black metal band from Lublin, Poland, formerly known as Perdition. The band was founded by XCIII (also known as Aiwass) and was a follow-up to a schism within Perdition as different visions of the band's founders made a kind of breakthrough. Thus Xaos Oblivion left and Ashgan (Septic Seraph) and Sonneillon (aka D. of Ulcer) joined the Order. The idea of using two vocalists turned out to be a success thus Blaze of Perdition was created. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Blaze+of+Perdition">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
