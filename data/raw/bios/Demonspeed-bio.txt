Demonspeed are a band that play a unique strain of Sinatra/swing/big band infused thrash metal. The band was formed in 1994, and released an EP in 1997 titled 'Swing is Hell', as well as an album in 2003 titled 'Kill kill kill'.

That suave cocktail of riffola and swing. Like getting smacked upside the head with a broken martini glass. Dig? Maybe you've seen it live as these jumpin' New York cats have torn through club after club: suits n' swing, tatoos n' the beautiful babies. Add in some nasty chugging guitars for the dudes fighting in the parking lot and you're there.

The tale is often told and doesn't need to be heard again. John Wayne Gacey got the juice in the Windy City a couple of years back and Demonspeed was born almost simultaneously. Listen to the opening number, "Pogo", for details. Since then they've brought a distinct sense of class to shows with the likes of Bad Religion, Social Distortion, CIV, the Lunachicks, and the Business. From juke joint to speak easy--(and you've probably heard the hit "Green River" being played in a few of the finer ones on the Lower East Side)--Demonspeed is the Rotten Apple's most talked about new band.

Frontman Matt Payne treads the boards like the twisted reincarnation of Robert Mitchum; crooning over the heavy, heavy groove. Bassist Sal Villanueva and drummer Jim "The Swing" King give it a churning bottom. All whilst guitarist Chris Shannon crunched like a stalker in the leaves. It's bachelor pad music in the Jeffrey Dahmer vein if you catch my drift, daddy-o.

"Some pundits have called the group an unlikely cross between Slayer and Glenn Miller, while others haggested that a more appropriate description would be a marriage between Glenn Danzig and Brian Setzer's Big Band." -Billboard Magazine <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Demonspeed">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
