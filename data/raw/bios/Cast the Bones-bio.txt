Cast The Bones are a Death Metal band from Brighton started in late 2006 by Gary 'Shoutface' Wareham and Charlie Robertson under the name Inevitable Destruction.  One track, also called Inevitable Destruction, was recorded and posted on Myspace.  

Some time after this Gary and Charlie recruited a full band, consisting of Tim Needham on bass, Ben Tinson on lead guitar and Tim 'Big Guns' Newman on drums.  This lineup continued to write more tunes, including Your Demise and Drip Fed Orphan Farm.  

However, this lineup did not work out well for the band and Charlie was let go and replaced with Ian 'Monty' Montgomery on rhythm guitar.  The band continued to write new tracks including Crown of Severed Limbs, Melt the Ignorant, Eternal Blight and a reworking of Drip Fed Orphan Farm.  This lineup played 3 shows, one at the Engine Rooms in Brighton (without Monty), one supporting Hatebreed at the Concorde 2 and another at the Pressure Point.  Shortly after these shows, Monty was also let go and replaced by Richard 'The Metal Hairdresser' Langridge.  

A while after this Ben moved out of town and both Tims went travelling.  However, this was not the end for the band and they are back in 2008 with a new lineup to relaunch their debut EP Rancour. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cast+The+Bones">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
