Helpless have blindsided us. With Plymouth not previously standing as much of a hotbed of forward-thinking dissonant, discordant, inventive punk/metal/sludge, Helpless stand alone.

Containing a former member of the much underrated Brotherhood of the Lake (albeit one whom has moved from guitar to drums), this fact acts as somewhat of a guiding black light of the sound contained herein.

If the noisier and more technical end of those old Hydrahead, Robotic Empire and Blackmarket Activities catalogues float your boat then rejoice that the UK now has bands like Helpless to spit back across the pond at such luminariesâ€¦.
