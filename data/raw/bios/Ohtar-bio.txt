Ohtar are a Polish black metal band from Świdnica, Dolnośląskie. Formed in 1996, the band began their debut by releasing the first demo in 1997. Their lyrical themes are recently well-known to have depressive, melancholic, pessimistic, misanthropic, desolate, and suicidal overtones. The band originally split-up in early 2012 and formed a new project called "Boundlessness". Reformed in 2014.
Most of the time, Ohtar share similar lineup with Selbstmord, consisting of Necro and Diathyrron.
The band's name is allegedly referring to "Ohtar", a fictional character created by the writer J.R.R. Tolkien in the mythology of Middle-earth - the esquire of Isildur in the early Third Age.

Ohtar have participated on several split albums with fellow Polish bands such as Dark Fury and Moontower.
