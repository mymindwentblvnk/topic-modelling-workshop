2) An Austrian band formed in 2010, the band states to be influenced by Norwegian Black Metal but has imprinted it with their own style, which they label AlpineBlackMetal. This is apparent in their lyrics, all written in German, which talk about Alpine mysticism and heathen legends. RAUHNACHT is the name of the twelve nights between December 24th and January 6th, when the demons of winter and the Perchten celebrate their Wild Hunt through hidden alpine villages and forests. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rauhnacht">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
