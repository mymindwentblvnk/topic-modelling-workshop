Started by Shu, Iksrog and Abaddon in 2005 in Bourgas, Bulgaria. After completing three songs for a demo, the project went on hold for a few years. Around 2007 Iksrog continued the idea of Forest Troll with his friend Naazakh. They recorded two more songs, with Atmospheric Black influence, but again all went on hold for some time. Between 2011 and 2012, Iksrog and Naazakh decided to bring new life in this project and made several tries for recording, but after a few obstacles occured, Forest Troll was again put to sleep. 

The album "Forgotten Tales" can be downloaded for free at http://foresttroll.bandcamp.com/

Currently working on new material and a video to a new song.
The new album "Hex", will be released 06.06.2015 by Werewolf Promotions.
