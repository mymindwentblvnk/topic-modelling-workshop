Man Of Sorrows arose in '05 & is based out of San Antonio Texas. M.O.S.'s sound is very heavy & unique. Utilizing all styles of metal/metalcore & is ever evolving in it's aproach to song writing. M.O.S. separates itself from the "breakdown only" bands by writing real songs w/ real progressions. Songs that go deep w/ substance, intelligence, conviction. Most of all, M.O.S. has drawn an even deeper line of separation not only by thier sound but by their message. M.O.S. is a Christian force to be reckoned with & has been very well accepted by the metal/metalcore masses. M.O.S.'s self titled debut CD, released by (Paloma Sound) which is now (TAKE IT BY FORCE RECORDS). The CD received great reviews by many music critics & online magazines. M.O.S. was also featured & interviewed in Hails & Horns Metal Magazine which sold @ Hot Topics across the U.S. & Canada. Here, the band received great acclaim for the their first effort. This created a growing momemtum which helped catapult M.O.S. from local to regional to national & eventually international. M.O.S. has toured for the past two years in the furthest parts of Oaxaca Mexico & has an ever growing fan base there & in South American Regions. M.O.S.'s first U.S. & Mexico tours brought them together w/ such bands as (Face Down Records) For Today & Wrench In The Works, The Great Commission (Earth Harvest Records) Saving Grace, (wounded Records) Bringing Down Broadway, Sovereign Strength & others. Man Of Sorrows is @ this moment in the process of reinventing themselves musicaly & spiritually. Preparations for the second release & touring plans for next year are now under way. For their second coming, Man Of Sorrows promises nothing less than to pour out their hearts, souls, blood, sweat & tears to bring you a colossal array of chaotic serenity to quench the "Blood" thirsty masses & bring edification to the depraved & satisfaction to the discontent. By all that I mean, It's gonna rock! Spread The word! M.O.S. is on the rise once again... 
THIS IS WHAT WE BELIEVE Man Of Sorrows as I before mentioned is a Christian band. We are called & commissioned by our faith in Jesus Christ by our music to bring the world a message of Love, peace & a great sacrifice. This brutal sacrifice of Gods only son Jesus Christ can & will bring eternal life in heaven & blessings of a life with purpose, meaning & fulfilment. To those who choose to believe in Him, this a promise given by A loving God that knew you before you were born & before the foundations of the earth, Loved you then & now. This is why we're here & this is where we stand...
