1) Vanaheim was a black / viking metal band from Bærum, Norway that was formed in the summer of 1995. They released one album and one EP one under their own label. When their drummer was fired Athera was asked to join them as a session drummer since he had been playing drums as a hobby for some years (he usually takes care of the vocals). They played together for several years without no real success and the band was finally laid to rest in 1999 when several members joined the upcoming band Susperia. Memnock and Athera had played together for a long time in several local bands.

5) Vanaheim, Pagan/folk metal from Dutch ground. Raging primal violence alternates with danceable, heavy and uplifting melodies. The energetic mix between epic pagan metal and the typical, catchy folk metal creeps deep under your skin, and makes you want to move whether you want it or not! With their EP "The House Spirit" they have performed on many stages already. With their reasonably short existence, they have had the honour to share stages with a number of giants within the folk metal scene. Performances with Heidevolk, Finsterforst and Equilibrium are achievements that the men of Vanaheim are very proud of!
