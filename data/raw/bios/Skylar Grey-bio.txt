Grey is perhaps best known as a guest vocalist on several hit singles, including Fort Minor's "Where'd You Go", P.

In 2003, Grey moved to Los Angeles and recorded a demo under the alias Holly Brook, which would be her stage name for several years.This demo led to her being signed in the fall of 2004 by Linkin Park guitarist Brad Delson, to the band's vanity label, Machine Shop Recordings, at the age of 18. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Skylar+Grey">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
