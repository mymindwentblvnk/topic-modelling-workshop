The Mutilator mixes the various strands of death-metal in their music. Collecting together hard riffs from brutal/technical death styles, as well as something melodic like a Schuldiner's Death, female growl vocals with male, the band shows thier vision of the death metal's world. On stage, they proved thierself as "a cheerful mix of old school death metal and death metal that more modern, more brutal, technical and fast. Growls on vocals, nice and evil riffs with beautiful solos - good portion of extreme music that you should definitely bang your head!"
