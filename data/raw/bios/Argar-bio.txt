Argar is a, now defunct, Black metal band from Barcelona, Spain. Active between 1996 and 2004, they produced 3 albums: The Flame of Dark Creation (1997), Cwm Annwn (2001) and Grim March to Black Eternity (2004). 

The band maintained a Pagan ideology throughout their existence, although their lyrics mostly deal with Death, hatred and negativity. Musically, Argar are often favourably compared to earlier Emperor, playing a highly symphonic style of Black Metal with raw, highly distorted guitars, fast drumming and a mix of rasping and high pitched shrieking vocals. They seldom received any press attention, however they were often praised for their varied songs and highly atmospheric style.

Since disbanding several members have formed the raw Black metal band Spectre and front man Ur Profanum has also begun a solo project called Grim Funeral.
