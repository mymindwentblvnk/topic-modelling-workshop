In 2003 Gordon Pohl(electronics) and Gerhard Michel(guitar, voice) founded: musiccargo. The electronic club experience and advanced sequencer programming skills came together with krautrock roots. That happened in Duesseldorf, a city in which electronic music is always something to keep an eye on: KRAFTWERK, PROPAGANDA, NEU!, LA DÜSSELDORF are acts from Düsseldorf that builded their own new urban "Zeitgeist". While the dj has been touring Europe, the guitarist played together with Klaus Dinger, founder of Neu!, La Düsseldorf and drummer on the first Kraftwerk Album. These hand-made krautrock experiences combined with the machine-made computer elements are leading both protagonists to their style. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Musiccargo">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
