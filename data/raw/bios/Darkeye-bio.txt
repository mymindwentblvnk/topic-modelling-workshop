Darkeye is a 4 piece metal band from London UK.

After the break up on technical metal band VIOLATION COMPLEX, Guitarist Dean Hanfrey and drummer Frazer Plank decided to form a new project that would continue pushing the progressive rhythms and brutal heaviness of their previous band but also allow the songs to be far more accessible and epic.

Adding Dave WInter on 2nd guitar and Jeff Barber on Bass, the band set about writing material to appear on their 2013 EP.  Since recording, the band have been building a steady portfolio of live performances and positive reviews. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Darkeye">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
