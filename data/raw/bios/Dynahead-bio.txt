In the autumn of 2004 the Brazilian backlands saw the birth of an unique musical conjunction, that only a
land of mixtures would be able to generate. Determined to break barriers, DYNAHEAD goes one step
further with their fourth album, the two-part concept piece Chordata.

The debut Antigen (2009) enraptured fans of heavy music all over the world with their fresh approach,
and the concept album Youniverse (2011) satiated listeners thirsty for new experiences with a deeper and
even more progressive flair. Fluently mixing elements ranging from Extreme Metal to Jazz, DYNAHEAD
breaks conventions by putting together exquisite technique, taste and aggression without falling into
mere exaggeration or clich√©.

Known for producing all of its own material, the band stays proudly away from commercial pressures or
passing trends. By valuing aesthetical richness and musical dynamics, the band collected an outstanding
reputation with critics, rare even among signed bands.

Chordata is a two part concept album, a metaphorical tale based on the biological evolution of life and
society. A collection of songs more mature, musical and bold than ever, Chordata showcases an unique band, ready to challenge your ears and take them to unexplored territories in alternative music.
