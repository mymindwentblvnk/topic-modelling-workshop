Kandi Burruss entered professional music in 1992 as a singer in the successful vocal group Xscape. She sang lead on their hits "Just Kickin' It" and "My Little Secret", displaying a versatile contralto voice flexible enough to sing above soprano range. Burruss also wrote some of Xscape's early hits, including "Feels So Good" and "Can't Hang". When the group disbanded in 1999, Burruss continued as a songwriter and soloist. She has been credited with the discovery of Columbia recording artists Jagged Edge.

In 2000, Burruss's song "No Scrubs", performed by TLC, won the Grammy Award for Best R&B Song. She also made history in 2000 as the first woman ever to win the ASCAP "Rhythm & Soul Songwriter of the Year" award. She has continued to write for a number of pop and R&B artists, including significant contributions to Destiny's Child's "The Writing's on the Wall" (including "Bills, Bills, Bills" and "Bug-a-Boo") which sold 13 million copies.[citation needed] Burruss has written for *NSYNC, Mariah Carey, Boyz II Men, Faith Evans, Whitney Houston, Pink, and Alicia Keys. Producer Kevin "Shekspere" Briggs has been an important long-term collaborator.

Her debut album, Hey Kandi... peaked at #72 on the Billboard Hot 200 and sold reasonably well in its first few months on the chart.
