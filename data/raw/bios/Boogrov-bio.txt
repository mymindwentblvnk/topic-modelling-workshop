Andrey Boogrov is young electronic producer and musician from Moscow. Giving a preference to various shapes of Disco and Soul, he's skillfully balancing on the edge between current trends and retro sound stylizations. Boogrov doesn't put himself into the rigid frames of genres. Pop music and electronic experiments attract him equally. 

In March of 2015 Boogrov presented his debut EP called 'Ostium'. 
Work on the EP lasted for almost half a year. It includes four brand new songs. Three of them are collaborations with New Yourk-based vocalist Ayer, Ukrainian singer Aluna as well as with the best young Russian Pop-band Mana Island. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Boogrov">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
