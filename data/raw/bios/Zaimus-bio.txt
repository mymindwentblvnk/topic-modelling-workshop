Zaimus was formed in 2003, although didn't start with work immediately . Till year 2005 they had performed two gigs, recorded two unreleased songs and undergone minor changes in the band. From 2005 to 2006 band was stagnating, but in the winter of 2006 was recharged with new blackened power and ideas, reborn like two-warlord band which consists of Khamul (vocals, bass, programming) and Asmodai (guitars), who are also original founders of Zaimus.

In September 2007, the recording session for the first demo was finished. Three songs, one of which is cover, were recorded in different times between 2006 and 2007. This material, simply called "Demo 2007", was released few months later.

In late August 2008, band started recording its first EP entitled “The Unholy Spells Of Night”. The recording of Asmodai's guitars was finished in early September of the same year. The recording of vocals and bass, programming, together with production and mixing part, were done by Khamul, during the first half of 2009. EP was released in the October 2009 and contains 4 new authorial songs - 24 minutes of total playing time.

All songs were recorded, produced and mixed by Khamul at his home-studio “Rebellion”.
