Darien Dash (born July 21, 1992), better known by his stage name, Dash (stylized as Da$H) is an American rapper from Hackensack, New Jersey and is a member of H'z Global along with friend and long time collaborator RetcH, hence the capitalized H in their names. Unlike other members of the A$AP Mob, Da$H does not put the "A$AP" moniker before his name. 

He is also the nephew of Jay-Z's former manager Damon Dash. Da$H started rapping around the age of sixteen and uploaded music on MySpace with his friends for fun. He then decided he wanted to take rapping seriously and joined the A$AP Mob. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Da$H">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
