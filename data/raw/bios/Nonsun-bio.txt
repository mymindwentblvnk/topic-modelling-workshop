"The opposing inertial forces of hunched, creeping motion and rhythm-less feedback stasis provide an intriguing source of unexpected and understated dynamism". (Decibel) 

"Drone-metal seance soaked with innovative stylistic marriages. You won't know how to feel...". (Heavy Planet) 

"Headiness and dissonance of the years 2000 along with crushingness and sorrowful, aesthetic darkness of the early 90's...". (Temple of Perdition)
