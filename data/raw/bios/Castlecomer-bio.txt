Forming in late 2010, Castlecomer released their debut EP "Danny's Den" on the 30th of March 2012 at one of Sydney's premier live music venues, The Gaelic Theatre in Surry Hills. Laying their claim as the last live act ever to grace the stage at the venue, they released their "Danny's Den" EP to a sell-out crowd of 600, and have continued to advance in leaps and bounds, thrilling audiences with their live performances in Sydney and down the east coast of Australia. 

Castlecomer boast a high-impact live show with their 5-part harmonies, and have shared the stage with such acts as Ball Park Music, Faker, Winter People, Underlights and Mitzi among others, and have been involved in established events such as Secret Garden Festival, Communion, Major Raiser, Macquarie University Conception Day and UNSW Open Day.
