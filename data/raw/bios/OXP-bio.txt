OXP is the collaborative project between producers Onra and Pomrad. United by their love for hip-hop, R&B, jazz and funk, the two artists set off to start a project that would combine Onra’s production skills with Pomrad’s composition talent. The result is OXP (that's "Onra x Pomrad").

Onra is a music producer from France, known for his soulful hip-hop beats. Since his debut in 2006, Onra has been steadily coming out with records after records, including his much-acclaimed Chinoiseries trilogy that sees him incorporate samples of traditional Chinese songs to his mixes (Onra is part-Asian) and his last studio album Nobody Has to Know (2018). It was this record that first brought him to a composer and multi-instrumentalist from Belgium, Pomrad. After collaborating in the track “No Question”, the two seemed to hit it off really well, and they officially teamed up to release their first album together. 

Despite already having two cooks in the kitchen, OXP still makes room for more people in their collaborative project, enlisting the help of a wide variety of vocalists and MCs to take part in their full-length album. They include Devin Morrison, Horace Brown, Reggie B, Grand Puba, Pudgee Tha Phat Bastard, Maiya Blaney, K-Reen and more.

The record is led by single “Swish” featuring Devin Morrison, which was already out on May 15, ahead of the album’s premiere on May 29. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/OXP">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
