There are 2 bands with the name Illumination:

1) Illumination from Norway (electronic)
2) Illumination from Belgium (Thrash metal)

1)
Illumination consists of the english/norwegian artists Nicholas Sillitoe and Per Martinsen (aka Mental Overdrive).
Both Sillitoe and Martinsen are known as true pioneers and innovators in Norwegian electronic music, club culture and alternative pop music production - paving the way for other electronica/pop artists like Røyksopp.
Illumination are also well known for their exquisite remixes under their "Chilluminati" monicker, notably the essential Café del Mar mixes of Mari Boine (Gula Gula), Bugge Wesseltoft (Existence). Both these remixes, as well as their own post-rave come-up, come-down anthem "Cookie Raver" have all been defining moments of the Café del Mar worldwide releases.
After releasing several 12" singles and e.p´s throughout the 1990´s, their eventual major label debut album came in 2000 "This Is Illumination" - with "The Chilluminati remixes" and follow up "The Poppy Rocks" in 2004.
Nicholas Sillitoe is currently occupied with many film and tv scores, and albums with norwegian singer/songwriter Anne Marie Almedal.
Per Martinsen is currently focusing on his electronica project Mental Overdrive, and productions with the band Frost.
