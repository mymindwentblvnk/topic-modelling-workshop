Formed in 2010 by Daniel Downing, Aloeswood is an eclectic mix of black metal, shoegaze, post-rock, progressive, neo-folk and ambient soundscapes which takes influence from a wide source of music and bands.

Experimentation and composition led to Aloeswood releasing its debut EP in 2011 for free in the form of ‘Forsaken Landscapes’. The sound of ‘Forsaken Landscapes’ is likened to bands such as Agalloch, Alcest, Enslaved, Primordial, Forefather and Falloch. Aloeswood’s sound continues to evolve, taking in influence from a wider scope of bands and blending them into the already established sound.

2012 saw Aloeswood release the ‘Winter Hymns’ split album and saw the first ever Aloeswood live performance at the Warhorns Festival in York alongside Skyforger, Wolfchant, Old Corpse Road and others.

After such a well received performance at Warhorns Festival, Aloeswood continued as a live band and performed more shows in 2013. These shows included opening for Falloch, and a successful tour with Old Corpse Road on their ‘As Spectres we Tour this Kingdom’ tour.

Aloeswood is also expected to release its debut full length album entitled ‘Seasons in Solitude’ which expands on and reinforces the style cast of ‘Forsaken Landscapes’ and ‘Winter Hymns’.
