The Jet Age was constituted from the ashes of the critically acclaimed hurricane lamps, of which both singer/songwriter/guitarist Eric Tischler and bass player Greg Bennett were members.  After the lamps broke up, Tischler formed the Jet Age with drumming phenom Pete Nuwayser.  The Jet Age made its debut opening for the Wedding Present, and Tischler and Nuwayser drafted Bennett in time to record the band's first album, Breahtless, in 2006.  

The 2008 follow up, the critically acclaimed concept album What Did You Do During the War, Daddy?, was followed by the group's first national tour and more glowing reviews comparing the band to their heroes the Who, Dinosaur Jr., and Swervedriver.  

In 2009, the band released In Love, another critically acclaimed "rock opera," this time about infidelity and once again toured the United States.  In 2010 the Jet Age hit the road again, this time with the Wedding Present; the two bands played dates in the US and the UK, marking the first time the Jet Age had played outside the US.  The 2010 dates saw The Jet Age debuting the first of a series of new songs they'll be recording in 2011.  Tischler swears the new record won't tell a story. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Jet+Age">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
