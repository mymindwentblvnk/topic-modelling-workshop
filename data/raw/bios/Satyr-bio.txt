1. Satyr is a progressive metal band from Atlanta GA. They have made a name for themselves by blending technical proficiency, complex song structures, and dense emotion into one unique and impressive sound. Mixing equal parts post hardcore, math rock, metalcore, and prog, their music is complemented by weighted lyrics containing forward and genuine subject matter as seen through more lighthearted eyes, which creates a sound and message that can be enjoyed by any and all on the rock and metal spectrum. Their second full length “Totem” comes out 7.1.22 via Kill Iconic Records, led by the catchy and groovy lead single “Vector” out right now! Catch them on tour later this year.
