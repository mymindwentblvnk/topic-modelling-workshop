Skarpretter was formed in the autumn of 2004 and consist of Bob the Knife on bass (ex Gorilla Angreb, Broken Hallux, and Intoxicated Bugs) Uncle Addie on vocals (ex Paragraf 119) HÃ¸nze Baby on guitar (ex Headup and All I See) and Daddy O on drums (ex Paragraf 119, Subspecies and Immortal Death). 
We are all from the scene around Ungdomshuset in Copenhagen, which is also where we have the luxury of a practice room. Our friends and allies include the cool hardworking people of Jagtvej 69, drunks, punx (internationally) and some of the nicest criminals you will ever meet. 
Our sworn enemies count Christian fundamentalists that want to make our house into a church, Sierra, Lima, Delta patrols and anyone with their head up their ass, which sadly includes a significant percentage of the Danish population. Fuck you.
