Vulture's Eye was a sort of plunderphonic-project, existing from 1989 to 1992.

There were following members:
Carl Schorb: synthesizers
Kenneth Gray: vocals + percussion
Andreaz Vogel: noises, loops + mixing

Their annoying dada-sound were always the result of brute improvisations, marked by a very high grade of complete non-sense.

No live-performances, one 12" and a bunch of tape-releases are the heritage of these three-and-a-half years.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/vulture%27s+eye">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
