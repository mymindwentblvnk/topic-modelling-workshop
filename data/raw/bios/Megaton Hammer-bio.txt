Taking their name from the heaviest, most destructive weapon in the universe of Nintendo’s famed “The Legend of Zelda” video game series, Megaton Hammer was formed in early 2007 by four guys who were finding themselves sickened by the current state of music. 

After kicking around the underground scene from Toledo, OH to Detroit, MI since the early to mid 90’s, the members of Megaton Hammer have now joined together to create their soul-crushing signature sound of southern-stoner-punk-metal. With the collaborative songwriting efforts of bassist/vocalist Aaron “Winst” Stoddard (Sleaze Queen) and guitarist Rob D’arpini (Rotten 8 Track), the imaginative lyrical narrative of vocalist Steve Franklin (Rotten 8 Track, lb.), and the hard-hitting beats of drummer Al Hasty (Blindsight), Megaton Hammer are creating a following with their self-produced debut EP "Dreamland", and their loud, heavy, and unpredictably energetic live performances.

On 4/20/2010 Megaton Hammer released the follow-up to "Dreamland"; the EP titled "The Year We Make Contact."
