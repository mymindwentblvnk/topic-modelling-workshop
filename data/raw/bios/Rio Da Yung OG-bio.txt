Rio Da Yung OG started making music with RMC Mike as a teenager, recording songs on a karaoke machine for him and his friends to listen to. Rio didn’t take rap seriously until his idol Team Eastside Peezy encouraged him to and proved that rap made money, he said in an interview with No Jumper.

Honestly, when I met Peezy, that was my— he showed me a twenty thousand dollar check, probably the first day I met him. […] He like, “I just made fifty thousand dollars honestly, today.” That made me right there, like, “This shit serious,” you know what I’m saying? ‘Cause from my perspective rap was like, I used to feel like it was just a show, like I used to think, like, “They ain’t really that rich, they not really making that much money.” When Peezy showed me that shit it showed me like, this— then when he told me how much he liked my music, I’m like, “I damn near gotta do it,” 'cause Peezy was somebody that we [looked up to.] Like, Team Eastside was serious to us when we was growing up.

Rio’s music career took off in late 2019 after his hit single “Legendary” was released, amassing millions of streams, solidifying his spot in the Michigan rap scene.
