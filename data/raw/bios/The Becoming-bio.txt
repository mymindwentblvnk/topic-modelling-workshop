There are bands that slave away year after year, song after song, pouring their hearts into their songs, and their gas tanks, as they criss cross the country waiting for someone to care. Then there are bands that suddenly appear, fully formed and ready to remind us why we love rock and roll. As if crafted in another world and delivered to rescue us from our hyphenated-rock-doldrums, The Becoming has landed and it's time for you to remember what gave you chills the first time you heard really great music. A blend of melody, mood and mystique, The Becoming are here and we will all soon realize what good news that is. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Becoming">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
