The Swedish rock band The Hellacopters was formed in Stockholm, Sweden in 1994 as a side project by Nicke Andersson  (a founding member of the Swedish death metal bands Entombed and Death Breath ), with  Dregen (guitar) (who later left the band to concentrate on his other band Backyard Babies), Kenny Håkansson (bass) and Robert Eriksson (drums). Robert  Dahlqvist,"Strings"(lead guitar) met the other members while working in a bar and replaced Dregen in 1999. Also in the band is Anders Lindström(keyboard, tambourine and guitar), better known as Boba. 
Their first single 'Killing Allan' was recorded in Dec. 1994 and released in early 1995 on Nicke's own label Psychout Records. The first incarnation of their 2nd & 3rd singles, '1995' (Freak Scene Records) and 'Now/What Are You' (Planet Of Noise Records) respectively, came out during 1996. The Hellacopters eventually signed up with 'White Jazz Records' for the debut album 'Supershitty to the Max', released in June 1996, for which the band was rewarded with the Swedish Grammy.
In April 2008 The Hellacopters released their last album 'Head Off', which contains cover tracks of bands that had influenced the band over the years. The first single was "In the Sign of the Octopus", originally performed by The Robots.

The Hellacopters disbanded amicably in 2008 so the members could move on to other projects. Eight years later, the band reassembled in 2016, initially for an exclusive performance at Sweden Rock Festival to celebrate the 20 year anniversary of their award-winning debut album Supershitty to the Max!. Robert "Strängen" Dahlqvist, who played guitar for THE HELLACOPTERS for nearly a decade, died in February 2017 at the age of 40.

On December 17, 2021, The Hellacopters announced a new studio album, Eyes Of Oblivion, to be released on April 1, 2022. This will mark the first time the band has released a full-length album of new material since 2008's Head Off, and the first full length album with Dregen since 1997's Payin' the Dues. Andersson described the album as "The Beatles meets Judas Priest, or Lynyrd Skynyrd meets the Ramones, but the best way to describe this album is that it sounds like The Hellacopters today". To promote the release of 'Eyes Of Oblivion' , the band will release a seven inch single of the album's lead single, "Reap a Hurricane", on February 4, 2022. A music video for "Reap a Hurricane" was also released on the same day as the announcement.  On January 17, 2022, the band released the album's title track as its second single.
