1) Legendary Ex-Misfits guitarist Doyle Wolfgang Von Frankenstein has broken new ground with his solo project, "DOYLE". A horror based hardrock/metal band of epic proportions, this quartet consists of two ex-Misfits members. Still grinding out heavy riffs is the hulking monster himself, Doyle, and bashing skins behind the kit is none other than the Abominable Dr.Chud. Alex Story from ‘Cancerslug’, the Wildman of the stage providing vocals filled with misanthropic rage, while still capturing the beauty of the dark side. Solidifying the quartet is Graham (ex-Graves, ex-Let It Burn) on bass, unifying the skull crushing sound that is the machine Doyle himself has put together. DOYLE cranks out music as scary as the Misfits, as doom laden as Black Sabbath, and has the same hard-hitting in your face style of metal as Motörhead or Slayer.

2) Doyle was a French Metalcore/Screamo band, their first EP, Submerge, was issued in June 2007.
They changed their name to Doyle Airence.

3) Doyle is also an Italian Rock Band formed in 2006, their first LP, "Sweating Gold", was issued in early 2009.
