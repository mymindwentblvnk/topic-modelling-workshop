Formed in 2001, Ninety Minute Reflex began as a cybergrind project. With the addition of James Wiseman on drums in 2004 the band began playing shows all over Florida. In 2008 Jeramie Kling (Absence) joined and continued to pummel the central Florida scene. Wtih the addition of bassist Patrick D. the now full lineup expects to release a new album for 2011.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/ninety+minute+reflex">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
