Burning Caskets started as a death metal project that was put together by two former Rotting bandmates,  Korey Arnold (Vocals) & Mike Belfry (Guitar) in 2009.

After releasing a few demo tracks online, the guys decided to formulate the project into a full band. 

The first Burning Caskets album, "To Burn a False Prophet " was released in July 2011.
With a stable lineup, the band is currently working on the follow-up to "To Burn a False Prophet."

As an additional outlet, Korey and Dan formed a second band; Sewer in late 2011/early 2012.  Sewer is 'brutal slam death metal' in the vein of Devourment, Putrid Pile and Gorgasm.
