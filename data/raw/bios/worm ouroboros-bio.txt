Worm Ouroboros is a post-rock band from San Francisco, CA, United States. Members include Lorraine Rath (Amber Asylum, The Gault) on bass and vocals, Jessica Way (Barren Harvest, World Eater) on guitar and vocals, and Aesop Dekker (Ludicra, Agalloch) on drums. As of February 2018, they have released three full-length albums on the Canadian metal label Profound Lore Records.

They set out to create music which explores the lines between fragility and strength, darkness and light, harmony and discord. Drawing inspiration from many places, including metal, doom, folk, and dark ambient genres, Worm Ouroboros creates its own space; a creeping, dark landscape full of murky dreams and emotions.

Where very delicately woven crafted structures counteract with segments of distorted down-tuned heaviness, it is through this interaction of the two opposing styles that help mold the ethereal and flowing atmospheric vibe of Worm Ouroboros where the drifting and floating aura of the trio's debut album creates a unique and special enigmatic presence; one that is ultimately very dark and haunting.
