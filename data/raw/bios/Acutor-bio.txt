Acutor was a thrash metal band originally formed in 1990 in Bogotá, Colombia. Ricardo Márquez who played drums placed an ad at a record store seeking a guitarist and Carlos Montoya responded becoming the lead guitarist, vocalist and music writer. Francy Helena Polo joined on bass and the band started work on their debut and only album Dios ha Muerto. Ricardo Márquez passed away in 1997 before recording but after writing the drums for the entire album and helping write music for half the songs. Moisés Lugo filled in for Ricardo recording the drums and keyboards on the album, Moisés was also responsible for the music of the intro track. Dios ha Muerto was completed and released on the label "Mort Discos" in 1998, subsequently they split-up in 1999. 

Their album was re-released by "Sylphorium Records" in 2010 including new cover artwork and an official video was released for the title track.
