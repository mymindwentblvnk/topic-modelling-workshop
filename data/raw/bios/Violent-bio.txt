There seem to be more then one artist / group with the name Violent.

1. The German electro-band Violent is build around Sven Ehlers "Ses" & Andreas Lindner "Anlin".
The band was founded in 1997 by S.Ehlers. Andreas joined in 1999.

Both musicians are active since the 70's and have played in several Rock and Pop Bands. 
Both developed a love for electronic music and were influenced by Tangerine Dream, Yes, and ELP.

It's hard to put a genre on Violent and the bandmembers do their best to keep it that way. 
Mostly one could describe their music as soundscapes, but they prefer to call it in their own words: ambilent music

More information can be found on their website, where one can find links to their free downloadable albums
