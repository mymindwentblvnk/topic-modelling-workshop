Krosno, Subcarpathia, Poland (2008 - present)

Beheading Machine got started at the beginning of November 2008 in Subcarpathian town of Krosno - South-East of Poland, when band’s average age was 18. It was founded as a Brutal Technical Death Metal act by five members: Marshall (vocals, lyrics), Maki (vocals), Dziubek (guitars), Linda (bass) and Smola (drums) who left the band due to personal reasons in the beginning of year 2010 and have been immediately replaced by new member Ireq, who since than is a new full time drummer.

Beheading Machine’s first record “Stillbirth Civilisation” EP was recorded, mixed and mastered at the beginning of 2009 in Screw Factory Studio by Yanek Bryt (Suffocation, Destruction, Behemoth, Blindead & more) and soon after all of the 5 songs from this album were posted on band's official profile on MySpace.com and here on Last.fm for free review. In May 09’ “Stillbirth Civilisation” EP was self-released in strictly limited edition of 100 copies. It has been sold out shortly and was greeted with great enthusiasm by the listeners.

The band played many gigs throughout the year, in and outside of Poland playing with such bands as Vader, The Damnation, Dead Infection, Virgin Snatch, Corruption, Whorehouse and many more. 

In the autumn of 2009 the band once again entered the Screw Factory Studio to record it’s first LP with Yanek Bryt. After six months from the first visit in the studio, the record was done. During the recording process Beheading Machine has signed a record deal with Ukrainian record label Eclectic Productions, to re-release their debut EP "Stillbirth Civilisation".

On May 9th 2010 "Stillbirth Civilisation" was re-released. 

The band is currently looking for a record label for it’s new album called "Narcobiological Upgrade".
