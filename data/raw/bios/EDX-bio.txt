Enormous Diverse Xample (of a genius) might not be an accurate, but for sure a possible interpretation of the three letters EDX. Productive and successful for more then a decade, Italian native artist, producer, DJ and multi-talent EDX, has been and still is a well-known name in the dance scene in and outside of his home base Switzerland. First time appearing in 1994 in the local dance scene with various mix tapes for the famous Swiss club “Tarot”, EDX climbed up the ladder of recognition, teaming up with Leon Klein and creating their back-to-back DJ project, as well as their own record label Club Control UK. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/EDX">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
