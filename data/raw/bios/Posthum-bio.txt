Posthum (founded 2004) is in no way a band that hide themselves in a scene, nor a constellation of members you will see in other bands. They`ve carefully created their own unique sound and way of thinking as an isolated band, located in the forests north of Oslo. Their self-titled debut record is highly acclaimed as a hard, but yet atmospheric and beautiful album, with a cold sound and strong arrangements constantly growing on the listener. Combined with their introvert and honest image they made a distinct impression on the scene. Posthum accomplish what many bands are merely attempting, which is to deliver a work of art that is complete in itself; and it needs to be said that they did this brilliantly Metal.de review of Posthum. 

Their next effort Lights Out (released by Indie Recordings) also received praise from a unified press core: the beauty of Lights Out stems from Posthum having their own clear identity and distancing themselves from the trve Norwegian scene. Its deeply refreshing - Metal Hammer UK

This time around, the band breaks the surface with their third album, The Black Northern Ritual. 
One would most likely expect something ambient and gloomy from the Norwegian trio, something similar to their more experimental second album Lights Out. 
That is though not the case. The Black Northern Ritual tears you apart with the opening Demon Black Skies. Jon`s voice is more aggressive, the guitars more up front and drums has a more thrashy approach than ever before.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Posthum">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
