Dave Derby's musical career began auspiciously as lead singer and bassist of 90's Boston-based alt-rock heroes the Dambuilders, a band once decreed by Spin Magazine to be the best "indie band in America." Shortly thereafter, the Dambuilders inked a major label deal (East-West/Elektra), released several critically acclaimed albums and imploded in the middle of a final fateful American tour. Returning to his new home in New York City, Derby recorded his first solo outing under the moniker Brilliantine and released two albums ("Vainglory" and "My Life and the Beautiful Game.")
Dave released his first acclaimed solo record "Even Further Behind" on Badman in 2003. Produced by Derby, Michael Kotch (Vitamin C, Mascott, Joanaspolicewoman, Lloyd Cole) and Thom Monahan (Pernice Brothers, Beachwood Sparks, Devandra Berrnhardt) the record was a glorious pop explosion.

Dave's upcoming record, "Dave Derby and the Norfolk Downs", was produced and mixed by Derby and features performances by Derby, Kotch, Lloyd Cole, Jill Sobule, Chris Brokaw (Come, Codeine, Consonant, Steve Wynn) Kendall Meade (Mascott, Sparklehorse, Helium), Ben Perowsky (Joanaspolicewoman, the Lounge Lizards, Elysian Fields) Vitamin C, David Poe, Joan Wasser (Joanaspolicewoman, Dambuilders), Kevin March (Guided By Voices, Shudder to Think, Dambuilders), Leila Mack, Phoebe Summersquash (Mascott, Godrays, Small Factory), Rainy Orteca (Mascott, Joanaspolicewoman) Chris Nakata (Ruth Ruth) and Jud Ehbrar (Reservoir, Varnaline). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dave+Derby">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
