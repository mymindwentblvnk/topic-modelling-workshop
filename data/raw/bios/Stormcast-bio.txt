Genre: Atmospheric/Melodic Black Metal

The band was formed in 2007 in Nicosia,Cyprus. It all started out just as a jamming session. Initially some songs by other famous bands were covered and then the band started to write their own material, and slowly try to find their style of music. After several live gigs with other local bands, and more and more songs being written, the band released their first promo cd with 4 tracks entitled "Scorched Earth", and has sold over 100 copies just localy. After a small lineup change in the winter of 2008, the band is continuing to write new material, explore their musical tastes and influences and most of all express themselves through writing songs.
