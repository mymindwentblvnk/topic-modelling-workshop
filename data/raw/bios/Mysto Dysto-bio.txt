Formed in 1983 in Coevorden, Netherlands, Mysto Dysto is truly one of Holland's Thrash/Speed Metal treasures. The band was named after an effect pedal which got very bad reviews. 

The band however was quite successful and even got the attention of foreign recordlabels. After two demos and a very notable album called "The Rules Have Been Disturbed" the band renamed themselves "Mandator", and released two more albums and a demo on a german label before splitting up.
