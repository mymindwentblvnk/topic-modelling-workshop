O.B.E.Y's absolute career began in late 2002 in London, UK...
Imagine, smoke trail of decent english "Five o'clock" spliff , with pint of cold Carlsberg in your hand... What kind of thoughts can run inside the heads of two, missing of sobriety, geezers? Well, infact it's not about creating the band or something like that. Why not? Because the stoned geezers already fucking are in the band.
Grim DarVeter(Jones) and iGore Insininrator(Smith) took a leading part in laying the foundation of O.B.E.Y on purpose to swim confidently in the ain'tstream of horned music. The first album "Ultra Heavy Low Frequency Variations" was the overdooming experience which was originaly printed as 100 promo copies and sent to underground supporters. Now it's fully available for download from Aggressor productions.
In late 2005 O.B.E.Y entered the studio for a couple of days for 24 hours to be exact and wound up with new so-called horned'n'heavy album in their hands, titled "Romance of Misanthropy".
The album represents a pure underground riffing noise terror, and pays back for the era when anti-holy thrash metal abuse took place. O.B.E.Y are not consider themselves belonging to any kind of scene, style, or movement , however allow themselves to play anything the spirit is willing to express !
