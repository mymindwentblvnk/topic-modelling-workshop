Overwhelming power hits you in the face when you listen to the MagnaCult's debut album "Synoré".

MagnaCult released its first record through Rusty Cage Records in May 2007. The press has been nothing but positive about the album 'Synoré'. And soon the live reputation of the band was growing bigger and bigger with every show that was played. Last year the band toured with, amongst others, the US metal-bands DEVILDRIVER, ILL NIÑO, SHADOWS FALL, FIVE FINGER DEATH PUNCH and Canadian all-girl metal band KITTIE. MagnaCult also headlined the Nerve Breakdown Fest (Tilburg - NL), Wantijpop (Dordrecht – NL) and they thrashed at the Headrock Festival (Almere - NL).

MagnaCult will enter the studio again to record, as of yet untitled, their second album to follow-up their successful debut album.

"We are very excited to enter the studio again and record our new material. A bunch of songs are finished and others are still in progress but it will be a hard-hitting record again", says drummer Bionic about the upcoming album.

MagnaCult made their mark in the European music scene and their highly anticipated second record will destroy you for sure! Be prepared for MagnaCult's unique sound… with Tom and D. thrashing on the guitars, bassist Spit delivering the low-end bass frequencies, the overwhelming drum-rolls pounded by drummer Bionic and the talented voice of MagnaCult given to you with brutal, melodic and in-your-face singing by Sebastiaan.
