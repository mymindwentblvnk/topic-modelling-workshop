Nottingham's Hordes of Satan (using drum machines and adding drone touches) founded in 2005, and features guitarist S.E. Toolin, who holds a wealth of credits with such acts as Pitchshifter, Taken By Wolves and many others. Vocalist / bassist 'Stumpy' has association with Heroin A.D., Mosh Baby, Taken By Wolves and many others. The 2006 eponymous LP included a cover version of Pitchshifter's "Landfill", lyrics originally written by Toolin's sister. The LP was released by Streaks Records in Germany and quickly sold out to distro's globally. Shows followed with the likes of High on Fire, Sourvein, Ephel Duath, Orange Goblin, Church of Misery. New album planned for 2009, although Stumpy now lives in Los Angeles and Toolin in Nottingham.
