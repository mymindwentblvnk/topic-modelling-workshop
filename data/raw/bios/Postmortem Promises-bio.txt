Since their formation in late 2005, Essex based Postmortem Promises have continually striven to grow, musically, lyrically and in attitude. After attracting a surprising amount of attention in the UK underground metal scene with their first, three track EP ‘We Play Weddings’ they were quickly signed to Thirty Days of Night records, alongside UK giants Bring me the Horizon. A self titled five track EP was recorded and released through TDON in 2006, which continued to enforce PMP’s unique sound through fusing hardcore and metal elements. 

Postmortem Promises spent the next few years playing over two hundred shows with bands such as The Red Chord, Despised Icon and Suicide Silence, all the while earning themselves a greater international fan base by exposing those overseas to their sound through websites such as MySpace and Facebook. 

It was in 2008 when PMP made their biggest breakthrough so far by signing with established UK metal label, Siege of Amida Records. This gave them all that they needed to power forward and write and record their ten track debut full length ‘On Broken Foundations’. With crushing breakdowns, huge vocal lines and hardcore breaks, this is an album which fully encompasses the past four years of PMP’s growth. This is not to say that the band haven’t evolved, with plenty of groove and even some lead lines being thrown into the mix also, this is an album with real concept.

Now, with some new members and a new album under their belts, Postmortem Promises are ready to strive once again for bigger things... <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Postmortem+Promises">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
