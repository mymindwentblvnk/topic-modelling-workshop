"The Mystic Astrologic Crystal Band" offers up an interesting mix of psych and what you'd call sunshine pop.  I've seen a couple of reviews that compare the LP to The Yellow Balloon and the comparison' wasn't too far off, though Hoffman's affection for the sitar and Grass' production touches gave this a far more distinctive psych edge.  Musically the collection was pretty much divided between the two genres, though Grass added interesting production touches to virtually every track - 'Early Dawn' shifted from great harmony rich pop to a weird phasing segment and then back again.  At least to my ears the psychier tracks provided the album highlights.  Among the more interesting numbers were the sitar propelled 'Factory Endeavor' (with an odd series of right to left and back fades), 'Barnyard Philosophy' and 'Publicly Inclined (To Blow Her Mind)'.  Elsewhere 'Flowers Never Cry' b/w 'Earl Dawn' was released as a single (Carole catalog number CAR 1004).   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Mystic+Astrologic+Crystal+Band">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
