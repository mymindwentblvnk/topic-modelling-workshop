Since initially forming in late 2005, goth metal band Ellsbeth-hailing from Los Angeles, California-have cycled through many members of the band, but the self described "honest" sound the band produces remains the same. Following the April 1, 2009 release of their debut album Well Dressed Killing Machine, guitarist/writer Sean Lacefield, vocalist/writer Shannon Quamme, guitarist Scott Ramsey, drummer Giovanni Fuentes and bassist Jim Dineen are poised for the domination they seek.

Well Dressed Killing Machine contains 11 hard hitting tracks and was produced by renowned  engineer Chris Spilfogel and Sean Lacefield in Hollywood, California's own Westlake Studios. Currently, the band is actively touring and supporting their album. 

The recently released album is gaining momentum and a cult following from critics and fans alike. Since the April release of Well Dressed Killing Machine, Ellsbeth have gained and held the #1 rank in Gothic Metal catagory in all of My Space. They have also ranked #4 in the Progressive Metal catagory and #22 in the Metal catagory. The debut album has been played 5,761,668 times by Ellsbeths undying loyal My Space fans.

"Eden and Say Goodbye tracks have great metallic groove, mixed with a striking melody..."It's a little haunting," said The Ripple Effect. Ellsbeth have also been described as Avenged Sevenfold without all the screaming and with female vocals."

"Hauntingly honest music" says Chris Spilfogel, Grammy award winning Engineer/producer(Dreamgirls, Hair Spray, Repo! The Genetic Opera)
