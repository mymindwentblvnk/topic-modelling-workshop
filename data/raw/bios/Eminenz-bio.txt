Black Metal band Eminenz, led by the fire breathing vocalist Leviathan, is a union of ex-Death Metal musicians, the previous influences plainly audible on the two albums. The group first came together during early 1989 with a line up of Leviathan on vocals, guitarists Zwerg and Butcher, bassist Darkman and drummer Iten. The band pulled off a huge coup of gaining the support slot to Mayhem on their 1990 European dates and followed this feat the following year by issuing a brace of demo sessions in 'Slayer Of My Daughter' and 'Necromonicon Exmortis'.

During 1992 Eminenz guested for a visiting CARCASS and delivered further demos 'Ghost', 'Preacher Of Darkness' and 'Blasphemy Live'. The band had by now been augmented by keyboard player Benedict Kern. The group's debut album 'Exorial' arrived via the Lethal label in 1994. However, shortly after it's release both Kern and Zwerg made their exit. By 1995 the gap in the ranks had been plugged by keyboard player Lorenzo and bassist Black Abyss, Darkman having manoeuvred over to the guitar role.

'The Heretic' album ensued capitalised on by support gigs to Mayhem once again and Marduk. Eminenz would then switch labels to the Last Episode label for 1998's 'Anti- Genesis'. Further line-up shuffles found Iten out and Heretic coming in on drums. This latest recruit would depart too though after laying down drums on the 'Blackest Dimension' album. Eminenz duly drafted Illeies on drums as well as Micha, the latter boosting Eminenz up to a three guitar compliment. Guitarist Karsten Breitung also operates Belmez.

Early demos would be collected together for the 2001 vinyl release 'Deathfall', limited to 500 copies. Late October of 2004 saw the band on tour in Europe, packaged with a heavyweight billing comprising Morrigan, Abigail and Anael. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Eminenz">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
