Marttyyrioperaatio was founded by Liisa and Jori in autumn 2004. The style of the music was already clear in the beginning 'cause Jori wanted to express his sickest perversions in gore way. Some songs were made with inspiration drawn from bands like Napalm Death, Regurgitate, Impetigo (especially vocalwise), Repulsion and Dead Infection and first rehearsals took place after a few months. As time went on the need of a decent bassplayer was coming ahead, so Frederik (at the time in Aborted) was asked to join in. Frederik would have been the perfect choice for MO (especially with Fr√©'s cool rockstar attitude), but the distance between Finland and Belgium was a bit too long so problems started to surface. Recording would have been impossible with the lack of decent studio equipment, so the next considered bassplayer, Oula, was found talented just enough and he joined the band quickly after.

The first demo 'Teloittaja saapuu' was recorded in 6 hours on 10.09.2005. It contained thirteen songs of noisy grindcore with gory lyrics sung in Finnish. Vocals were done by Jori, Liisa and Oula to make the songs sound as sick as possible. After finishing the demo they thought that the band should have a primary singer for even more brutal vocals and a more powerful stage presence. And so the line-up grew from three to four as the new vocalist Aki joined the band with his gut-wrenching growls.

New songs were made and they ended up becoming longer and heavier than those on the first demo. The goal was to make some ultra-brutal, cheese-ridden moshgore with less of the noisy grind and more death metal. The results are yet to be seen...  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Marttyyrioperaatio">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
