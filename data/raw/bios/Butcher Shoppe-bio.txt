There's not much known about Butcher Shoppe. They arose from obscurity with a full length album, "Meat" in 1999, and have yet to produce anything.  Metal-archives.com has nothing on these guys save for the last-known line up and the fact that they've split-up. It's not like anyone's gonna read this anyway. So, if you're aware of these guys, please, please share them. The music is amazing. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Butcher+Shoppe">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
