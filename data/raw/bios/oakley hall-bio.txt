Oakley Hall started as a project centered around guitarist/vocalist Patrick Sullivan (formerly known as Papa Crazy or PCRZ of Oneida).  

The lineup changed significantly after the recording of the first full-length album, but has since stabilized with Sullivan on guitar, vocals, and Hammond, Rachel Cox on guitar and vocals, drummer Greg Anderson, bass/supporting vocals from Jesse Barnes, Claudia Mogel on fiddle and backup vocals, and Fred Wallace on lap steel, banjo, and guitar.  

Their most recent release, Gypsum Strings is their third full length, and their second with the above lineup.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Oakley+Hall">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
