Magna Mater is a band from Western Massachusetts, USA. They were formed in early 2007 by four friends from Massachusetts and New Hampshire. While striving to disregard genre associations, their sound can be described as emotionally evocative, ranging from ambient and spacious to grand and powerful. 

All of their recordings are available for "name your price" download from the band's Bandcamp page (magnamater.bandcamp.com).

The original line-up consisted of Seth Newton on vocals, Eric Trabucco and Dave Jewers on guitars, Rod MacDonald on bass, and Brian Marcou on drums. The band has since parted ways with Rod MacDonald (in late 2007), and Dave Jewers (in 2010) . Seth assumed bass duties since MacDonald's departure. In late 2010, Paul Carter joined the band, playing keyboard and auxiliary instruments. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Magna+Mater">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
