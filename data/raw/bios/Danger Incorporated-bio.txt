Atlanta duo Danger Incorporated (Louie Duffelbags and Boothlord) make the kind of music that you thirst for but seldom find. Their debut album Are You Afraid Of The Danger Boys? is just that kind of rare gem that truly makes you feel excited. Featuring codeine infused dark trap and lyrics inspired by the Goosebumps books and the crude world of the internet, the duo has built an intriguing aesthetic that is unlike anything else. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Danger+Incorporated">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
