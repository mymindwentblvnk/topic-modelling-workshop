Archigram is Julien Mallart and Nicolas Trichet, two Parisian natives who discovered Detroit techno in the early 90's. Their tastes weren't exactly the same: while Nicolas learnt playing the guitar by listening to his rock 'n' roll heroes, Julien toured Parisian clubs as a DJ. Once they met, they started producing music, developing a style which is quite unique & a bit hard to describe: it's a sort of dark & rock house music where angry guitars are mixed with cold keyboards, but it has a clubby feeling. 

They began their career on Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo's (of Daft Punk) Crydamoure label in 2001, with the Mad Joe 12". The A side is hypnotic and captivating, whereas the B side, In Flight is more funky. One year later, Carnaval was released and we can already hear that their sound is darker. This feeling is confirmed by the even darker Doggystyle, released in 2003, a cover of The Stooges' I Wanna Be Your Dog. 

While their 12" saw some success in the UK, we had no news from the Crydamoure label, and Archigram returned on Kitsun√© in 2004 with Padre. Opening new points of view on house music, Padre has an obstinating harpsichord, which could be from a party at the time of Louis XIV, while the classical binary house structure is replaced by a more interesting ternary one, which breaks with already established rules.

Although plans for an album were discussed, it never appeared. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Archigram">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
