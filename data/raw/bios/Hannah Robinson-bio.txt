Hannah Robinson is a singer/songwriter based in the South of England, and has just released her debut album, 'Oil and Turpentine'. The album is a collection of original material, recorded at Room With A View studio in Hampshire. Hannah began singing publicly at the age of 15, and is now a professional musician.
Hannah's sings with a soulful, bluesy style – likened by many to that of Janis Joplin and Eva Cassidy. She has performed at both intimate and large venues/events, including Larmer Tree Festival, Mr Kyps, Salisbury Arts Centre, Bournemouth Folk Club, The Great Dorset Steam Fair, The New Forest Show, Bournemouth Air Festival and Freshfields Festival.
Hannah writes songs from personal experiences. Lyrics form from what she writes in notebooks; observations, thoughts and feelings.

Amongst a great number of blues, soul and indie artists, Hannah cites Sam Cooke, Dan Auerbach, John Frusicante, Willy Mason, Suzanne Vega and Bettye Lavette as strong influences.

With the release of 'Oil and Tupentine', Hannah’s music will be heard by new audiences in venues around the UK. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hannah+Robinson">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
