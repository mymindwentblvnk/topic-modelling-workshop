Blood Coven was formed in the fall of 1993 by ex-Sin-Eater guitarist/vocalist Dann Saladin. He was joined by drummer Andy Wiper and bassist Chuck Smith for the release of a raw rehearsal demo shortly after. The track "Statuary" was contributed to the "Midnight Offerings II" compilation CD in February of '94 and guitarist Dave Ingram was added in the spring to complete the line-up. All progress came to a screeching halt in the summer with the departure of Andy and Chuck. Dann and Dave continued to rehearse while searching for new members. They finally met with success in January of 1995 with the arrival of ex-Adnauseam drummer, Brian Kerr. The four song demo, "Dark Harmonies," was recorded and released in February to much acclaim in the underground and Bloodcoven resumed playing live, minus a bass player. Many months and many shows passed while an endless stream of bassists came and went. Jason Woolard (ex-Hate Theory) officially joined in October of '96, finally completing the Bloodcoven lineup. 

Presently, Blood Coven continues to play live locally and out of state. The band has warmed the stage for many national acts such as Mercyful Fate, Morbid Angel, Overkill, At The Gates, Cannibal Corpse, Carnivore, The Misfits and Dissection. The band is also preparing to enter the studio in January of '97 to record a full-length CD for Dimm Records. The CD is to be released in the spring and will contain eight tracks in the vein of "Dark Harmonies." Blood Coven's philosophy over the years has been that of musicianship and progression. The new CD will reflect that in a darker direction only hinted at by "Dark Harmonies." The best is yet to come...
