Started up in the early days of the norwegian extreme scene in Kråkerøy, Norway in 1990 year by the name Pendulum. Later changed the name to Carpathian Full Moon, and released the 7"ep "Caedes Sacrilegae (Alzbety)". Got signed as one of the first bands at Avantgarde Records, and released "Serenades In Blood Minor" in 1994. One of the most promising bands back then, but sadly split up few years later, becoming the progband Julia Dream with half of the Carpathian line-up.
One of two groups featuring guitarist Endre Begby (the other being black metal combo Abysmal), Carpathian Full Moon was a short-lived doom/death outfit out of Norway. Also including vocalist/drummer Henrik Pettersen, guitarist Jorgen Hansen, bassist Lars Lie and keyboard player Jon F. Bakker, the band's sole album, 1994's Serenades in Blood Minor was a very diverse set for the time, experimenting with strings, ambient acoustics and Viking mythology in interesting ways. But poor distribution guaranteed that it would go relatively unnoticed, and the band broke up almost immediately after its release.
After Carpathian Full Moon broke up, Endre Begby and Jørgen Hansen started a prog rock / pop band called Julia Dream.
