Heretoir (/ˈhɛrətwaʀ/) is a German post-black metal band founded by Eklatanz in 2006. The band name, consisting of “here-” from the English word “heretic”, and the French syllable “-toir”, is a fictional synonym for “going an own way”.

Conceptually, Heretoir deals with melancholy, nostalgia, isolation and self-reflection. The music is meant to be a soundtrack for discovering one’s deepest thoughts, fears and the soul that rests in each one of us.

The band’s beginnings were rooted in pure acoustic music but Heretoir quickly evolved into a combination of aggressive elements of black metal and the beauty, melancholy and reverie of post-rock and shoegaze. In its broadness the music conveys the daily myriad of feelings and impressions that our multifaceted world confronts us with.

After having worked with the Chinese label Pest Productions for over one year, Heretoir signed a 3-album-record deal with the German label Northern Silence Productions in April 2010. 

Since May 2010, Nathanael (Thränenkind, Bonjour Tristesse, Agrypnie live bass) has also become an inherent part of Heretoir, doing bass and backing vocals.
