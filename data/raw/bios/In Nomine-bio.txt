In Nomine is a Spanish Melodic Death / Black Metal group from Girona.

Making a little summary, the band project started in August 1998, and has experienced some changes in band members and its style. In the beginning , we started playing Black Metal. The band evolved over a few years in different ways, creating our own songs and sound, an atmospheric Black Metal style, achieving more technical and melodic skills, making it similar to Death Metal and Brutal Death. This musical evolution, as well as the continued team work resulted in what the band is today. We can say that we are proud of having our own songs and our own style.
In April 2003, we recorded four songs on our PC, which have remained there until today, although the sound quality did not satisfy us much. We learned two very important things: We had a vital experience to face a future studio recording session and also we achieved a final vision of our work.

In August 2005, we have produced a complete CD of eleven songs, called ETERNAL TORMENT, which has been recorded and produced by David Fern√°ndez (Baalphegor), in the Tribal Art Studio (Sils, Girona). At the moment we are working hard in order to prepare our next release. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/In+Nomine">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
