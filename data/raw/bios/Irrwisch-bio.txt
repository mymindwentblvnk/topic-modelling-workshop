A Dutch Black Metal band. See www.irrwisch.nl

Irrwisch, the Dutch Black Metal band, started in 2006 playing an atmospheric kind of black metal. Influences (although they may not be heard) are bands such as Lunar Aurora, Klage, Nocternity, Drudkh, etc. The band consists of members from Widergeist. For the demo 5 tracks were recorded.

Not to be confused with the much older, Swiss rock group by the same name.
