Flayed Disciple are a metal band hailing from Taunton, Somerset in England. Their style is unique and consists of a mix between Thrash, Death and old school metal. 

Guitarists Thurston Howe & Jon Whitfield met in 2007, when Thurston returned from two years at the Guitar Institute in LA. They instantly connected & knew they could create some impressive material. After searching for a committed drummer, they found exactly who they were looking for, ex BURNING SKIES drummer Phil Tolfree, who also being an impressive artist contributed greatly to the bands striking art. Shortly after the band overheard singer Tim Whyte rehearsing in a studio with his band MUTILATED CARCASS & instantly knew that he had the sound they were after so offered him the vocalist position straight away. 

After a successful UK tour with Seregon in 2009 & numerous gigs with renowned UK & US bands such as Brutal Truth, Desecration, Trigger the Bloodshed, The Rotted, Dead beyond buried, Infestation & fleshrot, the band are now ready to record a full length album, pursue record label interest & expose their sound to the world. 

Their first EP "Drawn Viscera" consists of 4 songs and now a re-release has been made featuring a re-recording of the song "Ejaculate While Killing" and a new song "Exodus" along with a video for E.W.K 

"SO SLOSH OUT THE CORPSE BUCKET, SCRAPE UP THOSE CRISPY ENTRAILS, PUT UP YOUR FEET AND ENJOY!!
