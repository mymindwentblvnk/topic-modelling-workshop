Icarian began their career during one hot summer. The bandmembers at that time didn't all feel the same about how their music should be expressed and so some line-up changes inevitably followed. The band found itself a steady form, and in 2003 Icarian released their first demo-EP “Refuse the sun, deny the light”. 
A lot of good critics followed both for the EP as for their extremely tight live-performances. 
During the following years Icarian again had to face a line-up change. They said goodbye to Ice and welcomed Stijn on vocals. 
Today this five-piece sounds more overwhelming than it did before and is sure to blast you away with both melodic as well as experimenting grooves. 
Icarian perfectly knows which direction they want to go, and more great opportunities occur for the band everyday. 
Icarian still sounds tight as hell on stage, with providing you an energetic live act!
