VOODOMA were founded in winter of 2002. After two demos the band released their debut album "Dimension V" in January 2004. Creating a style mixed of gothic rock and melodic metal the album was distributed by mailorder all over europe an received really good reviews. The songs of the album were really catchy and brought the band many appearances on the radio and live gigs at festivals. As a peak of their previous career VOODOMA played live at the legendary Wacken Open Air 2004.

In July 2006 after two years of intensive work the concept album "Reign of Revolution" was released. Obviously more into heavier sounds and profound lyrics, the songs topically deal with the abuse of power and crime caused by blind religious fanaticism. The album immediately got top reviews and gained some extreme good rankings in every well-known magazine. At the same time the band got live on stage again.

The so far most complex work "The Anti Dogma" is due to be released in January 2009. Modern metal with sophisticated arrangements and lyrics far beyond stereotype stuff will be combined to a sound thatÂ´s really up to date.
