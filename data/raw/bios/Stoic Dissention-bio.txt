When hell freezes over and the heavens collapse the soundtrack will be Stoic Dissention. Combining Black Metal, Doom, Post and a little grind to bring about an audio assault that eats away at the foundation of the psyche. From Peter's apocalyptic grooves and hellish blast beats to Isaac and Kelly's infernal dirge filled harmonies, Dave's pulse of decay bass and Zach's decadent chants and howls of despair, they've created a mighty force indeed. Featuring members from Acheronian Dirge, Centimani, Kastigation and Lobster Assault.
