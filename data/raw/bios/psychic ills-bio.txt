Psychic Ills is a psychedelic rock / experimental rock band from New York City, NY, United States, that became active sometime during 2003. The current line-up consists of Tres Warren (guitar, vocals), Elizabeth Hart (bass), Chris Millstein (drums), Scott Ryan Davis (guitar), and Scott Davis (keyboards).
Their sound has included a combination of rock experimentation, drones, electronic textures, and various ethnic influences.  Their live shows have varied widely and have been known to have an improvised performance art element as well.

Psychic Ills released their first full length album, Dins, in early 2006. The album's cover art is German Fluxus artist Wolf Vostell's painting Three Hairs and Shadow. The Village Voice named Psychic Ills "Best Psych Rock Band" in their 2006 Best of NYC issue.
In early 2008, Psychic Ills performed in Marfa, Texas for the opening of the Hello Meth Lab in the Sun art installation and at the Contemporary Art Museum in Bordeaux France for the IAO festival. In 2009 they released the album Mirror Eye and toured the US with Butthole Surfers. For 2011's Hazed Dream, the band moved to Sacred Bones Records and opted for a more streamlined, accessible approach. In Spring 2013 the band released their fourth album One Track Mind and toured Europe afterwards.

Members of Psychic Ills have been involved in various other projects. Elizabeth Hart plays bass with Effi Briest and performs with the improvisational dance and music ensemble Skint. Tres Warren collaborates with visual artist Taketo Shimada as Messages and with Drew McDowall as Compound Eye. Former drummer Brian Tamborello participated in the Boredoms Boadrum projects and played drums on Mike Wexler's record Sun Wheel. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Psychic+Ills">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
