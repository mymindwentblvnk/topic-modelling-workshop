"Since Jimmy quit playing drums in Soilwork 1999 he always wanted to play guitar instead of drums. About 5 years later he went to the bar and there he met Martin Langen. Jimmy told Martin his ideas about starting a new band.

Martin found Jimmy's ideas interesting and gave him his phone number. Martin didn't have to wait long for Jimmy's call and they set up a first meeting. They started jamming together in a rehearsal cellar in Höganäs, which they share with several other local bands. There was an immediate connection between their two musical minds. They stopped rehearsing and went out to town in order to get more band members.

First they found Johan the guitar player, Jesper the organist, and Erik who can growl so loud he sometimes gets scared himself. After several rehearsals everything seemed work, although there was something missing. That's when John came into the picture. The band thought they needed this young bass player, and as soon as they asked if he was in, he was a part of the team.

In the late 2006 Jesper Goude left the band. His replacer was Andrea Green, a nice pretty good playing girl. Beware the planet earth, Faithful Darkness are in progness!"

Early 2011, Richard Sjunnesson (ex-singer of Sonic Syndicate) joined as the new singer. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Faithful+Darkness">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
