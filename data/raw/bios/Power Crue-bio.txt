Power Crue were formed in 1986 on a clearly amateur level and after a lot of changes in their line-up during the first 4 years the band presented their first demo tape "Alive Again" in 1993.
   Then T. Bertsatos and G. Economou entered the band and they released their first album "The Sign Of Rage". Their second album was released in 1999, entitled "Stay Heavy". During the 4-year period which elapsed Power Crue composed songs for their third albun under the name "Nightmares".
   The band has performed a lot of concerts all those years and now they're writting their fifth album untitled yet.. Since 1993 and after their first release, Power Crue have had a steady line-up with the current members and they still stay heavy!
