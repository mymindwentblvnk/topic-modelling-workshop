Wij is a nocturnal six-legged, three-headed creature that crawls out of murky Warsaw cellars to play raw but muscular protometal with just guitar, drums and female vocals. 
The trio consists of Maria (a.k.a. Tuja Szmaragd) who contributes voice and lyrics, Grzegorz on baritone guitar and Miko on drums. 
‘Dziwidło‘ is their first full-length release, featuring ten band originals plus a Polish-language cover of ‘In a League with Satan’ (‘W przymierzu z diabłem’), originally by extreme metal pioneers Venom. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wij">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
