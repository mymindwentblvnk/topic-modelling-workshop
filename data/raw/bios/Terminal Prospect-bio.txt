Terminal Prospect formed in 2008 and has since produced three full length albums, Absence of Light (2007) and Redefine Existence (2013), as well as three EPs, Face the Horror (2012),The End of Dogma (2014) and Indulgence (2021). Last but not least came Fall from Grace: Live in RÃ¶mania (2017), which presents the band's raw live appearance on stage! The band delivers its blend of thrash, death and groove with energy and headbanging! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Terminal+Prospect">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
