ARRAYAN PATH (formerly Arryan Path) is the personal project of singer/songwriter Nicholas Leptos which came together in 1997 with guitarist Clement Fung, with help throughout the years from Nicholas' brother Socrates Leptos (as well as others).

Following their two demos (“Return to Troy”, 1999 and “Osiris”, 2000), the band’s debut album, “Road to Macedonia” was released in 2004 by Greek label Steel Gallery Records. 

After a six-year hiatus, the band released its second album in early 2010, “Terra Incognita”. Recorded at Maranis Studios in Germany and mixed and mastered by Vagelis Maranis (SANVOISEN), who also participated on one of the album’s tracks, this album was released by Cypriot label Pitch Black Records. “Terra Incognita” was nominated for IMPALA’s European Independent Album of the Year Award (the only metal nomination amongst 20 other). 

In November 2011, ARRAYAN PATH’s third album "Ira Imperium" was released, again by Pitch Black Records. This album features a guest appearance by Tony Martin (ex - BLACK SABBATH) as well as more guest appearances by Vagelis Maranis and others.

ARRAYAN PATH has played live in Cyprus and abroad and has also participated in various festivals, including Greece’s Up the Hammers in 2010. More live appearances have been scheduled after the release of “Ira Imperium” (featuring a guest appearance by Tony Martin) and already work has begun for the band’s fourth album, coming in 2012. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Arrayan+Path">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
