"If Tony Iommi and Nancy Wilson had a love child, his name would have been Dave Marrs. In 2005, after years of honing his talents, Dave met Brandon Malone, a throwback to older times, looking for someone to jam with. When Brandon heard Dave`s first riff, he wanted to have Dave`s love child, but settled for complementing his riffs with lyrics instead. It was then, that Southern Vein was born. After writing and playing all over Virginia for three years, Brandon and Dave `in order to to form a more perfect union` set out to find a new rhythm section. Enter guitar playing bassist Shane Rippey, who brought with him the creative and motivational surge to get them back, better than ever. The answer to their proverbial `prayers` for a modern day Ginger Baker were answered as Joss Sallade joined in on drums. 2009 saw the release of "The Witch is In" a 7 track EP. 2010 will see the release of a split EP with Lord and a Re-mastered re packaged version of "The witch is In" with Bonus Tracks.
