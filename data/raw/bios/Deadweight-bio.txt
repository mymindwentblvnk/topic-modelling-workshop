2. Deadweight (US) is an alternative rock trio from San Francisco, California. Playing the violin and cello through a variety of guitar effects, their studio recorded material is surprisingly hard rock. Live performances display an eclecticism that has conjured a variety of descriptions by critics. Examples include, "(howling) like something out of Beethoven's most twisted hallucinations," "Eastern European Gypsy songs sung in the back of a big rig driven across tornado country by the ghost of the Marlboro Man" and "Charlie Daniels in hell playing a combination of Bartok and Zeppelin." Barnes has stated both Jimmy Page and Charlie Daniels are influences for their sound. Deadweight were winners of the SF Weekly's 1998 Wammy award for the category of "Beyond."
