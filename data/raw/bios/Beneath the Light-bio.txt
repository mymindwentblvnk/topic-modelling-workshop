Beneath the Light are an alternative rock band from the United Kingdom, formed in 2006. Their music is a fusion of rock ambient and classical music, often emphasising the use of strings and piano. 

To date they have produced one demo, "Nightmares of Gentlemen" (no longer available) and are working towards their first effort entitled "The Internal Connection" that is set to make the transition from their old death/doom metal style to a more atmospheric and textured style in the same vein as bands such as Porcupine Tree and Anathema.

It is expected that the debut full-length album will be completed and released before the end of 2009. The band have stated that live performances are unlikely in the near future due to a lack of band members; they are presently auditioning a number of guitarists and vocalists. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Beneath+the+Light">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
