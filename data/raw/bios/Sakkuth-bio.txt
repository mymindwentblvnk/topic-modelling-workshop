Sakkuth is a band based in Brisbane in Queensland. They describe themselves as "melodic metal". They have been active in the Brisbane heavy metal scene and around Australia for nearly 10 years.

The band features Moises Contreras on Vocals (who at about 4'11" in height must be the world's smallest heavy metal vocalist), Scott McIvor on Guitars, Nathan Bruen also on Guitars, Vaughan Piffero on Bass, and Damien Biggers on Drums. Their previous guitarist Adam left the band to spend more time with his family in late 2005; this was one of the reasons given for why the band had to suddenly pull out of Brisbane's Overcranked festival.

Some of their members have previously been in other australian heavey metal bands. Damien biggers is a former member of Deceptive Creation/Gorgon, and Moises is a former vocalist for Misery.

Their most successful album was "don't fight the Urge" which has recently been re-recorded and re-released because the band were not happy with the original version. Their track Time and Sweet Nectar (a bonus track on the new version of Don't Fight the Urge) was included on the first edition of the compilation Full Metal Racket volume 1 released by Australia's music radio network Triple J in association with their heavy metal music program Full Metal Racket.
