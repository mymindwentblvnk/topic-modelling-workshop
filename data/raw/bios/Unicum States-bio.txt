Unicum States was a progressive metal band from Székesfehérvár, Hungary.

They were among the first progressive metal acts from Hungary, and were a major influence to the later years of hungarian prog culture.
Their style was somewhere between the old hungarian hard rock/metal bands (Edda, Piramis etc.) and the then contemporary prog artists (Queensryche, Dream Theater, Fates Warning etc.) creating an original mixture.

They released their debut and only album called "Különleges Állapotok" in 1994, consisting of 7 songs.

Their vocalist, Thorday Ákos, has deceased in 2003 (RIP).
