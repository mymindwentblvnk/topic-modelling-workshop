Aiming High is an alternative rock band that comes straight out of Ukraineâ€™s capital- Kiev. The band was formed in early 2012 when the members began rehearsing together for cover shows. After a long absence from rehearsing and playing shows, the band decided to get back together and record an EP. Alex, Vova and Nick, rehearsed old songs at garage-type studios downtown. 
In the end of summer 2012, Eugene Golovatenko agreed to help Aiming High record an EP and then later joined the band. The EP was poorly recorded and our friend who agreed to mix the tracks for us told us that it needs re-recording. Thus came the desire of a full length album. Ideas began getting passed back and forth, songs were altered, deleted, returned and created, and in the end of summer 2012 recording began. It took a lot of hard work, sound changes frustrations and sacrifice, but in the end it was worth the sweat. 
Aiming High have released their debut single on the 12th of December 2012, and are planning to proceed into the mixing stage of their album by the middle of January.
The album will range on a variety of different influences from different genres and will follow the concept of a Rock Opera. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Aiming+High">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
