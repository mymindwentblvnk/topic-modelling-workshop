Baliset is the name which Greg Massi began attributing solo works to back in 1996. 

In 1999 he began creating full songs in earnest with college friend, and drummer, Adam Letourneau. During breaks from the recording and touring schedules of maudlin of the Well and Kayo Dot from 2000-2006, Greg and Adam put together and crafted the songs that would eventually go on their debut album "A Time For Rust." 

In 2006, upon leaving Kayo Dot, Greg focused all energy into Baliset and with an album under their belt, and a live band ready to perform, Baliset is currently seeking shows in the New England/NYC area to help spread the word about their music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Baliset">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
