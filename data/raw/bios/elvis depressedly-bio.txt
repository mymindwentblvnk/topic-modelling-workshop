Elvis Depressedly stares straight into the void and airs their own blunt perceptions about it through their music, but it’s never been the band’s intentions to bring you down even if it says so right there in their name. Mathew Lee Cothran of Coma Cinema and Delaney Mills -- alongside a revolving cast of friends and collaborators -- have been taking the monoculture’s obsession with a dystopian world and turning it into their own wry joke in their homespun quarters of South Carolina from the very beginning. Since 2011, EPs and singles built with a bare necessity of instruments and production tools have recorded a memory box of self-healing guitar-pop laced with an Ambien trance. But with Cothran quitting his day job and resettling in Asheville, NC with Mills after the release of 2013’s Holo Pleasures to focus his efforts on their latest full-length on Run for Cover Records New Alhambra, an increased currency in time has resulted in Elvis Depressedly’s most definitive listen yet. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Elvis+Depressedly">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
