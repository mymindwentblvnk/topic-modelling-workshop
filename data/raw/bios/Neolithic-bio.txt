Neolithic is a Polish band from MÅ‚awa (later moved to Warsaw). It started out in 1991 strictly as a doom/death act, sounding very much like early My Dying Bride, with the faster parts reminding one of Cemetery of Scream first two albums. There is violin work present on some tracks on the first album, as well. Only the first two CD's can truly be considered doom metal. They have since evolved into a gothic-metal like version of Entombed! Still, recommended listening for fans of more 'up tempo' doom/death.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Neolithic">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
