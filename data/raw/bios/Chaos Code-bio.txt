CHAOS CODE were originally a Baltimore, Maryland-based band that formed in 1997 and included Orion Sound Studios founder Mike Potter, bassist Phil Rous, flautist/guitarist Cliff Phelps, keyboardist Marty Saletta and drummer Mike Farmer. Farmer left the band early to found the prog-metal band ENCOMPASS. This was quickly followed by the exit of Potter, and following the band's debut release, they disbanded. Saletta went on to join the space rock band DARK AETHER PROJECT, while Phelps soon reformed CHAOS CODE with former CEREBRUS EFFECT drummer Patrick Gaffney and AVERTED VISION bassist Gary Curtis. The reformed band's second album, "The Tragedy of Leaps and Bounds" released in 2002, followed by their most recent studio release "Propaganda" in 2005.

The band's music ranges from symphonic to heavy rock to jazz/fusion, and is characterized by strident brass, and biting, sometimes apocalyptic lyrics. Heavy use of mellotron and flute provide a base of 70's-inspired symphonic sound into which the band infuses 80's-influenced post-punk lyrical and percussion sensibilities, and mystic multi-part epics with a decidedly modern tone. The sound spans many moods and can be compared at times to KING CRIMSON, early SALEM HILL, and mid-career JETHRO TULL at times.

CHAOS CODE are a must-have band on the archives due to their complex progressive arrangements, heavy use of keyboards and symphonic instrumentation, and borderline RIO-inspired lyrics.
