Canadian heavy metal band, which was formed in 1980 as Death Dealer. After some demo recordings, they changed their name to Deaf Dealer, and recorded two albums in 1986 (Keeper of the Flame) and 1987 (Journey into Fear - which was never officialy released, just on a bootleg). Their style is very similar to what were Iron Maiden doing at that time.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Deaf+Dealer">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
