The new Americana. Dylan meets Waits meets lost love by the railroad tracks. Backed by members of the Reigning Sound, F*ck and Viva l'American Deathray Music, and recorded at Easley McCain Studio, Harlan's record has already been hailed as the best Memphis record of the last five years by the Memphis Flyer. And rightfully so- it's a purely, perfectly American album, wide open and alone with touches of melancholy, paranoia, loneliness, despair and simple hope coloring every little moment. Love will do that to you.

"Too Much Love" garnered the highest rated song of the week on NPR's "All Songs Considered"

Enjoy!
