Atomic Aggressor is a Chilean death thrash metal band formed in 1985 in Santiago, Chile. In 1989 they released their first demo, Bloody Ceremonial. In 1990 they recorded a promo cassette and sent it to various fanzines and labels. They were unsuccessful in getting signed, and after releasing another demo in 1991 titled "Resurrected" they split up. In 2008 the band reformed and recorded a new demo, which was released on Hell's Headbangers with their other two demos. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Atomic+Aggressor">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
