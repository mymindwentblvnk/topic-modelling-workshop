Anitras Garden is a young, undiscovered band from Switzerland playing progressive rock, though for the latest album "Serotonin" they decided to add some extra groove. 

Its band members are:
- Thomas Ackermann, Vocals
- Berthold David, One Guitar
- Thomas Piller, Other Guitar
- Aurel Baier, Bass
- Gerhard Baeriswyl, Drums

For living most of the band members do studying and elementary school teaching.

Besides their two albums "Anitras Garden" and "Serotonin", they appear also on a Sampler called "de seisa na". Serotonin has been recorded and mixed by them selves with a huge effort of the one guitar, huge effort also to find a consensus within the band, which was not always easy. 

The most eloquent element of the band is the singer, statement which sees itself confirmed at shows and the drums are focusing on technic aspect of the play. The future of the band is uncertain, as the bass has left the band and a major reordering in the band seems likely (as of june 2006). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Anitras+Garden">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
