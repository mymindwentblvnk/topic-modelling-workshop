Sizarr use a mixture of guitars, drums, synthesisers, loops and samples to create a post-punk sound. Deaf Sty’s vocals are reminiscent of James Blake and Jeff Buckley, but have a rawer rasp like that of Hamilton Leithauser from The Walkmen.
The percussion of Gora Sou uses live Latin rhythms on top of synthesised beats, not dissimilar to those found on Friendly Fires records.
The synth melodies and guitar hooks, often use a hypnotic rhythm as you’d find on Berlin Techno and Deep House.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sizarr">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
