Diablery is an epic black metal band from Greece which was established by Nimerius in the autumn of 2008. The current members are Setesh (vocals), Nimerius (guitar, backing vocals), Vaelor (guitar), Aranel (bass guitar), Nazfell (keyboard) and Revan (drums). In the band's own words, "diablery" is the kind of philosophy that worships Satan, that's why their lyrics refer to the spiritual development and to the decay of Christianity and any organized religion.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Diablery">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
