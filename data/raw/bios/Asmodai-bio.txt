Asmodai is a metalcore (or as the band describes it, a "hellcore") band from the United States. Some of their songs can be classified as deathcore. The band’s name derives from a demon known as Asmodai. It’s supposed to be an incest child of Tubal-Kain and his sister, Naami. It appears in the Bible and in various demonology books. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Asmodai">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
