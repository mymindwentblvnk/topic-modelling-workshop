The band was founded in December 2004. In the beginning some coversongs from Death, At the gates and Amon Amarth were played, but soon they realized that there was enough potential to make their own songs. 
So the band wrote 6 songs within a half year, which you can describe as melodic-progressive Death Metal. According to that, acoustic guitars, melodic solos and clean vocal passages give a very varied contrast to the sound of Dawn of Perception. In the middle of 2005 the band began to record a demo, entitled: fragments. It was completed in December and contains 5 songs. Because of the demo recordings, the songwriting was a little bit slowed down but now the band intensivly works on new material.
