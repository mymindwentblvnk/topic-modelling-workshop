Daemora is the creative outpouring of Timothy Coleman. It is much more the child of necessity than perfectionism, as like-minded entities have yet to reveal themselves to the cause.  Future additions to the band are entirely possible, and may be seen in the near future.
Daemora was conceived Walpurgisnacht, Year XL A.S. as a musical externalization of Coleman's necromantic psyche.  Born of the desire to bestow the (un)hallowed Doom genre with musical splatterings somewhat reminiscent of originality, Daemora takes great pride in failing miserably. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Daemora">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
