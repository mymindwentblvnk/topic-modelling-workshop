The seed of Mandragora Malevola germinated in Ereira, Coimbra, in the Autumn of 2013.
Formed only by Kaos (ex. Triba) on vocals and Igniferum (Everto Signum, Carma) on the instrumental, Mandragora Malevola celebrates the independence of expression without restrictions.
Grasping the meaning and secular history of the mandrake plant, the identity of the band comes from the roots of something evil that grows and takes over their music.
