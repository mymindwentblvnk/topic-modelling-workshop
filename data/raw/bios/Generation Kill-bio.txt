Generation Kill was formed by former Exodus frontman Rob Dukes and Rob Moschetti (ex-Pro-Pain, M.O.D.)

The original concept of the band was to break away from the current formula. By embracing their roots and incorporating them into the project Generation Kill is a true crossover band. Each song has its own identity, and mood, which gives the band its original sound without abandoning their influences.

By adding two lead guitarist/song writers to the band, a whole new dimension has been introduced to Generation Kill. While Jason Trenczer adds technical guitar work, Lou Lehman adds catchy riffs and solos.

The final ingredient to the band is veteran drummer Sam Inzerra. Sam has a Death Metal background which adds speed and power to the project. Each member of the band takes part in the writing process. While each member has established himself in legendary and underground bands, let it be known that this is no side project.

Generation Kill embraces their past to look towards the future.
