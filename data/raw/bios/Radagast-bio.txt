Radagast is Josua Karlsonâ€˜s Ambient solo project. Born in Austria 1994 he was already exposed to sacred, hypnotic music in his early childhood from his religious family background. Due to his work as a horticulturist and his fascination for mysticism and fiction his compositions are highly influenced by nature, folklore, environment, dream and inner worlds. https://radagasttenderofbeasts.bandcamp.com/ <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Radagast">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
