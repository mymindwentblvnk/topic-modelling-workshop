Knifer (better known by Knife) is a gangsta rapper born in Los Angeles, CA in 1999. Knife retired in 1999, and returned in 2003 with a new member, DJ Clueless. Knife is also the only rapper of Filipino and Spaniard descent to be labeled under Chicano rap since the genre is mainly rappers of Mexican descent. Although his style is generally considered Chicano rap, his ambiguous ethnicity may have caused him to declaim the genre, preferring to style himself as a "Maravilla rapper" or "Greenlight rapper", in the Philippines he coined his music Chavacano rap since Filipino rap is heterogeneous, encompassing rap in languages such as Tagalog, Chavacano, Spanish and Ilocano, as well as English. Knife is considered by many to be a driving force in bringing back the Gangsta rap scene and is regarded as the first (LaVeyan) Satanic rapper in the world. He was a pioneer of New South rap and a crusader of Alternative music, being one of the first rappers to embrace an antisocial persona without explicit irony.
