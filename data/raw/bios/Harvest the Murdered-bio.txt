HARVEST THE MURDERED is a progressive metal project featuring a few of the remaining members of Denver local bands APOCALYPTIC HARVEST and MENTALLY MURDERED. They combine separate, yet similar band styles to create a force which has yet to be harnessed and unleashed; iIncorporating everything from the sickest death, grind and hardcore elements, to traces of blues rock and dark melodic classical guitars. Currently preparing to take to the battlefields with a new bloodstained edge to the Metal/Grind/Underground community which has proudly stayed strong in Colorado for nearly two decades. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Harvest+the+Murdered">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
