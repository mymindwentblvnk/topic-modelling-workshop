Black metal band from Mississauga, Ontario, Canada - one-man project of Xaphlan.

Caliginous exists in stark opposition of all human systems and man-made beliefs. We abjure systemic control, deification and slave-master liturgy designed to create heirarchy or elitist-mentality.

There is no discipline in subservience. As a juxtaposition, there is no power in leading the reigns of the autonomously inept. The synergy between the two is failure and weakness. 

The expanded ideology at the nexus of this union is expressed through three directives known as the O.M., The Order of The Merciless

i. Obeyance yields weakness
ii. Singularity is the path to Supremacy
iii. Opponentism embraces Mercilessness

Through the means of solitary will, ineluctable predisposition and rite of black destiny, Caliginous mirrors the disharmonic and cruel extensions from the black void. Caliginous is anti-human death ritual rites projected through Astral Projection, OBE's and other lucid techniques through meditation, ritual and binaural experimentation.

For the glory of inhumanity, death to mankind
