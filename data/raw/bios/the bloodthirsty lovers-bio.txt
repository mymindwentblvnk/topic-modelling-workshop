The Bloodthirsty Lovers is a band based in Memphis, Tennessee. They recorded two records to date: self-titled "The Bloodthirsty Lovers" in 2003 and 2004's "The Delicate Seam".
The band is signed to Frenchkiss Records and happened to be the side project of (The) Grifters drummer Dave Shouse.
Don't look too long at the similar artists besides. The Bloodthirsty Lovers has little to do with the likes of Cold War Kids or Lucinda Williams. On their debut album they produce quite an electic sound which contains elements of electronics, indie rock, experimental and drone music.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Bloodthirsty+Lovers">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
