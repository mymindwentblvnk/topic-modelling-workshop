Infernal Necromancy began in 1996, when PSYCHOBLAZE created a one-man black metal band. During of the recording of the Bestial Holocaust demo (split with Deathlike Silence), ANALIEL joined the band as a guitarist. After the recording of the demo, the band split for personal reasons, but were reincarnated in 1998, this time with a full band lineup.The band pride themselves in playing "unoriginal primitive black metal". The style is similar to many early European black metal bands, characterised by raw, lo-fi production, and harsh vocals with Satan themed lyrics. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Infernal+Necromancy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
