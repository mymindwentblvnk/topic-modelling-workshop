In 2001, at the age of 15, Neil Engelen felt that there was more in house music than listening to records and visiting rave parties. So Neil decided to purchase a set of turntables and a crappy old mixer. He started experimenting with mashing up various music styles like industrial, darkcore and drum & bass, and after a while he was asked to show his skills at a small party. Necrid was born.

In 2006 it was time for Neil to take a new step in his career; he started exploring the world of producing music. After a while he teamed up with his good friend and colleague Ophidian and they spent some time in the studio, which resulted in his debut release on Bionic Recordings.

Originally a dj, Necrid will continue to spread his view on music throughout his experimental performances, but he surely intends to spend some more time producing music. Rough & Funky beats cominâ€™ at ya in the near future! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Necrid">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
