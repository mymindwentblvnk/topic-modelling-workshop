Originally from the sweltering suburban wasteland of Thousand Oaks, Brainspoon climbed out of the teenaged primordial ooze in 2004 with their debut EP, Brainspoon Rock and Roll. The band's latest album, No Damage, layers Daphne Vandervalk's spit-shined vocals and Michelle Balderrama's blazing guitar leads with enough roadhouse raunch to scare the most seasoned biker. With standout tracks like "Skeletons in the Closet" already certified platinum in their minds, Brainspoon can count on loads of future success. The band prides itself on their promptness and politeness, but when those stage lights come up, close the barn Mabel, it's going to be a rough one!
