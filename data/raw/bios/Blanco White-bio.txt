Blanco White started as the solo project of neo-folk singer-songwriter and Londoner Josh Edwards (born 21 June 1991) in 2014. After studying guitar in Cádiz (Spain), and later the Andean instrument the charango in Sucre (Bolivia), Edwards’ aim was to begin bringing together elements of Andalusian and Latin American music alongside influences closer to home.  

In early 2016 Blanco White released 'The Wind Rose' via Yucatan Records, a self-produced debut EP. A second EP 'Colder Heavens' was later recorded in the Autumn, this time with producer Ian Grimble (Bear's Den, Matt Corby, Daughter). The third EP ‘Nocturne’ was then released in 2018. 

His debut album ’On the Other Side’ is released June 5th 2020. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Blanco+White">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
