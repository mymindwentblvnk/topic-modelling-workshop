A folk-pop ensemble from Los Angeles, California, the five-member Milo Greene are largely centered around vocalist/multi-instrumentalist Marlana Sheetz, although the bandmembers share lead and background vocals and often switch instruments from song to song. Formed in Northern California around 2009, the group originally featured Sheetz, Robbie Arnett, and Andrew Heringer. After relocating to Los Angeles, the trio added singer/multi-instrumentalist Graham Fink and percussionist Curtis Marrero. Milo Greene released their self-titled debut album in 2012. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Milo+Greene">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
