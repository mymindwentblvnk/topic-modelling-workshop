Crown of Glory represents power, wonderful and catchy melodies, wicked choral lines and meaningful lyrics.

Crown of Glory are: Hene Muther (vocals), Philipp Meier (keyboards), Markus Muther (guitar), Hungi Berglas (guitar), Jonas Lüscher (bass) and Marcel Burgener (drums).

Crown of Glory is best placed in the field of melodic metal, with influences from AOR and power metal. Fans of Europe, Pretty Maids, Stratovarius, Royal Hunt and Edguy won’t be disappointed by the sound of Crown of Glory.

As a proof, the mini CD “Destiny” (2001) and “Spirit” (2005) received good to excellent reviews worldwide. “Destiny” was even chosen as Demo of the Month by the German Magazine “Break Out”!

On several occasions, Crown of Glory was able to show its potential live on stage, for instance as opener for Doro, Axel Rudi Pell, Blaze, Bruce Kullick, Candlemass and Shakra. During the year, they play approximately 15-20 gigs throughout Switzerland and Southern Germany.

In October and November 2006, Crown of Glory produced their first longplayer “A Deep Breath of Life” at the House of Audio Studios in Karlsdorf (Germany). The final touch to the CD was given by Dennis Ward (Pink Cream 69), who mixed the album in January 2007.
The longplayer is the result of a thoroughgoing band forging ahead: Having come a long way from their humble beginnings in 1998, Crown of Glory have, against all odds, never given up their love for their music and their belief in heavy metal..

It’s a must to see Crown of Glory live on stage – better even to hear them…but best of all is to experience them.
