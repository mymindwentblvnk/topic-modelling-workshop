The New Radicals were an alternative rock/power pop band that formed in Los Angeles, California in 1997, being centered around front-man Gregg Alexander, who wrote and produced all of their songs. They released only one album, 1998's 'Maybe You've Been Brainwashed Too', a critically acclaimed pop rock album heavily influenced by classic  rock and soul of the 60s and 70s that contained— amongst radio-friendly pop tracks and love songs— strong criticism of corporate America and modern culture. Aside from Alexander, the only other permanent member of the band was keyboardist and former child actress Danielle Brisebois. The remainder of the line-up was a fluctuating one revolving around the two of them, with the goal being to bring in a variety of musicians from many genres. 

The band is best known for their debut single, titled "You Get What You Give", which became a top 5 hit in the United Kingdom and has garnered major U.S. airplay for years. The song's celebrity-dissing lyrics at its end provided a minor a spectacle, with Alexander saying that the media misunderstood the meaning. Despite the song's radical messages, anti-materialistic as well as pro-youth, it's ironically been used in many films and even a famous advertising spot.

Tired of touring and promotional interviews, with the group becoming more and more commercialized, Alexander disbanded the group in mid 1999 before the release of their second single, titled "Someday We'll Know". He has successfully focus on writing and producing songs for other artists, winning a Grammy award for his talents. Consequently, the stunning "Someday We'll Know" received little attention in most countries. The band is widely considered a "one-hit-wonder". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/New+Radicals">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
