Gévaudan is a brand new project from Ottawa, Canada. While the music somewhat defies conventional wisdom regarding classification within the established hierarchy of musical genres and sub-genres, it carries with it enough familiarity to instill a sense of comfort within the listener. It has beauty, harshness, simplicity and a hateful nature. In the end, the music is irrefutably heavy, guitar oriented and riff based material – both traditional and chaotic at the same time.

Gévaudan successfully released an independent, full length CD entitled The Arrogant Chronicles – A Requiem for the Dead, a Deity for the Living, in June 2007. It contains 9 songs and two bonus MP3 tracks, clocking-in at 80 minutes total playing time. Digitally recorded at Sound Creation Studios using all tube technology, and professionally mastered at Sound Master Studio, the album exudes unbridled aggression, harshness and an innate beauty in its hateful nature. The release showcases material that is sure to see Gévaudan emerge as one of the most promising new acts in metal, today. The album is available online through The End Records.

Gévaudan is, without a doubt, a Heavy Metal act. Each member brings a unique quality and varied experience to the composition and performance of the music. The intent behind the project is to move forward relentlessly; continuously and consciously evolving both ourselves and our music to that nebulous “next level”. Along the way, we are actively seeking venues to play, billets to fill, and to satisfy – at least momentarily – the insatiable cravings of metal-heads everywhere with our in-your-face, primordial attitude! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Gevaudan">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
