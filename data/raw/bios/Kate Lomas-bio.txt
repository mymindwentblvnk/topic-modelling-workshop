This is singer-songwriter-producer Kate Lomas from Bath, UK. Dreaming about the wild side of life through her infections dream-pop anthems, Kate wants us all to party to her own brand of sad-dancing pop music.

Having commanded playlist support from BBC Radio 1 alongside regular features on BBC Introducing, including live performances at Abbey Road and Maida Vale studios, Kate Lomas is carving her own niche with her distinctively British self-produced indie-pop bangers.

2018 saw Kate release her dreamy single “Sweet Strange Days” a trippy journey that spent the summer floating through the airwaves in H&M stores worldwide. Following up with the pity-party-pop anthem “Drink 2 U”, Kate Lomas landed herself on Spotify’s New Music Friday playlists in Germany, France and Switzerland, as well as other major editorial playlists across Europe, amassing over 2 million streams in the process.

Kate’s ascending popularity didn't go unnoticed as she stormed performances at UK wide festivals including Glastonbury and The Great Escape Festival. 2019 saw Kate release anthemic dream-pop single “Happy Like This” coinciding with her debut TV appearance, performing for guests on BBC 2’s prime time TV show Great British Menu from the iconic Abbey Road Studios.
