Back in the late eighties, some friends formed a band… Demos were recorded and live-shows were performed under the name Epic Irae. In 1993 the name was changed to Quicksand Dream and they recorded to songs that ended up on a compilation CD (Metal North) together with a couple of other bands. The band split up back in 1993 but one of the members refused to bury the axe. Between 96-99 an idea grew stronger and stronger, which led Patrick Backlund to record the Aelin-project together with the original vocalist Göran Jacobson. This CD-R/Promo was released 2000.

The band (1988-1993)
Göran Jacobson - Vocals
Tomas Svedlund - Guitar
Patrick Backlund - Bass
Mikael Svedlund - Drums
During these early years, a couple of additional guitarists came and went. We always wanted to have two guitarists, but we never found a permanent member. Instead we called in our good friend Henrik Flyman to perform as guest musician on guitar a couple of times both in the studio and live.

(1996- present)
Göran Jacobson - Vocals
Patrick Backlund - Bass, Guitar

What the future holds is hard to predict, but it is said that new recordings will be done in a near or far future.is also quite possible to get the original vocalist and the original bass player together with a drummer, a lead- and a rhythm guitarist and start rehearsing for future live-shows.
