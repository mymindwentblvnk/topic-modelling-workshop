ReinXeed (now known as Majestica) is a Power Metal band from Boden, Sweden. They were formed in 2004 by vocalist Tommy Johansson. They are influenced by soundtrack movies such as Lord of the Rings and bands like Helloween with Michael Kiske, and Rhapsody of Fire.

In 2008, they released their first studio album, The Light, on Rivel Records. This helped the band land an appearance in Japan where they gained fans. 

Now known as Majestica, they changed their name in 2019 after a five year hiatus and a new contract with Nuclear Blast. 

The band has seven full studio albums out. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/ReinXeed">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
