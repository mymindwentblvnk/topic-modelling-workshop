Founded in Summer 2004 by long time friends and bandmates Christopher Dreamlore (Guitars) and Andrew Eriksson Vasa (Lead Vocals/Synth), Withered Dreams was created in the interest of combining the band's diverse influences of Black, Death, and Power Metal into a cohesive musical force. With the addition of Derek (Drums), Michael Mariah (Guitars), and James (Bass) the band entered Indian Trail Studios in November of 2004 to lay down their first single, Tranquility Dawns.

Shortly thereafter Michael was fired from the band due to personal and musical differences. James departed the band with him. Undaunted, the remaining 3 members entered Indian Trail for a second time in February of 2005, to lay down their second single, Spire of Decay, with Christopher filling in on bass as well as both guitars.

The band played their debut show in May of 2005, and then due to unfortunate personal circumstances went on a 2 year hiatus.

Returning to the Texas Metal scene with a vengeance in September of 2007, WD quickly found new blood with the addition of Steve Va'Nia (Bass Guitars) and Mike Sanchez (Lead Guitars). The band will be returning to Indian Trail in November of 2007 and will release the 5 track "Disobedience" EP in February of 2008.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Withered+Dreams">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
