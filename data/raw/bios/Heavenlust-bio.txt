The idea was born in 2004, in the south of Rome, Italy, within the mind of Luca (guitars) and Alessandra (vocals) and it became reality when Alessio (keyboards and guitar), Nico (bass guitars) and Simone (drums) joined the band. 
After some months the band became the first Italian Evanescence tribute band (Rain of Sorrow) playing a lot of gigs in Rome metropolitan area. In 2006 the true musical growing begins; covers aren’t enough anymore, the creativity starts to strike and pulse on them. 
They began to create their first original tracks, according to the gothic metal style (Evanescence of course, Nightwish and Within Temptation), many members changed and Marco (bass guitar) and Massimiliano (drums) joined the band that changed the name into HeavenLust. 
With this line-up, HeavenLust were finally born. In 2007, the band recorded their first DEMO cd “Close To Shadows” that includes the songs “Empty Memories”, “Black Stone” and “Secret’s Key” with a very great result. 
In fact, the demo cd caught the attention of many labels including Napalm Records (Germany) and Fuel Records (Italy). In March 2008 the band decided to sign a deal with the famous Italian label Underground Symphony for the release of their debut album. 
After some months of recording “Gate Of Endless Dreams” was released in October 2008. 
HeavenLust are now planning gigs all over Italy and Europe to promote the album and amaze gothic fans.
