Neuschnee was founded in 2006. They consist of 5 German and Austrian students who met during their studies of sound-engineering in Vienna – one of them singing, composing and mostly playing the guitar and the others forming a classical quartet. Recently they also work with external electro-musicians and drummers, but they originally work acoustically. 

The original idea was to combine elements of both popular and academic/classical elements.
They attempt to break the barriers of genres and clichés and focus on an adequate atmosphere for each song. It`s like forcing Nirvana to perform Schubert. 
Plus: They are awesome guys.

They are about to release their debut-record “Wegweiser” (“signpost”) in early 2008. 

The members are:

Philipp Treiber- Vl1
Florian Widhalm-Vl2
Ina Nikolow-Vla
Frederic Couson-Vlc
Hans Wagner- Comp,Voc,Git/Bass/Piano
