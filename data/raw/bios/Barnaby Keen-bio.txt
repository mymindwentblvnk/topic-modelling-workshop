In 2006 Barnaby Keen began writing a collection of songs whilst walking the Camino de Santiago in Northern Spain. Upon returning to the UK he then formed a group to perform with.
After a season gathering momentum around London, a self-produced album followed, ‘Tale Of A Waking Man’. New material and growing support sparked tours of France, Cyprus and the U.K where the group sold-out copies of the album.
In the following years Barnaby’s song-writing continued to develop and began to shift emphasis as the musicians experimented together. Growing input from brothers Nathaniel Keen (Andreya Triana, Sister Mary & The Choir Boys) on guitar/vocals and Oliver Keen (SoundSpecies) on Bass/Production formed a sound that now leaned further towards experimental psych-folk and prog-rock whilst retaining a hint of his self-confessed addiction to Brazilian beats. Drummer Dave De Rose (Moloko, Mark Ronson, Mulatu Astatke) began collaborating when he moved into the same acoustic-rich chapel in S.E London that Barnaby was living in. The hall of this chapel provides the sonic setting for the most recent E.P - Learnt From Love. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Barnaby+Keen">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
