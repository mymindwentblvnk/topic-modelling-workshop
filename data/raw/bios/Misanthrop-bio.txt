There are three German artists called Misanthrop.

1. Misanthrop is a Drum and Bass producer and DJ hailing from Stuttgart, Germany. His style could best be described as neurofunk. Misanthrop started producing a long time ago, being influenced by Position Chrome, Alec Empire, etc. He had a debut 12" on the German label Basswerk, but the release of his tunes "Perfect Happiness" and "Stop Criterion" helped his music to the breakthrough. He also released tunes for shadybrain.net and Mayhem`s Shadow Law Recordings.
He was caught up by the dark sounds and menacing beats of drum and bass in the nineties, as it developed more into an intense musical hybrid.
This is when he decided to produce his own tracks under the name Misanthrop, which enables him to use music as a medium to express personal experiences of human interactions. His musical arrangements symbolicly oppose to the lack of candour his aim is to break through the borders of conventions to set new unusal grounds.
With his debut on TeebeeÂ´s imprint Subtitles and his release on Mayhems Shadow Law Rec., Misanthrop gets heavy rotation with the likes of Calyx, DNAudio Crew, Mayhem, Noisia, Pendulum, Phace and Teebee.


2. Misanthrop is a Munich based Rap artist. He's basically a one-man-band, making beats, scratching and rapping almost at the same time. His German lyrics are very personal and sometimes dark.

3. Misanthrop is a Munich based Death/Black/Doom Metal band. Formed in 2005, they are about to release their first demo in early spring 2008 produced by kARHu.
