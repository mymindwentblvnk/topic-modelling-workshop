Against Me! is an American punk rock band formed in 1997 in Gainesville, Florida, by singer and guitarist Laura Jane Grace. Since 2001, the band's lineup has also included guitarist James Bowman. After releasing three studio albums through independent record labels (Reinventing Axl Rose on No Idea records, and As The Eternal Cowboy and Searching for a Former Clarity on Fat Wreck Chords), Against Me! moved to Warner/Sire Records for 2007's New Wave, which reached no. 57 on the Billboard 200. White Crosses followed on Warner/Sire in 2010. In 2011, the band launched their own record label, Total Treble, to independently release future recordings.

In 2012, Grace publicly came out as transgender. After a long period of line-up changes and uncertainty surrounding the band's future, their sixth studio album, Transgender Dysphoria Blues, was released independently in January 2014 to critical acclaim. The band's seventh album, Shape Shift with Me, was released in 2016. In addition, the band have four well known EPs: Crime as Forgiven by Against Me!, The Acoustic EP, The Disco Before the Breakdown, and New Wave B-Sides. They have released numerous singles, two live albums, and demo versions of the three of their studio albums.
