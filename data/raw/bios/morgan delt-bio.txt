Psychic Death Hole, the ultra-limited six-song cassette released in December 2012 introduced the world to Morgan Delt's self-produced, genre-bending flavor of brown acid-dosed flowerdelia. Equal parts 'Odyssey & Oracle' and ‘Parable of Arable Land’, Morgan Delt's self-titles début LP, Morgan Delt (January 2014), expands on those initial tracks and brings forth one a fully realized glimpse into the California native’s twisted brain.

Morgan cites influences from Curt Boettcher to West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band and rounds it out with golden age sunset stip heavies like The Byrds and Love. It's all in there: obsessively studied, mastered and then mutated. Morgan Delt's music worms its way into your brain and takes hold. 

As Morgan so keenly described his notion on the current state of genre bending music, borrowing from Kurt Vonnegut's 'Slaughterhouse-Five': “I think we’ve become unstuck in time and everything is going to happen all at once from now on.” <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Morgan+Delt">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
