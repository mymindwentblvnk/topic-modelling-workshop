Apostate is a doom metal band from Ukraine.
Apostate was formed in 1993 in Lviv (Ukraine). Their intention was creating dark atmospheric doom metal. The first demo “Consign to Oblivion” was recorded at White Troop studio in 1995. This tape was very well received by Ukrainian underground press and fans. In 1997 appears an EP "A Song of the Dead Lake" which contains four tracks of dark, sorrowful death-doom metal. The band split-up in 1998, all members except Yuri Lesnyi (vocals) formed Forgot Belief. In 1999 Yuri gathered new line-up and continued Apostate, but in 2001 the band finally disbanded. In 2007 compilation "From Consign To Oblivion to A Song Of The Dead Lake" was released. Its positive feedback was the reason why Oleksandr Kostko (bass guitar) decided to resurrect Apostate in January 2009. In 2010 an album called "Trapped in a sleep" was released.
in 2015 was released their album "Time of Terror"
