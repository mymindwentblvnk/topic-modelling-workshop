Die Prinzen are a German (sometimes a capella) pop band from Leipzig, Germany. Four of the seven band members sang in the famous "Thomanerchor" (St. Thomas Boys Choir) in Leipzig. Wolfgang Lenk (tenor) and Sebastian Krumbiegel (tenor) attended the same school in Leipzig and founded a band called "Phoenix." This band became "Herzbuben" in 1987. Later, Jens Sembdner (bass) joined the band. In 1989, Henri Schmidt (baritone) became a member of "Herzbuben". "Herzbuben" evolved into "Die Prinzen" in 1991 with Tobias KÃ¼nzel (baritone) as their apparent lead singer.
