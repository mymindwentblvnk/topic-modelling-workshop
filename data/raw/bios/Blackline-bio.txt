There are two bands named Blackline:

1) Blackline was formed in 2004. Formed in Boston, Massachusetts, they grew a hard rock feel. As a whole, they play with deftness, with a masterful command of the sound that radiates from their instruments.  The influence of Metallica can be felt throughout the album. They released their debut album "blackline" in early 2006. Steven (vocals), Nathaniel (guitar), Matt (bass), and Jerry (drums) combine to make a heavy and emotional feel to their music. their first single "Armageddon Soul" is a popular song with fans. There was a music video in production at one point, but was canelled.  New songs are in production, such as "The Misery" and a new CD should be along the way.

2) Black metal / noise from Australia. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Blackline">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
