The Thousand Faces is the current solo project of Fleet Street frontman John White.  His debut release under this moniker, "A Light Will Be Thrown", was recorded in just a few short weeks in his bedroom, and shows the eclectic range of styles and influences that have informed John White's songwriting for years.

A follow-up is planned for early 2010. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Thousand+Faces">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
