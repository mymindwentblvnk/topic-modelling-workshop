What Great Fangs is a southern metal band comprised of five musicians that reside just outside of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Creighton Hill (Vocals) and John-Mark King (Guitar) snatched up Sean Calangelo (Drums, ex-Maritime Militia), whom, ironically, had been living one street away from John-Mark their entire lives and never knew it. Disheartened and looking to put their talents to use, these individuals decided to combine their past attempts into a brand new project. Just several months after forming, the band stormed the Pittsburgh music scene by winning the 2011 Altar Bar Battle of the Bands. Since then, they have stayed as busy as possible and routinely venture into the Steel City to showcase their breathtaking live shows. Despite several line-up changes, What Great Fangs pressed on and never let anything discourage them from continuing to make music. After recruiting Johnathon Porter (Guitar, ex-Comfort In The End), the bandâ€™s already uncanny chemistry only grew further.
