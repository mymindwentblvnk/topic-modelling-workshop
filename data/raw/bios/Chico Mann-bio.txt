Since 2003, Chico Mann has been recording freshly vintage dancefloor hits, displaying the crossover between Afrobeat and electronics and becoming a worldwide underground sensation. Chico Mann consists of Marcos "Marquitos" Garcia (beats, guitar, keys, and vocals) with live support by musical cohorts Jeremy Wilms (bass, keys, vocals) and Wilder Schwartz (keys, electronic drums, vocals) of the NYC-based band Chin Chin, Mayteana Morales (vocals, percussion) and Vinia Mojica (vocals).

The debut album, Manifest Tone Vol. 1, was created by Marquitos Garcia in-between touring the world with Antibalas Afrobeat Orchestra. Recorded in a tiny room with an arsenal of vintage Casio synthesizers, drum machines and guitars, the result is an all-out party, with equal parts of infectious choruses and social commentary. Chico Mannâ€™s unmistakable production style creates a potent musical cocktail.
