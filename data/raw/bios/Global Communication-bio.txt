Global Communication is an ambient techno/ambient house duo, formed in 1992 in the United Kingdom, comprised of Tom Middleton and Mark Pritchard. They are best known for 76:14, an ambient album that sits alongside the likes of FSOL's Lifeforms and Aphex Twin's Selected Ambient Works 85-92, as one of the high-points of ambient composition within UK '90s electronic music scene.

As Global Communication they have released two studio albums. The first, in 1993: a full album remix of Chapterhouse's Blood Music, entitled Pentamerous Metamorphosis, and their masterpiece of ambient house, 76:14, in 1994.

Their EP releases include: Keongaku EP in 1992, Maiden Voyage in 1994, The Way / The Deep in 1996, and The Groove in 1997. 

To date, Global Communication has released three compilations: a remix album entitled Remotion in 1996, a DJ mix album entitled Fabric 26 in 2006 (1/2 by Mark Pritchard, 1/2 by Tom Middleton) and in 2011 another DJ Mix entitled Back In the Box . Their two studio albums have also seen reissues: Pentamerous Metamorphosis remastered and in a slightly edited version in 1998, and 76:14 in 2005 (a 10-year anniversary remastered re-release, with additional content on a bonus CD).
