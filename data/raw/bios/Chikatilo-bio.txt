Belgian slam death metal band.

Biography:
"Three young musicians (Evert, Ilja and Kjell) got together late 2011 to play the music they want. Very slowly the mistake of nature they call: Chikatilo was taking form. progress was painfully slow in the beginning due to the fact that it was nearly impossible to find a good drummer. One drummer came but with only one rehearsal done he just quited. Also pretty random sid joined by just filling in for Ilja at a rehearsal, next week he was also there and that's how he became part of Chikatilo. later a second guitarist came but he also quited. Finally after a year Yannick decided to join the band as the drummer and started blasting live into Chikatilo. Progress was made, songs were written and now we are finally here. an EP will be recorded soon! no idea when but it will come!"
