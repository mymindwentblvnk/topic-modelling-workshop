This band is not a NSBM band!

This band started with the vision. A vision to create something that will strike the hearts and minds of fellow listeners like thunder from the sky. It was all clear: the band was created in which music and image was equally important and had a special identity for each member.

In this time full of mistery and unsolved, we find our inspiration to rise from that. The story begins at the end of 2008. The band was created by Kob and Vortran. The material was written in a few months to represent our strenght and toughts. At the begining of 2009. the other band members joined.

Now was a time to strike the studio and record it. They went to the one of the best studio's in Croatia to record demo called "Follow The Blind." After a week or so the final product is here. Dark, mid paced song structure with ocasionaly fast paced tempo represents what Prognan stands for. Black metal in all its meaning <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Prognan">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
