Kerosin’s world seems like a playground of possibilities. A place where every story gets its stage and every feeling is given expression. Fear, softness, hardness, fun – everything is packed into texts, sometimes seriously, sometimes playfully. Kerosin revolves around topics such as the relationship to oneself, the world in its heaviness and how to deal with it. There is contra and criticism on the program – and Kerosin with a big grin on stage. They try to create spaces in which confrontation can take place.

Besides small odes to queerness and energetic beats, fragile, very personal songs are presented. Lightness and brokenness carry the listeners alternately in highs and lows and allow them to quickly find themselves in the songs. An unusual honesty opens the view for essentials, without forgetting the fun. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kerosin95">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
