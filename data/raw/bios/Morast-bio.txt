2. The story of the band began in 1994-95 when the Members (Dan&Pierre) met and decided to jam. Dan has played in bands since 1990 (Black Candle,Nefast…). After the jam session (smashing some thrash, black, doom & death metal riffs) it was clear that they both wanted to form a band together. The more they played, the more they drifted in a more Sabbathesque-Sound mixed with 70's & 80's ROCK&METAL. It took a while to find a bass player. But in the year 2000 a black cloud of tragedies fell upon them that forced them to stop. Now, 8 years later they are back, even more motivated, hungry, stronger than before.

3. German black metal trio, that only recorded some demo songs. Split release with Xtrident. On ice since 1998.

4. Death-metal band from Cherkassy, Ukraine.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Morast">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
