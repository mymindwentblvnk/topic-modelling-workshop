"ASTHMA CASTLE formed during the summer of 2008 in the Land of Pleasant Living (or so says Mr. Boh) by good friends just looking to get away from it all and have a good time playing good music. After taking their time putting some music together, it was apparent that they had something unique on their hands and joined with Durv Viswanathan and Serious Studios in early 2009 to record their debut EP "Jesus, Mary, and Broseph." They're totally stoked to put some shows together, get trashed, and rock your fucking socks off! "
