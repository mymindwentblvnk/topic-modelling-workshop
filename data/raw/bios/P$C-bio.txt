Unveiled in a national sense on the Hustle & Flow soundtrack (with "I'm a King" and "Murder Game"), P$C (short for Pimp Squad Click) -- an Atlanta rap crew featuring T.I., A.K., C-Rod, Big Kuntry, and Mac Boney -- released the album 25 to Life in September 2005. They had been together for several years prior to that and cut their teeth by touring across the South. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/P$C">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
