Though named for a parasitic plant, there was nothing quite so parasitic about the obscure Entophyte's sole LP, End of Society's Sanity, which follows largely the wave of highly progressive power and thrash hybridization that was prevalent in the sounds of Toxik, Watchtower, Mekong Delta, Psychotic Waltz, and Realm around the turn of the decade. Comprised mostly of members from demo level thrash bands, there is undoubtedly a wealth of talent on exhibition here, if ultimately no trailblazer of memorable writing. For such a low-key release, the production is actually quite good: the drums are a bit poppy and loud for my tastes, but the guitars sound excellent, as do Harry Kortboyer's nasally transitions from Fates Warning-like sadness to barking aggression, and an occasional death grunt.
