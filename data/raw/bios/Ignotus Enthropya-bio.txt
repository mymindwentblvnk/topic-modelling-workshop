The band was formed in July 2009 by guitarist Christian Alexander Oppitz and bassist Balázs Molnár (ex-Twister, Rektális Szerzetesrend), who met through the latter's ad for additional musicians for his new project. The initial musical vision was inspired by melodic death and progressive metal, with complex song structures, technical guitar solos, and athmospheric keyboard groundwork combined with harsh vocals.
After the first few jams and an enduring search for members to complete the line-up, the core of the band came into form with the addition of drummer Turcsák "Turi" Bence (Ex-Limb for a Limb, Kill With Hate), second guitarist Ádám Gerhes and keyboardist Bálint Kemény (Ex-Niburta, Númenor, Elanor). Songwriting commenced for the first instrumental demo shortly after, to promote the new band and to find a suitable vocalist.
Dávid Gazdag (Ex-Singara) was found eventually as the group's singer in 2011, and preparations began to perform live as well. Ignotus Enthropya's stage debut happened in april 2012, and the band did a few shows throughout the year, however, by the beginning of 2013 they were without a frontman once again. The vacant position was later filled by Turi's friend and former bandmate Zsolt Lédeczi (Effrontery, Teurgia, Deathstruck), and work began on the first official release.
After months of silence, the band finally returned to stage in March 2014, and in September, the debut 4-track EP, entitled "Solid Silver" was also released. By that time, Bálint Kemény has left the band and was replaced by Mátyás Martinka. Ignotus Enthropya is now stronger than ever and eager to promote their music worldwide in every possible way!
