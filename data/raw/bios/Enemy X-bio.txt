Enemy X is a five-piece melodic groove-metal band based in Southern Minnesota, USA. (Vocals – Steve Thaemert, Guitars – Chris Miller and Chris Lynch, Bass – Jerry Birr (formerly of bay area band Vio-Lence,) Drums – Mike Kimes.)

In January 2018 Enemy X released their self titled album the first with Steve Thaemert on vocals.  Thaemert hopes the music will resonate with Enemy X’s existing fanbase while also growing the band’s audience. “The songs are emotional, genuine. I think they’ll connect with people.”

Regarding the new album, Enemy X guitarist and producer adds that “the recording and production process had a much smoother streamlined approach this time around. I feel the result will be a big punchy Sonic joyride that will leave our fans wanting more.”
