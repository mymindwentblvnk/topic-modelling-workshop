Hellhaunt is an old school black thrash band with crust and industrial influences from North Holland, featuring dark ambient shaman Vulture.  Excellent for fans of later Darkthrone, Satyricon, and Order Of The Vulture, and anyone who likes their tunes raw, gritty, and loud. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/hellhaunt">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
