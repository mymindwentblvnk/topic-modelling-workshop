Biorhythm is the brainchild of Rubix Qube, Lunar and Crypsis.

Based in Cape Town they are an explosive live act and perform through powerful, high end quality production. Over the last 2 years they have moved their production skills onto the dance floors, and have quickly been snapped up by some of the biggest South African Production companies to display their live show. With a debut Album coming out on Disasterpeace Records in late 2009, this brainchild can only progress. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Biorhythm">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
