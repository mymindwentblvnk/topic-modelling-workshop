Bas Blasta started his career on Nice & Smooth’s second album Ain’t A Damn Thing Changed, on a posse cut titled “Down The Line” along with Asu, Guru, Mello T, & Preacher Earl. He then released his first solo 12″ single “Ain’t Whatcha Do” produced by The Beatnuts in 1994. He followed right after with “Dangerous/bw The Rhythm” produced by The Groove Merchantz. Kid from Kid N Play has some background vocals on the chorus of “Dangerous” and “The Rhythm” is a posse cut with Fat Joe, Godfather Don, Juju of The Beatnuts, & Lord Finesse. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bas+Blasta">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
