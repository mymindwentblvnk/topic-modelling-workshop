1.  Weapons is an indie/rock band from Reykjavík Iceland. Their music could be described as melody driven “in your face” indie rock influenced by good-feel indie, old-school garage and surf pop music.

In the summer 2007 the trio recorded their first LP, "A Ditch in Time". They hooked up with NYC producer Gordon Raphael (The Strokes, Regina Spektor) who joined forces in the finishing of their first born LP. In 2010 Weapons started recording a new album and created a remix album with RAC.

Consisting of Justin Griffiths, Georgia Griffiths (two siblings of another Welsh singer, Jem), Mo-laudi Bopape, Pete Cherry, Blair Macann & Tasha Baylis, Weapons are tipped to become big things in the UK music scene.
