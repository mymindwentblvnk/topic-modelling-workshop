There are two bands named Gloria Victis.

1) A Dutch symphonic heavy metal band. 

2) A Canadian metalcore band.


1) Founded in 2007 by 'Bozzy' (Vocals / Grunts) and 'Goof' (Lead guitar) in Almere.
Later on 'Mauske' (Keyboards) , 'Tit-m' (Bass) 'Sik' (Guitar) and 'Nap' (Drums) joined the band.
Besides playing their own songs like Deimos and Phobos, they play covers ranging from Judas Priest to Megadeth. Special cover on the setlist is their translated version of the Vortex classic "Open the Gate", renamed "Open de Poort".
The band started playing gigs in local bars but were soon seen outside their local scene, playing in Amsterdam and Assen, opening for Martyr, Hysterica and Vortex (playing the Vortex classic Open the Gate together, but translated to Dutch as "Open de Poort")
In September 2009 Tit-m announced that he would leave the band.

2) Made from former members of many local bands (A Liar's Truth, Left to Drown, Watch Your Step, etc), GLORIA VICTIS is already known as one of the most promising band in the Eastern Township's hardcore scene. With a wise mix of progressive melodic Hardcore, GLORIA VICTIS has shared the stage with many bands such as Counterparts, Structures, Blind Witness and several local bands. After only six months of activity, they will begin this spring their first Quebec and Ontario tour with Obliterate. Their first album has been noticed for its extremely professional sound, produced and mixed by Mat Laperle from the Red Dusk Studio. GLORIA VICTIS, a band that won't be soon forgotten. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gloria+Victis">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
