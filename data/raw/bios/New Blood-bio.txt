Biography
New Blood are an extreme metal band spawning from NSW, Australia. Since their inception in 2005 they have fermented into a focused unit of uncompromising stature.

Inspired by the obscure, their compositions are bound with a deep darkness and intellect that is conceived for their own immoral contentment.

Their Debut Album ‘Subsistence’ (meaning: inherent within) is a journey into the deepest darkest voids of human nature. Some of the most chilling fiction has no doubt been inspired from actual events, but what has lost focus is it is these real life scenarios that are more horrifying. Taking accounts from some of the most obscure and chilling ‘Serial Killers’ throughout history, Subsistence deals with the concept of the suggested influence or persuasion of a metaphysical ‘Entity’ which is ultimately responsible for the ability of man to distort and create one’s own perverse reality.

The release of ‘Subsistence’ in July 2012 has been soundly received with an east coast Australian tour and national radio exposure. 2013 has seen the 5-piece dominate the Sydney Extreme/Death Metal circuit gaining support to acts such as Thy Art is Murder, Cattle Decapitation (USA), Psycroptic, King Parrot and most recently Nile (USA) and The Faceless (USA). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/New+Blood">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
