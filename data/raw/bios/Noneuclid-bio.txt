NONEUCLID, formed in Bavaria / Germany in 2004 by Netherlands-based composer Morean, consists of members of a.o. Dark Fortress / Triptykon / ReVamp / Thulcandra and The Hungry Gods. 

After only three weeks, they produced their first album, "The Crawling Chaos" - a concept album about the violent and inevitable death of the universe. The acclaimed American poet Andrew Hughes provided the lyrics for the album. Musically, NONEUCLID strive to open doors to unknown psychic spaces. 

While being firmly rooted in extreme metal at all times, they freely blend style elements of death, thrash, black and progressive metal into a unique and gripping concoction. Virtuosity and complexity are not treated as absolute values, but as mere means to achieve a deep and advanced musical vibration. 

They use unusual instruments such as custom-made sculpture instruments (by German artist Ralf Fischer) and arabic instruments, as well as subtle electronic and classical influences to explore the rich sound kingdom of extreme metal to the fullest.
