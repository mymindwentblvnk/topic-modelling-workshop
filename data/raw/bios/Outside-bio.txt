Outside is a name of, at least, three bands:

1) An acid-jazz duo of Matt Cooper and Andy Allen, who released five albums: "Almost In", "The Rough and the Smooth", "Discoveries", "Suspicious" and "Out of the Dark" - plus various EPs / singles, between 1995 and 2001. 

2) A French neo-prog band compared by their label, Musea, to "Genesis in their "Wind And Wuthering" period as well as Marillion's neo Progressive, though calmer and less dramatic". They have released at least three albums, including SAME, Freedom and - in early 2011 - the limit.

3) A post-hardcore/shoegaze band on Head2Wall Records.

There are also references to Belgian, German and Polish bands of the same name. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Outside">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
