Jh, on his influences, states "My early influence was a melancholic vision on this earth. The lyrics i wrote had themes such as depression and suicide. But now, I realize that the majority of those bands are fake, And i don't want to be a part of that.
I do not love this existence, But i accept my life for what it is, And that's the reason why i making this music. To deliver my love or hate." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Life%27s+Illness">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
