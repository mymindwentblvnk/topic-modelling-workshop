2) Electronic music artist

1) Spawned in early 2011 and hailing from Iceland, four depression 'patients' decided that it was time to transform the negativity of the tormented mind into music, for others to relate to. After finding a local shithole to rehearse in and jamming through heavy weed or hash smoking and alcohol abuse, Naught was born and turned out to play very Stoner influenced Doom.

Naught was always bound to turn into tormented music, and with time, distress and overwhelming irritability, Naught naturally crawled towards playing Sludge with more alcohol abuse and harder hangovers.

Naught plays music as heavy as the weight on the modern mans shoulders, and their approach to the music and poetry is very personal.
Naught Shares a member with the morbid Black Metal project, Vansköpun operating under the banner of www.barghest.co.uk 

In early 2013 Naught finished recording a 25 minute debut EP called, Tómhyggjublús, or Nihilists Blues.
Naught has yet to find a label to release their crushing debut Ep. Since 2011, Naught has gone through minor member changes, but the lineup was sealed 2013.

2) Naught, a break centric alias of the electronic music artist Alien Nesby (23) was spawned from the bowels of Akasha (Casey Baldwin and A. Nesby).  During the Akasha writing period, Nesby found himself writing a good amount material geared towards the project alone; this would ultimately result in the creation of Naught, a fusion of Alien’s own acid and industrial origins coupled with the electro-bass and funky breaks sound of the Florida electronic dance scene. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Naught">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
