Nova Orbis emerged in 2005 as a musical project that explores the sound of symphonic, progressive rock, and metal including the use of several voices and instruments like flutes and keyboards. Its name is taken from the latin name of the new world that appears in several maps of the XV and XVI centuries. Its members have been previously involved in different bands of classic rock, gothic metal, symphonic metal, heavy metal, and vocal groups of classical music.

Their fist album "Imago" was released in 2009  with 10 songs, getting mixed reviews around the world.

Currently (2012) they are working mastering their new song "what I once Was" that will be released in the next months.  They are also working in the arrangements  of an EP set to release  december 2012.
