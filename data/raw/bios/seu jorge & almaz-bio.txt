Seu Jorge (pronounced in Portuguese: E-see-eh-ooh Zhoh-zhee, with "zh" sounding like "Zsa" as in Zsa-zsa Gabor) is a Brasilero (Brazilian for male national) from the favelas (ghettos) of Belford Roxo in the State of Rio. He demeanor exudes "legal" (cool) and he has this deep throaty voice that seemingly "can only" come from the Brazilian Portuguese landscape. He is best known in America (and the West) for the soulful David Bowie covers in the movie "The Life Aquatic" - captured in the album "The Life Aquatic Studio Sessions" (listen to the track "Starman" in particular).

He has also released a couple of his own albums ("Carolina", "America Brasil"), along with doing collaboration work and movies. Notably his deep and smooth voice is showcased in the mixed lounge song by "Bid" featuring Seu Jorge called "E Depois". This track has been featured on many albums including "Brazilian Lounge" by Putumayo.

Debut Album - this album he shares stardom with the three other musicians on their new album, simply titled "Seu Jorge and Almaz". This album takes a brief moment to take in, it's a uncharacteristic to the typical Brazil Sambas drawing gringos to record store racks. It has this pyhscodelic trance surreal quality about it and feels aloof giving it an instant "legal" (legal is slang for 'cool' in Brazilian) feeling like a strung out rock star.

While no new ground is being covered with this album, the groove is tight, the chops fresh and surreal off key sounding. The sounds are slightly jazzy drums, smooth vocals, and supple bass lines; it's an example of a good organic album. In fact, NPR (National Public Radio) named it number #1 Latin Album for 2010. A strung out and trippy cool album, featuring tracks in both English and Portuguese is must have for any discerning world music fan.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Seu+Jorge+&+Almaz">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
