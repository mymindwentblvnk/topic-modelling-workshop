The idea for Adeia first came to classical violinist Laura ten Voorde a few years ago. Finding herself at a personal crossroads she decided to make a radical turn and create something entirely new, closer to her heart. Not feeling satisfied within the boundaries of classical music the concept for a new band was formed, which would combine the aggressiveness and challenging sound of progressive metal with the lyric melodicity found in the symphonic music of the romantic era.

The band was formed while most of the members were attending the conservatory in Rotterdam. They created a sound comprised of classical melodies, progressive rock elements and a nice dose of heavy grunts, growls and guitars. The dark piercing lyrics make for a haunting listen that will keep surprising the listener. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Adeia">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
