This "balls to the floor" power trio from Nottingham UK has just released their full length debut album.

Deeply political at times, hilarious at others Th'Engines have shown us the world is doomed but you can still crack another beer and watch it go tits up with a smile.

Influences including;
Roy Harper, DIO, The Mahavishnu Orchestra, Megadeth, AC/DC, Thin Lizzy, Black Sabbath, Jethro Tull, King Crimson, James Taylor, Death, Elf, Ronnie & the prophets and Meshuggah to name but a few.

More album tracks to come soon, along with new unreleased demo's etc.

Order your copy of the album while stocks last. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/the+Engines+of+armageddon">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
