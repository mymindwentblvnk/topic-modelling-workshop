Acroholia was formed in 1991 by four guys from Belgrade, Serbia (then Yugoslavia). The operative word was grindcore as the band tried to emulate the sound of the late eighties Napalm Death. 

A typically local band, Acroholia has over the years had a very uneven live schedule, playing live mostly in Belgrade and Serbia. Playing Obscene Extreme Festival in Czech Republic in 2006 remains their only international show to date. In Belgrade they have played with bands like Pungent Stench, Gutted and Cripple Bastards, as well as dozens of local death metal, black metal, punk and grindcore bands. 

The band has done three demos (1992 and 1995) which were featured on a number of casette releases, compilations and splits all over the world. The first demo ended up on their side of a split 7" EP with Intestinal Disease, put out by a Slovenian DIY label Abnormal Beer Terrorism at the tail end of the nineties. The only album the band made to date, Ecocide, was published by a local label Rock Express on CD and cassette in 2002.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Acroholia">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
