It’s quite telling that when Glasgow super label re-configured their various guises and re-launched as Numbers, their debut release was from the two members of Lazer Sword, a gargantuan solo split 12” from Lando Kal and Low Limit. Lando Kal’s personal production journey started over eight years ago, producing more sample based stuff inspired by all the Bay Area, weirdo, independent record stores he worked at (including Amoeba) before bringing in more electronics. His music is a freaked out juggernaut of electronic music, primarily experimenting with various mutations of house. Dense instrumentation, analog synth and drum machine work, complex melodies, and creeping basslines are pooled from his musical obsessions with 90's RnB, classic house, freestyle, garage, Detroit Techno, early synthesizer music, Timbaland, and… to be honest, everything in between. It’s also indebted to his experience set as an integral player in both San Francisco and New York’s underground club scenes (he was a resident at CassetteNYC with Machinedrum, Praveen and FaltyDL) .A recent import to Berlin from San Francisco via New York City, Lando embodies a unique style all his own. Soulful, emotive and slightly outside the box, retaining a crucial dancefloor sensibility throughout.

Lando Kal’s distinctly heavyweight solo releases can be found on lauded US and European labels Numbers, Hotflush, Rush Hour, Sugarcane Recordings and Still Cold, alongside blazing remixes for Montreal’s Hovatron, San Francisco’s Salva and New York’s tribal super duo, Sepalcure (Machinedrum and Praveen).  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lando+Kal">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
