Black Sugar is a peruvian latin rock band which formed in Lima, Peru in 1970. They played latin style folk rock with strong jazz and funk influences in the 1970's. In their short lifetime, they released two LPs and three singles. In 1975, the band was formed by  Víctor “Coco” Salazar (lead guiatrist), Miguel “Chino” Figueroa (keyboards), Roberto Valdez (bass), José Luis “Arrocito” Cruz (drums), Antonio Ginocchio (trumpet), Jorge Chávez (alto sax), Coco Lagos (1st percussionist), Miguel Salazar (2nd percussionist) and Carlos “Pacho” Mejía (vocals).
In 1969, Víctor "Coco" Salazar and Miguel "Chino" Figueroa formed a band called Los Far Fen, the name coming from the Farfisa organ and Fender amplificator, which conformed the band's electronic amplification equipment.
In 1970, the group was renamed to Black Sugar by Jaime Delgado Aparicio, the at-the-time artistic director of Sono Radio. They published their debut Black Sugar the next year.
Black Sugar II, their second LP, was released in 1974.
"Muevete, Muevete / La Camita 78" was their last single, published in 1978.
In 2011 the band announced a series of concerts as a celebration of the 40th anniversary of their debut album.
