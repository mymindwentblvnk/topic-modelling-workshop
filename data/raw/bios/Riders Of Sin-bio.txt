Riders Of Sin is music by Connor Tolson recorded at home, using a guitar, percussion, singing, and all other sorts of things. But when playing live Riders Of Sin becomes a band of stellar chums, endevearing through fuzzy tones and psychedelic revelations. They channel influences from the 60's, with reversed guitar, wailing  solos, and catchy hand-clapping and whistling; and has been describes as a sort of 'down-to-earth space rock'.

Riders Of Sin have made and self released four albums so far, 'Sister Ray' - nov2010,
'Riders Of The Sun' - july2011, 'Psychoactive Summer' - nov2011, and 'Tocahontas' Feb 2012
