Deptford Goth is the stage name of British experimental pop producer, singer and ethereal and spectral R&B artist Daniel Woolhouse from Peckham, Southeast London, UK. Woolhouse started under that name in late 2010, when he decided to fuse his songwriting roots in guitar and piano with a more electronic approach. Describing his music as „sitting somewhere between real and synthetic“, the art school graduate debuted in late 2010 with the single Real Love Fantasy, which set electronically tweaked vocals adrift on blurry synths and a spare beat.

His debut EP, Youth II EP, was released October 17 2011 by Merok Records. His debut album, Life After Defo, followed two years later, on March 18 2013. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Deptford+Goth">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
