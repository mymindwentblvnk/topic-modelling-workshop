With songs that range from relentless mid-tempo churns to subterranean crawls, Batillus (buh-TILL-us) cohere the extremes of heavy music into a surge of massive riffing, rolling over and descending on the listener with the force and intensity of a sudden storm.

The band recently finished recording 'Concrete Sustain,' their second full-length and followup to 2011's acclaimed 'Furnace.' The new record, which will be out in March of 2013 via Portland's Seventh Rule Recordings and Berlin's Vendetta Records, was recorded and mixed by Sanford Parker and Batillus at Sound Generation in Manhattan and Hypercube in Chicago and mastered by Collin Jordan at the Boiler Room.

Originally conceived in 2007 as an instrumental trio, the Batillus lineup expanded in 2009 to add vocals, synthesizer, and samples to the dynamic range of their music. The tight and focused songs on 'Concrete Sustain' reflect this expanded palette, which has had a profound effect on the band's writing process.
 
In addition to 'Furnace' and splits with Australia's Whitehorse, Brooklyn's Mutilation Rites, and Maine's Hallowed Butchery, Batillus has recorded and released a pair of EPs on their own, both of which are now sold out. They have toured with Indian, The Atlas Moth, Mutilation Rites, Kowloon Walled City, Whitehorse, Hull, Salome, Author and Punisher, and Theologian, among others. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Batillus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
