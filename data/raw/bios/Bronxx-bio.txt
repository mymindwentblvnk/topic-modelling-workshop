Bronx is a gangsta rapper from the hood streets of Staten Island. He orginially is from Brooklyn, but he unfortunately moved across the bridge. Most of his songs feature four of his good friends all of which reign from Brooklyn : Pat Attack, Digitom, Lettuce (sometimes), and Nigga Loc (on rare occasions). These ghetto ass hoodlums keep it real with their fresh rhymes and ill beats. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bronxx">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
