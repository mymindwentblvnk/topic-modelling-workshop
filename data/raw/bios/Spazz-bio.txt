Spazz were an influential American powerviolence band. They played a fast and heavy style of hardcore punk that, along with contemporaries like Dropdead and Charles Bronson, helped extend the underground legacy of powerviolence well into the 1990s.

Spazz bassist Chris Dodge's record label Slap a Ham was a fixture during the rapid rise and decline of powerviolence in the late 80's and early 90's, releasing very influential records by the likes of Gasp, Neanderthal, No Comment, Crossed Out, Infest, etc. The label's Fiesta Grande was an annual powerviolence festival held at 924 Gilman back during its heyday from 1992 to 2000. Spazz drummer Max Ward's label 625 Thrashcore has started their own festival, Super Sabado Gigante, in a similar vein. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Spazz">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
