There are two bands called Feeble Minded:

1.) Feeble Minded (-fm-) is technical brutal death metal from Rokycany (Czech republic)

The band FEEBLE MINDED meet with an echoes from surrounding in 1998 after recording stuff MEANWHILE WE'RE ALIVE. In 1999 -fm- had played plenty of gigs also with more famous bands. 
In autumn 1999 the new guitarist Erik followed the band and -fm- played only new material. The promo named CML-5 was released - 5 songs recorded at home. Racy death music with grind influence made the band ready to play more gigs and fests. 
A record HATE FEELING was sampled in November 2000 and released as a split CD with LIMITS OF NESCIENT in March 2001. The CD was released by GRODHAISN Productions together with COPREMESIS Rec.
In the following two years, -fm- had played about 60 concerts in the Czech Republic and abroad. In 2002, Erik was replaced by the new guitarist Banjo and our electronic drums were replaced by live drummer David at the end of the year. 
The year 2003 has been dedicated to CD MY ANOREXIA, that was released at GRODHAINS Prods. again. It's a first recording with the live drummer (six pieces are played by Lille of German DEFEATED SANITY, one by David). -fm- are still receiving very positive comments on the CD and live shows. Another changes in the end of 2004 comes on guitarist and drummer posts. Instead of Banjo was Erik back and David was replaced by Wena. In year 2005 Erik leaves -fm- again.

2.) Feeble Minded was a hardcore/thrash band from Cary, NC. The band formed in early 2008, and after only playing a few shows, became renown in the area for their agressive speed, high energy, and incredibly short songs. The band recorded an eight song demo later in the year with song topics including mainly skateboarding, puking, and Chinese food. They later began recording an EP but disbanded in Summer 2009 before it was finished. The tracks of the EP that were finished were released on a tape entitled "The Grip Tape". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Feeble+Minded">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
