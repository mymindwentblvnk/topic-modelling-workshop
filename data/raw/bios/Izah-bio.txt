Hailing from Tilburg, The Netherlands, IZAH takes elements of sludge, post-rock, hardcore and black metal and blends these into a dark and gloomy mix of heavy riffs, downhearted melodics and densely layered sound dynamics. After having released two EPâ€™s, IZAH played numerous shows with the likes of Baroness, Mono, Cult of Luna, Celeste, Wolves in the Throne Room and The Ocean.

In 2015 IZAH released their debut album Sistere with an album presentation at Roadburn Festival. Sistere, for which the band joined forces with producer Jochem Jacobs (ex-Textures), has become a heartfelt 72 minute long musical narration through darkness and light, hope and despair. In four heavy atmospheric compositions IZAH takes the listener from serene post-rock passages to crushing hardcore grooves, from dark ambient to free form noise and from hypnotising black metal to massive walls of sludge.
