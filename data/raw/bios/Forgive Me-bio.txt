"Forgive Me" was formed by Lozmodial (Lord Azmo) back in the year 2009 from Jordan... and continues to this moment. The concept of "Forgive Me" revolves around the constant fact that: '99% of humans ask forgiveness before Committing Suicide'. And If we read some suicide notes we will glance the word "Forgive Me" is writting over and over again..
