Black/folk/viking metal from Stord, Norway.


Nordavind was founded in October 2004, during a late evening over a table full of beer. Bjørn, Øystein and Daniel had already talked about starting a band some time before this night. Geir joined the party that evening by a coincidence and became the second guitarplayer. Thus the first line-up was complete: Bjørn on bass, Øystein and Geir on guitars and Daniel behind the drums. Øystein became our vocalist as well.

The band was very unexperienced (Bjørn, Øystein and Daniel had never touched an instrument before!), but made quick progress. Our first goal was to play on a local "show off" concert in January 2005. We performed a cover version of Burzum - Lost Wisdom with no serious troubles. Along the way before that concert Øystein gave up his guitarplaying and became Nordavinds permanent vocalist. Shortly after the performance we lost our rehearsal room, so Nordavind became a studioband.

Autumn 2005:
 -Daniel left us, and gave up the drums. It was quite depressing for a drummer not to have a place for rehearsing.
 -Bjørn became Nordavinds new second guitarplayer as well as handling the bass.
 -Geir became the bands synth player as well as being the first guitarist.

Our first demo was recorded in Rune Nesses studio during January and February 2006. This was a huge turning point for the band, as we finally got a chance to record our work with decent sound quality. Session members in the production were Rune Nesse on drums and Nina Ihle Hadland on female vocals. 

Nordavind has been a studioband until 2007. We have recruited three new members in 2007, Håvard, Irene and Bjarne.
