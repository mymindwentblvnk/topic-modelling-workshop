Clockwork Protocol is a metalband which was formed in 2007 in Odense, Denmark. 

Clockwork Protocol consists of Nikolaj (Vocals), Nord (Guitar), Nick (Guitar), Thomas (Bass) and Tristan (Drums). With each member having experience in numerous other bands, they stand together to make the music they present today. 

Clockwork Protocol, the Danish metalband, is a band that combines the raw metalcore vocals and groovy Californian drumbeats, to make a metal-structure that burns into your memory and doesn’t let go. 

One moment you’re singing along on the harmonic chorus and the next your headbanging until your ears bleed to the powerful verses and heavy breakdowns. With drums that keeps you away and catchy melodies, Clockwork protocol brings a setlist on the table, which is guaranteed to get you to hum their songs several days after the show is over.
With Clockwork Protocol, there are only 2 things you need to ask yourself; Are you fit for fight or are you ready to lose both your voice and your neck for the next couple of days?
