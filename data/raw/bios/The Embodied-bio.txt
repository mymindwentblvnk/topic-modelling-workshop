THE EMBODIED roots back to 2006. Melin and Mortensen began writing music and allied with Ahlberg and Marcus Thorell. In 2008 the band took a leap into serious business with their music and recruited Janossy on drums. They recorded an EP-Demo and landed a contract with Pure Legend Records (Germany) to record their first full length album.

"The Embodied" (self titled 2011) was a success and received praise from around the world. In Sweden it was voted one of the best debut albums and ended up on the top ten albums of the year.

Following touring around Europe the band began writing for the next album. Even though it took 5 years, in 2016 "Ravengod" was released and again the band was saluted in reviewers and by their audience.

After the release of "Ravengod", Thorell announced his departure from the band as he had other priorities. There was no conflict and together the group looked around for a replacement.

In 2017 Lizette "Lizzy" Didriksson was announced as the groups new fronter, but parted with the band in 2018.

In 2018 Marcus Ehrenholm joined the group with blistering vocals.
