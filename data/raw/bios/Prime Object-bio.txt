PRIME OBJECT was first established under the name of Ungoliant in Izmir TURKEY . In 2005 their first demo Disciple was released. This demo included 5 songs recorded by using attack record technique. Since the demo album has been released, PRIME OBJECT carried out several live performances and the audience responded positively. With the begining of 2007 July PRIME OBJECT selected 9 of their existing songs and officially started to prepare their first album . The band is still carrying out live performances in process of recording.

Their music can be defined as the combination of dynamic, melodic and emotional guitar riffs , technical drums, strong scream/ brutal male vocals and clean female vocals.

Although the band forms its bases from the style it is affected, PRIME OBJECT combined the effects of this style with the experience of the members. PRIME OBJECT focuses this combination on its musical reflection. The main objective of PRIME OBJECT is to delectate the listeners with its melodies and touching soul of their listeners by using their sound. We expect this objective to be everlasting so that PRIME OBJECT will continue to compose bewitching tones...  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Prime+Object">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
