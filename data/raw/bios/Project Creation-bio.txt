Project Creation is Hugo Flores' progressive rock/metal band with influences of ambient and world music.They were formed in Lisbon, in 2005 and since then they have been playing wonderful,relaxing and atmospheric music, yet with powerful guitar work. With almost no use of complex technicallities (except of ocassional irregular measures) they create such a progressive music.

Hugo Flores recently created a brand new project called Factory of Dreams, with the album POLES now released! http://www.progrockrecords.com/shop/view.php?id=163 or http://www.mindawn.com/albums/4562
