Godzilla On Demand was formed by Smudge (Ex-Deimos) and Peeps both founding members of Unborn Son back who have now disbanded. They were originally called Godzilla On Demand, or G.O.D. The 'Demo Of Doom' was the first lot G.O.D material to be released which was a 3 track demo which was mainly to see how the band sounded and the sound was slow, heavy doom. They then quickly followed that up with 'Godzilla On Demand EP' which had more melody to the songs and a much tighter sound in all. It had 5 tracks and lasted for 28 minutes.

They are currently in writing brand new material for a full length album entitled 'Funeral Hill' which should be out later this year on Black Winter Recordings!
