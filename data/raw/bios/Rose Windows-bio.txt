Rose Windows was an American psychedelic rock band from Seattle, Washington, United States. 

The band was started by songwriter Chris Cheveyo in the fall of 2010 in the Central District of Seattle, Washington. The project began with a few rough demos done alone at home and slowly began to take shape as the band amassed members. Bandmates were primarily friends of Chris Cheveyo. Rabia Shaheen Qazi began provides vocals, David Davila performs on piano and organ. Former bandmates of Cheveyo, Nils Petersen and Pat Schowe were enlisted for electric guitar and drums. Richie Rekow and Veronica Dye play bass and flute respectively.

Label-less at the time, Rose Windows began making plans for recording The Sun Dogs in November 2011. The band sought out local producer Randall Dunn based on his past success with Sunn O))) & Boris, Earth, and Master Musicians of Bukkake. Other local musicians were later brought on board to add harp, pedal steel, viola, and cello.

In June 2013, Rose Windows released their debut album, The Sun Dogs, for Sub Pop Records.

The band follows standard Western traditions in their instrumentation, using the basic tools employed in past decades of American and British rock music. Elements of The Band's folk-infused rock, The Doors organ-driven psychedelia, and Black Sabbath's blues-based dirges can be heard in Rose Window's debut album The Sun Dogs.

The band announced via facebook on March 30 2015 that they would not be continuing on as a musical group, and all future appearances cancelled.
