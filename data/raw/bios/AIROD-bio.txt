Producer/DJ based in Paris.

Label owner of Elixyr.

Hailing from Paris, Dario Brkic aka AIROD is perhaps one of the finest incarnations of what the French techno scene can bring to the table when it comes to turning any cold-walled warehouse into a proper coal-fired furnace. Since he broke through on an international level in 2018 with his debut solo 12" on Molekül, drawing instant support from the likes of Dasha Rush, Blawan, Randomer, Kobosil, to name but a few, AIROD's kept forging his own strain of techno, both dark and muscular, blustery and tirelessly corrosive. A shared bill with French techno ace Amelie Lens at REX Club would soon seal Dario’s fate, prompting Lens to get him on board her highly reputed Exhale parties across the Globe, of which he’s since become a mainstay.

Taking their collaboration to a new extent, AIROD's inaugural 12" delivery for Amelie's label Lenske - the aptly-titled 'Voltage' - finds him delivering a quartet of high-octane dancefloor wreckers that promise to get the pressure gauge into the red zone effortlessly, no matter the hour of the day or the baking level of its audience. An increasingly in-demand talent, Dario also joined Dax J's Monnom Black stable in the meanwhile, contributing a track to the label's eagerly anticipated debut VA 'The World Of Monnom Black', alongside some of today's techno's most renowned big guns. A meteoric rise to supreme power for the Parisian producer, whose touring agenda has gone from busy to chock-a-block in a jiffy, and we grant you this, ladies and gentlemen, is just the beginning.
