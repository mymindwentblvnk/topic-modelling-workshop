Vakslen is an international Black'n'Roll/Black Metal band founded by V (Morgh, Ãžurs), and Stein Akslen (Blodsgard, V0id&Khaos) in 2011. Vakslen is the pure essence of hatred against collectivism and humanity, filled to the edge of political incorrectness, revolving around themes like oppressive religion, enslavement, modern degenerated morality and the sexualisation of society. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vakslen">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
