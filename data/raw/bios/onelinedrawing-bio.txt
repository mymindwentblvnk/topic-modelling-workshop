Jonah Matranga is a singer, songwriter and guitarist who has released a variety of solo material under both his own name and onelinedrawing, and has previously been part of the bands Far, New End Original (an anagram of "onelinedrawing") and Gratitude. Much of his solo material has also been self-published, though often subsequently distributed through labels such as Crank! and Corrupted Image. However, his two full-length onelinedrawing albums, Visitor (2002) and The Volunteers (2004) were released by Jade Tree Records. Matranga retired the onelinedrawing moniker in 2004, and he now intends to release all future solo releases under his name.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Onelinedrawing">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
