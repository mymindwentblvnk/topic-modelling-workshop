Freddie Dredd (born September 19, 1997) is a Canadian rapper and producer based in Oshawa, Ontario. He is originally from Durham, Ontario.

Many of his songs are produced by himself, under the name “Ryan C." Best known for blending gritty, lo-fi sounds, vintage samples, and intense—often dark—lyrics which often is similar to the style of $UICIDEBOY$, this genre would be considered to be labeled as Phonk, a subgenre of trap in which many of the sounds used in his tracks are reminiscent of the Memphis hip-hop mixtapes from the mid to late 90’s.

Despite this, Freddie’s albeit unique style started gaining traction in early 2019 after several of his songs became viral hits on the short-form mobile video app, TikTok.

In addition to his solo work, Freddie frequently collaborates with other underground hip-hop artists, such as Baker, RAMIREZ, and Slim Guerilla. He is also an active member of DoomshopRecords and SIXSET. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Freddie+Dredd">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
