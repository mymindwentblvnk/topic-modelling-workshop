Formed at the beginning of 2013, Royal Blood is a 2-piece band from Brighton, East Sussex, UK. Having known each other for years in different bands, Mike Kerr (Bassist/Vocalist) & Ben Thatcher (Drums) finally came together and went into the studio to record ‘Figure It Out’ – the first track that brought attention to the band. At the tail end of 2013, Royal Blood released ‘Out of The Black’, their debut single on Black Mammoth Records. 

The band released their debut album ''Royal Blood’' on 22 August, 2014 which sold 66,000 copies in its first week. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Royal+Blood">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
