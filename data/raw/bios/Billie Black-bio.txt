Billie Black is a 19 year old singer,songwriter from West London. She began singing at an early age after hearing reggae, soul and disco records at her motherâ€™s family parties-  a Mum who, it should be noted, was Sierra Leone's national disco dancing champion. At 13 Billie started to take music seriously, joining the National Youth Jazz Orchestra and starting a love affair with jazz that led all the way to a place on the Guildhall jazz degree. At 14 Billie went to the Brit School, where she was exposed to a wide variety of music and it was towards the end of her time there that she started listening artist such as James Blake, Jessie Ware, Sampha and emerging R&B crooner Kwabs; all acts who combine classic vocals with electronic production. These artists have had a big influence on the music Black is currently making.

From that point on Billie started writing her own music, putting together a band and working with producers Imposters & John Calvert on a sound that combined her roots in jazz with the bass and dance sounds of the moment. Anyone coming to her shows will hear songs that range from minimalist electronic ballads to RnB to all-out floor-fillers.
