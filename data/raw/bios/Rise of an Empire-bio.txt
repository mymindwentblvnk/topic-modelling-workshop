Description
In the short time that Bridgwaters Rise Of An Empire have been together, they've already begun to make a name for themselves. The band, comprising of Will Willcox (Vocals), Ellwood Newbon (Guitar), Joe Hurst (Bass), and John Hurst (Drums), came together with the same ambition. To make music that will change peoples minds on the current scene, to make something heavy yet enjoyable and fun. Something that shines through in every live performance they give relentlessly. Combining powerfull Death Metal with crushing breakdowns and slam riffs, they guarantee to play a show that will stick with you for a long time after, leaving you wanting more. Having already played with the likes of Martyr Defiled (A Siege Of Amida Records), Silent Screams (Ghost Music), Continents, amongst others, Rise Of An Empire are here to stay. And they're here to be heard. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rise+of+an+Empire">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
