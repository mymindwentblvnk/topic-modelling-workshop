Some music is created to bring light into a darkened world; the music of Risingfall simply exposes the shadows for what they really are. Drawing on musical influences both beautiful and terrible; Risingfall paints a brutally truthful portrait of the world around us. Walking a razors edge between old school Thrash and modern European metal, Risingfall combines a vicious twin axe attack with a thunderous rythym section to create an agressive hybrid of metal comparable to heavier, more technical Iron Maiden. Risingfall is quickly becoming a powerful and accessible new voice in the world of heavy metal.

Formed out of the chaotic Minneapolis music scene, singer / guitarist Dave Whitmer, bassist J.Adair, drummer Patrick Korwicki and guitarist Matt McNallie came together in the fall of 2005 to create the current lineup of Risingfall. Their shared musical vision manisfested quickly, and Risingfall was perfoming live within a few short months. By 2007, the band was attracting major attention and exposing more and more fans their unique brand of power / thrash metal.

Sonically, Risingfall begins where their influences end. From the very roots of heavy metal on through to the new milennium, Risingfall draws upon various influences and melds them into a cohesive whole. Remaining true to their roots without sounding derivative, and with an energetic and entertaining live show, Risingfall has sucessfully set themselves apart from the rest time and again.
