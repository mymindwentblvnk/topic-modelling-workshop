RIMAR’s sounds are a conglomeration of R&B, retro samples, and savvy beat music. Although most of his songs are pop dance tunes, they arise out of basement grit, evoking urban cinematic imagery, making them that much more intriguing. Young and ambitious, Rimar’s momentum is only getting started with Higher Ground, and he has just released a video for his single of the same title.

Check out his music here: http://rimar.bandcamp.com/ and cop the 12'' treatment of Higher Ground from Bella Union.
