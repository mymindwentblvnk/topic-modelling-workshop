Concrete Force is a very nice thrash metal band from Greece. They released a demo in 2008 called Mental Enforcers (this demo gives you the real feeling of the 80's). 
This demo has now (2010) been transformed into their debut album with the same name!  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Concrete+Force">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
