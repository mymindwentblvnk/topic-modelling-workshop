Denmark's Behind the Curtain create their own avant-garde vision of metal for the next millennium. Till Birth Do Us Part is a truly progressive metal album in every sense of the word Â­ from the opening thunderous powergroove riffs, the technical arrangements, to the silent melancholy portrayed in the closing track "I Believe, Part 2." Although complex in nature, Behind The Curtain's music is often subtle and filled with powerful emotions.

The European press has already compared the band to the late U.S. psych-metal band Psychotic Waltz. This radical style caught the attention of noted producer Jacob Hansen (Invocator, Without Grief, Aurora, Illdisposed, Iniquity, etc.) who agreed to produce their debut album.

Behind the Curtain's music continues to evolve, growing more complex but with enough melodies to appeal to everyone who likes great metal songs. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Behind+the+Curtain">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
