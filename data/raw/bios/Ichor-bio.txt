Ichor, a death metal band from Trier, Germany’s oldest city, was founded in April 2008 by members of other established local bands.

The band has already made appearances with a self-released EP (Kingdom Of The Dead) as well as a support-act for several famous and international metal-bands. A recent deal with Bastardized Recordings enables the band to release their debut-album ‘The Siege’ worldwide. All songs were recorded and mixed in February 2009 by Phil Hillen from the SU2-Studio, and mastered by Simon from War From A Harlots Mouth.

The Siege was realesed on june 19th 2009 all over europe.
