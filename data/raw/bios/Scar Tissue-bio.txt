Scar Tissue emerged from California's goth/industrial scene in 1990 and was alternately labeled "power electro", "tribal industrial" and other adjective combinations exposing them as not fitting into a particular sub-genre. They gained a loyal following for their broad stylistic scope as well as for their entertaining live shows which were drastically different from the "two guys twiddling knobs" phenomenon common in the electronic industrial genre. 

The band released three CDs on 21st Circuitry Records (distributed by Caroline Records) and appeared on numerous compilations throughout the 1990s. Most of Scar Tissue's live performances were in California, but they toured the United States three times: once as a headliner with opening band Luxt, and twice as the opening act for 16 Volt. When 21st Circuitry's assets were bought by Metropolis Records, the Scar Tissue CD inventory was trashed. Those original releases are now available only through used CD outlets (click here to view Amazon's Scar Tissue page) but fans can still access all the band's music by making a friendly request through this site.

In the first few years of the new century, Scar Tissue continued creating music under the name Form/Alkaline. A variety of CDRs were sold over the internet and at live shows, but there were no releases under this name on any record label. This material will be available as a Scar Tissue album titled "Form/alkaline" on eMusic, Amazon and Napster in March 2008, and on iTunes in April 2008.

Steve Watkins & Philip Caldwell, the primary Scar Tissue members, continue to write, record and perform individually, together, and with other projects.
