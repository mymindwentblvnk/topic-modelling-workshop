Sludge/Doom Metal from Portland. From Seventh Rule Blog:

"Seventh Rule welcomes Cascadian deathrock ensemble Atriarch to its stormy roster.

Hailing from Portland, OR, vocalist Lenny Smith describes Atriarch as â€œa living entity comprised of four parts, offering catharsis through sonic ritual where there is no god, there is no devil; there is an all encompassing force that connects all living things. Our aim is to tear a hole in the veil that blinds us from our true selves. We are bombarded with ideals of a superficial shallow lifestyle, that we are enslaved to maintain."

Comprised of members from Graves At Sea, Trees, Final Conflict, Uzala, and Get Hustle, Seventh Rule will release "Forever the End," the first full length by Atriarch, in the coming summer months. "Forever the End" was tracked in Portland with the help of William Holloway then mixed and mastered by Greg Wilkinson (Ludicra, Asunder, Saviors) at Earhammer Studios in Oakland, CA."
