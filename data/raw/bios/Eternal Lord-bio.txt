Eternal Lord was an English metalcore band, formed in 2005.

Eternal Lord formed from the remaining band members of The Hunt for Ida Wave. In 2006, the band released their self-titled EP through Thirty Days of Night Records, followed shortly by a split EP with Glasgow group Azriel. Shortly after the release of the split, vocalist Sam Ricketts decided to quit the band to pursue his dream of becoming a tattoo artist. A search for a replacement vocalist began and the band recruited Ivan Ferreira of The Hurt Process. Ferreira was unable to join the group permanently due to other commitments, and was soon replaced by former The Hunt for Ida Wave and I Killed The Prom Queen vocalist Edward Butcher.

Their debut album Blessed Be This Nightmare was released throughout the UK and Europe on the 17th of March 2008 via Golf Records and on the 18th March 2008 in the US via Ferret Music. While the group's early material was more death metal oriented, Blessed Be This Nightmare incorporates elements of thrash metal, progressive metal, death metal and metalcore. They were labelled as metalcore on their website but are considered by fans as deathcore.

In late May 2008 it was announced that drummer Stuart Mckay had abruptly quit the band just prior to them embarking on a US tour with The Acacia Strain, All Shall Perish and Since The Flood. In July 2008, Eddy Thrower was announced as the band's new drummer. Ed Butcher was thrown out towards the end of 2008, and bassist Nick Gardner left soon after. On January 6 2009 they finally announced Eternal Lord had broken up. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Eternal+Lord">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
