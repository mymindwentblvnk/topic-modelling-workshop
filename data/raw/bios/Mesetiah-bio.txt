Mesetiah was formed in the beginning of 2008. It didn´t take long before the band had found their own style and sound. "Headbang ´til you bleed", has been they motto since the beginning and they deliver it with aggressiveness, combined with killer riffs. One year had passed writing and rehearsing songs when Mesetiah took part in a band contest in May 2009 and won at their very first show! A few months later we saw band sharing the stage with Finland´s top artists at Kokkola Rock Festival! Not a bad start for these young headbangers. So, why stop now when the metal is melted. Mesetiah´s debut album "The Purpose of Our Existence" is released 31th of December 2009!
