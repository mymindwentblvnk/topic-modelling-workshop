Tattered Soul is a German black metal band formed in 2007. Until the end of 2010 their music was influenced by a slow Black/Death Metal. At the same time their drummer and guitarist left the band, but after a short period the line-up was completed again with two new gituarists and a new drummer. Together they developed their musical style into Thrash influenced Black Metal.
