Pale Sketcher is Justin Broadrick's 'electronica' side of Jesu.

It occurred to him during the writing Jesu's 'Opiate Sun' EP in early 2009, that Jesu, first and foremost, was intended to be a guitar oriented project. The 'electronica' side of Jesu was just an inevitable direction for him, but never satisfied with this battle between guitars and electronica with Jesu, he decided to separate the two directions - Jesu, now, and for the forseeable future, being guitar based exclusively, with Pale Sketcher being the project where he can focus and develop further, the Jesu 'electronica' sound, without need for further fusion or compromise. The first album was released in 2010.
