These Trails was a psychedelic folk group from Honolulu, Hawaii, United States, founded in 1973.
Formed by  Margaret Morgan, Dave Choy, Carlos Pardeiro and Patrick Cockett, they released their one and only album on Honolulu’s Synergia label in 1973 in a limited private pressing.
Tablas, guitars, flutes, synthesizers, sitars and multiple interwoven vocal tracks coalesce into shimmering lysergic lullabies and ethereal ballads with an eastern raga feel. Vocalist Margaret Morgan’s vibrato is gorgeous and with the addition of studio-enhanced modulation becomes Blue Jay Way trippy. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/These+Trails">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
