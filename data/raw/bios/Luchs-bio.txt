Patrik Berg Almkvisth is a musician and actor better known as the producer, LUCHS. Born into a musical family, one of his earliest memories is falling asleep every Sunday under the grand piano his father was playing in church. Throughout his childhood, Patrik was surrounded by music and this interest continued to thrive throughout school as he began studying music full time.   After withdrawing from the Royal College of Music, Stockholm, he continued his education within the arts by studying theatre at Calle Flygare Theatre School, Stockholm University and Linnaeus University, subsequently beginning a split career of acting and music production. He has performed on stage, TV and the big screen - from productions at The Royal Swedish Opera and Royal Dramatic Theatre, to voice acting roles for Marvel, Disney, Blue Sky Studios and Netflix. This has created a deep understanding of storytelling, something that is also audible in his music.   "Consuming other art and observing my environment is a crucial part of the creative process. But it's in the silence I find the most fertile soil for my own creativity to bloom."   In the beginning of 2020 he released his first full length album Solskur. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Luchs">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
