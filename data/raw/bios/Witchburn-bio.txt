There are two bands using the name Witchburn:

1. Seattle, USA
Witchburn delivers passionate, moody southern metal, made even more powerful by the band's fierce energy and considerable musical chops. The smoky grooves are deep and heavy, tapping into a classic rock vein with gritty, interweaving guitar lines, seamlessly blending vintage rock influence with that of modern metal.

Their ready-for-battle anthems, apocalyptic overtones and dirty, doom-laden riffs keep your ears glued while confirming that these are dedicated musicians with genuine love for all that is heavy. Singer Jamie Nova is also well known for her role as lead vocalist in the all female AC/DC tribute band Hell's Belles, in which she portrays Bon Scott and Brian Johnson with her surprisingly expressive vocal range. Seeing what else this band is capable of becomes even more attractive when the black-dreadlocked guitarist trades her Les Paul for a violin on a song or two. Their monster riffs, powerful vocals and kick ass, shout-along choruses completely galvanize even the most skeptical listeners, sending them promptly into blissful abandon as they surrender to pumping their fists in the air.

Pouring their whole hearts into their own bluesy brand of sultry Sabbath sludge, Witchburn commands you to throw your metal horns up high!
