Scruple - Horrormetal from Germany

This is a international band project of solo-guitar-player
Sved Joergenson and Zombie (vocals). Scruple felt dedicated
to horror themes in often obscure german phrases (such as
the well-known "shclangelndes gewurm") from the beginning.
They want to tell absurd horror tales in a neck-crushing 
old school metal way and "sing with a high voice".
