Hailing from Eerie, PA, Village of Dead Roads is comprised of Doug Corey (lead guitar and vocals), Eric Abt (rhythm guitar), and Chris Williams (drums). Their eclectic sonic recipe combines the doom of Black Sabbath with the ambient progressive metal of Isis, the industrial grind of Godflesh, and additional traces of hardcore. First captured in 2005 on a split release with Meteor City label mates Spiritu entitled Human Failures, the band's unconventional vision resulted in a full-length debut, Dwelling in Doubt, the following year.
