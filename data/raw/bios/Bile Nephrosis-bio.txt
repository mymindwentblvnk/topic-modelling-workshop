Bile Nephrosis was formed in 2005 when the paths of Baron Ulrich Vandenkraut and Dr. Norman Galt crossed at an underground chemical waste dumping contest. It was during the semi-final round that the true spirit and form of Bile Nephrosis would be recognized. As the two young men furiously hurled their 55 gallon drums of industrial waste into the pristine forest of Yellowstone National Park, the sound of foliage and wildlife liquefying into ooze was enough to inspire the pair of the coming sound.

Month after month, they worked day and night to craft a sound that was reminiscent of the horrific, awe-inspiring chemical apocalypse. In 2005, the much anticipated EP Defecating on the Body of a Gutted Harlot was recorded. Uppers, downers, and a collection of under the sink cleaning products were all that our champions required in order to blast off in a drug infused frenzy of blind devotion to death metal.

During a cool autumn night in 2006, our young heroes of the sludge met another acolyte of sickening brutality; Sir Robert Burnette. This putrid young man was in the midst of one of the worst methamphetamine benders that humanity has ever witnessed - humanity in the sense of every filthy, scum filled, and vile puss head abomination stitched together by the threads of their own semen-soaked smegma-laden existence.

In order to christen the union of this unholy trio, a ritual sacrifice of a beautifully and innocently young nine year old boy was made. This obscene practice sealed the partnership of Bile Nephrosis.

In May of 2007, Bile Nephrosis appeared on the Goreism 5-way split from Cephalic Records. Following minor setbacks, Bile Nephrosis released their new CD "Capital" on 10/21/07. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bile+Nephrosis">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
