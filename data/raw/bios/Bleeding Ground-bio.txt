Bleeding Ground are hard hitting with a blend of brutal and melodic riffs to tingle your ear drums.

They have just Released a 3 track EP/Demo titled 'Destroy My Fears' and have been working the local scene. With former members of 'Silence Dies/We Die At Dawn' and 'Demonbreed' they are a band not to be missed. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bleeding+Ground">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
