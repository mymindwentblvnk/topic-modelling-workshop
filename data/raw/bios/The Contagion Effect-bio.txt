The Contagion Effect was formed by Ex Whisteria Cottage. In April 2011 we decided that we wanted to start playing again and we felt like we wanted to start it fresh. After some member changes we felt like it was the best thing to do. Our writing has matured from our previous band in numerous ways. We know everyone will enjoy the direction we are going and cant wait to see what happens.

We are aiming for an EP out later this year! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Contagion+Effect">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
