Bowel Stew is an Italian goregrind/brutal death metal band which formed in 1996. They were formerly known as Monolith and are on Rottenpyosis Records. A particularly notable trait of the band is the sound of the vocals; they're pitchshifted to sound almost like an intestinal tract digesting food. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bowel+Stew">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
