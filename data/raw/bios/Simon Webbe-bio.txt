Simon Solomon Webbe (born 30th March 1979, in Manchester, England) is a member of the English boy band Blue, and also released music as a solo artist with 'a sweet soulful sound reminiscent of The Lighthouse Family'.

His first single, "Lay Your Hands", was released on 22nd August 2005, and reached #4 on the UK Singles Chart. His second, "No Worries" also reached #4 in November. Right after the release of his second single, the debut album, "Sanctuary", was released. Despite its #28 debut on the UK album charts, the album began to climb in its later weeks. On March 13, 2006, nearly 4 months after its release, the album went to #7 in the official charts making its second appearance in the top 10. The third single released from Simon's album, "After All This Time", was released in February and failed to become Simon's third consecutive solo Top 10 hit, entering at #16, falling to #29 in its second week, and continually dropping from there.

Simon has a 9 year old daughter from a previous relationship with Nicola Jones when he was 17 years old.
