“Decrresscenddo” is the work of Boron, a one-member group new to Portland that explores the mind-numbing waveforms of analog synths and modular synths. Recorded mostly on a modular Moog III-P that’s the size of a room—and one of only 4 operating in the world—Boron’s sonic glacier passes through one ear and out the other, wiping clean all impure thoughts. Boron’s member includes Dan Nelson, drummer, conceptual artist, and creator of the award-winning book “All Known Metal Bands”.

Boron is also a Czech metal band <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Boron">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
