Ingenium is a technical jazz metal band formed in 2001 in Tarn√≥w, Poland.
After finishing first promo album - Inhale My Silence in late 2002 band were splited.
In early 2004 band were reformed, and released a brand new EP titled We Sleep in Cocoons. One year after band finished and released - as a demo in 2006 - a longplay titled 2nd Sun in the Eclipse, that contains various music styles from technical death metal through jazz to crust and stoner metal. After several months of fruitless searching, the band decided to release studio album for free on the Jamendo.com site (tracks still needs to be re-tagged), and then splited again in late 2009.
The album was re-released by a small independent .rec music label, that made it available for free in 2011.
