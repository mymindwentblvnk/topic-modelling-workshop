The band Autumn Rain Melancholy formed in August 2000. Originally it included Paul , Rain and Gour . Then the musicians met young Mist and offered him to play together. The appearance of keyboards gave the music absolutely different, gothic, atmospheric sound. The music became more melodic and musicians kept on developing in that direction. 

The appearance of lyrics led to the appearance of Natalie (vocals). By such a staff the band prepared material for NIGHT FOREVER. The album was distinguished by melancholic romanticism. Before the beginning of recording Natalie left the band, her place took Helen. Originally the album presented instrumental demo-version, vocal parts were absent. The recording lasted for about a year. 
After the completion promo-discs were sent to labels and magazines of metal music. The thirst review appeared in the magazine DARK CITY, marked the album as the "four-star" one (by the "five-star" scale) that strengthened musician's hopes. Then Helen and Gour left the bandâ€¦ The staff of 3 men went on rehearsing and started to create material for the new album (the preliminary name was WHEN ANGELS DIE). The place of bass-guitarist was taken by Horst (guitarist of SIMARGL), but a month later Twilight replaced him. In Autumn 2002 vocalist Ilia was invited. At that period of time the music acquired some elements of melodic black metal style. Afterwards Iren (vocals) and Wind (second guitar) joined the band. That staff completed the work at the second album and the musicians set to recording. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Autumn+Rain+Melancholy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
