Cain's Dinasty borns in Summer'06. From the beginning the band had a vocation for certain vampiric look and a dark thematic in its songs, which will be evolving to become a recognizable and personal charasteristic of the band..

Between the biggest achievements of the band we can emphasize having shared stage with bands consecrated like Coz, Gamma Ray, Metallium, Warcry, Azrael, etc. having played for more than 2000 people in some of these concerts, and receiving good critics by the energy of its live performances.

At the moment the band has published 2 discs, both distributed internationally; first "Legacy of Blood" was edited in June 2008 by the French seal "Melodica Records" who at the same time would sign an agreement with the company Spiritual Beast Records to distribute the album in Japan, Hong Kong, China, Korea, and Taiwan. The disc in addition is displayed in French festival Hellfest, and the band has some appearances in radio programs and specialized press like BURNN in Japan, Metal Hammer in Spain and METAL OBS in France. This one was indeed the disc that would take the band to tour outside our borders, crossing France during 10 days, playing in the main cities along with the popular French band "Black Rain".

Second disc, "Madmen, Withes & Vampires" was realeased in all the world in December 2010 under the japanese label Red Rivet Records.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cain%27s+Dinasty">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
