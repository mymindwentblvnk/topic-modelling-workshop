Necryptic is a four-piece progressive death metal band from Eugene, OR. Since emerging from the underworld in December 2004, they have been making a name for themselves with their brutal, no-holds-barred musical style and extensive self-promotion. With intricate rhythms, searing solos, and quick changes, their music stays focused and to-the-point. Necryptics machine-like precision and complex, technical interpretation of extreme music will instantly grab the attention of even the harshest of critics. They are constant. They are destructive to the senses, unrelenting, dark and confronting. Demonic vocals fill your head with low guttural growls and intense screams, definitely not the kind of music for a peace, love and nature type of event. Merciless unwavering brutality crunches through your bones with visceral force. Fast, unpredictable guitar patterns and dynamic, widely varied song structure help give Necryptic a unique sound, unmatched by other death-metal acts. This highly refined sound along with intense high-energy stage performances has earned them respect in the local scene up and down the West coast. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Necryptic">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
