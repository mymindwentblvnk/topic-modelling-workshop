Chaosium was founded by Igor Miladinovic (guitar) and Ivan Petrovic (bass), both members of heavy/thrash metal band Alister, in August 2014. At first, it was just a side project, but soon two other guys joined Chaosium, Ivan Dulic (drums) and Nikola Pavicevic (guitar), making it more than just a project. The band is currently working on their new songs.
