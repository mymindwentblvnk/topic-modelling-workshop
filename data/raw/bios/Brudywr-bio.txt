The Brudywr was formed in 2005 as a solo project of Stanislav ‘Brudywr’ Ambartsumov in Irkutsk, Russia who previously took part in several local rock/metal acts since 1995.

Stanislav started as a guitar player in Angarsk (a town nearby Irkutsk) rock band “Wind rose” in 1995 and later he mastered all kinds of typical rock band instruments from drums to synthesizers. He also used to play death-meta
l in "Barracuda" act from 1999 till 2000 and old-school black metal in his black-metal act “Morgana” from 2000 till 2004.
Those days his own style was influenced by such performers as Black Sabbath, Death, Obituary, Darkthrone, Bathory.

By the middle of 2000s Brudywr got his inspiration mainly from cold Siberian weather and rigorous nature that led him to slower and more doom-like stuff like Burzum, Xasthur, Tiamat, Samael.

In 2004 Brudywr decided to disband "Morgana" and perform alone by his own title until there are good musicians enough ready to cooperate. After several years of composing songs and polishing stuff several albums have been released on jamendo.org under the Brudywr title.
