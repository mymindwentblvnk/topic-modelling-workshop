"my sister grenadine" is the acoustic side of the Berlin based musician Vincenz Kokot, who also is the singer and guitarist of the critically acclaimed postrockers polaroid liquide. 

He started to write these atmospheric songs for & about & with his imaginary sister in summer 07 and began playing support shows for international acts as well as an acoustic tour through germany. 

In 2008 his debut CD named “Shine in the Dark” was released via Solaris Empire and was well perceived by the german press & audience. A minimal album that features ukulele, driving blues guitar and finger picking songs that sound like fragile snapshots and tell you stories about the secrets within matchboxes.

During 2008 tours throughout Germany & Switzerland followed as well as festival shows & concerts in France & Poland. At the moment Grenadine & Vincenz are working on new material and look forward to the springtime.
