Joe Stump is an American guitarist and composer. His style is similar to Yngwie Malmsteen's neo-classical metal. He released albums with his band, Reign of Terror and also as a solo artist. Stump is a professional shredder, and Guitar One Magazine voted him 6th position among the Top 10 fastest shredders of all time. Joe has taught for many years at the Berklee College of Music in Boston.

He also has a guitar instructional DVD lisenced under Berklee Music.

Stump endorses and uses ESP Guitars, Marshall amplifiers and Rhino amplifiers.

Although it is an ESP, his guitar is smilar to Yngwie's Signature Fender Stratocaster not just in its outlook but also in its technical specialities. (for example; Its fingerboard is scalloped like Yngwie)
