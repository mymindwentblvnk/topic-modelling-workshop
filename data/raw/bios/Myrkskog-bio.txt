Myrkskog is a Black / Death Metal band (formed in 1993) from Drammen, Norway.

Usually their music consists of thunderous high speed doublebass with remarkably rapid blastbeats and fills. Guitars are made up of harmonic tremolo picking and sometimes powerchords with fast solos composed by Destructhor who, along with Secthdamon, currently plays in Zyklon. Their debut album Deathmachine is a hybrid blackened death metal album combining attributes of both genres, their second album Superior Massacre is much more death metal oriented with much more prominent basslines and less tremelo picked riffs. Myrkskog have been largely dormant since the release of Superior Massacre but make occasional live appearances, the most recent of which was at the 2006 edition of the Inferno Festival.
