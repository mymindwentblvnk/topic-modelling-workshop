Formed in 2010 by Rich Tufts II and Ryan Bender as a studio project, and over time we evolved into a full 4 piece band. After going through various lineup changes, lost song compositions/ unreleased/ lost demos, we solidified our current lineup and have Re- written and released a full length album of what we feel is solid material. We strive to constantly create and evolve as human beings and musicians, Always trying to extend the boundaries of what we think our limitations are... Our current form includes:

Robert Ginn • Drums
