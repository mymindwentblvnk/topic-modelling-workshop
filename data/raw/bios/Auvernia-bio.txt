Auvernia is a metal band hailing from Argentina. Born in 1999 as a just-for-fun project, it took almost 7 years and several line-up changes to build the foundations that would result in their first production in 2006, a four track EP entitled “You Will Come”. Although it was a low budget demo, it left no doubt that this wasn’t a just-for-fun project anymore; it managed to become something unique in the underground metal scene of Buenos Aires.

Two years later, in 2008, the band released its first full length album entitled “Towards Eternity”. Good reviews were to come, and not just from homeland. The album crossed the barriers of territory to find listeners all over the world, surpassing all possible expectations.

But time doesn’t stop and neither does Auvernia. After years of its creative voice and only one album produced, the band was eager to continue composing. Inevitably a new album was in the making.

The band kept combining styles and influences including power metal, black metal, heavy, progressive, latin and classical music in the pursuit of an identity of their own, a challenging feat nowadays. That makes it hard to fit Auvernia into one category. Although the first album was Power Metal driven, the band continued to grow creatively, leading to their second release in 2010, a 12 piece LP entitled “Afraid of Me”. In just one year this new album was composed and recorded, a process that had previously taken nine years.

Unfortunately it ain't all about music, due to the always difficult issue of maintaining creative harmony, the band currently consists of the founding members; Fernando H. Varela (Vocals, Guitars) and Juan P. Verni (Drums). Which presents no trouble for Auvernia to carry on since they have been the core of the band from the beginning. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Auvernia">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
