About Both Legs Broken  (Canada)
Hailing from all 4 corners of Winnipeg MB, Both Legs Broken. Consisting of Chris(drums), JP(guitar), Sheldon(guitar), Kristjan(bass) and Veronica(vocals). Both Legs Broken will bleed into your senses causing mindrot and perceptual distortion. Writing started in 2006 with JP and Chris. Not knowing what was in store for the future...Kristjan joined, making a trio. Only to have to find the right vocalist. BANG! Veronica came to the mix filling the sound out perfectly. Now gathered together from all over with metal in common, it was time to write the tunes.
"With songs like 'Rabid Street Preacher' and 'Slamthrash' we feel there will be no end to the amount of audio and visual torture we will inflict. This is absolutely the funnest and hardest band I've ever been part of!!!" says Chris(drummer).
As Both Legs Broken move along with songwriting, it only gets more diverse. "Why stay with one style when your band is more than capable of exploring all possibilities of intensity" says Kristjan(bass). As 2009 ascends, Both Legs Broken will comeout double fisted with arms swinging.
"2009 is our year! Look out!" says JP(guitar) Pay close attention...Both Legs Broken will have you screaming and fighting and...you get it!
