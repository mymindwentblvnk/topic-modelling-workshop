Thalarion is a progressive death doom metal band from Topolcany, Slovakia. Its members gather in about 1990 in the Bastard band which records two demo tapes in '91 and '93 (Black Raven and Best Art correspondingly). 

Juraj Grezdo joins the band after splitting up with Nailed Nazarene. The name Bastard is changed to Fatal Infection and by the end of 1994 the demo Behind the Doors of Sorrow is recorded. 

The old name doesn't fit the new material, so it's changed into Thalarion meaning the ancient city of mad poets and flying demons (see Lovecraft's story A White Ship). In March 1996 the first album Towards the Obscure Slumberland is released  through  Hallelujjah Prod.. 

The MCD Dominium Unfold (1996) for the US label Wild Rags Records has never been released. 

Nevertheless in December 1998 the second album is released through Mighty Music. The Tales Of The Woods... Thus Was Written album is well received by the world metal scene.
 
Their third album Four Elements Mysterium is marked with 1998 Nela Horvathova's vocals. Nela has also done backing vocals on Tales Of The Woods... Thus was Written.
 
In November 2002 Mighty Music releases the fourth Thalarion album Tunes of Despondency. After the more gothic Four Elements Mysterium the band changes to a faster and more agressive music going closer to their debut album Towards the Obscure Slumberland. 

In 2004 the fifth album Hellium is released. Now there are no keyboards or female vocals (Nela Horvathova is  now in Disanchely). The new member Michal (guitar) joins the band and takes a great part in writing material.
