NIEDERFLUR: minimal techno duo Christopher Bleckmann & Hannes Wenner from Cologne, also known as Sender-Records' main act MISC. With their nd-releases on Richie Hawtin's M-NUS imprint they came up in 2001 with a very different kind of minimal techno, a very special mixture of minimalsitic rhythm structures based on slow four-to-the-floor beats and basslines.
