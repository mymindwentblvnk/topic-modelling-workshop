Langtry is the project of guitarist Patrick McKinney. Around the same time he was playing with Sam Beam in Iron & Wine (either alongside or as an opening act), he cut a solo CD of acoustic Americana influenced instrumentals to great reviews. He has since expanded that into an ever evolving full band. Elements of the acoustic Americana were augmented with distorted guitars, violin, and stand up bass; and drums.
