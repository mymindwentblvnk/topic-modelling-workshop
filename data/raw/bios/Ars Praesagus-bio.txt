Ars, formerly and/or also known Ars Praesagus is a blackened death metal from Finland. Since it's formation in in 2007, Ars has practiced a chaotic mixture of black metal and death metal which can be only described as hell metal.

Their first demo EP, curiously named Inhale Satan was released on May 31, 2007 which divided critics' and listeners' opinions into two opposites. Ars are currently working on their first full length album to be entitled Helluciferination, which is to be released some time in the future.
