Formed in Modena (Italy) the band started to write songs and perform live locally. After the first demo was released some line-up changes took place, which leads us to the current line-up. They recorded their debut album “Enlighten” and changed their name to Sleeping Romance, and after that a deal was inked with the Swedish label Ulterium Records.
Federico Truzzi recorded “Enlighten” at the Lemonhead Studio and then the album was mastered by Roberto Priori [Los Angeles, Danger Zone, Vision Divine] at Pristudio. The incredible artwork was created by Felipe Machado Franco [Blind Guardian, Rhapsody of Fire] who really managed to capture the vibe of the album.
The band describes the concept for “Enlighten” as “a travel into the human soul who is crashing into the world: fighting, loving and to be born again”.
In December 2014 they release a new digital single: Fire&Ice. The digital single includes two additional tracks: a “cinematic version” of “Fire & Ice” as well as a re-recorded version of “December Flower”.
