Trigger Effect are a bunch of jerks from Montreal who play some loud, obnoxious music. They like to travel around from city to city in a big, smelly van and get out ever so often to yell at people. They have made some musical discs including Dare to Ride the Heliocraft and Friendship Adventure Music, Versitis Maximus and Escape From Planet Scorpion. They have made parties with a bunch of cool bands all over North America and Europe. They will probably come near you at some point in the future, so when they do you should go to see them and say hello. Maybe they will be nice to you, maybe not, but they are very good at having fun.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Trigger+Effect">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
