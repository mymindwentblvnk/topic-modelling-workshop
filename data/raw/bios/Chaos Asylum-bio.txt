There are 2 bands with this name:

1) "Holland has a history of fighting. Fighting the Spanish, fighting water, fighting the English on the water. And a history of windmills. No wonder that the Dutchies of Chaos Asylum play a brand of Thrash Metal you can bang your head to. Especially considering that they’re from Alkmaar, where Holland’s victory against the Spanish started. To put it shortly: it’s only natural that Chaos Asylum is the embodiment of Polderthrash. 

Guitarist Alex Mulder and singer Kevin Pasman formed Chaos Asylum after the demise of their former band Anubis. They soon teamed up with René Vlaar, who also played drums for Jör-qz and still does for Semper Mortis, and former Anubis bass player Rob Langendijk to jam on some brand new Thrash songs. Langendijk soon left the band to pursue other musical interests and was replaced by former Dystopia singer/guitarist Dennis Onsia. After a long search, Rick Jongman completed the lineup as the second guitarist and Chaos Asylum prepared for the stage. 

The criteria for Chaos Asylum’s music are quite simple. If the guys like it, they’ll play it. The result is a high energy, full speed ahead type of Thrash Metal which is firmly rooted in the American tradition of the mid eighties, but also open to fresh influences. And with ages ranging from 18 to 30, the band has the experience as well as the youthful enthusiasm they need. 

Rest assured, Chaos Asylum is ready to kick your ass. With wooden shoes, if necessary."
