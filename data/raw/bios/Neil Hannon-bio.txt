Neil Hannon (born November 7, 1970) is a singer and songwriter, best known as the creator and lead member of the orchestral pop group The Divine Comedy. The band's official website even goes so far as to say, "The Divine Comedy is Neil Hannon," and Hannon is quoted in an interview as saying, "The Divine Comedy will always be my band because... I thought of it first!"

In 2005 he contributed vocals to his long-time collaborator Joby Talbot's soundtrack for the movie version of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

Neil has also contributed to the soundtrack to Doctor Who, providing two tracks; both of them for (new) Series 2. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Neil+Hannon">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
