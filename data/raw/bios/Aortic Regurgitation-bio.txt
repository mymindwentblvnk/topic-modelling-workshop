Based in Hong Kong, Aortic Regurgitation was formed in late 2008 as a response to the lack of thrash metal in the local metal scene. Their 5 track EP was released independently in early 2010, since made available for free download (see below!!). 

Aortic Regurgitation are Cynthia Yim (Vocals, Guitar, Drum Programming) and Charles Wong (Guitar, Bass, Drum Programming).
