California technical death metal collective, WRATH OF VESUVIUS, now more commonly known as WRVTH, recently joined forces with extreme metal powerhouse, Unique Leader Records, for the release of their third full-length this Spring.

Established in 2007, WRVTH self-financed their 2009 A World In Peril EP followed by their 2010 debut long player Portals Through Ophiuchus before piquing the interest of Mediaskare Records who released sophomore rager, Revelation, in 2013. Following two years of maniacal tour schedules, personnel shifts, and a wholly matured approach to their sound, WRATH OF VESUVIUS will drop their self-titled third offering this Spring.

Comments the band of their union with Unique Leader, “We are beyond excited to be working with Unique Leader Records. They have always had cutting edge heavy bands that stand out among the modern metal scene. They’re a solid label which means a lot these days, and we couldn’t have asked for a better partner in taking our next step. We took a fresh approach to writing this record and its really starting to come together. This band has changed a lot over the last few years, and we think this record will display the distinctive character and eclectic personality that we bring to each song.”
