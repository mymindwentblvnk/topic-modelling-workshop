tricot is a math rock band from Kyoto, Japan created in 2010 by four talented musicians: Ikkyu Nakajima (vocals, guitar), Motoko "Motifour" Kida (guitar, vocals), Hiromi "Hirohiro" Sagane (bass, vocals) and Yuusuke Yoshida (drums). Previous drummer Kazutaka Komaki left in 2014 but they have had replacement live drummers including Yuumi of FLiP and Yamaguchi Miyoko of detroit7 and BimBamBoom.

The band has developed a unique mix of elements using their fragile but dynamic vocal styles combined with thrilling, unpredictable and addictive song transitions as they explore dreamy post-rock-esque melodies and the complex rhythms similar to math rock.

In 2012 and 2013, due to the well recieved singles, EPs and mini-album releases, they performed at several major festivals across Japan such as ARABAKI ROCK FEST, FUJI ROCK FESTIVAL, ROCK IN JAPAN, RISING SUN ROCK FESTIVAL, MONSTER BASH, WILD BUNCH FEST, SWEET LOVE SHOWER and more.

Not long after this was the arrival of tricot's debut full-length album "T H E" which followed another long and successful support tour, leading into the 2014 year with appearances around 5 countries during the “What’s Ochansensu-Su!? tricot Asia Tour”.

That same year the band appeared at four large festivals in Europe and show no signs of slowing down their rapidly expanding career.

The band's name is sometimes stylized as: トリコ (toriko)
