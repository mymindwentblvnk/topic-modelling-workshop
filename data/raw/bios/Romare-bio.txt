Romare is the alias of electronic producer and DJ Archie Fairhurst. Romare began mixing his own music with samples from second hand records after picking up a pair of turntables. Having studied African American Visual Culture at University. Romare Bearden's cut'n'paste artworks inspired Fairhurt to apply a similar technique to music. "I liked the way Bearden created original, aesthetically appealing work through a mixture of his own drawing and painting, with existing media, like cut-outs of old photographs or record sleeves,” Archie says. “Where he used collage, I use sampling.” <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Romare">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
