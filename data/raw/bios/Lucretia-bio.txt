There are 3 artists that record under the name Lucretia. A Dutch soul singer, a Jakarta-based thrash metal band, and a Connecticut metalcore band.

1. Lucretia is a Dutch singer. The genres she records in are pop, soul, R&B and theatrical. She started her carreer in the 90's and has gone on to record 4 albums (Lucretia, Alles Wat Telt, Altijd Over Liefde & Soul Cabaret), participated in the National finals of the Eurovision song contest, played in movies & tv shows and sold out theatres with her own shows & Big Black & Beautiful: a group she forms with fellow soul divas Rocq-E Harrell & Michelle David. 

2. LUCRETIA, one of the thrash metal band from Jakarta. Formed on June 2009, by Nino and Indro long time mates from college. Started covering oldschool thrash metal music like Megadeth, Anthrax, Testament and Cacophony. Released an EP in 2010 contains Queen of Sorrow’ first epic single, ‘Revolusi’, ‘Hitam’ a song about riot in May 1998. With dynamic harmony riffs and solos and always use an instrumental piece as opening, Lucretia is known as a guitar band. It’s not a surprise since Nino was a ‘guitar performer of the year 94’ at Tenda Mangkal, something that brings him a contract with the radio in Jakarta for any promotional road show held by that radio and Oki spent his summer learning a few lead picking tricks from Paul Gilbert himself. Combined with young powerful drummer Imam Ikhsan, Lucretia formulate a new breathe of ambience in thrash metal music. Now with a new female bassist Pima Aditya, Lucretia is ready to conquer the underground music scene with lethal and meaner material. 

3. Metalcore band from the Rust Belt section of Connecticut, formed in 2010, went on hiatus in 2013, regrouped in 2015 and been going strong since.
