We are first and foremost a ministry. The Father has given us the gift and the ability to play music. This is our way to give thanks. This is our way of worship. The stage is our battleground. We come in the name of the Most High to spread the Word of our Savior.  Behold The Kingdom has been playing shows since early 2009. They bring a spirit filled message of the love of Jesus Christ, along with a brutal sound to every show. Although the line-up has changed, the mission has not. We do what we do because we have a Great King who has called us to spread His name to the world. Drawing influences from death core, death metal and thrash, Behold the Kingdom aims to bring a mix of these genres. We all have a heart for people and would love to help out those seeking answers about their faith, scriptural references, and who the Father has called them to be. Please feel free to ask any questions at all! We love each and every one of you who come across our page. May Yahweh, Our King, bless you all.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Behold+The+Kingdom">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
