Daniel Francis Hawkins (born 12 December 1976 in Lowestoft, Suffolk, England) was the guitarist and backing singer of the UK band, The Darkness and now plays lead guitar for their successor band Stone Gods. His brother Justin Hawkins was the lead singer and also a guitarist in The Darkness, before leaving the band.

Dan is the less flamboyant Hawkins brother and is less verbal. He had decent examination grades gained at school in Lowestoft, and had started several bands. Unlike his brother, he does not have any tattoos or piercings. He is an avid follower of Thin Lizzy, wearing their shirts at nearly every concert and public appearance.

When Dan was in The Darkness he nearly always played a Gibson Les Paul guitar, and owns at least six of them, including a Les Paul Custom "Black Beauty" that was previously owned by Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin, (although a Gretsch often made an appearance, particularly when playing Black Shuck). His guitars are put through an Ibanez Tube Screamer TS-808 Distortion pedal (for solos) and a Line 6 DL4 Delay Modeler. The ensuing signal is then fed into six Marshall L100 heads and six Marshall 1960 vintage cabinets.

For playing live with Stone Gods he uses at least six Gibson Les Paul guitars going into 2 Marshall Plexi Heads (1 is a backup), a Marshall JCM 800 and a Diezel Herbert with Marshall 1960 Vintage Cabinets. All his effects are Rack Mounted and are controlled by a MIDI Footswitch and they include Line 6 Echo Pro, Ibanez Tube Screamer, Dunlop Cry Baby Wah-Wah and Digitech WH-1 Whammy. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dan+Hawkins">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
