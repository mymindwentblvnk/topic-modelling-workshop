The history of ArchiTorture dates back in 2005 when Anssi Kantola decided to form a band that would play Thrash Metal the way it should be played: fast, dangerous & lethal. The band was first know as 'Treachery', under which name it released two demos, 'Tomb of Mankind' and 'Skeleton Transformer', both in 2008. At the end of same year the band changed it's name to ArchiTorture. In 2009 ArchiTorture began more frequent gigging and released a 5-song EP 'Thrashing Through Your Mind'.

After numerous gigs, ArchiTorture have had the honour to open up for such bands as Holy Moses, Necrodeath, Witheria and Lie in Ruins as well as some of the greatest demo bands in Southern Finland.

ArchiTorture has now released 'Circle of Aggression' -promo, which comprises of three riff based, old school, gut-ripping Thrash Metal songs played at neck-break speed, recorded & mixed by ourselves. All these 3 songs are from upcoming full length album, for which we are searching for a record deal. If these songs don't make you bang your head, then we will bang it!  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Architorture">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
