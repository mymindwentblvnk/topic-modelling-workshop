Luca Sapio is from Italy.

He is the missing link between the italian sound libraries from the 70’s and the classic soul blues from the 60’s.

Luca knows that “You can’t sing the blues unless you have lived the blues” cause he is no stranger to hard times.

He spent his childhood fighting against an aggressive spinal desease that he beat. Luca also knows how much it hurts to carry the load of discomfort of being a stranger in a strange land, cause he spent part of his life in singing, working and travelling cross the countries in the old and the new world.

Thanks to his talent he has collaborated with many famous artists of different genres, from jazz to rhythm and blues as Tony Scott, Eumir Deodato, David Bianco, Andrea Morricone, Don Moye, Juliette Lewis.  His solo debut “Who Knows” was produced and arranged by Thomas Brenneck in New York.  The album won many awards as best debut of the year and reached the Italian and German Charts. The single “How Did We Lose It” was the i-Tunes single of the week and has a special mention in the CBS’s Live on Letterman.

Soon Luca began bringing his recognizable sound cross over the European countries sharing  the stage with artists as Paul Weller, Trombone Shorty, Sharon Jones, Lady and appeared as “special guest star” in TV shows as the famous german one “Die Harald Schmidt”.

In winter 2014 Luca worked with his band “The Dark Shadows” guided once more by Thomas Brenneck on his new album called “Everyday is gonna be the day”.  Album was recorded in full analog sound at the Diamond Mine Studios in New York.
