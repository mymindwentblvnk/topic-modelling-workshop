Villz has been quietly making a name for himself as the next alt-R&B vocalist to pay attention to. With his focus rooted in lost love, the moody, melodic music of Villz is driven by pensive confessions, sexual innuendos, and notions of escapism. While relying on heartbreak as his muse, the Haitian, Florida-bred singer/songwriter weaves soul, synth, and electric guitar with addictive downbeats and an unadulterated delivery. After captivating his audience with the standout singles “4:20 AM” and “Appreciation”, Villz finally releases his long-awaited 8 track debut album in full, which includes production from the likes of Mike Ewing, Sage Tune, William Wolf, Ducko McFli and Syksense. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/villz">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
