Doro Pesch (real name: Dorothea Pesch, born 3 June 1964, Düsseldorf, NRW) is a female vocalist, formerly of the German heavy metal band Warlock and one of the few female singers of the 1980s heavy metal scene.

Dorothee Pesch was born in Düsseldorf, West Germany on 3 June 1964, as the only child of Walter, a truck driver, and Barbara Pesch. Doro's first memory of rock music is the song "Lucille" by Little Richard, which she sang when she was three years old. She learned to play piano and started singing at the age of ten years, when she was exposed to the glam rock of bands like T. Rex, The Sweet and Slade. In 1980, she was accepted in her first band called Snakebite, which was playing rock music in a Düsseldorf basement used as rehearsal space by many other underground groups. The first recording with Doro on vocals was a cheap 7-track demo released by Snakebite for promotion. When Snakebite disbanded in 1981, Doro went on to sing for the garage bands Beast and Attack, before forming Warlock with Peter Szigeti, Rudy Graf, Thomas Studier, and Michael Eurich in 1982

After Warlock underwent many personnel changes, Pesch was the only remaining original member of the band. After changing her record label, she released in 1989 the fifth album as Doro, as the former label owned the trademark on the Warlock name.

Pesch now pursues a solo career and lives in New York City. 2004 album Classic Diamonds was a collaboration with The Classic Night Orchestra which reworked some of her earlier songs. Fear No Evil released in 2009 saw a brief return to the US and currently touring Europe celebrating 25 Years in Rock with a full fledged DVD out on Nuclear Blast.

She released her first album in six years, Forever Warriors - Forever United, on 17 August 2018, entering in many charts worldwide.
