Deathfix formed in 2009 after Brendan Canty (Fugazi) and Rich Morel (Morel, Blowoff) met while touring in Bob Mould's band. Having discovered a shared affinity for the sounds of 1972 - particularly glam and progressive rock - they started getting together to work on music at Canty’s warehouse studio space. Two years later, hoping to graduate the band from its studio-shut-in phase to its live ensemble phase, they recruited multi-instrumentalists Devin Ocampo (Faraquet, Medications) and Mark Cisneros (Medications) to hold down the rhythm section. Deathfix is now a full-fledged band, with all four members contributing a share of the riffs, song arrangements, and production tricks. The band’s self-titled 7-song debut was released in early 2013. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Deathfix">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
