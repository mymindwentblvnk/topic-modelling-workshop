New Zealand producer Daimon Schwalger has released music under the name The Nomad for many years.  The first album Movement was drum'n'bass, but subsequent releases have been downtempo releases with (obligatory in New Zealand) dub influences.

Prior to his solo project he was performing drum'n'bass as part of trio Locust with Pearl Runga (sister of Bic Runga) and Ryan Smith (aka The Silversmith).  They had no official releases. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Nomad">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
