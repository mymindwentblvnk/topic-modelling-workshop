Milena has been making music for some years now, visual & organic sound. 
As a former student of illustration, it is perhaps no wonder that she treats her music 
like paintings. Loving contrasts.

5 years she was living in Berlin, where her musical path took shape, where Monika Enterprise took her under her wing to release an EP with name "Can't Tape Forever" in 2006 and her debut album "Seven Sisters" in 2007. 

her second album is slowly taking shape.
