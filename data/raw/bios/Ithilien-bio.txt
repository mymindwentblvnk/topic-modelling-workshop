There are two bands with the name Ithilien:

#1- Ithilien is a Belgian folk metal band created in 2005 that is characterized by fast heavy riffs mixed with epic melodies and an almost omnipresent harpsichord, which gives the band a unique touch. 

Back in the ancient times, when earth and sky were one, an evil creature known as “Ithilien” was born. The legend says that it is the beast wrath that separated them forever, thereby creating the world as we know it. For a long time, no one had ever seen the beast again. But centuries later, it has come back to extinguish mankind. A punishment for those who destroy bit by bit his creation.

In 2005, a few valorous warriors decided to join their courage. Their reason of living: Defeat the beast and save the human race. Unfortunately, most of them did not survive the “first encounter”… But those who were still standing recruited new warriors, which are now not only ready to strike and to fight back but also eager to revenge their fallen predecessors. They are called “The Hunters Of Ithilien”.

#2- Ithilien is a one man DIY bedroom project. The music veers between doomy, slow and wistful passages and dischordant, driven black metal. Ithilien is an exercise in reflecting melancholic atmospheres, romance, sadness, euphoria and otherness. Ithilien's inspirations include the sea in darkness, piers, incense and coffee at dusk
