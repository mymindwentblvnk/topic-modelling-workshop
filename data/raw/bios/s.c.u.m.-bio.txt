S.C.U.M are a South East London based post-punk/art rock group, who formed in early 2008, its initial line-up consisting of Thomas Cohen, Bradley Baker, Samuel Kilcoyne (founder of the Underage club nights and the festival spin off as well as the son of Add N to X's Barry 7), drummer Ruaridh Connellan and bassist Joseph Williams who left early on in the band's career due to his priorities, which lay in his desire to become a barrister.  

S.C.U.M's debut single "Visions Arise" was released on Loog Records on 15 September 2008.   They went on to record their debut album "Again Into Eyes" with producers Ken and Jolyon Thomas.  On 18 July 2011, the single "Amber Hands" was released by Mute Records, described by Pitchfork as "the mammoth first single from the London shoegazers".  The album was released on 12 September 2011 and received generally positive reviews.

S.C.U.M. were chosen by Portishead to perform at the ATP I'll Be Your Mirror festival that they curated in July 2011 at London's Alexandra Palace.  On 27 August 2012 Rough Trade exclusively released what they dubbed a 'lost EP' by the band. The limited edition run of 300 7" vinyl was recorded at 1-2-3-4 HQ studios in East London and intended as a self-release. However, due to a mix-up at the pressing plant, the vinyl went missing. A recent clear-out of a storage cupboard revealed the metalwork for the pressing and it was returned to the band who approached Rough Trade about releasing it.

In January, 2013 S.C.U.M. announced via Facebook that they were splitting up after a long hiatus, making hints of solo projects to come.  In June 2013 it was announced that former members Melissa Rigby, Huw Webb and Bradley Baker had undertaken a new project named Astral Pattern.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/S.C.U.M.">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
