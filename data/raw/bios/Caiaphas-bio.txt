Caiaphas have since renamed themselves Speedreader, and are a four-piece alternative rock band from the Midlands. 

Their influences include Mew, Radiohead and The Super Furry Animals.

They have released two EPs: 'The Crush'(as Caiaphas) and more recently 'In A Way We're All Winners', under their new name.
