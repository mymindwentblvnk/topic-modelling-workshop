2] What do you do when you're Nikki Sikki, ex-front-man for Verbal Abuse, one of the most powerful hardcore bands to have walked the face of the earth, and you find yourself at a loose end with no band and nothing else to do? You get back in the ring. You go back to basics and do what you do best. You play your guts out. With Humungous, Nikki, along with Cheetah Chrome (ex-Dead Boys) hit the ground running, taking the Verbal Abuse Hardcore blueprint and adding rock-n-roll swagger and melody, to recreate the glory days and make punk rock dangerous again. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Humungus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
