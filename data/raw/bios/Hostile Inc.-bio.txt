In 1996, after the quick split up of the 80's thrash metal band Dead Scream, the death metal of Hostile Inc. was born. Adriano de Abreu and Mac Coelho played together in that band and also had Franzé Ramos as friend, who was invited to form a new band.

After calling Júlio César to be the drummer, it was easy for them to choose what metal sub-genre would guide the music of this new band. Thrash Metal was their main influence, which didn't stop them to add elements of other genres which would make their own identity and to sound original.

In 1999, with Bruno César as drummer, the promo Give'em What They Want is released. With six thrash metal tracks which already showed their preference for melodic elements, added to the speeed and heaviness of the genre.

One year after the release of their promo and now with more experience in composition and technique, the music of Hostile Inc changed a lot and they invited the keyboardist Matheus Hernandes to play with them in a concert, initially just for a cover. The band liked the idea so much that they decided to explore more of this instrument, definitely adding to their style, a more melodic and technical death metal genre.

Hostile Incorporation, as the name suggests, incorporate on stage all the aggressiveness of their music and ideas. With the line-up formed by Mac Coelho (vocals), Franzé Ramos (guitars), Yuri Leite (guitars), Saulo Oliveira (drums) and Adriano de Abreu (bass), Hostile Inc. is ready to release their debut CD, entitled Qiyamat, in 2007. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hostile+Inc.">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
