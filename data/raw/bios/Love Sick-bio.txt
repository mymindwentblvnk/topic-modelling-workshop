LOVE SICK are a Glasgow-based electropop duo, consisting of Shaun Canning & Julie Knox. The pair have been crafting their sound for a few years now, but only emerged as LOVE SICK in September last year. Shaun had been doing some great electronic music on his own, later forming a duo with Julie.
"We discovered that we shared a very similar music taste and were both making music on our own."
LOVE SICK have regularly featured on Sir Elton John’s Rocket Hour radio show on Apple Music’s Beats 1. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Love+Sick">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
