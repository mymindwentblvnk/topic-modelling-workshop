The man behind the mask, or under the crown of ‘Royal-T’, goes by the name of Mark Taylor; an 18 year old record producer from Southampton, England. Another highlight to the ‘Royal-T’ music CV is the signing of one of his instrumentals to clothing line Puma for one of their advertising campaigns which will be avaliable in April 2009. For now ‘Royal-T’ is sitting proud of his ever growing status and is aiming to release a digital and physical EP within the next year. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Royal-T">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
