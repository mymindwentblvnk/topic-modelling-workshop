Wintersoul is a Blackened Death Metal band founded in the frozen winds of 2006. A couple of songs were written and recorded by the ice-cold legion taking grim influence from the legends of the extreme metal art. The recording sessions took place during the winter nights of 2007.

In the same year, the band unleashed its first cold blast entitled "Dawn Of Ice Hearts", a demo, which brought them to the attention of several independent labels from within the metal scene. As the storms raged and snow fell, a furious extreme metal machine began to emerge and develop material for their full-length debut CD.

In 2010, the band signed a deal with Nokternal Hemizphear Records, and unleashed the nine-track blaster known as “Frozen Storm Apocalypse”, featuring some of the most savage frostbitten landscapes the band has created to date.

The immediate response to the debut album has further fueled the winter storms, proving that Wintersoul is an explosive new force in the extreme metal scene. Prepare for battle,the winter holocaust has begun. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wintersoul">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
