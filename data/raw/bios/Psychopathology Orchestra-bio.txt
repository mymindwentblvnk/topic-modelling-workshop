Psychopathology Orchestra
is a  Experimental / Progressive Death metal band from France. 

It's an one man project led by Timmy from the black metal band Astaarth.

Psychopathology Orchestra play a very bizarre and quirky brand of death metal with pummeling drums, grinding guitars, and most notably, a heavy emphasis on synths and industrial-type beats. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Psychopathology+Orchestra">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
