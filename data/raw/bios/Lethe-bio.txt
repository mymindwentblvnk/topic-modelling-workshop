10. A 3 piece band from Croatia. Their music doesn't follow any particular direction, but their main musical inspirations are indie/alternative rock and some old-school punk and post punk bands.
Lyrically, most of the inspiration is drawn from everyday situations or just based on the current emotions. They try to write the music as a coherent story or some type of journey that unravels and comes into place with every new song. Some lyrics (and music) take listener on a darker journey with lots of nihilism embedded into them, while some draw inspiration from lighter and more optimistic sources so there's something for everyone to enjoy. 
They have released an LP Control (2018) and four singles (all in 2020): Easy, City Life, Lullaby and Highs And Lows.
