There are multiple artists:

 1) The Last Stand is a hardcore band from New York City, taking in many influences from the NYHC scene. The band features former members of Shutdown - Dion DeNardo on bass, Stephen Della Croce on guitar and Jimmy McCormack on drums with Mike Scondotto of Inhuman on vocals. The Last Stand’s debut full length album entitled “The Time Is Now” was released on January 22, 2013 through Eulogy Recordings. 

2) Another was formed in 2009 and consists of Greg Schuster (bass, vocals), Billy Gallo (guitar), and Johnny Krammer (synthesizer, guitar). With a genre as mysterious as the song Submerged, the band hails from West Chester, Ohio, and will soon meet the ranks of other local bands such as Bad Veins and Pomegranates. "We're taking off," Johnny claims. The future of music will have to wait and see if his words are truthful.

3) Last Stand was a short-lived Belgian H8000 / Hardcore-band active between 2010 and 2011. The vocalist and guitarist started a new project called Nervewreck. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Last+Stand">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
