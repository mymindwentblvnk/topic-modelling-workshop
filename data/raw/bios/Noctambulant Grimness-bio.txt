Nocta has existed, first as Noctambulant Grimness, since 1998 and develops from a hobby band into a semipro act. You can call the music atmosperically black/ death metal and appeals to a broad public. Live, Nocta can certainly hold his own. An enthusiastic stage act and catchy but heavy songs belong to a succes formula. The band has had several succesfull performances thoughout the country, among which at Bolwerk, Sneek. 

After the first demo ‘After the slumbering gloom’ about which The Aardschok Metalzine has written: Noctambulant Grimness writes stylish, rather catchy songs which get even more depth by the use of clean guitars and whispering voices, about 250 of them were sold. The second demo, without title, has got the same characteristic atmosphere as the first one but it conveys the various sides of the band better. 

This second demo was recorded in October 2002 in 4 days in their private practice space with rented an borrowed gear. The numerous praises prove that this demo is once again very succesfull. : “All is worked out very well, the sound is excellent for a demo, very professional. Very catchy black metal background coupled with atmosperic passages, clean guitar parts and nice keysboard backgrounds.” “Noctambulant Grimness recorded three very good songs. There is definitely good potential here”. And “Noctambulant Grimness produces a good to listen to professional demo, I’m convinced that when Nocta keeps developing it can become a topband.”

Despite some changes in cast Nocta is ready. With a new vocalist and one guitarplayer less, the band has been more motivated than ever and ready for the studio, where the third demo 'Period' promises to become a success again. With this demo Nocta is going to conquer the crowds. 

Finally some quotes from resp. Lords of Metal, the Leeuwarder Courant and The Gathering itself: 
-“The group has got a strong live reputation .” 
-“Black metal, the most intense of its kind with two tough frontmen who sounded like they came straight from the hell-fires of the land of Mordor. ” 
-“You were without doubt the toughest supportact ever, even if you look back at our Always-era. ”
