Ricky Eat Acid is the electronic-based solo project of Baltimore musician Sam Ray, known for fronting indie pop band Julia Brown and lo-fi emo group Teen Suicide. While both of those acts have incorporated electronic and experimental elements into their work, Ricky Eat Acid is a full-on immersion into dreamy, abstract soundscapes. Easily Ray's most prolific venture, the project has yielded numerous digital releases and cassettes, with ethereal recordings varying from ambient miniatures to disjointed beats to fragile avant pop songs. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ricky+Eat+Acid">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
