Electrosoul System is the production name of new Russian sensation Andrey Burtaev. He started writing music 6 years ago and recently started producing atmospheric / progressive drum and bass 2 years ago with his friend Dmitriy.

The duo's first tune was a down tempo track and from here they had little hope that their music would be released in the future. They stuck to their guns and continued to produce the music they love which eventually led to a track being signed up. Their first release was on TAM records (St Petersburg, Russia) and featured on a CD compilation with a host of other Russian producers.

In 2002, they sent demos to LTJ Bukem and he was quick to snap up 3 tracks altogether (2 tunes for GLR and 1 for his Cookin' label). It was around this time that the duo were getting influenced by Blame, Future Engineers and Seba, and started making more futuristic and deep sounds that they felt would be more appropriate for the dancefloors.
