There is more than one artist with this name:

1) Goliard is a black metal band from Lviv, Ukraine formed in 1999

2) Goliard was a British medieval folk duo, formed by Chris Brown and Andrew Geuter in 1975.
For a few years they performed at Warwick Castle and did some concerts at the Chapter Arts Centre in Cardiff. They also played medieval music for private parties and entertained people on a night out and famous people and some of the aristocracy, including actor Victor Spinetti and the then Duke of Wellington. Broadside Records released an album by them titled "Fortune My Foe" and Warwick Castle sold EPs of their music.
The prime objective of Goliard's performances was to achieve as authentic a sound as possible, removing the instruments from the hallowed atmosphere of the museum showcase to present their strange voices to as wide an audience as possible. Because they themselves started from scratch in both the fields of music and instrument-making, a great sympathy has grown between Goliard and medieval music, for they are following exactly the same pattern set by 12th and 13th Century wandering musicians who had to construct their own instruments and develop their own styles of performance.
