Lido, aka Peder Losnegård, is 26 years old and hyperactive. This composer, producer, multi-instrumentalist and drummer since the age of two made a name for himself by posting remixes on SoundCloud (Justin Timberlake, AlunaGeorge, Alt-J, Flight Facilities, Zhu, Mø, Para One and Bill Withers among others).

Some of them have become classics – Lido has notably remixed ‘Often’ by The Weeknd and ‘Latch’ by Disclosure which he did without permission and created a tsunami in the world of EDM, making him known to Skrillex and Diplo who have been singing the Norwegian artist’s praises ever since.

A multitalented artist, musician, producer (for Alt-J, Banks, Chance the Rapper, Cashmere Cat or Halsey), he released his first lauded EP in 2014, I Love You Too, and did a victory lap with two sold-out American tours.

Lido developed his love of the stage very early on, playing in the church orchestra where his father was a pastor. His early experiences made him hungry for experiments, performing in unexpected conditions, as with the Norwegian KORK Orchestra .

His childhood in the church left him with a love of musical orchestration, arrangements and staging. And today, he presents ‘Crazy’, a forward-facing track where samples serve the organic melody of the vocals, where the orchestra, masterfully managed by Lido, is made exclusively of machines, loops and sounds combined to produce a unique blend of exotic atmosphere and electronic surges. Synthetic bass-charged music, cascading arpeggios and electric rhythms with hip-hop and gospel influences, the future is called Lido. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lido">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
