Druadan Forest is a project of Kalma aka v-KhaoZ aka VRTX (Ville Pallonen), former drummer of the Finnish black metal band Azaghal. 

It plays ambient/black metal inspired by J.R.R. Tolkien's work, in a way similar to Summoning and Valar. The band has released three demos between '98 and '99 and then disappeared together with Kalma himself after his departure from Azaghal. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Druadan+Forest">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
