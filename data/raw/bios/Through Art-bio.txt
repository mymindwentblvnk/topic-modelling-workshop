This Belgrade-based five-piece emerged onto the scene in early 2006, consisting of much of the same people playing in the band today. Their sound has evolved steadily since then, though always maintaining a strong link to a modernized death metal style. With fairly frequent releases of new demos, and playing almost every corner of their home country of Serbia, they’ve built a strong reputation within the local metal scene and among fans around the region.

The 2011 debut album, entitled “Kamaswami” (released on Greek label Sleaszy Rider Records), chronicles the search for a unique collective voice that the band has been on over the years. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Through+Art">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
