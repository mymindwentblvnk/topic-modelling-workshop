T-Rextasy played their first show at a punk pizza party. Since then, they’ve been “garnering a cult following” (The Deli) of believers hoping to hop in the dino dames’ minivan. 

In 2014, the “hyper-verbal rock & roll goddesses” (Rolling Stone) released demos they recorded themselves on an iPhone that began generating buzz in their hometown of New York City. 2016’s Jurassic Punk, the band’s debut record out on Father/Daughter Records, received praise from outlets such as NPR and its single, “Gap Yr Boiz,” appeared on a Rolling Stone “Best Songs of 2016” list. In support of the LP, T-Rextasy refined their “charming...impressive live show” (Stereogum) on several international tours that included stops at Northside Festival and South by Southwest. 
Prehysteria, the quartet’s crowd-funded, self-released sophomore record, will be released 1/3/2019. Their songwriting has developed without relinquishing its signature spontaneity. Lyrically dealing with relationship communication issues, consent, queerness, the internet and subsequent isolation and most of all, growing up, Prehysteria endeavors to inspire critical thinking while still getting people to giggle.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/T-Rextasy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
