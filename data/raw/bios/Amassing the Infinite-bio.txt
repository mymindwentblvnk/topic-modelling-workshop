Bio
Amassing the Infinite are a 5-piece progressive death metal band from Brisbane, Qld. Their sound is a unique combination of brutality and melody often with the lyrical themes using story-telling to evoke a strong sense of angst. Since their debut appearance in early 2012 they have been honing their performance into an intense live show that will leave you wanting more every time. After a busy string of live shows in early 2013 the boys have just finished recording their debut 6 track E.P. "The Bridge" through R.T.D. studios and are preparing to take the Australian music scene by force. Their first ever Single "Ode to Finality" is set to be released August 19 <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Amassing+The+Infinite">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
