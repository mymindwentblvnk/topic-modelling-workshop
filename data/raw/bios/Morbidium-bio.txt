Morbidium is a Brutal death metal band from Solvakia.  They formed in 2003 by Carcass (Guitars) and Gosh (Vokills). The band looked for a drummer to complete the line up but with no avail and started out with a drum machine.

The drum machine was used to record their first demo in 2004 called "“Decayed Remains Taken From Butcher’s Morgue”, this lead to their first gig and the joining of Xapor, (Drums, also in Distrophy) and his brother Hrobar (Guitar).
