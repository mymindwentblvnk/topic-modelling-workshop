There are two bands called Abiosis:
1. Halifax, West Yorkshire, based death metallers Abiosis issued the "Noxious Emanation" demo in 1990. Founding members were frontman Darren "Daz" Dickinson and guitarist Paul Evans. Guitarist Andrew Craighan and drummer Rick Miah joined the band around 1988/1989. The demo was heavily influenced by Carcass and Death and according to a comment made by Andrew on the forum of Doom-metal.com on October 1st, 2006, "the demo is rubbish but you have to start somewhere". 

Andrew and Rick left soon after the demo had been released due to musical differences and were to become founding members of the pioneering doom metal act My Dying Bride in June the same year. Abiosis played a few shows before disbanding. By 2006 Daz had sadly passed away but Paul was still living in Halifax.

2. Darkwave/Industrial project. They released "LebEnSunf√§hig" demo. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Abiosis">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
