Thirteen Degrees To Chaos was born in 2006. Playing a mix of death metal, progressive, hardcore and some other shit that may come to mind, they have been unleashing their music through Portugal since 2007, sharing the stage with great national and international bands (including opening acts for All Shall Perish and No Turning Back, amongst others).

They self-released their first Demo in the end of 2008 and in the beginning of 2009 "Unheard Demand” was released online, recorded by Marco Cipriano at Quickpunch Studios. In the beginning of this year, they got this track featured in the first HORNS UP magazine compilation, called “Attack, Vol. 1”.

Recorded by Cláudio Galante and produced by the band itself, “Brakyu, the Shapeshifter” is the newest effort from these guys, which will be featured in their upcoming release still in production.
