Sorrows Fall  "Desolate" Reviews:

"Your album rocks. Looks and sounds great mate. Awesome female vox!" 
Martin Walkyier 

Mixing raw and aggressive male vocals with harmonic but powerful female vocals, Sorrows Fall come across as a band in full control of their sound, well rehearsed and versed in their art. The rest of the band have collaborated to make an extremely dirty grimy sound, a heaviness which compliments the dual vocals well. Catchy and a pleasure to listen too, a band whose tracks you can simply chill too or if that way inclined bang you head too wildly. 

A classic case of sludge meets clean although even the clean vocal style of singer Trish has an element of the opposite from time to time. A band with a big future and a quality sound. (9/10)
