Former known as Forsth, this band was regrouped in 1999 by Gonahr and Max as Morgart. This Atmospheric Black Metal band is hailing from Littau, Switzerland. The lyrics on their first album Die Schlacht (In Acht Sinfonien) are about the battle in Morgarten (location in Switzerland), which took place in 1315. They are based upon the diary of the monk of Wintherthur, who witnessed the battle in his younger days.
They sucessfully create symphonic and varying song, which comprise melancholy organs, majestetic strings and a very dark atmospheric black metal symphony, linked with in-depth vocals.
