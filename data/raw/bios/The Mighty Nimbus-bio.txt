An almighty conglomerate of American Metal pedigree, The Mighty Nimbus boasted the inclusion of Sixty Watt Shaman singer Dan Soren and guitarist Minnesota Pete Campbell, the Alabama Thunderpussy and Avail credited Erik Larson on guitar, former Electric Chair Horror bassist Dinis deCarvalho and ex-Chaos Witch drummer Andy Campbell. 

Upfront of an appearance at the May 2004 'Emissions From The Monolith' Stoner festival the band undertook the 'Kill! Kill! Kill!' tour. With Larsen having opted out to prioritise Alabama Thunderpussy the group drafted Alex Petrovich of Mister Bones as replacement. The group cut a new album for Three Man Recordings in 2004, this including a cover of the Saint Vitus track 'Born Too Late' and featuring a guest appearance from Entombed, The Project Hate, Vicious Art and God Among Insects credited Jörgen Sandström. In September Minnesota Pete Campbell stood in as drummer for Place of Skulls for European tour dates. The band formed up a package billing comprising Crowbar and Entombed for US tour dates in February 2005. However, vocalist Dan Soren opted out in December 2004 and Erik Larsen took over lead vocal duties. 

The band spent the latter stages of the year working on the album 'Chronicles Of The Northern Beast'. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Mighty+Nimbus">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
