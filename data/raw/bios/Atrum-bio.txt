Hailing from Iceland, ATRUM is an extreme musical entity founded upon an idea; to create a powerful and dynamic atmosphere within complicated and challenging music. Originally forged in 2005 by vocalist, lead guitarist and composer Sigurður, rhythm guitarist Úlfar and drummer Arnar, the band has overcome line-up changes, musical changes and ideological challenges but always reached a higher level of strength.

From the beginning ATRUM has made a significant impact on the Icelandic metal scene with its forceful blend of death and black metal, mixed with Sigurður‘s and Úlfar‘s experience in classical music and, with the parting of Arnar in 2007, the band was structurally completed by the addition of Icelands fastest and most prominent metal drummer Ragnar. Never giving up on their particular vision of extreme metal, it has taken more than three years to deliver what they aspire to be one of the most impressive debuts of modern metal which should pave the way towards international activities and recognition.

Our debut EP, Opus Victum was recorded and produced by the band with help from Jóhann Ingi and mixed and mastered by metal veteran George Bokos of Rotting Christ fame, the offering is planned for release during the second quarter of 2011.

ATRUM are known in Iceland for intense and accurate live performances, incorporating strong visual and aesthetic aspects, making the show a powerful experience.

ATRUM is more than worth a listen for all fans of metal.
