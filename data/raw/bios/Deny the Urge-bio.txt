Deny the Urge was founded in 1998. A steady line up was established in late 2002 after several changes over the years. A first 5 track maxi CD "In-Consequence" was recorded in January 2002, back then with the old vocalist still. With that CD the band was already able to draw some attention not only by the fans but also by the press, resulting in very good reviews in magazines such as the german "Legacy". Following all this was a series of concerts which brought Deny the Urge together on stage with bands like Harmony Dies, Agathodaimon, Uppercut and Fleshless.
One thing that was always hard to describe for band members was the style. While mainly belonging to the genre of Death Metal, there had always been elements of other musical worlds in the songs. this coming from the great variety of influences every member has, giving the music a slight progressive touch.
The current CD "Subsequent Confrontation", the band's first ever full length album containing 8 tracks, is continuing this path. This time maybe straighter, yet faster, with an overall more mature approach to songwriting. The CD will be released via GUC Records, a fair partner for the band that should help Deny the Urge take the next step ahead. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Deny+The+Urge">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
