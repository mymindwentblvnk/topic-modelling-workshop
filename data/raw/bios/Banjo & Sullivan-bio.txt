Introduced to the world in Rob Zombie's movie The Devil's Rejects, Banjo and Sullivan are a fictional bluegrass group. Jesse Dayton put together and performed the music for their alleged greatest hits collection, "Banjo and Sullivan: The Ultimate Collection 1972-1978".

As for their fictional history... Kentucky-born Roy Sullivan was a session player in Nashville before meeting up with Mississippi-born Adam "Fingers" Banjo. Their first albums were titled "Two Silver Tongue Devils (Who Ain't Got A Clue)" and "Wasted Banjos and Drunken Guitars" released in '72 and '74, respectively. In '75, the same year Sullivan married studio-singer Gloria Harrison, their single "She Didn't Like Me But She Loved My Money" hit #23 on the country charts and it was followed by "I'm At Home Getting Hammered (While She's Out Getting Nailed)" at #23. In '77, Banjo married backup-singer Wendy Clark.

On a promotional tour for the album "Where The End Meets the Road" which featured the single "Lord, Don't Let Me Die In A Cheap Motel", the group, wives and roadie in tow, made a stop at the cheap Kahiki Palms motel where they ultimately met their doom. While it is not known precisely what transpired, the few details are gruesome and resulted in Banjo and Sullivan themselves never turning up. They are presumed dead. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Banjo+&+Sullivan">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
