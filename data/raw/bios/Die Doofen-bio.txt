Die Doofen (engl. The Stooges/The Stupids...) were a comedian  music duo (Olli Dittrich and Wigald Boning) who played some selfwritten nonsense songs together in the popular German TV Show RTL Samstag Nacht (Saturday Night Live). Their songs were so popular that they published their first album, entitled Lieder die die Welt nicht braucht (songs which this world does not need). The album was such a great hit in Germany that they published a second record entitled Music für Melonen (melodies for melons) a play on words of "Melodien für Millionen" (melodies for millions), the name of a popular music show) but this record failed to repeat the success of Lieder die die Welt nicht braucht, and so Boning and Dittrich went different ways. Dittrich is now the drummer of the German country band Texas Lightning, who played the song No No Never for Germany at the Eurovision Song Contest 2006. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Die+Doofen">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
