MENTALIST is a melodic metal band from Germany / Sweden, located in Saarbruecken. First album "Freedom of Speech" was released on August 28, 2020.

Mentalist was founded in early 2018 by Peter Moog (guitar) and Kai Stringer (guitar) in Saarbruecken / Germany. They asked their friends Thomen Stauch (drums) and Florian Hertel (bass) to join Mentalist. In 2019 Rob Lundgren (vocals) completed the lineup.

Their goal is to create a very melodic and powerful album that is bursting with power and enthusiasm. They hope that listeners will be able to honor this and hear and feel their love for this music, because then they have reached their goal. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mentalist">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
