PurEnvy hail from the steel city of Newcastle, NSW and have been perfecting their craft for many years, attracting a loyal following along the way. Fusing elements of speed and thrash metal, along with harmonies and melody reminiscent of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, this band crosses many genres and appeals to a wide range of heavy music fans.

After their first full- length album “As the Light Fades” (2013), PurEnvy set about developing and refining their style and are set to release their second album “Redemption” in June 2018. Along the way, they have been honing their live performances up and down the East Coast of Australia, maturing in professionalism and stagecraft to develop an electric and entertaining stage presence.

With the release of “Redemption” and the accompanying video clip for the first single release “Deception”, PurEnvy are poised to make the step up to national and international touring artists.

With two appearances at Sydney’s iconic Steel Assassins festival under their belt, PurEnvy are seeking out opportunities to showcase their music to a wider audience, either through festivals or touring, both at home and abroad. With the bar set high and their goals in sight, PurEnvY is determined to continue making the music that they are passionate about, tour extensively, promote their brand of melodic thrash metal and leave their mark upon our sunburnt land. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Purenvy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
