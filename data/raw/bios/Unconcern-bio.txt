UNCONCERN was born in summer 1992 when bass guitarist Jaro was joined by two maniacs - Palo (guitar) & Vlado (drums). Thus they played about a year. Then new guitarist joined them and a few days later also keyboard player Rado did so. They did not find any good vocalist around so Jaro started singing. Since this time they started to play new songs and the first gig and some small local actions in home town followed in August. Finally in September the band dropped in a studio to record their debut demo tape â€žHeart-failure". It contained 8 songs about 40 min., but the sound was pretty poor. It was a main reason that the tape was not distributed much. Some copies were given to friends of the members. The first personal change came, when keyboard player Rado left the band. Unconcem started to play without keys. They found out that they like the sound without keys and so they play without them till now. Another personal change came on drum position. Vlado left the band for he decided to play with death grind band Pathology Stench. After some rehearsals Mravec started to play drums. In November and December '96 during 4 days band recorded another demo tape "Deep In Subconscious" in Power Sound studio, Lucenec. It contained 6 song of atmospheric techno-death metal. It was recorded on professional tape with fullcoloured cover containing lyrics, and all necessary informations. Tape was released in end of February '97. Demo was sent to all possible zines, magazines in our country and Czech Republic. Concert activities grown up, reviews was sufficiently positive. Everythings seems to be on the right way. In the middle of March 98 Unconcem recorded 4 songs in Redgreen studio in Brusno. This stuff called "Natural Concem" will be released in June as a promo-tape.
