South African artist and performer Angel-Ho produces experimental club music related to themes of transgender identity, oppression, solidarity, and resistance. Chaotic, abrasive, and challenging, her music combines industrial sound design with intense club rhythms. Along with Nkisi and Chino Amobi, Angel-Ho is one of the founders of NON Worldwide, a collective of artists of the African diaspora. Establishing her sound with abstract releases such as 2015 EP Ascension, Angel-Ho made her proper full-length debut with 2019's Death Becomes Her, a more focused album highlighted by her bold, assertive vocals.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/ANGEL-HO">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
