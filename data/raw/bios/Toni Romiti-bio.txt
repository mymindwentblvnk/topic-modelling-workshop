Toni Romiti is a singer from Chicago with a sound that is a unique fusion of R&B vocals with a raw hip-hop influence. While Toni was playing college basketball, her first song gained major traction. That first song now has over 80 million plays online, and Toni has continued to build on her music catalogue. Toni chose music over basketball, and she moved to Los Angeles in 2016. Toniâ€™s songwriting often includes themes of female empowerment and gender role-reversals. As a completely independent artist, Toni has built her fan-base organically from the ground up. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Toni+Romiti">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
