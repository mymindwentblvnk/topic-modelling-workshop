At a young age Max's parents enrolled him into music school. At the age of 16 Max started his first band, LunClan, alongside his friends, but the band didn't last long. After it he was a part of a couple other projects, but neither of them was successful. As a teenager he used to record songs in Belarusian.

Then he tried himself as a beatmaker making music for other artists but to no success. After it he decided to record his songs over his own instrumentals.

Max Korzh recorded his first solo song while studying at Belarusian State University, the biggest college in Belarus. During his third year at the university he decided to drop out to concentrate on his music career. He recorded "Nebo Pomozhet Nam" (English: "Sky Will Help Us") for 300 dollars borrowed from his mom and posted it on Vkontakte, the biggest Russian social network. Shortly thereafter, he enlisted in the military. When he returned from service, he learned that the song had gotten big in Belarus, garnered a big following, and gotten airtime on the radio. Max then proceeded to send the track to Minsk DJs for them to play at parties.[1]
