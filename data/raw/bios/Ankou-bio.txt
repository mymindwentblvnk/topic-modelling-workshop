Ankou's musical world is an infinite expanse of experimentation. Gloomy atmospheres blended with alluring ambience and visceral bass production lead to savagely surreal soundscapes. The young producer from Poland has already released his music on labels such as Inspected, Saturate Records, Renraku, The Rust, and many more. His tracks were supported by Noisia themselves on their radio show. Inspired by a wide spectrum of different styles and genres, this artist is always looking for new sounds to provide a unique experience for listeners. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ankou">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
