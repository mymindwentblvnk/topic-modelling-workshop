There are two artists known as Annabel - a Japanese doujin music singer, and an indie-rock band from Kent, Ohio.

1. Annabel (Ａｎｎａｂｅｌ) is a Japanese doujin music singer born in Argentina and educated in Japan. She is a member of the music circle binaria with fellow Japanese doujin singer やなぎなぎ and the singer of anNina, a project with composer bermei.inazawa. Her songs have been used as theme songs for a number of Japanese animated series and video games.

2. Annabel is an indie-rock band from Kent, Ohio, USA. Formed in early 2005, the band can be described as "indie-pop" with the energy of punk and elements of shoegaze.  In 2009, the young troupe released their debut full-length, Each and Everyone, on Count Your Lucky Stars Records after a well-received self-released EP.  Here We Are Tomorrow, the bands latest EP is currently out for Tiny Engines records.
