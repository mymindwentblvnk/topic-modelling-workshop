The Albion Codex are a doom/prog/metal band from West Yorkshire, England.

All the members knew each other from the local metal scene, and feeling despondent and creatively frustrated with old acquaintances and bands, they decided to get together mid August 2012 to create music that each member could put their own individual taste and style into.

Taking musical influences from doom, progressive, NWOBHM, death metal and acid folk, and lyrical influences from paganism, nature, folklore and the stories of Robert E. Howard, the members bonded in music and friendship instantly.

Studio booked, amps up full, strings tuned low, riffs invoked and songs composed, The Albion Codex was born. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Albion+Codex">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
