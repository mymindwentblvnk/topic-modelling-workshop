There are six possible matches for Brain:

1.)  Brain is a drum and bass / IDM producer from Latvia. His debut release ('Tear Red' with Fee.nix-Z and MC Puma) on DSTRBD Recordings in 2004 was technically his only release, though he made a bold impression on the scene. His next track ('Banghra Dub') was signed to the now infamous Armada Recordings and to be released on a subscription package in 2005, but that outlet took a disasterous turn and never came to be. The package was offered up for free, unfortunate for the artists sake, on the Dogsonacid site. Brain now focuses on graphic design at Biocodes.net
