1. Afterlight is a Melodic Black Metal band that was spawned in Ohio, USA in 2008 and completed it's lineup in early 2009. Beginning their career sharing the stage with bands such as Mayhem, Marduk, and Absu, Afterlight has already achieved a cult following.

The debut EP entitled “Prophets of the Beast” was produced and engineered by ex-Nevermore/ex-Annihilator guitarist Curran Murphy and was released in August of 2009. Playing music inspired by classical and motivated purely by the ambition to destroy religion, Afterlight is the only band of it’s kind in the United States. Afterlight strays from the current “raw” and “old-school” black metal trend that is currently fluent in the United States using a more neo-classical/ European-influenced sound.

Afterlight is determined to be America’s answer for Melodic Black Metal.
