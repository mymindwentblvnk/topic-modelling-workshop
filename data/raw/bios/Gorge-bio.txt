1.) Gorge aka Pit Waldmann expired electronic music in the late 80’s. He grew up with the sound of Thorsten Fenslau and Alexander Abraham and began to produce his own music in the middle of the 90’s. Taking a trip through all kinds of electronic music he finally came back to house and techno music influenced by deep Chicago house sound and techhouse.

In 2005 he met Nick Curly and started the imprint 8bit records which grew up to a worldwide respected label with artists like Johnny D, Sis, Afrilounge, Gruber & Nuernberg and many newcomers always trusting in an own special sound fitting to the basic sound of the label. His own productions and remixes appear on labels like Destined Records, Suruba, Murmur, Plastic City, Freerange, 8bit, Ministry of Sound and with his radio partner Greg Silver on Yellow Tail Records. Together with Greg Silver he presents the "Plastic City Radio Show" on Sonica Radio Ibiza, starting on 13th of august 2008.
