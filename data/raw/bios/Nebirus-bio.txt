Dark and Melodic are the concepts that would define NebirusÂ´ music. This band started at the end of 2002 after the disbanding of an old musical project. Alejandro Oliva (guitars/grunts) and Tomas Figueroa (Bass) decided to mix up all the ashes from that old band and give birth to a new metal project in the searching of new sounds. Time passed and two of the former members (from the last project) decided to join the band, they were Margarita Cornejo (lead vocals) and Jaume Vizcarro (Keyboards and synthesisers) being now four young musicians that would become the medulla of the future band.

      The group started their composition process and after an exhaustive searching Hans Benavides joined the band. Now the metal project was ready to kick asses. 2005 was the year chosen to record the first studio material, Eyes of Stone, including four songs from the first years of the project. The band recorded the sounds between March and April, and the EP saw light in September of the same year, at the same time the official site nebirus.tk was launched. Different reasons made the band to take the decision of a recess so the members could work in their own musical projects, but the songs kept making noise on the internet, with excellent comments about them by the audience. 

      A warm November arrived (2006) and after participating in many other musical projects Alejandro decided to take a step further and re group new musicians to Nebirus.

At the end of the month and after some chatting Nicolas Gaete (bass)joined the band. Margarita and Jaume were considered to continue on this musical crusade being at this moment the current band members. It is in this way that Nebiurs is working in its LP to mark the return of this dark sounds to the metal scene of our country.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nebirus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
