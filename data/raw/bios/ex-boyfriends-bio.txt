Ex-Boyfriends are a San Fransisco based Pop/Rock group. They draw influence on their sound from bands like Superchunk and the Replacements. Their sound is something you might hear on the butt end of a mid nineties Lookout records sampler, the hip band on the brink of breaking out of it. They released  "Dear John" in 2005 on the Absolutely Kosher record label. A second album "In With" was released in late 2007.

Ex-Boyfriends won the Best Indie Band award for the Guardian's annual readers' poll in 2008.
