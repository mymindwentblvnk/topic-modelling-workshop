Collaboration between Irish trance producer and DJ John O'Callaghan and Irish singer/song-writer Audrey Gallagher. Their only production together so far (as of March 2008) is a vocal trance song called 'Big Sky'. This was released in November 2007 from the Dutch trance label 'Armind', along with a remix by Agnelli & Nelson. This remix was voted the 'tune of the year 2007' in Armin van Buuren's radio show 'A State of Trance' in 20th December 2007. Four new remixes - three by EDX and one by City Zen were released in March 2008 from the same label.
