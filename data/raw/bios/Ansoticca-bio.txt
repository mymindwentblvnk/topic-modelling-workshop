These three musicians have met in the year 2008, to bring their passion for epic symphonic-metal to life. 
Although surely influenced by acts like Within Temptation or Nightwish they succeed to step out of unifomity and to create an own sound that attracts and touches. 
Epic melodies, combined with heavy guitars is the simple but effective mixture, a sound that already causes positive reactions worlwide and proves the fact - 2009 will be the year for AnsoticcA - and, more important, for fans of good music.
