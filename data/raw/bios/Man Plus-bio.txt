Man Plus is an American art pop band originating from Seattle, Washington. Since the band's formation in 2005, it experienced frequent personnel changes, but has always maintained the presence of principal songwriter Jared Mills. In 2007, Man Plus was further enhanced by the addition of multi-instrumentalist/hip-hop producer Manat Macleod and guitarist Jeremy Don.  Filling out the current lineup is longtime drummer Ben Findley and vocalist/arranger Ellen Mills. 

Man Plus' work shows influence from post-girl group pop, Motown, electro, punk rock and post-punk. MP has also garnered much attention for its prolific output, with a seemingly endless fan club-only singles, EPs and releases under fictitious band names.  Most MP songs clock in at under three minutes and feature multiple vocal and instrumental hooks and tight, shifting song structures.

Man Plus progressed over time from a homespun willfully scuzzy basement obscurantists to relatively professional riff-pop machine from 2007 forward.  The constants throughout these changes are Mills' grasp of the pop format, cryptic lyrics and titles, and melodic invention.
