Loz Contreras, real name Lawrence Elias Contreras, is a drum & bass DJ based in Leeds, UK. He got into dnb in 2005 after listening to High Contrast's album High Society. At the time he was a funky house bedroom DJ, and when he studied university in 2006 his roommate, who was a liquid dnb producer, convinced him to start producing. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Loz+Contreras">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
