Drag The Dead is a collective of some of the most brutal Death Metal musicians the St. Louis Missouri metropolitan area has cultivated in years. Drag The Dead bring uncanny, unprecedented brutality to the stage and to the ears and imagination of the listener. The sound of Drag The Dead has been likened to the act of being bludgeoned to death by a 10 ton wooden hammer dulled by centuries of slamming into rotted earth. Prepare your soul to be pummeled relentlessly. Enjoy the beating. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Drag+the+Dead">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
