Hidden In the Fog is a metal band from Magdeburg, Saxony-Anhalt which was formed in 1996.

About two years after forming the band would release their first demo Into the Moonlight's Cold Embrace. A year later, their second release the EP Of Hidden Chronicles & Stellar Fires was released. Their third release Promo 2001 was released in March of 2001. The CD was well-received, and the band received contract offers from smaller underground labels. The band's drummer would leave during 2001, which prompted former keyboardist Botis to switch to drums. With the lineup-change in place the band would record their full-length debut Abstract Maelstrom Paragon. The album was well-received critically and they would later on sign a contract with Twilight Vertrieb who would re-release the album in 2004. In 2005, they recorded and released their second full-length album Damokles. Once again they received critical praise, Rock Hard gave the album 9.5 of 10, Metal Hammer awarded the album 6 of 7 points, and 9 of 10 in Scream Magazine. In 2006 long time members Gorbag (guitar) and Draug Carcharoth (bass) would leave the band. They were replaced by Alexander F.J. Creuzfeld and Lothargie respectively. They have not released any material since 2005, and it is unknown if they will record more music.
