SINDECADE is the creation of former DARK FORTRESS vocalist AZATHOTH, and former Dark Fortress guitarist CROM.

Having left Dark Fortress to form his own project CROM, a melodic epic metal band, Crom remained close to his old colleagues, and thus was born the collaboration between two friends that was to become SINDECADE, a terrifying melding of Azathoth's vocals and Crom's musicianship.

SINDECADE's only release is the "Terrorcrowned" EP, which was released on Walter "Crom" Grosse's label Neocration in 2006.  Both Crom and Azathoth.  This will be the one and only release.
