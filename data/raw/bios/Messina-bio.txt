A thrash metal band from Holland formed in 1988. They released one full-lenght album "Terrortory" in 1990.
Originally this band was called Assassin but due to the German band with the same name they changed the name to Messina. If you listen to the lyrics of the Song Messina you can hear that this song was about their original bandname. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Messina">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
