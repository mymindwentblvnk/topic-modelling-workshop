1) Band was formed by the sitar/guitar player Gualberto in 1967. At the beginning of the seventies Smash recorded two albums for Philips label "Glorieta de los Lotos" in 1970 and "We Come To Smash This Time" in 1971. Unfortunately early death of the vocalist Julio Matito bring band to the end. Music which Smash create is compare to Moody Blues and Vanilla Fudge psychodelic mood. Through guitar style of Manuel Molina we hear evident flamenco touch, applying on traditional "palos" (tarantos). The leader Gualberto has recorded a few progressive albums with Ricardo Mino, mixing Hindu music to conventional Spanish flamenco guitar works.
