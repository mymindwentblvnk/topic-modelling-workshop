2001. Some schoolfriends, hailing from Vilvoorde, Belgium, decide to start up a band. Some growing pains were conquered, and Overweight was born. What started out with several punk- and rockcovers, soon evolved into a mix of selfmade songs, spiced up with some creatively covered songs of popular children- and animationseries. A very important step for Overweight was the introduction of a horn section, comprising a logical evolution towards skapunk. 

An improvised studio was the setting for a first demo, « What we call paradise », which opened a lot of doors. A new demo was released in 2008, titled “Back to life with a hangover”, which resulted in a bunch of shows. Later that year, Thomas left the band to spend some more time on other challenges in his life. An ample replacement was found quickly: ever since, Willem Merckx has been in charge of the plucking of the bass. 

Through the years, this fun loving gang has built up a rather excellent live reputation. Wherever they go, their catchy party songs are a guarantee for some good old-fashioned crowd mayhem! Overweight already had the honour of sharing the stage with bands such as Mark Foggo’s Skasters, Janez Detd, P.O. Box, The Maple Room, Homer, Skafield, The Disliked, El Guapo Stuntteam, Peter Pan Speedrock, Five Days Off, The Hicky Underworld, de Heideroosjes, A Brand,… 

In 2009 the band presents its first full-CD: “The world for sale”. Ten neatly recorded tracks, with the catchy skapunk tunes definitely being a highlight! Fun, terrific atmosphere, feel good and occasionally a sonic guitar avalanche: this is probably the best way to describe Overweight in a nutshell.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Overweight">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
