In 2012th autumn two guys from different cities accidentally got to know each other and decided to make something totally sick. Then two more guys joined this sect of doomed and that was the birth of scum called Thy Grave.

No guitars, nothing superfluous, just percussion, basses and voices from everywhere around you, shrouding you with impenetrable mist and taking under ground straight to hell.

Meet Black Sabbath vs. Rodriguez Tarantino Grindhouse.
