In 1995 the 1st incarnation of 1080 began in New Plymouth. Bringing together Punk with pop sensibilities. After recording a demo late that year both guitarists left with bassist Biggy (R.I.P) leaving to do vocals for Inebriation.

The remaining members Emily and Craig H soon recruited ex Nefarious bassist Craig Toxic and guitarist Lyn M. They released their 1st EP 'Thrills, Chills and Chemical Spills' before disbanding in ’97.

Undeterred drummer Craig produced a new and improved line up (pictured) of Dan Gretch, Nigel Toxic, and Renee (ex-Demon Dolls) Leishman. This line-up put out 2 CD’s: 1999’s 'Chopper Chic' which features songs by all 3 lineups and 'Hard Candy' in 2000, both on Toxic's Demon Nation Music.

2008 has seen 1080 reform with Renee moving back to New Plymouth and with the addition of Marc Gernhoefer on guitar. Unfortunately after a few Jams we have decided that it is time to leave 1080 to rest.
