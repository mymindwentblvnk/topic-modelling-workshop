Strong Like Bear was a sludge metal band from Fargo, North Dakota who formed in 2003 and split up in 2007.  Their lineup was comprised of Ryan Cofer (now a member of the band Battlefields), DJ Klocke (now a member of Thundersaw), Chuck Kesler and B. Young.  During their time together, the group released  a single (2005’s “I’d Rather Be Drowning”), a full-length (June 2006’s self-titled album), and an EP (April 2007’s Nature Red in Tooth and Claw).  Due to demand for their recordings after splitting up, the band agreed to put their two main releases on Mediafire for free downloads, which appear on their Myspace page as well as on this page.
