Dreyelands are a melodic progressive metal band from Hungary. 

In 2002, long time band-mates Andras Adam Horvath and Gergely Springer decided to form a band to play progressive metal music. After few and quick line-up changes, when Omar Gassama, Zoltán Kas and Nikola Mijic (Alogia, Expedition Delta) joined the band they got a lot of positive feedbacks for their progressive and AOR cover shows and Dreyelands began work on their own material.

Their debut album ‘Rooms Of Revelation’ showcases the bands versatile attitude for music being a tasty mixture of the metallic and the melodic side of progressive and power metal, combined with a touch of 80s AOR/hard rock music.

Dreyelands will surely be cherished by those who like Dream Theater, Symphony X, Pagan’s Mind, Circus Maximus, Jorn Lande, Evergrey, Redemption, etc.
