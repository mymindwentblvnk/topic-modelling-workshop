Bleeding is a Metal – Project from Northern Germany, deriving from the Hamburg Area.
The members are Haye Graf, Marc Nickel and Jörg von der Fecht, who knew each other from the beginning of the nineties. 

Under the strong impression of a Psychotic Waltz concert they decided to join forces once again and formed Bleeding.
