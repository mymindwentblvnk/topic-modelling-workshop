Steven Julien (Funkineven) is no stranger to groove. Over the past few years, the London native has grown to become one of the UK's finest electronic musicians; a skilled and soulful technician whether perched behind a pair of decks or a sequencer.

Born and raised in West London with Grenadian blood, his first rhythmical dabblings came as a dancer. Beginning as an MC and beatmaker, he quickly found his feet moulding smooth cuts of his own. Artists from A Tribe Called Quest through to Jaco Pastorius became regular reference points and those early jams nestled somewhere between house, soul, boogie and techno.

Steven released his debut EP with Eglo Records back in 2009, which ushered in a more mature chapter. Two years later, he founded Apron Records; an incubator for music-makers putting together honest electronic music like Greg Beato and Shanti Celeste. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Steven+Julien">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
