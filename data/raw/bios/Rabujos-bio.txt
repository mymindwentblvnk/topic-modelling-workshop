Rabujos was formed in ´94 by some friends and has had several formations. The band unites fast and agreessive hardcore music with poetry in its compostitions. Themes vary between social critiscism and member´s personal issues, always trying to give a subjective tone or provoking reflexion in the listener.

The band released in 2003 an EP/CD with ten songs titled Contra Tudo e Contra Todos (Against Everything and Against Everyone). A new release with another eight songs, a 4Way split with other three bands from Brazil´s Northeast region is scheduled for next year´s first semester.
