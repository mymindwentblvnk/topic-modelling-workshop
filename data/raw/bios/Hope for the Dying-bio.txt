Hope for the Dying formed in November of 2006 with sights set on bringing something different to the table. Tiring of the typical simplistic music that has manifested itself in the heavy music culture, Hope for the Dying brings new meaning to the idea of “guitar-driven metal.” By blending the musical virtuosity of old school shred-metal pioneers like Iron Maiden and Metallica with the modern edge of today’s progressive heavy-hitters like Between the Buried and Me and The Human Abstract, Hope for the Dying is developing a signature sound that is as technically proficient as it is fresh and unique.

In 2008, Hope for the Dying was featured in HM Magazine’s “Pick-of-the-Litter” section and subsequently inked a deal with the newly resurrected Strike First Records (a division of Facedown Records) and released their debut self-titled full length on November 25 of that year. Since the release of the album, the band has been hitting the road hard, shredding across the country playing as many shows as possible in as many new places as possible.

Hope for the Dying is still touring as much as possible, as well as being in and out of the studio, working on writing new songs for the much-anticipated follow-up to 2008’s debut. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hope+For+The+Dying">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
