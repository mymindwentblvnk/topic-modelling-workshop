3) Power-electronics band from St. Louis. It was created a tribute/parody of bands such as Bloodyminded, Whitehouse, and others. Most songs are based around fairly ordinary situations but performed in the context of a power-electronics or noise band.

They were formed in 2007 and have only played a few sparse shows in the St. Louis area. Their stage performance is marked by fake mustaches similar to the "Sabotage" music video by the Beastie Boys.
