After more than ten years together in the band Mercury Fang, an urge to develop and explore new musical territories made the band members search for a new vocalist to start a new chapter.

After trying out a couple of great male singers, female singer/composer Maria Rådsten (One More Time) entered the studio and made an audition that showed her extreme vocal abilities that stretched from subtle and beautiful all the way to the most powerful imaginable.

The new born band immediately started to write material for an album and after only 2 months, Misth performed six brand new songs at their premiere gig in Stockholm, Sweden.

With the immediate success that showed the new band´s ability as a live act, inspiration flowed like never before and Jocke Skog (Clawfinger) was soon hired to produce and mix the debut album, an album that is now ready to be discovered by fans of melodic and progressive metal all over the world <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Misth">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
