Malummeh is a group of five young men who share the same passion for creating incredibly great, intense and aggressive music. This fairly young band from Finland was formed in 2004 and afterwards reached its current form in the summer of 2005, as the new singer kicked in.

Ever since their first public performance and first songs published, they have been raising wide range discussion all over Finland as well as abroad. Known of their brutal and vivid stage performance, Malummeh has gathered quite a reputation as a kick-ass live band. Malummeh has also established a solid fan base which keeps on growing and growing.

Signed to Spinefarm Records 2006, gigs to come, album at 2007, this is only the beginning. No holds barred. Deal with it.
