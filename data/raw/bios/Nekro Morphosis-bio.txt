Nekro Morphosis was spewed forth from the waste of Washington in the year 2000 originally as a solo project. The first full lineup came together in late 2007 with Dr. Destructo on drums, Nightmare on bass & founding member Carnage on vocals & guitar. In late 2008/early 2009 the lineup curse had struck, Carnage continued to handle guitar & vocal duties, Guldrelokk was recruited on drums and Chad on bass. Now the once solo project has become one of the most aggressive, raw, evil and brutal black metal acts around. Nekro Morphosis combines constant brutality mixed with riffs that will bring any true metal head back to the glory days of extreme metal and of course all while injecting their own chaotic spin on things. In May of 2010 Nekro Morphosis parted ways with bassist Chad and recruited Shitstorm to take over bass duties. Nekro Morphosis has begun writing new material for their next full length to be released in late 2011 and also has a 4-way split cd due out in June. In April of 2011 Shitstorm left the band, but as always we march on and soon The Death of Morality will be complete and then the venture through the land to spread nun fucking brutality to the rest of this fucking planet begins! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nekro+Morphosis">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
