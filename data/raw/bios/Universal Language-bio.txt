Behind this mysterious name stands László Adorján (from Budapest, Hungary) who has been writing electronic music since his early age.
Starting with deep house releases back in 2010, he slowly got into more raw, dub-oriented sounds made with machines. As a DJ he also prefers to keep the music deep and dubby, regardless whether it is called house or techno.
In 2013 he started to explore the more minimalistic, but organic side of his music under the name dubkid. He is always in the process of learning and refining various approaches of making music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Universal+Language">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
