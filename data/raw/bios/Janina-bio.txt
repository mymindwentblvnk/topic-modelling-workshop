2) Janina is a 21-year old born in Germany. Her minimalist instrumentation is almost mandatory in such a prominent institution. Original lyrics and catchy musical tones Janina then sings "For the life of a friend", denounces the big city anonymity with "wrong questions" or postulates the grass as the last automatic failure of the affluent society. What should you do if "night at half past three" suddenly runs out and the Dope Dealer of trust has long evening? Whether in German or English, whether in a studio or live recording session. Janina pulls it all before, look carefully at their instrument to deal. But it does so with a noticeable song by song temperament, which simply captivates. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Janina">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
