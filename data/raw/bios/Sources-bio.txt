"People are pissed and Sources know it. Hailing from Sarasota, Florida, a town known for its elderly and beaches, this deathcore sextet are ready to breathe life back into a generic scene. The members are no strangers to the metal scene, playing in various local favorites and have earned a respectable work ethic throughout Florida. With the majority of the members graduating high school, this young band is craving to make themselves noticeable in a scene of dying trends and half-hearted spirits. Formed in early summer 2009, Sources has already been opening for major national and international acts such as For The Fallen Dreams, Legend, I Declare War, And Hell Followed With, Thick As Blood, Suffokate, Like Moths to Flames and The Red Shore.
Sources thrive with their live show, which has been known to be interactive, often violent hardcore dancing and moshing and love to provide the mic for anyone to scream along. Their first show was cut midway through due to the crowd getting too violent. Already becoming a south Floridian favorite, Sources continue to maintain their metal onslaught with their heavy influences from Slipknot, Whitechapel, Molotov Solution and After The Burial. Like their heavy counterparts, Sources believe in meticulous guitar tones and heavy pummels, often raising eyebrows and turning heads.
Sources’ various uses of blast beats, tremolo picking, heavy riffs, and honest, yet graphic lyrics suggest that Sources are not just your average deathcore band; they want to show people that they have every right to be angry and why our society is ignorant. Already gaining praise from south Florida, Sources yearn to tour in the upcoming year and plan on releasing their “Karma” EP in February. Keep an eye out for updates from the band on Twitter and Facebook. "  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/sources">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
