In winter 2004 the project Mortal Storm was created. At this time we only were a 4 men occupation. The search for a 2. guitarist became very long-winded, since several people had an interview with us, but it never was the correct one. Our music was to be assigned to the Deathcore/ Trashmetal at this time rather. We became with volume, as Six Feet Under compared and after some gigs also could address a modest public with our music. In December 2006 Mortal Storm was reunited, because after the loss of a guitarist and our drummer it was not to be counted starting from May 2006 any longer on the fact that we will make music again. The current music direction resembling the Metalcore/Trashmetal. Further follows...
