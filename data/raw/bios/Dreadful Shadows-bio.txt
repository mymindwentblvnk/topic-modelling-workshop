Dreadful Shadows was founded in Berlin, Germany, in 1993, by Sven Friedrich, Jens Riediger, Ron Thiele, Frank Hofer , and Reiko Jeschke - and would go onto become a staple act of Gothic rock and Dark wave, pioneering the Gothic metal sub-genre. During their career, Dreadful Shadows produced four albums ((1994) 'Estrangement', (1997) 'Buried Again', (1998) 'Beyond the Maze', and (1999) 'The Cycle'), three EPs ((1995) 'Homeless', (1999) 'Live in '98', and (2000) 'Apology'), and toured extensively over Europe and Russia. Though they disbanded in 2000, in 2007 they reunited for live audiences, and remain an active live band to this day. The current line-up features Norman Selbig and Andr√© Feller on guitars.

Sven and Norman also co-founded Zeraphine in 2000. Sven has a solo project, Solar Fake, as well. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dreadful+Shadows">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
