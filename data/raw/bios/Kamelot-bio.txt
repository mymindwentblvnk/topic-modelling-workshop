While the Kamelot from Tampa is the most prominent band of this name, there are more bands using it in the world:

1) Kamelot is a power metal band from Tampa, Florida that incorporates progressive and symphonic elements into their music. The band was founded by guitarist Thomas Youngblood and drummer Richard Warner in 1991.

In 1994 the band signed a deal with Noise Records; the release of their debut album Eternity followed in 1995. The next album, Dominion, was released in 1997.

Later that year, two of the band's members were replaced; drummer and founder Richard Warner and lead vocalist Mark Vanderbilt. Respectively, their replacements were Casey Grillo and Roy Khan (Roy Sætre «Khan» Khantatat from Elverum in Norway - formerly of Conception). With the two new members, Kamelot released their third studio album, Siege Perilous. The new line-up undertook an extensive tour through Europe during the fall of the same year only to return to the Gate Studio in Wolfsburg twelve months later to produce the fourth studio effort The Fourth Legacy.

The summer of 2000 brought the "New Allegiance Tour" through Germany, Austria, Switzerland, The Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, Greece and Spain during which the recordings for Kamelot's first live album The Expedition were made. Only a few months later the band presented their fifth album entitled Karma, to the greatest critical success yet. Their sixth album, Epica was released in 2003. Both Epica and the band's seventh effort, The Black Halo, which was released in 2005, are based on Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's version of the legend of Faust, a man who sells his soul to the devil. To support the new album the band went on tour through Europe and Japan during the first leg of the "Black Halo World Tour 2005", with special guests Epica and Kotipelto in Europe and support Silent Force in Japan. They also played on the Bang Your Head!!! Festival in Germany and the Graspop Metal Meeting in Belgium.

In 2005 they shot their first music videos ever, for the songs The Haunting (Somewhere in Time) and March of Mephisto from the album The Black Halo. Both videos were shot by acclaimed director Patric Ullaeus. The 5th of October 2005 saw the addition of Oliver Palotai as the fifth official band member. Oliver will handle both keyboards and (additional) guitars.

On the second leg of the "Black Halo World Tour" they visited North and South America (USA, Canada, Brazil) as well as Europe (The Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden and Norway). During this part of the tour the bands first live DVD was shot, with the main concert being shot on February 11th, 2006 at Rockefeller Music Hall in Oslo, Norway. The shoot was again handled by Patric Ullaeus. The DVD (and live CD) called One Cold Winter's Night was released in November 2006.

Ghost Opera is the eighth studio album from Kamelot. It was released on June 1st, 2007 via SPV/Steamhammer Records, in Germany and then followed by releases on the fourth and fifth in Europe and the USA, respectively. The album was recorded and mixed at Gate Studios and Pathway Studios in Wolfsburg, Germany with producers Sascha Paeth and Miro. The first video from the album is for the track Ghost Opera, and can be seen on the band's official MySpace site. A video for the song The Human Stain was shot and released later.

Following this was their ninth studio album, Poetry for the Poisoned.  It was released on the earMUSIC label, a subdivision of Edel, on September 10, 2010 in Europe, and four days later in North America by the band's own label, KMG Recordings. The release sees the return of founding member Sean Tibbetts (who formerly used the stage name Sean Christians) on bass guitar. A video was recorded for the song The Great Pandemonium and released on the band's official YouTube channel on September 6 (it's also included on the Special Edition DVD release of the album). Simone Simons returns to supply guest vocals on a few songs.  Amanda Somerville, Gus G. and Björn "Speed" Strid are also featured.

On September 6, 2010, Kamelot announced that Khan wouldn't be able to perform with the band on their North American tour, just a few days before its scheduled start, and had returned to Norway. While it was initially reported that the band would continue the tour with the Norwegian vocalist Michael Eriksen of Circus Maximus in Khan's place, the band later announced that it would postpone the tour with Khan, though one show was performed with Eriksen at the ProgPower USA XI festival in Atlanta, Georgia, on September 10, 2010. However, on December 16, it was announced that Fabio Lione of Rhapsody of Fire would replace Khan for the remaining and rescheduled dates on the Pandemonium over Latin America, Europe and North America tours in 2011, and later the 70,000 Tons of Metal Cruise in 2012. Other guest singers appeared on selected shows, such as Simone Simons singing The Haunting (Somewhere in Time) and Don't You Cry, Tommy Karevik singing Center of the Universe, EdenEcho or The Human Stain, Snowy Shaw as Mephisto on March of Mephisto, Alissa White-Gluz also as Mephisto on March of Mephisto and Atle Pettersen on Karma. 

Following a period of uncertainty, Khan and Kamelot released separate statements on April 21 and 22 2011 respectively, announcing Khan's departure from the band for burnout and religious reasons.

On June 22 2012, Kamelot introduced Seventh Wonder's Swedish vocalist Tommy Karevik as their new official vocalist. Karevik had previously appeared as one of the guest singers on the 2011 Pandemonium World Tour, and was thrilled about his new position: “I am so honored to now be a part of this family and I can't wait to move into the new era of the band together with the guys. I fully understand that this comes with great responsibility and that it will be a big challenge for me as a singer as well as a person, but you can rest assured I will give it my all. From this day, a new journey has begun and I am really eager to meet you all along the way to share my passion for this music!”. Their first show with Karevik was on July 12, 2012 at Masters of Rock.

Kamelot returned to the German label SPV GmbH to release their tenth record, which was unveiled as "Silverthorn" in July 2012. Silverthorn was released on October 30th in North America, October 26th in Germany, and October 29th in the rest of Europe via Steamhammer/SPV. The CD marked the band’s first release with new singer, Tommy Karevik.

Silverthorn went directly to the top, debuting at the #1 position on Amazon’s Heavy Metal Chart. Along with this accomplishment, KAMELOT also impacted major charts in other categories including the #9 position on Billboard’s Hard Rock Chart, #24 on the Rock Charts, #79 on Billboard’s Top 200 Chart, as well as appearing on multiple international charts. 

A music video was released for the first single from Silverthorn, Sacrimony (Angel Of Afterlife). The band joined Nightwish on their North American tour as special guests during September and October 2012 in the period leading up to the release of Silverthorn, along with guest vocalists Elize Ryd and Alissa White-Gluz. Following the North American tour, Kamelot embarked on a headlining European tour during November 2012, with support on the tour coming from Xandria, Triosphere and Blackguard. The band also toured new countries on the Silverthorn world tour including Australia, Korea and Taiwan. 

On February 23, 2015 the title, artwork, track listing and official release dates for Kamelot's new album were revealed. The new album titled "HAVEN" will make Kamelot's history as it will be released worldwide (excl. Asia) on Napalm Records/Universal and Napalm Records/ADA/Warner as an exclusive licensing deal through the band’s Kamelot Music LLC on May 5, 2015 (North America) and May 8, 2015 (Europe and rest of the world). 
Produced by acclaimed music producer Sascha Paeth and mastered by Jacob Hansen, Haven "features all the signature elements of KAMELOT but the band steps out to add new and modern elements along with bringing some amazing emotions that harken to the band’s earlier days." (Source: official press release). Additional guests include Alissa White-Gluz (Arch Enemy), Troy Donockley (Nightwish) and Charlotte Wessels (Delain). 

Following the release of HAVEN, Kamelot will embarque on a massive world tour, starting with North America in April/May 2015 followed by European shows in the Summer 2015 and with The Haven European Tour in September/October 2015 the band will return to Europe for their biggest headliner tour to date.
