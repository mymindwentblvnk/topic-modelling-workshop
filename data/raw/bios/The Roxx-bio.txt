Germany based THE ROXX were founded in 1984, in "The Golden 80ies of Heavyrock". THE ROXX join the track of NWOBHM, with bands like Judas Priest or Iron Maiden, as well as following 70ies legends like Black Sabbath or Alice Cooper. Betimes THE ROXX experience with crossing borders of classic Heavyrock, like by adding synthy-based sounds, sitars, banjos or a Rapper to Heavyrock.

Besides music, THE ROXX focus on complex arranged liveperformances. Backdrops and actors on stage support the song`s messages for the audience.

The band`s first vinyl release SUGAR AND SPICE from 1986 with its plastic-bubble cover is a collectors item today. ON THE ROXX and BOY BITCH were played in the discotheques, and made it on the collection MUNICH CITY NIGHTS. SUGAR AND SPICE was followed by WATCH US CUM in 1988, with the synthy-heavyrock hitsingle DREAM GRIPER. Besides: WATCH US CUM was badly cut, bootlegged, and wrong-titled GET IT HOT in Europe and Russia (in Russia even rumours were spread that GET IT HOT is a secret project of Rob Halford and Metallica`s bass player Jason Newstead). 

The following album CHILLS DOWN YOUR SPINE (1990) was never released, as guitarist ANIMALE died. THE ROXX` mastermind, 4-octave-singer and songwriter BILLY ITCH met guitarist L.X. Gaitanides, who is in the band since then. 

The 1990 doublealbum SEX & ROXX & ROCK'N' ROLL (Part I and Part II) was the band`s most classic Heavyrock album. Anyway for the track THE WAY TO BABYLON a dixieland band sat in and joined THE ROXX. The ballade MAY BE made it into the german charts. A strange detail is the limited vinyl EP WILD THING (960 copies), with an empty b-side and packed in a pizza cardboard. 

1992 the album NO SOLE MESSIAH was released. NO SOLE MESSIAH presents various songwriting, and with indian sitar and saxophone contributions again some openminded sounds.

After the 1994 live album WILS THINGS LIVE, it took 12 years for the band to release the 2-track EP TRIGGER/RIP in 2006, 20 years after their first album. The 1995 announced album DOMINATOR was never released. On TRIGGER a NY-rapper fights out a discussion with leadsinger BILLY ITCH. 

2007 the album UNLEASH YOUR DEMON was released. 2008 saw the 30 track doubleCD HISTORY DECADE ONE 1984-1994, as well as the Live-DVD UNLEASH THE DEMON (recorded in 2006).
