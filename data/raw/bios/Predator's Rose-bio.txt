The story so far   
Predator’s Rose was established in the summer of 2006 by bass player Rasmus Olesen, Guitarist Jacob Druedahl Bruun and their drummer at the time. The idea was to write original music of a high technical level in the heavy metal genre, inspired by bands like Iron Maiden and Helloween. 

In January 2007 the band started looking for a lead singer. Kathrine Ringsborg was a natural choice. Her full and unrefined vocal was a good match to the style of the band, and she was a great contrast to the traditional male lead singer, which is predominant in the Heavy Metal genre. She also brought a new creative site to the band with her talent as a song writer. 

The band was now able to plan the recording of their first demo, but due to creative disputes a change of drummer was needed. Martin Helbo was shortly after chosen for the task. The band then started writing material for their first Demo “First Prey”. After a lot of hard work and wiser from obstacles, the band was finally ready to release their demo in October. The good response from the community led to a couple of concerts in the spring and a mini tour in the summer of 2008. 

In the fall of 2008 Predator’s Rose started the recordings for their 2nd demo. This is expected to be released by the end of February 2009. After a year that was productive and rich in live performances Predator’s Rose is now ready to focus their creative energy on showing the world who they are. The Band has grown to meet the challenges on their way both as a group but also as individuals. So with a recipe for melodic hard rock, infused with technical finesse from heavy metal,expectations for the future are great.
