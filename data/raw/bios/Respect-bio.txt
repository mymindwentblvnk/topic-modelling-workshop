A bulgarian hip- hop band.
The city is Plovdiv, the names are Krum and Tsetso. They start playing the piano since 5 years old, but the place they get their real musical skills is the national school of music and dance art "Dobrin Petkov". At first Krum and Tsetso show interest in Break Dance, but then realize what really excites them is music. The year when the time comes for something more serious is 2002, that's when the group Respect is created. At the begining the group members are not just these two, but reach to four. Unfortunately the rest gave up hip-hop and took their own path. Respect happens to be the first bulgarian hip- hop band that has musical education. 
In 2005 Respect buy equipment and create their own  label named "Respect Records", giving a chance to other talented performers from the area to carry out their ideas.
In the site you'll find large part of the group's work, interviews, videos to their songs, information about upcoming events and freely ask questions about stuff of your interest.
Thanks to everybody supporting the group, it means a lot! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Respect">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
