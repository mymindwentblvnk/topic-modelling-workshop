Jessica 93 is the post-punk / cold wave one-man-band project by Geoffroy Laporte from Paris. Laporte is also a member of Besoin Dead,  Missfist and Les Louise Mitchels. The name, Jessica 93, comes from the fact that Laporte's mother told him that if he had been a girl, she would have named him "Jessica", the 93 comes from a nickname given to him by a friend, "Jojo 93".

His latest album, Who Cares, released at the end of June, 2013, has received praise from the French music press and is available on three music labels: Et mon cul c'est du tofu?, MusicFearSatan and Teenage Menopause.
