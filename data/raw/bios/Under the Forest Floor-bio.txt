under the forest floor hail from the dark depths of the eastern kentucky.  they play in a storage building which they rent to play.  they are vernon eversole on lead and rythm and jimmy gibson the same.  drums is george brashear, and pete combs on bass.  they were only together for a year before vernon dropped off.  they played many local shows and everyone loved them even the emo fags and scene kids but were well respected my the true black and death metal fans which are few and far between in our area.  i myself was a long time friend of all the guys.  im pretty positive the rest of the  guys still play but i don't know of any shows.  they get their musical inspiration from the they're opressed lives in the small town they live in and most of the darkness and beauty behind their songs come from they're love for nature, death, satan, and the macabre. i  consider them to be a talented small town nightmare that only eastern kentucky could produce.  they are one of a kind in my opinion.  someone should find them and promote them.  this is all based on my personal relationship with all these guys over the years and my association with the band for some time.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Under+the+Forest+Floor">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
