Sator Square is is a band of musicians that like our metal a little on the dark side. Until our first release takes wing, you can listen to some of our tunes from our MySpace site. A dark Heavy Metal band with a thrash-Sabbath edge. We incorporate an eerie atmosphere of theatrical metal, using the sound of heavy guitars with piano/synth tones floating on a foundation of solid visceral beats to create the sound that is unique to Sator Square. 

• Blackie Sanchez from Benedictum, one of San Diego's favorite premier drummers laying a solid and even foundation 

• Tom Dustin from Prophecy, who provides ball-breaking guitar leads and harmonies 

• Will Schmehr our ominous keyboard player who produces the gothic sounds that provide the power to Sator Square 

• Grover Ballmer who propels the rhythm with his touching melody styles and relentless chunk-attack 

• Jeff Sheets who's melodic bass counterpoint drives a solid bottom wedge into the heart of the performance 

• Ron Lerma from bands like Piece of Mind & Teabag, who's unique singing style is reminiscent of the melodies of Queensryche, mixed with a powerful modern guttural death edge. 

There is great interest in our product and show from our fans and Rock 105.3, including radio play and live performances at exclusive events. Internationally (via online), myspace.com has ranked us solidly on the top-ten list for the last year.
