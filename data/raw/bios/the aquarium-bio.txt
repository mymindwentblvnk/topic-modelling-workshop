The Aquarium is a duo from Washington, DC, featuring Jason Hutto (ex-Motor-Cycle Wars) on keyboards and vocals, and Lauren Harris (ex-Threads) on drums. Their music features "a hypnotizing set of instrumental and vocal compositions often accompanied live with random movie clips culled from Jason's library collections." They have been playing shows in the DC area for the past few years, and will be releasing their first full-length on seminal DC-based indie label Dischord Records in October 2006.
