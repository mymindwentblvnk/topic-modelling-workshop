2) Capone aka. Dillinja (aka. Trinity, D-Type & Cybotron)

Described by Goldie as "the bass explorer of the nineties" and adjudged "The Grand Master" by Grooverider, Karl Francis a.k.a. Dillinja, is one of the most famous drum n bass producers.

His first tune, "Tear off your Chest" was produced at very low cost, and being self-motivated he pressed up about 500 test pressings and sold them with the help of a close friend who worked behind the counter at London's Black Market Records.

According to 'http://www.breakbeat.co.uk/dillinja' "by the time Dillinja was 23 he had over 50 releases to his credit, making him one of the most prolific and influential drum and bass producers around today. His early supporter, V Recording maestro, DJ Brian Gee cites him as being probably 30 or 40 per cent responsible for how drum and bass sounds today."

3) Capone is also a chicano rap artist from California. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Capone">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
