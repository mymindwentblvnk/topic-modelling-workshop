"The formative, pummelling rumbles of a new Welsh band who know that all the greatest sounds come from the heart, not just what has filtered through their souls from an iTunes library. Wicket flow. They'll bear you along in their eddies of sound, sweep you to vistas new, if you're prepared to jump in." -Adam Walton BBC Radio Wales

Wicket started as a University project between three music students in Cardiff, brought together by shared influences and a desire to bring visuals and music together to form a live show. Wicket is: Raurie Allen 6'0", Spud Nash 6'0" and Danny Jaques "Shorter". A year on and Wicket still continue to tour and perform regularly in Cardiff and the Bristol area. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wicket">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
