Low-fi sounding yet high spirited, Burning Moon have always performed black metal with a keen sense for dynamics and memorable riffs, not to mention a subtle keyboards that never dominated their sound but rather enhanced their atmospheres. Songs like “The War of Aeiser,” “Damnation,” “A Realm Called Muspell,” “Summoning of Demons,” “Immortal” and “Children of Baphomet” truly stand the test of time—they’re just as invigoratingly energetic as I remember hearing them all those years ago. Most likely to be appreciated by those who found Emperor’s or Satyricon’s earliest works to be amongst their best, Burning Moon never found any true international recognition and perhaps that’s the biggest tragedy here. One of Canada’s best underground black metal bands, hands down. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Burning+Moon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
