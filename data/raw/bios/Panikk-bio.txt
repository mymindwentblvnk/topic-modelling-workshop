Gašper »Gapa« Flere started forming thrash metal band Panikk in 2008 after his previous band Patrons split up. The first line – up included Tim Tajić (Eruption) on solo guitar and Danjel Pobeg (Black Willow) on drums. After brief participation Tajić left the band because he focused on his original band Eruption, then Pobeg left the band because his band Black Willow reunited. The band's 2nd line – up was formed in march 2009, with the following members: Žiga Podgornik – Jakil on solo guitar, Janez Kramer on bass guitar and Simon Intihar on drums. After a year and a half, numerous concerts in Slovenian clubs (they were also a supporting band for Derrick Green's Musica Diablo) and a recorded demo of 4 songs, Flere decided to dissolve that line – up because of personal conflicts between members and different interests in music. The new line – up was finally formed in february 2011, members are: Nejc Nardin – solo guitar, Rok Vrčkovnik – bass guitar (ex Thraw), Grega Košmerl– drums (ex Patrons) and Gašper »Gapa« Flere – rhythm guitar/vocals (ex Patrons).
