Solarisis was a melodic death metal band from Enschede, The Netherlands. With death metal as a departure point, elements of thrash, doom, black and heavy metal were combined into one coherent style. 

Solarisis was formed in October 1995 in Enschede, The Netherlands by Gijs van Ouwerkerk. For the next four years it was strictly a one man band, with Gijs being solely responsible for writing and performing on the band's debut CD "Holland Is Made Of Tofu" (released by Morbid Records in December 1999). After the recording of this CD Gijs found some capable musicians and starting January 2000, Solarisis have been operating as a full band. 

In 2001, Solarisis got some more exposure in the United States with an appearance on the Dwell Records tribute album "Overload 2 - Tribute To Metallica", with the highly acclaimed "deathified" version of 'Nothing Else Matters'.

In November 2003 the band made it to the finals of the Aardschok magazine Metal Bash competition (which had over 150 entries), playing in the huge Maaspoort venue in 's Hertogenbosch with the likes of Machine Head, Epica and Trouble.

After the recording of their second full-length album "Of Plague Proportions" in 2007, the band decided to call it quits. The album was never released on a label, but was made available for free download by the band.
