Dorian Opera was formed in May, 2007. All professional musicians, Oliver (guitar), Joe(bass, vocals) , Andrew Roussak (keyboards) and Harry Reischmann (drums) had already had an experience of playing played together in various bands in Baden - Wuerttemberg, South Germany.

The band name DORIAN OPERA was chosen to stress a link between classical and rock music (Dorian is a scale mostly often used in rock compositions). The main influences of the band are, among others, Dream Theater, Symphony X, Yes, Rush, ELP, Marillion, as well as European classical, barocque, renaissance and medieval music.

The debut CD - No Secrets - was released on the progressive rock label from Russia - MALS Records, in June 2008. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dorian+Opera">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
