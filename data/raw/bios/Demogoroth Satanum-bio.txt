Demogoroth Satanum is a four piece Black Metal band from Soweto, Gauteng formed in 2009 by guitarist Brian (Thronum) and drummer Martin (Funeral). Almost immediately there were challenges which resulted in the absence of vocals on the band's first demo which was released in 2010.

2010 came to an end with very little happening with the band, this carried on until late 2011 at which time the band began to compose and record material for the EP "True Black". This work marked a dramatic turn in music style to more traditional Black Metal reminiscent of early Darkthrone (Nor) and Mayhem (Nor).

In the dawn of 2012 guitarist, Modiba (Belgaroth) joined the band and was soon followed by Sabelo (Lord Azazel) on vocals which further solidified the band's sound. For the duration of the year the band polished and perfected their playing and began preparing for live events.

On the 1st of February 2013, Demogoroth Satanum got on stage for the first time with bands Touched by Nausea and All of Eternity supporting Botswana Death Metal band, Overthrust on their South African tour. 

Currently the band is working on their first album titled "Antichrist" and is looking forward to playing stages all around S.A.
