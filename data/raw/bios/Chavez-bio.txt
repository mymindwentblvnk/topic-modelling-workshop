Chavez were/are a Math Rock/Indie band from New York fronted by guitarist/vocalist Matt Sweeney. Theirs is a relatively poppy style with 4-minute songs usually in a recognisable verse/chorus structure. This poppiness is augmented with complex rhythm/vocal interplay and novel, sometimes uncomfortable guitar sounds.

The band formed iteratively around Sweeney between '92-'94. They released Gone Glimmering in '95 followed by Ride The Fader in '96, both on Matador. 

Sweeney, a longtime friend of Smashing Pumpkins' Billy Corgan, has also played in Corgan's side-project, Zwan, and more recently in a duo with Will Oldham on their Superwolf album.

Pitchfork recently reviewed the new Chavez compilation which also contains some nice observations about their sound and its context.

After a lengthy hiatus between 1999 and 2006 they have recently begun playing extensively around the New York area. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Chavez">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
