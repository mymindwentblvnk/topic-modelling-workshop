There is more than one artist with this name. Kurtz from the UK are part of the Soundmaker Records stable.

1. KURTZ, a guitar/drum duo from London, UK.
2. Kurtz, a Sludge Metal band from Atlanta, USA

1. Twin brothers from Wakefield, Frederick and Ralph Fuller are KURTZ. Based around the setup of one baritone guitar, a drum kit, and lots of pedals; the instrumental songs KURTZ craft range from primal punk riffing to huge, brooding soundscapes.

EP +1 was recorded in the glamorous environs of an old Victorian toilet under Kentish Town Road with Adam. B Daniels. Songs such as the ZZ Top meets Black Sabbath ‘Run Faster’, the Battles-esque loops of ‘DDD’ and the epic ‘Skyscraper’ show a startling breadth of invention.

As befits the art background of the brothers, live visuals often feature at the band’s gigs, which are an experience different from their recorded output. With Frederick preferring to play guitar on the floor amongst the crowd (when soundmen let him) and the two veering off into improvised sections, it’s a spectacle that belies the group’s diminutive member count.

And they’re really, really loud.

‘+ 1 EP’ will be released in August 2009 on CD and online through Soundmaker Records.
