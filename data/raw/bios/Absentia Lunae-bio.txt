The musical path of Absentia Lunae has started in 2002 from the merging of Climaxia (guitar), Khrael x.e. (drums), previously former members of V.o.r.a.g.o., and Ildanach (singer), previously in Aisling, in a somber creature that will be complete, in his primeval formation, with the entry of Sephrenel on Bass in 2002.
The result of seven months of dark creative devising was the debut Marching Upon Forgotten Ashes on June 2004, after a tormented search for a sufficient sound result. Few months brought the sold out of the first 500 copies press showing the consideration gained in the underground scene.

The result of the renewed, funeral but martial inspiration is the drama that will be lived with the release of the second album that we forward to you:
