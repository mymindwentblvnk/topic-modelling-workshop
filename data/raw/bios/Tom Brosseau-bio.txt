Tom Brosseau is a performing songwriter who grew up on the wide-open prairies of the Red River Valley of North Dakota, in a family steeped in traditional music and culture.  Citing influences as diverse as Nick Drake, Cole Porter, and Woody Guthrie, Brosseau composes poetic new Dylan-esque folk inflected acoustic rock. Delived in a unique high lonesome sound, his minimalist sound has often been described as "haunting", or simply "stunning".

Currently living in Southern California, Brosseau often performs with Angela Correa as Les Shelleys. After several self-promoted releases, Seattle's Loveless Records released What I Mean to Say is Goodbye in 2005, and has re-released his 2001 self-titled album, Tom Brosseau (the "blue album") with new bonus tracks.  FatCat Records released a new compilation, Empty Houses Are Lonely, in Spring 2006.
