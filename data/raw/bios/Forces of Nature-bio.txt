There are a number of bands named Forces Of Nature;

1. Having emerged in the mid-nineties, Forces Of Nature (Tony Reeves and Chalke Lom) were
part of the exciting new wave of artists that emerged as electronic music began to work its way
into the mainstream. Spotted and signed by Clean Up Records, home of the Sneaker Pimps, the
band went on to record two albums (one of which was featured in Musik magazines top 100 albums of 1996) and several singles for the label, remixing artists such as The Shamen and being remixed themselves by the likes of Big Bud and PFM. During this time they were DJing extensively around the south coast of England and were considered one of the major influences on the local drum and bass scene. They had a weekly slot and were deeply influential in helping NRG FM, the areas biggest underground radio station, attain their permanent license, in 1999. They have always been very prolific producers, and 3 releases on LTJ Bukem’s Earth and Cookin’Records imprints were to follow, adding further weight to the band’s back catalogue. The new century saw a change of direction for the band. They started their own label Tundra Records, releasing a mixture of downbeat and electronica, which ran until around 2004. After 10 years of music production, Chalke left the band in 2004; Tony continued to develop the Forces sound, gigging extensively, and working developing FoN into a full live act.
