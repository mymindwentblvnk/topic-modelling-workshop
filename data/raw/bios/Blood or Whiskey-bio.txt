Blood or Whiskey formed in Kildare (IE) in 1995 as an irish folk / punk crossover band, similar to The Pogues. Their first two albums were also heavily influenced by them.

In 2003 lead singer Barney Murray left the band. Vocal duties were taken over by guitarist Dugs Mulhooly. Untill 2005 they underwent alot of line up changes, leaving Dugs and Chris (drums) as the only original members. In 2005 they released their third album Cashed Out On Culture, which had more of a punk-edge than their former two.

In 2006, whistle player Alan Confrey died from a heart attack tragically after the band returned home to Dublin after a UK tour with Stiff Little Fingers.

Early 2007 saw the departure of bassplayer and second vocalist Beano. 
In december of the same year they supported The Pogues on one of their christmas shows.
