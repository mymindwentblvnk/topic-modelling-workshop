The Killing is a six piece metal band hailing from New Jersey. The band was founded in 2001 and recorded their debut album, "What Is Yet To Come." Since then the band has recorded a followup EP entitled "Exhibit A" and is working on another full album which is tentativelly titled "Anticipating The Eschaton."

There is also a brutal hardcore band from Newfoundland under the name the Killing that were around from 1999-2004. Their shows were known to be fairly rowdy, especially their annual halloween set, which would consist of half-original material, and half-misfits covers. In 2004 they played their last show, the halloween show of 2004, and broke up. Members started the band BRAINS!, which broke up in may 2006. In 2007 The Killing re-united for a few shows in June. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Killing">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
