Charagnanna was formed back in 1989. A rehearsal demo followed that same year. The style was very primitive black metal. The line up was: Charagnanna on drums and vocals and Sandor Boon on guitar. Sandor Boon left in 1990 to pursue other passions, so Charagnanna decided to play all the instruments himself. The second demo "Charagnanna's Land" came out in 1992 and "Conjuration of the Wicked" followed in '93. COTW was also the first Dark Wave orientated recordings by Charagnanna. Black Metal elements were still there, but it was totally different from the first two demos. Other recordings that followed were: Dark Tunes From The Netherworlds (1995), Enchantress of The Seventh Night (1995), Promo I (1997), The Serpent's Eye (1998, re-release with bonus tracks 2001). Between these recordings (1989-2001 era) a lot of unreleased tracks had been recorded.. Especially during the tapetrading days these recordings were swapped all over the place. From 2002 until 2007 a lot of new tracks were recorded and it was back to the Black Metal roots again. These tracks were never officially published. Only a few friends got copies from him. Charagnanna decided to put this solo project on ice after 19 years (December 2008). The reason: He wants to focus on his work at Uncle S. Recordings and some other music projects.
