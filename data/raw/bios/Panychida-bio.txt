Czech pagan band founded in 2004 in Pilsen by Sinneral (guit.) and GHM (voc.). Soon completed by Honza (guit., a member of OBLOMOV) and Talic (bass). PANYCHIDA means ancient commemorial ceremony of our ancestors. The music of the band could be described as "pagan black metal", resp. "paganized metal" due to the terminology of the band itself. First songs were recorded in 2004/5 as a home demo recordings. In 2006 the band recorded short disk called "Promo 2006", which contained two songs and got good ratings in zines and in the crowd. Later that year PANCHIDA recorded first full length album in Hellsound studio. Drums on this album were made by Honza Kapák (AVENGER, Open Hell fest organizer, who later became a permanent member). The album was released on FOLTER records in the middle of 2007 under the title "Paganized". The band is very active on the field of live playing. They played all around the Czech republic and even some gigs abroad. In the autumn 2008 the singer GHM decided to leave the band due to personal reasons. The replacement was found in Apia Mysteria, the female vocalist of Prague´s death metal band BELLIGERNCE. In this new line-up the band took a part on the 2008 czech mini-tour with serbian THE STONE. More gigs are planned for 2009. Next album should be released within the end of this year as well ....
