The Bay Area-based alternative rock quartet Creeper Lagoon comprised singer/guitarist Ian Sefchick, multi-instrumentalist Sharky Laguana, drummer David Kostiner, and bassist Geoffrey Chisholm (later replaced by Dan Carr).
Their debut LP "I Become Small and Go" appeared on the Nickelbag label in 1998 and SPIN named them the best New Artist that same year.
EP album "Watering Ghost Garden" followed two years later before the LP album "Take Back the Universe and Give Me Yesterday " that was issued in early 2001.
Shortly after this release, Ian left the band, to form the now defunct Captain Paper and his currently ongoing solo project called Ghost Baby, followed by other members and leaving Sharky to pull together a new outfit.
This time with Sharky on vocals, Creeper Lagoon managed to release 2 more albums: "Remember the Future" in 2002 and "Long Dry Cold" in 2006. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Creeper+Lagoon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
