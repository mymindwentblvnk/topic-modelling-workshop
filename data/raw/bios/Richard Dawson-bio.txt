Richard Dawson is a folk musician from Newcastle upon Tyne, England. His 2014 album Nothing Important was released by Weird World and was met with critical acclaim. His 2017 album Peasant received similar acclaim, and was chosen by The Quietus as their album of the year.

A much-loved musical spectacle in his native Newcastle for many years now, Dawson is a skewed troubadour who sings and plays guitar with a rare intensity and a very singular style.  Dawson’s music is a collision of opposites, his hoarsely cracking voice suddenly rising to a magical soar that’s been compared to Tim Buckley, John Martyn and Richard Youngs, while his battered acoustic guitar veers from stumble to sublime in a way that can recall Sir Richard Bishop or Captain Beefheart, add this to his snaring way with words and Dawson’s got you pinned. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Richard+Dawson">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
