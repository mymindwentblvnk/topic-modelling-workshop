Maston is a one-man solo project by Frank Maston. Strongly influenced by seminal figures Brian Wilson, Phil Spector, Harry Nilsson, Burt Bacharach, and Ennio Morricone, he first produced two solo cassette EPs in 2011 with the aim of evoking the atmosphere and traditions of 1960s Los Angeles pop music. His 2013 LP Shadows furthered this effort. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Maston">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
