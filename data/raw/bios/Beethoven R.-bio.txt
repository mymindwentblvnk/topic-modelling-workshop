Beethoven R. is a heavy metal band from Madrid (Spain) founded in 1997 by the bassit Jose Maria. Their concerts always start with the famous piece, 5th Symphony of Beethoven. 

In 1999 the album "Ja,ja" was released and was managed by the label Avispa. They continued doing concerts and started to prepare for their second album.

The second album, "Un poco mas" was also managed by the label Avispa, and the theme "El Guardian de tu piel" was one of their best hits.

The vocalist was unhappy with the new direction that the band was heading in and decided to leave. The band found a new vocalist - Kiko Hargall.
Due to the same reason, Ivan Urbistondo and Javier Kiercheben decided to leave the band.

The band couldn't continue doing concerts, so they met Jose Ignacio and recorded their last album "El legado de Judas". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Beethoven+R.">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
