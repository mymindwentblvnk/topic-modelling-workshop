Cian Nugent is a guitar player and composer from Dublin, Ireland who combines personal passions, such as squicky pre-war blues, traditional musics, late 1960s & '70s singer-songwriters, jazz ambitions, modern composition and the Takoma school into a deeply personal style. His music boasts an orchestrated and fully instrumented sound that is playful and eerie at the same time.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cian+Nugent">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
