Skybombers are a young up coming band from Melbourne, Australia. Their EP "Sirens" consist of 5 tracks. The new album is now out and is called "Take Me To Town". The Skybombers found themselves in a strange situation last year because they were not being played by rock stations in Australia, but at the same time were being played in California, on the radio.

Influences include Oasis, Nirvana, You Am I and The Clash.

Before they were the 'Skybombers' their band was called 'Collusion' and they played music the sounded like a cross between the Cure and Placebo. That sound and obviously that name didnt last long before they renamed themselves 'Skybombers' <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Skybombers">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
