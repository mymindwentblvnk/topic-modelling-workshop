Darkified was a death metal band from Söderköping, Sweden. Despite the fact that Darkified has only released one demo tape and an EP, they are well-known in the tape-trading scene of the early death metal circles and are a cult underground band. In 1995, Repulse Records released their demo tape "Dark" (1991) and their classic EP "Sleep Forever..." which was released on the legendary Drowned Productions Label in 1992, as a compilation album titled "A Dance on the Grave". Their lyrics deal especially with the works of H.P. Lovecraft. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Darkified">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
