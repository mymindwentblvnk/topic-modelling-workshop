bio from:  Black History Music Â» Lee Sain: A soulful master
By Lee Lupo writer for The Muskegon Chronicle

His family sang songs of praise. But the tempting grooves and beats coming from a small Muskegon club lured a young Lee "Floyd" Sain into the world of rhythm and blues. The Muskegon Heights native would go on to become a recording artist for the legendary Stax recording label, where he traveled and performed alongside such well-known artists as Otis Redding, Isaac Hayes, Denise Williams, The Staple Singers and Rufus and Carla Thomas.

Sain scored several minor hits, including "I Can't Fight It",and "One Girl" which peaked at number 17 and 7 on Chicago's rhythm and blues charts in 1968. 

Sain, 62, is the youngest of seven children born to Neeley and Nona Sain, who moved the family from Arkansas to Muskegon Heights in 1942.

Almost immediately upon their arrival, the Sain's put together a traveling gospel group named "The Five Gospel Singers," which featured their eldest son, Cornelius and Daughters Elnora (Owens) Beatrice (Frye). 

A decade later the younger Sain siblings, including brothers Lee, Gene, Ray and Latrice, formed a younger version of the group, named "The Five Gospel Singing Juniors." As their family grew, the group's name was changed to the "Harps of Zion." The gospel group, which now included LaVerne,Lee(Scott), Ray and Christopher Sain, released several gospel albums during the 1960s and 70s.

Lee Sain moved to Springhill Louisiana in 1979 where he is semi-retired from performing. He can often be found working with aspiring musicians and singers at a community youth center near his home.
