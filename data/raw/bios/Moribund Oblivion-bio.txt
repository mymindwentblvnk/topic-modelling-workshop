Moribund Oblivion was formed by Bahadir Uludaglar in the year of 1999. There have been many member changes in the group until this day and they have found their ideal line up with guitar and vocals by Bahadir Uludaglar, second guitar and back vocals by Ugur Ke..ioglu and drums by Fatih Kanik. Moribund Oblivion put their first work 'Like a Falling Haze' on the market in 2002.This work was limited and sold as a EP. In this EP, Moribund Oblivion worked with Vedat Sakman who is an experienced and respected Turkish musician far from the bands style... The aim of this EP was to promote the first album 'Khanjar'. Khanjar was out on 6 january 2004. On the same day Moribund Oblivion performed a premiere concert supporting the famous metal group 'Moonspell' from Portugal and drew very much attention in this concert. The group also made an album promotion tour in 5 cities and this was the first black metal tour in Turkey. The tour was including Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir, Eskisehir and Bursa. At the end of the tour the group performed in Barisarock and Rock The Nations festivals and shared the same stage with Greece's famous black metal group Rotting Christ in Istanbul. For "Khanjar" album, they also made a video for "Ruins of Kara-Shehr" and this video was showed in the channels like TRT and Dream TV for a long time. Moribund Oblivion made an agreement with Atlantis Music from Istanbul for their 2 nd album ?Machine Brain?. Moribund Oblivion tries to introduce black metal -which is monopolized by the Scandinavian bands- with the label of 'Turkish Black Metal' and its modern sound. The band became known abroad and gained fans in different countries with Khanjar and they now aim to be a worldwide name with their last album "Machine Brain".
