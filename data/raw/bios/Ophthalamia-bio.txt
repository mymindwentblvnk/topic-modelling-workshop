Ophthalamia was a melodic black metal band from Stockholm, Sweden. formed in 1989. They were probably best known for their fantasy themes and strong prog rock/doom metal influences.

"Ophthalamia" is a fantasy-world created by IT. The Goddess of this world is the woman with the demons, called Elishia. IT has also created the surroundings of Ophthalamia (I guess that the shores of Kaa-Ta-Nu are a part of this world, as the sea of Ragiih-Nib and the moutains of Makubu-Keen are), the land's creatures and the language. All songs of Ophthalamia are lyrically connected to stories about this fantasy world. 
The first lead vocalist was All, but he moved and was replaced by Shadow on 'A Journey in Darkness'. After that Shadow was replaced by Legion on "Via Dolorosa". After Legion left for the band Marduk, All is back in the band as lead vocalist.

Winter, the drummer, was a member on both of the albums, but he left Ophthalamia right after "Via Dolorosa" was recorded and was later replaced by Bone. The bassist Night replaced Mourning on "Via Dolorosa" and is now the second guitarist, and Mist joined the band as its bassist thus the last known line-up is as follows:

IT: guitar, additional vocals (whispering, speech)
Night: guitar (acoustic and electric)
Bone: percussions
All: lead vocals
Mist: bass <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ophthalamia">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
