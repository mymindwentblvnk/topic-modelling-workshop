From the need to blast forth some seriuosly catchy and oldschool death/grind Those Who Bring The Torture sprung in summer 2007. Comprised of various members from Ribspreader, Knife In Christ and Taedeat this act is bound to vomit some dirty rhymes and beats the ugliest possible way.After just a week of writing recording and mixing the debut album was done, containing everything from gindattacks to midpaced death metal anthems and grooving tunes ripped right out of the slimy chest cavities of bands like Impetigo, Grave and Carcass.
