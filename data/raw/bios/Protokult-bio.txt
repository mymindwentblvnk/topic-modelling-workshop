Protokult is a pagan black metal band from Canada.

The seeds of Protokult were sown in the dreary autumn of 2003, when two young Slavs who shared the same passion for metal - Martin and Misha - crossed paths. Dawid joined the duo shortly after that year. What resulted from this union were many years of sound searching, maturing, numerous auditions and lineup changes; while all the while, the trio firmly remained at the helm.

A short-lived four track demo surfaced in 2005, vanishing almost immediately as the lineup changed yet again. Thus, the band naturally began to evolve into the more mature pagan metal monster. Gregor, a local Irish keysman, joined within the frostbitten winter of 2008, giving the band a full live lineup once more.

As the decade began to come to an end, in the summer of 2009, armed with more than an album's worth of exhilarating material, the Kut decided it was time for a proper, full-length, independant release, encompassing where the band has been, and what they have become. Ancestral Anthems straps the listener in on a soaring journey of epic proportions, through the barbaric landscapres of a time long gone, emitting blackened thrash metal convulsions with beer brawling traditional folk influence. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Protokult">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
