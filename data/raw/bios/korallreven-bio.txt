Korallreven are Marcus Joons and Daniel Tjäder.

It all started on the South Pacific island Samoa some years ago when Marcus was there for a longer vacation and one day, while chillin’ under a coconut tree, got a feeling of how he wanted the pop music of his dreams to be. Spiritual like the local Samoan Catholic church choirs, hypnotic like the breathtaking tropical nature and, overall, a feeling of that you finally had reached to ”the other side”.

So, since some summers he and dear friend Daniel – who aside of this play keyboard in The Radio Dept. – have suffered some blood, sweat and even tears to turn this South Pacific dream into reality.

After releasing some singles ('The Truest Faith', 'Loved-Up' and 'Honey Mine'), the duo released their debut full-length 'An Album By Korallreven' on November 15 2011 on Acéphale. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Korallreven">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
