The name Dreamscar came about through conversation. It was something that Pat thought of a while ago; when it was introduced to the other band members it stuck and Dreamscar was born. So what is Dreamscar? It is described as a dream that stays with a person, good or bad; a dream that will forever be in one's mind. The band Dreamscar hopes to do just that. Through their music they hope to make an impression that will stay with fans, old and new.
