Originally formed under the name Bulldozer in 1998  in SÃ£o Paulo but upon discovering another band using the same moniker they changed their name to Dragster, releasing an EP, New Times.   In 2002 they discovered this moniker was also used by another band whereupon they changed it again, this time to Mad Dragzter. They  have successfully released two full-length albums: 2003's  Strong Mind and 2006's Killing The Devil Inside. On August 20th, 2015 another album was released Master of Space and Time. The band is currently taking some time off and hopefully they will soon get back in studio to record some good thrash metal stuff.
Line-up (last known) consists of : Tiago Torres (guitar and vocals) , Gabriel Spazziani (guitar) , Armando Benedetti (bass) and Eric Claros (drums), ex-Tiger Cult.
Previous members of the band are : Alessandro (drums) , Tarcisio (vocals) and Evandro Junior (drums). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mad+Dragzter">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
