With influences including Sigur Ros, Explosions in the Sky, Ocean Size, Pelican, Cult of Luna and ISIS, the men of Orogeny have a clear appreciation for epic music. In January 2008 the outfit joined forces with Al Smith (The Devil and Abbe May, Eleventh He Reaches London) at Bergerk! Studios to record Range; a 52 minute musical rollercoaster. The result was a progressive debut album and invaluable recording experience with one of Perth’s leading sound engineers.

The initial response to Range has been positive. Kindly described by legendary Seattle recording engineer Ed Brooks (Pearl Jam, REM, ISIS) as having ‘a unique sound that is really cool’, the album evokes a range of emotions and feels like something of an odyssey: one epic journey composed of smaller journeys. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Orogeny">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
