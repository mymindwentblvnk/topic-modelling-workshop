"Messiah Force could be thrown in the simpler pile of speed metal, comparable to Agent Steel's Skeptics Apocalypse (not that its a bad thing). Speed is always over the top but the structures remain to be fairly straightforward and aren't always the most dynamic. Regardless the tracks here are distinct among another and there's tons of energy from the lineup, especially from our lady Lynn Renaud on vocals." - Xeogred
