"Ally the Fiddle" is an uncommon Instrumental Folk Metalband from Northgermany. Founded in 2008 by the violinist Ally Storch (violinist of bands like Haggard and ASP) she now combines her love for Irish Folk and Celtic Stuff with the sound of a modern Metal Band. So she found four musicians to join her with their skills and ideas: Robert Klawonn (guitar), Diemo Heuer (guitar), Thorsten Hartung (bass) and Stefan Hukriede (drums).
