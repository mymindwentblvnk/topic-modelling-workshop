The Negro Problem is the brain child of Mark Stewart (aka Stew) and performs an intriguing blend of psychedelic rock, funk, motown r&b, and Bacharach-style pop.  The band's name is meant to be ironic, as the music industry doesn't seem to know what to do with a band fronted by a black man that doesn't necessarily perform what gets typically shoehorned as "black music" in the modern segregated music industry.  The band tries to harken back to the era of "Jimi Hendrix" and "Sly and the Family Stone", where rock music wasn't just marked as a "white" genre, and lovers of smart, biting, well-crafted pop music are definitely richer for their efforts.
Stew is now on Broadway with his Tony award winning (Best Book) Passing Strange. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Negro+Problem">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
