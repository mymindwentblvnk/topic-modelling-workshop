Banisher, a technical and experimental metal band, has been founded in 2005, in Rzeszów, Poland.

After their first demo entitled “Sorrow of Death” (2005), EP “Human Sacrifice” (2006), several gigs & festival appearances they released their debut album, “Slaughterhouse” (self-released, by the end of 2010). The band then relocated to Cracow.

However, the true shape of the band emerged in 2013, with the new line-up and new album “Scarcity” (2013, Unquiet Records/Defense Records).

The music on “Scarcity” is a slight change of pace compared to what they’ve done before. The tracks are faster, simpler and more intense, which makes the album an extreme and relentless 30 minutes of death metal maintaining their own personality and originality through groovy rock’n’roll riffing. The drums warrant particular attention, as they were recorded by Łukasz “Lucass” Krzesiewicz (Gnida, Sammath Naur, and several other bands in which he was a session drummer).

Lyrical themes include several topics: the criticism of contemporary society, its values, the fragility of human mind, various conspiracy theories and unsolved criminal mysteries.
Having shared the stage with the likes of Vader, Hate, Mgła, Sceptic, Hatebreed, Moonspell, Samael, Gorgoroth, Dimmu Borgir, Blasphemy, Fleshgod Apocalypse, Watain, Cynic, Cryptopsy, Grave, Sadist and many more Banisher has extensively toured a great part of Europe and appeared on multiple festivals: Inferno Metal Festival, Metal Head’s Mission, Cieszanów Rock Festival, Headbangers Fest, RzeszOff Art Festival, Eastern Deathfest, Gahlenmoscht Fest, even as a headliner at Metal Blast in Cairo, Egypt. The energy emitted from the stage, with crazy antics and skilled musicianship is best to be experienced live.
In Januray 2014 Jacek Gut joins the band as a permanent drummer. Jacek was helping the band as a live musician since 2013. Currently the band is recording the new album, still pushing the boundaries of extreme and technical metal.
