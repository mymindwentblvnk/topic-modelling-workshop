Gary Floyd is an independent singer-songwriter from the United States, best known for fronting the punk band the Dicks in the 1980s, as well as Sister Double Happiness and Black Kali Ma in the 1990s. He plays country, blues, and folk music, and is a Hinduist and communist. Floyd was recently in the Buddha Brothers. He was one of a handful of openly LGBT musicians in the punk scene (as well as allies Randy 'Biscuit' Turner of Big Boys and MDC vocalist Dave Dictor).

Floyd, Buffx Parrot, Pat Deason and Glen Taylor started the Dicks in Austin in 1980. In 1983, Floyd relocated to San Francisco and, with new members Tim Carroll, Sebastian Fuchs, and Lynn Perko (formerly of all-women band The Wrecks), a second version of The Dicks began recording and playing. The group disbanded in 1986.

Gary Floyd then started the blues-rock band Sister Double Happiness in San Francisco in the late 1980s. After that band ended he formed and primarily played in Europe with The Gary Floyd Band; an overview of this material, Backdoor Preacher Man, is available in the United States. Toward the late 1990s, Floyd played in Black Kali Ma, who released an album on Alternative Tentacles.

In 2004 and 2005, Floyd played a series of reunion concerts with the original Dicks, with the exception of Glen Taylor, who had died in 1997. His role was filled by Brian Magee. At the Austin show, the band was joined in singing Wheelchair Epidemic by David Yow. 

Austin's Butthole Surfers wrote a song about The Dicks bandleader called "Gary Floyd." Also, the hardcore band Limp Wrist, on their 2004 song The Ode, paid homage to Floyd and Randy Turner. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gary+Floyd">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
