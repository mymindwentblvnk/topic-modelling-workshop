Cloakroom is a brand new musical entity conceived in the harsh rurals of north west Indiana. Cloakroom consists of three factory workers from the Region -- Doyle Martin, of disbanded pop punkers Grown Ups collaborated with drummer buddy Brian Busch and fellow Region native Robert Merkof. Despite the frantic, fast paced nature of their other acts, Cloakroom rarely touches on its member’s previous work. Instead they are found channeling the visceral vocals of David Bazan, laid over quiet ethereal guitar hums that slowly grow into pounding walls of sound, at times bringing to mind a more stoned, yet delicate Jesu. Undoubtedly, comparisons will be made spanning an array of genres from stoner metal to 90’s emo, but what Cloakroom have created with is a flawless conglomeration of sound that until now has yet to be heard. The band released the single "Lossed Over" 7" in 2014, and their debut 2xLP "Further Out" was released in early 2015 on Run For Cover Records.  Their second album "Time Well" was released on August 18th 2017 via Relapse Records.
