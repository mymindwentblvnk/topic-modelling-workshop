From the grottes of hell rised up a disgusting slimily monster of gore: “The S.A.G.D.” Five extrovert butchers founded the department in autumn 2004. In their homevillage Oberlangen in the Emsland (ass of the world) they wanted the people to convert to their holy religion of Death Metal (with influences of Heavy/Thrash/Black Metal and Gindcore). After some changes in the lineup the band consists of Chicken (1984; vox), Lord Crumb (1984; guitars, vox), King Cum (1986; guitars), BamBam (1985; drums) und Mr. Coffin (1983; bass). This was followed by performances together with for example THE EXCREMENTORY GRINDFUCKERS, DEBAUCHERY, TANKARD and STORMWARRIOR. In april 2007 the five erotic gentlemen went into the ‘Soundlodge’ in Rhauderfehn (Ostfriesland). There they were recorded, mixed and mastered by Jörg Uken, the man who worked also together with GOD DETHRONED (Toxic Touch), DEW-SCENTED (Incinerate), TOXOCARA (Imminent Repulsion), SINISTER (The new one;)) and many more. The result of this cool time was the 3-track-EP named “Qagh”, which was released on 15.10.2007. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Splatter+and+Gore+Department">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
