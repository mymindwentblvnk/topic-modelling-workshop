Formed in 2004 and wrote, recorded and distributed (to a limited degree) one self-titled album. It was an experiment of writing metal with melodic/folk/black metal qualities. 

More material has been written, but the band is currently on hiatus so recording/release dates are indefinite. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Elavigor">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
