Assaulter are a  metal band from New South Wales, Australia.

With the guard of S. Berserker on vocals and guitars, T. Hellfinder armed with the ripping of strings on lead and the out-and-out power and precision of P. Hunt (Razor of Occam) on the battering of the skins - Assaulter have just completed their sophomore LP »Boundless!«. Following up from 2008's »Salvation Like Destruction« Assaulter have honed in their sound and style to deliver 8 cuts of ripping metal ode to power, propaganda and proselytism.

The album has been released on CD by Alan Nemtheanga's 'Poison Tongue Records', and on LP by Germany's 'High Roller Records' for 2011.

The band disbanded in December 2012. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Assaulter">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
