Soichi Terada (寺田 創一, Terada Soichi) is a Japanese electronic music composer. He’s best known in the west for his work on the Ape Escape (サルゲッチュ, Saru Getchu in Japan) series. He also composed the japanese version of the soundtrack to the PS2 game Fantavision and the Japan-only game Futari no Fantavision. Prior to his acclaim for video game soundtracks, Terada got some recognition for his early 90's house releases, primarily released on his own Far East recording label. He later diversified into making jungle in the mid 90's, a style he would eventually gain wider recognition for with the Ape Escape soundtracks. 

Some remix work for Akiko Kanazawa in the early 90's eventually led to a collaboration starting in the early 2000's under the moniker of Omodaka, which is a fusion of chiptune and Min’yō (Japanese folk music).

Since the release of the Sounds from the Far East compilation on Rush Hour in 2015, Terada has been enjoying overseas success and renewed interest among the electronic community. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Soichi+Terada">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
