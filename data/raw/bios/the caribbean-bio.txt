The Caribbean are a modern pop music organization. Emerging from D.C. area bands Townies and Smart Went Crazy in 1999, Michael Kentoff, Matthew Byars, and Tony Dennison lay the foundation for the pop conglomerate The Caribbean is today. In 2004, after an EP and two full lengths, The Caribbean, then expanded to a five member group with Don Campbell and David Jones, enlisted the aid of Chad Clark (Smart Went Crazy, Beauty Pill) to produce William of Orange, released on Miami-based Hometapes Records. For 2005's Plastic Explosives, the group again turned to Clark for production duties, reflecting his influence in the liner notes: "Amplified by Chad Clark."

Though spread out across the east coast, The Caribbean continue to proliferate live pop music from time to time in some format or another; they regularly surface as a live trio with Kentoff, Byars, and Jones. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Caribbean">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
