Lethal Attack is a Thrash Metal band from Falun, Sweden. Started in 2003 by the bass player Ante and the drummer Simon. Later on, Martin (guitar) joined the attack, and somehow Olle came along and screamed.
They've made one demo so far, called War Inside and was recorded in 2007.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lethal+Attack">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
