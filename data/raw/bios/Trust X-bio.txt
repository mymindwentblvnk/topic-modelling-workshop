Russian heavy metal band TRUST from Stavropol united with von Juntz, lead singer and mastermind of Decuman Wave (aka Deviatiy Val/"Девятый вал") from Novosibirsk. This also led to the decision to rename the band in celebration of this union as TRUST X.

The renewed band finished the recording of premier album At the Edge of Eternity for release in November 2011 via Metalism Records. The band will showcase the album at shows in Stavropol and Krasnodar, Russia, which will also be recorded for a DVD special release.

Thanks to all for being with us all those days and weeks! We hope you like what we do and we shall do everything we can to bring our songs and shows to you in the best quality. See ya at the show!!! 
Sincerely, TRUST X.
