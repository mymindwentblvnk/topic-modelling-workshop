Sammy “Shmoulik” Avigal a singing sensation who made his name with Dutch bands PICTURE, HORIZON and HAMMERHEAD, later moved to the United States and recorded with THE RODS the album Heavier Than Thou. In 2003 Sammy traveled to Florida to record the album Under A Savage Sky under the banner of Jack Starr's Guardians of the Flame. After the recording of that album he decided to start his own band AVIGAL. Finding a guitar player was a huge task, he auditioned several guitar players but couldn’t find the right one.  While almost giving up he stumbled upon a CD of a local band NO REASON. When he heard Dicky Reome’s playing he was floored. Dicky was just the kind of guitar player he was looking for. Sammy and Dicky got together and AVIGAL was born. Drummer Carl Canedy, a good friend of Sammy’s from the RODS days was recruited to play the drums. On bass the band features Mark Denson. After the recording of the album a decision was made to add a second guitar player to create a bigger sound live Rich Ackerman, a close friend of Dicky was chosen to fill the position.
