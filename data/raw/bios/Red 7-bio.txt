Red 7 was a short-lived rock group formed in 1985 as a side project of Mike Rutherford (Genesis, Mike + the Mechanics). The three core members were Michael Becker, Gene Stashuk and Paul Revelli; Rutheford himself played bass on some of their songs and even sang in the choir on one song, "The Way". The band released two albums; their self-titled debut in 1985 contained arguably their best-known song, "Heartbeat", which was featured in Michael Mann's thriller, Manhunter. Their second album, "When the Sun Goes Down" was released in 1987. Both albums are now somewhat rare as the band lost their contract to MCA soon after the second album and disappeared from public interest (their debut album in particular is very rare as it was only released on cassette and vinyl).
