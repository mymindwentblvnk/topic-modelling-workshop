(1) Just another electronic\ambient\lo-fi project from Moscow, Russia

"Ideal music for the hearing sitting at night at the computer and softly surfing through the web. Nothing excess. Somewhere even it is superfluously primitive, although it is incomprehensible, good this or is bad"

all tracks are written and performed by Stanislav 'Irokez' Rasovsky
