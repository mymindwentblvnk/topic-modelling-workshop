Memphis vocalist Randy Brown had a deep, frequently entrancing voice and captivating delivery, though he never enjoyed major success or consistent hits. The brother of William Brown, a member of the Three Lads, he recorded for Parachute and Chocolate City in the late '70s and early '80s, often doing songs written by Homer Banks and Chuck Brooks, who also produced much of the material on Intimately and Midnight Desire. Brown's lone hit was "We Ought to Be Doin' It" in 1980, which made it to number 16 on the R&B charts. Brown kept plugging, recording as recently as 1988 for Three-Way Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Randy+Brown">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
