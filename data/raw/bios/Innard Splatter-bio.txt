In November 2006, on a messy night on the fuckin' turps, the 3 (now 4 piece) piece brutal death metal act was formed in the boozy shit hole pits of Christchurch, New Zealand. Ever since Innard Splatter has been perfecting their style to represent violence, putridity and torture through chunk fuckity riffs and cunt slamming grooves. 

Innard Splatter will soon make an appearance on a 6-way split with Chumpy Steve, Infinite Defilement, Vaginal Discharge, Guttural Decay & Mortir under Goraphobic Records <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Innard+Splatter">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
