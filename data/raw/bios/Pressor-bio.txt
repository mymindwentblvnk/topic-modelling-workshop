Pressor is a Russian stoner doom / sludge metal band formed in 2010 in Kostroma, Russian Federation.

"Raw aggressive vocals combine with the deeply felt down tuned grooves of a truly sludged up outfit. As it happens despite the heaviness and abrasive qualities the band possess their particular brand of doom rather soothing. Indeed as things progress the band soon unveil their old school doom credentials with a slight Cathedral like weirdness within their melodies."
