Bosco Rogers are the French duo of Barthélémy ‘Barth’ Corbelet and Delphinius ‘Del’ Vargas. Citing influences including "The Monks", "Suicide", "The Gories" and "The B-52's", the Bosco bro’s are the antidote to the bleached-out banalities of earnest introspection and tawdry try-hards.

Dividing their time between Hastings, UK and Rouen, France, where Barth and Del both run recording studios, Bosco Rogers have crafted a debut album, "Post Exotic" that is the very antithesis of these uncertain and shadowed times in which we live. It sits partway between the real world and a self-created sphere of escapist, wild abandon; it is a raucous sprint through half a century of wig-flipping rock music and on into the future. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bosco+Rogers">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
