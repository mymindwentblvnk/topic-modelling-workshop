Hitting the laidback charm of Jonathan Richman square in the chest and mixing it up with a bit of his own carefree California beach pop sensibilities, Sonny Smith finds a way to make your problems melt away like the last rays of the setting sun. Carving out honest melodies but not without a curl of smirk in his lyrics, Sonny's both the wised elder sage imparting half a lifetime of wisdom and the constantly compelling student of life. Curl up with both sides of Sonny; we're pretty sure he'll ease your heart either way.   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Sonny+And+The+Sunsets">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
