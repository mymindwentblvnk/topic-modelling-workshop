Bokor is a metal band from Norrköping, Sweden since 2005.

The band comes from Sweden but they’re way far from your nextdoor generic death/thrash band. They like to mess things up and then put them back together in a new but still slightly disturbing way, yet still accessible. A real must for fans of very unique bands such as Tool, Mastodon, Opeth, Porcupine Tree, Anathema and System Of A Down to name a few.

Line up:
Thomas Eriksson - Lead and Rythm Guitars, Vocals and Backing Vocals
Fredrik Johansson "Lillis" - Rythm Guitars
Lars Carlberg - Lead Vocals, Writing
Rickard Larsson - Bass, Backing Vocals
Erik Wennerholm - Drums and Percussions
