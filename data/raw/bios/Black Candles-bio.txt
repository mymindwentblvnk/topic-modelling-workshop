Black Candles were formed during the summer of 2003 by Fase and Finalizer. The following years along with some slight changes in their line-up and a even bigger one in their musical direction, Black Candles managed to create their own personal sound mixing the Swedish metal legacy with atmospheric and symphonic elements. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Black+Candles">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
