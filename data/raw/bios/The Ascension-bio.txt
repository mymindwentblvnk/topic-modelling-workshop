The ascension. Three figures and a large musical landscape. Formed in January 2008 in the North Western part of England usually erroneously called 'Manchester' by the music press, their music spans different scenery and eras, from the gritty urban to the dark green moorland that surrounds it here – from the 'Factory' era to the present day. Soulful, dense, complex, attacking – joyous melancholic music with basslines to make you run for cover. Broody and moody dark keyboard textures interwoven with shimmering guitars, understated vocals with feeling. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+ascension">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
