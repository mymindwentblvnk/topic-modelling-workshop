mousetrap was formed in May 1988 in Omaha, Nebraska by Guitarist Patrick Buchanan, Bassist Craig Crawford and Drummer Scott Miller. All three were graduates of Ralston High school in southwest Omaha. mousetrap’s early work from 1988 to 1989 was somewhat jazzy and poppy, but was not very mature. The band recorded some material from this period but almost no copies survive. In 1989, mousetrap disbanded to pursue other projects. In late 1990, mousetrap reformed following an impromptu performance at the Antiquarium record store. With the help of record store owner David Sink, mousetrap released their first single, Superkool B/W Fubar, and their second, Wired/ Train on Dave’s One Hour Records label. The later single led to a deal with Grass Records under the Dutch East India imprint. The later version of the band had a much more aggressive sound, reinforced by Buchanan’s wall of guitar sound, his brutal lyrics and Crawford and Miller’s driving rhythm. In 1993 mousetrap released their first full length album, Cerebral Revolver, and in 1994 their second, Lover. The band toured extensively behind both albums, and was noted for their intense live show. Drummer Scott Miller left the band after their 1994 summer tour. Duncan Black replaced Scott and appeared ..trap’s last album for Grass, 1995’s The Dead Air Sound System. In 1995, the band decided to relocate to Chicago, IL, this time with drummer Michael Hogan. Mousetrap recorded an unreleased (officially) EP, and continued to tour until disbanding in mid 1998. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mouse+Trap">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
