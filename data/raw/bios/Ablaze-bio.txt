4) Hong Kong's instrumental band Ablaze.

It was formed in the urban sprawl that is Hong Kong. Its four members create an explosive mix of post-hardcore with sweeping ambient passages beefed up with metallic riffs and rich harmonies.

With years of experience in China, Hong Kong, most recently London and two DIY Ep releases under their belts, Ablaze prove that intelligent and consuming yet catchy and easily accesible music is not out out of the reach of an 'instrumental' band. 

In january 2008 Ablaze released their new track 'digital' for free stream and download.
