Deathfog was a Greek black metal band formed in the early nineties by three friends; Alexis on guitars, Chris on bass and vocals and John on the percussion. They only released one demo in spring '96 and split up shortly after due to personal issues. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/DeathFog">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
