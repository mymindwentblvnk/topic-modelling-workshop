Sethian first saw the light of day in 1998 in the small finnish town of Savonlinna, when two old friends (Wilska and Koponen) started discussing a band, based on good solid music and songs rather than an image. The birth of Sethian was imminent when the band that they both were in at the moment, Nattvindens Gråt (Wilska as the voice and Koponen as the guitarist) broke up.Their first demo (later published on the Black Widow Records compilation ”Not Of This Earth” was made with a couple of old friends, Tuomas Holopainen from NG and Nightwish, and Sami Karttunen (later the drummer of Disco).
The guys were also a part of the heavy metal band Wizzard at the same moment, releasing two albums and touring (and partying) heavily. After Wizzard faded out, time had come to put in another gear. The line up had in the past years had grown with Jalasmäki (then bassplayer) and Kautonen (guitar).
The Dream Domain promo was recorded in the end of 2001 with Karttunen and Holopainen in the studio, and with some help from another old friend, Mr. Kärkkäinen on additional keyboards. Before the studio, as they still had no permanent drummer, the band finally got the brainstorm to ask their old friend Jukka Nevalainen of Nightwish to join them. He answered with a loud ”YES” instantly and the recordings for our debut Into The Silence could begin. The album was recorded at the legendary SundiCoop Studios in Savonlinna by Tuomo Valtonen and later mixed at Finnvox in Helsinki by Mr. Mikko Karmila. All the keys were still played by Mr. Holopainen. The album itself was released in the year of 2003. After the release of the debut album the band is hard at work, rehearsing and working to make it happen where it counts, in front of the live audience. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sethian">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
