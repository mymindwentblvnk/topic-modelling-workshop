Darkblood is a dark ambience/classical inspired project of Mark Howitt from the bands Wolven Ancestry/Amaranth/Fractal Generator.  Inspiration comes from horror movie soundtracks and classical pieces and energies and emotion captured through sound. 

The project began in 2006 with the production of the album "Of Oblivion: The Soundtrack To The Apocalypse", a strange and dark collection of soundscapes. This album was followed by 2007's "A Sorrow Not Felt In Years", which captured Darkblood's signature dark sound. This sound progressed further with the 2008 album "The Emptiness Of Forgotten Existence". Many of the tracks were featured on documentaries which Mark has also created (2012 Revolution: World Awakening, The Formation Of Resistance, Evidence Of Murder).  In 2009, Darkblood created another album entitled "Anthems To Assist In Suicide" which featured tracks from "The Emptiness Of Forgotten Existence" with vocals done by Chloe Jutras, as well as 5 unreleased songs. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Darkblood">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
