Leger Des Heils takes their moniker from the Dutch Salvation Army. They are a mysterious neofolk project which is closely connected to classical music for well over a decade. 

Although Leger Des Heils started off as a purely electronic project, they are including more guitars and other acoustic instruments in later recordings. 

Many of the lyrics are taken from poems by renown German poets, such as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Ernst Moritz Arndt.
