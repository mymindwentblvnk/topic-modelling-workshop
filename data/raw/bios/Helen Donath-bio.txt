Helen Donath (born July 10, 1940) (née Helen Erwin) is an American soprano.
She was born in Corpus Christi, Texas and studied at Del Mar College in Corpus Christi and with Paola Novikova in New York.
She debuted as a concert and Lieder singer in New York. In 1961, she became a member of the Opernstudio in Köln and the Hanover Opera House. In Hanover, she met her husband, the choir master and conductor Klaus Donath.
In 1967, she sang Pamina in Mozart's Die Zauberflöte at the Salzburg Festival, which began a long association with the Festival. From 1970 to 1990, she was a regular member of the Vienna State Opera. She is a sensitive singer with fine dictions, while her evenly-placed voice is clear and sweet. With these qualities, she became an ideal interpreter in the Austro-German lyric repertoire.
She has performed all over the world including at the Vienna State Opera, Metropolitan Opera, Salzburg Festival, Covent Garden, La Scala, etc. In 2006, she had performances as Despina in Così fan tutte at the Vienna State Opera, Salzburg Festival and other places. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Helen+Donath">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
