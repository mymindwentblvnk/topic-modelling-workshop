2. MIO is a Japanese pop singer who is most notable for her contributions to various anime in the 1980's and early 1990's.  Unlike most singers of the time, MIO had a soulful, deeper voice inspired by the likes of Aretha Franklin, Anita Baker, and Chaka Khan. Her husky vocal range caught the attention of King Records, a record company whose artists were often contracted to perform the vocals for Japanese animation opening and closing theme songs, who signed her on in the early 1980's. She changed her stage name in the early 2000's to MIQ as a way of "starting her career over."

3. Mio is a synthpop duo from Kaliningrad. They released "Castles From The Sand" in 2009
