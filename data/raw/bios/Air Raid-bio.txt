AIR RAID is a Heavy Metal act from Gothenburg, Sweden. They were originally formed in 2009 by guitarists Andreas Johansson & Johan Karlsson. After releasing the EP "Danger Ahead" & the Full-length album "Night Of The Axe" with former singer Michalis Rinakakis, AIR RAID appeared at the Keep It True-Festival in Germany, early 2013. This was followed by two smaller tours and festival gigs around Europe.
In the middle of all success, the personal differences between the band and Michalis had gotten too severe. As a result, AIR RAID decided to part ways with him.
Shortly after bringing in new vocalist Arthur W Andersson in July 2013, the band went on a 5-gig Southern European Tour, and also performed two very successful gigs on Japanese Assault Fest in Tokyo, Japan!

The current line-up, including Andreas Johansson (Guitars), Magnus Mild (Guitars), Robin Utbult (Bass), David Hermansson (Drums) and Arthur W Andersson (Vocals), are now working on a new album and will appear on many gigs throughout 2016. Catch them on the road and Raid On!
