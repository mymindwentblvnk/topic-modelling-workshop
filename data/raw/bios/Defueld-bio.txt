Defueld is a five-piece band from Stockholm, Sweden. The music can be described as a mix of contemporary metal and heavy rock with an emphasis on strong melodies, vocal harmonies and heavy grooves.

In November of 2007 they went on tour in Senegal, Africa, performing for more than 6000 people in the suburbs of Dakar. Invited by African promoters, Defueld also held workshops and clinics with famous African artists resulting in a crossbreed of Metal and Senegalese Hip-hop, which came to be known as Hip-Rock. The event got huge attention and was embraced by the national media, calling Defueld’s visit one of the biggest things to happen in the Senegalese music scene in the last 20 years. Additional shows were also performed in front of especially invited press, VIP and embassy personnel, all to the massive cheering of the press and crowd.

In January of 2008 Defueld entered the studio to record their self titled debut album. One of the singles, Forever, is released on the compilation album Mama Trash Family Artists Vol2 by the American based promoter Mama Trash (aka Joanne Sheldon) along with artists like Maryslim, Mortiis, etc. The compilation album will be released on September 30th 2008.

Defuelds debut album contains eleven songs with everything from complete mayhem death metal riffs to heavy metal grooves and soft piano ballads. Simply put something for everyone. The album was recorded, mixed and produced by the band themselves in singer Christoffer Wetterströms professional recording studio Music Solutions Sweden in the southern suburbs of Stockholm, Sweden and mastered at the legendary Cutting Room.

The album will be promoted in Sweden by Per Bussman of Triada promotion, a great partner of Defueld and their D.I.Y way of thinking and working. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Defueld">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
