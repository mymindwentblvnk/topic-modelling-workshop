VHOD (Slovenian for entrance) was conceived by sole member Chris Shaver in early 2014.  VHOD is essentially a merging of Chris's past projects GODCURSED, MORBID DARKNESS and WORMS OF THE BIRTH.  Though those projects are now defunct and will no longer be active, VHOD will continue the musical and conceptual itinerary of those projects as well as introducing newer and more progressive elements. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vhod">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
