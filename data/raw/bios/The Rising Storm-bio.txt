There are two artists with this name.

1.  The Rising Storm is a rock and roll group which was active at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts between 1965 and 1967. The original members of the group were Bob Cohan, Tord Cohen, Charlie Rockwell, Tom Scheft, Tony Thompson, and Rich Weinberg, and later included composer and record producer Andy Paley. The Rising Storm is most notable for their LP album, "Calm Before", which is cited by rock and roll historian Richie Unterberger in the All Music Guide[1]. as being "one of the rarest and most respected garage band albums". Forty years after its recording, mint copies of "Calm Before" can fetch 4 figures among record collectors interested in the garage rock era. The notoriety of this rare album has been the subject of articles in the Boston Globe[2], Boston Magazine, the Washington Post Sunday magazine[3], Mojo magazine, and a feature interview by Liane Hansen on NPR's All Things Considered Weekend Edition.

While still at prep school in the mid-'60s, this New England group recorded one of the rarest and most respected garage band albums, divided equally between outside and self-penned material. This effort was distinguished from many other recordings of the sort not by the respectable covers (of material by Them, Wilson Pickett, Love, and fellow Boston garage bands the Remains and the Rockin' Ramrods), but by their beautiful, haunting original folk-rock ballads. Disbanding upon graduation, they were rediscovered by hardcore '60s collectors over 15 years later, and actually reunited for a live recording at their alma mater in the early '80s. ~ Richie Unterberger, All Music Guide
