Massive Töne are a hip-hop band from Stuttgart Germany, that was formed in 1991 and became popular in 1998 with their album "Überfall".

The four founding members, Showi (Jean-Christoph Ritter), Ju (João dos Santos), Wasi (Wasi Ntuanoglu) and DJ 5ter Ton ("DJ Fifth Note", Alexander Scheffel) all originated in Stuttgart's hip hop scene and modeled themselves at first on the American and French hip hop groups like Breakdance Soundtracks, Beastie Boys, Public Enemy and Ultramagnetics, before they finally found their own style. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Massive+T%C3%B6ne">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
