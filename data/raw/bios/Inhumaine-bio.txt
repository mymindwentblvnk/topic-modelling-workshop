Since 2004, Melbourne’s Inhumaine have been creating and performing extreme metal. Their unique sound incorporates elements of Thrash, European metal and hardcore, all which is cemented within a death metal foundation.
Time has witnessed few changes within the Inhumaine line up. The original creators, Mastema aka magookus (drums) and Navin (guitar) have made subtle changes to form the unified group we know today. With the eventual inclusion of Dave (Bass), Frank (Vocals) and later in 2007 Pat (guitar).
Inhumaine is an Aussie assault, led by dual guitar riffage along with machine gun blast beats, an aggressive rhythm section creating a massive platform for the vocal attack that is Frank’s throat tearing screams and Navin’s thick death growl. 
Inhumaine LIVE are a force to be reckoned with, punishing, hard hitting, unrelenting, tight and intense! 
2007 saw Inhumaine play interstate and record a debut EP ‘War Under a Southern Sky’.
Riding on the success of the E.P., 2008 will foresee Inhumaine film the video clip for the single “War Under a Southern Sky” and continue working the live circuit.
Along with the new film clip and more live shows, Inhumaine will thrive to consistently mature there musical direction and all the while staying true to there brutal roots for an album in early 2009. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Inhumaine">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
