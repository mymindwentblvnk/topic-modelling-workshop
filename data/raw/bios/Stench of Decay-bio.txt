Stench of Decay was spawned in the autumn 2004. Tommi and Rami are the founder members and the idea in its simplicity was to create pure death metal in the vein of old gods. Drummer, Jesse, and another guitarist, Ville, were found rather easily and the line-up was ready for action. Later we found Jussi to take on the vocal duties and so Tommi could concentrate on bass lines. When the demo material was rehearsed, the recordings could finally begin. Result was a demo which included 4 fast and furious songs. After demo recordings we played several gigs in Finland and now we are creating new material for up-coming demo. The next demo will have darker and more obscure atmosphere than the old material.
