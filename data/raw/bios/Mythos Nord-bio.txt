Mythos Nord is a german band formed in 2003 in Stralsund/Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. Their lyrics/themes are inspired by the northern mythology. They released two full-length - Die RÃ¼ckkehr der Krieger in 2006  and Die Segel Gesetzt in 2008.
Their sonically powerful thunder that one can find in their songs offers the perfect combination for some pute viking melodic power metal. Many of the epics of the soulful band are hymns written  in an ecstatic manner that simply come directly under your skin. The last real fight of their lyrics is taking a counter-strike over the globalization and perfidious world-wide americanization and the consequent gradual destruction of mother nature and ancient traditions associated. With a wonderful atmospheric feel, every song has definitely a unique aura.
The subtle sound and all nuances of it, makes their music an ambitious powerful Viking horde hail that will linger under your skin for some time... <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mythos+Nord">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
