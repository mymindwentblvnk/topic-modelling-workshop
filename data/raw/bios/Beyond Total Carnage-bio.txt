Beyond Total Carnage is formed in September 2008 band had a lot of problems and line up changes until April 2009 when Dragan Halavanja(Third Gallery) entered as a new drummer. Then Beyond Total Carnage officially started to work seriously and line up was: Zoran:Vocals, Danilo:Guitar, Vlada:Guitar, Dejan:Bass and Dragan:drums. Band has finished some songs and then after few months Zoran parted ways with band because of his job and school. After one week of tough searching for brutal and good quality vocals we invited Dimitrije(Third gallery,Aheront). For a few rehearsals we finished some songs and some covers! Soon idea to record our songs has born! Thanks to Dimitrije and Dragan and some other friends we have recorded our first EP! Songs are recorded in studio Piknik! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Beyond+Total+Carnage">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
