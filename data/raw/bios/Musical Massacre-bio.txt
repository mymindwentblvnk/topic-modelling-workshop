Musical Massacre is a death metal band from Nossen, Germany.  The band was formed by  Silvio 'Goofy' Zeller (vocals),  André Hase (guitars),  René Kögel (guitars, vocals), Uwe "Limbi" Limberger (bass) and Lutz Göhzold (drums) in 1990.  They played their first gig on August 28, 1991 with Eminenz, Wodan and Lemming Project. They released a couple of demos in the early 1990's, The Evil's Incarnation on November 25, 1991 and Necrobeastiality around October 1992.  Both of these demos were independently released as cassette tapes.  In 1992, Sörko replaced Silvio on  vocals.  Drummer Lutz left the band and he was replaced by Ralph "Olga" Richter.  Musical Massacre disbanded in 1992, then René and Uwe decide to Purgatory the same year.

Founding members Uwe and André decided to reactivate Musical Massacre in the summer of 2012.  They managed to get back their last drummer Richter.  Then they recruited second guitarist by the name of Olaf Gerold and also recruited vocalist  Carsten Sickert.  However, Sickert didn't last that long in the band and was only around in 2012. Then they got  Michael "Keiler" Geyhler on vocals.  In 2013, Richter left the band.  He was replaced by David Beier.  They didn't record any new material during the early years of their reformation, but they got signed to the record label German Democratic Recordings and are still signed to the label to this day.  The band released their first release through a label and they released Necrobestiality (1991-1992) on December 20, 2014.   A compilation that has both demos and rehearsal recordings before the first demo was released.

Around 2014-2015, they work on their first full-length album.  They released their first album entitled Hell Tank 666 on March 14, 2015.  In 2016, vocalist Geyhler leaves and he is replaced by Markus Hartung.  Musical Massacre's sophomore full-length album Off to War was released December 1, 2017.  In 2018, Hartung exits the band.  A year later, he is replaced by Wolfgang Rothbauer (current vocalist to this day).

In 2020, the band decides to release another compilation called Dark Reality.  It contains recordings from 2015 and 2017.  A live track from Rock Is Law 2015 is on the compilation.  Later in 2020, they release their 3rd album  Inhuman on December 11.  Drummer Beier exits the band in 2020.  He did manage to drum on the third album.  It's not known whether he left after the recording it or after the release of it.  In 2021, founding member Lutz Göhzold replaces Beier.  Lutz still drums with the band to this day. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Musical+Massacre">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
