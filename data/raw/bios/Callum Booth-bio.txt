The Man, The Legend!

Members of the artist include Callum Booth.

Musical style is highly varied: as both a classical composer and a member of the alt/indie/disco/metal band  The List Goes On.

As an individual artist, his music is fairly ambient, but fused with an ecclectic mix of metal, hop and lo-fi.

Is good friends and collaborates heavily with the artist Nick Cotton, who together are heavily involved in running the Voodoo Caribou record label. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Callum+Booth">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
