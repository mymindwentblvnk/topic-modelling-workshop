There is more than one artist with this name:

1) Alquimia is a Mexican female multi-instrumentalist and vocalist with a background in electronic and classical music. Her vocal style combines elements of avantgarde, ethnic, medieval, classical and improvised music. Her scores border on ambient, world and psychedelic music.

2) Experimental artist from Highbury Corner, London, England, having a track on the compilation 'Variations A London Compilation'.

3) Heavy metal band from Córdoba, Argentina

4) Last but not least Alquimia is an Argentinian band, who from the beginning, composed their own songs in a very personal style while, at the same time, bearing reminiscences of rock, pop and psychedelic music from the 60's and the 70's (The Beatles, The Who) and merging their music with tunes from medieval- symphonic and Celtic music as well as Hindu rock and even with a wide range of modern musical textures –an actual alchemy  of sounds. Continuing the tendency of non-Anglo-Saxon rock and pop bands (like in Sweden, Germany and other countries), their lyrics are usually in English. They also experiment in Sanskrit, a sacred language of India as in “Rasahaianashastra Shubha” o “Indri Yagrahamam”. Its members are: Pablo Falak  (Bass Guitar and voice), Alejandro "Magic" Langman  (Guitar and voice), Horacio “Fisu” Díaz Braim (Drums), Mariano “The Fan Nº 1” Nogueiro (Guitar and choires)
