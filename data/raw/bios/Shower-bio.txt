Shower was formed in Estonia in 1989 after the dissolution of Varaan, a heavy metal band lead by Tamur Marjasoo.

The power trio's debut demo "Brain Piracy" (1990) has undoubtedly been a big influence for a generation of Estonian metal bands. They disbanded in 2001 but are since reformed (2007) and are currently semi-active, having re-released their two first albums "Brain Piracy" (1990) and "Humiliator" (1992) in the December 2007 and playing occasional gigs.

Their current lineup is:
* Tamur Marjasoo - Vocals, Guitar
* Mart Karu - Guitar (Decease, Echosilence; also did session work for Shower in 2000)
* Sven Valdmann - Bass
* Marko Atso - Drums (Aggressor, ex-No-Big-Silence, Loits, Solwaig, Human Ground, Metsatöll; also did session work for Shower in 2000)

Ex-members:
* Tarvo Valm - Guitar (Flytrap, Misery, Human Ground)
* Eimel Kaljulaid - Vocals (ex-Terminaator, ex-Tanel Padar & the Sun)
* Jaanus Salm - Drums, Percussion
