Rising from 3 parts of the world comes the sick international Death Metal band: HUMAN ENSLAVEMENT. Featuring Dani (Fecal God, Puriform, Drenched, Dysembrioma,...), Dima (Fetal Decay),Michael (Monstrosity, Leacherous Nocturne, Vile), & Jim (Doomsilla, Cystic Dysentery, Bandwhore,...). The debut album brings 11 technical & brutal songs of unrelenting sickness & will be a must have for any underground metal fan. 
HUMAN ENSLAVEMENT was formed in 2012 from the ashes of former Greece cult classic "Human Rejection". The initial intent was to write a new "HR" album with the only remaing member, vocalist Alex. Dani & Jim spent a solid year writing and recording some amazing material, however after the album was written and recorded, Alex was not able to track vocals. So the band picked up Dima to cover vocal duties, and Mike to record the bass guitar. The result is a band that sounds much better than your average metal outfit, with a perfect line-up and the cataylst for a strong debut album.
