Since depart­ing from the humble spaces of the small town where they grew up, the two broth­ers Georg and Nikolaus Nöhr­er have exper­i­enced noth­ing but suc­cess. Using music to express their own growth and explore the mel­an­chol­ic fantas­ies of today’s digit­ally bound youth, the duo behind [country]Aus­tri­a[/country]n band YUKNO under­stand and cap­ture the cur­rent zeitgeist.

Exper­i­ment­ing with the con­cep­tu­al bound­ar­ies of sound, they have sought to elab­or­ate upon the imagery that seems to waft out of their songs and with­in their music videos, which some­times offer rather intense stor­ies, encour­aging a new inter­pret­a­tion with each watch. 

From their ori­gins in their first band Neodisco, this is a pair that is com­fort­able with change. We got the chance to chat with the duo and learn more about their begin­nings, future ambi­tions and per­spect­ives on sustainability. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/YUKNO">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
