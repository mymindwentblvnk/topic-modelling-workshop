Silkk tha Shocker (born Vyshonn King Miller on June 18, 1975) is a rapper from New Orleans, Louisiana and the brother of rappers Master P and C-Murder. He is characterised by his rap style, in which he will rap one line really fast, and the next line really slow.

Silkk rose to fame in the mid-to-late 1990s, releasing records through Master P's label, No Limit Records. His self-titled debut, The Shocker, was released in 1996. Silkk was featured on Master P's 1998 hit, "Make 'Em Say Uhhh!" and had a minor rap hit with his own single that same year, "It Ain't My Fault," featuring label-mate Mystikal. Silkk also performed with R&B singer Mya on the second single released from her self-titled debut album, "Movin' On." In 1999, Mya and Silkk collaborated on the lead single from his album "Made Man." The track, titled "Somebody Like Me," went on to become one of the year's top-selling singles on the Billboard charts. Since then, Silkk has released two additional solo albums: "My World, My Way" in 2001 and "Based On A True Story" in 2004. Neither release generated the same success he enjoyed in the late 1990s. Silkk was also featured on World Wrestling Entertainment's Wreckless Intent album, which was released on May 23, 2006. The song he performed on the album, I'm Comin', has since been used as the theme song for SmackDown! wrestler M.V.P. Silkk also performed former SmackDown! wrestler Orlando Jordan's theme song, Do It Big. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Silkk+The+Shocker">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
