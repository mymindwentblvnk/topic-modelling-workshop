The forceful SHROUD EATER formed January 2009 in the sweltering heat of Miami, FL. The high temperatures must serve as a catalyst for the trio's distinctive cave-man style powerhouse drumming and sub-sonic low end fury, thick aggressive, angular guitar riffs and raw, throaty yelling.  

Within 6 months of their formation, they recorded and independently released a 3 song demo EP (mixed & mastered by Torche's Jonathan Nu√±ez). Drawing comparisons to Kylesa, The Jesus Lizard, High on Fire, Helmet, and others, the EP is being hailed as an unorthodox hybrid of AmRep style noise-rock meets sludgy, stoner-metal fury - a welcome respite from current warmed over cliches, and establishing the trio's style as unique, distinct, disconcerting and massive - a definitive band to look out for in the coming year. 

Shroud Eater is currently gigging in the South Florida area, and are poised to begin recording their debut full-length summer of 2010.
