Iris Divine have managed to defy musical genres by combining elements of metal, progressive rock and pop melodicism. A dynamic rhythm section sets the groundwork for unique vocal melodies/harmonies along with intricate guitar playing which creates a musical landscape sonically charged for fans of hard rock. The band maintains its distinct sound whether playing heavy double-bass driven riffs, simple spacey melodic passages, or challenging odd-meters and poly-rhythms. The band is currently planning live shows for the late summer and fall of 2008. via ~ http://www.myspace.com/irisdivine <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Iris+Divine">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
