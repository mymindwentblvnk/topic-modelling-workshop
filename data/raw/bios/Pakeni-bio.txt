Pakeni were a death 'n' roll (combination of death metal with strong classic rock and rock 'n' roll influences) formed in Turku, Finland in 1992. They released one demo (Virgin's Delirium), where they played classic grindcore, and they moved towards the death 'n' roll direction with their 1996 EP Detergent Bubble Bath. Their last effort was their only full-length, called Celestial Mechanics, released in 1997. They split up shortly after the release. The name Pakeni is a pun on Carcass. The word "carcass" sounds like the Finnish word "karkas", which is the past tense of the verb "karata" (to escape) in spoken language. The verb "paeta" is a synonym for "karata", and its past tense is "pakeni". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pakeni">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
