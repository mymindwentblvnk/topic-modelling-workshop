Ossastorium is a death metal band hailing from Kaunas, Lithuania. Created in the begining of the year 2001 by two 17-year-olds Saulius Rimas (vocals, guitar) and Justinas Vabuolas (bass), they began to walk the path from melodic/goth metal (at the begining) to melodic death metal (with mini album "Per Aspera..." in 2004) and finally to death metal with influences from brutal and technical death metal (with the currently latest album "Inferi", 2005). Their current style can be described as 'technical melancholic death metal'. It's notable, that their lyrics are mainly in Lithuanian, and they sound quite interesting while being growled. 

The current line-up is:

Saulius Rimas (Guitar, vocals)
Justinas Vabuolas (Bass)
SergÄ—jus Lebedevas (Drums)
Rytis Paleckis (Guitar)

The discography is:

Mini album "Per Aspera..." [2004] (Giljotina Records)
Full-length "Inferi" [2005] (Self-released)
Full-length "Expergo" [2011] (Napalm Sound)
