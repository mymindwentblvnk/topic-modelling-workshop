Thrash metal act from Tokyo, Japan, formed in '85. The band released two demo tapes and their first vinyl EP, named "Live at Explosion" in the same year. Their second EP, "A Cradle Song", appeared one year later on the Rock House Explosion label. In '87 the band released a split-flexi with Ground Zero, a thrash metal act from Shizuoka. Jurassic Jade's first 12" EP "War by Proxy" was also released that year. Also released was a compilation LP "Skull Thrash Zone Vol. 1", alongside ＤＯＯＭ, X (pre- X Japan), Ground Zero, Shell Shock and Rose Rose. Jurassic Jade was one of the first bands in Japan to mix thrash with death metal. Their first full-length debut LP "Gore" was released '89 and reissued on CD in 1991 and 2009. Their second full-length studio album "Never Forget Those Days" (Japanese title: "Dareka ga Koroshita Hibi") was released in '91. In the mid-00's Jurassic Jade went from the Howling Bull label, where they released the two albums "Wonderful Monument" and "Left Eye" through, to Bang The Head records. In 2005, the band is celebrating their 20th anniversary by releasing a compilation CD/DVD set "Kuroi Kajitsu (The Early Years 1985-1988)". The band released two more EP's, named "Hemiplegia" (in 2006) and "Endoplasm" (in 2008). Drummer Haya is also a support-member for Chiba's thrash metal act Casbah. Ex-guitarist Kuro was in the early 90's a member of metal act Ｗａｒｐｉｇｓ. Ex-bassist Mataro was also a member of occult speed/doom metal act Bellzlleb.
