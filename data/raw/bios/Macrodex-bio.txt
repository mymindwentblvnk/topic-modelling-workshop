Macrodex was a Swedish death metal band formed in 1987 as Cruelty.  Cruelty had a hardcore sound.  They switched to a death/thrash metal sound and changed their name to Macrodex in 1989.  The first 3 demos were Disgorged to Carrion, Infernal Excess and Remains of a Lost Life.  Then they recorded two songs called "Cremation" and "Worlds of Nothingness" (the title track of their 4th demo)  in late 1990.  They went for a slower sound.  They sounded like a cross between Rottrevore and Autopsy.  "Cremation" was released on a CBR Records compilation entitled Projections of a Stained Mind in 1991.  After Macrodex disbanded due to musical disagreements, some members went on to form Crypt of Kerberos and House of Usher. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Macrodex">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
