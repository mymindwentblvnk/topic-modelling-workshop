Akrasia is a rock & roll band that jams like a jam band but likes to take showers.

They are slackers with guitars and computers riding the vibe of the muse through the tangled webs of this reckless game of Risk, this perpetual game of Othello that is life in this modern age.

Their live shows are a spontaneous, groove-tastic romp through their catalog of around 100 original songs and a bunch of songs that they didn't write also.

Each show is different and special, like a snowflake or a vagina. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Akrasia">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
