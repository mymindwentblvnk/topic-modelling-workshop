Sismo is a musical project based on the idea of highlighting the beauty of simplicity, making emphasis on the importance of having some kind of identity and creating musical proposals that bring out Colombia's cultural values, mixed with electronic music, and visual aids.  These visual aids are presented live, supporting the music.

Music
Sismo was created by Manuel Ignacio Díaz, Álvaro José Buendía and Andrés Velásquez, the three of them musicians, composers and project interpreters.  Later on, Juan Andres Rodriguez became a member of the band, participating as percussionist.

Design and visual arts
Otto Nassar and Juan Camilo Cruz join the band and participate as designers and VJ's.
