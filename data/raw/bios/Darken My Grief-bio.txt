Darken my Grief is a band from Sibiu, Romania. Their genre tends towards a combination of black- death with melodic riffs. They entitle their genre as "Grey Metal"

Having only one demo officially released, songs wander between fans, dc++ hubs, and metalhordes.com downloads. All songs have been recorded in a proffesional metal-recording studio, known among the insiders as "Duddu's kitchen" (which actually is a kitchen).

If you really want to get the taste of DmG, go see them live. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Darken+My+Grief">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
