Miseria Visage is an experimental metal project  from the UK, formed in October 2012. Pairing gothic themes with an amalgam of styles, the band seeks to combine elements of Extreme Metal, 70's Doom, Electro and Progressive Metal in ever intriuging ways, often shifting some stylistic elements with each release.

The project creates around a 'Face of Misery' concept, with 'Visage' representing the face or the self. 'Theta' was originally the solo member of the project, writing and recording every instrument but since 2016 has started collaborating with other musicians.
