Essentially the project of a single man, Laurent Prot, In Aeternam Vale was created in Lyons in 1983 under the heavy influence of punk-rock nihilism, Kraftwerk roboticism and cold, aggressive industrialism.

Bridging EBM, proto-techno and synthesised dark pop, Laurent Prot was making fearless music in the 80s being recently reinterpreted (by the likes of Silent Servant, Regis and James Ruskin) as equally or more important than Detroit’s influence on the current electronic music landscape.

In Aeternam Vale has experienced an underground revival over the past few years. Following a prolific run of low-key tapes spanning back to 1984, his work has been getting a second look via Minimal Wave, Jealous God and other modern imprints. Samuel Kerridge's Contort Records released IAV’s memorable live at Berlin Atonal In Sept 2014.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/In+Aeternam+Vale">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
