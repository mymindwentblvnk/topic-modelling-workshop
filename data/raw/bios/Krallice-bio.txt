Krallice is a New York-based black metal project featuring the guitar work of notorious progressive/experimental metal musicians Colin Marston (Gorguts, Behold... the Arctopus, Byla, Indricothere and others) and Mick Barr (Crom-Tech, Orthrelm, Octis and others), along with Nick McMaster and Lev Weinstein of death metal band Astomatous.

The musical style of Krallice could be described as fairly clean and highly technical by black metal standards, with long, dynamic songs containing some distinctive progressive metal influences. They've been compared to Weakling in some ways, although their music focuses much more on progressive song structures and less on the dissonant droning of Weakling's Dead as Dreams. The band's music has generally been critically acclaimed, and notably, they have released new material almost once a year, with the longest dry period between albums being three years; between 2012 and 2015.

They released a self-titled album in 2008 on Profound Lore Records and a follow-up, Dimensional Bleedthrough, on the same label the next year. Double vinyl releases of the two albums were put out by Gilead Media in 2009 and 2010, respectively. A third album, Diotima, followed in 2011, once again on Profound Lore; a vinyl edition, once again by Gilead Media, shipped around September 20, 2011. An EP entitled Orphan of Sickness was also released in 2011 (for free), as was a flexi-disc single entitled Traditional, which shipped with the September 2011 issue of Decibel Magazine.

The band's fourth album, Years Past Matter, was self-released in August 2012. A vinyl edition released by Gilead Media followed a few months later. The band's fifth album, Ygg huur, was self-released in 2015 (again with a vinyl edition from Gilead a few months later), followed by the EP Hyperion in 2016 (though the material on the latter dated back to 2013). The band's sixth album, Prelapsarian, was released on December 21, 2016, through Gilead Media.

2017 saw the release of the band's seventh and eighth full-length albums in quick succession; the seventh, Loüm, a collaboration with Dave Edwardson of Neurosis, was released on October 27, while the eighth, Go Be Forgotten, was released on November 20. Vinyl editions are being released through Gilead Media; the label's current projected shipping date is January 31, 2018.

2019 saw releases of the EP Wolf; remastered versions of the band’s first four albums with expanded dynamic range, available separately or as the anthology The Wastes of Time; and the live album Rot and Waste Live.

In August of 2020, Krallice released Mass Cathexis, with Edwardson returning once again to offer supporting vocals. 

Despite the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic of 2020, the band continued to release new music, with  Demonic Wealth releasing on March 2021, each member of the band writing and recording the album in isolation. All guitars were written and recorded by Marston, with all vocals by Barr recorded at a swamp. The drums were recorded on a cellular phone and mastered by Marston.

At the end of January 2022, Krallice released their eleventh album, Crystalline Exhaustion. With this album, they experimented with yet another shake-up in band member roles, with Mick Barr taking bass guitar duties, Nick McMaster playing guitar, and Colin Marston manning the keyboards.

Nearly six months later, on Juneteenth 2022, Krallice released the follow-up album Psychagogue, continuing with the new lineup and sound they established half a year prior with Crystalline Exhaustion.
