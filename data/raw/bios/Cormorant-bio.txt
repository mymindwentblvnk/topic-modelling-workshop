CORMORANT formed in 2007 as a trio consisting of guitarist Nick Cohon, drummer Brennan Kunkel and vocalist/bassist Arthur von Nagel, recording a 3-song demo and their The Last Tree EP that very same year. With the addition of seasoned six-stringer Matt Solis in 2008, the band dove into the writing and recording of their full-length debut Metazoa, tracked and mixed by legendary producer Billy Anderson (EYEHATEGOD, MELVINS, MR. BUNGLE, NEUROSIS, PRIMORDIAL, SLEEP). The album launched to overwhelmingly positive reviews, earning them an “Unsigned Talent of the Year” nod from the readers of UltimateGuitar.com and a string of successful shows alongside the likes of JELLO BIAFRA AND THE GUANTANAMO SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, PRIMORDIAL, GIANT SQUID, MOONSORROW, WOE, VELNIAS, GRAYCEON, WITHERED, BLACK COBRA, WOLVES IN THE THRONE ROOM, SUIDAKRA, WOODS OF YPRES, HAMMERS OF MISFORTUNE, HELMS ALEE and SLOUGH FEG. The band released Dwellings in 2011.

Arthur would later leave the band. After his departure, the band would bring on Marcus Luscombe for vocals and bass and release Earth Diver in 2014. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cormorant">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
