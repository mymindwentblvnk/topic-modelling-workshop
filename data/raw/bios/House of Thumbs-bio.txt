Since forming in 2007 from the ashes of other metal bands Isolar and Leechseed, House of Thumbs has become a fixture of the Melbourne metal scene.

The band combines death and thrash metal techniques and vocals with the polyrhythmic patterns and discordant melodies associated with technical death metal, math metal and experimental metal. 

2008 saw House of Thumbs release its debut EP, "Strangle Fiction" to some acclaim and on the back of this they toured throughout regional Victoria. It was on these shows that House of Thumbs developed a reputation for unusual merchandise, unveiling a line of plaster thumb ornaments called the "anti-dice" (and also, the "thumbchuckers").

The band's debut release Crossing the Rubicon was released in March 2010 to a sell-out crowd at the East Brunswick Club in Melbourne. According to critics, the album represented a big step forward for the band in terms of songwriting and production. It was recorded in its entirety by the band, and was mixed and mastered by Ren Reich of Melbourne/Reich Records. The album has been met with positive reviews and press to this point, and the band spent the months immediately following its release playing a string of well-attended gigs throughout Melbourne before touring Canberra and Wagga in May 2010. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/House+of+Thumbs">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
