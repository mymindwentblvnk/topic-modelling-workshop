One band called Caught in the Crossfire, is a 5 piece metal band on a mission. Going against the tide of the current 'core' scene, the boys pride themselves on Hard hitting riffs, well thought-out melodies and overall, music you can headbang to without a too many ridiculous breakdowns. Their newly released EP "leading the blind" is a testament to this, and a major player in the band's ever-growing fan base and reputation. CITC have played with many of Australia's metal and hardcore heavyweights including Mourning Tide, The Broderick, At War With Gods, Bronson, Scar the Surface and Subjektive.

Another band called Caught in the Crossfire is a 5 piece Hardcore/Pop-Punk band from a small town thats just barely on the map called Camas located in Washington and  have released their new EP "Milltown".  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Caught+in+the+Crossfire">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
