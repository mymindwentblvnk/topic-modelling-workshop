Stone Machine Electric is a band from Texas (DFW area).

This thing started in the summer of 2009, not to be confused with the summer of '69.That is a 40 year difference, anyway. One guy had asked this other guy if he was interested in starting up a band with him that went in a direction different from what he had done in previous bands. The other guy had just auditioned for a band that was doing a similar thing to what the one guy wanted to do. 

The other guy agreed to help start the band, with no commitment to stay on as things got pulled together. He was waiting to see what happened with this other band. A week went by, and the other guy was politely told they had chosen someone else. No problem, he could really help out the one guy and see where it goes. 

These two started off with a few covers to get their feet wet with. It came together well, and they both gelled. Of course, it helps that they have played in previous bands together. Now they needed a bassist to bring in the low end.

Finding a bassist is really hard for some reason. After a year of searching and auditioning, these two gave up. "We don't have a bass player, so if you are one that is interested, please send us a message. We got tired of looking for one".

So now we have these two guys playing this mish-mash of heavy psychedelic stoner stuff all over DFW. It seems like this one guy and that other guy know what they are doing, or maybe they don't.
