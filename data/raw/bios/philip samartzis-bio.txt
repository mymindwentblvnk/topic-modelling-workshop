Philip Samartzis is a sound artist and academic based in Melbourne with a particular interest in field recording, musique concrete and surround sound spatialisation. Samartzis uses field recordings of natural and constructed environments as his primary material to render densities of space and discrete zones of aural experience, arranged and mixed to reflect the acoustic and spatial complexities of everyday sound fields. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Philip+Samartzis">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
