Out of the dirty southern Adelaide, Australia, this young band, who are currently 3 piece, play an uncompromisingly technical brand of death metal, drawing inspiration from early Decapitated and Psycroptic, Spawn of Possession and the like. Since 2006 they have released a handful of demo's, gone through some line up changes and now are intent on making a name for themselves, look-out for their brutal new material and possibly an EP somewhere in the works.
