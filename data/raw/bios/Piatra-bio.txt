The basic ideea for setting up this band came together with the desolution of Stih( in the summer of 2000).Lacking former band members ,it was necessary a new orientation, a new beginning: Piatra. It was in 2005, when Bogdan Luparu, Cristian Rangu , Augustin Abitei bas and Marian Iacoban drums started the journey for Piatra. Shortly after, the bas guitarist is leaving the group being replaced by Relu Calcea. One year after it was the drummer to be replaced by Leonard Melis.These two changes generated the actual Piatra formula, a band that approaches a melodic metal, combining gothic, doom elements, together with influences issued by each members personality. And now the drummer is Adrian "Cerberus" of Shadowsong <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/PIATRA">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
