Avagddu is one troubled young man from South Wales with a penchant for funeral-paced Doom, Scandinavian Metal and European folklore and mythology.

After years in the wilderness an invitation to tour with NoFit State Circus was accepted, following which everything went black. Gallons of red wine washed down pills to numb an undefinable pain, notes and curses were scrawled hastily on scraps of paper and skin. Somewhere in the midst of all this Avagddu was born.

The debut album, "23 Cycles Around The Sun" is now available from Disaudio.com <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Avagddu">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
