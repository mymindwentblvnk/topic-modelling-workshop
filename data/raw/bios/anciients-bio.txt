Somewhere between sheer, apocalyptic heaviness and precise riffing, lays otherworldly Anciients—a Vancouver-based rock juggernaut forging crushing heavy metal evocative of veterans High on Fire and contemporary sonic craftsmen, Opeth.

Anciients have combined fuck-off-huge chords with mind-altering riffage that takes you on an unfamiliar trip. Their debut album "Heart of Oak" (available as a download via bandcamp) reeks of colossal harmonies, shattering rhythm sections and distinct, powerful vocals.

This quartet—made up of: Kenny Cook (Lead Vocals, Guitars), Chris Dyck (Guitar and Vocals), Aaron “Boon” Gustafson (Bass) and Mike Hannay (Drums)—started as the brainchild of Cook, hoping to find a more creative outlet for his music. Fully realized once Cook and Dyck’s creative efforts were combined, the band’s line-up solidified and Anciients released its self-titled EP engineered by Shawn Penner and mastered by Stu Mckillop.

Fast forward a handful of impressive shows and praises in local music rags, we now find the group preparing their full length album with help of Jesse Gander at the Hive Studios.
What to expect from the band’s next release? More of the same hard-hitting, meticulously-crafted riffs laced in pungent metal glory. The Hashes of the Pharaohs continue to burn as Anciients revels in its mysterious power. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Anciients">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
