Dauwd was raised in Wales playing piano, guitar and drums whilst experimenting with electronic production. Now, residing in Brighton, his early obsessions with tabliture have progressed into a specific talent for sequencing and creative percussive textures.

Dauwd creates music with a complexity most contemporary producers shy away from. Found sounds are thickly laden over multi-timbred synths, vocal and instrumental stabs punctuate organic and evolving passages guided always by driving percussion and immaculate bass production. The method, “make a noise, make it my noise, then give it some rhythm” certainly seems to work for him. Constantly experimenting, Dauwd describes his creative process as "finding a sound, texture, or moment that you can relate to, and from there develop your narrative". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dauwd">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
