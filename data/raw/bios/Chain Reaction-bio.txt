Chain Reaction started as two friends playing around for fun. Around 2002, these two friends, Piotr Przygoda and Grzegorz Jarek, met with their bass player and drummer, Michał Michalski and Łukasz Konarski. Official date of band's formation, 29th of November 2002 is also a date of their first rehearsal

In 2003, this previously unnamed band adopted, after careful consideration, the name of "Chain Reaction". There was also the first unofficial show - Chain Reaction's first performance at drummer's birthday party. On July, Chain Reaction entered DBX Studio in Warsaw, Poland, to create their first demo, but the recording was interrupted after completing all the instrumental parts. During the last months of 2003, the band was joined by an unknown vocalist named Lucas.

Chain Reaction's first official gig occurred on 13th of February 2004, along with polish bands Hekatomba and Gutter Sinners. Unexpectably, Lucas decided to leave the band next day. With Grzegorz Jarek as temporary vocalist, the band completed "Chain Reaction" and released it 9th of June 2004, during show in "Progresja" club in Warsaw. On 10th of October, Bartosz Szarek officially joined the band. Two weeks later, Grzegorz Jarek left it.

During 2005, band's style was maturing. Chain Reaction played total of 9 gigs all over the country, with bands such as Horrorscope, Archeon, Frontside, Blindead or Corruption. 1st of April was also the date of their first radio interview for Radio Mazowsze. apart from live tours, the band kept working on new material, creating quite a lot of new songs.

Another breakthrough in band's history took place in a time span of three months - April to June. During that time, Chain Reaction recorded the songs for their upcoming promo CD. The "id" is released month later. Despite sending the promo to numerous companies, the band remained unsigned. On September, band earned new member - Daniel Lechmański, guitarist of polish band Exlibris.

During 2007, Chain Reaction kept working on a new, full-fledged album, playing gigs and even scored a country-wide performance in popular TV Talk show "Kuba Wojewódzki" (11th of April). Around September, they have finished recording and released "Vicious Circle" for press interviewers. Since the beginning of 2008, Chain Reaction has been touring all across Poland, playing gigs and selling their album (which was made available on 12th of April and can also be bought by mail).
