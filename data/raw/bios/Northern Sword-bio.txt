Northern Sword is an American symphonic metal band. The band seamlessly creates a sound reminiscent of current Scandinavian metal, combining elements of power, folk, and death metal. Northern Sword's lyrical themes are based upon Norse mythology and Viking lore. The band is currently in the process writing their debut album, Valhalla Bound.
