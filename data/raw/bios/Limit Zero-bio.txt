Limit Zero is a progressive metal band from Bangalore, India. Formed in late 2008 by Shreyas, the project hadn't made any progress until early 2009 when Sachin joined the project as vocalist. Shiv joined the band in early 2010,picking up bass duties while Arjun soon after as guitarist.The line up was finally complete with the addition of Vatsa as drummer in late 2010. The idea behind Limit Zero was to unify various genres and sounds to create one melodic soundscape with a hint of brutality, and a concept that focuses on Space, Gravity and other interstellar uncertainties. 

Their first release, Limit Zero EP, is out now. It is available for free download and for those who'd like a hard copy, they're being made as well. Make sure you get yourself a copy!
