Ovnev is a one man project created in the fall of 2008 by West Maddox. After writing and recording the first demo tracks, the project was put on hold for about 7 years. In 2015 the project was revived and the first demo was mastered and released.

Currently signed to Naturmacht Productions, Ovnev aims to channel the essence of the wilderness. The atmosphere is heavily inspired by the scenic regions of rural America and harsh environments of the north.
