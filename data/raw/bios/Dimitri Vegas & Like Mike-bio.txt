Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike have come a long way in a very short period of time. Sought after producers, remixers to the A-list elite – Lady Gaga, Jennifer Lopez, LMFAO, Pitbull – and #1 hit makers, the accolades they’ve clocked up so far are equal to those some amass in a lifetime! 

Touring across the planet, they are one of the hottest tickets in dance music & grace the biggest venues & festivals with their explosive brand of EDM. Official producers for Tomorrowland, the pair set global charts and radio waves on fire with Tomorrow, The Way We See The World, Rej, Momentum, Generation X, the Stomp EP & more. 

When not releasing on Axtone, Size Records, Refune, Doorn, Wall or Dimmak, to name a few, their Smash The House imprint continues to blaze a trail, & has introduced major new artists like Yves V & Angger Dimas to a new generation of music fans. Breaking into the 2011 DJ Mag Top 100 at #79, 2012 will see them climb even higher following what has been, yet again, another incredible year for the brothers from Belgium... collaborating with artists as Steve Aoki, Laidback Luke, Lil Jon , Moguai and many more!
