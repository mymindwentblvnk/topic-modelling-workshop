Initially growing up more than a thousand miles away from each other, the duo now known as The Blancos fused together at a time where genres were colliding, calling for a sound that had yet to be exposed.

Rooted in the heart of New York City, the challenge to describe two individuals so strikingly similar yet conversely different has become more difficult by the day. They're a musical universe unto themselves, expanding at a nearly immeasurable rate, ever more hard to define - as a forward thinking musical entity that collaboratively creates all music they conceive.

And there's much practice there; The Blancos have been working behind closed doors for the better part of the last decade. Their sound is genre defying, making it impossible to put your finger on what makes "it" so special.

As men of few words, they're quietly grateful that the music they make has resonated with anyone - an experience not all musicians have. And it seems that, in the future music world, The Blancos will be nearby yet hard to find. Because perhaps these young men, who are 25 and 23 years of age, will never fully reveal themselves. Maybe that’s part of the beauty; it’s the music that matters. So behold this grungy dyad; they were never anything but everything. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Blancos">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
