Blood Oath, originally known as Calm Before Calamity, was formed in early January 2005, and originally consisted of three members: Tucker on lead guitar, Jen on keyboard, and Ryan on rhythm guitar. They went through many members before finally emerging with their current line-up.

Blood Oath is currently working their EP/Demo [Bleak Is Beautiful], which is expected in late July. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Blood+Oath">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
