DJ Paypal is a footwork producer. Born in North Carolina, he resides in Berlin. He is a member of the Teklife crew. He has often performed live with his face hidden for reasons of anonymity. His playful moniker and internet-savvy branding hint at a healthy sense of humour, but his music is as lush and soulful as his fellow Teklife producers. As the leader of Mall Music Inc, the label home to peers like DJ Orange Julius and DJ Mastercard, heâ€™s outlined a new take on footwork laden with lush synthesizers and hi-definition sonics, while his work on LuckyMe has pointed towards an interest in soul and disco.
Since 2013, Paypal has toured clubs throughout the world, from Europe to Asia to America, and played several key events and festivals such as MoMA PS1, Low End Theory, Roskilde Festival, and Dour Festival. Live, Paypal is a psychedelic high octane club workout plan. His take on Juke and Footwork is kaleidoscopic and vivid, expanding on the Teklife template for a sound that looks backwards and forwards in equal measure. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/DJ+Paypal">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
