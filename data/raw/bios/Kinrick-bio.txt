Kinrick is a heavy metal band fronted by ex-Firewind vocalist Stephen Fredrick and Vainglory guitarist Corbin King.

The band was put together by producer David T. Chastain with the vocalist and guitarist in mind, and the name is a conglomeration of their surnames - King and Fredrick; Kinrick. The band's rhythm section is comprised of Pagan's Mind and former Firewind drummer Stian Kristoffersen and Zanister bassist James Martin. The debut album, Sense Your Darkness, was written almost entirely by Chastain, with the musicians having little creative input. The members recorded their individual parts effectively as session musicians.
