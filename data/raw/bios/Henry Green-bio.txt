Henry Green is a singer-songwriter based in Bristol, England. His distinctive style is a blend of indie, folk and electronic with melancholic melodies and lyrics.

Following the successes of his EPs Slow (2015) and Real (2017), and his debut album Shift (2018), Henry Green has racked up over 71 million streams on Spotify and more than 18 million on Apple Music, and has won the respect of his peers, including former tour-mates London Grammar and Nick Mulvey, and recent remixers Cyril Hahn and Harvey Causon. And yet, their faith is ultimately repaid with Half Light, the upcoming release that finds Green harnessing that initial crisis of confidence to create music that’s both emotionally honest and breaks new ground.

While tonally intimate, many of the arrangements on Half Light are more expansive than anything Green has attempted previously. “I'm always trying to counteract live instruments with something completely synthetic,” Green says of the process. The fluttering percussion and shimmering synth textures of cinematic lead single ‘Realign’ brings to mind the work of Christian Löffler or Bonobo, both of whom remain key influences in terms of production, alongside long-time vocal reference points RY X and Mike Milosh of Rhye. For ‘Tide’, Green secured a guest turn from another one of his singing heroes, Bonobo and Flying Lotus-collaborator Andreya Triana, while ‘Idle’ features Canadian artist Ghostly Kisses, his label mate at Akira. Alongside strings and a saxophone player, these were the only outside contributors, bar mixing engineer Tristan Hoogland.

Half Light is set for release in June 2020 via Akira Records, with UK, Germany, Amsterdam and France tour dates to follow in September.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Henry+Green">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
