Formally known as Blood of Comrades, MARANATHA hails from Austin, Texas and released their pilot EP entitled "EXANASTASIS" in early 2012. The group is characterized by the various time changes within songs and their ability to squeeze in metal, hardcore and metalcore within a single composition. Splashed in with death-metal influenced vocals and pinch of a djent sound, MARANATHA leaves the listener "heavily" satisfied.
