Bowel Crust is an death/grind/gore band from the Netherlands and started after SMEGMA died. This band can be seen as pre-Rompeprop (singer Steven Smegma formed Rompeprop after Bowel Crust's demise). The only release was a 7" split with Pathology from the Netherlands, released by Lowland Records. The Bowel Crust side of the split was called 'Doomed' <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bowel+Crust">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
