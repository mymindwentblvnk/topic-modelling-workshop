Larrikin Love (formed in 2005) was a four piece indie rock band from London, UK.

Consisting of Edward Larrikin (vocals), Micko Larkin (guitar), Alfie Ambrose (bass) and Coz Kerrigan (drums), and also occasionally including violinist Rob Skipper from The Holloways or roving violinist Jonnie Fielding, the band were one of the cornerstone outfits of what NME named the 'Thamesbeat' scene. They experimented with many different styles of music including punk, reggae, calypso, and bluegrass, and tend to add something of an Irish folk flavour to the typical indie sound. While often compared musically to bands such as The Clash, The Pogues and The Libertines, the band draw many of their lyrical influences from literature, including writers such as Rimbaud, Wilde and Orwell.

After releasing their first two singles on the independent labels Young and Lost Club and Transgressive Records respectively, the band signed to Warner as part of a 'consultancy deal' between Warner and Transgressive. The band released their debut album, The Freedom Spark on 25 September 2006.

It was reported on 4th May 2007 that Larrikin Love had split up amicably.
