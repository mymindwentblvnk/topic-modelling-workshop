KALLITECHNIS, born Cassandra Kouremenos, is a singer, songwriter, dancer, and visual artist from Park Ex, Montreal. Between 2016 and 2018, she released a string of singles and an EP – Wet Paint – from 2016 to 2018 that have spoken to her beliefs and received acclaim from a wide variety of publications.

Released in January 2019, the Chromatic EP is the first page in the next chapter of KALLITECHNIS' career. The Babyface influence is clear, with a passionate 90s R&B energy present throughout its five vibrant tracks. “Colourful” was picked as a single word to best describe the project, and she has encouraged fans to “think about the world through colour” when taking a listen.
