Two bands go by the name of Black Vomit


1. Experimental Psychedelic Black Metal with a heavy electronica influence from Sheffield, England. So far released two splits (with Raperack and Dukkha, also of the True Sheffield Black Metal/Psychadelia attitude), contributed a song to a tribute to VON and a Compilation CD on Rusty Axe Records as well as full length CD, "Jungle Death".

2. Mexican Black Metal band who started in 1991. Has had two releases and is apparently still active. See last 2 tracks below.
