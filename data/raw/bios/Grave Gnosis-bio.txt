Grave Gnosis was born from the ashes of Nahemoth, a one-man ritualistic project from Florida, as four practitioners born of acausal fire came together in order to channel a force incomprehensible by a single human mind.  The expressed purpose of Grave Gnosis is to bestow the experience of ritual and hymn in supreme, transcendent reverence of Death.
