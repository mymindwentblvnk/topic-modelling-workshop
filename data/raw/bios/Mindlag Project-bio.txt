Mindlag Project formed in 1999 in Vitrolles, South of France. The band explores the “mind shifting” concept (hence the name) through dark and vindicatory songs, and a disturbing esthetism.

In 2001, the line-up became stable and the band composed Karybda & Skylla (“Scylla & Charybdis” [en]), a bilogy inspired from Greek mythology, whose symbolic is transposed to present days. Both MCDs were recorded at the All Production studio by C. Carvin, in 2002 and 2004.

At the same time, the band came closer to a local association – the Hybride collective – in order to organize numerous Metal concerts in their hometown. In 2003 and 2004, the third and fourth editions of their Hybride Fest gathered thousand metalheads (at that time, the local Metal scene was quite weak and scattered). Then, this association eventually came to an end.

In 2006, the story goes on: Mindlag Project releases a third MCD, De Charybde En Scylla (“Between Scylla and Charybdis” [en]), transition from the bilogy to their upcoming first full-length album, due to 2007. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mindlag+project">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
