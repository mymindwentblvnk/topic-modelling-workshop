Ergotism is a project that rose from the ashes of Necromanther. The main goal is to continue with the heavy sound of "Between Mankind And Extinction" evolving into a more unique and complex sound.

From now on, all the work will be released under the new name of this project.
There are still some copies of "Between Mankind And Extinction" available at Necromanther's bandcamp if you want to purchase the album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ergotism">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
