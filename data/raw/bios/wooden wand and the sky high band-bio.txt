Many of us have fallen for James Jackson Toth's cracked Americana as seen through dirty sun-baked glass and it's hardly surprising, he offers an oasis in a land of polished perfection, a little bit of unpredictable immediacy in a music scene which tends to favour labour and overwork. 

All becomes clear on hearing the album's opening track - 'Crucifixion, Pt.II', this is not beautiful music, this is the soundtrack to a mescaline fuelled road trip through the lonely deserts of Mid-West, this music is dedicated to the outsider, the bad cop and the lone gunman. It's music for torture, music for sadistic sexual encounter and music for living life to the extreme. I think you know what I mean. Americana which shows the dark underbelly of American society so clearly rarely comes our way, and when it does it rarely reaches such heady heights so let's show our appreciation to Wooden Wand by lighting up a campfire, grabbing hold of a bottle of cheap bourbon and howling at the moon.
