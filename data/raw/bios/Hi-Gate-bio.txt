Hi-gate is the dance music paring of BBC Radio 1 DJ Judge Jules (aka Jules O’Riordon), and Paul Masterson (aka Yomanda, Sushi).

In 1998 Paul send Judge Jules a copy of a track he had just finished, which would later become known as ‘Yomanda – Synth and Strings’. Jules noted that the phone number on the track had the same area code on it as that of Jules, the Highgate area of London. Jules made a call and suggested removing the vocals on the track. Later Jules received the track without the vocals. As a result of Jules playing the track on his Radio 1 show, it was elevated to the top ten, of the UK singles charts.

Following this they decided to start co-producing making the tracks ‘Pitchin’ and ‘Caned and Unable’. The sings saw them appearing on Top of the Pops within the next year. Later ‘I Can Here Voices’, was released, which included the vocals of Jina.

Future work saw them working with Boy George in the track’s ‘Out of Fashion’ and ‘Poverty’, which appeared on their album ‘Split personality’ in 2003. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hi-Gate">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
