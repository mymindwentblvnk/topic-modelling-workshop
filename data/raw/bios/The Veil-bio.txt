There are currently at least five bands called The Veil. Two of these bands hail from the UK, the earliest version being a relatively unknown goth band from the 80s, another a contemporary rock. A third band originates from France, and a fourth from Australia. 

1. The Veil is an 80's goth band from the UK. 'Surrender' is their one and only album they released. As with many female fronted goth bands, the band got easily dismissed as another Siouxsie & The Banshees clone. No wild guitars or tribal drumming here; the music is quite relaxed on this album.

The Veil rose from the ashes of Beast, a cult band that had Bryan Gregory(The Cramps) in it's ranks. Beast released 3 singles of which one is 'Love In A Dying world', a song that also appears on this album.The Veil released one 7", 'Twist/Sway' (both tracks appear on the LP) and two 12"s: 'Manikin' and 'Heavy Heart'.
