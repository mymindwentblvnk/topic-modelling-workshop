Shagnum formed in 1995 and have been slowly grinding out the heaviness ever since. Two demos recorded in 1996 and 1997 captured the band in it's original lineup with Rico on vocals. Simon took on the role of brutal throat destruktor in 2003 and his handi-work can be heard to great effect on the cds 'Shagnum Live @ The Arthouse' and the self-titled recording of 2005. Shagnum toured Tasmania with legendary Melbourne grind-punishers Vaginal Carnage in late 2003 and their all too rare live shows always manage to deliver the unrelenting heaviness that their adherents demand. In 2007 Shagnum supported the mighty Palm and Birushana during their Australian tour including a lightning visit to Sydney. The last two years has seen Travis rejoin the lineup adding devastating heaviness to the live sound. Shagnum played on Grindcore 2009. Shagnum members have also been involved with Birushanah (Osaka) and Dad They Broke Me (Melbourne).
