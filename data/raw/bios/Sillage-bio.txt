Sillage is Brendan Murray and Seth Nehil in collaboration. Certainly amongst our most challenging releases, "Sillage" is the mind-blowing collaboration of Brendan Murray and Seth Nehil and is the result of a first meeting in a live setting from 2004, a performance that was loud, powerful, and very successful. This event combined with knowing these electronic sound artists previous work as generally maximalist and full makes "Sillage" both curious and nearly shocking in this light, as here the material is continually turning inward, trying to push out but always being submerged. This document takes many, many listens and can remain baffling and impenetrable. Yet with patience one does get underneath it, and once this happens the sonic rewards are otherworldly and deep. Followers of either or both artists work should recognize his particular contributions but this venture has provoked new and uncharted territory from both.

Sillage is also a pop-rock band from Moravsk√Ω Krumlov, Czech Republic.
