Headless Crown started in 2011 as a project with the guitarist composer Manu Froelicher and singer Steff Perrone, both influenced by heavy metal bands such as Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Saxon, Accept etc.

In early 2014, the line up was complete with Ced Legger on lead guitar, Mack Machet on Bass and Carlos Bensabat on drums.

In December 2015, the 1st album ''Time For Revolution'' was released by Massacre Records, and well received by the medias and metal fans. 

Concerts have established Headless Crown as a powerful and energetic live act.

Massacre Records has kept their trust in Headless Crown by releasing their 2nd album, ''Century Of Decay'' a dark concept album, on March 30, 2018. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/HEADLESS+CROWN">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
