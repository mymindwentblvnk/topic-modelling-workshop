Ancient Sign Glorify was a lesser-known Brazilian black metal band that existed circa mid-90s and released two demos before splitting up.

Their ex-bassist A. Aguinaga is involved with two bands currently still active: Poeticus Severus and Apokalyptic Raids. There is no record of the activities of the other members after the band's split-up sometime in the late 90s. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ancient+Sign+Glorify">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
