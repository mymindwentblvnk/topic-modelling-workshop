Formed in early 1981 in New Mills, Manchester, as a four piece band, Attak reverted to a trio when their singer left for school commitments. They released two singles in this form, with Lindsay, sister of Mackie from Blitz, being the drummer. A new guitarist was recruited for their album before they split up in late 1983. Gary later turned up in a revamped Blitz and provided the vocals on their "Killing Dream" album. Gary and Lindsay married in 1985.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Attak">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
