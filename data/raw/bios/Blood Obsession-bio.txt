On May 18th 2001, former members of a widely known local band, INTERNAL CRISIS, recruited the bass element, Carlo DAmato, for their sound. Todd Bozek (drums) and Chuck Stafford (rhythm guitar) had finally acquired the tools necessary to put INFANTICIDE (the bands first name) on top. Combining their influences, like CANNIBAL CORPSE and BLACK SABBATH, they were able to produce a sound unique to them, and enjoyed by many.

Shortly after Carlo D'Amato (bass) had joined the band, the search for a vocalist had ended. Erik Rodriquez was introduced to the scene. Through encouragement and practice Todd, Chuck, & Carlo helped him build his vocals & writing ability. INFANTICIDE was complete.

They recorded their first three song demo at Center Stage Productions with the aid of sound engineer Tim Lynch. Copies were distributed at live shows and received positive response. Utilizing the power of the internet as yet another tool for mass promotion, they started a band web page allowing people to download their music and give them feedback. During this time , numerous shows were played at Navigators, Northern Lights, Mother's, and Saratoga Winners.

At a show at Mothers, Matt Geuther (lead guitar) saw INFANTICIDE perform and was impressed by their talent. Within a month, Matt displayed his ability as a lead guitarist and this was the completion all of the members wanted.

After Matt's induction, the band saw some rocky times and survived. Once the smoke cleared, they walked out a different group. More dedication, new material, new name: BLOOD OBSESSION

Then as time went on, 2003-04 brought more opportunities for the band. BLOOD OBSESSION appeared on several compilation CDs in New England, NYC, and Europe. BLOOD OBSESSION played shows all over NY and New England and ended 2004 with the release of their debut full length CD title Death Surrounds.

In April 2005, after the departure of Erik (vocals), and with the addition of Josh Ripper Wheeler on vocals, BLOOD OBSESSION is far more focused and determined than ever before.

BLOOD OBSESSION was finally true and complete in all senses. Combining elements of horror & psychological madness, they blaze the stage, showing utmost regard to detail & peak performance. They are truly a band to hear and witness, but not to ignore.

BLOOD OBSESSION'S music is filled with fierce blasts, guttural vocals and quick off-timing riffs. They are influenced by CANNIBAL CORPSE, NILE, DEICIDE and IMMOLATION to name a few.

A four song demo was released in December 2005 featuring re-recordings of three BLOOD OBSESSION classics plus one new song titled Self - Dismemberment with the current lineup and Matt filling in on session lead guitar.

BLOOD OBSESSION is highlighted in the January edition of BAST Magazine with a review and an ad.

In August 2006, longtime member Carlo left the band to pursue other opportunites. He has been replaced by C. Damien McLaughlin on Bass. With the addition of Brian Fleshman on Lead Guitar, Blood Obsession's lineup is once again complete.

Original member Chuck left in June 2007 and was replaced by founding member Carlo.
