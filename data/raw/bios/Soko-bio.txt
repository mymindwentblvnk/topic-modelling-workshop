There are multiple artists with this name:

1. Stéphanie Sokolinski, in Bordeaux, France), is a half-French / half-Polish singer & actress (called SoKo as far back as she can remember). She has appeared in several French films & got a start as a singer, after she asked a director to sing, on screen.

In 2007 and 2008 "I'll kill her" became a hit song in a number of countries, including Denmark, Austria, Belgium and Australia. At that time SoKo wasn’t signed by a (major) record label. She says; “I don’t want to sign now because I think it’s really rushed.” At several festivals she mentioned an album might be released in autumn 2008. While many believed SoKo to have stopped playing music, in January of 2010 she once again started playing live shows, and writing new material.

January 2011 : She's currently living in Los Angeles, and has just started a new band (or at least a new muscial collaboration)"MachiNette" with Stella Mozgawa from the band Warpaint.
