Solamors arose from a set of concepts: to blend technicality with listenability, to balance intricacy with simplicity, to produce an ebb and flow between darkness and light, brutality and gentleness... and to draw in the listener with familiarity before continually challenging their musical sensibilities to take them on a sonic journey that keeps them engaged while pushing their experience to the extremes and transcending genre boundaries. 

Solamors' debut release, entitled "Depravity's Demise", typifies this approach by engaging and manipulating lyrical and musical dichotomy to produce an experience that tells a story while remaining amorphous. It embraces conceptual and musical symbolism that juxtaposes concepts of dualism with singularity, inevitability with choice and the symbolic with the literal to encourage personalized interpretation and produce a result that is simultaneously expository and equivocal in form and content.
