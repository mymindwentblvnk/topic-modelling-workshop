PRODUCTIONS
Formed in 2004, Starlight Extinction have professionally recorded their first album “Twilight of Darkness” in 2009. The album was produced at the Majestic Studio in Scorzè (Venice) where other bands such as Delirium X Tremens (death metal) and Talco (skapunk) have recorded. Twilight of Darkness was released by Bunker Productions, chosen because it best describes the power and melody of the music.
