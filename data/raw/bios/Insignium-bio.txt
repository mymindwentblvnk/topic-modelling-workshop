Insignium is a black metal band formed in 1996 located in Hagen, Germany. The founding members are Shoggoth and Apollyon. Their style can be described as melodic black metal with certain death metal elements, somewhat akin to Swedish band Naglfar. The music is usually played in mid-tempo. The lyrics primarily deal with "typical" black metal topics such as death and evil - however, the band does not explicitly promote an Anti-Christian message. The lyrics also seem to be influenced by H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu mythos. For example, the founding members' stage name Shoggoth is a reference to the fictional creature described by Lovecraft. The band is currently signed with Black Attakk Records.
