With all the Rage (W.A.T.R.) born in Palermo (Italy) in September 2010 from an idea of the guitarist Vincenzo Ciolino and the singer Luca Cirrito, their idea was to create a band that reflects their state of mind, or better yet their way of life.

With all the Rage contains in the name the deeper meaning of grudge fed by the guys towards Sicily, a land stained by the conspiracy of silence and bigotry: ANGER.

In September 2011 With All The Rage recorded their first album "Yesterday ... Now ... Tomorrow ... Ever", the album was produced by Ajeet Gill at "Hellfire II Studio Recording" in Birmingham. The album is published by SG Records in 2012. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/With+All+The+Rage">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
