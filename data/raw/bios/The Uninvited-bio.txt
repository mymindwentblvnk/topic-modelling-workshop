2. Formed around 2002 in sunny Doncaster originally under the name Malebolgia. After playing a few gigs and recording their first demo "Rough Justice" they started to make a name for themselves in the local scene. Primarily influenced by sludge and hardcore sounding like raging speedhorn and orange goblin the band recorded an EP, "Contrary To Popular Belief..." with Ian Wetherell at Premier Studios. This CD included the classic tune "Donny Hardcore" which started the band on their more hardcore path. The band had also decided to change the name to The Uninvited.  the fellows toured with Sheffield instrumentalists 65 Days Of Static after which they self financed their first album Dire Island. Unfortunately due to the inevitable creative differences the band split shortly after recording this.
