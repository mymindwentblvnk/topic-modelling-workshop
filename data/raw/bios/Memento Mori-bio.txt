At least ten bands have gone by the name of Memento Mori:



1) Memento Mori was a Swedish doom metal band with power metal influences. The band was founded by Messiah Marcolin and Mike Wead in 1992 after Messiah left Candlemass. The sound can be described as a mixture between Messiah's former band and Wead's other band Hexenhaus. After two albums Messiah however called it quits and the third album was sung by a different singer. For the fourth album, Messiah returned. After that album, the band broke up. All albums have been released by Black Mark. (from their wikipedia entry)

2) Memento Mori was a band from Livingston, New Jersey, that can roughly be described as experimental indie rock. The group released one album, entitled "Is One Worth The Other?", in 2004, and broke up shortly after. The drummer, Christopher Han, went on to form Agents and Reactants. The other four members now play in The Amateur Photography.
