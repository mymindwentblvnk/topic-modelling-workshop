Solo project by John Gill (Black Tribe and various other bands)

The name "Alpha Drone" is taken from a science fiction short story inspired by Aldous Huxley's "Brave New World" John Gill wrote at a younger age. The name symbolizes the superiority of theozoological eugenics attempting to restore man's divinity over modern "bee-hive" genetic engineering attempting to increase man's economic productivity.

Alpha Drone was first formed as a follow-up to Black Tribe, but the latter was kept going as a side-project for playing raw old school Black Metal occasionally. After the growing success of Black Tribe's new, raw style (and its growing line-up), both are now seperate entities of equal importance.
