After many changes of line-up and name, Talion –originally founded by Benjamin B. (Guitar), Benjamin N. (Guitar) and Max (Drums)- grows at the beginning of 2006 with the arrival of Olivier (Singer).
A few months later, the members of the band complete the line up while choosing Tristan as their bassist, and decide at the same time to change the band’s name in order to underline this new start; Talion becomes The Sons of Talion.
After numerous rehearsals and some gigs in their area, the members of the band decide in May 2007 to record their first 5 tracks EP. In July 2007, they put their demo online, on their myspace page. The 5 tracks get a good reception and this confirms the band’s idea to go even further in their musical world where melody and aggression are the keywords.

At the beginning of 2008, the guys lock themselves in their rehearsal room in order to write their first album.
In August 2008, The Sons of Talion go in a recording studio with Kevin Pandele from Wavium Studio to record 10 tracks of a metal both traditional and modern, where thrash, hardcore, death, black and heavy meet.

Their first album, released in October 2008, is entitled  “And the Sky Opened”.
