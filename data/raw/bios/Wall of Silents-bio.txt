Wall of Silents is a "swamp metal" band from Palmerston North, New Zealand.  

  They have released two albums so far, the Demon Demo 5 track EP in 2004 and then a self-titled, 9 track album in 2005.  Only the song "Overthrown" does not appear on the album.

  They play gigs fairly often in the lower North island, and drummer Aaron is also in Neckstretchers, another Palmy Metal band.

  There have also been rumors of a new album in the works, to be released in mid 2008. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wall+of+Silents">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
