The new name of the band Reading Rainbow 

They play music so rich and saturated in reverb and bright, sun drenched psychedelia that it will make your headphones sweat like a cold soda can in the summer time. Simple pop melodies, repetitive rhythms, and short, sweet and to the point.

Bleeding Rainbow is a Philadelphia-based band that was originally composed of singer/bassist Sarah Everton - also the drummer when they played as Reading Rainbow - and singer/guitarist Rob Garcia, though now the group has expanded to include drummer Greg Frantz and lead guitarist Al Creedon.While still performing as a duo, Everton and Garcia released two full length albums under the name Reading Rainbow, Mystical Participation, and Prism Eyes on HoZac Records. The band's third release and their first under their new moniker, Yeah Right, sees the band signing to Brooklyn-based label Kanine Records and embracing "bands from our teenage-hood." On February 25, 2014, Bleeding Rainbow released the full length titled "Interrupt". 

On April 5, 2015, Bleeding Rainbow announced on their Facebook page that the band had decided to call it quits. The split was amicable, and the members are all focusing on new projects. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bleeding+Rainbow">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
