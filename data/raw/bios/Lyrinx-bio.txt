Lyrinx is a metal band based in the UK.  In an interview, Lyrinx's founder describes the band's music as 'nihilistic metal'.  The band's percussion and vocals tend to be characteristic of black metal, and 'Nihilistic Purity' includes several tremolo guitar sections.  Nonetheless, the band's most recent release, 'Ending the Circle of Life', features two long songs (in the range of 15 - 20 minutes), with a slower tempo and far more bass than is characteristic for black metal music.  Lyrical themes are generally based around the philosophical position of nihilism and include in particular considerations of existential freedom, social dissatisfaction, social isolation, loss of hope, and suicide. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lyrinx">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
