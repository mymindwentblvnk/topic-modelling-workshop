Till The End is a German Metal Band formed in 2005 with the name Myrkvid by Andreas Helde and Patrick Banholzer. The Name Myrkvid was changed after a few months, because it didn't fit the musik. So they changed it to "Till The End". Due to they knew no Drummer they started without drums until they met Peter Schulz who should do the Drums. On a party Andreas and Patrick asked Manuel Kolloff to play the Bass in the Band and he wanted to try... Manuel had fun playing the bass so he stayed.

In the first weeks of november 2006 they started some demo recordings. One song of this demo you can listen here at last.fm. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Till+The+End">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
