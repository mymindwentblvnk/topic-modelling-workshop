The Folk-Metal-Band „Caverns of Arnosh“ was founded by Dennis Schwachhofer (Drums) in February 2005. Contrary to all expectations, the four players of exotic instruments such as violin (Ruth Mair), bagpipe and flutes (Fabian Wiescher), mandolin (Manuel Trzcinski) and accordion (Solveig Rose), were the first to join the project. 
After a long search the wildly desired e-guitar player Michael Grabow finally came the band’s way. But another six months had to pass by until Sebastian Haag (electric bass) eventually completed the band. 
Shortly after the new entrant’s joining, “Jolly Roger” was recorded at BS SOUND studios and became the band’s first single track. 
Since there were numerous technical problems during practice, which might also have happened at concerts, Christoph Schramm, sound engineer, was finally recruited and put an end to them. 
The tough efforts, the merciless, hours-lasting rehearsals and the members’ iron willpower were at last rewarded with their first concert at “Schwabhausen’s Kulturspectaculum” on June 30th 2007. 
At further concerts, Caverns of Arnosh presented a mixture of self-written songs and arranged Irish Folk. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Caverns+of+Arnosh">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
