Rock Plaza Central is a Canadian indie rock band. Their independently released disc, Are We Not Horses (2006), made many top ten lists for the year, including #8 for CMJ Editor-in-Chief Kenny Herzog, Pitchfork staff writer Stephen Deusner and Americana-UK lead writer David Cowling.

They are often compared to Neutral Milk Hotel and Will Oldham.

In early 2007, they received additional attention for their cover of the Justin Timberlake song "SexyBack". 

Rock Plaza Central is now signed to Outside Music in Canada and Yep Roc Records in the US.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rock+Plaza+Central">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
