Martin Carr (born 29 November 1968, in Thurso, Scotland but raised in Wallasey on the Wirral), was the chief songwriter and lead guitarist with the British band, The Boo Radleys.

Carr is an ex-pupil of St. Mary's College, Wallasey Village, and played an early gig with The Boo Radleys at 'The Grand' nightclub in New Brighton.

Since the break up of the band, Carr has launched a solo career, taking the name bravecaptain from a song by the U.S. rock band, fIREHOSE. His solo work has largely been more electronic based than his previous work, and mainly features himself on lead vocals, whereas in The Boo Radleys he rarely sang (despite writing the lyrics). He is known for his varied taste in music, including loves of jazz and hip-hop, and an interest in electronic experimentation, ensuring that the Boo Radleys soon moved past their shoegazing roots.

In 2008, Carr announced that he had recorded a new album in Cardiff with producer Charlie Francis and a few 'friends'. Martin Carr told music website The Quietus about his plans to release the album via the Bandstocks scheme. 

By the start of the following year Carr had abandoned the Bandstocks project, later commenting to music industry website HitQuarters that "it needs a lot of work and commitment to try and find investors and I couldn't offer either." Instead he released the album 'Ye Gods (and little fishes)' in July 2009 on his own new imprint Sonny Boy Records, using the company State 51 for distribution.
