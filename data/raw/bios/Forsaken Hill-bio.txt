Forsaken Hill is a Death/Folk Metal band from Preetz, which was founded in 2007 by Guitarists Thiemo and Tristan. On their Quest, they received great support by bassist Tyll and drummer Tennard. But first, the four had to find their true way of music, which finally happened after numerous experiments. The early album 'Beyond the Veil' which doesn´t comply to the Band´s actual style of music worked as a demo then. Finally, several successful concerts encouraged songwriter Tristan to compose more mature and worthy titles, which are still part of the Band´s current setlist. Nowadays, Forsaken Hill combines pure Death Metal with Folk elements and intoxicating choruses. Previews can be heard on the 2009 promo songs 'Path of Liberty' and 'In the Forest'. Temporary, the Band is working on the release of their first album, allthough Bassist Tyll left the Band due to musical differences. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Forsaken+Hill">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
