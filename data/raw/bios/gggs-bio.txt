GGGS is a one-man disco-cybergrind band started by RedSK (based in Michigan) as a joke back in 2006. A small collection of songs recorded through the years 2006-2008, remastered in 2009 have been assembled and compiled to be released on a small collection entitled "Spandex Slaughter". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/GGGS">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
