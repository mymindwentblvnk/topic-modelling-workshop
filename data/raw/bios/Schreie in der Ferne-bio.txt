Schreie in der Ferne is the solo Depressive Black Metal project of A.B. from Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany. The project started in 2008 and released the demo "So schwindet Hoffnung" in October on tape through "Schwarzton Records", limited to 100 hand numbered copies. 

A.B. changed the band name to Raging Avenger in early 2009. Next to the changed name, A.B. also started to play more raw and agressive black metal instead of the depressive black metal from Schreie in der Ferne.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Schreie+in+der+Ferne">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
