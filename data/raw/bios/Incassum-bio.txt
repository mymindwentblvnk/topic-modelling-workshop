After initially forming at Salford University in September 2004 the band wrote and recorded their first demo quickly and recorded later that year, and began gigging around the live scene in Manchester, England. They quickly captured attention with their progressive, technicaledge and aggressive female vocals. The graced stages all over the Northwest throughout early 2005, which also saw them spread their wings further, heading across the border to Edinburgh before settling in to write, and consolidate their sound from itâ€™s tentative beginning.The band recorded another demo in mid-2006 with Mike Pilate( formerly of Malefic & Collusion, currently in The Ocean). At this time original guitarist Jim Knights (now in Wakefield death metallers Nailed) decided to leave the band amicably and was promptly replaced by a friend and fan of the band, Chris Taylor.

2007 has seen Incassum play at Manchester Academy 3 with the likes of i-def-i, Nailed, I Remain & Blood Vigil and many more dates around the Northwest to further consolidate their name. They band headed into MCC Studios in February/March 2008 with producer Andy Giblin(Kill II This, i-def-i, Nailed, Profane, Slipknot, Napalm Death etc), to record their debut EP. With the band graduating in May 2008, tours and gigs much further afield are a definite goal and the release of their new EP will cause a ripple in the metal scene.
