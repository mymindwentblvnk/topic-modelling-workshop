Free Energy is a Philadelphia, PA band formed in 2008 which includes Scott Wells, Paul Sprangers, Evan Wells,  Sheridan Fox, and Nick Shuminksy. Wells and Sprangers were both in now-defunct Hockey Night. Free Energy broadcasts melodic, hook-laden rock tunes with a heavy dose of bombastic glam and classic dust. 

Where the similarly hook-tastic Hockey Night was reminiscent of Pavement and Truman's Water, Free Energy shares more similarities with the heroes of old: Thin Lizzy, Cheap Trick, Boston, Fleetwood Mac,Bruce Springsteen, La Dusseldorf and pretty much every beloved rock band from the canon of classic rock radio. "The Energy," which they are not commonly referred as, draw their inspiration from the deep well of sweet a.m. radio water.

Via blog posts on both Hockey Night and Free Energy Myspace pages, they promised “more news, shows, a limited DFA 7” single, videos, a mockumentary, recipes, safety tips, sound legal advice, sure bets, and where to go for the best deals.”

Nicky STTX, the drummer, can currently be seen in the hit viral youtube clip "WoodTalk with Nick Shuminsky."

Free Energy was initially signed to DFA Records. James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem produced Free Energy's debut record Stuck On Nothing, which was released March 9th, 2010. Free Energy released their sophomore album, Love Sign, on January 15th 2013, under their own Free People Records after being dropped by DFA.
