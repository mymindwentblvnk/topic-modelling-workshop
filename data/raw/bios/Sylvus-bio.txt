Sylvus is a black metal band from Ontario, coagulating in the latter half of the first decade of the third millenium. A few demos and a mini-album have been released since their formation and gradual transformation from folk/black metal to a more straightforward black metal style with the 2011 demo, "The Beating Of Black Wings." A full length album was released at the end of 2013, "Upon The Onyx Throne." The band has since gone on hiatus.
