Broken Melody was formed in April 2006 from the dissolution of a former band. With the arrival of the new guitarist and consequently with a new line-up and a well-defined musical direction, in the first few weeks of existence the group set out on a series of concerts and acoustic events to promote their new sound and propose something new to the general public. The group�s real baptism of fire was on Arts Day in Piazza Itala (Sassari). Today, Broken Melody is concentrating on the recording of their debut album, preceeded by an EP which will serve as a forerunner to the album itself. In August 2006 the group took part in the Montrestate Rock competition in which it came second and closed the concert season. In January 2007 the band started the recording of the EP �If You Want Fly�, and in February, well-charged and highly motivated, they started to plan the new concert season.
