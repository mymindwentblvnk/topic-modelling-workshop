Death metal band from Denmark, formed from the ashes of Church Bizarre in 2008. They played discordant mid-to-slow tempo death metal. They went on hiatus in 2013 shortly after releasing their debut full length album on Hells Headbangers records. The vocalist and lead guitarist have formed a new band Dwell and members of Cerekloth have also revitalized Church Bizarre.
