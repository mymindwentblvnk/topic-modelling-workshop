2012 - present
Started as a music project for fun by ex-members of such Russian rock and metal bands as Stemfade, One Glimpse Away and k0k0n, 7 Dot Dice quickly grew into a powerful Stoner Metal / Southern Rock quartet that immediately proved to be a serious band that should be heard globally. It took them less than 6 months to get ready with 7 songs and put out their debut self-titled EP that was mixed by Daniele Nelli of the band “Tasters” (Italy). EP got positive feedback from all over the world within several days after the release. While the EP is being spread on the Web, the guys are getting ready to shoot their first official music video and go on tour in order to support their release and showcase the Modern rock music worldwide as they see it. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/7+Dot+Dice">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
