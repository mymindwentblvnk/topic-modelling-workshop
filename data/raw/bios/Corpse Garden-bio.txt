Corpse Garden has been shattering tranquility and wreaking havoc since their inception in 2009. The five-piece, extreme metal act from Costa Rica, Central America has been assaulting eardrums and banging heads over the past six years with their form of death metal.

With influences ranging from Morbid Angel to Deathspell Omega, Corpse Garden isn’t afraid to experiment with a traditional death metal style, bringing in black metal influences and instruments such as the eBow and Mellotron to create both ambience and an often-haunting musical atmosphere. 

Having already shared stages with the likes of Disgorge [Mex], Morbid Angel [USA], Malevolent Creation [USA], Behemoth [Pol] and Mnemic [Den] amongst others, the band are intent on spreading their music to new ears and territories with their upcoming second album release. In 2012 Corpse Garden battled against almost 90 bands in the Central American leg of the worldwide Wacken Metal Battle competition. The band went on to win and represented the region in the final of the battle at Wacken Festival, Germany. 

After recording a demo in 2011, the band hit the studio in earnest with producer Juan Pablo Calvo of Bushido Audio Productions, Costa Rica, to bring their debut album, ‘Burnt By The Light’ [2012], to the fore. Mastered by the one and only Jens Bogren [Opeth, Katatonia, Bloodbath, Amon Amarth] of Fascination Street Studios, Sweden, the band garnered great reviews and plaudits the world over with the release.

Following a three-man line-up change in 2013, the band took almost a year and a half to compose the follow-up, entering the Bushido studio again in 2014 to produce and mix their second full-length opus. Taking the band in a different direction towards a more atmospheric sound, the beastly offering ‘Entheogen’, as it has become known is set to breathe life on 15th May 2015 with a release through both Satanath Records, Russia and Rebirth The Metal Productions, Germany.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Corpse+Garden">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
