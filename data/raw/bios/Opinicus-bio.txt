The last year has been a combination of writing, fused with local gigging. Two recent line- up changes have brought renewed vigor and direction to the fore. Opinicus are now back fuller, larger, louder and ready to assault your senses.

Named Best Unsigned Band of the Month (RockTube TV 2008), the website still contains their video, directed by the bands own Jesse Armstrong under the moniker Strongarm Media (www.myspace.com/strongarmmedia) Opinicus also caught the attention of music moguls at Roadrunner Records. The band have recently taken up an offer to be promoted by Valium Management, (www.myspace.com/valiumpromo) a Salford based music management company, Opinicus hope to promote themselves countrywide bringing them a larger fan base.
