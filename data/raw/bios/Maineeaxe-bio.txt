A York based Metal band dating back to 1981 under the name of TRANS-AM. There was a brief period during the mid 80s when Maineeaxe looked likely to break through into a bigger league in the wake of a Brit Metal revolution, but success unfortunately eluded them.

Originally a female fronted outfit TRANS-AM, made up of guitarist Dave Stewart (previously with Punk Rock outfit CYANIDE), bassist Ian Simpson and drummer Paul Cordoc. The band enlisted former FLIGHT and BULLDOG BREED (The band that featured future UK SUBS drummer Steve Roberts) singer Mick Adamson during 1984 to record a projected album.

Adamson's previous act FLIGHT had released two Pop-Rock singles in 1974 on BASF Records; 'What Am I To Do With You' and 'It's Only Money'. FLIGHT featured Kevin Nixon, who was to found Powerstation Records, the label that offered TRANS-AM a deal. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Maineeaxe">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
