Aboriscor was founded in August 2007 by Max and Anto, under the name of Symphonic Dolls at that time. They were quickly rejoined by Alison as guitar player, Flo as bass player and Kevin who was the singer. The band evolved around death metal. In September 2007, the decision of dismissing Alison was taken, her remplacement by Antoine was decided and this one stayed nearly one month. In November 2007, J-P became integrated into the band as guitar player. After a demo’s recording in February 2008, they decided to separate from Kevin. The singer’s places followed one another until the arrival of Bastien, who offered to the band an indisputable work on the present compositions. In April 2008, the name changed into Aboriscor. The recording of a new demo at middle June put the style on black/death metal, with numerous well-known influences. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Aboriscor">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
