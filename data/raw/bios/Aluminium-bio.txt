Aluminium is the name of a music project based upon an orchestral reworking of the music of the band The White Stripes. Its members are Richard Russell and Joby Talbot. Jack White, of the White Stripes, has endorsed the project.

Rob Jones has also produced an exhibition of artwork based on the album.

The album, of avant-garde orchestral music, was originally conceived by Richard Russell and Jody Talbot. After working on some tracks - including "Aluminium" (the White Stripes' original from the album White Blood Cells retained the American spelling "Aluminum"), "I'm Bound to Pack it Up" - they presented the work to the White Stripes in Cincinnati.

Following White's penchant for the number "3", only 3,333 copies of the CD version have been produced, along with 999 LP's. In addition to this, the album is available on unlimited download. [2] The album was available for pre-order on November 6, 2006 and fully released on November 13.

The music was recorded by a specially selected orchestra. Part of it has since been used by choreographer Wayne McGregor in a production for the Royal Ballet. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Aluminium">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
