Toxic Ritual are a three piece thrash/punk crossover band from Leeds. They formed in Spring 2012 after meeting through a series of sketchy internet ads and have recently began gigging. Their sound draws influence from bands such as Municipal Waste, Dr. Living Dead, DRI and Anthrax and features songs about mutant cephlapods, radioactive serial killers, getting messed up in the pit, and Mario Kart, because 'why not?'. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Toxic+Ritual">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
