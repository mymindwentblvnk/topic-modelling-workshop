Parris, who is originally from Cardiff, has always had a passion for music and started to take it more serious at the age of 19, where after a period of staying with his uncle, who introduced him to Garage band, he found a love for music production. While studying Music Production and sound engineering in Bristol, he also found his voice. Parris then decided to move to London with a hope to achieve his dream of becoming not only a recognised singer but to also have the opportunity to write for others within a range of genres e.g R&B,POP, DANCE.

Parris, whose full name is Ashley Parris, grew up listening to the likes of Usher, Destiny’s Child, Aaliyah, Dru Hill and more recently Drake, Trey Songz and Chris Brown. Parris counts these great artists as his musical influences and some of these can be heard in his music today. Parris’ sound has been compared to the likes of Frank Ocean and The Weeknd, in which he regards as an achievement in itself. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Parris">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
