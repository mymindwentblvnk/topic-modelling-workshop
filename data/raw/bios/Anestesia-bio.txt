Hardcore / Thrash band with ultra political lyrics formed in 1988 in Zarautz, Basque Country. They didn't release their first album "Gorrotoaren ahotsa" (Voice of hate) until 1993. Mikel Kazalis, their lead guitar player became very active on side projects like 2Kate, Negu Gorriak, or Kuraia, so after their 4th release on 2000 the band dissapeared from the scene, wich made of them a cult band. On 2006 They came back with a very awaited new release: "Terapia".
