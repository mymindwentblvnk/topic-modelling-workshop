Kirt, Anthony, Todd, and Dave: The members of Lords Anointed
The day this band formed was sometime in early January of 2008. 

Lords Anointed brings to you an assault of heavy melodic music with a balance of complexity and simplicity. 

Every single song written by Lords Anointed goes through a tedious evaluation before they consider it completed. They aim to make sure that each song is complex enough to the point where you don't know where the music will go but yet simple enough to where you will have their music stuck in your head for days to come.

Lords Anointed hopes to be a breath of fresh air to the music scene. In a time where musicianship is lost within songs that take one day to write and don't make sense, these guys are here to change that. They are here to provide killer tunes and riffs that will get your adrenaline flowing. 

On stage Lords Anointed showcases their raw energy and pure, good fashion, entertainment guaranteed to get you out of your seat and rockin' like everyone else. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lords+Anointed">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
