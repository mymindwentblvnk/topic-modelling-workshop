Braddock is a Belgian rock band. They put out two releases in 2009. The first was a 7" EP called Show Bunk Some Love. It's the 1st volume in a series of live & raw recordings that don't fit on a full-length, or that demand a release of their own. Abrasive hardcore dementia & lo-fi blues. The other kind of blues. 

Right at the end of the year, they released BUF, the first full-length album released under the Braddock moniker. Whereas the 7” represents the near-chaotic live mania the band conjures up, the album is a more focused affair, recorded and mixed by none other than Xavier Carion of Channel Zero-fame. At Studio Jonathas, Carion also succeeded in capturing the intense/insane energy and brick-hard sound that drives the band. 10 songs about love & hate at ear bleeding volume.

"There's enough spineless, conformist, over-produced stuff around to fill your rooms, attics & basements with. Too many bands can't deliver on stage what they promise on record. We're not willing to play that game. This is a New Primitivism, aiming straight for the gut. Broken songs, damaged sounds. And words? Words don't even matter, words are merely tools." 

"One guy said we sound like The Jesus Lizard doing Napalm Death songs on the 7". Somebody else said the music makes no sense at all. And that’s okay as well. There are probably hints of High On Fire, Oxbow and Black Flag in our sound. If you listen carefully. "
