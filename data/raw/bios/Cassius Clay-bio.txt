Muhammad Ali (born Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr., Louiseville, Kentucky, January 17, 1942 â€“ June 3, 2016 ) was a heavyweight boxer and three time world heavyweight champion. He is widely considered to be the greatest heavyweight boxer of all time and one of the most famous and recognizable sports figures of all time.
In 1963, Ali released an album of spoken word on Columbia Records titled I Am the Greatest, and in 1964, he recorded the song "Stand by Me".

Before he became involved in the Nation Of Islam and changed his name to Muhammad Ali, Cassius Clay released an album entitled "I Am The Greatest" in 1963. This album was a spoken word recording of his infamous pre-fight poetry, most of which was written to promote his fight with, and intimidate, former opponent and (at the time) world champion Sonny Liston (who is mentioned by name several times during the recording). Recorded in front of an audience with a backing band and an additional vocal cast, the album also included a radio play - which featured Clay as a heroic dragon-slayer - and two single songs with Ali on vocals, including a cover of Stand By Me. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cassius+Clay">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
