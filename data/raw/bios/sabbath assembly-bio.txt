Sabbath Assembly is the brainchild of No-Neck Blues Band/Boadrum lifer Dave Nuss (here, XTIAN) and Jex Thoth (here, JEX), the band formed in 2009 in New York.

Album Restored To One pays homage to and expands/reworks the apocalyptic purification hymns of the Process Church Of The Final Judgement.

On the second album Ye are Gods Jex Thoth was replaced by Jamie Myers as vocalist. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sabbath+Assembly">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
