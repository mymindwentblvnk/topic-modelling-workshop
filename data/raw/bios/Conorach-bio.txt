Conorach is a Power Metal band from Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Their music combines the energy of Metal with the melodies of traditional European folk music into an explosive mix with a progressive touch. As modern bards, their lyrics tell tales of historical adventures, epic battles and the merits of individual heroes. This leads to a combination of elements that will appeal not only to fans of traditional Heavy Metal, but also to fans of a more modern sound.

Conorach released their demo, entitled “A New Day Rising” back in 2006. After a period of many gigs their first full-length album “Tales from the Tavern” was released in 2008. In 2010 the free downloadable EP “42 Days/Patriot Song” was released.

The band is known for its energetic and dynamic shows. Since 2006 they have shared the stage with renowned acts such as Rage, Freedom Call, Lord Volture, Roadkill, Heidevolk and Eluveitie. Furthermore, the band has twice played a fully acoustic show.

After a successful tour in Czech Republic and several gigs including Occultfest, Conorach released their second full-length album "Through the Ages" on the 7th of March 2014.
