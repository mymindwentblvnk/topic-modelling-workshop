Elmsfire was founded in 1999 in Düsseldorf, Germany by guitarists Germano and Doro, and hit stage for the 1st time in 2002. Their music being a mix of trash-, power- and heavymetal dominated by melodic guitar-riffs and combined with lyrics originating in classic literature and mystics Elmsfire created their own unique style. Playing countless gigs in and outside of Germany and dealing with a number of line-up-changes Elmsfire recorded two demos and one E.P. which ultimately  formed the steps towards the release of ther first “real” album in 2010 entitled “Thieves of the Sun”. The album contains 8 tracks performed by Ross Thompson who kindly lent the band his voice.
“Thieves of the Sun” was recorded at Spacelab Studio Oedt under the direction of producer Christian “Moschus” Moos and was mastered at “Mastering Ranch” by Eroc, drummer of the german classic rock band
Grobschnitt. In 2014/16 several line-up changes took place so that the band currently finds itself complete with bass-player Marcel, drummer Paul and singer Lukas about to release their new album 'Hour Of The Wolf'
