Having been on the alternative Bristol music scene for just over three years, the 21-year-old songwriter/producer has become a sought-after singer and multi-instrumentalist with a steady flow of releases.

Inspired by artists ranging from Mount Kimbie, Louis Jordan, Delia Derbyshire through to FKA twigs Harvey deftly coerces Jazz, Dubstep and Electronic genres. Based in Bristol his work recalls early Massive Attack and 'Portishead records, while the interaction between vocals and digital production points towards Moderat or Radiohead' (Clash).

A thoughtful and considered lyricist, Harvey finds inspiration across themes of philosophy, physics, and architecture. Growing up in Buckinghamshire, Harvey’s depth and integrity came from a creative childhood, his father a musician and his mother a dancer performing in a Mexican circus show in her younger years.

Having previously supported the likes of Maribou State and Loyle Carner, Harvey Causon has become a memorable live performer, with remarkable attention to detail and a beautifully touching live vocal. Causon has had strong radio support including an ‘Artist Of The Week’ nod on BBC Radio 1, Huw Stephen's 'One to Watch' and a Maida Vale session for BBC Introducing. With a larger body of work expected over the coming months, 2020 looks to be an exciting year. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Harvey+Causon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
