Rest in Darkness was formed at the end of 1996 by three friends with a common passion for extreme metal: Sandro Capellini (guitar/vocals), Daniele Torelli (bass) and Cristian Minonne (drums).  The band's early sound retained a classic death metal style influenced by the major bands of the genre (Obituary, Napalm Death, Morbid Angel, et al).  After two years R.I.D. began adding melodic and somewhat epic riffs to the speed and heaviness of death metal, thus developing its music into a hybrid of death and black metal.  Rest in Darkness pairs its deep musical roots with introspective and personal lyrics in order to recreate in musical form the darkest feelings of the human mind.  
Due to various reasons Rest in Darkness never entered a studio in its first decade.  Only in November 2007, after persistent rehearsals and live shows (most notably in 2005 as support for legendary Italian act Necrodeath) was the first demo recorded! The title Abyss of Death is taken from the eponymous track, which became quite famous in the underground thanks to a highly acclaimed live-recorded mp3 of the song posted on the band’s website.  The other tracks -- “The Blood of My Enemies” and “The Dark Rest” -- complete this brief aural portrait of the band.
