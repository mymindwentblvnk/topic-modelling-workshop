Southern Chugg Rock from the liver of New Zealand.

Gary Churr and the Beers came together after Gary Mervin Churr met with a bunch of fucken pisshead blokes at the Wainui tavern (later known as the beers) , they all had an interest for southern fucken chugg music , drinkin beer and having a darn good motherfucken time.

They started out procastinating and doing a whole heap of bloody fucken nothing , jamming every few months and thrownin up on each others fucken ratshit shit-stained carpet , until they discovered they all had something in common , the nack to skull real brews, not that god damned mother fucken 4% shit that tastes like the back of my fucken balls but the shit that knocks you on your mother fucken ass and wants you beggin for fucken more and the fucken nack to write darn good ol' bloody chuggen fucken music.

An album is currently in the works to be released early 2009 and a few concerts are gonna happen so hold ya fucken dirty undies and keep a blurry eye out for the shit comin your mother fucken way!!
