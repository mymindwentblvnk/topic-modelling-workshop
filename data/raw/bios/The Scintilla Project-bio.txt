The Scintilla Project is a super-group fronted by SAXONâ€™s own Biff Byford (vocals).  Other members include 
Lionel Hicks - drums
Anthony Ritchie - bass
Andy Sneap - guitar

The band was inspired by SCINTILLA, a science fiction thriller is set deep underground in the wilds of a former Soviet state where strange genetic experiments are taking place. A war weary mercenary is hired to lead a company scientist to the secret underground laboratory and with his team of mercenaries to steal the research in the laboratory. Along the way the good people face dangerous militia involved in a bloodthirsty civil war, strange monsters lurking in the abandoned tunnels of the old Soviet bunker and finally they meet the scientist running the genetic experiments and her terrifying secret.
