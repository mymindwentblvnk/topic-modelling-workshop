Massenhinrichtung (The band's name in translation from the German "mass execution"). Founded in the end of 2003.
At first it was a one-man project by Ksaltone (later A.E.O.N.). But in 2005 the band joined Hresvelgr and the band became a duo.
Under the name "Total Disaster" was recorded first demo "Latent Malice", consists of a raw black metal with some melodic influences. Soon it was recorded another demo "Until Your Death" (2006), which is markedly different from the first. Music has become a bit more complicated, more melodic and softer.
After recording, the guys decided to change the name to "Massenhinrichtung". During 2007 have been recorded two demos, which contained re-recorded old songs and some new songs.
"Disburden On my mind" (2007) and "Go Beyond Gist" (2007) were combined in a single disc under the title "Go Beyond Gist". Also in the release it was added 2 bonus tracks, one of which is a cover of the legendary "fathers" Celtic Frost.

The first full-length release "Go Beyond Gist" came out in late summer of 2008 on the famous Polish label East Side Records. This CD contains 7 tracks of melodic black doom metal + Celtic Frost cover.

At the turn of 2010-2011 joined the band bassist Narg and guitarist Stogn (2015 RIP). 
From 2011 the band started concert activity. During this period the band radically changed the sound and found their own unique style.

In 2012 on the Polish label EastSide Records released split with another Belarusian black metal band Raven Throne called "Adzinota Kruka".

In March 2015 on the German label Darker Than Black released their second full-length album called "Zakon Zbroi". This is a concept album dedicated to tragic and terrible events of the Second World War on the territory of Belarus.
After the end of recording the album the band was left Stogn. To replace him joined the band A\Vesh.

In January 2016, the band presented web release "Naŭski Dzień". 
After that the band announced that in 2016 a band are waiting for the changes in line up and some style changes.
