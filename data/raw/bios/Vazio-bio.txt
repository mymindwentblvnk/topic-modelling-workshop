1) Black metal band started at november 2016 in São Paulo, Brasil, formed by members of Armagedom, Social Chaos and Pr4g4. https://vazio.bandcamp.com/

2)Vazio formed mid-1999 with the intention of changing the concepts of traditional music to play a form of "anti-music". At their gigs they would show films of explicit deaths amongst other irregular things "the human mind is capable of". The band supposedly only had a secondary function, making soundtracks for the films exhibited, so people could reflect on the true meaning of those films.

The original line-up consisted of Heuler Rocha (drums), Mauricio Campos (guitar), Flavio Santiago (bass) and MC Lord Magrão (vocals/guitar). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vazio">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
