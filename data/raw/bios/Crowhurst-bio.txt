Crowhurst is an experimental project founded in Philadelphia in 2011. Led by Jay Gambit the project started as a noise project who's recurring themes included collaboration (both live and remote) as well as terrifying soundscapes. In the years since, the project has touched on a number of genres such as black and doom metal - alongside the traditional textural compositions.

In 2015 vinyl reissues of the sold out Chondritic Sound cassette 'Aghoree' and 'Memory Loss' were released in conjunction with Sol Y Nieve Records. Later that year the album No Life To Live was remastered by Today is the Day's Steve Austin. 

That year, Gambit and friends released "I" which was engineered and produced by Jack Shirley (Deafheaven, Punch) which was a departure from more noise oriented releases. In the summer of 2016 the project released the followup "II" which was written alongside members of Caina and Aevangelist. The effort was produced by Keith Souza and Seth Manchester (The Body, Daughters) at Machines With Magnets. 

2019 was a breakout year for Crowhurst with the release of their Kurt Ballou produced album "III" heralded by a string of festival appearances including Austin Terror Fest, Damnation Festival (UK), Prophecy Fest NYC, Days Of Darkness (USA), Steel Warriors Rebellion (PT) and two sets at a sold out Roadburn Festival. 

The project has released over 75 albums and has been praised by outlets such as The Needle Drop, Vice, Popmatters, Revolver, Decibel and Metal Hammer and has collaborated with everyone including Gary Mundy (Skullflower, Ramleh), Gnaw Their Tongues and Eugene Robinson (Oxbow) amongst hundreds of others.
