Originally formed under the name "Slay the Shepherd" in 2010 by founding members Asmus Høyrup and Adel Haley, they're based in the middle of Denmark with roots in various areas of Denmark and Baghdad. Experiencing some inevitable lineup changes the band has finally come to a steady point consisting of Adel Haley on vocals and guitars, Asmus Høyrup on drums, Esben Dueholm on guitars and Jakob Goul on bass.
Having already released one demo EP during their time as Slay the Shepherd they released another EP almost immediately after the namechange. In early 2012 Rapid Dominance was participating in the Danish leg of the Wacken Metal Battle and began playing gigs regularly until bassist Jakob Goul quit the band during fall 2012. 2013 saw the band writing their new album which was recorded, mixed and mastered through the entire year for a release in 2014.
