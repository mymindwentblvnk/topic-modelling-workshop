O Wretched Man is a heavy metal band amalgamated carefully with different genres of extreme metal. O.W.M. bursts forth with elaborate guitars and bass coupled with vigorous drumming and vocals that give tongue to shrieking screams and bellowing growls speaking forth truth in a sea of lies.
 Though considered a Christian band by some, when front man Jonathan Baron was asked the question, "are you a Christian band?"  Baron is quoted as saying, "We fully believe in the scriptures and all songs are based on them, as well as the fallen human condition. However we adhere to no religion or sect other than adhering to the Messiah.
  O Wretched Man's current line up consists of vocalist Jonathan Baron, guitarists Colton Kain and Caleb Clark, drummer Brandon Tranter, and bassist Mikee Harper.
