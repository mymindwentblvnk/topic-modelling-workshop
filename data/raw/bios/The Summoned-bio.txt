Known for their intensity in both their music and live shows Boston based experimental death metal band The Summoned is being considered as fore-runners in the New England metal scene. They've been referred to such bands as Between The Buried and Me, The Faceless and Black Dahlia Murder but that doesn't stop them from experimenting with their sound but maintaining the intensity they're most known for. With Steve Thompson on Vocals, Jake Kelleher and Shaun Murphy on Guitars, Greg Mann on Bass, and Sam Hang on Drums The Summoned believes they've collectively brought out all their seperate influences to create their own vision of experimental death metal.

In a span of two years The Summoned has completed two east coast tours, played shows in fifteen states and has had the honor of opening for national acts such as The Faceless, Dying Fetus, Beneath The Massacre, Through The Eyes of the Dead, Carnifex, Suffokate, Blindwitness, The Demonstration & Killwhitneydead.

The release of their 2009 demo recorded in May over a period of three days with Berkley School of Music student Fred Sladkey, The Summoned believes this is their best work to date. With two east cost tours, an EP release, a demo release, endorsements, opening for national acts as well as radio air play under their belt The Summoned has proven that their hard work with song writing and live shows strikes a nerve. Praised by their peers and highly acclaimed responses from fans The Summoned has no intentions of slowing down but picking up the pace to maintain their status of fore-runners in the New England metal scene. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Summoned">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
