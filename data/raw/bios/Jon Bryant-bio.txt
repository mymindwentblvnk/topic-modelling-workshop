Jon Bryant (born 22 January 1986) is a Canadian singer-songwriter based in Halifax, Nova Scotia.

Since releasing his debut album and receiving nation-wide exposure through itunes, Bryant has toured relentlessly throughout North America. After a successful first year, (ECMA, Music Nova Scotia and Covenant award nominations and three cross Canada tours) 2011 proved to be the first step towards a very bright future. 

Described as like a watercolor painting, Bryant's music is beautiful in its melancholy, strength and character conveyed through nicely contrasting styles. His live set aims to hit spiritual and often comedic highs as well as sweet, somber lows. Bryant actively tours throughout Canada. His full length follow-up album entitled "What Takes You", was released in 2012. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jon+Bryant">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
