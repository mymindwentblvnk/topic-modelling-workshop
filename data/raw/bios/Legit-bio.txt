[2]  A defunct Seattle, WA, USA, hardcore band (circa 2004-2005).

Sites:  MySpace.

[3]  A 21 year old emcee born and bred in Chicago, IL, USA. Being an avid fan of hip-hop music and culture, Legit was strongly influenced to start rapping during his freshman ear in high school. Legit offers a unique sound of soulful beats mixed with lyrical poignancy influenced by wordsmiths such as Lupe Fiasco and Eminem. With a clear cut mastery of diction, delivery and flow, Legit brings conscious substance with inherent wisdom seemingly beyond his years. In July of 2011, he released his most cohesive body of work to date titled "Coloring Outside The Lines" and has showed no signs of slowing up ever since. He released a video from that same project for a song called "A Nigger in Northface" which pushed the envelope discussing interracial dating. That video went viral almost immediately after its release, garnering over 100,000 views in just a few months, landing him on websites such as Worldstar Hip Hop, 2dopeboyz, This is 50, The Source, and Illroots to name a few. Currently, Legit is releasing a new song every week to hold fans over until his new project releases, which is expected sometime during the 4th Quarter of 2012. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Legit">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
