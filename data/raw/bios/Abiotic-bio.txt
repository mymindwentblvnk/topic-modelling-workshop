1) Abiotic is an American technical death metal band from Miami, Florida. The five-piece group are signed to Metal Blade Records and consists of vocalist Travis Bartosek, bassist Alex Vazquez, drummer Brent Phillips and guitarists Matt Mendez and Johnathan Matos. The band released their debut studio album "Symbiosis" October 22nd of 2012 and are currently working on new material. 

2) aBioTic was intended to be a mix of techno hardcore, punk and metal.
JB was listening to Thunderdome and Terrordome compilations at the time, and also had a punk phase so he tried to combine naive teen angst punkish lyrics with techno hardcore bassdrums. Later he tried to put some metal samples also, mainly Rammstein and Marilyn Manson.
Because of limitations of software sampler (HammerHead Rhythm Station) that he used at the time songs did not came out as he intended, but some turned not so bad.
But you`ll be the judge.
Project lasted from 1998 until 2003.

3) Drum & bass producer from Sevastopol, Ukraine.
