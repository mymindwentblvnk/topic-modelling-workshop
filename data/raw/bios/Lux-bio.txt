7) A Glasgow based band, born from boredom of disappointing indie & bland nights out, Lux decided to form a band bringing together a style rife with grooves and hooks that'd make your granny wanna shake her old ass, with lyrical content coming from a lifetime of misadventure and stupidity we have crafted a style of music to engage our audience in as many ways as possible. Whether it be something you said to some chick in a club or just pure lies you told to get laid, we have pretty much covered it all.

11) Punk band from Barcelona.
Not unlike contemporaries such as Exotica or even Exit Order, Lux fuses UK82 style pogo punk with the interesting rhythms of anarcho punk. The catchy basslines are super loud in the mix and drenched in chorus, bringing a gothy sensibility as well.
