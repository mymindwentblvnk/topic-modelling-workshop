Ex Models were formed in 2000 in Brooklyn, New York by Shahin Motia, Shahyar Motia, Jake Fiedler and Mike Masiello.  After releasing the Talking Heads-esque Other Mathematics in 2001, they took a brief break while members attended college.  Adding a new bassist, Zach Lehrhoff of The Seconds (featuring Brian Chase of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs), they released a split 7" with the Seconds and 2003's Zoo Psychology, a genre-bending, ring-modulated album of Devo worship.  In 2004 Shahyar and Jake left, leaving Shahin and Zach to move in a new direction, influenced by Einsturzende Neubauten.  2005's Chrome Panthers EP is indicative of their new "fundustrial noise" sound, with loops and drum samples provided by members of Oneida, specifically Kid Millions who sometimes drums with them.
