Members Kool Keith, Ced Gee, TR Love and Moe Love released their debut album Critical Beatdown, produced by Paul C., in 1988 and inspired the world of hip hop with their original sound of unorthodox sampling, polysyllabic rhymes, and bizarre lyrical imagery. 

Kool Keith went on to work with many other groups and solo projects including The Cenobites along with Godfather Don, Dr. Octagon,  Masters of Illusion with Motion Man and Kutmasta Kurt, Dr. Dooom and Project Polaroid with Bay Area producer TomC3.

Their work has been often sampled, most notably in  The Prodigy song "Smack My Bitch Up" <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ultramagnetic+MC%27s">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
