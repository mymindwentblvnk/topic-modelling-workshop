Victims of Internal Decay is an old school death metal band from Albany, Oregon in the USA. Formed in 1988, they released three demos in three consecutive years, 1989, 1990, 1991 and released their first self-titled album in 1993.  Their fourth demo Resin 67 Sessions was released three years after.  Due to the fact that guitarist Terry Geil has only one leg, the band adopted the unusual phrase "Death on Nine Legs" as a motto. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Victims+of+Internal+Decay">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
