Formed in Oslo in 1996, Black Comedy went on to receive first place in the National Championship of Rock Music in 1998. Whatever that is. Still, it's gotta be better than not winning it.

The band have three demo packages under their belts, 'Insult/Injury', 'Post-Neurotic-Fixations', and 'Crawl to Exceed ', and, one EP, 'Synthesis (EP)', released on Angel Productions. They release 'Instigator'  in 2008.

Black Comedy plays a futuristic and digital sounding form of “hard” metal also containing keyboards.  The band wants to create music representing an eclectic, combination-package that only can be labeled “Black Comedy”. I'd be likely to call this form of style: 'Cybermetal'. 

The Band members are: 
Jon Bergan - Lead vocals 
Marius Strand - Guitars & Vocals 
Stefano A. Bardellotto - Guitars 
Bjørn M. Borg - Keyboards 
Tjodalv - Drums 
Marius Haraldsen - Bass <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Black+Comedy">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
