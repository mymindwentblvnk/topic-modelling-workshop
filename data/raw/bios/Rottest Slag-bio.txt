ROTTEST SLAG started as a hardcore punk band named Angoixa when the band members were about 16 years old. This would change in 1990 when they changed  their musical direction to a more grindcore-oriented style with death metal elements. In 1992 they released their sole album so far, Let Us Be Corrupt. The band has reunited in 2012 and plans to re-release their full-lenght are up as well as releasing material written after the release of their only record.
