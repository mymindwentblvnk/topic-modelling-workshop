Desmond Cheese - the pungent product of a long term collaboration between two finely aged producers, Makcheese and Desmond Bagely. These Brissie beatsmiths are out to change your perspective on hip hop, dairy products, and life in general.

Their sophomore release 'SPACE & TIME' is out NOW!

Both albums available at www.desmondcheese.bandcamp.com

The boys pay homage to a broad base of influences, from Zappa to Boards of Canada, from Dilla to Debussy, from Marley to Madlib. Their product is a constantly shifting musical landscape, where no two jams are ever the same and each performance is created in the moment, for the moment.
