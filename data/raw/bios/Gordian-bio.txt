The history of Gordian reaches back to year 1997 when the first version of the band was found by Mika Musakka and Kimmo Kujansuu.
In 1998 Miika Viljamaa (Ahti) joined the band and a year later in 1999 Joni Kouki came along as well. At this point the band was known as Dethtone.
In the year 2001 Ville Virmala became the bass-player and the name was changed to Chaos Overture. On 2nd of february 2002 the band played in Nurmi-metalfest as a warm-up band for Omnium Gatherum, Ensiferum and Finntroll.
And after Nurmi-metalfest Kimmo left the band. To replace him the band found a man called Jukka Saarinen. And at the end of year 2002 Tomi "Raato" Ruohoalho joined the band as a keyboardist.
