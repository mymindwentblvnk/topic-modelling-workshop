There are two bands by the name Challenger Deep. (1) An Atmosphereic Metal band from Minsk and (2) an instrumental 4 piece from Atlanta.
(1) Challenger Deep is an atmospheric metal band from Minsk, Belarus in 2009. The band comprises vocalist Anton Bondarenko (ex-Frequence Diversity, Mulct), guitar-player Anton Berezovskiy (ex-Anna Coralie, ex-Frequence Diversity, Roddone), Alexander Stepanenko (Marie Chante) on the second guitar, drummer Sergey Golovach (ex-Ronin Diem) and bass-player Evgeniy Danilov (ex-Ronin Diem). As for now the band has released two full-length albums, expanding their musical borders from early atmospheric post-hardcore and post-rock riffs to later melancholic multi-layered metal songs, yet maintaining unusual style with rich instrumental part and powerful, aggressive vocals.

After three years since the release of the first album entitled «Our Own Prisons» (Dominance Records, Self-Released) and many shows and hard studio work, Challenger Deep has released it’s space album «Irreversible» in April 2014 on independent label «TRVS Records». Putting huge conceptual efforts, it took almost 2 years to complete and represent the picture of a melancholic face of destructive human activity, which destroys each piece of light on it's way.
Challenger Deep is an uncommercial band, which is always open to all people without racial, sexual (and etc.) prejudices.

The band is currently working hard on new material for the upcoming album and planning to go an European tour in Autumn 2015.
(2) Challenger Deep is an instrumental rock four-piece boy band out of Atlanta, Georgia for fans of artists like The Fall of Troy, Protest The Hero, Chon, Polyphia, Plini & Intervals. Their latest release, The Stuff of Legends" released Oct. 29th, 2021.
