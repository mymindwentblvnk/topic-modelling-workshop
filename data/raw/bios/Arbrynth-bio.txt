Arbrynth are a folk inspired metal band from the outer east of Melbourne, Australia. Drawing from a vast array of influences, Arbrynth have developed a sound that reflects the colour of folklore, woven with their heavy metal roots.  The result of this unlikely combination of darkness and light is a style of music which takes the listener on a journey of love and loss, set against a backdrop of nature and earth. The atmosphere in Arbrynth's music is refined through a combination of distorted guitar driven riffs, epic leads and acoustic guitar melodies all intertwined with relentless death growls and ethereal male/female vocals and harmonies. As a four-piece sharing vocals and character portrayal, Arbrynth have a versatility that breathes new life on the the storytelling in their music.

Mid 2011 saw the band enter the studio for the first time to record their self-titled debut album. This independently funded pursuit has been the culmination of many years of hard work for Arbrynth and hopes to create many exciting opportunities in 2012.
