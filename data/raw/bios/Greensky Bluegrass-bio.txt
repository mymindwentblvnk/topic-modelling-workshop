Greensky Bluegrass is a five-piece American bluegrass/rock band founded in Kalamazoo, Michigan, in mid-2000. The band has evolved over the years, growing from 3 to 5 members and describe their sound as "their own version of bluegrass music, mixing the acoustic stomp of a string band with the rule-breaking spirit of rock & roll".

The band was formed in the fall of 2000 by Michael Arlen Bont (banjo), Dave Bruzza (guitar), and Paul Hoffman (mandolin), who initially played together at an open mic night. As newcomers to the bluegrass scene, the three drew upon an array of influences and varied musical backgrounds, reflected in their May 2004 release of Less than Supper. 

In the summer of 2006 the band were winners of the Telluride Bluegrass Festival Band Competition, earning them a spot on the main stage of the 2007 festival. Soon thereafter they released their second studio album, Tuesday Letter. 

In September 2016, Greensky Bluegrass released their album Shouted, Written Down & Quoted. All For Money was released in 2019. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Greensky+Bluegrass">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
