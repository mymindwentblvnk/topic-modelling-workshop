Holly Hunt is a two-piece instru-metal behemoth from South Florida. Drummer Beatriz Monteavaro (Floor, Cavity) and guitarist Gavin Perry capture the meditative power of repetition; the ecstatic joy of tempered variation; infinitely undulating riffage; psychedelic drone paired with rock n' roll rhythm - in full splendor.

In the grand tradition of Monteavaro's previous musical endeavors, Holly Hunt champions heavy metal's potential to transcend genre and become a physical experience. Though stripped down to the most bare essentials, the duo's innate technical chops, strong dialogue, and incredibly deep relationship to their gear produces a sound and style far beyond rudimentary tags like "heavy," "hard," or "brutal."

Their first LP, "Year One" is out NOW as of Nov 2012. Visit http://hollyhunt.bandcamp.com/
