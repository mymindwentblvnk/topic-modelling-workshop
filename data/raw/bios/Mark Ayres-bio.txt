Mark Ayres is a television composer, best known for work on Doctor Who, principally using digital synthesisers & samplers to create music. His Doctor Who work was during Sylvester McCoy's era (as the Seventh Doctor), comprising The Greatest Show in the Galaxy, Ghost Light & The Curse of Fenric.

Ayres was hired after he sent producer John Nathan-Turner a demonstration video containing music he had written to accompany Remembrance of the Daleks. As such, he was also involved in the last days of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, cataloguing & archiving their recordings for future use. As part of the BBC's unofficial Doctor Who Restoration Team, Ayres has also done much of the audio restoration work for the later VHS Doctor Who releases, as well as many of the DVD releases & all of the "Missing Soundtrack" CD releases since 1999. Additionally, he edited the "Special Edition" of The Curse of Fenric, which restored much footage which was originally cut for time, along with some new special effects & a complete remix of the soundtrack. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mark+Ayres">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
