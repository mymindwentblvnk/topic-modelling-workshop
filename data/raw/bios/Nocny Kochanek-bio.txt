NOCNY KOCHANEK is one of the few Polish metal bands that creates music and, above all, the accompanying texts with a huge distance to the group itself and to the stereotype usually associated with heavy metal.
The band consists of musicians from Night Mistress. They owe their name to Bartosz Walaszek - the director of a popular cartoon "Kapitan bomba" (Captain Bomb), where you can hear the music of Night Mistress many times. In one episode the band performed under the name Nocny Kochanek, which is an ironic translation of its name Night Mistress. This event is considered to be the birth date for Nocny Kochanek.
In 2012 the band recorded a song for a feature film about the adventures of Kapitan Bomba "Zemsta Faraona" (Captain Bomb - Revenge of the Pharaoh). It is entitled Minerał Fiutta and is definitely is a composition with a grain of salt. Music of Nocny Kochanek should be described as traditional heavy metal, similar to style of Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Black Sabbath, or Saxon. The group feels great on stage and gives amazing performances. In 2014 they performed at the XX Woodstock Festival in Kostrzyn, Poland.
