Three bands have had the name Dimension Zero:

1) A Swedish Death Metal band 

2) A US based Electro/Gothic Rock band.

3) A US-based (Illinois) Metal-Punk crossover band that broke up in the late 1990s, featuring former members of Hiccup and a subsequent member of both As The Crow Flies and The Abacinators.

Dimension Zero are a Gothenburg, Sweden-based melodic death metal formed in 1996 as a sideproject of then In Flames guitarists Jesper Strömblad (playing bass here) and Glenn Ljungström. Former Marduk drummer/singer Joakim Göthberg would join later as vocalist, as well as Hans Nilsson (Diabolique, Crystal Age) behind the drumkit.

Second guitarist Fredrik Johansson left after the EP, Daniel Antonsson (Soilwork, Pathos, Dark Tranquillity) filled his place. After the second album, Glenn Ljungström left the band and Jesper switched to guitars. They hired Niclas Andersson (guitarist from Lord Belial) as bass player and headed to the studio for recording their 3rd album.

Musically, they have been described as strictly old-school Swedish death metal in the range of At The Gates, Unleashed, and Defleshed.. However, the melodic guitar-soloing of earlier In Flames is also present.

Also, Daniel Svensson (the drummer of In Flames, also the singer of Sacrilege) sung in their Sepultura cover Troops of Doom.
