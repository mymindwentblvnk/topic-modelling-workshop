A split-up band from Sykourio, Thessaly, Greece , playing a mixture of black/death/doom with a very distinct Greek sound. Active in the mid 90's they released two tapes: a promo in 1995 and the demo "Give Me Your Soul" in 1997, featuring Nikos Tsiverelos from Mortals' Dream on guest vocals. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/King+Of+Souls">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
