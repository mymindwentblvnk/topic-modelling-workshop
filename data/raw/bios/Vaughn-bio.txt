There are multiple artists releasing material under the name Vaughn.

1) Vaughn were a hard rock band formed by – and named after – vocalist Danny Vaughn, formerly of Tyketto and Waysted. 

The other initial band members were Michael Clayton (drums) and Jamie Scott (bass), both from Tyketto, and P.J. Zitarosa (guitar) and Kyle Cummings (keyboards), although the band subsequently went through a number of lineup changes. 

Vaughn released two studio albums ( Soldiers and Sailors on Riverside & Fearless ) and one live album ( Forever Live ) on Z Records, and supported FireHouse and Asia on tour.

In July 2006 it was decided that due to the constantly rotating lineup, amongst other reasons, all future work would be released under the name of Danny Vaughn.
