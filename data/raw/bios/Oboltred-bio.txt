OBOLTRED is a death metal band from Vilnius, Lithuania.

The band started around 2004 in Vilnius, Lithuania, when members from various musical
projects came together to rehearse popular thrash metal covers. Later,
own songs started to emerge. The band had to change few members,
because of incompatible musical tastes and visions. Despite this,
activity still was low and unproductive.

In 2008 band started to actively rehearse again, and a year after this
there had been another change in band members, when the founding
drummer was replaced. Later, new drummers joined, bringing faster and
brutal ideas with them, helping materialize OBOLTRED as a death metal
band.

In 2010 April, the band recorded "Garažo Revizorius" demo CD during
rehearsals. In summer-autumn of the same year, OBOLTRED had gigs along
with RENCOR, PARALYTIC, REGRESSIVE, KARMA JAWLESS and FARŠAS in
Vilnius, TALBOT and SURDR in Kaunas, RENCOR in Panevėžys and also
played in an open-air festival "Lentpjūvės Festivalis 2010".

In 2011 OBOLTRED rehearsed remotely with drummer and played at summer festival GiedFest 2011.

At the start of 2012 drummer Garloq from INQUISITOR joined OBOLTRED for recording sessions and live shows. Three new tracks were recorded for Split MC with band INHERITAGE. MC was released by Volcanic Slut Rex label.
