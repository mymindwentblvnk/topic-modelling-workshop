Priests are a post-punk band from Washington D.C. Formed in 2012, they are composed of Katie Alice Greer (vocals), Daniele Daniele (drums), Taylor Mulitz (bass), and G.L. Jaguar (guitar). Strong proponents of DIY ethic, Priests have autonomously released three EPs through their independently run label Sister Polygon Records, as well as tapes and singles from acts such as Downtown Boys, Snail Mail, Shady Hawkins, and other local D.C. bands. In an interview with the Diamondback, guitarist G.L. expressed their commitment to "do it yourself" approaches in creating exposure for corporately marginalized music, "It's important to try and make safe and supportive art spaces in communities that are very much community oriented." In 2017, Priests released their full length debut LP Nothing Feels Natural which found itself on several best albums of 2017 lists including Billboard, NPR, the Atlantic, and Pitchfork. On inauguration day, just days before the release of the album, the band played an event which they helped organize called NO: A Night of Anti-Fascist Sound Resistance in the Capital of the USA at Black Cat nightclub. Rolling Stone magazine described the band as "forging jagged incantations that challenge norms ranging from the driving forces of capitalism to punk's own chest-beating macho traditions." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Priests">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
