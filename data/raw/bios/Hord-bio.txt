The band posted via their facebook account:
"With a heavy heart, we're deeply sorry to announce the end of HORD. It is no longer possible for us to conciliate our private lives with the requirements of professional music. We want to thank all the persons who supported us at every level during this human and musical adventure of twelve years, especially our families, our friends, our label Send the Wood Music, our partners/sponsors and our public." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hord">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
