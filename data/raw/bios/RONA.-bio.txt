RONA. is the electronic project of Kaytetye producer and DJ Rona Glynn-McDonald. Coming to you from Mparntwe in the Central Desert, RONA. shapes sounds for the ongoing journey of finding connection between many worlds. RONA. combines the soundscapes of Country and place with synths and melodies that pack emotional punch. Moving between Naarm and the desert, RONA. explores connections between the industrial dance floors of Naarm to the soundscapes and rhythms of her home. Drawing from these distinct spaces, her infectious sound can stir any dance floor through thoughtful and moving electronica. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/RONA.">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
