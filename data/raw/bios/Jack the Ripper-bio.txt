1.Jack The Ripper forms part of these formations which skilfully knew to transcend their poisonous influences come straight of Nick Cave through melodies elegant, melancholic persons and tinted of a dark and slightly obsolete romanticism, that French would not have known to evoke with as much intensity. 
It is into 1995 that eight Parisian musicians decide to found the group Jack The Ripper. This Christian name is heavy direction, since it is also the name of the most famous British serial killer, which prevailed in the district of Whitechapel in London of the end of XIXe century. Thus, the sound world of Jack The Ripper is far from being alleviating and merry, flirtant on the contrary with tormented environments which attract us unrelentingly. Besides one cannot prevent oneself from thinking of Doors, in Tindersticks like with the first two albums of Sixteen Horsepower, when one puts Jack The Ripper on the turntable.

---->I was going to re-write this, but I think it uses such a unique brand of English it deserves to be preserved. However I will do a translation: 

Jack the Ripper are an 8 piece Indie rock band from Paris. Strong influences of Nick Cave, The Doors and Tindersticks produce a uniquely unsettling and haunting array of vocals and melodies that do justice to a name that brings dark, menacing , thoughts of 19th centuary London and sets the scene for the whole band.
