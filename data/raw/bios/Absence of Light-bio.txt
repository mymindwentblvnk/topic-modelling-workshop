There are two known bands with the name Absence of Light;

1) Absence of Light are a three piece from Portland, OR. We play stoned psychedelic-soaked metal, at times down-tempo sludge and doom-influenced and at times up-tempo crust and heavy metal influenced... A demo has been recorded and we are trying to release a split 12" LP. We regularly play our hometown of Portland and make adventures up and down the West Coast a priority. In the future, we hope to tour on a larger scale and release records we will be proud of.

 (Former and current members of Nux Vomica, Lasers for Eyes, Wretched Of The Earth, Spirospero, Ochlocracy, Wake Up On Fire, 57 Octaves Below, Deadpan Pariah, Deterrorformed, Bodhisattva, Nanda Devi, Bookends, typwrytrs...)

2) A Blackened Death Metal band from Nairobi, Kenya. Their debut EP "Vyom Chakra" was released on 11.11.11.
Their members are of Indian descent, but have all been raised in Kenya.
