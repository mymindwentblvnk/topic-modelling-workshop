Jan Dukes De Grey was a short-lived British progressive-folk band. Formed in 1969, they were one of the very last prog-rock bands to be signed to Decca's prog label. They originally started out as just a duo (Derek Noy and Michael Bairstow) and were rivals to glam-rock band T. Rex.

Their first album, "Sorcerers" was a typical acid folk album, not particularly adventurous but showcased Noy's and Bairstow's multi-instrumental talents. The album made little impact and is only available through bootleg. Their greatest work was to come - with the addition of drummer Denis Conlan they recorded their masterpiece "Mice And Rats In The Loft" in 1971. Consisting of three lengthy, psych-drenched tracks, it was a lot more free-form than their earlier work and had much more progressive leaning, with use of a large assortment of instruments, even utilizing an orchestra. Sadly the album made little impact, and Jan Dukes De Grey disbanded after its release. After this initial dis-banding, Noy, Dellar, and McElroy joined with musician Nick Griffiths to perform briefly as punk band Rip Snorter through 1976 and the start of 1977.

Then a reincarnated band was put together consisting primarily of Noy, along with Dellar, McElroy, and newly added keyboardist Peter Lemer providing backup. A third album, Strange Terrain, was recorded but not released and the band dissolved permanently shortly afterward. The third, and final, album was finally released in 2010 under the Cherrytree label. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jan+Dukes+De+Grey">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
