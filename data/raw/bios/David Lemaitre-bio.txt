A voice that is reminiscent of José González and Beirut. An introspection you might know of Elliot Smith and Nick Drake, and the influence of psychedelic bands from the seventies. You might think David Lemaitre has heard it all in his youth. Guess again. Lemaitre was born in the thin air of La Paz, Bolivia. His mother raised him on the songs of the South American highlands. Studying in Germany and traveling through Europe got Lemaitre in contact with all different kinds of music. What he made himself was a mixture of folk and electronics. For six months he worked on EP Valediction, and now he is finishing his first complete album in Berlin. In a live setting, Lemaitre creates orchestral landscapes with his voice, guitar and minimal loop devices. On stage he is joined by Philipp the Orchestra, together they love layering sounds and colors, and positioning big orchestral passages within tiny intimate acoustic songs. Lemaitre played the Melt! Festival and supported Get Well Soon on their European tour. He is ready to match in his career the great heights of his childhood. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/David+Lemaitre">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
