Frostgrave is Old School Satanic Black Metal previously named Blizzard. Lyrics and music have been written during 1994-1995, followed by recordings in 1996. Frostgrave is the first release of the Absolute Hell, which is totally carrying that smell of 90's behind, not loosing a bit of that great atmosphere! Larenuf played all strings and vocals, Alcogolik played drums (members of Tangorodrim). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Frostgrave">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
