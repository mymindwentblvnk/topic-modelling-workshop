The Puerto Rican metal scene around the first half of he 90’s saw a burst of creative bands releasing demo, and even full-length albums; amongst them were the melodic and progressive sounds of a band called Elishia.
Although the band had a short life they performed around the island and released the demo The Vague Scent of Pallid Mallows in '97; which received good response locally and abroad.
It is in this band that the duo of Aclinic Line had its first collaboration; back then in rhythm-section capacity. After the demise of Alishia, Alejandro Canchani (drums) & ex-fanzine editor Fernando Quiñones (bass) would try out different projects without satisfactory results.

It would be years until Alishia, now concentrating on vocals, and Fernando could work together in their shared ideas.
The opportunity for that arrived in the 2000’s with the addition of 6 strings to Alishia’s repertoire. First working as Random Effect, the duo rehearsed without any specific goal in mind but a need to create.
Now know as Aclinic this veteran musicians offer the demo Bubbly for your consideration. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Aclinic+Line">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
