The band was formed by Rafallus and Sagitarius in Autumn 1996. Both played earlier in a death-grind band Necrolatry (Rafallus since 1992, Sagitarius since 1994) and recorded a demo Fear Landscape. Even before that, they participated in a project called Thorns. 
First line-up of Shemhamforash: 
* Rafallus (Rafael Polański) - guitar, 
* Sagitarius Ariel (Krzysztof Zagórowicz) - bass, 
* Gatabial Scorpio (Adam Sierżęga) - drums, 
* Mat (Maciej…?) - keyboards, 
* Silent P.N (Przemek Nowakowski) - guitar. 
In May 1997 Shemhamforash records their first full-lenght material entitled „Luciferi Omnis Ysighda” in Selani Studio, Olsztyn. Additionally, this release has been enriched with Sagitarius’ symphonic suite „Dolor Ante Lucem” by which the name of the album is known as „Luciferi Omnis Ysighda with Dolor Ante Lucem Dark Orchestra”. Later on, the album was released on a cassette by Evil Crow label at the end of 1997. By now, this album is a rarity for collectors. In 1998 the band splits. Sagitarius joines a death metal band Lost Soul. 
In 2000 Rafallus decides to resurrect Shemhamforash and invites WarSin (Sebastian Wosinek, currently Phosphoros). After a year Lousie Seiffer - bass (Jakub Mikłas, currently Demogorgon and Baphomet’s Throne) and Mannequin - vocals (Piotr Poleszczuk) join in. 
In May 2002 the band records „Spintriam Satyriasis - phallus prestige”, which gets great recognition in Poland as well as abroad. Due to problems with releasing of the album, quarrels among the band-members resulted in suspension of Shemhamforash. Yet in 2007 Rafallus invites famed musicians and „Metamorphemous” is being recorded. Band line-up for this material is: 
* Rafallus - guitar, 
* Louise Seiffer - bass, 
* Gatabial S. - drums, 
* Necrosodom - vocals (currently Anima Damnata).
