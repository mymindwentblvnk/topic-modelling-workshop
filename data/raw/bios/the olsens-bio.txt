Although Mary Kate and Ashley met on the school paper of their university in 2008, it wouldn't be until about 2010 when they finally decided to take the running joke of their names and turn it into a band. The Olsens started with small on-campus open mic events which always featured small instruments, such as the ukulele and violin, and between-song banter. While they have yet to compile songs of their own writing, the two girls greatly enjoy reinterpreting songs ranging from those of The Misfits to Florence + the Machine.The Olsens are based outside of Philadelphia, PA.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Olsens">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
