Okera is a melodic death doom metal band from Melbourne, Australia. They were founded by Jayme in the later months of 2006, purely as a studio side-project. As time went on, the project became more serious, and in mid 2008, the line-up as it is today was completed. They've been playing gigs around Melbourne since mid 2009, and have shared the stage with other local talents Be'lakor, Arbrynth, Rainshadow, Wood of Suicides, Obsidieth, AMDBL, Orpheus, Envenomed as well as supporting Singapore act Meltgsnow. Their music is melodic death / doom metal rooted in progressive rock, with melancholic overtones; and dark, subtle nuances. They are currently rehearsing frequently, playing gigs when they suit; while writing and preparing for their debut album, to be released sometime in 2011.
