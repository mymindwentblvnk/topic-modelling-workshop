In september 2007 Váli, Skirmir and Vargur came together for playing music. Out of there jam sessions the idea was born to start a project together: Rabenwolf was born. First known under a different name, they found other musicians who joined them. Quickly they came to the result which kind of music they wanted to play: A connection of the different styles Metal and Folk.

Heavy riffs and harsh, extreme vocals contra acoustic instruments, walls of sound and backing vocals – either alternating or linked together with the main vocals – the songs are meant to reach the ear of the listeners powerful and drifting and reflect deep emotions like anger, happiness, melancholy or just fun. The lyrics tell stories of old myths and gods in a new way, but also own stories and experiences can be found. Respect of nature and humans is the moving power behind the music.

Since september 2008 the band consists of eight members and is working continuously on new songs to enlarge their repertoire. Especially in 2009 the six boys and two girls were able to collect live experience on local concerts and festivals all over Germany, for example Waldbrand Open Air and Metal Bash. At the end of the year a gig in Salisbury (UK) followed. For 2010 several concerts in and out of Germany are announced and there are plans to release an album Rabenwolf are working on.
