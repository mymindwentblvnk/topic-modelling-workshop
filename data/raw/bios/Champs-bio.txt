There are several artists named 'Champs' ;

1)  Champs are Michael and David Champion, two brothers from the Isle of Wight's Victorian seaside retreat of Ventnor. 

Their debut album, Down Like Gold, was recorded at Studio Humbug, an old water tower inside the walls of Osborne House, Queen Victoria's retreat on the north of island. Designed by Prince Albert in 1845, the building has a large top floor that now houses a studio and above it all sits a glorious metal roof that acts as a natural echo chamber - a utility this band really made the most of.
