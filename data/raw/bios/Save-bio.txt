1. Save is a modern metal band with female growling vocals hailing from Moscow, Russia. The band released its first LP Зачем Тебе Жить (Zachem tebe jit' / What do you live for?) in 2004. It was a record mainly in the nu-metal genre. Its second LP - Мегаполис / Megapolis was released in 2007. This record has more death metal and modern metal elements. Very soon the band is due to release a completely new record named Под Руку С Мечтой (Pod Ruku S Mechtoy / Hand In Hand With A Dream) that sees the band further explore the territory of death metal, modern metal and math metal and adding some dual guitar leads and other elements previously not so apparent in the band's music.
