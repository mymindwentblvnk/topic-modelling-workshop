Saturn's Husk is a Latvian blackened sludge/shoegaze (early doom metal) band from Rīga, Latvia.

The members came together in the mid-autumn of 2014 with a simple goal in their minds - to worship slow and heavy riffs. Instead of going the traditional way (releasing a demo, playing live shows etc.), they agreed upon doing something a bit different. The band decided to create a complete DIY concept album rather than just a compendium of demo songs.

Current members:

Jurijs Kaštanovs - guitars;
Regnārs Breikšs - bass, vocals;
Armands Baranovskis - drums, synthesizers.

Former members:

Vidvuds Sils - guitar.
