At the core of Indie Dance and Deep House music, Swiss based Nora En Pure is on a quest to fulfil her need to arouse feelings of bliss and inject unconventional and serene sensations to be carried out into the world. The vivid South African has already proven to be quite productive, what resulted in deep and funky works of audible engineering for the label Enormous Tunes and Tokenish since 2009. Besides her passion for Africa, only music has been able to steal her feelings to that extent leading her to dedicate more and more mind and soul to it. The melodic but mesmerising club music has been fashioning a big and an undoubtedly dedicated fanbase.

Her Remix for Daniel Portmanâ€™s KHAWERI in 2010 got huge reactions from all global players, became the preferential mix of the single and launched her career as aproducer.In 2011 her track YOU MAKE ME FLOAT hit Top50 of Beatport charts, made the cut onto legendary Buddha Bar Compilation and got over 500k views on youtube. In fall 2012 she released AURELIA, which became a requested club hit and made it on various compilations. Her crossover chart hit COME WITH ME first saw lights in February 2013 and made its way up on top of Beatport charts, and remained in Top100 for over 7 months. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nora+En+Pure">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
