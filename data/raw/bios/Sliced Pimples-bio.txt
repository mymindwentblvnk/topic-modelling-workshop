Danish thrash metal band, formed in 1987. The band split some time after 1989, where their last album was released.

Last known line-up (on their last album):

Claus Andersen - Vocals
Tim Lynge - Guitar
Kim Knudsen - Guitar
Johnny Paw Andersen - Bass
Andreas Ludvigsen - Drums

The band was fairly big in the metal metal underground and skater community in the late 80s and early 90s, due to their fun lyrics and metal versions of a danish children's song called 'Jeg g√•r og hedder Frede' and the world-known 'New York, New York'.

The band's two albums were only released on vinyl, and are still available today in one store (Rock Uglen) in Copenhagen, Denmark.
