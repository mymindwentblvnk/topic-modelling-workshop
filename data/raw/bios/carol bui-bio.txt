Jeff Buckley was once pitched to a Columbia Records A&R man as a "Heritage Artist" in the same vein as Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen. It is in their shadow that Carol Bui emerges as perhaps the most singular and distinct voice of the Washington, DC music scene. Her self-released debut, This is How I Recover, fused lyrical guitar lines with poetic phrasing and revels in its ability to dish finely crafted narratives within a framework of heavy friction post-punk rock.

This is music for people who listen to records.

Carol's second full-length, Everyone Wore White, is the product of a collaboration between Carol and Aloha's TJ Lipple, who is also prominently featured on drums. Smarter and more raucous than anything you've heard in recent years, the record is colored with scratchy strings, agitated guitars, and stories of displaced spirituality, psychosis, and a bicultural coming-of-age. Yet melody is never sacrificed; a tight union of beauty and terror.

Everyone Wore White also features guest appearances by Chad Clark (Beauty Pill, Dischord Records) and Daniel Hart (The Physics of Meaning, ex-Polyphonic Spree). The release is set for October 2, 2007 via 54ยบ 40' or Fight! Records (The Life and Times, 31 Knots, Ticonderoga).

Carol is touring with her band nationally throughout the summer and fall to support this release.
