SYN:DROM was formed 2002 in Sundsvall, Sweden and the line-up has been the same since then.

The first demo called "Dead Silent Screaming" got a lot of great reviews and response worldwide! The sound at the time was pretty typical swedish death/trash with some melodic inputs.

If you got any interest in SYND:DROM's sources of inspiration nowadays it would be bands like: Nile, Decapitated, Vader, Morbid Angel, and Strapping Young Lad, just to mention a few. 

In 2004 SYN:DROM recorded 12 songs, 2 songs from that recording are available at their MySpace ("Black Crown" and "Human Harvest"). This recording was never really mixed to be released and we are gonig to re-record a couple of songs along with some new shit. 

SYN:DROM has never been about massproducing songs, they rather spend a lot of time writing and working on one song to make sure it gets perfect, instead of just spitting out new songs all the time. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/SYN:DROM">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
