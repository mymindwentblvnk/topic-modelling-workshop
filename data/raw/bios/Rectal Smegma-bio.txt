Brutal death metal/goregrind from Holland

Rectal Smegma started late 2003 under the name Carnal Rancidity. After a month or 2 we deceided to continue under the name Rectal Smegma.
After a few line-up changes and some weeks we remained as: Yannic: vocals Frans: guitar, Robin: bass and Walter: drums.
After a load of gigs and the recording of our debute album Licking a Leper Robin left the band due to amputated limbs.
After about 2 years of making crazy fucking noise on stages all over Holland our car ran over a poor homeless indian fellow named Madhur who was looking for a band to play guitar in.
Our hearts filled with sorrow and pity we couldn't let him be damned so we took him in our band, eventually he would become our bass player.

Still we travel around the country and abroad to play gigs everywhere we can.
