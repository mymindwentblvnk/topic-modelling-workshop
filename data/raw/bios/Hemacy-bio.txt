The band was founded towards the end of 2007 by two members: [ Abed Halawi ] , [ Ahmad El-Masri ] . Soon after, [ Rana Ockaili ] (ex-female vocal) [ Jamal Zaarour ] joined in. What started out as a Gothic project turned into a Symphonic / Dark Metal project. In January 2008, and after a few failed attempts at finding the right members, [ Marielle Ghanem ] (keyboardist), [ Jad Asmar ] and [ Ralph Habchy ] joined to complete the band formation. 

The project started playing some cover songs from similar styles to get the band together, it has recently moved on to focus mainly on originals. After wards, [ Marielle Ghanem ] left the band in April 2008, due to some social / personal reasons; [ Sara maftoum ] Replaced her on October 6 /2008. [ Rana ockaili ] has been dismembered on August 10 due to her lack of commitment recently towards the band.

The chosen name for the band was "Theurgy", the band members came out with a decision to change the name due to a refreshing start based on the release of the first demo single "Infernal stigmata" along with the voice of [ Tamara Broumana ].

Hemacy had its first appearance as "Theurgy" at NOVA pub in the "AUB BATTLE OF THE BANDS" event; were eventually announced Winners of the battle.
