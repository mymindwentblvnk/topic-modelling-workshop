Chris Knox (born 2 September 1952 in Invercargill) is a New Zealand musician and cartoonist.

Starting his vocal career with NZ punk band The Enemy in 1977, Knox has involved in the NZ music scene ever since. Frontman for the short-lived but energetic Toy Love and one half of the perpetually magical duo that is Tall Dwarfs - as well as recording and performing his own solo works.  Knox assembled Chris Knox & The Nothing in the mid-2000s and recorded two albums.  

On Thursday 11 June 2009, Knox was admitted to Auckland hospital suffering from a stroke. This initially left him with limited speech and mobility. Friends and family of Knox initiated a blog that kept people updated. An album of various musicians from around the world performing Knox's songs was produced entitled "Stroke: Songs for Chris Knox" with all proceeds going to Knox. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Chris+Knox">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
