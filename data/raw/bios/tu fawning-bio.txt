Tu Fawning was an American four-piece band founded by Corrina Repp and Joe Haege, augmented, soon after its inception, by members Liza Rietz and Toussaint Perrault. The band split in 2012. 

Haege (member of Menomena and founder of 31knots) was a longtime fan of Repp's songwriting. This  brought them to work together on Repp's 2006 solo album "The Absent and the Distant", which was Repp's first "outside" release for Mark Kozelek's (Red House Painters)  artist-owned Caldo Verde records. 

Once the decision had been made to start  a project together, Repp and Haege quickly realized the strongest foundation they could call upon would be their mutual love for timeless melodies that  are as catchy as they are otherworldly, replete with tribal beats that have passed through the hands and hearts of anyone in love with primal rhythm and cadence. Once Rietz (former member of Swords) and Perrault had joined the four-piece, they were ready. 
 
They released the albums "Hearts On Hold" (2010) and "A Monument" (2012), after which the band split.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tu+Fawning">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
