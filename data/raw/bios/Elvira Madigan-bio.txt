Elvira Madigan is the one-man project of Marcus H Madigan. He describes the band as 'Black/Speed/Progressive Metal'. Recording, producing and mastering the entire process alone, Marcus has over the period of eight years, released a total of four full albums. The most recent album 'Regent Sie', was followed by an announcement that the project would be put on hiatus.

The 2005 album 'Angelis Daemonae' is different to Madigan's other work, in that it consists entirely of cover songs, done in the Elvira Madigan style. The album includes covers of Chris De Burgh, Tori Amos and Nobuo Uematsu. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Elvira+Madigan">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
