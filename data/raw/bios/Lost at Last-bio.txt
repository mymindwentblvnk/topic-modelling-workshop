There are two artists with this name: 1) a Norwegian metal band, and 2) a world fusion electronica band.

1) Lost at Last is a heavy metal band from Bergen, Norway. The band released their first EP in 1994 and the initial lineup contained, in addition to Tony King and Mr Heinemeyer, Rock Daemon and Horgh. In 1995, Horgh left the band and later joined Immortal.

Lost at Last struggled to have a big break-through and, despite of two album releases and a UK tour, their first chance to play an important gig came at the Inferno Festival in 2003. This show really did turn things for the band and their reputation has grown ever since.

Lost at Last claims to be the "Best Heavy Metal Band in The World".

Lineup

2) Lost at Last is also a tribal trance and world fusion band from the Hawaiian island Maui. The band was formed in 1996 and the members moved to San Fransisco in 1997 to merge with the region's burgeoning trance scene.

In the summer of 2004, Jaya Lakshmi and Deva Priyo began working with other electronica artists and experimenting with different formulas to deepen and refine their sound. They also changed the bandname to One at Last.
