Nurse & Soldier's Marginalia is gentle, bewildered psych-pop from the partnership of Robertson Thacher (aka Bobby Matador of Oneida) and longtime collaborator Erica Fletcher. The two have been making music together since their teenage years, a long history reflected in the intimate nature of the music. Far more vulnerable and raw than Oneida, Nurse & Soldier sing about longing, betrayal and reconciliation; the sound of Marginalia is a confused murmur, as opposed to Oneida's punishing roar.

The two multi-instrumentalists sing and play organs, guitars, synths, woodwinds, drums, and more ?ey are also joined by friends, including regular collaborator Jake Bailey (guitar, organ, drums) and Kid Millions of Oneida (drums). Marginalia is their second full-length record, following 2001's self-released Ancient History. All songs were recorded in Brooklyn, New York, during the current century.
