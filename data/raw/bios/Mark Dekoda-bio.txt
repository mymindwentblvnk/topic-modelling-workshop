Marko Meingast, better known as Mark Dekoda was born 1987 in Munich, Germany. He started to produce music late 2006 and switched up from underground trance progressive music to minimal-techno music in 2009. Mark is humble about his position as an artist in the crazy. He promotes taking time to make quality tracks as opposed to pushing out remix after remix like a lot of Mainstream Electric artists. His previous releases are speaking for themselves, hitting the Beatport minimal charts in a couple of time. Tracks like "Snow White" "Ghost" "Crackin" and "Cold Cuz" where included in the top 5 as well. His tracks are getting more and more dynamic from every release until now. It seems to be working well for him, same as in his live performances all around the world. So stay tuned and watch out. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mark+Dekoda">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
