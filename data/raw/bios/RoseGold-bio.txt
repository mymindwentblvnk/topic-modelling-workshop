rosegold is a British-Danish duo consisting of the siblings Joshua (17) and Raiden (21) Duncan. 
They make dark-as-the-night, oozingly cool and danceable hip-hop/R&B with an international sound. The music is created on a very melodic foundation, which you rarely hear in this type of music. rosegold’s sound is mostly known for their mixture between British grime and R&B/hip-hop from the US.

The brothers grew up in a very strict Christian household in South London, where secular music was not allowed. This gave them a different understanding of what music was, which can easily be tracked throughout their music.

They started their career in 2017 when they released the Caribbean-flavoured “Mrs. 123”. Later, more singles and a debut album, Adventures in Odyssey, followed. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/RoseGold">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
