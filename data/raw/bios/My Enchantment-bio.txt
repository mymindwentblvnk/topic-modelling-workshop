My Enchantment is a band from Barreiro, Portugal, which started in 1999, playing a extreme and agressive black metal at the time, under the name of Near Death Experience (N.D.E.).

The band line up changed and a new guitar player, a new bass player and a new drummer added to the black metal influences of Doom and Gothic, resulting in a more confident and melodic sound.

On the road, the band played in various concerts from the center to the south of Portugal, being well accepted by the audiences and the media, like radios and newspapers. The band also achieved a 2nd place in a contest that resulted in a concert at the Barreiro festive commemorations and a 1st place at a band contest in Setubal. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/My+Enchantment">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
