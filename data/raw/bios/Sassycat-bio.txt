A frontrunner in the Detroit hard rock scene, SASSYCAT was established in early 1989. The founding members Craig Black, Phillip "St. Joseph" Gajewski, Joey Neely, and Randy "Scott" Singleton rocked hard and added guitarist Scott Nykes in 1990. SASSYCAT was a five fingered fist ready to punch through the walls of conventional hard rock. The band had built up a solid reputation for it's groove-orientated smash-it-up style and Craig Black's accessible, dynamic voice. Rocking hard in all the venues the city had to offer. SASSYCAT shared the stage with some well known bands throughout the years. Bands like Bang Tango, The Front, Dangerous Toys, Little Caesar, Shotgun Messiah, Babylon A.D., Saigon Kick, My Sister's Machine, Seduce, Gene Loves Jezebel, and Soundgarden. Known for partying just as hard as they played. It was a good time for all who came to enjoy and participate. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/SASSYCAT">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
