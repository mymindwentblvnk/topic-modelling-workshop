The Columbia Symphony Orchestra was an orchestra formed by Columbia Records. It provided a vehicle for some of Columbia's better known recording artists to record using only company resources. Perhaps the most important recordings the orchestra made were with conductor Bruno Walter, who recorded highly regarded interpretations of Beethoven's, Brahms', and Mozart's symphonies.

The term Columbia Symphony Orchestra was also used when, for contractual reasons, another orchestra could not appear under its own name.
