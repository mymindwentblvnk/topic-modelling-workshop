When Woods Make Graves is a one man Black Metal project from Liverpool, England. Drawing influences from Burzum, Darkspace/Paysage D'Hiver, Weakling, Wolves In the Throne Room, Fen and more.

Started in 2009 as nothing more than a hobby - a few tracks where handed out among friends and online and the feedback was positive. It wasn't until leaving a job in late 2010 that WWMG decided to expand upon the project further - through unexpected financial gains WWMG were able to fund their own production in September 2011 and so began recording.

At present, (August 2012), the band has not performed live and currently have no intentions of doing so. They have released two digital demos in 2012 and plan on a third in October of the same year. The reception of this release will dictate further releases. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/When+Woods+Make+Graves">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
