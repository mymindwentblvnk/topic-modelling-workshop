Various artists named Hocus Pocus.

1. - Hocus Pocus is a Hip Hop band from Nantes, France. Formed in 1995, their music is a mix of all hip-hop true elements with live instrumentation influenced by jazz, soul & funk music. 
This band gives positive vibrations, stepping outside the French rap box. The alchemy between the intruments and the main rapper/DJ/band leader 20Syl, results in a appreciable coherence.
The lineup includes muscians Matthieu Lelièvre (on fender rhodes) Hevré Gogard (on bass), and Antoine Saint-Jean (on drums) with DJ Greem and 20Syl (MC), both members of C2C, the DJ crew, 2003-to-2006 DMC World DJ Team Championships winner.
Often compared with The Roots, Their live performance are often showy, mostly when the standard live instruments communicate with the turntables.
