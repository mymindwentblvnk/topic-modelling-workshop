Nox Hibernus is a one-man extreme metal band from Norway. Well... not so much "from" Norway as "lied about it because that's so KVLT". The project emerged in 2007 from mastermind George Stobbart, who took his name from some gay computer game character, who Stobbart reveres as “a fine example of the master race”. Stobbart’s lyrics cover subject matter such as God and Jesus “being gay”, PIXAR being cool, and - as George himself has admitted - is occasionally just gibberish, screaming and vomiting. Over the years, Nox Hibernus has encompassed black metal gangsta rap, soundbytes from Christian kids' shows, "extremely lo-fi black metal recorded at 1kbps", and of course, that which started it all: death/black metal versions of popular Christmas songs. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nox+Hibernus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
