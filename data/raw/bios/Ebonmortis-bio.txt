The band formed in 2004 with Dave Gormely and Josh Dwiel on guitars, Brian Scott on Drums and Cuntry on Vocals. They went on to play shows and even record the "Born Into Darkness" 6 track EP without a bassist. After a year and a half as a 4-piece with no bassist, Eric Annable joined the band.

EBONMORTIS was complete... But shortly after Eric's arrival, Dave had to leave the band. It wasn't long until Face, a long time friend of the band, joined as Dave's replacement.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ebonmortis">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
