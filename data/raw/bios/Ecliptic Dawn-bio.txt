Ecliptic Dawn is the first Gothic Metal act from Syria, the band was found by Sam  "Poet Of Eclipse" in early 2010 after composing one song at that time. Afterwords, other 2 songs and an intro were fully composed in summer, and by the end of summer everything was recorded and ready for production by Niall Doran, the production and mastering process for the EP which was called "Eternal Night Of Eclipse" was done in the end of 2010. Due to lack of musicians in Syria,Sam had to contact session musicians via internet.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ecliptic+Dawn">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
