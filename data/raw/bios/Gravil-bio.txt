GraVil are a 5 piece metal band based in London, UK. Their line-up includes lead guitarist Ryszard Gabrielczyk, rhythm section of Tony Dando (Guitars), James Chapman (Drums) and Nathan "Sparx" Lamb (Bass), rounded off by vocalist Gra.

The bands sound has been descibed by Rocksound Magazine as "Mixing up all things Chimaira and Dark Tranquility" and Kerrang! magazine review as "Brutalising Tech Metal Wizardry". Tracks such as Helmsman, Something Worth Chasing and March of the Titans (co written alongside Cradle Of Filth axeman James McIlroy) have recieved numerous media coverage incluiding Ian Camfields XFM rockshow, Bruce Dickinsons BBC6 Rockshow and Scuzz TV. The EP "Age Of Corruption" also enjoyed a stint on HMV's front page as a featured rock/metal artist.

With the debut album in the final stages and the live show taking off, 2011 is panned out to be a good year for GraVil, and saw them support metal underground giant Saturnian, The Furious Horde, MAn of Kin and Beholder. Only a month into 2012 they played main support for "The Defiled" in Bournemouth, 2012 could be the year boredom ceases and the metal force that is GraVil will be unleashed
