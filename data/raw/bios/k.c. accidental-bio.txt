K.C. Accidental was a Canadian indie rock band which formed the original basis for Broken Social Scene.

The core of the band consisted of Kevin Drew (Broken Social Scene) and Charles Spearin (Do Make Say Think), and started out as a two person recording outfit. The "K.C." in the band's name was taken from the initials of their first names. They released two albums of mostly instrumental music. The project's second album, Anthems for the Could've Bin Pills, also included contributions from Jason Collett, Evan Cranley, Emily Haines, Jason McKenzie, Jessica Moss, James Payment, Bill Priddle, James Shaw and Justin Small.

Many of the musicians involved in the album went on to work with Broken Social Scene, who released their debut album, Feel Good Lost in 2001. Spearin and Drew released a second album afterwards, with the track listing for both albums structured to seem as if Anthems and Captured Anthems were one full album. The Anthems track listing was shown as having 6 blank tracks before the 6 music tracks, whereas the Captured Anthems was presented in the opposite fashion (1-6 music tracks, 7-12 blank).

Broken Social Scene also included a song with the title "KC Accidental" on its Juno Award-winning album You Forgot It in People. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/K.C.+Accidental">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
