Grindcore band with death-metal and hardcore influences from Montreal, Quebec (Canada). They formed in 2007 consisting of two members from Obscene Crisis, with both bands playing grindcore in the same old vein. At date they have recorded a demo and two albums and their sound nowadays is very technical, well produced and close to Metal genre, despite their lyrical themes are about social issues, third world, politics, etc.
