south Germany s Death Metal
band BOWTOME
The songs for ther first album Killer have been written between
1998 and 2004. From 2004 to 2006 the
band took a break and started with the
recording of Killer in winter 2006 at
Powerbass Studios with producer Connie
Andreszka [CABAL, CRYSTAL BALL
CIRCLE OF PAIN ]
The first chapter of 6 songs is about the
serial killer Ted Bundy [written between
2003 and 2004]. The second chapter
contains two songs, &quot;Sick, Gun Dead&quot; and
&quot;Soldier s Revenge&quot;, which were only
released as rough-mix mp3s on the
website in the year 2002. The third and
last chapter of Killer is dedicated to the
beginning of BOWTOME. These three
tracks were only released on the livedemo
CD Cum On Me, 1999 in a rough
live mix. Now you can hear it in a very
brutal and pounding sound
Be prepared for more than 45 minutes of
straight fuckin old school Death Metal in
the style of the early 90 s! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bowtome">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
