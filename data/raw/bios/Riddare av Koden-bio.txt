In October 2006 two brothers Nathan and Daniel Wilson from the small town of Secunda approached Shailin Kallin to start a band, within weeks the three knew they were onto something great and later asked Kevin Webber (Bloodstick) to join them as bass guitarist. Together these four friends formed the mighty Elegy.

From their first gig in November 2006, performing at Brendan Village, Secunda they moved rapidly into the entertainment world by establishing their fan base and ended the year on the rise.  2007 saw Elegy played a multitude of gigs including large festivals such as Bellfest, The Summoning, Seasons Wither 1, as well as being part of the Battle for Blind Guardian and Chromiums album launch tour.  Their success continued as Elegy took part in Seasons wither 2 and 3, Grimfest, Secunda Rock fest, Metal rights day, Motherfudd 2008 and 2009.

Their self titled EP was recorded at Gunston Records in Johannesburg and comprises of 3 tracks, including fan favorite “Ad Nauseum”. After the great success that was achieved with the EP they decided to hit the studio again later that year to record their first full length album, released in February 2009 “A voice will call” has airplay on various campus and online radio stations. Working together with Duncan Bell from Turning Tricks Entertainment (A&R – www.turningtricksentertainment.co.za) , the album will be distributed through Electromode (www.electromodemusic.co.za) and is available in music stores nationwide.

In November 2009 Elegy were forced into a name change due to copyright issues with the name. The new name “Riddare av Koden” was decided on and released to the fans on 16th November. Our legacy continues under the new name as we are the knights of the heavy metal code.
