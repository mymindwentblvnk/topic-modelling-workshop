Dirty talking band start on spring 2000. Main initiator was Zbyněk Šáleený (guitar) who have wanted to play old school punk mixed with grunge. But others members - Miloš Polášek (guitar) and Vlasta Buček (vocal) - had different idea. Then comes up something untypical. The coming of Petr Sarközy shows it won't be grunge. After short time band start concerting. Before first demo record two band has some changes around guitar position. First Demo was released on spring 2002 with name Fecal Beauty. 

Early on the summer 2002 coming Jura Štěpán (bass). His creativity gives new direction for Dirty Talking. Bad luck is endless and soon Zbyněk and Kozel (Profesor Lefebvre in present) left band. Behind drumms sits Alan Vičánek. Everything starts from beginning - shows, new material for record. On spring 2004 band make second record named Trhák.

On autumn join to group Roman Kalvoda (guitar). Spring 2007 - band is in studio again and make album Nic Nám není Svaté.
