Born in Poona (India). Raised up in Lower Saxony (Germany).

Daso Franke, born 19/02/1981, was a Cologne-based electronic musician, who started his career performing with Bum Khun Cha Youth, subsequently releasing the famous Gespenster Remix for Jens Friebe. After his solo debut "Daybreak" (2005), he released "Go Upstairs" (Feb 2006), "Adventure" (Aug 2006) and the highly regarded "Meine Idee" EP (2007), featuring renowned tracks "Meine" and "Idee".

Franke went on to have a prolific and successful career, publishing several more EPs, such as "Open Cage" (2011) and "All My People" (2012). Following this, amongst other releases, most notably "Awake At Night" (2013), two 2015 releases "I Seek", "Bold & Bold/Ashvem Beach" and "No Lead" (2016), all accumulated to complete his pre-humous discography, shortly before a battle with cancer resulted in his passing on 2 April 2018.

The spirit, talent and gift for music of Franke lives on through his music, with album "Daso" being his final release, post-humously published on 1 April 2019, a year after his passing.
