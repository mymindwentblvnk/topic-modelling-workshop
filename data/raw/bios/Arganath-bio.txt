Arganath was found in 2002. There was a young man called Hereticius who met Ardyth who
wanted to make some black metal music. So they started some stupid shit under the name "Dark Mantra". In summer 2002 it was changed to "Arganath". After that Ardyth left. So Hereticius started to make music by himself. But it sounded so shitty that he stopped. At fall 2003 he asked from Valek named guy if he would like to do the drums. So he came to the band. They made couple demo songs like "Every Moment is an Agony" and "Paganic Souls". They decided to make an demo album. But Hereticius didn't like his own vocals, so they asked Ardyth to do the vocals for couple songs. So he did. After that, he decided to join back. At January 2004 they recorded a mini-cd, which was called "Total Grimness". In summer Valek was kicked out from the band, so Ardyth did the drums. They released an EP called "Verisade". And about a month later, an album, called "Woods of Eternal Darkness". And the rest, as they say, is history...
