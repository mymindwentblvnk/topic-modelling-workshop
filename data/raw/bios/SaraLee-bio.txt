Melancholy-laden Gothic Metal and energetic Rock'n' Roll has been gathered up and melted down in SaraLee's music. 
It all began in Central Finland in the year 2000. The dynamic trio of Joonas, Saurus and Clansman, who had already initiated their common musical journey in early 1990's, was joined by guitarist Juha. Partaking in the recordings of their first demo 'Black And Hollow' was also the keyboard/vocal artist Anne, who enjoyed the SaraLee ride up until Summer 2005, when she had to change scenery because of her studies and career. At this point Ari stepped in.  As a result of a coincidence Kimmo joined the band as second guitarist in Summer 2002. Around this time SaraLee took its final form as Joonas left the burden of guitar-playing solely for others to bear.

At first SaraLee gained renown under the name 'Restless', but was rebaptised in late 2003.

Despite their atmospheric live appearances, recordings-wise, the demos 'Black And Hollow' and 'When Little Things Die' failed to further the SaraLee cause. However their third demo effort 'Evil In Us' was the light that flung doors wide open.

In SaraLee's music combine strong melodies, the energy of rock and passion. Stylistically the band occupies territory somewhere between rock and metal, with influences from Goth.

In Summer 2004 the band gathered up and released their demos as the 'Demo(n)s' compilation, which in little under a year sold nearly a thousand copies at gigs and through the SaraLee website.

Their music has also been featured on a few other compilations, the latest of which is 'Keep On Dooming In The Free World'  a joint release by Firebox Records and Inferno Magazine. The featured SaraLee song is 'Dance', which dates back to late 2004 when the band was in studio recording new material. 'Dance' is also SaraLee's first release on Firebox  the single, in addition featuring the songs 'Cries A River' and the demo version of 'Everytime' was released on the 23rd of November 2005.

In 2006 they released their debut album 'Darkness Between' and in 2008 their second album 'Damnation To Salvation'. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/SaraLee">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
