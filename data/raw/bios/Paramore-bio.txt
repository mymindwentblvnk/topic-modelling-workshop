Paramore is an American rock band formed in Franklin, Tennessee, United States in 2003. The band currently consists of Hayley Williams (vocals, keyboard), Taylor York (guitar) and Zac Farro (drums).

Paramore, as a quartet, released their debut studio album, All We Know Is Falling, in 2005. The band rose to prominence in 2007 after the release of the hit single Misery Business from their second studio album Riot!. Crushcrushcrush and  That's What You Get were released as the following singles experiencing commercial success. The band was nominated for "Best New Artist" at the 2008 Grammy Awards. The band announced the official line-up addition of Taylor York in June 2009 prior to the release of Brand New Eyes due later the same year. Josh Farro (guitar) and his brother Zac Farro left the band the following year, resulting in Paramore to continue as a trio.

From 2013 to 2014, Paramore released several singles from the self-titled album, including the singles Still Into You and Ain't It Fun. The latter became the band's highest peaking single as well as their first Top 10 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and earned the band their first Grammy award for "Best Rock Song" the following year. At the end of 2015, it was reported Jeremy Davis (bass guitar) left the band.

In 2017, Zac Farro officially rejoined the band, prior to the release of their fifth studio album, "After Laughter". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Paramore">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
