L'ordre du Temple a solo project from Venice, Italy created in 2003 but overall it is mainly the project of one man called Count David, a scene veteran of projects such as BURIAL PLACE, LEGION DEL SOLE NUCLEARE, ENETH, DOLCINIAN and FOURTH MONARCHY. There are various bands that influenced the music of l'O.d.T but the main influencial were Summoning, Nokturnal Mortum or the early releases by Dimmu Borgir, to which a medieval touch was added. All the song of L'O.d.T are inspired by the history of the Knights Templar and all their secrets.
