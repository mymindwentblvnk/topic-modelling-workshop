Born in 1947, pianist, vocalist, and post-minimalist composer Jordan De La Sierra (his birth name is Jordan Stenberg) is one of the pioneers of new age music, though his work predated the industry genre. Born in California's San Joaquin Valley, De La Sierra's childhood was well-rounded. Not only did he pursue music -- with training in classical vocal and piano traditions -- he was an avid basketball player and moviegoer. At 15, he and his pop band at the time recorded their first single, "The Voice in the Wind" b/w "Every Time It Rains" for Hollywood's Joli label. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jordan+De+La+Sierra">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
