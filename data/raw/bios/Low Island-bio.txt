Formed in Oxford in 2016, Low Island are instinctive shape-shifters, darting between the uplifting electronica and intimate ballads that have characterised their 4 EPs. It was a step that was both deliberate and natural: "there was a euphoria we didnâ€™t always get from indie gigs, but a connection to songs and musicians we felt was missing from club nights".

Fiercely independent, and born out a shared musical upbringing encompassing jazz, indie, classical and dance music, theirs is a soundtrack to a 20s scattered with romantic and professional failure; melancholic, but quietly optimistic. Carlos, Jamie, Felix and Jacob follow in the lineage of Oxford artists; tenacious, free-spirited, and with a musical horizon of boundless possibility.

In April 2021 they released their debut album, under their own terms, self-managed and on their own label 'Emotional Interference'. To widespread critical acclaim their debut album reached #17 in the Official UK Album Sales Charts. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Low+Island">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
