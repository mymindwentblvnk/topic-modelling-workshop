The Abandonment are a five piece metal/thrash outfit from Melbourne, Australia. Infusing a range of influences from the technical proficiency of tech bands such as The Red Chord, The End, Necrophagist and The Dillinger Escape Plan , to the sludgy components of The Rivalry (Aus) and hardcore elements of Mindsnare, they ensue to cater for the pallets of a variety of fans. 

Their highly successful and now sold out demo (2005) was quickly backed up by their debut EP Deja Desparu (2006) both through Sightline Records / Shock Records. 

This was followed up with the much anticipated full length entitled Ephemeral, released on the 26th of February 2010 on Trial and Error Records.
