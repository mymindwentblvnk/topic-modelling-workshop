Fortunately the Berlin Wall was torn down already. If it hadn’t, Desilence would not exist. The band consists of three Metal Heads out of East - and two out of the former West - Berlin.

First and for most, Desilence is committed to Thrash Metal, without being just another fragment in the mass of bands in either the traditional or modern trends. Desilence does not go with the flow, but strikes in right in the middle between the two camps joining them together. This comes about through versatile musical surprises and strong, diversified arrangements.

The song writing motto: no aimless clash, no pop-smoothing, but methodical and sophisticated deconstruction.

Desilence is the first professional musical demolition company.

In this spirit, five musicians have recorded an album with a brute and energetic musical force. Their symbol and hallmark - the wrecking ball - is wreaking havoc not only with the music, but also acoustically as well as visually. The live performance translate onstage, the concept of heavy musical deconstruction.

Their success speaks loudly for the band: the self-produced Demo, which had thousand prints, was sold out fast and received unanimous first-class reviews from print and online magazines as well as radio. 

The band´s popularity is still growing. They have played several national and international concerts, festivals, building a world wide, loyal fan base without label support.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Desilence">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
