Freak of Nature is a rock band from Walbrzych, Poland. 
FON was formed by Ar, Raf and Wall during the autumn season of 2002 in Walbrzych... after rehearsing time in the gloomy studio 'Edo' the former factory for mining FON members recorded demo-version of their first songs...the person responsible for recordings was Piotr 'Gutek' Migatulski... with this material they started their first tour...during this period of time they played for more than 60 concerts apart from this participation in various festivals and music contests....FON gained the audience appreciation and was also awarded with so many trophies for the Best Band Award:

...with the means gathered during the FON first tour they succeeded to record their first album titled 'Neurotic States'...the work on this album started at the beginning of 2004 in 'Radio Gdansk' recording studios... the recording engineer for this album was Michal Mielnik whereas the producers were Tomek 'Bonar' Bonarowski and FON themselves... the work on this album took longer than expected due to the fact that FON kept their concert tour during the recording time...while the recording was still in progress a few songs were aired on the 'trojka' radio station...the one who aired it on his own broadcast was Piotr Kaczkowski... he also recommended the songs 'intro' and 'bad dreams' for a mixed hits album 'minimax pl' which was to be published by the 'trojka' radio station...

the FON first album was finally released and had its premiere in March 2005... no one predicted that it would be given such enthusiastic welcome from both the audience and critics...that was the beginning of 'neurotic states' tour... the biggest gig of this tour was during 'Przystanek Woodstock' festival where FON entertained a crowd of more than a few hundred thousand people... it was over 2 years when the band stayed living in tours resulting in all group members were extremely tired which ended up in some misunderstandings and conflicts...in November the moment of hard decision finally came when Wall decided to leave...

after a long-lasting and intensive search Wojtek 'Łoś' Karel joined the group as a bass player...and FON was back on the road playing concerts again...the group took part in 'Heineken open air' festival...in between the tour they started preparing material for their second album, which was interrupted by Ar's illness...that was the most difficult times for FON and its members...while waiting for Ar to undergo the operation the band's activities and schedules were suspended...fortunately the operation was successful and at the beginning of 2007 Ar and Raf met and decided to start work away at FON's second album... in the meantime Bartek 'Bart' Bumczynski replaced 'Łoś' as a bass player and with this new re-formed band they started on the new album... hard-work during rehearsals resulted in refreshingly new material...new instrumental arrangements and vocal interpretation with Polish lyrics enriched new quality in the FON's music... in June 2007 the band met with Andrzej Karp in studio 'Sonus' in suburbs of Warsaw...22 songs were recorded and 13 were chosen for second album of FON... in this production the top Polish producers had their part : Leszek Kaminski, Adam Toczko, Tomek Bonarowski, Jasiu Kidawa... and also some friends : Alek Korecki - sax . Tomek Butryn - accordion, piano; Kasia Miernik - harp, Tomek Osiecki - sitar, mandolin, Leszek Laskowski - pedal steel guitar, Michal Jelonek - string instruments , Beata Kosowska - harmonica... the album is titled 'Fabryka Zła'. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Freak+Of+Nature">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
