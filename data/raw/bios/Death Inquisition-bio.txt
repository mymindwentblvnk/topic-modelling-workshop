Death Inquisition is a thrash metal band hailing from Tulsa, Oklahoma.

The first concept that the band had was in the vein of war metal. Before Death Inquisition came to existence, Matt Dorr/Blake Harper/Cody Creitz set out to create grindy war metal in the vein of Archgoat and Blasphemy. Though, this concept was trashed very quickly.

Shortly after, Duncan McDuffie was recruited as a vocalist, creating a 4-piece band. Death Inquisition took their sound in a blackened thrash direction and found success in doing so. They recorded a gritty demo entitled "Greatest Shits Vol. 1", which recieved good feedback.

In 2011, Duncan Mcduffie stepped down from vocal duties and joined the ranks as a second guitar player. Brandon Fitzgerald was accepted into the band as the new frontman. Death Inquisition changed their thrashing style at this point. They loosened up on their strong black metal ties and incorporated more oldschool bay area thrash into their sound. 

"Undying Legions" will be Death Inquisition's first studio release, coming out in mid-March. It will feature 4 tracks recorded at Blade Studios. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Death+Inquisition">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
