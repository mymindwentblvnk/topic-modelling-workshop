In March 07 Triton decided to make brutal (or „straight-in-the-face”) music again. Grabbing his Jackson for the first time in nearly ten years, he asked his old pal Sir if he’s interested in singing and writing some lyrics. Of course there was no way his bro could say no. Luck was on their side anyway as one hell of a drummer (look for suffocatebastard at myspace to witness his quality) and the Sir’s personal Doctor – let’s name him Dok – was eager to join the project....as the bass-player. 


At the end of the same month the first sessions were started and Apocalypze was born. Yet nameless though, the first goal was to get the shit started not worrying about descriptions or definitions of the sound. Eventually June 07 the three dudes decided to bename their ideas of “funny evil music”. Apocalypze (yea – with “z” cause it looks cool, fool...) should be the word that describes this mix of genres very well. 


Being influenced by a large variety of Death- and Black Metal Bands like Suffocation, Vital Remains, Samael and Dissection the band tries to find its own unique sound and appearance. All of the members are more or less potential gamers as well, so obviously “No Escape” deals with the theme of Resident Evil 4 while “Reign in Chaos” is dedicated to the evil god Chatturgha, one of the main antagonists of the game “Eternal Darkness”.
