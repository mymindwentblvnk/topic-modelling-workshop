Underground Canopy officially formed in 2016 after jamming and playing covers of Flying Lotus, Madlib and J. Dilla for several years. Band members Jonathan Aréna (Keys), Warren Dongué (Bass), Necky Gomis (Trumpet/Flugelhorn), Alfredo Grooveton (Drums) and Jeremy Talon (Guitar) members met in the south of France during their 20s and immediately connected over their shared passion for hip-hop and instrumental music. The approach to compositions was always to transform the vibe of jazzy hip-hop into hand made live music. They’ve played dozen of shows throughout France, including support slots for Alan Mion’s legendary jazz funk outfit Cortex and rising Japanese jazz band WONK. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Underground+Canopy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
