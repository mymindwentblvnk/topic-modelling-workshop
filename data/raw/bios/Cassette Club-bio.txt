Ben Macklin and Tom Hammond use their obsessive knowledge of all things electronic and soulful to create irresistibly good-looking pop music. Rich and sophisticated, the vocals provide the perfect accompaniment to the clean metronomic beats peppered with sharp synths. Flawlessly executed and irrepressibly feel-good, Cassette Club have perfected the art of electrosexy. With influences ranging from ABC to Daft Punk, Go West to Justice, Depeche Mode to MGMT, their debut album is a colourful afternoon in the sun - Cassette Club style.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cassette+Club">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
