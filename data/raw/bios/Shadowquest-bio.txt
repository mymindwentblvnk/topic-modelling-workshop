Musically, ShadowQuest is a mixture of many influences. Traces of  Dionysus and Stratovarius can be heard, spiced with heavier guitar work signed by  Widerberg/Huss. 
With a musical landscape in  the vein of ”Painkiller” and ”Keeper of the Seven Keys”, Patrik’s added scents and flavours of Avantasia and Iron Maiden combined with the pounding yet sophisticated bass lines from Jari makes this a unique metal combo.

Members: Ronny Milianowicz (Dionysos, Saint Deamon), Patrik J Sellyby (Bloodbound), Peter Huss (Shining), Jari Kainulainen (Stratovarius, Masterplan) and Ragnar Widerberg (Witherscape). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Shadowquest">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
