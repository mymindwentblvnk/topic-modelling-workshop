Absynthium came to existence in November 1996 when Peter Bloemen (guitars) and Kevin Schutters (bass, now in Emeth) joined forces. Through time the sound evolved to a modern death/thrash metal with an identity of it's own. Monstrously downtuned guitars create a wall of sound and the whole turns into a whirlwind of melody, rage and groove. Several line-upchanges were needed to form a strong and stable alliance which the band is today. This evolution took form in the release of the 'Hatestorm' demo on February 12, 2005.
