The Susie Arioli Swing Band was started by singer Susie Arioli and guitar player Jordan Officer in 1997. 

Their first big show was at the 1998 Montreal Jazz Festival where, after playing an outdoor show, they were invited to open for Ray Charles at the prestigious Place des Arts. Since then, the band has become a favourite of Canadian and international audiences with four best-selling jazz albums and tours of North America, Europe, and Asia. Arioli is known for her unaffected and sincere interpretations of old songs. The most recent album is a departure, and features six lesser-known ballads by country songwriter Roger Miller. All four albums feature Jordan Officer on guitar and violin, and as an arranger.  Learn to Smile Again was also produced by JOfficer. The most recent release is a CD/DVD of their show at the 2006 Montreal International Jazz Festival at the Spectrum and a fifth album, currently being recorded, is scheduled for release in September 2010.
