Formed after Johnny Hedlund was kicked out of Nihilist (who actually split-up and reformed as Entombed to avoid firing him directly).

Unleashed are credited to be one of the first death metal groups to write songs about Viking/Scandinavian history and heritage instead of more typical subjects like death and gore.

Members also involved in Bajen Death Cult. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Unleashed">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
