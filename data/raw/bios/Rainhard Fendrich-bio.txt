Rainhard JÃ¼rgen Fendrich (born 27 February 1955 in Vienna) is an Austrian singer, composer, entertainer, and actor. He is one of the most successful Austropop musicians. His lyrics are written in Viennese German, and he is very popular in Austria, but less in other German-speaking countries, and by far less known in non-German speaking ones. His song from 1990, I am from Austria (its lyrics are, except for this one line, in Viennese German) is still popular in Austria. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rainhard+Fendrich">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
