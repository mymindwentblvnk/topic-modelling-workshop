Faded Grave was created in October of 2007 by Rahavort. Faded Grave is a one man band and has vowed to stay that way. It is still not known if any of the songs created will be played live if by some chance live members are found. Lyrics consist of the topics of the supernatural, death, depression, war, religion, hatred, etc. Faded Grave has been influenced by many different artists and genres, mainly black metal and death metal. Bands like Burzum, Xasthur, Carpathian Forest have had a profound impact on this artist's sound. The audio is aimed to be rather raw, but still heavy nonetheless. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Faded+Grave">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
