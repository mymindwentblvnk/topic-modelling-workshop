Dream Diary is a band from Brooklyn, NY that plays jangly pop songs inspired by the Smiths, Lloyd Cole, the Supremes, and everything in between. They formed as a quartet in late 2009 and released their self-recorded debut album, 'You Are The Beat', on Kanine Records in 2011. 

They are described by Brooklyn Vegan as “NYC’s answer to The Pastels/Field Mice” and by Allmusic.com as  "ultra-sweet, C-86-loving indie pop".
