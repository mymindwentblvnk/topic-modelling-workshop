When they meet in September 2007, Benjamin (voice), Hanoi O. (guitar/voice) and Mervyn Sz. (guitar/programming) are fond of extreme metal, and 80s culture... They soon decide to make a band, and to create a new style, in which they could give vent to their passion and fantasy. Thus was born Pavillon Rouge, whose musical influences are various: the Black Metal bands Aborym, Emperor, BlackLodge, but also Ministry, Nine Inch Nails and the 80s new wave...

The three musicians have different musical experiences: Benjamin has been playing since 2003 in the critically acclaimed Indus metal band Sybreed, Hanoi O. used to be the singer of the black metal band Osirion, and Mervyn Sz. has taken part in KHK, the cult electro-wave project from Budapest.. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pavillon+Rouge">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
