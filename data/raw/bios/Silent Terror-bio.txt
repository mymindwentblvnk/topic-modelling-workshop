Silent Terror is a Moscow, Russia, nu metal band. The line up is pretty the same as in other nu metal bands: two guitars, bass, drums and keys/samples. But in some places you can obviously hear the influence of such genres as punk rock and even ska music. The name is controversial and is claimed to mean lots of things. In different moods members of the band refer to it with both satirical and serious approach.

The Band started in 2005 when three friends (Yura Chizhov, Artem Gribkov and Eugene Gurevich) finally decided to make their dreams come true. With no experience behind their backs they originally played punk rock under the same name. But with time and new members who joined them they tried to create more sophisticated music.

Since then the band progressed and In 2007 began giving concerts in moscow clubs Tochka, XO, Relax and others, opening such bands as save and tent.

Yura Chizhov_Lead Guitar and Vocals
Oleg Gusev_Rhytm Guitar
Artem Gribkov_Bass
Eugene Gurevich_Drums
Adel Protasova_Keys/samples
