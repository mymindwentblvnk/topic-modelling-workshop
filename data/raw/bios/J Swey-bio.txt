J Swey is an independent rapper and producer from Stockholm, Sweden, with a style featuring dark vocals over rich, 808-heavy trap beats. A frequent collaborator with trap producer Azide, he started posting early cuts on Soundcloud in 2016 before breaking into the mainstream with his debut single God and the Devil in early 2017. He quickly followed up with the release of the first of three collaborative albums with Azide, Xelfmade, and began a period of high productivity: from 2017 to 2018, he dropped 24 singles, three albums, and five music videos as well as performing with Swedish rap group ODZ and Frej Larsson in Stockholm.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/J+Swey">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
