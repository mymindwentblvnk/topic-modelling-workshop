With a discography of over 50 albums, Lee "Scratch" Perry (born Rainford Hugh Perry, on March 20, 1936, in Kendal, Jamaica) is a reggae and dub artist, who has been highly influential in the development and acceptance of reggae and dub music in Jamaica and overseas. He is amongst some of the first producers to create the sound we now know as 'dub'. He employs numerous pseudonyms, such as Pipecock Jaxxon and The Upsetter.

His musical career began in the 1950's, continuing through the 50's and 60's with him forming his own record label 'Upsetter' in 1968, and his studio band 'The Upsetters'. In 1973 he built his own studio in his back garden called 'The Black Ark' where he continued to produce music and artists, such as Bob Marley and Max Romeo, using only very minimalistic equipment and his sheer genius.  Having his own recording studio enabled him to produce his best work, but it was not to last. The Ark burned down in the early 80's, which Lee Perry stakes claim to. In the late 80's he met Mad Professor, Neil Fraser with whom he began to produce collaborations, and his career was re-kindled. He continues to produce and create even at the age of 73
