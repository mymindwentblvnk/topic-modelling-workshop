Originated from Salgótarján, Hungary, Corrodal started at the beginning of 2008 with members: Zoltán Angyal & Attila Márton (guitars), Gergely Bakos (vocals), Mihály Györe (bass) and Ferenc Kőnig (drums). After the singer left, the band decided to continue in a fully instrumental form and try to find the path to create a unique sound for their music. To achive this, two new member joined the band in early 2009, Viktor Kovács & Gergely Soltész, who played on authentic native instruments such as didgeridoos and various percussions (djembe, darbuka). Their first album "Xei" was released in april 2009. Second album called "Lathe of Heaven" has been released in March 2013, which is based on the sci-fi novel The Lathe Of Heaven, written by american author Ursula K. Le Guin. The end of 2013 has brought big changes: the two acoustic musicians nad gutiarist Attila Márton have left the band, making it a trio. The new sounding had become more clearer yet more psychedelic and experimetnal at the same time owing to a new band member Péter Mészáros (alias Pedro Helvete) who provides massive effect layers. The third album of the band will be released in 2015.
