Styptic was formed in the year 2003 in Nis, Serbia. The band recorded their first EP, "Junkyard", in 2005, also making their music video debut that year with the song "Blocked". This was followed by another EP, "Mode", in 2007, and another music video for the song "Afterlie" in 2009. In 2010, the band entered the studio to record their first full-length record, which took its final form with the help of producer Marko Živanović after three grueling years as the studio album "Noesis" in 2013. The album is made up of eleven original songs and is set to be released in the spring of 2014. Over the years, Styptic has accumulated a wealth of experience as a touring band as well, having played a large number of independent gigs, as well as taking part in numerous festivals.
