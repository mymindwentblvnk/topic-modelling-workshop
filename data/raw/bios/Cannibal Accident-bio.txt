In the beginning of the year 2007 Lenets and Kolkka were boozing at their hometown Turku and they ended up in a local rock club. There were several bands playing and the name of the game was grindcore. Yeah, the bands played well but something was missing. Where the hell were delicious mosh parts that Napalm Death and S.O.D. used to have? To tell you the truth, if your mosh is good then your song will be memorable.

Cannibal Accident was founded to bring you oldschool grindcore with quality mosh parts.

Vesa B.D. Salonen joined C.A. as bass player during late 2008. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cannibal+Accident">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
