A folk metal act from Edmonton, Canada.
Members: Mateusz Kloc All instruments, Vocals 

In his own words (from official facebook page:)
"A band dedicated to creating more music that satisfies a peculiar and non solidified genre of metal.
I have listened to a variety of bands such as Amorphis, Ensiferum, Kalmah, Moonsorrow, Turisas and Wintersun.
All of which I find share a certain level of similarity and style that I wish to promote. This band is dedicated to creating the same type of music as the previously mentioned bands.
I focus my efforts on writing about nature based themes and intermingling them with personal experience and/or stories."
