Nox Doloris was founded in 2008 as a black metal band. The first LP "Possession" was released on the label Grailight Productions in 2013. A tour in support of the album took place in Russia and Ukraine in the same year.
The single "Plagues and Betrayer" was released in 2016. The sound became heavier and darker. Oriental motifs and ethnic instruments were increasingly appearing in music.
After that  the second album "Khemet" and a video for the song 'Ancient Legacy Burns were released. "Khemet" is dedicated to the dark side of the mythology of Ancient Egypt.
The band has a rich concert experience and pays great attention to performance on stage. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nox+Doloris">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
