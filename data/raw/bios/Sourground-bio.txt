Sourground is an aggressive metal band hailing from Long Island, NY. The band uses a unique blend of detuned tone, harmony, and thrash that transcends the current metal genre.

The current line-up (Jimmy Perini, Dave Barber, James Cusano and John Cusano) formed in January of 2004. There was an immediate chemistry between the four, which lead to the release of their first demo in April of 2004 entitled, “Blind Cycle.”

After playing numerous shows during the summer of 2004 it was apparent that there was an overwhelming reaction to the demo, which inspired the band to write more material. After a few months of intense writing, Sourground had finished a 9 song full-length release entitled, “Shades and Echoes.” Recorded in February 2005, the album is a complex mix of numerous styles showcasing the balance of power, speed, groove and control. Every song has its own feel and identity, accentuating the broad influences of each member.

Sourground prides itself on their live shows, bringing an onslaught of energy and confidence. The band lives to play and always delivers a high-powered performance.

Through hard work and dedication, Sourground is at full throttle on their musical assault. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sourground">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
