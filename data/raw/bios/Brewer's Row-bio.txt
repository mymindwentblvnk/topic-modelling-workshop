Brewer’s Row takes its name from its attic practice space just steps from a neighboring Pittsburgh brewery. Formed in the summer of 2005, the group sought to showcase a collection of Nicholas Hohman’s music and to build and grow their original works.

The Steel Town natives’ roots are recognizable in a repertoire of bittersweet melodies that take influence from the likes of Bruce Springsteen and Patty Griffin, while building three-part harmony choruses unique to the group alone.

Singer/songwriter, Nicholas Hohman's rhythmically engaging and emotionally captivating lyrics make him a stand-out in the world of roots rock. Add (sister) Leah’s soulful voice and (dad) Mark’s distinct guitar play to the mix, the group skillfully weaves an intended urgency into character-driven narratives. (Cousin) Jarrett Sallows on drums and Corry Drake on bass complete the deal, and make Brewer's Row a band to you'll want to listen to, and tell your friends about. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Brewer%27s+Row">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
