Nefret is a Turkish rap group, formed in 1999 by Ceza and Dr. Fuchs.

Dr. Fuchs was required to fulfill his military obligation as per Turkish law and join the Turkish Armed Forces. During the time when Fuchs was away, Ceza worked on and released his own solo album. Later, Sagopa Kajmer was to use this against Ceza and accused Ceza of "selling out" his friend.

Upon Dr. Fuchs's arrival from the millitary, the two decided to dissolve the group, fulfill different ambitions and go their seperate ways. Dr. Fuchs changed his name to Fuchs, and joined another rap group called "Istanbul Attack". He also played a lead role in a major bank advertisement on TV.

There is no information concerning Ceza and Fuchs ever coming back to reform 'Nefret' as of today.

Nefret was one of the most well-known rap groups in Turkey, helping to launch one of the strongest rap communities outside of the United States.  It established a tendency to mix in African-American styles of lyricism with traditional Turkish rhythms, instrumental styles, and cultural references.  They eschew the "gangster" style that Western rap is unfortunately labeled as, and keep almost to themselves in a distinct Eastern style. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nefret">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
