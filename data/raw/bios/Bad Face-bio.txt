Everything began in February 2004. Brothers Skull (ex Krabathor, Martyr, Master) and Rad (ex Stagnant, Hypnos, Shaark) made the fatal decision to cooperate. A couple of months later joined the brothers Pawel (ex Decay) as a singer and Espin (ex Mouchys) as a bass guitar player. And things turned to serious work. 

In September 2004 the group recorded their first mini-CD Good Time To Wake Up. 

In October 2004 Dany took his place as a second guitarist. One more change followed, Ritchie replaced Espin, who quit. The Bad Face was stabilized and established.

Since Spring 2005 Bad Face has become ready for public performances. In the end of 2005 Bad Face recorded two-songs promo Speak With Us. The CD also included a video Speak With Me.

Guitarist Dany finished in January 2007. Bad Face decided to carry on as a four men group. It is good to have more space on the stage anyway.

Summer 2007, the crucial moment - first CD Emotions Burn was released. 
At the same time a new face came in Bad Face - guitarist Zuhan. More men - more show. That's the rule. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bad+Face">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
