Greensleeves was founded in 1993, when guitarists Victor Schmidlin (then also lead singer) and Cicero Baggio, bassist Joao Koerner and drummer Giulliano Settim recorded the band’s first demo tape and started touring in Curitiba, Brazil.

In 1994, Jim Marc Douglas (ex-Icarus) joined as lead singer. In 1995, the band released the demo Immortal, recorded at Drum Studio, in Rio de Janeiro, engineered by Nico Rezende and mixed by Marcelo Sussekind. Following the release, the band performed in Curitiba and other cities in the state of Parana, Brazil.

In 1997, Gui Nogueira replaces Douglas as lead singer, and Luis Requiao (ex-Shades Before Dawn) replaces Giulliano as drummer. With the new lineup, the band moved from classic heavy metal to prog metal. However, shortly after that Luis Requiao left the band, to be replaced by Rhandu Lopez. Months later, nevertheless, Greensleeves was disbanded.

The band resumed activities only 9 years later, to start recording The Elephant Truth, with lead singer Gui Nogueira, guitarists Victor Schmidlin and Cicero Baggio, bassist Joao Koerner and drummer Marlon Marquis (ex-Dynahead).
