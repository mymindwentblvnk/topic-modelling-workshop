In summer 2002 a man named Valery (vocals/guitar) arrived to Vitebsk city for studying. In cooperation with his faculty mate Constantin (drums) they made up their minds to create a metal band. Soon, a bass player Maxim (Maxx) joined them. This lineup of the band was called TANATOS. After several rehearsals the second guitar player Alexander (Grozny) has been invited. He played in VICARIUS FILII DEI before. The first sample became the recording of cover version of Death's “Lack of Comprehension” song for forthcoming compilation dedicated to this band. Unfortunately this compilation hasn’t appeared. Next, Valery abandoned the band. Left in three, guys accepted Vitaly as a vocalist into the band, and the first firm lineup was formed. Maxx and Grozny decided to change the name of the band. Between many proposals they chose Unlucky Buried because it has never been met in the ocean of metal bands names.

After two months of existence the band has debuted in a metal show together with Interior Wrath and Kutgar bands and a week later they received the invitation to play with Kutgar and #####. Together they visited many places of the region and taken part in a number of festivals (in one of them the band wins the first prize for SLAYER’s cover version “Dead Skin Mask”). Next, band loses the vocalist and the drummer. After short period of time drummer’s place has been taken by Dmitry (Diky) and vocals was temporally performed by Grozny. After participating in a couple of shows with this new lineup they decided to invite one more vocalist – Andrew. At the same time they record the first demo “You’re unique… our Death”. To support the material the band taked part in concert warming up Grenouer band together with VELD. After recording this material Andrew has been recruited to the military service.

Some time later Yaroslav (Yary) has been invited as a second guitar player. With this lineup the band played together with legendary Mortem. At the same time one new vocalist Alexey (Alex) joined the band (he played bass in VELD before) and started translating all lyrics into English. Also, he closely deals with art-concept of the band. Soon, Diky enters an university in Minsk and drops out of stuff for six years. Due to the lack of drummers in city, the guys decide to use the drum-machine which is still used in their recordings and shows. The first show with new stuff the band plays on warm-up with the Ukrainian band Hyperion and the local VELD. After several shows in native city the band goes to Rechitza to take part in METAL CROWD TOUR 2006 together with BESTIAL DEFORM, APOCRYPHAL and I.N.F., to Saint-Petersburg, where they participate in First Open Contest in the field of metal and around metal club music industry “Soul Of Metal” and to Minsk, where the musicians have honor to perform on warm-up with polish grind core legend Dead Infection.

From autumn 2007 to spring 2008 the band records the debut album on Unburied Studio (the home-studio of Grozny). In April 2008 after participating in MASS CRUELTY FEST Yary abandons the band. As the result of numerous experiments with the sound and endless changes of musical structures in recording process many compositions has been changed greatly, what is evidence of endless musical development of the band, which has never limited itself within death metal, mixing up compositions with different metal styles elements. In may 2009 on More Hate Productions the album “Blast from the underground” has bean released. Beside six own compositions, the album includes cover version for the song “Sothis” by Vader and extra bonus – video clip “Inexplicable Need To Kill”. Cover art, album design and logo were developed by a talented artist from Vitebsk Sergey Kisel, with whom the band is planning to cooperate in the future. Nowadays the band is busy with composing new music material and promoting the album.
