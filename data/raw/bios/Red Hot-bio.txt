Red Hot is a ten-piece, black-suited rhythm & blues revue from the city of Molde in Norway. We started out in 2005, inspired by blues acts like Delbert McClinton and The Blues Brothers, though over the years our music has grown to include elements of jazz, funk, rock and soul just as our own tastes have evolved. We like to think we boast a unique estethic on today's music scene, perhaps aurally reminiscent of classic acts like Chicago or Blood, Sweat & Tears, and visually conjuring up the look and feel of a classy Motown act, black suits and red ties galore.

In 2007 we won the "Union Blues Cup" at the Notodden Blues Festival, and the following year we released our debut album "Hotter Than Georgia Asphalt" with special appearances by Norwegian guitar virtuoso Vidar Busk. The same year we also did several concerts with Vidar at Moldejazz, a festival that has since greeted us with open arms and sold-out crowds in both 2009 and 2010.

These days we're releasing our brand new EP "My Arrival" , with excerpts being listenable on this very page. We sincerely hope you all enjoy it!
