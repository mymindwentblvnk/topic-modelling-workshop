Atretic Intestine is a five member death metal group
formed in 2006 at Finland. The band has released two demos and two self-published MCDs and finally in May 2012 released their first full-lenght album entitled "ENCASED" which contains 10 tracks of death, gore & sickness.

Their music combines elements from various sub-genres of death
metal: Agonizing aspects and sinister melodies from old school death metal. Pounding riffs with groovy rhythms and guttural vocals from brutal death metal. Finished with rapid blast beats and twisted harmonies and speed picking from modern technical death metal.

The band has played numerous gigs around Finland with various finnish and foreign death metal acts and are currently on the lookout for more gigs. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Atretic+Intestine">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
