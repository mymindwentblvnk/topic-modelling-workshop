Reasonable Doubt is a band based on old-school thrash mixed with new school European metal. Taking hardcore into the mix, the Kent based band provide a sound that is as fresh and captivating as any of today's metal bands. Their live shows are intense and exciting, evoking power and passion from the pits to the bar.

At every show the band are churning up the crowds with bone-crunching breakdowns, massive riffs and driven by a machine gun rhythm section. This is all fused together with both melodic and aggressive vocal dynamics in a maelstrom of sonic savagery.

The band's debut EP "Built To Resist" has recently been released on Casket Music (home of Panic Cell, Forever Never, I-Def-I, etc). The CD has been a great success thus far, already receiving good reviews and airplay on most of the UK's rock radio stations including Kerrang and Totalrock, and has even been played by Bruce Dickinson on his BBC 6 radio show. Their immense live shows have also gained them endorsements with ESP guitars and Peavey amplification, as well as gigs with some of the Uk's best bands, including Raging Speedhorn, Head-On and Forever Never, as well as Dutch hardcore legends Born From Pain. After a short hiatus to write new material, the band is back, stronger than ever, with a new demo coming soon. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Reasonable+Doubt">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
