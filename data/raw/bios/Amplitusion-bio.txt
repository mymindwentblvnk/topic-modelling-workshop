“Extreme Soundtrack Metal” typecasted the debut offering, ‘Darth Brutalus’, a 78-minute opus including an instrumental dynamic of experimental soundtrack music with extreme heavy metal. Anthems such as Hypothalamuscle and Darth Brutalus gave way to apercussively acute intensity, with signature attacks of invading guitar-work and relentless double-bass.
Amplitusion contrast traditional (extreme) metal styles of death/doom/satanism, contributing positive lyrical proclamations of empowerment and positivity. At the same time, the visceral invasion of black/thrash/death/power metal is unequivocally present; dynamically articulate and tastefully arranged. Today, the sequel germinating in the studio with Halcyon Records for an even more intense contribution to the world.
The focus for Amplitusion is clear:
ONE GOAL:
To deliver an intensity that hyper-stimulates the ‘experience’ of being human; challenging senses, evoking passion, ultimately crushing extreme- with every second, of every song; every time to every one- instilling a legacy of value for the passion and appreciation of life through music.
