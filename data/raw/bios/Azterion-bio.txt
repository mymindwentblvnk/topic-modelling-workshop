Azterion was created in 12-31- 2000  on  Tres Rios, Cartago, Costa Rica ; mainly because their members wanted to develop a music style which could not be included in any category, but at the same time including elements of many different music styles, which could be adapted to their music.

At the beginning, their style was influenced mainly by black metal, but they were adding also elements of death, thrash, and grindcore; lately their also begin to explore other elements, becoming the avant-garde style part of their music, but never getting apart from the brutal stuff.
