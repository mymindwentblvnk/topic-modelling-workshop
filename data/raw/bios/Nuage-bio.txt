1) Nuage is a nu disco band from Romania, Eastern Europe who wants to develop The Resurrection of the '70's Disco, an ambitious project of six musicians who create their own original music based on the melodic structure and orchestration of the"70's disco sound". Our dream is to start a new movement by which bands live music and vinyl productions can be again powerful and bring an unbounded joy like in the 70's. Nuage's music is a disco style with a “let’s have a good time” feel! We are born in may 2007; the members: Nicu-piano, Filip-guitar, Johnny-bass, Atti-drums and ... Norica-vocals. We are Nuage, come and enjoy our music in concerts!
