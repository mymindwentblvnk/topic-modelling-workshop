A three man army,World War Four are a lot bolder than anything New Zealand has produced so far.
Challenging, gutsy and not afraid to carve their own style into the industry,World War Four deliver a compelling and truculent set of original music, dripping with sincerity and melody.
   Fierce, brutally honest, staunch and passionate, the sound is unique and not influenced by trends or the radio market.
   World War Four is one of the few bands you will hear today that have an original and organic sound in an industry filled with carbon copy clones and pop-hit wannabes. 
  The songs are deep and heartfelt, no disposable chart songs to turn on limp wristed radio programmers, World War Four are beyond that.

  This is about the power of the songs, the power and commitment of the musicians and the integrity to keep it real and keep it honest.

The truth is...World War Four are just as representative of our vibrant and exciting culture as Neil Finn or the black singlet is.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/World+War+Four">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
