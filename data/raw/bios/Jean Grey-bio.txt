There are multiple artists with the name Jean Grey:
*See "Jean Grae" for the social/political female hip hop artist.

1. Jean Grey is the secret identity of the X-Men member Phoenix, with special mutant fire powers. She is also one of the heaviest bands to ever come out of Oregon. Jean Grey hits your ass with the unnecessarily pissed-off brooding of Dead to Fall or Through The Eyes of The Dead but with the 2-step/mosh sensibilities of the likes of Bury Your Dead, while adding their own interjecting guitar lines and drum fills that seal their own style. Seconds into any track you can instantly hear that Jean Grey isn't just another toss-aside band, and with the 80s hard-rock fist-pupmping undertones throughout, there is fun to be had at their live shows time and again.
