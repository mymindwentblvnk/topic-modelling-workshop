Cardiant was formed in the year 2000 by Antti HÃ¤nninen and Dave Alberti. Next to join were Vesa and Valtteri. After trying out with Janne Iivanainen as the singer, Tuomas Helander took over as the frontman. After a few years, Dave Alberti parted ways with the band, and was replaced by Late, Antti's brother. 

Cardiant recorded several demos, before getting a recording deal with Underground Symphony. During the recording of the debut album, Tuomas had severe problems with his voice. As a result, Cardiant was forced to have Janne Saksa as the session singer on the album, and start the search for a new singer. Summer 2005 saw the end of the search, as Tuple Salmela joined the band. 

Cardiant started co-operation with Janne Saksa again on summer 2007 because Tuple Salmela was busy with his other band called Tarot. Illusion Game is taken from their current promo material recorded in the begin of 2007.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cardiant">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
