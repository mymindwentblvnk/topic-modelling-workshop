Russian one man down-tempo death/ funeral doom metal project formed in 1995. Riffs are extremely heavy with slow paces. There are not much information about the band, the only known member of the band is Dmitry Pavlovsky (on vocals) and the other members are unknown. Beyond Horizon has only one self-released demo The Dreamgarden (1995) contains 5 extreme doom metal songs. Its really difficult to find this demo with good quality. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Beyond+Horizon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
