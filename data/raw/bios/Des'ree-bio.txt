Des'ree, born Desiree Weeks on November 30, 1968 in London, England was one of Britain's most successful pop/soul vocalists throughout the 1990s. She changed her name from Desiree Weeks because she preferred a two-syllable name.

In 1994 the hit single "You Gotta Be" hit Billboard Top 5 and was a hit in the UK three times. It also allowed Des'ree to break into America. "You Gotta Be" was also a major hit in the United States, and it was featured in the movie The Next Karate Kid, starring Hilary Swank. The second song from Des'ree's second album, "Crazy Maze" featured in the movie Nothing to Lose. Coincidentally, her last album ("Dream Soldier") featured a song entitled "Nothing to Lose". Her song "Kissing You" featured on the  1996 Baz Luhrman movie "Romeo + Juliet" and is generally considered to be one of her greatest works and a showcase for her distinctive and impressive vocals.

In 1999, she won a Brit Award for the British Female Solo Artist category. Her 2003 release Dream Soldier was considerably less successful.
