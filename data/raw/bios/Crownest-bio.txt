CROWNEST was formed during the August of 2003 at Heraclion Crete by Mick (guitar) and Paul (bass), in an attempt to mix their ideas and influences concerning DOOM DEATH METAL .
The band’s first name was “THEATRE OF ALWAYS” inspired by an earlier concept made by Mick. The rest band members were Kostas (vocals) and Herck (drums, vocals). 
“THEATRE OF ALWAYS” composed two songs, titled “Theatre of Always” and “False Birth” , that were included in the first same title DEMO which was released in August 2003. The recordings took place at Paul’s So coLD Studio who also did the production.
A second guitarist was essential to the band sound. After thinking several options, Panagiotis who had already helped the band by writing and recording a guitar solo on “False Birth” has taken the position.
In the beginning of 2004 the band’s name changed to “CROWNEST” and four new songs were composed. In August of the same year the songs were completed and recorded in band’s home, So coLD Studio.
In October 2005 under very difficult circumstances the second DEMO titled “Isolation” was released. The DEMO included the four new songs, “Infection”, “The Darkest Cellar”, “The Dead Son” and “In These Eyes” as well as the band’s first DEMO “Theatre of Always”. 
When Paul and Herck resigned, the band faced a difficult problem that demanded for careful and mature decisions. Finally the empty place was supplemented by John "soulgazer_13" (bass) and Antonis (drums). Right now CROWNEST is busy composing new songs and the story continues….
