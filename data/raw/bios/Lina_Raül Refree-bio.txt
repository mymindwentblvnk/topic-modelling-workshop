The duo of Spanish producer Raül Refree (Rosalía, Sonic Youth’s Lee Ranaldo) and Lina, a Portuguese singer renowned for her haunting interpretations of Amalia's classic repertoire.

Lina is a multidisciplinary artist: She studied theatre and performed, sung opera but Fado is her true identity. Lina is genuine and deep, her voice extremely moving. Although coming from the universe of classical Fado, Lina embraced this new project approaching it from a totally new point of view with a dare that caracterizes her strength.

Raül Refree is an artist of a kind and one of the most innovative european producers of the last decade. 
Always interested on popular music, he has given a new perspective to Flamenco, producing and playing with artist like Rocío Márquez, Niño de Elche or Kiko Veneno and he’s done astonishing duo albums with Rosálía and Sílvia Pérez Cruz.

He’s preparing an album together with Lee Ranaldo of legendary Sonic Youth, and has worked with the african legend Cheikh Lô. Those are a few of the eclèctic range projects to which he lends his unique approach. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lina_Ra%C3%BCl+Refree">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
