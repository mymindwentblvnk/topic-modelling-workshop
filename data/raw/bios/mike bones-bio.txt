From Mike Bones:

"I grew up in New Jersey, in the same city as the talented and critically-acclaimed songwriter and performer Ted Leo.  May I suggest then, that I am proof that even in a vast cesspool like New Jersey, there is nothing in the water.  I taught myself to play the guitar and I achieved a Catholic high school education.  At first chance, I moved across the river to New York City where I still live.  

"I got a place in Williamsburg, Brooklyn with a friend from home.  The mid to late Nineties, as history has clearly shown us, was a creative time for that particular neighborhood, where many bands that are celebrated today got their start.  Sadly, I didn't see or play in any of those bands.  I used hard drugs daily and played the guitar a bit.  I wasted hours pondering anything.  I rarely left my block.  Sometimes I slept with women.  

"Having survived the peculiar and troublesome existential dilemma that is late adolescence, I got my shit together and wound up living in the Lower East Side of Manhattan, which I preferred to Brooklyn.  I started playing in bands and writing terrible songs.  I managed to have relationships that lasted longer than a few months.  I had a mildly interesting job that paid well and sent me to nice places.  I bought clothes by Ralph Lauren.

"Then I got serious about writing songs.  

"I had to give up the job.  A frustrated girlfriend left me.  The clothes have holes in them and the rent is late.  The usual.  But I suspect the songs have gotten a little better.  Things are looking up."
