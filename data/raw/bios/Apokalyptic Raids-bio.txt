APOKALYPTIC RAIDS was formed in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1998 by Heavy Metal fans.

The band's references are the 1980's, when VENOM emerges. Sons of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, they united KISS' theatrics to the heaviness of BLACK SABBATH and the aggression of MOTÖRHEAD and Hardcore Punk. At that time, all the Power/Speed/Thrash/Death/Black Metal subgenres were created by great names such as HELLHAMMER, BATHORY, SODOM, ONSLAUGHT, CELTIC FROST, and in Brazil VULCANO, DORSAL ATLÂNTICA,  TAURUS,  ANTHARES, among many others.

Since then, the world has changed, music has evolved, but the "eighties" or "old school" style became a recurring issue, showing that the most things change, the most they stay the same. Heavy music has no expiration date, from rebellious teens to critical maturity.

Fast and visceral, yet heavy and introspective. But well produced in any case, vintage style; simple yet hard to reproduce. Obscure, existential, pessimistic, niestszchean themes. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Apokalyptic+Raids">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
