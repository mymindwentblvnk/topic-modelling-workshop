Slaters is the moniker of Brooklyn based production duo Al Carlson and Alex Craig. The two arrived at music production via somewhat different paths; Carlson is a jazz musician turned sound engineer/mixer, while Craig toured as a guitarist with several indie-pop and shoegaze acts. A few years into their respective NYC music paths, they found themselves paired together in multiple recording sessions at Carlsonâ€™s Greenpoint studio. Over time they discovered that they shared a mutual taste in not only more experimental-leaning sounds, but also a love for contemporary pop music and a desire to write and produce for others. In the summer of 2016, they joined forces to form Slaters. What started as an idea to make tracks simply for fun took a more serious turn when other artists and writers started to take interest. 
Slaters has worked with on projects with notable artists, such as Roy Blair on his 2019 single "Graffiti" (released as a full-length, 13-track vinyl mixtape in 2020), as well as Claud on their 2019 EP "Sideline Star." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Slaters">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
