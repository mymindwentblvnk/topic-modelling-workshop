Something weird happened in fall 2004, when founding members Henri Heikka and Raine Oikarinen got the idea of doing more unique and left-field material compared to their already existing bands. In late 2004, they introduced the idea to the other guys and got 'em joining the group. The band went into the studio in June, 2005, and their first EP, Lifeless, was released that September. Random Mullet started making the next EP in the early 2006 and composed material for 10 months. In the septempber 2007 Infection was released on the official homepages as well as on the myspace-site.

Infection was praised by media and - more importantly - fans. The band played their first gigs in the summer of 2008 and step by step built a cult-reputation in the northern Finland. Since then the demand has been huge. Gigs contain professional musicianship but also some seriously muddle-headed show. Perfectionism is a burden, right? Being workaholics, Random Mullet decided to prepare the new stuff even more carefully than Infection, and finished a brand-new Remission-EP in the November of 2009.
