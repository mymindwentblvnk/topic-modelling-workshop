The metal/thrash band Warckon was founded at the end of 2007. The band, from Geraardsbergen, Belgium, was founded by Wouter Langhendries. Because of internal problems and lack of motivation Warckon was soon put on hold. More than one year later (summer 2009) there was a new initiative from Marijn Langhendries, Wouter's younger brother. A completely new line-up was formed, which also consisted of Marijn Lostermans and Jonas Bergmans. The music proved to be popular with the crowd and the number of fans and performances steadily grew. Soon it was decided to record a demo in the summer of 2010. What was originally intended to be a demo, grew into an EP and eventually into a full CD. "The Madman's Lullaby" was finally released on April 1st, 2011. In the meantime the band once again tours to strengthen its live reputation and to attract new audiences. Warckon guarantees a hard set and a good interaction with the audience. Definitely worth to check out the CD and listen! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Warckon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
