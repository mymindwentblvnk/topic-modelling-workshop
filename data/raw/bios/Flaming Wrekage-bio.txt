Flaming Wrekage is a heavy metal band formed in Western Sydney. After recently finalizing the line up the boys have begun a run of local shows. All the hard work from the two founding guitarists Adam Tripodi (Lead) and Dave Lupton (Rythym and lead vocals) seems to be paying off with the inclusion of Kristian Steko (Drums) and Jordan Sheriff (Bass).

Each member plays their part well to create an onslaught of shredding lead work, tight riffs, chugging bass and mindblowing drums. Keep updated on Myspace, Lastfm and Facebook to check out new songs from their first EP - Disaster Zone, and gig dates which hope to draw larger crowds each show. See you at the next gig!
