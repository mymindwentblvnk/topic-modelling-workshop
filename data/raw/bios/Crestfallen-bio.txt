Trading in technicality for good ol' fashioned fist-raising tunes, Virginia's Crestfallen played high-energy thrash-influenced metallic punk rock. This is fast & heavy music at it's finest, combining circle-pit-inducing thrashy hardcore with plenty of punk attitude to generate a compelling form of underground music that's aimed at erasing those unnecessary lines between a live band and the crowd. With epic melodic elements and an unmistakable grind influence, it's not hard to see why this youth-filled band has got people pogoing at every show, trying to make punk rock a good time without compromising beliefs.

They released one full length album entitled Streaks Of Terror, one EP which was self titled, and a split with Waifle. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Crestfallen">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
