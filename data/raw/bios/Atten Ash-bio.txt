In 2010 James Greene began working on material for ATTEN ASH which would become ‘The Hourglass’ while playing drums in North Carolina blackmetal band Legion of the Fallen. He sought to create something heavier and more colorful with attention to nuance and emotion. Being a multi-instrumentalist, James was able to record the foundations of the songs, giving a clear picture of the powerful nature of the music. Demos slowly took form. In 2011 James began collaborating with Barre Gambling (founding guitarist of Daylight Dies) and Archie Hunt (vocalist/guitarist of Legion of the Fallen) and the trio continued the musical work: arranging songs, establishing vocal patterns, writing lyrics and guitar solos. 


‘The Hourglass’ was recorded and released online in 2012, to rave reviews from fans around the world. Due to geographic constraints, Atten Ash was not able to play live in support of the album, but they’ve not been idle, new material for a follow up album was being written. In 2014 the band was approached by Hypnotic Dirge Records who agreed to release ‘The Hourglass’ in a physical format for the first time ever. 2015 will see the album’s official physical release which will continue to spread the word about this powerful new entity in the dark melodic metal world.   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Atten+Ash">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
