ANGER AS ART - the embodiment and perhaps savior of American Thrash Metal.  The creation of Thrash Metal pioneer Steve Gaines (of Abattoir, Bloodlust, Tactics, Pagan War Machine, Dreams of Damnation fame).

Admit it. There is a place inside of you where your anger burns deeply and bright.  Somehow, the sound of that anger cannot be transmitted, or at least it couldn't.  Until now.  You have a voice - an avenue for release.  Embrace your anger - convert it to art.  Anger As Art.

Following the release of the Anger As Art CD in September 2004 to rave reviews and open-armed acceptance in the metal community worldwide, demand for the music to be performed live became insatiable.  And now, there is a band.  What else would they be called but ANGER AS ART?  With a pedigree as strong as the music, these musicians can ensure that the future of American Thrash Metal will be... well ...  ANGRY!

2006 will see the release of the band's 2nd full length album, entitled Callous And Furor.  Brandishing the music on these 2 discs as the ultimate metal weapon, Anger As Art are set to establish their brand of Thrash Metal as the standard of the metal world.  If it is the song that is in your heart and soul...  then welcome to Anger As Art.
