4) INHALE from Sweden (ex-Sonic Syndicate vocal), was formed 1998. The music was then a mix between nu-metal
and hard-core with Swedish lyrics. It didn't take long before labels showed
interest for the band, and in 1999 they where signed to a Swedish production
label and the debut-album was recorded(Känn på DET!!!). Although many
labels considered the album promising it was delayed and didn't hit the stores
until spring 2002. This resulted in a poor sale of the album and a departure 
of two members, in other words... INHALE split up.
