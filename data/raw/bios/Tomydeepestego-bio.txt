Tomydeepestego (to be read to my deepest ego) is an instrumental post hardcore band with metal and psychedelic influences, based in Rome (Italy).

Formed in 2006, the band was started by four members, some well known in the italian underground scene by playing in bands such as Inferno Sci-Fi Grind'n'Roll and The Phoenix. Almost immediately, the band attracts the attention of Italian label Subsound Records which releases the band's first album Odyssea, in October 2007. Later that year, the American label KNVBI Records, also released the album as a double vinyl. The band starts playing all around Italy and has the opportunity to be the support band for international bands such as Red Sparrows, Cult of Luna and Fu Manchu. Later the guys start their first European Tour, touching Germany, France and Austria, receiving amazing feedbacks from magazines and webzines worldwide.

In November 2009, the band releases its second album Chronophage, distributed by Subsound Records and Robotic Empire in Europe, United States and Japan. This is a more personal and mature record, which leads the band to a new level of music writing and interpretation. To promote this new album, the band performs numerous concerts, some of which as opening act for God Is An Astronaut, 65daysofstatic, Mono, Russian Circles and Boris. A new European Tour starts, giving the band the opportunity to play its music to a wider audience and gaining, once again, very good feedbacks.

After three years since their last record release, TMDE feels a need to renew and refine its music, so a new member joins the band for the recording of their new album Nero, which will be out in Fall 2012.
