The young singers Althea Forrest (17) and Donna Reid (18) produced a surprise one-off hit with their "Uptown Top Ranking". It was produced by Joe Gibbs based on the instrumental accompanimen of the Alton Ellis' 1967 song "I'm Still in Love", which had already been popularised by Marcia Aitken's cover "I'm Still in Love with You Boy". Their song also used a re-write of the track "Three Piece Suit" by Trinity.

"Uptown Top Ranking" reached number one for a week in the U.K. singles chart in February, 1978 . The surprise was compounded by the act often being billed as Althia & Donna, and the song sometimes given as as "Up Town Top Ranking". The track was written by the duo and Errol Thompson. Althea & Donna became the youngest female duo to have a U.K number one.

They released their album of the same name in 1978, but never met with any more tangible success thereafter. In those days respectable middle-class Jamaican girls did not have anything to do with reggae, so one of them got expelled from her high school. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Althea+&+Donna">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
