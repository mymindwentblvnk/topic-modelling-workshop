Death metal band from Melbourne, Australia bandcamp

Hadal; The hadal zone (named after the Greek god, Hades, god of the Underworld), the delineation for the deepest trenches in the ocean. 

Maw; the symbolic or theoretical centre of a voracious hunger or appetite of any kind.

Comprising past and present members of renowned bands such as Alarum, King Parrot, Swimming with Sharks, A Million Dead Birds Laughing and House of Thumbs, Melbourne Death Metal band Hadal Maw possess a collective experience that surpasses a large contingent of the Australian metal scene. Without having played a live show, Hadal Maw already found themselves getting offers from around the country and since then, they've shared bills with the likes of Aborted, Psycroptic, Ne Obliviscaris, King Parrot, The Amenta, Ulcerate and many more. 

Hadal Maw was born out of a solo recording venture turned full line up, with a focus on creating music that drew upon influences stemming from both old and new school death metal, constructed through an ethos of strong songwriting and forward thinking. Seemingly gathering its own momentum and without even completing a line up, guitarist Nick Rackham, vocalist Aaron Grice and drummer Rob Brens wasted no time in establishing the band by completing a film clip during 2012. Upon completing the line up with guitarist Ben Boyle and bassist Jim Luxford in the same year and with a digital two track promo, the inevitable live shows followed, much to the delight of an already growing fan-base. 

August 24, 2014, will see the release of Hadal Maw's much anticipated debut album "Senium", the product of three years of intensive composing since the birth of the band. 

Senium is now available from
