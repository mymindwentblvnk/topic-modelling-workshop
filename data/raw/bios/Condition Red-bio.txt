There is more than one artist with this name. 

Condition Red is a Progressive Metal band active mostly in the early years of this millennium. They've released two albums starting with an untitled album released 2000, and the album II in 2003.

Ella Grüssner Cromwell-Morgan's delightful vocals fit perfectly with her violin and all the other neo-classical influences in both albums. On the first album there is quite a famous guest contributing, Derek Sherinian, who has played keyboards in Dream Theater, Planet X, Platypus, Alice Cooper and Magna Carta.

The record label is Lion Music, held by Lars Eric Mattsson, who is also a member in the band, playing bass, guitars and additional keys
