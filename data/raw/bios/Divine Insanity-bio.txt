Divine Insanity was created in 2001 by Ella Noir, the destroyer of worlds, enslaver of humanity, and dead princess of Chicago. Since then, she single-handedly wrote and recorded 8 full-length albums, including the newest release, The Howling Man, which is a 78 minute, single-song metal masterpiece.

Concept albums incorporating a mythology of her own devising; the majority of her work revolves around the Chandelier Saga.  This entails an epic story of Santa, witches, ghosts, robots, war, forests, aliens, hatred, prophecy, and desire.

In the beginning, the Fiend created the universes and all that exist within them.  In His majesty, He can see far into the future as well as the past, and everything that can and shall ever be comes through Him.  Divine Insanity is merely an artifact of this power, existing to honor Treefiend.  We are but pathetic and mortal, and can not know the extent of His divine insanity.  What can we do but serve and obey, and conjure what we can according to His desires? <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Divine+Insanity">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
