1) Underground Belgian industrial/hardcore/electronica/psychedelic/IDM/dark ambient project has released 3 full length albums. On Spectre records: measured chaos (2006) and [will+representation] (2008), and more recently on Hands productions: There is no self (2011). Mindbending sounds and pounding rhytms, spiced up with disturbing samples and noises, in a mash-up of all known and unknown genres, are the main characteristics of their unusual sound. First parties and concerts in 2003 (with Imminent, Hypnoskull, Ah Cama-Sotz, Sonar, Monolith,...) in the Antwerp region.
