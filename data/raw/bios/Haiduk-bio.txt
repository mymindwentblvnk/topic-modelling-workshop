Haiduk is a heavy metal solo-project by guitarist, Luka Milojica. The one-man concept was created in early 2009 and came to life with the release of an 8-song demo album, “Plagueswept” (January 2010).

Aggressive and raw, the sound of Haiduk is a direct channeling of haunting musical ideas from composer to listener, as the songwriting, recording and finalizing of the music is a solitary process. Free from outside influence, the songs lure the listener towards themes of primeval nature, solitude, folklore and myth. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Haiduk">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
