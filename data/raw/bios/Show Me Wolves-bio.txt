Show Me Wolves is a solo project which was created in February 2015 by Hörður Lúðvíksson, an Icelandic musician from the North of Iceland but currently located in Reykjavík, the capital of Iceland. Hörður is not unfamiliar to the Icelandic underground music scene but he has been part of bands like Offerings, Provoke and is currently a guitarist for the hardcore/grindcore band Grit Teeth. The band Show Me Wolves does not think much about following a specific music genre but tries to stay within the black/death/progmetal scene, but it´s up to the listeners to decide in which genre they belong. One thing is for sure, Show Me Wolves are here to stay and are on a mission to spread their music worldwide. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Show+Me+Wolves">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
