Shot Injection was formed by Sebastian Westman and Kristian Forsell in early spring 2005. The discussion of how to find solid and skilled members to the band took place at the same time but it lasted for a very long while until Kristian thought of Patrik Moehlenbrock (ex-None) as a second guitarist. Niclas Jonsson (Thagirion) joined the band shortly after and the band started to put together the material Kristian and Sebastian had been working on since the very beginning of the band.

The songwriting process went very smoothly and very soon Shot Injection decided to enter Division One Studios with Tom S Englund of Evergrey as a producer of the demo. Arnold Lindberg of Division One Studios as an engineer of the demo is the perfect choice for a metal band in our position so the choice of studio were never a problem.
