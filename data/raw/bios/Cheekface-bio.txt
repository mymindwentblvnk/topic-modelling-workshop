Cheekface is a rock combo from Los Angeles made up of guitarist and singing person Greg Katz, bassist and other singing person Amanda Tannen, and drummer Mark Edwards. Inspired by the great American talk-singers like Jonathan Richman, Stephen Malkmus and Lou Reed, and British indie rock bands like Wire and The Fall, Cheekface released their first single "Glendale" in 2018. Indie Shuffle lauded the song as "an art-pop gem." The trio's second single "Dry Heat/Nice Town" soon followed, a playfully political song that KCRW called "a treat." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cheekface">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
