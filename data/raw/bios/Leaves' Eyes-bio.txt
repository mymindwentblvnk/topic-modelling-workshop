Leaves’ Eyes is a symphonic metal band with folk metal elements from Ludwigsburg, Germany. Leaves’ Eyes currently consists of Elina Siirala (female vocals), Alexander Krull (male vocals, programming), Thorsten Bauer (guitars/Bass),  Pete Streit (guitars), and Joris Nijenhuis (drums & percussion).

Leaves’ Eyes was formed in 2003 by Liv Kristine with her husband, Alexander Krull, and members of his band, Atrocity. The band combines atmospheric metal and classical elements. The lead female vocals are occasionally backed up by death growls from Alexander Krull.

Their debut album, Lovelorn, was released in 2004. The second album, Vinland Saga, was released 30th of May 2005, and retells the tale of the discovery of Vinland (i.e. North America) by Leif Erikson. The EP Legend Land was released on June 2, 2006 as a followup to Vinland Saga.

Liv Kristine created the band name, which is a homophone for the way “Liv’s Eyes” is pronounced by a Norwegian. “Leaves” is connected to nature, which has always been the biggest inspiration for her. Liv Kristine wrote all of the lyrics for the band's first six albums.

On April 15, 2016, the band announced via Facebook that they were parting ways with Liv Kristine, who would be replaced by Elina Siirala of EnkElination.
