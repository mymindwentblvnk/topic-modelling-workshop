"Tears in shadow" Formed in early winter 2013 with Morgan Rosörn from Östansjö, on guitar and 
Joakim Wickgren from Örebro on Vocals. We soon found a guitarist who became Tobias Ivarsson 
from Kumla and from Åsbro will Håkan Jonasson on drums. Keybord we Tomas Borneland he also 
from Åsbro. And as the bassist in the band, we have tried a lot of that ended up being Viktor Nyberg 
from kumla. Morgan and Joakim come from previous bands Nugatory 90s and Aggregate 2006-2010 
which released "Feel the Pain" 2008. 2012 there was a short project with stoner-metal band with 
Dizl. But in the end we take on Tears in shadow that went into Scar Fricton studio and record our 
demo to be released in summer 2014. Using Emil Gustavsson and Tobias Ljung so we get a nice doom 
album on 4 songs. In the demo, we deliver songs like "My Eyes" about another's suffering gets 
another to suffer. "Alone in hell" Is about to flee from evil and misery. "Burn in water" as it sounds a 
changing world of everything like disasters in the enviroment. Tears in Shadow "is about a man who 
walks alone in the forest where all the horrors lurking who until the last finds happiness beyond the 
forests. More songs are in our setlist is planning to enter the studio to record a new album. We are 
ready to with our doom-music offer you an experience and magic that you will never forget. So keep 
an eye on us from the darkest forests of Sweden so you will experience TEARS IN SHADOW ...
