Doomcave is a one-man Australian Black metal project. While not strictly following the black metal template, Doomcave achieves a brooding, melancholic atmosphere backed with powerful grooves and dashes of epic orchestral and choir pieces. The musical content is deeply personal and translates suffering and joy in painful measures, rising and falling in tune with the current of living. 
Currently the project is proudly produced independently and without the use of a studio. Following the release of the single, 'Dreams', Doomcave released an EP entitled 'Fires Torment' and is about to release its first full length, 'Woebegone'. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Doomcave">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
