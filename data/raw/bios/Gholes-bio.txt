GHOLES was formed in 1995, by Charlotte (vocals) and Fred (guitar). 

After two demotapes, and many line-up changes, GHOLES records their first six tracks CD named "Fleur de Soufre", with Tamatoa (drums), Olivier (guitar) Nicolas (keyboards) and Florian (bass).
It was released in January 2001, on the french label Thundering Records. 
Same year, GHOLES records "The Cube", a SUPURATION cover for the tribute album "A Vision of... SUP".
Then, Charlotte leaves the band.
Between 2001 and 2005, GHOLES works on their next album. A concept album named "Coexistence".
January 2002, Gholes welcomes a new singer, Pierre and records a 2 tracks digital demo.
2004: Olivier and Nicolas leave the band.
March 2005: GHOLES enters ireal studio, and records "Coexistence". One year later, the album is over, waiting for a release date... 
The search for a label is not easy, and GHOLES do not find any support to release their album. 
In July 2010, Pierre, passes away.
Fred, Tamatoa and Florian decide to release "Coexistence" by themself as a tribute to their friend. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gholes">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
