South London-based DJ/producer Lexxi, aka Felix Lee, focuses on acceleration and experimentation in his electronic music as well as in his groundbreaking Endless club nights, which have hosted artists such as Kamixlo, Endgame and Mykki Blanco. ‘The approach is non-linear and non-ironic, with things like dancehall, reggaeton, rap, black metal, noise and plenty of home-brewed productions all moving across one another constantly’, as The Quietus reports about Endless. ‘There’s a sense of freedom that extends beyond the intersection of seemingly disparate genres: no bouncers, no surveillance, BYOB, everyone dancing from the front of the room to the back.’ <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lexxi">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
