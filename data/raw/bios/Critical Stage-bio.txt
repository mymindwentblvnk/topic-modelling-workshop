Critical Stage was a short lived (2004-2007) pissed off hardcore punk band from Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom. They played lots of local gigs around the area and supported the likes of Gang Green and Uk Subs. They released a 4 track demo in late 2005 and a full length album titled 'war is sent by god' in mid 2007 before they split up.
Critical Stage had a wide range of influences from early 80's bands such as Minor threat and SS Decontrol to street punk bands such as The Unseen and the Virus aswell as Ska and pop punk music. Certain members were also into promoting gay pride in hardcore, Lewis the bass player was the key roll of that in this band! sadly passed away after HIV in 2009. RIP.
