Vengeance Incorporated www.vengeanceincorporated.com was an American heavy metal band formed in 1980 in Brandon, Florida by lead guitarist/lead vocalist Guy, along with guitarist Mike. Mike later left the band for a few years.

The band signed to Propaganda Records and released their debut album entitled "Predator" in 1988 which by then consisted of Guy on vocals and bass (keys and occasional guitar in the studio), Curt on lead guitar and Chuck on drums. 

In 1990, the band again recruited former co-lead guitarist Mike to record their next album "Malicious Intent", which topped several European metal radio playlists and sold over 50,000 copies worldwide.

The line-up stayed intact for the next couple of albums and supporting tours, including their biggest selling album, Bad Crazy (1992). Their final release, Love Kills (1994) was an eclectic combination of heavy metal and acoustic pop due to the fact Guy had begun recording a solo album, but the label insisted some of the more commercial tracks be included on the Vengeance Incorporated album, causing some friction.

The demise of metal and live venues in the Tampa Bay area, plus road fatigue and changing musical tastes led to the band calling it quits in 1996. 

The band still maintains an archive site with hundreds of photos, all the albums as well as dozens of other band projects, outtakes, demo versions, live and studio videos and guitar workshops plus band merchandize at www.vengeanceincorporated.com.

Guy, Mike and Chuck re-formed with Guy on acoustic/electric guitar and another bassist as Screamin' Weasel, later docweasel, or docweaselband, releasing the album Loden Bathmat (2002) and Baby Giraffes (2006).
