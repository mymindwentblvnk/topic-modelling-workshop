Founded in the year 2004 by Ilkka Koivisto and Ville Oravala, Asa-Noir was originally a heathen black metal duo contemplating the many aspects of Asatru. However, after seemingly neverending troubles and changes in the band's line up, the present-day sextet finally came to exist when Henri Asikainen, guitarist of Dirge Eternal, took on the task of being Asa-Noir's vocalist in 2010. More potent than ever before, Asa-Noir now compounds elements from different styles of metal, industrial and othet intriguing genres with a more twisted, devious vision of Asatru embroided by features of the works of E.A. Poe and H.P. Lovecraft, thus creating a unique and dark yet flowing combination.

Their debut EP entitled "Reforming Heathen Origins" - a manifestation of their existence - is released in the summer 2011. This is the Journey into the darkened depths and depraved, nightly nooks of Loke that are Asa-Noir. And the Journey has but begun..
