straight edge, hardcore and female fronted band formed in Glasgow, Scotland (UK) in 2001, after several minor lineup changes their first demo was self released. Limited to 300 copies this sold out fast! More lineup changes followed as well as extensive touring of the UK. The now settled lineup released a split CD (What lies ahead) with Peterborough band Eviscerate AD. The release of this CD on "Unity Worldwide Recordings" saw the band hit mainland Europe for the first time. The band was asked by "Rucktion Records" to record a new CD. Blood Cleanse the Streets was the result. This CD, accompanied by wider European distribution saw Broken Oath reaching out to many new fans. A European tour with Bristol band Burning Skies followed. Appearances at both Filled With Hate Fest 2006 and BFLBU fest 2006 capped a successful period in the band's history. Unfortunately BROKEN OATH split up in 2008.
