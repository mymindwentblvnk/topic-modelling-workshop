Karg (German for "barren") is an Austrian Post-Black Metal band. It is the solo project of Michael V. Wahntraum who also is the lead vocalist for Harakiri for the Sky. In it's earlier years, Karg mostly produced Ambient Black Metal. Wahntraum mentioned artists such as Lifelover, Forgotten Woods, This Will Destroy You and Explosions in the Sky as major influences. Releasing seven full-length albums as of 2020, the seventh album Traktat made it onto the German charts for the first time at position 34.

Karg's music features typical Black Metal elements, as well as some Post Hardcore influences and Wahntraum's stylistic screamed vocals. The lyrics, which mainly deal with personal and biographical topics, are written in High German and, from the album Weltenasche onwards, also in Middle Bavarian (Pongau dialect). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Karg">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
