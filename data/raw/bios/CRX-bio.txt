CRX is a band from Los Angeles, California comprised of Nick Valensi (Vocals/Guitar), Ralph Alexander (Drums), Brad Oberhofer (Keyboard/Backing Vocals), Jon Safley (Bass/Backing Vocals), and Darian Zahedi (Guitar/Backing Vocals). Original keyboardist Richie Follin left in 2018. 

The band formed in 2013 and released their debut album 'New Skin' on October 28th, 2016. The album was mostly written by just Valensi and served as his first solo effort upon branching out from The Strokes. The album spawned two singles, 'Ways To Fake It' and 'Broken Bones'. 

During extensive touring for 'New Skin', Valensi encouraged greater collaboration by inviting in Zahedi and Safley to help him write tracks based on the music they were listening to while traveling. In 2018, their single 'Love Me Again' was released; this single would would mark an introduction of a New Wave inspired sound into the band's music. 

Pulling from more New Wave influences like Love Me Again, their sophomore album 'PEEK' was released on August 23rd, 2019 and spawned three singles: 'We're All Alone', 'Falling', and 'Get Close'. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/CRX">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
