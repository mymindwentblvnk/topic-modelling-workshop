The Sadies is a Canadian rock and roll / country and western band formed in 1998 in Toronto, Ontario. The band consists of Dallas Good, Travis Good, Sean Dean and Mike Belitsky. 

Led by brothers Dallas and Travis Good, the band honed a distinctive sound, taking influence from traditional country, surf music, and garage rock. After earning notice and adding backing singer Neko Case, the group issued their debut LP, Precious Moments, in 1998. Tremendous Efforts followed in early 2001, teaming them with Breeders/PJ Harvey producer Steve Albini for the second time. A year later, Stories Often Told marked their first album without Albini, placing Blue Rodeo's Greg Keelor in his position. The Sadies produced themselves on 2004's Favourite Colours, with Keelor, Nick Luca, and Chris Shreenan-Dyck handling the engineering duties; Robyn Hitchcock made a guest appearance as vocalist and lyricist on one track. The Sadies have also recorded albums in collaboration with R&B legend Andre Williams and Mekons frontman Jon Langford. The Sadies released a live album, In Concert, Vol. 1, in 2006. They also collaborated on the album Going Out With Heavy Trash w/ Jon Spencer. 

Amongst later releases are Internal Sounds, released on September 17, 2013 through Outside Music; And the Conquering Sun, their 2014 collaboration with Gord Downie on Arts & Crafts Productions; and Northern Passages, released in February 2017 on Yep Roc Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Sadies">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
