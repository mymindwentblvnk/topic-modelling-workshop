There are multiple artists with this name (not to be confused with Post-Mortem and Postmortem):

1) Post Mortem was a thrash metal band formed in 1982, in Boston, Massachusetts. They merged some fast thrash metal parts with slowly doom fragments and near-death metal vocals. The definitive line-up was finally settled on in early 1985. This consisted of: John McCarthy (vocals), John Alexander (guitar), Mark Kelley (bass) and Rick McIver (drums).  Their first album, "Coroner's Office" was released in 1986 on New Renaissance records, followed in 1987 by the ep, "The Missing Link" on the same label. In 1989 "Festival of Fun" was recorded, but was deemed as too inaccessible by the label it was later bootlegged by several labels.

2) Post Mortem was an anarchist punk band from England, UK.

3) An RAC band from Spain.

Nota bene, if you are here for the field recording done for the Nekrophile Rekords compilation "The Beast 666", please change your tags: the track was included on the cassette without artist name, and the correct title is "Post Mortem: The Sea of Cefalu", this is clearly indicated by the typesetting - artist names were printed in bold, titles in regular letters. It consisted of sound of the Tyrrhenian Sea at Cefalu, recorded in 1983 by Kadmon (Gerhard Petak of Allerseelen) upon a concept and request of the label owner Michael DeWitt (of Korpses Katatonik / Zero Kama). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Post+Mortem">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
