The Vile Impurity are a tech-death metal band from Springfield, Illinois. Miles Ellegoods outstanding guitar playing and Pete Rocks thunderous drumming set out a new level of intensity in Summer of 2010. They recruited Dustin Ogle for his brutal vocal offering, bringing the voice that brought the sound together. Aaron Kaufmanns tremendous bass playing was the only missing piece ...the band needed to finish the line-up. Immediately, results began to flourish and the band quickly found themselves in the studio recording their first e.p. titled, "Sanctity In Ruin." After releasing the e.p. under the name, After the Burning, they quickly began building popularity in the surrounding music scene. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Vile+Impurity">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
