Lacryma Sanguine is a death/doom metal band from Fortaleza, Brazil formed in 2005 but had their ideas taken root already in 2003.

The band begun in 2005 when André Barroso decided to start a doom metal band and called a group of friends who share the same musical tastes.

At the begining the band consisted in 6 members, one of them as keyboardist,  but nowadays the band decided to keep the current line-up with only 5 members because they never found someone who really brought interesting ideas and arrangements to their sound.
The current line-up is Max Santiago (vocals), André Barroso (guitars, vocals and also piano and synths), Yuri Nobre (guitars, vocals), Allan Daniel (bass) and Gabriel de Sousa (drums).

The band is often compared to other doom metal bands like Saturnus, My Dying Bride and Swallow The Sun besides the band always try to explore all their influences through many sounds and ideas in the doom metal scene. 

In 2008 the band released their first material As The Autumn Ends and at the moment the band is on studio recording the first full-lenght album which will be called "Amongst These Walls".
