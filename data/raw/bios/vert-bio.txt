There are several projects working under the title 'Vert':

1. Vert, a Adam Butler act on Sonig records, who has released 4 albums since 2000.  From the first album - "The Koln Konzert", a radical and acclaimed deconstruction of Keith Jarrett's jazz classic, through "Nine Types of Ambiguity" and "Small Pieces Loosely Joined" which explored the intersections of electronica, free jazz, chamber music and pop, to the recent "Some Beans and an Octopus", where he reinvented himself as a hiphop ragtime vaudeville storyteller.

2. Vert, who released one track of smooth jazzy triphop in 1996 which appeared on several compilations.

3. Vert, an English heavy metal band. 

Described by Rock Midgets as "an outstanding head-banging monster", the band’s debut album ’Accepting Denial’ was released in early 2007 amid a shower of publicity and critical acclaim both in the UK and abroad. Following this, the band focussed their efforts on touring, and from Aberdeen to Aberystwyth, Camden Underworld to Glasgow Cathouse and everywhere in between, Vert built on their reputation, forged on a tireless hard work ethic.

While Kerrang! magazine lauded them as a band that "...will have you bouncing off the walls - as scary as cancer!", Vert undertook two headlining UK tours alongside a number of profile supports in the West Midlands with the likes of Skindred, InME and New York’s Dub Trio.

Tracks appeared on covermount discs, nestled alongside Soilwork, Down and As I Lay Dying, and in November the band went out on a further UK run, this time as tour support for US multi-million selling Boy Hits Car.

Following line-up changes and the myspace-release of new demo 'From Beyond The Shadows', the group disbanded in early 2009 after 7 years on the UK circuit. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vert">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
