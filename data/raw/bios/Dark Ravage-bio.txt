The time will come, when everything will be covered in darkness. The blackness, vanity and chaos will dominate. Dark Ravage - it's just an entity, suffering from the absurd universe. It is the deeper form of idea and emotion. It is the condition, rising from the outerest depths of our souls. It's a desire to destroy and dissapear. It is the truth that we declare.
