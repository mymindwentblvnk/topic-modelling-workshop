The group started to form in the summer of 2007 when Marko Strnad and Jure Vandur decided to create a melodic death metal band named To Hate. They were looking for a bass player and they thought of Oliver Čepek who had sometimes played with them for fun. At the time Oliver was a member of an atmospheric death metal band called Mor Zaboth. The band also needed a drummer, so they invited Sašo Corso, another Mor Zaboth member. After long debates and exchanging ideas about music, Oliver and Sašo left their first band and joined To Hate. To Hate needed only a couple of months to put together four songs and record them in Studio Ultra for their MySpace site. The recording was followed by four concerts in Maribor and Ljubljana. Further concerts had to be cancelled due to Marko's illness. The group started to think about writing new songs because they were fed up with playing covers and wanted to show their true colours. In October 2008 the songs were finished and the guys entered the studio. The drums were recorded at 5th Season Studio, other instruments and vocals at Soundesign Studio. Mastering and mix was made by Matic Mlakar. The album with the name Different Faces came to life in spring 2009. Different Faces includes 12 songs. Beginning to Hate, Break a Spell, Key To The Suicide Area, Programme Zero, Step Of Truth (which is one of the songs from the demo), Silence Implies Consent, Panic Disorder, Zirberck 1329, Useless Device, Black Hole Of Miracles, Burn Down With My Existence and Micron. The album's cover, the booklet and the logo were designed by Sanja Pocrnjić. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/To+Hate">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
