Chairlift was an electro-pop band formed in 2005 in Boulder, Colorado, United States. The band consisted of Caroline Polachek (vocals, keyboards) and Patrick Wimberly (bass, drums). The third founding member, Aaron Pfenning (guitar, synths, vocals), left the band in 2010.  In December 2016,  Chairlift announced that they would be breaking up, with a final tour in the spring of 2017 .

The band formed in Boulder, Colorado in early 2006 to make live music for haunted houses. Frequenting the Broker Inn on the edge of town for empty late-night jazz shows, Polachek, Pfenning and Wimberly were mystified by the 1980's faux-gothic architecture, oak-cabinet aquariums, vacant dancefloors, fake trees, crystal chandeliers and dark velveteen booths. Relocating to Brooklyn in the summer of 2006, the trio continued on to develop a hypnotic yet tongue-in-cheek style, playing shows around Brooklyn and the Lower East Side.

'Evident Utensil', released on 7" vinyl featuring a remix by MGMT, marked Chairlift's first release on Kanine. Chairlift unleashed their first full-length album, "Does You Inspire You", on Kanine Records on September 30th, 2008. The duo completed their sophomore album, "Something" in 2011 for release in January 2012. Recorded between New York and London, they recruited producers Alan Moulder (Depeche Mode, My Bloody Valentine, Nine Inch Nails) and Dan Carey (MIA, Franz Ferdinand, Lily Allen) and Carey also mixed the majority of the record. Three singles, 'Amanaemonesia', 'Sidewalk Safari' and 'Met Before' preceded the album's release. "Moth", the third and final album was released January 22, 2016, preceded by the single 'Ch-Ching'.
