A symphonic black metal band from Luxembourg, Vindsval formed in 1996 and changed their name to Le Grand Guignol after releasing one album, Imperium Grotesque, in 1999. The band was known as Vindsval up until 2006, previously having been known as Dregoth.
The name Vindsval originates from northern mythology where winter's father bears the name "Vindsval" - The Wind-Cold. 
They also released a demo entitled "Of Heathen Blood and Soil" in 1997. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vindsval">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
