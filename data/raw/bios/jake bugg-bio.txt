Jake Edwin Charles Kennedy, known professionally as Jake Bugg, is an English singer-songwriter.

He was born in Nottingham to musical parents who separated when he was young. His father, David Bugg, was a nurse and his mother worked in sales, both parents having previously made recordings. He grew up in the Clifton council estate of Nottingham and started playing guitar at the age of 12 after being introduced to the instrument by his uncle Mark. He attended Farnborough School Technology College in Clifton. He has described a formative musical moment when, aged 12, he heard Don McLean's "Vincent (Starry, Starry Night)" on an episode of The Simpsons. He was enrolled in a music technology course but, by the age of 16, he had dropped out and was writing and performing his own songs. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jake+Bugg">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
