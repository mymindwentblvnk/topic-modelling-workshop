Featuring Samual Loynes (of Voices/Akercocke) and Matt Adnett (Obscene Entity), Shrines is a long-awaited new UK-based collaboration set to deliver a powerful, pioneering and eclectic sound to 2015. Born from a raw beginning and raised to reach a panoramic scale of sound, Shrines adheres to a powerful and cinematic approach to music whilst delivering a form of the black and death-inspired sounds from which it has risen. With songs that capture a wide array of narrative and emotion, from love and violence, to David Lynchâ€™s exploration of evil in Twin Peaks, Shrines is a unique and unconfined exploration of nature. By using story-telling to deliver a snapshot of both human vice and endeavour, there is no stone left unturned. A sound set to lead the listener on a journey like no other. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Shrines">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
