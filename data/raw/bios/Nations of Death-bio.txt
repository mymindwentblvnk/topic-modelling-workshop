Death Metal band from Denmark that formed back in 1990. They released only 2 demos, “No One Is Divine” and “Wrecked”, before splitting up. Some of the members later went on to join bands like Iniquity. One thing’s for sure: the instrumentation is awesome. It sounds like a mix of early Morbid Angel with some thrash metal elements thrown in for good measure. About lyrical themes: social issues, politics, anti-war, animal liberation, etc.
