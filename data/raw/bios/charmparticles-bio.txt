Charmparticles recently came across a disappointing notion: they were completely uninspired by the long-established musical tradition of ‹write album. record album. release album. wait for three years and more resources. repeat›. It became collectively understood that in this digital age, they should be free to try alternate ways of creating music, recording music, and—most importantly—releasing music.

The band sought to restructure (or completely destroy, in some cases) their process; to challenge band members’ individual and collective skills; and to pique the interest of fans, colleagues, and any passers-by. Several ideas were considered. One idea has become The Year We Make Contact.

Charmparticles are writing/producing/recording/releasing a single track for every month of 2010. Each song will be posted on the band's website for free or paid download (your choice, pal!), and will be streaming at Last.fm. At the conclusion of the year, the 12 songs will form the collection: The Year We Make Contact.

Is it an album? Not in the traditional sense, though perhaps it's the album of the future—where the artist takes the listener on an extended meander through the long, twisty creative process. The hope is that at year's end, the 12 songs will mesh to form something that is more than the sum of it's parts—a complete and ambitious collection that evokes wandering ghosts and regret tempered by rebirth. For Charmparticles, this IS a rebirth, and the resulting changes in perspective and process have the potential to continue to influence their musical approach for some time after this collection is wrapped up…
