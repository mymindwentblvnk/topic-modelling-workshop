Having explored the atmosphere of the metal scene in Delhi and various parts of India through countless gigs in years 2010 – 2011, band members and close friends Kartikeya Sinha (Bass), Ruben Franklin (Guitars), and Sagar Siddhanti (Drums) mutually aspired to create metal music with its proper incult essence. The foundation was still incomplete. Upon meeting Arpit Pradhan (Guitars), and Supratim Sen (Vocals) did the wholeness finally settle in. Fragarak, a New Delhi based death metal outfit themed upon the society and the lies it portrays as undeniable truth, came into being.

The band draws revelation from “Fragarach”, an aboriginal sword of the Celtic mythology, accorded with the potential to dismantle the most resistive of all shielded protections.The unquestioned system that we are a part of, forges a deceptive shield. To question the authority that steps on us, to retaliate against the lies we are forced to live with, to cultivate a much needed shamble – is what Fragarak’s music represents.

Fragarak is a lethal blend of melodic tunes accompanied by intense technical rhythms, supported by fiercely independent bass lines, bolstered with decimating drumming, and channelled by lyrical themes delivered through bestial vocals.
