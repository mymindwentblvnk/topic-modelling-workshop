Urlo Nero is a black metal musical project born of Asmodeus (Vocals / Guitars / Bass) in early 2011, the project gets underway with the arrival of the role of drummer in the first demo that will work as a bassist. The duo offers oldschool black metal with sounds quite raw from what can be deduced from the first published recordings.
In March 2012 the band entered the studio at the Orange Studios to record their first demo entitled "Have Faith" distributed by Amem Productions.
Currently the band is working on the future output of the second demo. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Urlo+Nero">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
