There are apparently at least two bands by the name of Circle of SIlence.

1) One is a dutch apocalyptic, melancholic and melodic metal band born in the late 90's as a solo project of Sascha Teschner, but active since 1 january 2005 as a 5-piece band. Circle of Silence released several EP's: "The love of my life", "I'm out of my mind: OUT OF MY MIND!!!" and "2.0". 

September 2013 KEEP ORDER! was released. 

Circle of Silence is:

Sascha Teschner (drums)
Brian van der Naald (guitar)
Patrick van den Heuvel (bass)
Arnout Lie (guitar, vocals)
Thomas Koudijs (vocals)





2)The other one is an underground Power/Speed metal band from Heilbronn, Germany. Founded in early 2005 as a two-man project of Guitarist Tobias Pfahl and Bassplayer Bj√∂rn Boehm, they were joined by singer Nick, second guitarist Chris and drummer Pit by the time of March 2006.

Their style can be described as a mixture of Power and Speed or even Thrash Metal. The heavier approach is visible for example by the rather harsh style of singing Nick uses.

In 2006, they published their first album, titled Your Own Story. ON this CD, even some Death Metal-influences are visible. This album is almost sold out in the meantime.

Even though they still are signed to no Label, they published a second album in 2008, titled The Supremacy of Time. On this album, they showed a further developed sound, without Death Metal-influences, concentrating more on the Power metal-influenced Guitar- and Basswork and a slightly thrashier approach on drums and vocals.

In the secind half of 2010, they returned to the studio to record their third album The Blackened Halo, which is supposed to be released in spring 2011.
In January 2011 they signed a worldwide record deal with Massacre Records, where the album will be released. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Circle+of+Silence">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
