Here comes The WAEVE: as 2020 was limping its way to the finish line, two acquaintances met and exchanged missives over that strange Christmas.  Graham Coxon - iconic songwriter, guitarist and vocalist in  Blur, plus the originator of acclaimed soundtracks including ‘The End of the F**king World’ - and  Rose Elinor Dougall - revered solo artist, Mark Ronson collaborator and founder of  The Pipettes - embarked on some tentative explorations into songwriting. Before long, these gave rise to an unexpected sonic universe. Initially drawing on a shared love of English folk music, storytelling and the associated landscapes of this beleaguered island, the collaborators grew in confidence to start voyaging into uncharted waters. The sound developed slowly but surely, voices and words started to find their natural space, guitars and saxophones made clarion calls, strings lifted into other stratospheres. 

Music was made with a cinematic breadth whilst maintaining an honest intimacy, to make the internal external. The WAEVE is the coming together of two musicians on the verge, themes of oblivion and surrender are juxtaposed with suggestions of hopefulness and light. Against a brutal global backdrop of impending apocalypse and despair, Coxon and Dougall strove to free themselves through the defiant, blind optimism of making music. 

By working together the pair have formed a new, singular sonic identity. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+WAEVE">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
