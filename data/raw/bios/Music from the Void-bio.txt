MUSIC FROM THE VOID started in 2012 as a one man project of Myrkwood which turned into the joined project of Gorm (drums and mixing of the recordings), Masae (lyrics and vocals), Herr Logi (bass) and Myrkwood (songwriting and guitar) in 2014/2015. The music is a combination of black and doom metal inspired riffs and is inspired by depression, the dark side of human nature, dark paganism and witchcraft.
