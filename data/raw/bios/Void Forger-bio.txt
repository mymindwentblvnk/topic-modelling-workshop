Void Forger is a Romanian band from Bucharest playing a mix of sludge, crust, death and black metal formed in 2010. 

Its three original members were Anca, Bogdan and Volodea. The first few jams from 2010 lead to the ideas approached by the current band, old school down tempo harshly distorted music with hints of speed, screamed vocals and with a dark and nihilistic sound. The lyrics are inspired by dystopian themes and social issues.

In early April 2012 they released a 3-song demo, Ruined, which is free to download.

In late 2012, Anca left the band and Aurash joined as the new bass guitarist.

In the spring of 2013, alongside Human Host Body from Slovenia, Void Forger went on an European tour, playing in squats throughout Slovenia, Germany, Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland and Italy.

In mid 2014, a cover of Jerry’s Kids’ Raise The Curtain has been featured in Toxicbreed’s Funhouse cover compilation Casa de Diversion Covers Vol. 3. https://casadediversion.bandcamp.com/album/covers-vol-3

Late summer of 2014, Dávid joined the band as the new drummer. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Void+Forger">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
