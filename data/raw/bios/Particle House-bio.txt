Particle House is a virtual smorgasbord of musical influences and features an eclectic mix of indie, disco and synth pop. The man behind the moniker is Swedish producer Sebastian Forslund. His body of work ranges from Future Bass to Glitter Punk and is a testament to his versatility as a musician and producer as much as his unconditional love for music. With a playful approach Forslund goes all in, serving an array of pop bangers you didn’t know you were missing. It’s fun, it’s groovy, it’s sexy, and it’s not so important what genre you pin it to as long as you enjoy it. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Particle+House">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
