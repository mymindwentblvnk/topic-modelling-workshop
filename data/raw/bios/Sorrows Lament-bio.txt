Sorrows Lament is a doom/goth-metal band based in Eskilstuna, Sweden.


It all started out in fall 2001 but unfortunately the band disbanded shortly thereafter. The next fall the band started up again, but as time went by several members passed. As a consequense of that the music making progressed very slowly. It wasnÂ´t until summer 2003 that things started to move forward and Sorrows Lament found a steady line-up. Although still short of a bassplayer we recorded our debute demo called "...when I'm gone" during the Autumn of 2004. After several gigs and another recording containing 2 new songs we've decided to take a break from Sorrows Lament for a while due to lack of time. But hopefully we will get together and start the writing of a brand new chapter in the Sorrows Lament saga... <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sorrows+Lament">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
