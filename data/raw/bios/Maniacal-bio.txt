Maniacal are a Metalcore/Thrash Metal band from stoke-on-trent.

Formed in late 2006 Maniacal began with an intense writing process to form the basis for a sound body of music on which they could build upon. After hauling equipment around for months they finally managed to get a permanent practice place in a studio with other local metal bands. By reworking and scrapping a lot of material they began building a set of songs ready for the stage and the recording studio to finally get the ball rolling. Their first ever gig in August 2007 went down with huge success suprising many people and helped secure them a name in the area. After only 3 gigs they found themselves headlining at The Underground and with more dates been offered to them for the near future Maniacal are sure to set a name within the area as one of the big bands along with Burnt and Fleshold.
