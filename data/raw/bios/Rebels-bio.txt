There have been various groups that have recorded as Rebels.

1. Rebels was a Czech psychedelic pop/rock group that was formed in summer 1967 by Jiří Korn and Svatopluk Čech, disbanded in 1970. The final lineup Jiří Korn (bass guitar, vocals), Zdeněk Juračka (guitar) and Karel Jahn (drums) reunited in the late 1990s, occasionally performing until 2006. 

2. Although The Rebels weren't around long, they were not short on talent.  The group consisted of John Mathews (bariton), "Big" Jim Hamill (later went on to fame with the Kingsmen), Horace Parrish (tenor), and London Parris (bass).  Other members included Jay Berry and Jimmy Taylor. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rebels">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
