Motivated and characterized by an uncritical devotion to the most extreme sounds. A wild-eyed, unbalanced and obsessive familiarity with noisy post-hardcore and melancholic mammoth soundscapes impregnated with the saddest melodies. Thus the backbone of their music is to be found in major out-standing noise hardcore bands such as Botch, Shora, Shovel, Cult of Luna, Neurosis and Breach, thus incorporating further elements of punk, hardcore and rock nâ€™ roll, so that they could stick firmly to the post-hardcore scene. With sensitive hands and shyness, they can achieve to move on their music to post-rock edges. Time to Burn brings their own menace to their songs, partly parting ways with math structures to incorporate crushing waves of metallic heavyness which can foresee a bright future on this ground. And if so Time to Burn would provoke an immense crush on their music with an overwhelming doom sludge. The band formed in Paris, France in 2002.
