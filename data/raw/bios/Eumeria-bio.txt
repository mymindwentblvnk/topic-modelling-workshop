Eumeria is an international progressive metal band that was formed in 2009. It is the brainchild of keyboardist Bobby Williamson who wanted to create a brand of music that was unique and exciting after leaving renowned progressive metal band ‘Outworld’ earlier in the year. Eumeria was initially conceived as a musical project but has since matured into a fully fledged band.

Lineup: Jonny Tatum - Vocals, Bobby Williamson - Keyboards, Reece Fullwood - Guitars, Kevin Bartlett - Drums, Shawn Kascak - Bass Guitars. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Eumeria">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
