New York’s electro-rock outfit Heloise & The Savoir Faire released “Trash, Rats and Microphones” on April 26, 2008 via Simian Records (Elijah Wood’s new label and joint-venture with Yep Roc Records). With a live show described by Disorder Magazine as a “great big flying disco ball swerving through a relentless shower of pink glitter and synth-lasers,” Heloise & The Savoir Faire have gained popularity in the UK after making their TV debut on The Graham Norton Show and Channel 4's Friday Night Project. An electrified collision of late-70’s disco-infused dance punk and 80’s synth-pop, the group is fronted by the charismatic Heloise Williams and backed by two dancers (Joe Shepard and Sara Sweet Rabidoux) and a full band (James Bellizia on guitar, Luke Hughett on drums and Jason Diamond on bass). Produced with and engineered by Andrew Schneider at Translator Audio in Brooklyn, “Trash, Rats and Microphones” captures the energy, sexuality and humor of the live show. The album also features guest vocals by Debbie Harry who recently called Heloise & The Savoir Faire one of her favorite underground bands in The New York Times Style Magazine. Debbie is featured on the songs "Downtown" and "Canadian Changs". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Heloise+&+The+Savoir+Faire">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
