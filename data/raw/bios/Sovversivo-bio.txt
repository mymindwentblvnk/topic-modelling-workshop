The Band comes from Italy and born in 1998, but only from 2000 sets up its own identity starting to write songs mixing Hard Rock and Heavy Metal style. 
A great live activity from '02 to '06 in collaboration with Black Dahlia Agency give Sovversivo the opportunity to play supporting important bands like Labyrinth, Rain, Extrema, Doomsword, Omen and Virgin Steele.
