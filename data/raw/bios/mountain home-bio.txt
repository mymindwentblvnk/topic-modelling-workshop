Mountain Home is the folk group of Marissa Nadler, Greg Weeks, Maragret Wienk (of Fern Knight), Ilya Monosov, Joshua Emery Blatchley and Kristen Sherer.
The music is slow and haunting, with brooding melancholy somewhat in the vein of Marissa and Greg's solo work.
They have released one self-titled album in 2007, on the Language of Stone label. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mountain+Home">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
