Wild Throne consists of Josh Holland (guitar/vocals), Noah Burns (drums) and Jeff Johnson (bass). The band’s sound is a dynamic mix of elements of Judas Priest, Mastodon, Queen, the Mars Volta, classic metal, thrash and progressive rock, creating music that Pitchfork once described as “exhilarating, fun [and] ferocious” and “proof that ambition and skill don’t automatically cancel out heart.”    <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/WILD+THRONE">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
