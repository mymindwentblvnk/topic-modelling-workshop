Planet Gemini have been making music since 2002. They have managed to release two full albums a year since the start of the bands recording process. One thing that makes this "underground" band unique is that they offer all of their CDs for download (all 6 of them). A classic blend of Black Sabbath/Deep Purple/Candlemass/Trouble while keeping a new and innovative approach to Classic Doom Metal.

The Cauldron of Fuzz series is a labor of improvisation from the band. According the band they lock themselves in the studio for a full weekend without sleep and just improvise ideas. The Cauldron of Fuzz series has been released on Halloween of the last three years and is schedualed to be released on Halloween of 2005 under their "Trinity" CD Boxed Set.

As they've said in the past
"We are the FUCKING underground"
