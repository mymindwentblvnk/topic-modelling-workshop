Rebaelliun was a Brazilian Death Metal band from Porto Alegre that was founded in 1998 by vocalist / bassist Marcello Marzari, guitarists Fabiano Penna and Ronaldo Lima, and drummer Sandro Moreira. After the release of their demo Promo Tape '98, the band was signed by the Dutch label Hammerheart Records, who released their debut album "Burn the Promised Land" in 1999. The release was followed by a European tour. The band recorded an EP for "Bringer of War", featuring a Morbid Angel cover. Shortly thereafter a second album entitled "Annihilation" was released, which was followed by a second European tour. Various internal problems eventually caused the band to split up in 2002. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rebaelliun">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
