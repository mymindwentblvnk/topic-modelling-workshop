We are Dissect the Coroner, hailing from Nashville, Tennessee since the beginning of 2006. We have spent the past few years developing both our music, and ourselves as a group. We're playing shows for fans across the U.S., so if you like our music, book us a date, stay updated with our calendar, or shout at us to put your city on our map. We recorded and released ''The Red Handed Victim'' EP in early 2007, and a 2-Track Demo in 2008, and are now preparing a Full-Length album to be distributed world-wide. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dissect+the+Coroner">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
