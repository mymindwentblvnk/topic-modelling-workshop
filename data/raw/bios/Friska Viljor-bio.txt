Those of you that have heard of Friska Viljor before probably know the story of how Daniel Johansson and Joakim Sveningsson started the band after both their relationships had gone down the drain. Those of you who haven't heard of the band still know this particular kind of story far too well. Heartache has always been one of the prime catalysts for artistic work, and every artist sees their own suffering as something unique, and their thoughts and work about it as something the whole world should share, says Daniel. 

After four years using music as a cheap therapist both Daniel and Joakim had come to the point in their lives when it is time for a fresh start. This clearly shows on the band's third album ”For New Beginnings.” 

The lyrics no longer consists solely of broken hearts. Instead there's stories of happiness, sorrow and hope. You'll get some soul searching in "If I Die Now," a bit of nostalgia in the childhood portray "Manwhore", and some apathy in "Hibiskus Park". 

There's also some changes in the music. You still get the drastic leaps between genres and the bands typical instrumentation with everything from mandolin, ukulele and glockenspiel to accordion, clarinet and saw. But you can clearly sense a new direction, away from euphoric choruses towards depth and seriousness.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Friska+Viljor">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
