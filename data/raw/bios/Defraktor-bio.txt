Defraktor is a experimental art project, blending various sounds and styles, from Experimental Electro Wave to ambient and field recordings, started by Karsten Hamre (also known from Penitent, Arcane Art, Dense Vision Shrine etc) in 2002.

There are no limits of what elements that might be blended into the music of Defraktor. For Karsten Hamre it is the channel of exploring many grounds of music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Defraktor">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
