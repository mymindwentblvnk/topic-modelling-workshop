Fyfe is the stage name of Paul Dixon, a 23-year-old graduate of Manchester University, now based in London. Previously known under the name 'David's Lyre', he was dropped by his record label in spite of critical acclaim. After one self-released album, 'Picture of Our Youth', he's changed name and style and is now producing what's been termed 'folk electronica', which has generated a lot of hype online. His debut EP, Solace, was released in April 2013. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fyfe">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
