King Dude is a side project of American musician TJ Cowgill (Teen Cthulhu and Book of Black Earth) of Seattle, WA that explores a darkly spiritual acoustic-folk sound.

Pulling together the biblical sound and isolation of the bygone days of revelation with an atmosphere filled with hope and salvation, King Dude has woven his own brand of American music.  He brandishes many varied influences in his songwriting. Everything from British Folk, Americana, Country and Blues can be heard in his songs. Even the heavier sounds of Heavy Metal tend to sneak and slither it's way into the King Dude canon. The resulting songs are much more of a modern day hymn then average pop song. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/King+Dude">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
