Whorecore is an Israeli deathgrind band and was formed in early 2003 by Tomer Jones (vocals), Assaf Meidan (drums) and Nir Doliner (guitar) who called in Yaron Shacham (original bass player) Eran Segal (guitar) and Ariel Ron (vocals) to complete the initial line up.

The correct band's mamber is:

Vocals - Zion Mizrahi , Ariel Ron
Guitars - Nir Doliner 
Drums - Assaf Meidan
Bass - Evil Haim

Several weeks after the bands' ignition they started pursuing their goal to play as much shows as possible with total disregard to the type of venue or their own personal safety on stage.

After intense months of playing (and injuries) the band gathered audiences ranging from metal to the punk and hardcore scenes, and through that process earned their name as one of Israel's best live acts. In late 2003 Haim Binaymini came in to replace Yaron Shacham on the bass and complete the bands line up. 
In 2006 Sven de Caluwé (Aborted, Leng T'che) replaced Ariel Ron as second vocalist.

Whorecore changed their name to They:Swarm and released a new EP titled The Mundane Corruption in early 2008. 
The EP marked some changes in the musical style, adding more brutal death metal influences.
Later Sven de Caluwé departed from the band along with guitarist Eran Segal.
After that the band changed their name to Whorecore again.

The band are currently writing a new album.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Whorecore">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
