Tyondai Braxton is an American composer and performer and ex-guitarist / singer of American experimental-rock super-group Battles, and as a prominently featured artist on record label Warp Records. He has been actively producing and performing music under his name as a solo artist, as well as collaboratively under various group titles and collectives, since 1998.

Raised in Connecticut, Braxton is the son of multi-instrumentalist and avant-garde composer Anthony Braxton. He later studied composition at Hartt School of Music in Hartford, Connecticut with Robert Carl and Ingram Marshall. His “orchestrated loops” involve real-time overlaying of guitar, voice and found objects, designed to simulate an ensemble.

“Central Market,” released on Warp Records is seen a new direction in Braxton’s orchestral style, while maintaining qualities of the loop compositional style he is known for. Braxton currently resides in New York City, New York, United States. 

Collaboratively, Braxton has also worked with Prefuse73, Risil and Glenn Branca, and has been commissioned by the Kronos Quartet and Bang on a Can, amongst others. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tyondai+Braxton">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
