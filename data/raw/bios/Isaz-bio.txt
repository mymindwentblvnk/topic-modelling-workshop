There are two bands named Isaz:

1) A German black metal band formed in 1996. They released 3 demos and a split with Wolfsschrei before splitting up.

2) A black metal band from Novosibirsk, Russia (also known as |, Isa and Иса). Apart from participating on a split with Княжая Пустынь and Лесной Танец in 2014 (titled 'Сплетение'), they released 2 full-lengths:

- Песни мёртвых (Songs of the dead), 2014
- Отход на закате (Departure at sunset), 2015

The sound of the Russian Isaz is heavily influenced by black metal, but also incorporates elements from folk music, ambient and post-punk. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Isaz">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
