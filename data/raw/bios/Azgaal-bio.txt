2001, Naïwyn start to write music for a demo tape. With Ibuprohet, they record a 3 tracks demo that will not go out. No gigs was planed also. AZGAAL is born by a need to express feelings. It's an outlet. There's no ideology behind the project and no trendy  motivations. It's a passion for music. A personal aspect of life turned into sounds.
 
After reflections and discussions, the band put out "Solitude & Wisdom" in 2011 and start to share the Rock & Roll vision of AZGAAL's Black metal. Then, with a friend of Naïwyn. Mr.Olc will record some vocals on special tracks which weren't previous for an AZGAAL release. Naîwyn decided to put them out anyway as a special compilation of B-side songs so "Naïwyn's book of shadows" will go out the summer 2011.
 
A year passed away. A year where Ibuprohet left the band for personal matters. Now, Naïwyn is finishing the new album "a matter of death" alone. Previous to be out this spring! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Azgaal">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
