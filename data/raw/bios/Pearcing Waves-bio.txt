Pearcing Waves were originally formed in March 2008 by Vasilis (Drums) and Kuriakos (Guitar).After a few months and while the band was still performing covers George(Vocals) and Thomas(Bass) joined. The band was solid enough to build its own songs. However ,Kostas replaced Thomas on Bass guitar duties.

In November 2010 Christos (guitars) joined the band in order to contribute to the bandâ€™s spirit and bring new/fresh ideas in songwriting.

The band released a 3 song self titled Demo in Dec 2010 and continue writing material for the full length album which would probably see light in 2011. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/pEARcing+Waves">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
