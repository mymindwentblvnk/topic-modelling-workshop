Dead Earth Politics came to be in October of 2005, when vocalist Ven Scott was officially inducted. Previously known as "Dirtbox" in the Austin area, Mason Evans, Will Little and Ernie Clark decided it was time to make some fundamental changes both within the band and in the Austin Metal Scene itself. A year after rehearsing and writing with Scott, Dead Earth Politics released their demo, "Mark the Resistance". Immediately given airplay on the local metal show, "No Control", as well as stations in Laredo and through out Texas.

The metal quartet began to spread their grasp across Texas while fighting to maintain their presence in their hometown. In August of 2008, they entered the studio to record their first full length album, "Target Rich". With the self financed album now called "The Weight of Poseidon" and their new partnership with Genuine Recordings, Dead Earth Politics is poised to push this new piece of art forward. 2009 was a milestone year with the band having made their way through the Mid and Southwest.

2011 promises to be a stronger year, with Dead Earth Politics focusing on the same target areas as 2010 and many, many new ones! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dead+Earth+Politics">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
