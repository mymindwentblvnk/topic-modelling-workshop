Peak Twilight is a project started in Switzerland by a teenager with the endeavor of a musical journey without words. A mixture of ambient, groovy and orchestral music is the product of over a decade of classical and jazz piano education. While growing in a multi-cultural environment, music has always been something to express himself in a unified way to everyone independent of countries, cultures, and languages. This is why he pursues music since the age of 5 as a hobby next to his studies. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Peak+Twilight">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
