We are Timesailor, a progressive rock-metal band from Ankara, Turkey. As our old friends know, our previous name was Apoplexy and we had to change it because of the increasing number of the bands named Apoplexy from different cities, countries. As Apoplexy, we have played at lots of festivals and concerts in Turkey, recorded a demo named "Sun of Paradise" and gained our own audience from all over the world. Our ex-vocalist Beren decided to leave the band and we met our new vocalists Bulutay Gunes and Damla Ozdemir. Now you can listen them in our new single 'Sonbahar' available at our myspace profile and here on Last.Fm. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Timesailor">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
