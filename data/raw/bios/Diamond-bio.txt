There are four artists with this name

1. DIAMOND, from Baltimore, Maryland. Featuring members of Trapped Under Ice and Down to Nothing, Diamond started writing in early 2010, with the release of an ambitious demo shortly thereafter. In collaboration with Photobooth Records, DIAMOND's first vinyl offering serves up five fresh songs of catchy pop/rock tunes not unlike contemporaries Jimmy Eat World or Weezer, not to mention 90's predecessors such as Samiam or Nada Surf. All influences aside, the band has a very distinctive sound that's guranteed to leave you humming for days. Don't take your eyes off this band, as they have a 7" approaching (expected to be out sometime in November.) -500 copies with screenprinted covers.
