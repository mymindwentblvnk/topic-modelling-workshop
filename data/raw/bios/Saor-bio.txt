Saor, meaning "Free" in Scottish and Irish Gaelic, is a one-man metal band from Glasgow, Scotland formed in 2012 by Andy Marshall. Saor's sound is a blend of styles influenced by Scottish folk music, atmospheric black metal and post-rock, using traditional Celtic folk instruments such as tin whistle, bagpipes and bodhr√°n together with the raw power and emotion of black metal and atmospheric elements of post-rock. Lyrically the band deals with themes of Scottish heritage, Highland nature/landscapes and sorrow, influenced by a deep connection to the Scottish Highlands, its culture and history. As well as composing original lyrics, some are derived from the works of famous Scottish poets. The band is currently signed to German label Northern Silence Productions.
