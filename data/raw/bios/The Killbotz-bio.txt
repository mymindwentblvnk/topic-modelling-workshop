The KillbotZ, formed in the suburban Chicago area, are known for having very high energy shows, an old school thrash-meets-blues sound, and having a very DIY approach to everything.

Like most bands, The KillbotZ have an extensive list of influences. However you are much more likely to hear bands like Metallica, Motorhead, and Jimi Hendrix taking the majority of influence over their sound. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Killbotz">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
