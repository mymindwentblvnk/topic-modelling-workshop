Prayed and Betrayed is a five-piece act from Jyväskylä (Finland). It was found in summer 2012. A thought about waking a band like this alive had been in our guitarists minds for a few years already. Panu and Antti had been making songs while searching for other musicians to make the band whole. In July 2012 the roster settled on Jani Tammiainen (Vocals), Antti Lukkari (Guitar), Panu Korhonen (Guitar), Lauri Myllylä (Bass), Juho Suomi (Drums).

At the end of the year band recorded a 6 track self-produced EP "Manifesting Reality" (2012) at the SN-audio Studios by Sami Niittykoski. The band started promoting "Manifesting Reality" with live shows. 

In June 2013 the band recorded their first single called ”Asylum Of Wanderers”. Soon after the band started to work on brand new material. In the fall of 2013 Lauri decided to leave the band so there was a place open for a new bass player. So by the end of the year they found the man for the job (Otto Puusaari). Prayed And Betrayed found a new singer for upcoming EP (Tatu Hanhikoski) from Jyväskylä in 2014. 

The band had a few training sessions and was ready for the studio. The band recorded the debut promo "The Abundance of a Sickened Mind" (2014) at the SN-Audio Studios by Teemu Liekkala.
"The Abundance of a Sickened Mind" is now available digitally and will be released in physical form in the beginning of July. 01.07.2014.

The CD also features some exquisite guest appearance from;
Tatu Hanhikoski - Vocals
