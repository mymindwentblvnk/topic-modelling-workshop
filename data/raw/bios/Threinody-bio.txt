In the Year 1996, in the bustling heart of the Indian City of Bangalore, arose three restless teenage souls with a common vision of exploring the art of creating an intense aural and visual experience. This small band of musicians evolved into an entity, titled Threinody, a name derived from the language of the ancient Greeks, signifying a song of grief, a dirge.
 
Threinody comprises: 

Premik Jolly:Lead/Rhythm Guitar and Keyboards
Siddharth J. Naidu:Bass Guitar and Vocals
Satish Raj:Drums and Backing Vocals

This trio engaged themselves in creating a sound, shaped by various sources of inspiration, ranging from the dark intensity of Slayer, the all-enveloping Pink Floyd sound, to the sonic heaviness of early Metallica. The influences and playing styles are distilled into a heady, spicy waltz bordering on speed / thrash metal.
