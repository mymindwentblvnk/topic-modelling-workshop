'After early – mostly improvised – recording work between Drone and Free Jazz (among others also with Sören Sörensen and Panzerdivision Copacabana), Tesk is the new solo debut of Edis Ludwig. This sounds like abstract ambient, it sounds like noise, and live it turns into a rhythmic world rich of pictorial language.'
