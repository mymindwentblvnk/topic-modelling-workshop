Christ Inversion was formed in 1994; a blackened death metal/black metal project formed by Phil Anselmo; Crushing riffs, thunderous drums, and atmospheric keyboards entwine each extreme composition and complement Wayne’s vocal torture to make Christ Inversion a compelling and unforgiving listen. Although often compared with early 80s bands such as Hellhammer and Venom, and early 90s bands such as Beherit and Darkthrone, Christ Inversion’s distinctive sound clearly separates them from any other “Black Metal” band, The band describes their sound as "The venomous vomit of Satan".The first demo was re-released in 2004 by Funeral in Hell Records, the second demo was re-released on Anselmo's own Housecore Records on October 28, 2008.
