Trollheimen from Csorna, Hungary has been around since 2002, but they are a very young band, the average age is 19 years. Their influences are mostly from the Gothenburg death metal scene, with bands like In Flames, Dark Tranquillity, the early Amorphis, Amon Amarth, but a lot of other bands have been influential to them.

They have already played many gigs in bigger towns in Hungary and also played at the international Mediawave festival.

Their first demo, „Fragile Constellation”, was recorded in 2003 and it was warmly welcomed by the Hungarian rock - metal media. They played lots of gigs again and went through some line up changes. A new drummer, vocalist and keyboard player joined the band.

This year Trollheimen went to the studio again and recorded a promotional cd, "Az elmúlás útján..." (On the way of passing…) with that they would like to win the wide public. - 2005 

In 2008 Trollheimen disbanded after a long, unsuccessful search of a vocalist.
