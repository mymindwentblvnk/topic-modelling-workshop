Fuera is a Spanish word that means “outside”. The meaning has significant appeal to the band, as their music strives to move outside of the conventions of genre and expectations, constantly pushing sonic boundaries while being true to their respective roots.

Fuera is a progressive death metal band and drawing strongly from the varied musical influences of its
four members. "We believe in creating beautiful and dark music that is heavy, contrasted and dynamic".

The band surfaced out of the relatively quiet town of Franschhoek, South Africa, when guitarist, and now vocalist, Nicholas Kerr approached drummer Francios Meyer to start up a metal project. Since its inception in July 2014, Fuera has recruited bassist and graphic designer Greg Williams and lead guitarist/vocalist Josh Cole-Mitchell. The band officially began under the name Fuera and with the current line-up in December 2014 and is now based in Cape Town. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fuera">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
