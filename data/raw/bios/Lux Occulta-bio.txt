Lux Occulta (Latin for "hidden light") is the name of a Polish symphonic black metal band, founded in late 1994. Their work, also strongly influenced by progressive metal, commonly incorporates elaborate arrangements often featuring multiple sections and unpredictable time signature changes. The band was dormant from 2002 until 2012 due to "various reasons" including the lack of a drummer; they returned in 2014 with Kołysanki, a radical change in direction consisting almost exclusively of avant-garde electronic music.
