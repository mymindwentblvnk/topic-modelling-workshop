S.V.E.S.T. (“Satanas Vobiscum Et Spiritum Tuo”) is fronted by the Asmodee and Cantus Bestiae credited Spica on vocals with instrumentation provided by Darkkarma. They came to life in 1997 in Nantes, Pays de la Loire, France. The duo debuted in 1998 with the two song demo cassette ‘Scarification Of Soul’. The following year Gorification Musix distributed the follow up, ‘Death To Macrocosm’, restricted to just 66 copies.

In 2001 S.V.E.S.T. included the track ‘The Alpha Wolf’s Anger’ onto the infamous Sombre Records four way split EP ‘Black Metal Endsieg I’ shared with Black Witchery, Katharsis and Warloghe. A further split offering surfaced the following year, the track ‘Death To Macrocosm’ included on a 7” shared with Germany’s Azaxul, once again through Sombre Records. S.V.E.S.T. issued the ‘Urfaust’ offering through End All Life Productions in January of 2003.

The band's latest new release is currently Veritas diaboli manet in aeternum: Le Diable est ma raison, released on CD as an EP and on vinyl as the B-side of a split with Deathspell Omega (Veritas diaboli manet in aeternum).
