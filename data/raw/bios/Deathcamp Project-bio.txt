Deathcamp Project was formed in October 2001 as a direct reaction to an obvious lack of goth-rock sounds within Polish dark, independent music scene.

During the last years Void (vocals, guitars, lyrics) and Betrayal (bass, keyboards, production) have created their own, intriguing mixture of sounds taking their inspiration from goth-rock of The Sisters of Mercy, Joy Division, The Cure and Fields of the Nephilim, deathrock of Christian Death, electro sound of Clan of Xymox as well as murderous sound of a drum machine (a nod towards industrial group Laibach). The combination works well with a polished, dark image the band presents on stage.

Rhytmic and somewhat catchy songs combined with an original tone of Void's voice make the band easily recognisable on both Polish and international independent scene. Simultaneously they have acquired a faithful following,

The band has played at many club events and big festivals in:

- Czech Republic
- Germany (f.e. Wave Gotik Treffen)
- Great Britain
- Hungary
- Lithuania
- Poland (f.e. Castle Party)
- Slovakia
- Ukraine

And supported at club gigs such great bands as:

- Christian Death
- Cinema Strange
- Clan of Xymox
- Closterkeller
- Fields of the Nephilim
- NFD 
- The Birthday Massacre

Records released by the band's own means, including:

- ...And The Deathly Hallows - sp (2008)
- seXimeR - mcd (2007) - mini-album of remixes
- Laxa(c)tivE - ep (2004)
- Away From You - sp (2003)
- Wired - demo (2002)
- End - demo (2001)

were greeted with enthusiastic reactions and resulted in tens of successful gigs in Poland and abroad. What is more, records sold through the band's own distribution channels have reached a few thousands mark in Poland and other coutries alone.

Nowadays Deathcamp Project can boast a stable position on the independent scene as well as being the only band with such concrete achievements. The band has finished working on the material for their debut album, entitled "Well-Known Pleasures" and came out: 13.10.2008.

Deathcamp's songs were played in numerous radio shows, resulting in the song Dead Hours being included on the prestige compilation album "Minimax pl 3", compiled by Piotr Kaczkowski [called "Polish John Peel"] himself and released by Polish Radio 3. Compilation sold over 11 thousands copies.
