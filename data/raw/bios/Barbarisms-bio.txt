Barbarisms are a Stockholm band – singing in English (or Americana, if you like) – and their self-titled debut record, a wide-open-spaces, road-trip of an album which touches on early REM and lo-folk, and retains a lightly fried sense of nostalgia around the edges. It pulls off the trick of sounding world-weary but with eyes opened wide. Their sophomore record, Browser, was released in June 2016. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Barbarisms">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
