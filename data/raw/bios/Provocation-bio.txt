Provocation is a Brutal Death Metal band from Germany.

After rehearsing and jamming around for months, the original members Sascha K. (guitar) and Philipp B. (drums) founded the band PROVOCATION in 2004. Soon the bassplayer Nasar S. joined the band. With Steffen J. the second guitarplayer was found to fit in. Last but not least Bastian J. took over the vocalpart. With this line-up PROVOCATION did their live debut in december 2004. 


Several gigs should follow over the years. PROVOCATION shared the stage with well-known bands like DEFEATED SANITY, NAPALM DEATH, INFECTED MALIGNITY, NECROPHAGIST, FLESHLESS, DEADBORN, ROMPEPROP, PROSTITUTE DISFIGUREMENT, JIG-AI, PIGSTY, PUNGENT STENCH, BLOOD DUSTER, ARSEBREED, VOMIT THE SOUL, IMPURE and many more. 

In the beginning the band used to play a mix of Mid-Tempo Death and Thrash Metal provided with many melodic and grind parts. Over the months the style evolved and the music became more brutal. Of course the speed has risen dramatically. But the lyrical range is still constant. In their lyrics the band works through political and sociocritical issues. 

In summer/fall 2006 Steffen J. (guitar) left the band due to personal reasons. He got fully replaced by Manuel C. (guitar). 

Meanwhile the band played Technichal Brutal Death Metal. 

The musical influences of Manuel C. (guitar) should attract attention to themselves soon. The style became less technical but more catchy and even more brutal. Henceforth the band plays Brutal Death Metal. Nasar S. (bass) and Sascha K. (guitar) left the band due to personal and job-related reasons in fall 2007.
In fall 2007 Daniel E. joined the band as a bassist. 
In March 2008 PROVOCATION joined the MUTILATED RECORDS family!
