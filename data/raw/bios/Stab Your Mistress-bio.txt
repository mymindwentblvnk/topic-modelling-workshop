Born in the late 2005 under the guardianship of 4 motivated musicians, the entity STAB YOUR MISTRESS only sees the day in Lille (north of France) a few months later, the rehearsals getting each day more and more productive. The band's name is then adopted for its obvious metaphorical meaning and a violent tone clearly announcing what themes would be dealt with, but also the musical way took by the band, already determined to hammer down some kind of death and thrash metal betting on a ruthless and powerful sound. The machine puts itself on the road, materially supported by fred, manager of the 666 WILD WILD CLUB, where the band weekly rehearses. The band records its first demo in October 2006. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Stab+Your+Mistress">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
