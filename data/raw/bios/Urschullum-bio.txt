The Czech HC formation URSCHULLUM was created in 1991. That was when “The WC Gentlemen, WC Ladies“, the only demo cassette in the group history, was made.
The band concentrated on performing live rather then making studio recordings. That is also the reason why there have not been any more demo cassettes made even though the style of their music has moved towards much harder and more original mode. What had been made were only promo recordings for magazines, labels and necessary promotion.
During the year  1997 the group made a debut CD called “Psyco Noiz From Da 666 Psyco Hoad“. The album contained 16 songs and was released one year later within the Czech label of the 99 RECORDS.
After two years on the Czech and Slovak stages the URSCHULLUM came back to the studio to record another album  “Hell Core“ (11 songs). This was released in 2003 presented again by the 99 RECORDS. Before this CD was released the compositon called “Bloodandsugar“ was included in the CD compilation of the Spark magazine (January 2003).
 
Although the group had started working on new compositons  by the end of summer 2004 they decided to terminate their operation temporarily for being too busy in their main bands (MASTER ,  SHAARK) <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Urschullum">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
