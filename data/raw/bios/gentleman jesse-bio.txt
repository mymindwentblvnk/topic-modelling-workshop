Gentleman Jesse & His Men are another fresh slice of inspired, lo-fi, garage pop brilliance on par with the sounds of The Beat, The Exploding Hearts, The Barracudas, and the good stuff Tom Petty did before your dad’s buddies started calling him their hero. Jesse and Dave from the the Carbonas have assembled a squad of tightly configured personnel who can channel the free spirit of the Carter administration and infuse it with a snappy and indulgent Case/Collins framework of rock’n roll ecstacy, and the results are thouroughly pleasing on all levels. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gentleman+Jesse">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
