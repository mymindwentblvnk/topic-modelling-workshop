Decaying Days, formed in 2010, is a melodic death doom metal band from MÃ¼nster, Germany. With a fine mixture of calm parts, mid-tempo-riffs and catchy melodies this band unites their influences from "Insomnium" to "Before the Dawn" and "Dark Tranquillity". Since 2010 we were undergoing a constant process of writing songs, taking them to our rehearsal room to figure out whether they're good enough. After struggling with some lineup changes, the band is now complete and we're working towards our album and of course we try to play live as much as possible since those two things have always been our primary goals. When our Drummer Nico and Manuel were looking for musicians to form a new band we were heavily inspired by Finnish doom-death bands and that's what most of our ideas sounded like. As the band was forming over time, everyone was putting lots of work into our songwriting and of course thisinfluenced the songs. We guess that is how our sound developed. Our lyrics are heavily inspired by the feel the instrumental song emits. Usually we sit together and hear a prerecording of a song and then we come up with whatever theme the song makes you think about. This way the lyrics get more emotional impact than the other way round. All of the songwriting for our upcoming album is done and we're rehearsing and prerecording everything. If everything goes well we'll be hitting the studio in January 2017 and the album should be available shortly after. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Decaying+Days">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
