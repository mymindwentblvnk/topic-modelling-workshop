SADVILLE (Cookeville & Knoxville, Tennessee) play an aggressive mixture of stoner doom, hardcore, thrash, punk and just ballsy metal.  The eclectic mixing of these genres has created a blasting noise-ridden riff fest with extremely hard-hitting drums.  They have released one full length LP (Make Ready the Cross [Inkblot Records]) and a few EPs and planned 7" splits.
