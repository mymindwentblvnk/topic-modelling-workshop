Tinted Windows is an American power pop band that consists of Taylor Hanson (Hanson), James Iha (A Perfect Circle, formerly with The Smashing Pumpkins), Adam Schlesinger (Fountains of Wayne, Ivy) and Bun E. Carlos (Cheap Trick).

It was a side project for all four band members. 

Their debut self-titled album was released on April 21, 2009.  This turned out to be their only release.  In May 2021, following the death of Schlesinger due to Covid in 2020, the remaining three members reunited for a tribute to their comrade:  https://youtu.be/CcXscp_hxqE <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tinted+Windows">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
