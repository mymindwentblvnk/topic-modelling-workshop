Depressive/Atmospheric Black Metal from the The Netherlands. 

Beyond Light was formed in the middle of 2007 by Belfalas. Influenced by depressive black metal bands of that time, the Demo 2007 with raw quality was released soon after. In December 2008 the second demo-EP was released called The Blessing Of A Dead Sun.

In July 2009 the third demo After..Before was released. Belfalas also made a re-arrangement of The Blessing Of A Dead Sun that year, and re-recorded it including new elements as The Scars Of Daylight, which came out in November 2009. 

The Album Eclipsed Sun Path with a more Atmospheric and better sound saw it's light in November 2010.
