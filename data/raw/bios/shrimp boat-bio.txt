Shrimp Boat (1985-1993) were a rock band from Chicago. The original lineup formed when Ian Schneller, David Kroll and Sam Prekop met in art school; later editions added Ian's brother Eric (who later went by Eric Claridge) and then Brad Wood.  The more usual guitar-bass-drums-vocal lineup was expanded on many songs with banjo, saxophone, and occasionally trumpet, cello, and Ian's home-built instruments.  Their music evolved through relentless gigging from a primitive, improvisational folk-inflected sound to a more "normal" pop sound, which nonetheless kept the loose, playful vibe of their early experiments.

Post-Boat, Prekop and Claridge went on to form The Sea and Cake, and Sam Prekop has also had a solo career. Brad Wood established himself as a producer, cutting records for Liz Phair, Veruca Salt and other notable alternative rock acts.  Ian Schneller formed another band, Falstaff, which put out two albums; he now has a business building custom guitars and amplifiers. http://www.specimenproducts.com/ <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Shrimp+Boat">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
