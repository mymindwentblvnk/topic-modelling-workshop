FLOODSTAIN is a stoner rock n roll band from Hellevoetsluis, Holland. Started out a couple of years back as Between. We were searching for the sound we wanted. With some line up changes we emerged into a full blooded stoner rock n roll band with many gigs under our belt. In 2001 we brought out the first real Floodstain album called 'Get it on" (after some previous recordings before that) that featured a sound heading in a direction we wanted. Got some great reviews, did many gigs again to re enter the studio in 2005 to record 'Take a ride". On the stage again and always wanting to do more gigs is the way we want to walk. Watch out for new recordings in 2006 showing different approaches on the floodstain sound but never without the rock n roll feeling!!!! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Floodstain">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
