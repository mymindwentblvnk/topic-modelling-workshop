The goliath bird eating spider (Theraphosa blondi) is an arachnid belonging to the tarantula family and is the largest spider in the world. It was discovered and named by Bobb Bruno (Eagle Rock, CA). Birdeaters are defensive and may make a hissing noise when disturbed. This noise is called stridulation and is produced when the spider rubs the bristles on its legs together; creating a distorted, abrasive, drone-dirge lasting up to 20 minutes. Wild goliath birdeaters are a deep burrowing species, found commonly in marshy or swampy areas. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Goliath+Bird+Eater">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
