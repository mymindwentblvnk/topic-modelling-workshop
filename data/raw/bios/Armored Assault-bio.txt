https://www.facebook.com/ArmoredAssaultMusic. Armored Assault has been at it for over 17 years, relentlessly rehearsing, writing, and playing shows. With two official releases under their belt, Dead Before Dawn (2011) and Call The Beast (2014), the assault continues nearly seven years later, except this time around more assertive and explosive than ever. Blood Queen will be the band’s first release to feature the dexterity of guitarist Tony Notardonato and the slamming bass work of Billy McDonald, rounding out the core lineup of lead singer Andy “Pindy” Pindelski, shredding guitarist Tommy Bellino, and hard-hitting drummer Mark Suttner.
"Armored Assault is pure thrashing mayhem! Chugging bullet train of evil guitar riffs, ripping solos, breakneck tempos, and demonic shouting will keep you thrashing til death!"
We have opened for touring bands like Diecast, Skeletonwitch, Devin Townsend, Jungle Rot, Toxic Holocaust, Holy Grail, Warbringer, In Flames, Mobile Deathcamp & more.
