"Ethereal Blood" is a Symphonic Black Metal band Hailing from the Chicago suburbs. The original booze soaked line-up consisted of; Andrew Miller "Abyss" (currently on Bass) on Guitar and vocals, Zakk Gebe "Pestilence" on Drums. Later the addition of Luke Lisner the young and illustrous "Lord Vardoulacha" on Lead Guitar and vocals, next we aquired Nate Reeve "Quortheaon"on Synth and Keyboards gracing us with his attractive persona and eagerness to expand his knowledge. We curently are looking for a rhythm guitarist. We have just finished the process of writing our debut album "Cold Crypt Sonnatas Vol. I". We are in the process of recording, we hope to have it on our page soon. Thank you all stay Dark!
