The Crown is a death/thrash metal band formed in Trollh채ttan, Sweden in 1990. Their original moniker (until 1998) was Crown of Thorns for the band's first two albums, which had to be changed due to another band already using that name.

Their music and lyrics are inspired by death, anti-religion themes (mostly targeting Christianity) and rebellion. They are known to fuse death metal with thrash influences. 

The Crown disbanded in 2004. Lindstrand went on to form One Man Army and the Undead Quartet. Tervonen and Saarenp채채 formed Angel Blake, named after a song by Danzig. Despite having broken up they made one last release as a tribute to their fans. A triple DVD set containing live shows, and bootlegs.

The Crown reformed in December 2009, without vocalist Johan Lindstrand. Jonas St책lhammar of God Macabre is the new vocalist.

As of September 9th 2011, Johan Lindstrand has resumed vocal duties in The Crown. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Crown">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
