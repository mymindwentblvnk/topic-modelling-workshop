There are two bands and an improv group called The Beets.

1. The Beets are a fictional band created for Nickelodeon's early 90's TV show, Doug.

Despite the fictional band having four songs known at most, it is not unusual for "beetniks" to experience strong feelings of nostalgia when playing through these tracks which most likely hit the net through popular music downloading agents such as Kazaa, Limewire, and Napster in the late 90's - early 2000's.

The fictional group is composed of the characters Monroe Yoder, Wendy Nespot, Flounder, and Chap Lipman.

2. The Beets are a garage rock/psychedelic band from Jackson Heights, NY. Lots of reverb, minimalistic drumming, some backwoods vibes, and shouted vocals sung by all three band members. Similar to Thee Oh Sees. They recently released their debut, Spit In The Face Of People Who Don't Want To Be Cool, which was limited to 200 hand-painted copies, on Blank Dogs' label Captured Tracks.

3. There is also a Brooklyn improv duo that goes by the same name.  This unit is comprised of John Dalessi (Dirty Churches) on keyboards, 4-track with cassettes, electronics, and cymbal and Adam Kriney (La Otracina/Owl Sounds) on drums/percussion, electric bass and electronics.   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Beets">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
