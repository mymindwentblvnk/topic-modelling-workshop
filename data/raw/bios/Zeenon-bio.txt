Zeenon is a death metal band from Oslo, Norway. They play metal with a distinctive blend of hypnotising speed, higher order technique and destabilising Budgiesque riffs.

The band was started in 1995, and released several self-financed demos. Their EP Against the World from 2000 landed them a gig at the Inferno Festival in Oslo, Norway.

In 2005 they released their first official album Blood Vessel Criteria on Retribute Records.

The band is also special in heavy metal music, because 3 of the 4 members are female (Mads on drums being the only male member). The vocals performed by Linn is screamed and grunted, much like Angela Gossow from Arch Enemy (although many may find Zeenon to play a more brutal form of death metal).
