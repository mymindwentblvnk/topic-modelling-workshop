Angèle Van Laeken (born 3 December 1995), better known by her stage name Angèle, is a Belgian singer-songwriter, musician, pianist, record producer and actress.

Angèle Van Laeken is the daughter of the singer Marka and of the actress Laurence Bibot. She was born in Uccle, Brussels-Capital Region. Her father encouraged her from an early age to learn the piano, which inspired her musical career. Angèle spent a difficult adolescence in a strict Catholic school before attending the Decroly School. The artistic options at this high school helped develop her musical skills. She then enrolled in the Jazz Studio Antwerp for a jazz education before joining her father's band.

Angèle gave her first performances in cafés around Brussels. She was first noticed for her cover of Dick Annegarn, "Bruxelles", and on Instagram videos where she mixed singing and comedy. In 2017, she was the support act for Ibeyi and the Belgian rapper Damso, whom she also accompanied in his album Lithopédion. Her first single, "La Loi de Murphy", was released in late 2017 and received millions of views on YouTube. A second single "Je veux tes yeux" was released in early 2018. The two video clips were directed by the Belgian photographer Charlotte Abramow.

Angèle is a fan of Ella Fitzgerald and Hélène Ségara. She is inspired by many musical genres from French songs to electronic music and rap, which she disliked as a teenager. She became influenced by rap particularly while performing with her brother Romeo Elvis and the rappers Caballero and JeanJass. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ang%C3%A8le">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
