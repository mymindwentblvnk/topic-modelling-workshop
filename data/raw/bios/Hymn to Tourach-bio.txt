Hymn to Tourach is a two man Nationalistic Black Metal band from the northern regions of New Zealand, combining black metal, symphonic melodies and elements of RAC. The band has developed from straight raw Black Metal to a more refined, melodic/epic sound, whilst remaining true to the core musical principles of Black Metal. Created in early 2004 by Thorsten, the band has released one demo (Rise From Ancestral Shadow) and one Ep (The Fourth Arm of The Sun)which was delayed release after Thorsten was investigated by the Police in regards to church desecrations and the assault on several Maori youths. Guitarist 'Ea' dropped out from the project due to a personal resentment towards Thorstens seemingly reckless behaviour and the ideological direction in which he was taking the band. The current Hymn to Tourach lineup ( Thorsten & Heinrich )are currently working on new material for the upcoming full length release on Schutzstaffel Productions. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hymn+To+Tourach">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
