With the line-up complete Deafness began rehearsing six days a week and continued to write material for their debut full length CD. Since the release of "Louder Than All" the band has completed a two week intensive CD release mini-tour of the Los Angeles/Hollywood area finishing up at the world famous Wiskey A Go-Go. Currently they are continuing to tour and promote their CD across the North East with plans to return to West Coast in early 2005. 

"On the same vein as Clutch, Pappa Roach and Godsmack, Deafness has found a pure form of Hard Rock that just slams. High energy rock with a soulful singing sound."
