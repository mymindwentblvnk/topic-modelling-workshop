Planningtorock (all one word, often just PTR) is the vehicle of expression of Jam Rostron , a musician and visual artist from Bolton, Manchester, UK who started out in 2004 and has lived in Berlin for ten years. They have released four full-lengths so far, the latest being Powerhouse (2018), preceded by All Love's Legal (2014), W (2011) and their 2006 debut Have It All, which was a full-on chamber-pop romp that established Planningtorock as anything but orthodox. 

W, Planningtorock's critically acclaimed 2011 debut on DFA, revealed a visionary and politicised producer. It offered up deeply queered art-pop – tense, atmospheric dance music cut with classical flourishes, and spell-binding androgyny. But it was 2014’s All Love's Legal (“a masterclass in left-of-centre dance music”, Mixmag), released on Rostron's own imprint Human Level, where Planningtorock, with banner-ready slogans (‘ Patriarchy Over And Out’, ‘ Let's Talk About Gender Baby’), revealed their ability to combine pop-oriented music with a political message. Powerhouse offers up something infinitely more personal: emotionally-charged, biographical anthems drawn from Rostron’s lived experiences as a non-binary genderqueer artist, experiences around family, identity and music itself. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Planningtorock">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
