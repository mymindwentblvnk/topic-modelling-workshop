The band was formed in early 2007 by Toke Eld, Jeppe Hasseriis and Andreas Lynge. They were all three members of Usipian and wanted to take things further after Usipian split up in january 2007 and immediately started composing new songs. 

Toke and Jeppe knew Martin Rosendahl from previous bands and he was quickly acquired for taking care of the bass. Finding a drummer should prove to be a little difficult, but after serveral months Morten Løwe Sørensen proved to be the right man for the job. At last after half a year a name was finally decided for the group.

The band worked hard resulting in 10 song after 7 months. Morten went straight to Hansen Studio in October only 2 months later and recorded the drumtracks for the debut album entitled "Poisoned Legacy". The album was released worldwide by US label Deepsend Records on June 9 2009 and on Danish soil May 18 2009. The album is availabe at Deepsend.com, Amazon, iTunes and other webshops.

The album was well received and was nominated for "Best Metal Debut" at Danish Metal Awards and voted "Best Metal Debut of 2009" at www.metalzone.dk.

In 2010 The Cleansing went on tour with the Danish band Dawn of Demise. The tour marked the last involvement of Martin Rosendahl, who was later replaced by Mads Haarløv. 
The band also started recording the follow-up album to "Poisoned Legacy" at CB Studios, Denmark. The 2nd album, entitled "Feeding the Inevitable", is mastered by Björn Engelmann at Cutting Room Studios (SE) who also worked with Behemoth, Meshuggah and Bloodbath among others.
