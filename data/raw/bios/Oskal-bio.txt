Very raw and primitive NSBM from Russia. Currently on Stellar Winter label and have so far released a single album called Stahlkrieg. The word Oskal refers to the act of an animal showing its teeth to frighten his enemy.


Stahlkrieg consists of two demos, previously unreleased. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Oskal">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
