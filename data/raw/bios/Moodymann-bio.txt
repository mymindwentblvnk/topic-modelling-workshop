Kenny Dixon Jr.,[6] better known by his stage name Moodymann, is an American musician based in Detroit, Michigan.[7] He is the owner of the record labels Mahogani Music and KDJ Records.[8] He is a member of 3 Chairs.[9] 

In 1997, Moodymann released his debut album, Silentintroduction, on Planet E Communications.[10] It compiled the previously released tracks from his own KDJ Records.[11] He released Mahogany Brown in 1998,[12] Forevernevermore in 2000,[13] and Silence in the Secret Garden in 2003.[14]
In 2012, he released Picture This as a free download.[15] It was followed by ABCD in 2013.[16] His self-titled album, Moodymann, was released in 2014.[17] He released Sinner in 2019,[18] and Taken Away in 2020.[19] In December 2020, Moodymann appeared as himself in the video game Grand Theft Auto Online, serving as one of the resident DJs at the newly-opened nightclub called the Music Locker.[20] 
Moodymann is considered to have "developed hybrid modes of recording and performance incorporating analog and digital mediaâ€”the playing of 'real' instruments with 'pushing buttons live'."[21] Philip Sherburne of Pitchfork wrote: "His sample-heavy productions have drawn on artists like Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, and Chic, not to mention gospel music, and his beats have always remained rooted in disco's bump and swirl."[22]

In January 2019, Moodymann released a video on Instagram, which he later removed, showing the Highland Park police holding him at gunpoint in his parked car, on his property.[23] The Highland Park police department released a statement saying that during the incident, Moodymann did not show proof of ownership of the property or even an ID, which led to the arrest.[24] Moodymann was later released after an investigation showing that he was indeed the owner of the property.[24] <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Moodymann">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
