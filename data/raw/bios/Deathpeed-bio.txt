One of Japan's first ever death metal bands, Deathpeed existed in the mid-to-late '80s and featured vocalist Takaho Komatsu, who went on to form grindcore legends Unholy Grave. Primarily death metal, they also took much influence from both thrash metal and early hardcore/grindcore, going so far as to cover UK hardcore legends Heresy.

A compilation CD of Deathpeed live and demo material was recently released. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Deathpeed">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
