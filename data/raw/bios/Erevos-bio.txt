2) Erevos is a black metal band from Thessaloniki, Greece, formed in October 2004 by Growler (vocals, bass), Tisifoni (keyboards) and Kerberus (guitar). They had problems finding a drummer.In the summer of 2005 L'Drac (Frozen Glare, Shadowcraft, Leachim, Witchcurse) joined the band. On August 2005 the first demo, "Burning Souls", was ready. The reviews were very good, but soon Kerberus left the band for personal reasons. Soon they found two guitarists, Silmour (Frozen Glare) and Shadowstorm (ex-bassist of Terrordrome). On July of 2006 the demo "Mythological Evil" was ready. The material is more aggressive and technical. The lyrics are about Greek Mythology and Satanism. After both guitarists left the band, Decomposer (Plasma) took their place. After Several live appearances all over Greece, in 2007 they released a split with Satanicon (USA), on Deathtoll Productions (USA). In 2008 another release came out by Satanhades Productions (Portugal). This release contains the two demos in a DVD case. In Winter of 2009 they recorded a promo titled "Adou Katavasis" and the mastering was done by Dan Swano (Edge Of Sanity, Bloodbath) at Unisound studios in Sweden.
