Tiwanaku (tee-wa-na-koo), also spelled Tiahuanaco, lies in the Andes Mountains of Bolivia near the Southern Peruvian border. There have been mixed reports on how old this site actually is. Reports say that it is about 17000 years old!! Yes that's older than they say Stonehenge is which makes Tiwanaku the oldest known site still standing in the world. This ancient site is rumored to have been a focal point for the arrival of extraterrestrials thousands of years ago on this planet. There is also rumors that these ancient visitors are the ancestors of man. The main focal point of this tremendous city is a monolith called "The Gateway to the Sun". Ancient legends tell tales that this gateway was used as a door for transportation to other dimensions and realms.
