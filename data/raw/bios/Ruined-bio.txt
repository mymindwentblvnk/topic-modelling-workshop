There are multiple bands called Ruined:

1. Gloomy shoegaze drum and bass band, formed in 2013 in Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA. Where much shoegaze frolics in the summer twilight, this Grand Rapids duo plods through the cold night. With just bass and drums, they’re able to cover a lot of dark ground. Sometimes their sound is delicate and lovely, sometimes harsh and heavy, but always bleak and dejected. There’s something strangely invigorating about such a sustained look into the shadows. The band consists of Zach Meier (Bass/Vocals) and Sky Moy (Drums.)

2. (폐허) Dark ambient/atmospheric black metal solo project from South Korea. Lyrical themes include nature, anti-war, sorrow, and depression.

3. German power violence/hardcore band featuring members of Kent Brockman. They have put out a self titled 7” EP and a split with Bloodred Bacteria.

4. Swiss emo/punk band formed in 2020. The group is influenced by bands like Title Fight, Basement or Citizen and have two EPs out. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ruined">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
