Infusion is a dance/electronica group from Wollongong, Australia formed by Frank Xavier, Manny Sharrad and Jamie Stevens. It was initially involved in the mid-90's Australian rave scene, penning the anthems "Smokescreen" and "Green".

Infusion's debut album was released in Australia in 2000. "Phrases and Numbers" had several singles, including "Legacy" and "Starwater, It's Alright", both of which were favorites of DJ Dave Seaman who had in turn released remixes of Infusion songs on his "Audio Therapy" label. 

Their second LP, "Six Feet Above Yesterday",  was released in 2004, along with three singles: Girls Can Be Cruel, Better World (both 2004) and Natural (2005).

Their current album, "All Night Sun Light" was released independently in Australia in July this year. Singles include "Dogtown" and "2-Player Game", with more to be released later this year.

They have just done a video clip for the latest Australian single "Try It On", which is getting good airplay on JJJ.

Infusion has performed in too many countries to list, and at music festivals such as Coachella, Creamfields, Glastonbury, Roskilde, The Miami Winter Music Conference, The Big Day Out, Parklife and Stereosonic.
