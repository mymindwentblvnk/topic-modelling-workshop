Catharist formed in St Andrews, Scotland in 2006. The members had played together in various other local bands over the years and decided to form a new band which would showcase all their interests, not just musically but through the lyrics as well. In 2008, after relentlessly gigging for two years, the band went on hiatus after guitarist, James Foote moved back to England. The remaining members went on to play in various other bands, but In 2011 they decided it was time to re-form Catharist as they did not like the way things ended so abruptly. Since then they have spent months tirelessly working on their debut album "When Ancient Gods Return". The album is a concept piece which is faster and heavier than anything previously produced by the band. Catharist entered the studio on Oct 31st 2011 working along side Valvetone Productions. The Album was released March 29th 2012. They are expected to enter studio in late 2013 to record their second album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Catharist">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
