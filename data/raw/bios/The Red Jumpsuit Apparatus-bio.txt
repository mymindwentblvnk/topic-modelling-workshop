The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus is an alternative rock/post-hardcore band that was originally formed in 2003 in Middleburg, Florida, about 30 miles south west of Jacksonville. The current members of the band are Ronnie Winter, the lead vocalist, Joey Westwood, bassist, Josh Burke, guitarist,  & Jon Wilkes, drummer, all of whom do back-up vocals. 

Art often thrives in the aftermath of adversity, and since we last heard from Red Jumpsuit Apparatus, there have been plenty of variables that the five-piece alternative rock act had to endure. But for the Middleburg, Florida-based band, hardships eventually ironed out thanks to unrelenting perseverance, paving the way for the band’s incredibly ambitious (and aptly titled) The Hell Or High Water EP, release August 24th, 2010.

The self-released project comes on the heels of the band’s voluntary parting of ways with Virgin Records, the company that first signed the band for 2006’s gold selling Don’t You Fake It (spawning the smash single “Face Down”), followed by 2009’s Lonely Road (which debuted in the top twenty of the Billboard 200), but eventually became more of an albatross than an anchor for the burgeoning band. 

According to the Reap Song facts, the first single from The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus' third studio album, Am I the Enemy?, "Reap", was released via YouTube on March 24 2011, then for download a month later on April 26, 2011. The whole album was released on August 29, 2011.
