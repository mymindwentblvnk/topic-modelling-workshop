At least four artists share the name Maar:

1) Duo of Michael Vallera and Joseph Clayton Mills. Warped atmospherics of dub and the severity of minimalist composition, translucent drones and traces of field recordings, deployed to create shifting degrees of focus, while flickering electronics are pieced together in a disorienting mosaic. In addition to a cassette tape on Entr'acte, their releases include two albums on Umor Rex — Ceto in 2009 and Absolute Delay in 2016.

2) A Norwegian folk trio founded in 2013.  All three women are well-respected musicians who have been in previous popular Scandinavian modern folk bands.
Britt Pernille Frøholm - fiddle and hardanger fiddle
Irene Tillung - accordion
Ellen Brekken - double bass

3) An instrumental rock band from Worcester, MA.
Chris Knight - Lead Guitar
Keith Tuttle - Guitars
Dan Wenners - Bass
Mike Guercio - Drums 

4) A musician who can be found under Māra Upmane-Holšteina. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Maar">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
