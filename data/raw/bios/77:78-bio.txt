77:78 are Aaron Fletcher and Tim Parkin, both members of the musical kaleidoscope that is The Bees (known as A Band Of Bees in North America), from the English Isle of Wight.

"Crate diggers and music nuts to the man, 77:78’s music possesses snatches of the fried, post-sandbox loveliness of The Beach Boys Smiley Smile, the clatter of King Tubby’s junkyard dub, the childlike playfulness of early Syd Barret and a gentle seabreeze of sublime West Coast harmonies and like The Bees, their almost-in-the-can debut album already sounds like staying up with a mate who has a mind-blowing record collection playing you all the best bits." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/77:78">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
