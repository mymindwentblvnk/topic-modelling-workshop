A regular face on the house and bass scene since his debut track ‘First Time’ in spring 2015, Taim’s rough-but-restrained balance of soul, energy, groove and grit goes from strength to strength with an impressive discography on heavy weight labels, radio stations and channels such as Confession, Columbia, Get Twisted, Punks, Saucy, Radio 1xtra and UKF. 
 
A permanent resident in playlists of DJs like My Nu Leng, Chris Lorenzo, Shift K3Y, Malaa and Tchami, Taim is ready to unleash a wealth of music for 2019, starting with a new single on Saucy Records, a new EP on Confession and a brand new remix for Flux Pavilion.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/TAIM">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
