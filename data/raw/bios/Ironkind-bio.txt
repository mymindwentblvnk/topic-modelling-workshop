IronKind (Mk1) started out in Denver, Colorado in 2000 as a Heavy Rock group trying to propagate the underground Doom/Stonerrock scene in Western United States. Comprised of members from Denvers "Grind Masters" Catheter (Jeff Montoya, Heraldo Mardones and Kieth Sanches), Conan Hultgren from Game-Two records and Anthony Comulada from (Maryland) Outside Truth. IronKind release a self-produced demo in '01 with 4 songs. Played many shows in Denver and also managed to pull off a small tour to the S.H.O.D. Fest in Dallas with Oversoul. Anthony

IK (Mk2) Consisted of a Bass player change (Wally), to keep commitments at that time, and release a 7" Split with VooDoo Shock from Conans' Game Two Records in 2003. Due to Anthony having to put music on hiatus and leave IronKind to pursue life in general back on the East-Coast. And the loss of Kieth Sanches on Guitar. Which turned IK into a 4 piece. Anthony is currently carrying the torch (Mk3) on the East-Coast trying to keep IronKind from falling away into obscurity.
