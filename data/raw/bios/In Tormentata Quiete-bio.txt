In Tormentata Quiete is an Extreme Symphonic Metal band from Bologna (Italy). Everything began in 1998 from a common idea of Antonio (keyboards) and Lorenzo (guitar) with the will to create an innovative genre of metal music that could assemble the melody and passion of Italian folk music and the power of extreme metal music. The concept of ‘I Tre Attimi Del Silenzio’ borns simply from a piano and an acustic guitar. Later on they get in touch with Francesco (drums) and in the metal panorama of Bologna In Tormentata Quiete was born. Marco (voice) joined he project giving the voice to the music melodies already created and infuse into the songs the theatricality, making the sound unique. The four musicians decided to add a melodic and powerful voice far away from the exteme metal scene, so Gianni is called to play this part. In tormentata Quiete decided to enter ‘Fear Studio’ in Alfonsine (RA) where ‘I Tre Attimi Del Silenzio’ born; Acustic ‘battente’ guitar (typical of south Italy) linked to pastern melody and kicking metal riffs gave the Promo an unique sound and the band got very positive reviews from all Metal Magazine and E-Zine! Lately with Riccardo as second guitar and Matteo as bass (replaced now by Maurizio), ITQ project was completed beginning to play gigs around Italy and at the same time creating new stuff for the next forthcoming album 'In Tormentata Quiete ’. Delicate melodies and mighty distortion sound is the principle on which ITQ has his roots trying to give people simply great emotions. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/In+Tormentata+Quiete">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
