Astrophobos was formed in 2009, and the music is mostly inspired by the Swedish and Norwegian black metal and death metal scene of the nineties.

October 2010 saw the release of the bands first recording, the self-financed EP Arcane Secrets. The EP - recorded in June 2010 in Version Studio by Erik Nilsson (Aoria, A Swarm of the Sun) - received great response from the scene and very favourable reviews.

The bands debut full-length "Remnants of Forgotten Horrors" was released January 24th 2014 by Triumvirate Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Astrophobos">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
