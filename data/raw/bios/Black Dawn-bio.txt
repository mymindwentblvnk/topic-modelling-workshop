BLACK DAWN (Formerly known as Nocturnal Feast)

It all started in 1993 (finland). Cauldron, Wrath, Tero, Marko, Jussi changed the name Nocturnal Feast into Black Dawn. Before the recording of the 2nd demo in May, Black Dawn was in war with the local mob of Jehovah worshippers the police and one particular priest. In the first quarter of the year the Black Dawn fell to pieces once more. Only Wrath and Cauldro, were left. The old way became their goal once more. Before the summer Black Dawn found new members : Anzhaar and Gaunt. 

Black Dawn is also know as the True Black Dawn due to legal issues with another band from the US with the same name.
