Mnich are an (extremely underrated) progressive/technical death metal band from Czech Republic that formed in 1990. Since forming, they have only released 3 full-length albums, 'Přivítej smrt' in 1994, 'Impervious Gates of Heaven' in 1997 and 'Nine Shapes of Death' in 2007. Their sound is highly comparable to Death's later albums, as well as some bands that formed after them; (the Canadian)Quo Vadis, Illogicist and Incarnator to name a few. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mnich">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
