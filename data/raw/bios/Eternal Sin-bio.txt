Eternal Sin played since 1999, autumn. 

For this time in group there was a change of drummers and a bass-guitarist. Plus on a permanent job is taken the second guitarist. The basic style -- blasphemous black/death metal. Though, by a material for 3-rd album, someone will tell differently. 

Participants of collective do not rank themselves as satanists, however the word blasphemy and connected with it a red string verbs and nouns is not alien to them. 

For today Eternal Sin has written down debut `Christ's False Torments` (2003), let out in format MC on Oupiric Productions and CD on Wroth Emitter Prod. Work above data of second album `Hatred To Religion` which is executed in crude black/death style, and also a new material proceeds.

Releases: CD (100 copy) -- ESProduction (self, 2003); MC (1000 copy) -- OUPIRIC Productions (2004); CD (666 copy) -- Wroth Emitter (2005). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Eternal+Sin">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
