Formed in 2006, based in Co. Fermanagh, Northern Ireland playing with bands such as Municipal Waste, Unleashed, Gama Bomb, SSS and more, having played/ toured all over Ireland, across the sea to England and Scotland. Our debut EP 'V For Visceral' was released in 2008, and unofficially released our first full length album 'Quick and Severe' in 2010.

Faced with line-up changes in 2011 we recruited Omer Jamil on bass, and Chris McCabe (Absolutist) on vocals. Now with a complete line-up the aim is to get 'Quick and Severe' officially put out following extensive gigs, touring, and are already in the writing process for a second album.

At the start of 2012 we signed with Punkerama Records to release "Quick & Severe" officially on the 4th of April in Belfast, Ireland.
