Gone is the name of more than one artist:
1) instrumental rock band
2) Swedish rock band
3) Spanish MC
4) American Sludge band

1) Formed near the end of his tenure as the leader of Los Angeles hardcore legends Black Flag, Greg Ginn's instrumental group Gone walked the strange fine line between atonal jazz, riff-heavy rock and brief forays into funk stylings sporadically from 1986 onwards. The first Gone release, Let's Get Real, Real Gone For a Change, and its follow up, Gone II -- But Never Too Gone featured eventual Rollins Band members Sim Cain (drums) and Andrew Weiss (bass). Gone went quiet after their first two releases, not to return until 1994 with not one but two new full lengths released that year, Criminal Mind and All the Dirt That's Fit to Print. With Cain and Weiss no longer playing with Ginn (Weiss, by this time, had moved on from Rollins Band, and taken up bass duties with Ween), replacements were found with bassist Steve Sharp and drummer Gregory Moore. 1996 and 1998 saw further Gone releases, Best Left Unsaid and Country Dumb, respectively. Other projects, as well as distribution problems at Ginn's (and for that matter Gone's) label, SST, kept Gone quiet after 1998, limiting the band to occasional live appearances.

4) Sludge/doom metal from Long Beach, California, United States
