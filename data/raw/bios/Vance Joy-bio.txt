Vance Joy (born James Keogh in Melbourne) is an Australian singer-songwriter. His debut EP God Loves You When You're Dancing was released in March 2013. The single "Riptide" became a success on Australian commercial radio and was certified Platinum by the Australian Record Industry Association (ARIA). It was followed up by Dream Your Life Away, his first full-length album, in 2014, featuring the 2 singles from "God Loves You When Your Dancing" alongside many new songs, which went number 1 in Australia and number 2 in Canada, as well as charting in many other countries, eventually being certified a total of 6 times platinum.

Feeding on a diet of The Pogues, Paul Kelly, and whatever else was playing, Joy cut his teeth performing at open mic nights in Melbourne. His style is folk music with pop influences. His songs capture the familiar pulse of everyday experiences in a unique and celebratory manner.  His lyrics reach out to you and hold on for a moment. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vance+Joy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
