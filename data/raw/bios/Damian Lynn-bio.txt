May we introduce: Damian Lynn, singer-songwriter from Lucerne. You could label him a newcomer, but he's come around a lot already. He played on over 60 stages in 2014, playing solo-gigs as well as support slots for Büne Huber, Pegasus or Bligg. On 26th June 2015 he released his debut record on Phonag Records AG, which went straight to #12 in the Swiss Album Charts.

After playing in several bands Damian took is career in his own hands some years ago. He started writing songs, recorded them and uploaded live performances on Youtube. Word of his talent spread quickly and Damian was able to play his first gigs, equipped only with his guitar, voice and loop station. Until today he sticks to this way of performing, although he's recently added a live drummer to his shows. In the list of concerts played there's already renowned places like Gurtenfestival, m4music Festival or the Montreux Jazz Café in London.

The Singer-Songwriter has grown his fanbase during his support shows for the swiss soul star Stefanie Heinzmann, where he played lots of shows in Germany. His biggest success so far just followed right after this tour in January 2016: Damian Lynn was nominated for the "Best Talent" award at the yearly Swiss Music Awards - and he won! By winning this price he has shown once more how big his talent is.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Damian+Lynn">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
