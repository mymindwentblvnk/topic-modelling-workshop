The name Atlantic may refer to four different bands:

1) A five-piece rock band from Melbourne, Australia. Members are James Bos (guitar & vocals), Dave Dullens (guitar & vocals), Ben Fielder (vocals & guitar), Vin Sadhai (drums), and Matt Whittle (bass).
ATLANTIC came together in the early part of 2009 as an off-the-cuff project for current and past members of Sunset Suicides, El Mark, nancythompson and The Glasses. Jumping into a rehearsal space to see what could happen, over the span of a few months the group of five busted out a bunch of songs that they were surprisingly proud of. These tracks perfectly represent how naturally the songwriting came about for the group, as well as the band's unique meshing of various rock, pop, prog and punk sounds garnered from a wide range of influences.
After an onslaught of shows over twelve months, James Bos departed from the band, and five became four. This is where it's currently at. 

2) AOR band from the United Kingdom.
