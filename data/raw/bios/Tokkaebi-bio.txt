Tokkaebi is a Korean metal band formed in 1997, Seoul. They have been active in korean underground music industry. They have released the first full-length studio album, 'Astronomical Phenomena(korean 천문, hanja 天文) in 2000. They happen to be consistantly active so far, now working on their second album.

 One of the remarkable features of this band is that vocal is totally uncomprehensible, not in  a way that the vocal is so harsh, but in a way that they actually do not have lyrics. It is said that the lyrics are actually improvisation of Dok-go-su-a(vocals). According to the band's official website(http://cafe.daum.ne/tokkaebi)(Korean), the lyrics are ancient incantations that were used to curse enemy and tell the fortunes. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tokkaebi">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
