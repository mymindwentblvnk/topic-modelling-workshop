Sins In Vain was created in Helsingborg, Sweden in the fall of 2005 as the singer Linnéa Renholm's final school project. The idea was initially to write a few songs and then record them. She first turned to her dear friend Christian Andersen for some help and advice. Christian had a few ideas and together they soon had written the first song of the project. Christian wrote the music and Linnéa wrote the lyrics and arranged the vocal part. Christian had been playing in a metal band for some years at the time and this could be heard in the music he wrote.

A few months passed and some more songs came to life. Linnéa and Christian started to feel they had something going, the songs sounded well. So they wanted to form a band and asked the drummer Fredrik Löfgren and the bass player Johan Nilsson if they wanted to join. The project had now developed into more of a band project than just song writing and recording.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sins+in+Vain">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
