Body of Christ formed in 1992, playing a kind of technical Death Metal that's in a class of its own. The line-up at that time looked like this: Franky Hendrikx (guitar/vocals), Werner Steenhaut (guitar), Luc Croughs (drums), Bart Graulus (bass).

After Bart’s departure, Body of Christ underwent quite a few line-up changes, until finally Jacques Putseys was recruited as synthesizer player and Franky switched to bass. This line-up recorded the "Soul Struggle"-demo in the Beaufort studio, Bovenkarspel, at the end of ‘94.
Half-way 1996, the band split up due to motivational problems.
About two years later, Luc and Franky revived the band.
Troubled once more by many line-up changes, stability was finally reached somewhere in 2004, with two new guitarists: Frank Hermans and Bert Vanherf.

The more than overdue successor to their first demo, a self-financed mini-CD entitled "The Schizophrenic Approach", was released in June 2005.

A new song, "Pearls Before Swine", has been posted on their MySpace: http://www.myspace.com/body0fchrist
