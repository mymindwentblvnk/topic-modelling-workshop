FaltyDL is Drew Lustman outta New York City. He's making garage 'n stuff with his hands. Nostalgic tracks immersed in the old New York and Chicago sound yet creating a more subtle futuristic Big Apple version mashing together influences from hip hop, dubstep, garage, soul, jungle and electronica creating his own NYG. NYG. NYG.
