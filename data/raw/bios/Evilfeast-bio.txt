In 1996, GrimSpirit decided to create his own one-man black metal band and so Evilfeast was born. His music can be described as atmospheric black metal that includes many dark, ominous and other times   melancholic ambient passages and undertones. Grimspirit also runs his own label called Funeral Sound Productions.
