Produced by Murat Mathew Erdem who has worked extensivly with international pop icon Tarkan and also Ayça Z. Aydın (a.k.a MIYA). All the lyrics and music were written by Ayça Z. Aydın. Murat Mathew Erdem arranged 9 of the songs while “Büyüme” was arranged by Gürsel Çelik. Murat Mathew Erdem also did the mixing and mastering of the entire album. The booklet is illustrated by Ergün Gündüz. The sound of the album is generally a mixture of Pop, Elektronica, Alternative Rock, Trip - Hop, Chill-out, with touch of blues.

MiYA’s lyrics generally contain social issues. In that respect MiYA – Uzaklaşmalıyım, is a concept album which questions the world we live in and in general also is a search for something more positive, good, beautiful and fair.
MiYA believes that it is within the individual artists power to influence the chaos and culture of ever more present issues such as social, humane and musical values. With this album, MiYA defines these values.
MiYA believe that a mixture of words, melodies and the right sounds are the most potent and harmless means of communication. MIYA believes that with caring, love and music we can make the world a better place.
