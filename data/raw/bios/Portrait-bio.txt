The band has a very energetic sound. Tough but not too tough. Emotional but not too emotional. Agressive but not too... Great combination of guitar work with viola. This band has it all. From sweet melodic parts too Rough hardcore driven tunes. Portrait’s influences were such bands as inkwell, frail and Indian summer.
