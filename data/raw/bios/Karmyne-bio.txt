Karmyne was formed in September 2005 from the remnants of melodeath project Cenotaph. Anthony Ridout and Doug Anderson, bassist and drummer respectively, left with the intention of creating an epic melodic death metal band, taking a heavy influence from the Gothenburg scene. 

Lyricist and vocalist Alex Fawcett of Hagakure became a permanent member in November 2005

Karmyne's first demo was recently recorded at PMCG with session guitar playing provided by friend of the band Damian Breeze. Soon after recording was finished, Ben Ellis and Josh McMorran joined the band on guitars after proving themselves more than worthy in audition. 

As of recently the band is on undeterminded hiatus due to other projects amongst which include Bloodshot Dawn and Oceanus. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Karmyne">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
