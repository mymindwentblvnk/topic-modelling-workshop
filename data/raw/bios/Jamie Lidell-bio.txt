Jamie Lidell (born September 18, 1973, Huntingdon, England) is a musician and soul singer, signed to Warp.

Famed for his largely improvised shows, that see Jamie constructing his tracks live, voicing and layering right in front of your eyes, effortlessly whipping them out of the air and forging them into clanking electro riffs and deathprod funk grooves.

Likened to Sly Stone, Prince and Little Richard, he is Britain's voice of soul for the new era.

Jamie is/was half of the Super_collider project. He has also helped write and produce on the albums of Mocky, who in return drums in his live band.
