It was year 2000, when three 10-year old kids from Hamina, Finland, decided to set up a rockband.
During the first couple of years those three kids, known as Niko Suortti, Tatu Mellin and Ville Nummi
spent their time by playing HIM-covers. 

Few years after foundation, they asked their old pal Riku Lipponen
to join them in the band. Not long after they decided to name themselves as Cry of Pain and start
making songs for their first demo.

To date, Cry of Pain has recorded four demos (Evil Inside 2004,
The Beginning of the End 2005, The Melancholic Massacre 2006, This Hell Inside Your Head 2008), one single
(Dead Rockstar 2011) and played numerous gigs in various places. After 10 years of rocking, Cry of Pain
is ready to hit the new decade uglier and louder than ever before.

Cry of Pain has a music video of the track: Getaway runner: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkWqGVC-rGQ

Cry of Pain will start recording their debut album in Villvox studio near Lahti, Finland on the end of November 2012. Behind the buttons is Ari "Frank" Laurila (Klamydia, Apulanta, Sara). The album includes ten tracks of booze, rock'n roll and offcourse women. The album comes out in probably on March 2013. Stay tuned for more information!
