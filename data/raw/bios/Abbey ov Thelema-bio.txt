Abbey ov Thelema was founded in the beginning of summer of 2009 as a dark ambient one-man side project of Delgrast, who was already active in another black metal band, Nevaloth.

Two demos were released among close friends, "Abbey ov Thelema" (2009) and "Major Arcana" (2010). The first one consists mostly of ambient songs originally written for Nevaloth, the second one is a conceptual work focused on the tarot's 22 most powerful cards, known as Major Arcana.

After that the ambient style of the project has changed dramatically. Vilozof from Nevaloth joined the Abbey on guitar, and the new material can be described as a sort of an avant-garde, experimental and atmospheric black metal. The debut album, "A Fragment ov the Great Work", was released in October 2011 via Sonic Temple Records.

In 2012, another change takes place. Vilozof leaves the Abbey and Delgrast with a new studio line-up records a demo and a full-lenght album. The demo, released in August, is called "Prelude to Apocalypse" and is used as a promo to find a label which would release the upcoming second album.

Since the "Prelude to Apocalypse" demo, Abbey ov Thelema labels their music as "Transcendental Khaoblack Metal".

The band is named after a small house in Sicily, which was in the years 1920-1923 used as an occult centrum founded by Aleister Crowley and Leah Hirsing.

Abbey ov Thelema is not, never was and never will be a political band. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Abbey+ov+Thelema">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
