Scotland's exponents of 'Blood Metal' Achren's brand of metal is crushingly heavy and uncompromising. Filled with raw and razor sharp riffs, death metal growls, black metal screams, and pounding drums they create a unique and commandeering sound which over the course of their first two demos and subsequent releases have forged the term 'Blood Metal.'

Since the line-up solidified in 2009 they built a reputation as one of the most sought after and feared bands in the UK and in 2011 played Metalcamp Festival in Slovenia and Wacken Festival in Germany.  They released their debut full length 'The Forgotten King' at Bloodstock Festival 2011 in the UK. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Achren">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
