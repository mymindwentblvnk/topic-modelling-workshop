Formed in October 2001, Colchester's One Louder has risen from rather modest beginnings, as a means to combat the boredom of everyday life, and has since grown into a musical monster, consuming the lives of all those involved in making it what it is today.

Since the start, the influences have been drawn from a plethora of bands and musical styles but have always remained focused on the heavier guitar-lead side of things. Recently rebuilt with a new line-up, One Louder are ready to re-enter the live music scene and have released their new album entitled 'Comin' Home'.
