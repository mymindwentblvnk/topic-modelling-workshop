Jason Falkner (born June 2, 1968) is an American pop and rock musician. He has performed with several bands, most notably Jellyfish in San Francisco, California, as well as being solo artist.

In 1996, he released the album "Jason Falkner Presents Author Unknown", which was produced, written, and performed almost entirely by Falkner (the only exception being some guitar overdub done by Alain Johannes). Although it received strong critical reviews, it was not a commercial success. During that same year, he wrote several songs on Brendan Benson's album "One Mississippi", and played various instruments on an album released in 1996, by Susanna Hoffs. In 1997, he worked with Eric Matthews on a second album, The Lateness of the Hour, co-producing and assisting on five tracks.

In 1999, Falkner released 'Can You Still Feel?", another album written and performed as an entire solo effort, it was produced with Nigel Godrich. In 2000 Jason was kept very busy, touring and contributing to various projects. He recorded a song for a tribute album, and played backup on Roger Manning and Brian Reitzell's album "Logan's Sanctuary".

In 2007 Jason is credited as performing several instruments on Becks release from that year, "The Information".  It is also rumored that Jason does some limited touring as part of Beck's band.

He released his third album "I'm OK... You're OK" in Japan. In 2009, he released his fourth album "All Quiet On the Noise Floor," again only in Japan. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jason+Falkner">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
