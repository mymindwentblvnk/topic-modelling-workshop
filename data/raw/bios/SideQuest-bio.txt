Sidequest is a new Zack Bissell (Timeless Phase, Legendary Admins) endeavor which serves as an outlet for musical expressions of the multiple sort. Each Sidequest release is a 'sidequest' into personally unexplored regions, with the end result being the beginnings of a potentially greater work. 

Updates to initial releases are all subject to future 'expansion pack' releases over time.

Sidequest 1, Soahperf, has been released in June 2011. Sidequest 2, entitled Koh Tenga, will be released in the summer of 2012.   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sidequest">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
