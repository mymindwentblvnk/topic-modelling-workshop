Atmospheric, yet raw solo American Underground Black Metal dynamically composed with sweeping  orchestral / neo-classic Dark-Ambient passages.  FIRTH OF DAMNATION's melodic atmosphere can be  compared to band's like MJÃ–LNIR (Germany),  VERGELMER, and Sweden's PARNASSUS or OCTINOMOS.

Sole member Ian "Nazgul Vathron" McKinney was killed in the early morning hours of April 6, 2015, as a passenger in a van accident while on tour as a member of the band Wormreich.
