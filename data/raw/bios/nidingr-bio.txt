Nidingr was founded in 1992 in Horten, Norway. They play a harsh mixture of black metal and death metal. While the over-all impression of Nidingr's music is pretty rough and straight-forward, they also manage to incorporate various details, ranging from eerie synths to dissonant leads and occasional piano lines. Most of the lyrics revolve around occult/gnostic topics and are delivered in a growling fashion reminiscent of current Vader material.

After recording two demos in 1996 and 1999, Nidingr debuted with their full-length album Of Sorrow Infinite and Darkness in 2005. In 2006 they released the EP Sodomize the Priest, consisting of re-recorded rehearsals and some new songs.

In 2010 they released a mini-album titled Wolf-Father based on old Norse mythology. Hellhammer, Teloch's band mate from Mayhem did session drumming for the album and the supporting shows. Ulver's vocalist Kristoffer Rygg did additional singing on the track Baldrs draumar. In around 2011 they got their new talented drummer Ã˜yvind Myrvoll from Ski on drums.

In 2012 they started their year with signing to the Norwegian metal label Indie Recordings. Their latest album, Greatest of Decievers hit the streets in November 2012. This album also featured singing from Kristoffer Rygg on the track The Worm is Crowned. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nidingr">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
