Lunar Reign is a self-described "occult war metal" band based out of the Tampa, FL metropolitan area.  The group is founded and managed by Spectral. 

Lunar Reign's first song was written in 1996, titled "Solomon's Key".

It wasn't until late 1997 when additional member "Torrid" was recruited to handle drumming duties.  As a two-piece, the band name "Unlighted" was decided upon, and a 3-song rehearsal demo was recorded.

In 1999 a deal was made with Largactyl Records to release a full-length titled "Pacta Coventa Daemonum."  This recording was never released, due to the label's owner landing in jail on drug charges.

In late 2000, Spectral and Atrophous had split from the band in favor of a drum machine.  Work began on recording another release, the 2001 official EP/demo through Forgotten Wisdom Productions (France).  This EP contained 7 songs and enjoyed good distribution across Europe, helping land Lunar Reign on 2 compilation tapes, "Doomed by the Moonknights" (France) and "Underworld Comp" (Slovakia).

By 2001 the first Lunar Reign video was filmed for the song "Black Pullet", and a line-up change was taking place.  During the reforming period, a promo CD was recorded in 2003, and self-released in 2004, which was mostly redone versions of older songs.  During the 2nd reformation, another video was filmed in 2005 for the song "Ring of Gyges".

After that, the band was reformed again.  At this point, new material was delayed due to the focus on second-band, "Wolfenreich".  Wolfenreich was the work of Spectral and Trigrammaton, and for this project a demo and EP were recorded.

In 2008 Lunar Reign resumed, recording "Magnum Opus".  This recording landed Lunar Reign a deal with Beneath the Fog Productions (Va.) in 2009.
