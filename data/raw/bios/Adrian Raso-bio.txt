Adrian Raso is a native of Guelph, Ontario Canada. He first began playing guitar at the age of 13 when he purchased an acoustic for 7 dollars after spotting one during his paper route that was being sold at a yard sale. He would spend the next years studying guitar with theory books and listening to inspirations such as Prince, gypsie jazz master Django Reinhardt and guitar virtuoso Steve Vai. Many of Raso's albums reflect the gypsie jazz influence, however the album Electric Medusa shows off the heavy instrumental rock influence that Vai has had on his playing. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Adrian+Raso">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
