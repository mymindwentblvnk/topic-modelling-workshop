What makes you think of a frozen adventurer in the nordic woods?

What hides a lone grave?..
Ancient tales that lives in our reality.

A spectral analysis of moonlight, colored by heavy deep distorted
low tuned guitars, surrounded by pulsing drums.
This is a journey from Innsmouth to Transylvania....
