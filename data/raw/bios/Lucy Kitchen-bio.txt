Lucy Kitchen is a Southampton based singer-songwriter, a self-confessed ‘folky bird’ who cites influences from the likes of Joni Mitchell, Mazzy Star, Laura Veirs, Bon Iver, Neil Young and Nick Drake. She crafts delicate and haunting songs intimately sung and backed with lullaby guitars, splashed with flute and glockenspiel.
