Vallon's second release, 'Vices' marks an enormous milestone in their surprisingly short run as a band. The follow up to their debut EP, 'Vices' infects your ears with intricate guitar work, melodic choruses, brutal breakdowns and lyrics that ooze with sincerity. It is a must-have for any metal lover's collection, and it is only the beginning for this young, up-and-coming band.

Hailing from the North Shore area of Massachusetts, Vallon is a heavy-hitting metal band fresh out of Zing Recording Studio where they recorded their debut EP "For Safe Keeping" with producer Eric Arena (A Day To Remember, Endwell, Farewell To Freeway). Since recording their first release, Vallon has shared the stage with national acts like Avenged Sevenfold, Atreyu, Bullet For My Valentine, It Dies Today and more.

With the support of voting fans and friends, Vallon has won the Ernie Ball Battle Of The Bands twice, earning them spots on the 2007 Vans Warped Tour and the 2008 Rockstar Taste Of Chaos Tour.

Vallon plans to segway into a constant touring schedule so they can continue to spread their name and meet new fans and friends across the country. Be sure to keep your eye on this band, and make sure you come out and support when they roll through your town! It's a live show you wouldn't want to miss. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vallon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
