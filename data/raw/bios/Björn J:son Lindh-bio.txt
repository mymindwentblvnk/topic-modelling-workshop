Björn J:son Lindh was born in Arvika, Värmland, Sweden in October 25 1944. He majored in piano and flute at the Ingesund University College of Music, in Arvika, Sweden. He pursued his musical training at Musikhögskolan, The Royal School of Music, in Stockholm in the mid - late 60's. After his years there he started playing free-form jazz with Nils Sandström, and later also Arabic flute music with Abd El Rahman El Khatib (cf CousCous). 

As was written in the mid 70's (Sohlman): "Björn represents the integrating tendencies within swedish music that start to grow in the early 70's, and consequently in his musical pursuit has been affected by the so called serious musical avant-garde, Indian music, Arabic music, jazz and pop" (rather freeish translation)
One important step was in the collaboration with the swedish guitar hero Janne Schaffer, when they formed the group "Hörselmat" (Earmeal). This construct brought modern Swedish jazz not only to the Swedes, but also to the US. Almost 30 years later, this collaboration still results in wonderful concerts and recordings. Although the pace of their present work moves more into the realms of smooth harmonies and less into technical excellence one rarely makes a mistake in recognising a new tune by either musician.

A vast number of other artists have reached success through the collaboration with Björn. Apart from his participation as a terrific flautist and keyboardist, he has arranged and produced tracks and records for many performers in the past and present musical elite, including : Hawkey Franzén, Lill Lindfors, Lee Ritenour, Ted Gärdestad, ABBA, Ulvaeus & Andersson, Cornelis Vreeswijk, Monica Törnell, Mike Oldfield.
