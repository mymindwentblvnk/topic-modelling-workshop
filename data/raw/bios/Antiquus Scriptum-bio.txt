Black metal band from Almada, Portugal.

Started with several members in 1998, eventually turned into an one-member project based on Sacerdos Magus. Lyrical themes deal with bygone time, medieval times and ancient history.

Sacerdos Magus uses session members for studio performance and doesn't play live.

The band was, somehow , allegedly called as a Christian band due to the cross on the band logo which is, in fact, a Templar cross that symbolizes Portugal's roots with Templar Knights.

The band has released three full lengths and severeal demos so far.

In Pulverem Reverteris (2000) [Demo]
Abi In Malam Pestem (2002)
