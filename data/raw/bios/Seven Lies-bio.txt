Seven Lies over the past eight years has built a following in the club and rock scene of Vancouver with their unique electronic rock sound. Seven Lies captures the energy of new wave without treading the waters of nostalgia and blends it with melodic electronica to recreate an emotional edge reminiscent of the 80’s. Dave Bowman (formerly of Soul Decision) leads the band with his powerful vocals and melodic hooks, along with Jackson on Keyboards, Sean Nisbet-Jones on Guitar and Dan Esterreicher on Bass.

The third album from Seven Lies continues their evolution and includes a more electronic dance sound. Their new album “Devoted” is full of rhythm drenched dance tunes like “Follow You” “Devoted” and “Play That Music Loud”, some stylistic moody electronica like “Come Down” and “Bang Bang” and well written ballads like “Make Up Time” and You’re So Beautiful” that can really sweep you up into refection. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Seven+Lies">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
