Ambassador Gun (formerly known as A Second From The Surface) was formed in the late 90’s by Luke Olson and Tim Sieler and played as a three piece grindcore band in Minneapolis. Their most recent album, When In Hell, was released in 2008 by Lost Archives Records. 

Their last album as A Second From the Surface, “The Streets Have Eyes”, was released internationally by This Dark Reign Recordings on May 8th, 2007. The album sought to expose the tyrannized human spirit amidst paranoia, frustration, money, greed and desire. 

 Since the beginning, they have embarked on the ultimate goal to write distinct songs, tour, and gain recognition the world over as an important band. They have shared the stage with such artists as Otep, Red Sparowes, Harlots, Today Is The Day and many others. They will continue to write and grind that shit indefinitely.
