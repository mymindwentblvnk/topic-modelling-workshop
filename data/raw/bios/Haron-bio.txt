Somewhere in 1994 Sabrax began his solo project named HARON. The first opus "Haron" were found release in 1994. Proposing two very long songs became a cult in the underground scene where rules the unbelievable and perverse atmosphere which succeed in drawing cold and obscure landscapes. The second HARON album came out in the middle of 1995 which is called "Northland Hordes Storms of Evil". Shortly after Sabrax recorded his most famous album “Hymni Imperii Sathanas”. His music annihilates in true meaning of the word. The fourth HARON release "Triumphus Regni Obscuri"came out in 1997 and was a great example of cursed and symphonic music. The fifth and the last HARON opus “Intellectii Macrocosmica” creates surely new damned ways and enchanted a lot of solitary souls eternally shrouded in the Darkness. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Haron">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
