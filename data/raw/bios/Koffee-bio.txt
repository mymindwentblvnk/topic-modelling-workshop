Mikayla Victoria Simpson (born 16 February 2000), better known as Koffee, is a Jamaican deejay/rapper, singer, and guitarist from Spanish Town, Jamaica. 

In 2017 she released her first single, "Legend", with just her vocals and acoustic guitar. A tribute to Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt, the song became a viral Instagram hit. Awareness of the violence and social problems she witnessed growing up has influenced her lyrics, and besides Protoje and Chronixx she has cited Super Cat and Giggs among her musical inspirations. She released five singles before signing with Columbia Records UK. Her December 2018 single "Raggamuffin" called out gun violence and governmental neglect of the youth. Koffee's debut EP, Rapture, was released on the label on March 14, 2019. The video for single "Throne", which debuted on The Fader on 22 January 2019, takes viewers on a tour through her hometown of Spanish Town. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Koffee">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
