Formed back in 2008 (Jaipur,India), none of the members had an idea about what exact sound we wanted. The band started with the name “Alath” playing Death-Thrash covers. A few changes in the Line-up led us to another opening, pure death metal covering bands like Celtic Frost, Obituary, Six Feet Under etc. The phase and Band we named “War Autopsy”. Later by the mid of 2010 summers, the band were a bit more comple
x and experimented progressive music covering bands like Opeth, Death etc. The idea about their sound was a bit out of oblivion as each member was more into same sound. This was the Genesis of Winter Gate.

Winter Gate, experiments with their influences. Progressive by nature, we try to put variety of influences in a song and hence avoid being contained in a genre. Driven by Death Metal, pushed by 70’s sound and held by Progressive Rock is what it makes Winter Gate, what they sound.
