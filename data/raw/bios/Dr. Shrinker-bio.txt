Formed in 1987 and based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Dr. Shrinker was, for the most part, an obscure death metal group, only coming to wider attention with the release of a posthumous split EP with Nunslaughter and a discography CD, released in 2004 by Necroharmonic Productions. Three of the group's members (Tony Brandt, Scott McKillop, Matt Grassberger) would also played in Phantasm (US), a group in some ways similar to Dr. Shrinker, and released their debut album "The Abominable". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dr.+Shrinker">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
