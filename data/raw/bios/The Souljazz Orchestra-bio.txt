When a band is called The Souljazz Orchestra, there is a certain expectation to uphold that name and to provide a sound that accompanies such a title; this band accomplishes just that and more. Hailing from Ottawa, The Souljazz Orchestra combine jazz, funk, African and Latin music while touching on politics and spirituality. Think - James Brown meets up with Tito Puente and they all hook up to jam at Fela Kuti's house.

Their versatile sound is in part due to the diverse musical backgrounds of the bands individual members: jazz, funk, blues, reggae, classical, and traditional Cuban, Brazilian and West African percussion. The Souljazz Orchestra are known for their captivating live shows and have collaborated with notable artists such as Beautiful Nubia and Mighty Popo and have opened up for Etta James, Sharon Jones & the Dap-Kings, Big Bad Voodoo Daddy and more. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Souljazz+Orchestra">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
