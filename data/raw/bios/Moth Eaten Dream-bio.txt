Formed in Israel on November 2004 by keyboardist Alex (ex-Arafel, Acropolis) and guitarist Guy (Phantom Pain), later on followed by vocalist Nir (Ex - Sitra Achara). These minds chose to present a melancholic, down paced and melodic doom metal. Several months later a 3 song demo was recorded in Alex' home studio. The songs capture the doom metal at it's melodic core, combined with chilling ambient fragments.

Currently the band lowered its gloomy weapons in order to pursue success in previous musical obligations, but the flame is still lit, and for most chances will burn stonger in the future to come. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Moth+Eaten+Dream">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
