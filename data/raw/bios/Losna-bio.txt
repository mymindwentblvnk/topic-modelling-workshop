LOSNA been distilling its bitter sound since 2004. The band spread rage and violence through cutting riffs, crazed Bass, destructive drums and howled vocals! We can say that the sound is a crossover of Thrash Metal, Old School Hard Core and pinches of Death Metal.

With the creative and acid energy of the sisters, be sure, this band is heading for victory!
