2. Apocrypha was founded in 2002. The initial idea was to do something while drinking, but as time went by and better songs were made and the band chose a more serious approach. 
Several gigs followed and the band released it’s first demo, Imminent Damnation, in the beginning of 2004. This disc, totally produced by the band, got very positive response which led to gigs throughout the country (Speakers, Babylon, Elektra, LVC). 

Different opinions on the future of Apocrypha led to the departure of vocalist Gilles early 2005. Soon followed by bassplayer Giel. Manoloxx (ex -unlord, cardinal & consolation) was interested in taking care of the vocals duties, and Jeroen (ex-smogus) took the bass. These changes brought the band to a new level. 

In the beginning of 2007 Apocrypha released their debut album entitled “The Summit of Creation”. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Apocrypha">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
