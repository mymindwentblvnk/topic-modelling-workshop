The band started playing primitive death metal in 1995 and evolutioned to a fast, simple and direct grindcore with short songs and mince-core lyrics (social issues, politics, anti-war, etc.). Their last album "If you mind there's no problem… (2000) is probably its best album and was made and distributed by the straight edge label "Fragment Records" . In this album the band name was changed as a kind of joke to "Xp.rätion". After that they recorded an EP split with Agathocles. In 2002 they decided disbanded and some members founded "Looking for an Answer".
