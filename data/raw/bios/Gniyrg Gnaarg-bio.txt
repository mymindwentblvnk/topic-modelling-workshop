Finnish 'Dungeon' metal trio from Helsinki.

The idea of creating a stoner/doom band was sprung up in the minds of native Helsinkians Tommy and Leo in the early summer of 2008, probably at one of the many bars in Kallio, Helsinki. The band remained a brainchild of the two bassists (one of which had never touched a bass in his life) for over a year, until one night in early september 2009 when we found out that In√©s, a Kallio-based spaniard, wanted an excuse to reincarnate the drummer inside of her. A band was born.
