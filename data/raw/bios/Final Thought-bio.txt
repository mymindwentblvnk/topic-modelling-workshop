At first glance, there’s a lot that could leave you to believe Final Thought are like every other band trying to crack the code in the music industry hailing from the suburbs. But does every other band of fresh faced high school graduates get rotation on major radio stations like Rock 95 without a debut album even released yet? Does every other band open for the likes of Silverstein, Boys Night Out, Ten Second Epic, Social Code, and Shotgun Rules after being together for two years and being the average age of 18? You see, Final Thought is really not like other bands after all. In fact, they are quite different.

Front man Dustin Dopsa, often swarmed by a sea of girls at shows, started Final Thought in 2006 and soon began writing all their songs himself and stamping them with his brand of unique melodic pop-punk. The band comprised of drummer Zach Watson and bassist Brandon Hawthorne, soon started to build a loyal following in their hometown of Barrie, Ontario for their extremely energetic live performances and catchy-as-heck tunes. Promoters, radio DJs, and a slew of wide-eyed kids took notice. 

Now halfway into 2008, the band feels ready to step it up. With the help of a new member added on as the second guitarist, Barrie music scene staple Emmett Morris, Dopsa has found within him some of the most potent songs raging with anthem-sized hooks and choruses. Hear the first infectious single from the forthcoming debut EP, “Hand of Cards” and you’ll be begging for more. These songs are a huge step away from the first incarnation of Final Thought that you heard playing to packed venues in ’06. More refined and confident with their sound, the boys plan to go big this summer and break out of their sometimes-constraining hometown. Things can only go up from here.
