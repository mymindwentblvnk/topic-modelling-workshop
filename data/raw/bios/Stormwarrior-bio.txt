Stormwarrior is a German power metal band that was formed in 1998 by vocalist and guitar player Lars Ramcke and drummer Andre Schumann, adding later in the same year guitarist Scott Bolter and bass player Tim Zienert.[1](p420) The members of Stormwarrior draw their musical influences from the 80's heavy metal scene including such fellow German bands as Helloween and Running Wiild. Stormwarrior were able to lay down their first songs to tape in 1999. Until 2002 two other tapes followed and in the same year they released their first and selfentitled album "StormWarrior", produced by Kai Hansen. 2003 they sold a smaller album named "Heavy Metal fire" including 7 tracks and 2004 the album "Northern Rage" followed. After having a lot of gigs in the year 2005, Stormwarrior moved into an own studio called "Thunderhall Studios", where their Live-Album "At foreign Shores" was produced. It was released in 2006 

At the early 2008 their third album "Heading Northe" stormed the metal scene, which came up with a less fierce but even more melodic style. Another live release from the Wacken Open Air 2007 is expected to come out soon.
