As the dust of centuries has settled on pages unwritten, the gates are opened only within.
In ascension rites of introvert spirits, the signature of passing flesh is inscribed in the memorial garden as a note of entrance. Succeeding this initiation, all levels are accessible through death transpired as severance of the flesh and the spirit immortal.

As the remnants of flesh dance to the endless pulses of the multiverse, the underlying directives in biorhythms to which these pulses are synchronised (from ego to the universe on the left hand and no ego in the void beneath the veil) are to be followed like a call of nature. Nature withholds the void that exists to the unaided eye of the celestials, and the rhythms transpire as keys.

As the innerspace traveler is aligned with the order of the nine, disarray in the processes is suddenly reversible, and the liberated shall walk the brightened path that is not treaded afoot.

"I exhaled and the skies cleared, revealing the stars. And then, from a distant event horizon arose the black sun. Rays of black light illuminated pyramid structures in the desert, as I watched hovering above. Carved in the monolithic stones were alien symbols that became decrypted before my eyes. And the I became the eye, the self dissolved in the light.

Sun worshippers emerged from the sands shifting in the solar wind that carried their voice."
