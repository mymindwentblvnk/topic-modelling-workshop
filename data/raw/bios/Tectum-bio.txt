death-doom metal | dark metal from Cherkassy, Ukraine.

Current line-up:

Napalmer - vocals/tenor saxophone ;
Sniper - bass ;
WallDemar - guitar,synth;
Mucky Pup - drumms.

In 2006 they started probably the first gothic metal band in Cherkassy. At the beginning there were Vladimir (WallDemar, guitar) and brothers: Dmitry (Sniper, bass) and Anton (Mucky Pup, drums). The following development brought 2 new members in 2008: Igor (Soul, guitar) and Alexey (Napalmer, vocals). And in the beginning of 2009 the band has finally decided on its name - Tectum. Tectum, a simple Latin word, might even have Ancient Greek roots, has a row of synonyms - «shelter», «asylum», «cover», «dwelling», «residence», «roof», etc. The name, that was never used in music before, succesfully got accustomed in many corporations and companies all over the world as it implies stability and confidence. Accordingly, we introduce the understanding of „tectum” as an eternal wait, leaving and coming back, private world of each person, loyalty to traditions and respect, moral values, etc.

Over time the band started to get heavier and lower its sound , and at present the style is the most correctly to be defined as a mix of gothic metal / dark metal /death-doom. The biggest influence on Tectums music was made by old monsters Paradise Lost, Crematory, Godgory, Novembers Doom, Agalloch. The music contains clean vocals distinctive in Paradise Lost, My Dying Bride, Tiamat and the growl, typical for death-doom. The band is trying not to put itself into the borders of a certain style and is experimenting with its sound and pace of play. Lyrics are mostly in English, raising questions of life and death, misery and hopelessness, melancholy and loneliness, love and sorrow, mystery and enigma, light and darkness, and a lot of other things as well. 

Recording of debut demo Alpha (2009) and its compilation took place during May-June,2009 in Cherkassy in the home studio of Konstantin Ratnikov - Anvil Records. Debut material became a qualitatively complied product, worth to be familiarized with and downloaded in the Internet for free. Evgenia Pomogaibo helped us with the cover design.

In october 2013 Tectum had released their first full length album "Path to Eternity". Since 2013 Tectum uses in live concert shows tenor saxophone. Now the band is preparing their new material for next album
