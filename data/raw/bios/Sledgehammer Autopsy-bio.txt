Sledgehammer Autopsy started as a brutal death/grindcore band in Denver, Colorado in the year 2007. It was formed by bassist Matt Dorr and vocalist/guitarist Andrew Sares. They released one demo, entitled Mortician's Apprentice. It was 7 tracks in length, containing brutal death metal, 80's influenced death metal, and some grindcore. In 2008/2009, the band became very influenced by early Swedish death metal, and changed their style to fit that format.

Sledgehammer Autopsy has gone through several drummers, vocalists, and guitarists, but the lineup has firmly remained Matt Dorr and Andrew Sares. Currently, they're keeping the project going over the net since the two members live in two different places now.

A new release is planned for 2010, entitled The Art of Bludgeoning. It's a take on 80's Swedish Death metal as well as their own stylistic features. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sledgehammer+Autopsy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
