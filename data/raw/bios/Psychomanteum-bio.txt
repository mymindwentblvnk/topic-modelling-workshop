Psychomanteum was an ambient music collective, brought into existence by two beings Robert C. Kozletsky & Jacob M. Detelich in rural western Pennsylvania.  Their music reflects a cosmic spirituality and within their sound consists of dark ambient drones melded with melancholic and sometimes dreadful atmospheres.

Their debut album Oneironaut was released on April 15th 2011 through Cyclic Law Recordings. Psychomanteum was later dissolved, and Robert C. Kozletsky continued alone to form another project called Apocryphos, which released its debut album "The Prisoners Cinema" on Cyclic Law in January 2015. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Psychomanteum">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
