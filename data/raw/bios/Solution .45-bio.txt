After charting all over the world with Scar Symmetry and shortly before leaving  the band, vocalist Christian Älvestam and Miseration/Essence of Sorrow’s Jani Stefanovic return with a new solution, Solution .45! Joining them in this epic force to be reckoned with, are Tom Gardiner (Hateform), Anders Edlund (Angel Blake), Rolf Pilve (Miseration, Essence of Sorrow) and Mikko Härkin (ex-Sonata Arctica, Kotipelto).

Solution .45 formed in late 2007 in Sweden as a conceptual entity, but never blossomed into fruition until fall 2008, when the band recorded an 8-track demo with Tomas "Plec" Johansson (Unmoored, Scar Symmetry) handling production-duties. The band’s musical goal however, was quite daunting in its simplicity: mix in brutal riffs with unparalled melancholic atmosphere and epic, progressive song structures. Fortunately, with such top class musicians at the helm, meeting this goal was easily achieved. Solution .45 ushers forth some of the heaviest material any of the outfit’s members have ever previously worked with, but yet also some of the most complex and sophisticated as well. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Solution+.45">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
