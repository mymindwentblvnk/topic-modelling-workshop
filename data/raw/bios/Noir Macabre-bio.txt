NOIR MACABRE formed in mid 2005. With a collective interest in the dark and arcane, founding members 'Blassfemuur'( vocalist and drummer), and guitarist 'Heathen' forged tracks for the album "VICTORY-DARKNESS REIGNS FOREVER". Recording over a period of a few months at 'the cabin', and with input from fellow fiends Stormer and Jaxx, the album was completed.

   Citing influences such as Bathory, Marduk, Dark Throne, Horna, Sodom, Celtic Frost, Immolation, Immortal, Emperor and Possessed to name just a few. A video clip was filmed in June 2006 with film company 'Shotcore', and will be included as a cd-rom feature.

   "Victory" is set to be released shortly on Faultline records through Shock Australia. The band is contemplating the live show situation, and as yet require a line up in order to do so. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Noir+Macabre">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
