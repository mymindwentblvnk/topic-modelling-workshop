MINDSLIP, a progressive rock band, based out of Jacksonville Florida was established in 2005 by members Matt Boucher (vocalist) and Robert Miller (lead guitar).  The duo diligently strives to be just a little different than what’s out there and newest members,  John Smith (guitar), Taz Baker (bass), and James Overstreet (drums) are no exception to the vision.
