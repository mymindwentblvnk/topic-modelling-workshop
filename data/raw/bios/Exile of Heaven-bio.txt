Exile of Heaven is a Heavy Metal Band that was formed during the Summer of 2010 in Kozani, Greece.

Founding members were  Ilias Kytidis  (Lead Vocals, Rythm Guitars, composition) and  Pantelis Gkatziaris   (Lead Guitars, Backing Vocals) who came together after the split of their previous band. The two friends were looking for inspiring new members who would share the same passion and thirst for music and would be up for a new ambitious journey.

And the journey began and has been tremendous so far! A well received demo in 2012, titled "MEADOWS OF THE BEYOND" and an upcoming debut album in 2015 "THE ILLUSION OF RANDOMITY"!

Exile of Heaven are:

 Ilias Kytidis: Lead Vocals, Guitars 
 Pantelis Gkatziaris: Lead guitars  
 Anthimos Fliagkas: Bass guitars  
 Konstantina Kompou: Keyboards 
Thanasis Pliatsios: Drums 


We will never cease to try to expand their music, create new things and perform live whenever and wherever's possible! Contact us for anything that comes in your mind.
