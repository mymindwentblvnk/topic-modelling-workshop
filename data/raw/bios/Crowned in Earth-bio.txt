Crowned in Earth was formed by Kevin Lawry in 2008. After forming his own Death / Doom band, Silent Winter, Kevin decided to venture more into the traditional side of Doom. After a self-released EP titled ‘Welcome To The Brotherhood Of The Crown’ the foundation was laid down to make a bigger step into creating a full-length album with a stronger focus on the song writing.

During the autumn of 2009, with the progress of the new songs coming along Crowned In Earth signed with Shadow Kingdom Records. This time also saw the recruit of drummer Darin McCloskey (Pale Divine, Falcon, ex Sinister Realm) step in to play on the album.

This year has seen the release of Crowned In Earths debut album ‘Visions Of The Haunted’. The new songs have demonstrated a higher level of musicianship, a more compelling emotional range both dark in effect and tight in their grooves. This is document to Kevin’s most powerful song writing yet! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Crowned+in+Earth">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
