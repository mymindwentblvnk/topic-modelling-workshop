Written in Torment was formed in late 2003 by sole member Leviathan, whose intention was to create scathing black metal that was uncompromised in its artistic merit. Writing commenced immediately, and the initial demo entitled "The Uncreation" was recorded at Waylands Forge Studios by Jonny Maudling during the winter of 2005/2006. Originally planned as an independent release, Written in Torment received attention from upstart record label None More Black Records, and signed onboard as the first band on the label's roster.

After the release of The Uncreation, None More Black and Written in Torment split ways. 

2012: Written in Torment signs to Glorious North Productions, and the much awaited follow up album 'Bellum Omnuim Contra Omnes' is released May 14th 2013, again limited to 1000 copies.
