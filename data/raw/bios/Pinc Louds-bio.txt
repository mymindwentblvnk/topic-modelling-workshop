Pinc Louds (Claudi – vocals, guitar, kalimba. Marc Mosteirin – bass) could be described as the most unique voice on New York City’s underground music scene.

Lead singer and guitarist, Claudi, moved to New York from Puerto Rico in 2015 and formed Pinc Louds out of a need for creative and musical reinvention. Operating as a three-piece with a drummer and bass player, their songs – written equally in Spanish and English – draw from a lifetime of musical and local influences.

At once old-fashioned and completely new, Pinc Louds exist outside of any era. Their songs combine Jazzy 1920s vibrato-laden melodies with intricate vocal looping, a soothing kalimba, and a punk rock ferocity that often leaves strings broken and dangling from the pegs of Claudi’s acoustic guitar.

Pinc Louds brings a vibrancy and vitality to the streets of a city still recovering from a pandemic drought of live music. You’ll find them busking in front of packed crowds around New York’s East Village and Lower East Side. Against a backdrop of iconic landmarks like Tompkins Square Park, and the Delancey-Essex Street Station, audiences from all walks of life are lovingly encouraged to dance and let go of self-conscious inhibition. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pinc+Louds">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
