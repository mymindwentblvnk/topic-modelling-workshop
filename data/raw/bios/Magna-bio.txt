-------------------

2) Magna is the mainly instrumental rock project of four close friends based in and around Los Angeles, California-- Clay Kyke, Daniel Dykes, Morgan Light, and Ryan Knouf.  Magna has performed semi-regulary throughout the LA area since 2003 after longtime friends, Knouf and Dykes, reunited following the demise of their former bands.  The two, independent of one another, had been experimenting with alternate guitar tunings.  After hearing and playing along with Knouf's riffs, Dykes recruited his former band mates, Light and Kyle, to flesh out Magna's integral rhythm section.  Magna is closely linked with the LA underground art scene, having played the Cannibal Flower group art show on multiple occasions.

The group's sound is heavily influenced rhythmically by the band, Tool, and composer, Philip Glass.  Magna finds aesthetic guidance from artists as varied as Mogwai, The Cure, Massive Attack, Sonic Youth, Pink Floyd, Fugazi, and composer, Ennio Morricone .

Magna self-released an EP in 2003.  While 2007 saw the release of their first LP, Echo Location.
