P.O.BOX was formed in 2001 in Nancy, France.  Since then the band have been on intensive touring through Europe (France, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, England, Scotland, Germany, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Hungary, Slovenia, Italy, Sweden, Bulgaria...) increasing their reputation of having an "explosive stage performance".  Over 300 shows have been done by the band since its beginning.

Their 1st demo CD, "Fartcore", and 1st split CD, "We Are All In The Gutter", have been released on PioProd (France) and sold respectively to 2.000 and 1.500 issues without any distribution deal.  This means the band sold its CDs only on shows...  Quite impressive!

Signed on Winged Skull records (Lux) in June 2004, the guys released their 1st EP "Rock My Reality" and went once again on a huge European tour for 5 weeks which was an awesome success.

In October 2004, the band got sponsored by Shisha True Wear (D), and signed on anoter label, Power Pop Records (UK). 

Days fly by, and their songs are sometimes engaged, sometimes with a funny undertone, but P.O.BOX tries to carry over a message that urges their audience to stop and think about our current society's many problems…
