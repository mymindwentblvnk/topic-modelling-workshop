Alan Azar is a Lebanese guitarist, playing progressive metal and rock..  

He began his musical life in Beirut, Lebanon. At the age of fifteen his father introduced him to rock music, and an old classical guitar on which he began teaching himself tunes by The Beatles, Nirvana, and Metallica. Inspired by the guitar sound his father could only describe as "fuzz", Azar took up the electric guitar. He gained a degree in Musicology, formed his first band, and began work as a University music and guitar instructor. 

In 2001, Alan and his brother Roland Azar (keyboard), formed ALIENZ. The group quickly earned notoriety throughout Lebanon for their faithful renditions of songs by metal groups including Metallica, Megadeth, and Savatage. By 2003, the band had added new member, Ralph Choueri, on drums and changed their focus to writing and performing original progressive metal material influenced by Symphony X, Dreamtheatre, Joe Satriani, and others. After performing with the ALIENZ and amassing a loyal following over the next four years, Azar went solo in 2007. 

In January 2009, Azar released his first studio album, Defective Harmony. The album is the product of a collaboration with his brothers Julian (keyboard) and Roland (mixing and mastering). It features ten original tracks, each written and produced by Alan Azar and recorded in his bedroom (also known as Studio Recco) in Beirut, Lebanon . 

Azar has worked in other genres including jazz, R&B, hip-hop, rock, metal, and Middle-Eastern.
