Palms Trax is a producer and Dj based in Berlin, Germany. What began as an experiment in pad-driven Detroit workouts soon became Palms Trax calling card, the young producer building valve-heated, dust-treated slabs of house in his home studio, shot through with melodic synths and smooth, undulating drum patterns that recalls the likes of Legowelt, John Heckle, Tevo Howard, and Nu-Groove era Burrell Brothers.

His first record was released in October of 2013 on London-based imprint Lobster Theremin. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Palms+Trax">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
