Morgue of Saints is a solo project founded by Elliot C, based in Montreal, Canada, founded with the goal of releasing experimental and doom metal created and crafted solely by himself.

Sleep/Death is an instrumental experiment with abrasive drones, heavy percussions, acoustic and orchestral elements. It contains three pieces:

Sleep I: an orchestrated piece accompanied by heavy droning guitars;
Death: a very abrasive drone metal piece, heavily inspired by Earth's debut album;
Sleep II: a slow, mournful, but intense funeral doom piece. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Morgue+of+Saints">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
