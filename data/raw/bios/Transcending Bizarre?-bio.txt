Formed as a band in 2000 in Greece, Transcending Bizarre? recorded two promo CDs in the next couple of years. Transcending Bizarre? became an entity with the release of its debut album The Four Scissors in June 2003 under the label of SleaszyRider records. The debut album will be re-released soon by Vic Records worldwide containing 2 new tracks and amazing artwork from Seth (Paradise Lost, Old Man's Child etc).

In 2008 the band released its Magnum Opus entitled The Serpentâ€™s Manifolds (2008) unleashing an unprecedented attack of post-modern symphonic black metal. The album is an occult musical journey in the wonders of the stars, the coils of human mind, the construction of self and the mysticism of chaotic structures.
