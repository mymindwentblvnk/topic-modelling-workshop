Patrick "Sleepy" Brown is an R&B singer, songwriter, and record producer. He is one-third of the successful Atlanta-based production team of Organized Noize, which has created hits for acts such as OutKast, Goodie Mob, and TLC. TLC's "Waterfalls", penned by Brown and Organized Noize's Rico Wade and Ray Murray, was a #1 hit single on the Billboard Hot 100 in the summer of 1995.

Besides his production work, Brown also records as an artist himself, both for his own records (including his popular 2004 single "I Can't Wait" from the Barbershop 2: Back in Business soundtrack), and songs of collaborators such as Beyonce and Big Boi of OutKast (the #1 hit "The Way You Move").

He independently released a solo album in the early 2000s, which remains largely unheard.

He was slated to release an album on the DreamWorks Records label called "For the Grown and Sexy." But the release was scrapped when Dreamworks folded.

He is now signed to Outkast member Big Boi's label Purple Ribbon Records and is working on his album Mr.Brown, which is slated to be released sometime in 2006

Brown is the son of Jimmy Brown, the lead vocalist and saxophonist for the 1970s funk band Brick.
