From the Southern region of Cote-d'Azur, DrunkSouls has been creating Indie/Reggae music sonically similar to Manu Chao, Gorillaz, Michael Jackson and Damian Marley since 2002. Their music grows out of a variety of influences, facilitating dancing as well as thinking and “creating a unique sound with little to no borders,” says the Daily Consciousness. Sometimes lighthearted and other times heavy, their music carries a message of reconciliation and tolerance in which humor and gravity are able to coexist.
