Folk metal band from Barcelona, Spain.

In early 2010, after having played with several bands, Jandro just wanted to enjoy playing metal with good musicians and, if possible, good friends. So, he started thinking about forming a band. Departing from nothing, he started to think about telling good old friends/musicians about his idea. In a lucky strike, the rest of the band's members: Rubén, Cristian, Álvaro and Roser applied for the project and... Well, here we are, aiming for a good music set and starting to record our own demo tunes. More news will come in no time...
