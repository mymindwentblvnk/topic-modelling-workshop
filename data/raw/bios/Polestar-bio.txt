Polestar makes electronica: Grew up listening to all kinds of music, but is most influenced by Kraftwerk, Electro, Wendy Carlos, Cabaret Voltaire and the BBC radiophonic workshop. Polestar is obsessed with complicated beats and beautiful sounds. The music can best be described as melodic electronica; fusing together complex beat patterns with warm and atmospheric synthesizer tones, along with all kinds of self made and self recorded sounds.
