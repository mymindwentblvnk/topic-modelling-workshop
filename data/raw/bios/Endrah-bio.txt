The awesome and furious brazilian drummer Fernando Schaefer (Treta, Kiko Loureiro, Pavilh√£o 9 and solo artist), guitar player Covero and bassist TJ joined together in 2003 to compose some killer and extreme tracks and literally destroy the gap between hardcore and death metal. 
Thats how ENDRAH was formed: a brutal band, highly technical, mixing the fastness of death metal and the hardcore attitude. DEMONStration, the first EP from the band, had Scream S. on the vocals and was mixed in Underground Sound Studios from Billy Graziadei (Biohazard) in NY, United States. 
The 5 tracks of DEMONStration were aclaimmed worldwide, always underlining the amazing and creative technique of its musicians. Billy Graziadei participated in this EP playing the second guitar and toured in Brazil with the band in 2004. 
In the end of 2004, when ENDRAH had started the pre-production of its first album in Brazil, Graziadei was commited with his agenda in the States and couldnt continue with the band. Thats when they decided for just one guitar and a far moretight result for it, as it was their first proposal. During this time, ENDRAH publishes an official announcement recruiting its front-man. Vocalists from all over the world sent working material justifying that the band was already respected and admired in diferent places and cultures. The american vocalist Relentless from San Francisco - California, was the chosen one. 
The provocative and harassingly lyrics from Relentless joined the infuriating tracks of ENDRAH. This unique combination, ENDRAH first full-lenght album, is now released in Germany and Europe through Coretex Records/Grapes of Wrath and in Latino America through Dynamo Records.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Endrah">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
