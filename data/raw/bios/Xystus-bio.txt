Xystus is a Dutch band that was found in 1998 by Ivo van Dijk. Their music can be described as Progessive Power Metal, yet it is more Melodic than that. Xystus is mainly influenced by symphonic bands such as Symphony X and Dream Theater. but movie soundtracks are an important source of inspiration as well.

Their first album, 'Receiving Tomorrow' was accompanied with a lot of shows in The Netherlands supporting Epica, Kamelot and Autumn.

In 2006 they released their second album "Surreal" but instead of touring they worked on their third Album "Equilibrio".

Equilibrio is a Rock Opera written by Xystus and performed live with the USConcert in July 2008. Several other artists appeared in it like: Simone Simons (Epica), John Vooijs, Michelle Splietelhof and George Oosthoek. In 2009 the band released their first live DVD with of the Equilibrio show. It is a 3 disc box including the DVD disc with the live material and 2 CD's containing the audio of the same show.
