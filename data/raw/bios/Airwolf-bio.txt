Claiming official remixes for Muscles (Modular), Parachute Youth (Sweat It Out!) Trumpdisco and The Swiss (Kitsune) Australian based DJ/Producer/Photographer Airwolf has already set a standard high for himself. His noticeable production skills matched by his energetic DJ show he now turns in an infectious slice of drive-time summer vibes on new single “Hanging On”.

Growing up on healthy dose of musicality (his father still showcasing his skills on the decks today) Airwolf’s DJ residences cross borders, four states in total Australia wide, and support slots alongside the likes of well, everyone on festival stages from Summadayze and Falls Festival to Splendour In The Grass have made him a known figure on the Australian indie dance scene. Now Airwolf takes the natural progression up from DJ to Producer to Hook Merchant – the sound on “Hanging On’ infusing all the fun of bare-feet festival-field dancing with the uptempo vibe of cruising an Australian coastal beach town looking for true teen love!

Hang On!
