Fred W. Warmsley III made a name for himself producing beats for underground hip-hop MCs like Joey Bada$$, but after signing to Ninja Tune and releasing two albums that all but abandoned hip-hop in favor of experimental jungle and ambient music, he stopped making music under his prior alias (Lee Bannon) and began using the name Dedekind Cut. The work created under his updated moniker is dark, volatile, jarring, and unpredictable, recalling the frenzied breakcore of Venetian Snares, the haunted U.K. garage of Burial, and elements of gabber/hardstyle, grime, ambient, and mutated Southern rap. Dedekind Cut's first release was the self-issued tHot eNhan√ßeR EP in September of 2015. In early 2016, Dedekind Cut and Rabit joined forces on a blistering EP on Ninja Tune titled R&D. A self-issued single named "Last" appeared shortly after, and a Black History Month-themed mix titled BHM/N3D was released by Non Worldwide. In March, the ambient drone tape American Zen was issued by Dominick Fernow's Hospital Productions. Dedekind Cut's full-length debut, $uccessor, combining dark ambient with new age, appeared in November; Non Worldwide released it on vinyl, while Hospital Productions issued it on cassette. An EP titled The Expanding Domain was released by Hallow Ground in 2017. Dedekind Cut signed to Kranky that year, and second full-length Tahoe followed in 2018.
