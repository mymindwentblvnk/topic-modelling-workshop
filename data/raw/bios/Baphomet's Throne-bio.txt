There are two band with this name:


1. Year 1992 Frosty winter the revelation of blasphemy began.

Crew of condemned horde called “OPPRESSOR” is brought to life by Von Bojba guit/voc Pitbull /Drums/ and Nosferatu /Bass/ join him.
The first hellish outburst from abyss is Demo (1992) “Time Of Agony” presented play on concerts on the underground scene.
In year 1993 there are some changes in the crew Samchiel /Bass/ ex Nuctumerun and Tom Barlog /drums/ from Infernum join in.
After sometime the second guitarist Martin joins in.
May 1994 undergound of improvised studio, which is saturated with darkness and full of evil, releases next unholy child ''Blasphemous Thougts''.
The evil fury emanates from artism of this music, crushes the carcass of Jew-Christians and the posers.
There appear any keyboard parties in the tuneby the idea and arrangement of Von Bojba.
In sessions, Rob Darken /Graveland/ helps on keyboard; the guy in well-known on the Black Metal scene.
In May 1995, Baron Records oficially publishes this venom with two new pieces.
This time “Blaspnemus Thougts”is recorded in professional studio; 45 minutes of blasphemy.
In 1996, Left Hand /Key/, responsible fro keyboard, joins the horde; he’s well-known from the horde of Arkona.
In 1998 a decision to change the name of the band is taken due to the fact that in the USA there is already a band called like that.
The new name, “Baphomets Throne” is fully adequate for the music played by the band. It reflects the idea and sends the message of this dark music.
The passing time… and some chenges in crew (IX Abass /Bass/ takes place of the so-far basist /Dominus/, who played with the band for a while) have slowed down the work over realisation of the new publishing.

Year 2000/2001

Baphomets Throne slowly and with some breakes makes another blasphemous product. Its poisonous fruit is “Spiritual Evil”, 25 minutes of pure fire.
The timeless music paralyses with its depth and intrasigence.
Only an ignorant or a blind fool for whom this music is roughless whip lashing the brain won’t see its pluses.
July 2003, a limited edition of the album “Spiritual Evil” is published by Panzer Truppen Rec.
Panzer Truppen Rec. plans to re-edit the cult Blasphemous Thougts, which will be more furious in tone as it will be mastered.
Meanwhile, Forneus /Bass/ joins the horde. At present, Baphomets Throne is working over the new album, the time will sooner end the plague which will flood the human valley.
Neberius has been playing keyboard since October 2003
Baphomets Throne thanks for back-up in Underground’s: Zines, Distro, Maniax… who used to supported our horde.

The present crew:

Von Bojba /Guitar, Vocal/
Renfas /Guitar/
Forneus /Bass/
Pitbull /Drums/
Naberius /Keyboard/
