There are two bands with this name

1.
Country: Belgium
Status: Active
Description: One-man project of Stijn van Cauter from Until Death Overtakes Me. Extreme Funeral Doom not often heard! Ultra slow, beyond heavy, unforgiving bone-chilling grunts, gutteral sounds staight from hell itself. Haunting and crushing at the same time. This is one of the most promising Funeral Doom acts around. Fans of Thergothon, Hierophant and Skepticism won't be disappointed!
