FUNERAL DUST - started in the winter of 2004/early 2005 after Permanent Midnight took a break from shows and to pursue other interests. In March 2005 Wulv (Vox & Synth of Permanent Midnight) purchased an ESP-Viper and a MAPEX kit and started writing songs for his upcoming album "Covered By Snow Drift". And began recording in May with Dan K. (Pyramid of Man), Mixing and Recording. And in "Covered By Snow Drift" Dan K. took the place of Session Drummer for the Album. Funeral Dust is now in the progress of working on a Full Length album! To be released next year. Adding to the lineup Damian will be taking the place of session drums on the album and will be working on bass for the album as well.
