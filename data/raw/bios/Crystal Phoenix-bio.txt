Crystal Phoenix was born in 1989 by the effort of a single figure: Myriam Sagenwells Saglimbeni who wrote, played, sang and even drew the cover of the eponymous debut work. This musical genre, which could be termed progressive, has been called epic-classic by the authoress. It is epic because, by means of music, she can draw a parallelism with ancient myths (even if with hard rock-heavy influences) and classic because she uses instruments such as: harp, flutes and harpsichord. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Crystal+Phoenix">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
