Beyond Other Dimensions, so called "B.o.D", was founded in Joutseno, Finland, in the year 2005 by Joonas Talka and Aleksi Nieminen. Joonas and Aleksi started playing music by listening to a few of their favourite artists, Iron Maiden, Megadeth, Judas Priest and so on, and practicing on those band's songs for a time. After taking up the music and founding their band B.o.D they've faced a few member changes in the band as some "wannabes" or even more talented ones have came in and then quit suddenly. 

The band has went through a couple of years finding their own musical style and making their own material with care. The band recorded their first demo at the end of the 2007 in Joutseno and experienced a tough member loss as the drummer Jussi Pentikäinen quit the band after hitting those amazing drum beats on the demo. The band found a replacer for Jussi as Kalle Ollikainen joined the band in the beginning of 2008.

The band recorder their second demo in MD-studio in Helsinki and pushed a real turbo drive in their music. The songs were faster, tougher, more thrashier, more progressive, harder and more kicking ass! 
But unfortunately, again, they were lacking a drummer as Ollikainen decided to move away from Joutseno for personal purposes in the summer of 2008.

Then after a "silent" period after Kalle left the band, they composed more new stuff and continued finding new drummer... after some time they changed in the same episode, as Lassi Valtonen came in for a little time to the drumseat,  Erkki Neuvonen for Tuomas Pihlajärvi. Erkki Neuvonen couldn't really manage as a singer and he was a brake for the bands success. So after some coincidences the band found Tuomas who had succeeded for example in Idols and some karaoke challenges, and practiced singing for 8 years. Tuomas has in the same time a very bright and melodic voice but still can add a nice rush to his singing which gives cool variety to B.o.D's songs. 

After Tomas came in, the band couldn't continue with Lassi either because he didn't seem to take the training so seriously. The band made a "reunion" with Kalle and eventually Kalle moved back to Joutseno what was a lottery award like affair for the band. Now the line-up has stabilized and band has published its third EP, Nuclear Family, which is without a doubt the band's best performance ever and it is a showdown for all the listeners. 

The band relies on their musical talents as players and musicians, but the main thing that thrives the band is the music itself: the groundings of heavy metal can be heard in the band's music but not without throwing their own creativity in. The band has decided to hail for the essence of metal, but is still to make something unique and epic...memorable...
