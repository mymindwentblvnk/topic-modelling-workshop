Die Haut were an experimental German post-punk / post-rock industrial band, who enjoyed underground success in the 1980s, with such records as the Nick Cave collaboration Burnin' The Ice. The only constant member has been Christoph Dreher.
Formed in 1982 as an instrumental rock quartet, many of their recordings and live performances featured an array of international guest vocalists.
Their last full-length album was Spring (1997) followed by a remix album called Springer (1998). At the same time the band went on hiatus, Remo Park and Christoph Dreher have continued to work as separate acts, and Jochen Arbeit with Rudi Moser joined the Berlin-based underground legend Einstürzende Neubauten. Remo Park passed away † 20 September 2016 (Berlin) after a solo career with 4 released solo albums Lying in Ambush (1990), Aviator is chasing time (1995), Alien Healer (2011), Witchcraft Power (2014). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Die+Haut">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
