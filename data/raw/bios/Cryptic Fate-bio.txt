Cryptic Fate is one of the pioneer heavy metal bands from Bangladesh. The band was started in 1993 by a group of school going students. In 1994 the band released their first album - an English album - titled Ends Are Forever under Soundtek Productions.

In 1997 they composed their second album, a Bangla album titled Sreshtho. Due to a small fanbase of heavy metal music in Bangladesh back then, few record labels wanted to sign them. In 2001 Cryptic Fate released the massively successful track "Cholo Bangladesh" in the mixed album 'Chharpotro'. The release of Chharpotro saw the underground scene (both musicians and fanbase) boom. 

In 2002, Cryptic Fate's album Sreshtho finally gets released under G-Series, presently the biggest rock label in Bangladesh. The album was revolutionary in terms of composition and boosted the band's popularity.

In the following years they released a number of tracks through mixed albums, of which Prem, and Onadorer Shontan were huge hits.

Their 3rd album Danob is due to release in the summer of July 2006. Cryptic Fate continues to be one of the major bands in Bangladesh, and as the fanbase for heavy metal music increase so does the popularity of the band. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cryptic+Fate">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
