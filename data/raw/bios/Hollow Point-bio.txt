1) Hollow Point are an emerging djent/modern metalcore band from Boston, MA. They released their first full length, Poltergeist, in 2015 to little fanfare but quickly drew favorable comparisons to contemporaries such as Heart as a Coward and similar forward-thinking metal acts worldwide. Their sharp interplay and polished sound has seen them make waves locally and internationally and 2017's Bloodshot EP sees them finding confidence in recreating the bludgeoning sound of their illustrious peers. You don't have to recreate the wheel in order to destroy it.

2) Hollow Point is a group made up of Chicano Rap pretenders Knightowl and Lil One. They released their first hit album The Little & The Owl under Familia Records in 2000.
