The dark entity of Viirastus was summoned in the spring of 2007. It then consisted of two warriors named Ingwar and Sajatus. The plan was to make gloomy and dark depressive black metal in the mood of Xasthur but the group then decided that it's not their thing and started to make more faster and original black metal. In the fall of 2007 the bassist called Kodukäija joined the legion. In 2009 two guitarists Maru and Alla-Xul joined to strengthen the legion lines. Now the band has found their style and is ready to spread it.

Current Lineup
Ingwar - Voice of the Viirastus and misty guitar
Kodukäija - Four strings of death
Sajatus - Pounding heathen drums of war
Maru - 666 strings of unholy rage
Alla-Xul - Guitars
