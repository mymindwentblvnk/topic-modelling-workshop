1. Experimental death metal band Inner Rage began in its first incarnation in 1996 in San Paulo, Brazil, formed from members of Necrolust and Screams of Hate.

After recording a two-track demo “Ignorance/Sarajevo” and regularly gigging in the underground metal scene, in 1998 the band’s founding members - guitarist vocalist Thiago Carvalho and drummer Henrique Des Reis - decided to relocate and reform the band in London where they soon found bassist Sam Pabaker to complete the line up. But not long after, Henrique decided to move back to Brazil, making way for current drummer Nicolas Soteri, formerly of Black List. Then Sam left the band and Inner Rage went through a stage of bass crisis until 2003, when Yusuf Tary, formerly of Senseless, joined to complete the line-up of Inner Rage that exists today.
