1. A metal band from Poland: 
Silesia- region of heavy and smoky industry, poisoning soil and historical changes, was a good nest of metal music. In the year 1985 Heintich Damian Beck, a very young vocalist with huge ambitions, decided to found a band with professional aims. For the collaboration he invited young top musicians from the local bands. One of them was and still is until today, guitar player and composer Christoph Blaszak. Durning the next three years DAMA PIK (it was the first name of the band, later shortened into PIK) have played a large numbers of live shows. As well they were presented on radio and TV, mainly on the silesian territory, where the band was wellknow. In the end of year 1987 the band began the preparations for the production of their debut album. Unfortunately it was canceled and in the beginning of 1988 mastermind Heinrich D. Beck decided to move to Germany. The band split up.
