María Isabel Severino (born May 24, 1996), known simply as María Isabel, is a Dominican-American R&B singer, songwriter and model from New York City, USA.

María Isabel grew up in a musical family while living in Queens. She always knew she wanted to make music, citing powerful women such as Alicia Keys, Mariah Carey and Lauryn Hill as her biggest influences.

She studied in the music program at New York University while singing for the campus' a cappella group, APC Rhythm. It was only during her first year at NYU that she started writing and recording her own songs, giving her a new outlet to express her thoughts and feelings. Soon after, she began to gain popularity through her Instagram and SoundCloud, where she would publish covers in addition to her own music.

After graduation, María Isabel moved to Los Angeles to further her career. In February 2020, she released her debut single “The 1,” followed by her debut EP Stuck In The Sky in October, which is based on the painful experience of a long-distance relationship. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Mar%C3%ADa+Isabel">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
