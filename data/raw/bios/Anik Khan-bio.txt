Anik Khan was born in Dhaka, Bangladesh and raised in Astoria, Queens, New York.  His father was involved in politics as a freedom fighter in the Bangladesh Liberation War, who sought political asylum in the US when Anik was four years old.

Being managed by Fadia Kade, Def Jam’s director of brand partnerships and strategic marketing, he started Khanfidénce (an ode to teaching himself charisma and confidence and to repel any more bullying) and almost got signed. Yet he never released anything as Anik Khan until the "I Don't Know Yet - EP" (July 2015), including the singles "Shadows" and "The Knowing". "Too late now", produced by Jarreau Vandal, was released in February 2016.
