Hanoi Janes is the one-man project of Oliver Scharf from Sachsen, Germany. Armed with an 8-track recorder, one mic, and a stack of slightly degenerated pop nuggets, Scharf is a one-man parade, combining heavy hearted simplicity with sunny and naive bubblegum pop. "Hanoi Jane" refers to the nickname given to Jane Fonda in the 70s because of her anti-war stance on Vietnam.

Hanoi Janes' debut album, Year of Panic was released by Captured Tracks in March 2010.
