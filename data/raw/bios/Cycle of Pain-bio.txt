John J.D. DeServio’s career as a bassist can be defined only as formidable and impressive. His time spent with Black Label Society has taken him around the world and made him a sought after bassist for clinics from Japan to South America and back. But long before he began globetrotting J.D. started out like most accomplished musicians, in the garage with a band and whiskey. 25 years later, that same band has emerged as Cycle of Pain with an intense and diverse self titled hard rock album.

Though rooted in metal, the album’s 12 tracks delve into elements of funk, hip-hop and soul. The core of the band is the same with Gregg as lead vocals, Joe Taylor on guitar and Rich Monica (Tantric) on drums. Cycle Of Pain also features performances by Zakk Wylde (Black Label Society, Ozzy), Ray Luzier (Korn) Brian Tichy (Billy Idol), Sen Dog (Cypress Hill), Russ-T Cobb, Hugo Ferreira (Tantric), Marcus Ratzenboeck (Tantric), Clip Payne (P-funk), Burton C Bell (Ascension of Watchers, Fear Factory) & Russell Allen (Symphony X).
