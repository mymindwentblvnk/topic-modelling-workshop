Romance Curse was born in May 2005, the vision of guitar virtuoso Marco. It was his intention to create a power metal group with a melodic, soaring sound, symphonic and edgy, and breaking with the angry excesses of metal tradition of the last twenty years. The group reformed from "Night Anthem" after the singer left due to artistic differences. Soon after the split, Marco met Angelica and immediately realized she was the element to complete his creation. In quick succession came Enea on bass and Marco on drums, both members of the fallen Night Anthem. There was immediately a great chemistry, and soon the band was to be completed with the addition of fifth element Matteo (keyboardist of Night Anthem). Soon the songs begin to flow from their fertile musical imagination. The result is a powerful, sophisticated and unique sound, with elements of Nightwish, Sonata Arctica, Stratovarius, Dream Theater, Kamelot and Dragonland, and from their own ideas. 
In the middle of 2007, Romance Curse released their EP, called "First Chapter: Redemption". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Romance+Curse">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
