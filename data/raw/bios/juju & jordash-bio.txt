Juju & Jordash met over a decade ago in Haifa. They each had their own lives going on at the time, but found one another through weekly be-bop jams. Throughout the 1990s, each played in and composed for various jazz and experimental combos by day and, by cover of night, dancing in clubs and experimented with electronic dance music.

J&J have released numerous EP, LPs and remixes since 2004 on record labels such as Dekmantel, Golf Channel Recordings, and on Workshop as Magic Mountain High, together with David Moufang (aka Move D), as well as several ambient, film soundtracks and multimedia projects.
They are based in Amsterdam at the moment.

They love and hate you all :( <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Juju+&+Jordash">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
