Havoc Theory is four-piece metal band from Pittsburgh, PA. Through a fusion of 80s thrash metal and newer heavy and death metal, Havoc Theory has created a powerful, heavy sound with a vintage 80s feel. Theyâ€™ve brought back what made metal stand out and have added in what makes metal so brutal today.
