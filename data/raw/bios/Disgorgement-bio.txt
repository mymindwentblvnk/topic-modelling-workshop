The German Death Metal band DISGORGEMENT was founded in 2006 by (ex-drummer) Dennis, guitarist Morten and bassist Danny. After several lineup changes Arne (vocals) and Jonah (ex-guitar) came into the Band, new material was written and after a few months, the second vocalist Hendrik came into the band. In 2007 the Demo "Exercised Fantasies" was recorded. In fall 2008 Jonah had to leave the band due to personal differences, but after some time a new guitarist, Waldemar (Wowa) was found. In June 2009, (ex-drummer) Dennis had to leave the band due of disagreement. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Disgorgement">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
