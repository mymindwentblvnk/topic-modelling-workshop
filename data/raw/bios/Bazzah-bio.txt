Bazzah is a black metal band from Pahang, Malaysia found in 1993. Despite the constant oppression by the local government, cult primitive Malaysian black metal force Bazzah manages to keep on releasing its fierce Satanic blasphemy, and they have done so since the band's initiation in the late 1990s.

Having done one full length album before 'Kingdom of the dead', the pressing of this debut album 'Death is all I see' got destroyed by the government after only having sold 300 copies, making the album extremely hard to find. Their second full length album Kingdom of the Dead includes all songs of their first album Death Is All I See... .
