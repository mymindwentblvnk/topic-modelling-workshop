"Shadow's Mignon" was born out of an idea Henning Pauly had one day. He heard some classic metal in the car and decided to try to write some music in this style on his own. He employed the help of singer Juan Roos to give the project the definite metal vocal sound. At some point Keyboard player Stephan Kernbach brought over his Roland D50 for the official 80's keyboard sounds. He laid down some parts of his own, especially his signature Hammond B3 playing. The music of the band is everything you would expect from the glory days of the 80's when guitar solos still screamed and vocals soared just like the eagles and dragons they were singing about. The album also features a few of the "must-have" ballads with all the classic chorusy guitars and keyboard sounds. "We were able to do so many things and use so many sounds we are told we "can't use anymnore" today because they are out of date, so we went back to our roots and made music that cannot live without them.", says Henning. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Shadow%27s+Mignon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
