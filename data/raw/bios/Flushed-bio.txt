2) Flushed

The metal band Flushed formed in Örebro, Sweden sometime during the late 1990s. Their style stems from classical trash and death metal with powerful and somewhat catchy melodical arrangements with a lot of progressive influences. Lead guitarist and head writer Simon Solomon adds his personal solo and lead style which is distinctive to their sound.

The band released two demos: "Like Dust" in 2002 and "The Day" in 2003, both produced by the Mieszko Talarczyk (Nasum) at SoundLab Studios in Örebro. The demos received positive reviews and were ranked "best demo band of the year" by Sweden's largest hardrock magazine, "Close-Up".

The band broke up in 2004. In 2007, there was talk of a possible reunion and a gig in Örebro with Meshuggah.
