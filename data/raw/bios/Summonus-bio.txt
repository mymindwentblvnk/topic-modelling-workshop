Summonus formed in mid 2007 in Sydney, Australia through like-minded musicians wanting to create punishing and brutal sounds involving huge groove based guitar riffs, hauling powerful drums and acidic, gravel-fuelled vocals. Each band member has had experience playing in numerous other bands in Sydney, Melbourne and Scotland over the years from a variety of styles including Grindcore, Hardcore, Punk and Rock. Listening to bands such as Black Sabbath, Celtic Frost, Electric Wizard, High on Fire, Pod People and Bongzilla gets the band inspired to play and write bone crushing slabs of low end riffage. After less than 12 months gigging Summonus have been well received and have had the privelage of playing with many fine bands including Blood Duster, Pod People, Monarch(France), Realized(Japan), Winnebago Deal(UK), Dad they Broke Me, Looking Glass, Fattura Della Morte, Roadside Burial, Deathcage, Maus, Taipan, Ebolie, Walrora and Clagg. Summonus have an exclusive track “The Gallows” featuring on the upcoming Unbeleivably Bad Compilation CD. Summonus have just released their first self titled CD featuring 5 tracks clocking in at 32 minutes. The CD was recorded at Zen Studios in Sydney by Geoff Lee and mixed and mastered by Jason PC (Blood Duster), in the depths of his seedy home studio Goatsounds in Melbourne.
