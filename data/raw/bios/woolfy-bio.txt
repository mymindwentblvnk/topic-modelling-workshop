Originally hailing from London, Woolfy started hitting the clubs in Los Angeles in 1991, back in the Flammable Liquid era and later Does Your Mama Know, and onto The Harvey Sessions. Started dj'ing in 1995, founded the deep house & funk club Pressure, and went on to be resident for Stereophonic at the legendary Fais Do Do. He started Projections with Dan Hastie (Breakestra / Orgone) in 2000 as well as the rudy band Sounds From The Ward. Projections went on to be signed by Guidance recordings and released the lp Between Here & Now and various singles. He's also worked with Plant Life, Orgone & Pharcyde. While in New York around 2004, he met DJ Spun of Rong Records playing at his local. A few bottles of rum later, Rong records was releasing the Woolfy / Projections split single. A few spliffs later and If You Know What's Good For Ya!! was complete. His influences include dirty disco, the rare 12"s from 73-84, a bit of English punk, pub funk, and booze.
