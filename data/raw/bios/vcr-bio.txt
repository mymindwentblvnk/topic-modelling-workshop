There are two bands called VCR:

1. VCR is a punk rock/electronica hybrid band that does not bill themselves as "adventure funcore" but continues to be called so. The band comes from Richmond, Virginia.

The band itself has had a consistent lineup throughout its short life, possessing 5 members. Chad Middleton provides vocals and plays keyboard, Mya Anitai also sings and plays keyboard, Casey Tomlin plays keyboard, Steve Smith plays bass, and Christian Newby plays drums. The music itself has its own distinct style, which can be due in part of the frenetic lyrics, the keyboard trio, and the complete absence of a guitar giving the bass player a true opening to shine at all times.

2. VCR is also a freeky-zeeky punk band from Toronto active since 2013. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/VCR">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
