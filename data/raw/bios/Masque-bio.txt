There are many Masques, including one from the UK & another from Chile.

The UK Masque is a latin / celtic jazz / worldbeat outfit.

Meanwhile, in Chile, there's Javier Labarca (born Santiago, 1986), a.k.a Masque. Since he was a kid, he showed interest for musical instruments & played guitar in various rock bands. He's been producing music for 6 years now starting with Hip Hop beats, but then he started listening electronic music, being his maximum influences Sasha and Hernán Cattaneo, thing that made him start producing principally progressive and tech house. Nowdays he has found support from many local and international dj´s because of his music.
