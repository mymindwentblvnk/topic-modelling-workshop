Kate Pierson is one of the singers of The B-52's (along with Cindy Wilson and Fred Schneider), and contributed to several works beyond her band, most notabily on Iggy Pop's song Candy and the album Out of Time from R.E.M.. She was a member of the largely unknown japanese group called NiNa, with former Judy and Mary lead singer YUKI and other great artists, but their work was noted most on Japan. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kate+Pierson">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
