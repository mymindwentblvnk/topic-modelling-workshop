Soulreaper was a blackened Death metal band from Gothenburg, Sweden. After Tobias and Johan left Dissection, they formed this band as a death/black metal outfit. They took their name from a Dissection song from the "Storm Of The Light's Bane" album.

Before releasing their first full-length, the band, which originally was named 'Reaper' had to change their name because of copyright problems with a band under the same name. Consequently, they added 'Soul' to once 'Reaper' in order to create less confusion. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Soulreaper">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
