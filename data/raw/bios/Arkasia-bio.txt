Arkasia began playing violin at age 5. By age 10 he was playing with an orhestra and by 12 was collaborating on the creation of mini-operas. A self-taught drummer in a metal band by 2000 he began to compose electronic music founding the ADAPTEK's collective with two friends. This collaboration led to the creation of the band ANTROPOD and the infamous live performance known as Polakatek. He left the collective in 2008 to pursue his own projects.

His influences include classical, speedcore, breakcore, dnb, trip hop, metal and more. Some of the biggest influences are Venetian Snares, Aphex Twin, Meshuggah, Bjork, Autechre etc... Those influences can be felt a lot in his compositions, trying to mix a maximum of those styles into one direction. 

In 2011 he began approaching Dubstep trying to create something new and personal with heavy distorted basses, gabber-like synths and a heavily melodic foundation. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Arkasia">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
