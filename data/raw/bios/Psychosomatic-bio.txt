There are several artists with this name:

1) From the depths of Salinas California the Thrash Metal band PSYCHOSOMATIC was twisted into form in 1988. Spewing forth chaotic blasts of skate rock from blaring amplification, Psychosomatic has carved their trench in the thrash metal world and has continued to build momentum leaving blistered ear drums in their wake. First off was the “and now you’ve had it demo” in 1990 that opened the eyes of Thrasher Magazine’s Skate Rock vol. 9 in 1990. After several short-run releases and line up changes the band moved to Sacramento, Ca. in 1998 and released their debut album, “Tales of the Unbelievably Cheap” in 1999. Two years later the band re-released a compilation of their most prized cuts entitled “88-98 the Salinas Years” in 2002. Finally with the current line-up solidified in concrete, Psychosomatic released its monstrous “The Unquenchable Thirst” album that lifted the band to a new level of conquering in 2006. Several tours and some personal demons cultivated into the band’s newest addition to its arsenal, entitled…”Another Disease” in 2010. This album is the band’s most grand recording. Still staying true to their punk/thrash metal origins and with a more dark and twisted format, Another Disease proves that faster and darker is always better… CHAOS!

2) A hip hop group from Iowa City, Iowa, USA featuring collaborative verse by several I.C. MCs and help from Jon Hansen of The Slats.  They had several recordings including a self titled full length released on Marion, Iowa's The Tyros Label.

3) A psytrance project. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Psychosomatic">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
