"Y'golonac are a black metal band founded by Chernobog in early 2008. Shortly after starting the band, he invited Nunsodomizer to join the band as a drummer. Eventually, Nunsodomizer took over all the instruments and the band recorded and released their first demo, "Mass of the Flesh" in 2009. In 2010, the band signed with NecroVomit Productions. The band are currently working on new material. "
