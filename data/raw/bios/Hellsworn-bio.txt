Hellsworn was formed in 2010 by guitarists Tom Hinksman and Tom Mckenna who both shared a mutual love for the old school death metal scene (the Swedish scene in particular) and also a vision to create a REAL death metal force to counteract the current trend of weak-as-fuck, fake music being churned out by so called death metal bands. The end of 2010 saw the unleash of the bands debut demo available from this page! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hellsworn">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
