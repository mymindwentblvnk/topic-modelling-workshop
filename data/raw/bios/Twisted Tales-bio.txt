Twisted tales are Melodic Death/Thrash Metal band from Kuršumlija, Serbia, founded on 8th of December 2004. Conceptualized as a Melodic Death Metal, the band recorded their first demo in the mid 2005, titled “Behind Gates of Eternity”. The band ceased to exist shortly after. In early 2009, three of the founding members of the band gathered again, and with the new guy on the bass guitar, they crystallized the band’s sound as a mixture of an “Old and New School of Thrash Metal” with strong Melodeath influence. 

The band are: 

Bass and vocals - Đorđević Ljubiša
Guitars – Milovanović Miša
Drums – Velicki Nemanja
