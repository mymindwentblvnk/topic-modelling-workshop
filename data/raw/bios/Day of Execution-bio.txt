Day of Execution is a death metal band hailing from the city of Varna, Bulgaria. The band was initially called REICHSRADIO and was formed in 2005 as a brutal death/grind project . The style and the conception have altered much since then, mostly due to lineup changes. They now play old-school death metal.During the years of development  they decided to change the name of the band to DAY OF EXECUTION (inspired by Steven King’s novel “The Green Mile”). Day of Execution have had many memorable shows in Bulgaria, supporting bands like TURBOCHARGED, MASTER (US), ENDEZZMA, GRAVE, SINISTER, MALEVOLENT CREATION, AGATHOCLES, NEGURA BUNGET, BANE, POPPY SEED GRINDER, SQUASH BOWELS, GRAVE DESECRATOR, DAMNGOD, LOUDRAGE, KROW, CASUS and others. In January 2012  the Polish label Brewery Prod. released their first album called "Dead Burning to Ashes".
On 15 Nov 2013 Canadian Mulligore Productions released "Pointless Cause" EP - 4 songs of pure old school death metal. 
Band comments: “While working on material for a new album, we decided to release a four-song EP to serve as a hint for the upcoming material. Our previous full-length album, “Dead Burning to Ashes”, contained mostly reworked songs, composed before the lineup changes in 2009, when our style was much different. But now, this upcoming release will reaffirm the style direction we’ve taken in the past three years – catchy and neckbreaking, mid-paced death metal. The lyrical themes are various – war, death, insanity and of course loads of blood and gore, all mixed in a pleasantly gruesome combination.”

In the begining of 2018 the band signed with German Neckbreaker Records to release their second album entitled "Inevitable Ebd" - 10 tracks of crushing neckbreaking old school death metal!
