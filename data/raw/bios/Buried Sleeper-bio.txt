As with any band straddling the genres of doom/stoner metal, Buried Sleeper began as a Black Sabbath-worshipping jam band, honing their sound into something far more unique and interesting. It is this sound that you hear now and has been critically acclaimed through live shows and album reviews. Buried Sleeper have been around for a long time in one form or another but are currently going strong with their anti-clich√© brand of heaviness.
