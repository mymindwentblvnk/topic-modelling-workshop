Imminent Annihilation formed in late 2011 and has been constantly evolving since day one. In 2014 they entered the studio to record their debut EP; The Annex Between Creation and Annihilation, available on Spotify, iTunes, Google Play and other online retailers and streaming sites.

Since then they have been working on different styles of metal, taking influence from wherever they found it and are now currently working on a follow up to 'Annex'. They are entering the studio at the end of September 2018 to begin recording their debut full length album (as yet untitled), which they plan to release in 2019. 
Through taking part and winning Bloodstockâ€™s Metal 2 The Masses competition (Oxford region), they secured they a spot on the New Blood Stage at Bloodstock Festival 2018.
