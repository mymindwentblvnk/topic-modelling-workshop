Rottrevore were an old school death metal band from Pennsylvania, USA. They were formed in 1989 around core members Chris Free (Bass), Chris Weber (Vocals / Guitars) and Mark Mastro (Vocals / Guitars). The band played a very rhythmic style of death metal which used a crushing guitar tone, atmospheric pedals and exploring drums. Their style could be compared to that of bands such as Uncanny and Wombbath.

In 1990 the band unleashed their first demo The Epitome of Pantalgia before signing to Relapse Records to release 1991's Copulation of the Virtuous and Vicious EP. Another EP, Fornication in Delirium was released in 1992. After a change of drummers the band began to write their debut album. Iniquitous, which was released in 1993  by Drowned Productions, was a huge step up from its predecessors, with increased production values, more atmospheric influences and exceedingly heavy riffage earning it some great reviews and a strong reception from the underground scene.

The band also contributed songs to the Son of Bllleeeeaaauuuurrrrgghhh! and Pantalgia compilations.

The band split up in around 1995 due to musical differences and other commitments.

All tracks from Rottrevore's Copulation of the Virtuous and Vicious EP appeared on Volume 3 of Relapse Records' Singles Series compilations, which was released in 2004. In 2005, Necroharmonic released, Disembodied, a compilation of demo, EP, compilation and live tracks.

The band had reunited for the New Jersey Death Metal Fest in the October of 2009 but they cancelled their appearance. As of December 2010 they are now fully active and will be writing and recording new material as well as playing live. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rottrevore">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
