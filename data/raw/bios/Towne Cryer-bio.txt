(1) Towne Cryer was a Christian metal band formed in the 1990s in Southern California.  They had two releases on Nehemiah records.  The first being Against All Evil which was released in 1992 and Death By Sin which was released in 1998.  Both albums are still sought after by heavy metal enthusiasts on various record collector websites.  The band's line up at the release of their last album included: Ron McClure on drums, Jerry Rotz & Steve Metzger on guitar, Gary Ottosi played bass on most of the album while Joe Prainito played bass on the songs "Torn", "Flesh Disciple", "Egypt" and "I See". Gena McClure sang vocals for the band.

(2) Born in Xenia, Ohio, 1967, as Matt Basso, this artist has traversed a wide variety of musical endeavors. As a writer and recording artist, he has a very defined style which can be gleaned from his various influences.

Vocally, he has a more edgy vibe than most blues vocalists. His Robert Plant-ish intensity weaves in and out of some very soulful melodies. The guitar work is clearly a mix of Robert Johnson/Blind Willie Johnson slide with some Eric Sardinas for good measure.

Can there be a perfect mix of heavy metal and delta blues? YES !!!  Here it is. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Towne+Cryer">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
