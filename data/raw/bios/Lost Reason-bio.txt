Lost Reason was founded in 2004 by Sascha Abt, Fabian Allwohn and Steffen GÃ¼nther. Because of several shortages and difficulties some resulting changes in the cast of members took place and the band found another adequate guitar player in Falko Schulze.  Only one month later the band's first album ''Fires of Lunacy'' was recorded in their practice room. The planning for the second album ended and the band is about to begin with the recording process soon. After three great gigs in the second half of 2006 the presence on-stage in 2007 shall be augmented and the negotiation for new gigs in clubs and festivals during 2007 already began, and the band is still searching for new locations.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lost+Reason">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
