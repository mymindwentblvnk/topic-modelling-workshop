Grup Şimşek is a fresh and modern super-quintet which performs an electrified and highly danceable set of Turkish music led by Derya Yıldırım’s hypnotizing Saz and vocals. It combines Anatolian Folk and modern grooves, often contaminated by hints of Psychedelia, Jazz and Funk.   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Derya+Y%C4%B1ld%C4%B1r%C4%B1m+&+Grup+%C5%9Eim%C5%9Fek">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
