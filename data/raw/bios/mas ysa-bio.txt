Mas Ysa, the moniker for Thomas Arsenault, a 30-year-old musician and producer from Canada, smoothly blends his raspy vocals with spellbinding whirlwinds of sound on his debut EP, Worth. After spending two years traveling across the globe from the North American continent all the way down to Brazil, Worth serves as Mas Ysa’s musical vessel with 9 cathartic tracks that explore the realms of experimental electronic production.

It’s easy to see why ‘Why’ is the lead single off the EP– the catchy, mind-blowing song is bursting with buoyant energy and beats straight out of the ’80s. These same dazzling techniques are replicated on ‘Shame’, another track that incorporates slices of new wave, electro-pop, techno and even bits of folktronica into the percussion work. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mas+Ysa">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
