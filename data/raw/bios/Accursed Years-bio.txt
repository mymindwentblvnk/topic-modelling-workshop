A folky, melodic death/black metal band from Dorset, England. Providing a bleak, atmospheric, yet fist pumping style of metal influenced by a combination of the European folk, black and melodic death metal scene, and from the more sombre forms of metal from their native land.

Accursed Years was formed in 2013 by Agnieszka "Annie" Bryniarska and Joseph "Joms" Peers. They were later joined in 2014 by Jon Evans, and in 2015 by Rob Innell, Dan Reynolds, and SÃ¸ren Willatzen. 

They take their name from the two thousand years of the first period of Sauron's rule over J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth in the latter part of the Second Age. The name has come to symbolise many things, including the Norman occupation of England from the eyes of an Anglo-Saxon, to the bleak times of depression in life. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Accursed+Years">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
