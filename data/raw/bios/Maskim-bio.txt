Maskim was an Italian Thrash Metal band.
Started in 1980 as Hot Blood, releasing a demo tape.
In 1985, after some line-up changes, the band's name turns into Maskim, changing the sound as well. A demo and a self titled LP and a CD were released between 1988-1992. 1995 saw a new line-up and new style: melodic power metal. An album was programmed but never released.
The band split up in 1996. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Maskim">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
