1. USA metal band

Animist is fresh talent from the spawn of Candlelight Records era Opeth, black metal and melodic death metal. They released a demo/EP in 2012 of 7-15 minute tracks, all guaranteed to cause an adrenaline surge. The tracks are coupled by great composer knowledge, strong rhythms, shifting instrument focus and growled vocals.
