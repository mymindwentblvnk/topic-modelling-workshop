Martin Sandoval, the director of the group, started playing this type of music with his dad and uncles in a group named, Los Aventureros de Nueva Rosita, and it was there, his passion for music began. He first learned to play the electric base.

In May 2000 he decided to leave Los Aventureros to form his own group. Manuel, Martin's brother, and Salome, Martin's cousin, decided to form Agresivo.

Some of the groups influences are Cardenales, Pesado, Tito y Los Reyes del Camino, Tigrillos, Lalo Mora, Invasores and Yahari, to name a few.

The members are from Elgin, TX ( Also known as the Sausage Capitol) which is 30 minutes east of Austin, TX.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Agresivo">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
