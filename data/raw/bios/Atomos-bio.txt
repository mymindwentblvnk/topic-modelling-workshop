Atomos refers to the ancient Greek word άτομος, which marks individuality and indivisibility. The founder of Atomos saxophone quartet, Arvydas Kazlauskas, has gathered a few of the best young saxophone players in Latvia - Aigars Raumanis, Jānis Puķītis and Eduards Lācis. Each member is a known successful musician of his generation. Founded in summer 2016, Rīga, Latvia-based Atomos is on its way in the search of new artistic paths while presenting a fresh sound and quality music to today's audience. Besides the original saxophone quartet repertoire, the members are continuously working on their own arrangements of non-saxophone pieces, Vocalises by Jānis Ivanovs being just one example of high-quality Latvian music, that has never been performed before by a saxophone quartet.
