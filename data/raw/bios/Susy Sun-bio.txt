Susy Sun is a classically-trained pianist and singer/songwriter from the Pacific Northwest. She performs piano compositions with a sweet voice which contradicts her edgy, honest lyrics. Often accompanied by a full band, the result is a strong, sultry sound that demands your attention and makes for playful live shows that mesmerize audiences everywhere.

Her childhood was filled with music lessons. By her teens she was already an accomplished classical pianist, writing her own lyrics to accompany her original compositions. Infused with honest accounts of her personal experiences, the combination of her piano sounds and lyrics demonstrate a deep connection to the earth, and a playful, free spirit that loves to roam it. 

Aside from exploring her own Native American and Swedish culture, Susy Sun has taught music in London, worked at a farm in Greece, and studied Spanish in Spain. Her travels confirmed that she would never be content brushing off her musical dreams, and after a few years of cubicle life, she dropped the corporate world to pursue her biggest passion. 

Appropriately titled, Wanderlust (Fall 2013) is her second album. Engineered by Shawn Simmons, (The Head and The Heart, Lemolo, and The Maldives), Wanderlust features the Passenger String Quartet led by Andrew Joslyn (Macklemore, Duff Mckagan, Mark Lanegan, Kris Orlowski), resulting in a riveting chamber pop sound that has captured audiences of all genres and ages.
