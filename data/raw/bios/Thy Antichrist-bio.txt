Thy Antichrist rises in August of 1998 on Medellin, Colombia a Black Metal project called Thy Antichrist, at that time the band was playing a way primitive and raw music.

Thy Antichrist is a band created and sustained on the Neo-Satanism bases, in the solidity of itâ€™s criterion and ideologic judgement, far away from the fucking trifles of the laughable pseudo-satanism. Likewise the band is not tied to the childish way of thinking referring to a satanic doctrine as a religious system, being this one a really big and erroneous contradiction.

Thy Antichrist symbolizes the denial of the submission to any deity or religious system; it just looks for the primeval conciense of man like his own God or his own Satan if so is wanted Ad Libitum.
