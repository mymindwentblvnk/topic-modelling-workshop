Discobitch is a French electronic music group, consisting of two dj's/producers: Kylian Mash and Laurent Konrad. Their single "C'est beau la bourgeoisie" with vocalist Pauline Sampeur was released on August 25, 2008 and became a hit single in France. The name of the group was puzzled together out of two bootlegs: "Bitch" and "Discotron". On the request of the group, winemaker Champagne Tarlant branded a champagne cuv√©e with the Discobitch name. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Discobitch">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
