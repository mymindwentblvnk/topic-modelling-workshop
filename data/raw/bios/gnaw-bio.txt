Gnaw is an experimental drone / noise band from New York City, New York, United States formed in 2006 by Alan Dubin.

Gnaw is a New York City noise/metal band created by Alan Dubin after the dissolution of Khanate and consisting of guitarist Brian Beatrice, multi-instrumentalist Carter Thornton, drummer Eric Neuser and sound designer Jun Mizumachi. In addition to the traditional 4 piece rock format and string and wind instruments, Gnaw utilizes found sound, home made instruments, tweaked oscillators, synthesis and manipulated recordings. The Wire magazine called Gnaw "a terrifying rock sextet whose blackened vision has enough dark energy to blot out the sun" and described Gnaw's debut album, This Face, to be "unsettling but vital listening".

About their sophomore album, released by Seventh Rule Recordings, Cvlt Nation claims, “Few bands have managed to pull off such a seamless and triumphant splicing of doom metal, noise and industrial as GNAW have managed to do with this album, and in this extremely unique, surreal and particular world the band dwells in, Horrible Chamber represents hands down industrial doom’s finest hour of 2013.”
