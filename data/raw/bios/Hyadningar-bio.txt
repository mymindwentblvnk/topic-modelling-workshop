Hyadningar was a French black metal band formed in June 2001 from Rouen, France. The original line-up was composed of Marquis (vocals), Eurynome (guitar, choirs), Heimdall (guitar), Nekurat (bass guitar), and Turannos (drums).

The first available recording was a live split with Ataraxie called Live in Rouen in 2001. The second release was the demo Hymns of a Forgotten Past, which was recorded and mixed in three days at Kalifornia Studio in 2003 at Rouen.

In February 2004, Hyadningar and Heimdall separated by mutual agreement after the recording of the song Our Fall Into Oblivion. After four months of search and audition, Nehluj joined the quartet in June 2004.

The band released two LPs entitled Imminent Useless Soul (2006) and The Weak Creation (2009) before splitting up in 2010.
