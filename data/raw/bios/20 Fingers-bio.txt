20 Fingers is the name of a musical group popular in the early 1990's for producing a series of novelty pop music and rap music songs.
Numerous singers affiliated with this group had hits on their own, most notably Gillette who scored hits with "Short, Short Man" and "Mr. Personality".
Another 20 Fingers spin-off resulted in the club hit "Lick It".

20 Fingers is known for its occasionally sexually explicit lyrics, which has resulted in some songs being released in
censored and uncensored versions (for example, Gillette's "Short, Short Man" is entitled "Short Dick Man" in its uncensored version.
"Lick It", similarly, had both edited and unedited versions released.
