Evolution of Discord started on the summer of 2006, it contains members from local South Bay metal bands Denounce His Name and Torch the Day, bands that no longer exist. They believe the world is constanly in discord and try to spread a message of peace through death metal. Evolution of Discord has not played that many shows on its first year, even though the few shows they had were impressive and they have played with bands such as Terry Funk, The Ghost Inside(ex-A Dying Dream), Katsumoto, and Letlive. Now that the band belives they're ready to play; shows should be coming up soon, and they should be amazing since the band keeps picking up listeners after every show, and the old DHN and TTD fans still follow their idols. They are currently recording a demo which should be released by the end of the year(?). Evolution of Discord has the folowing formation:

Justin Moore(Vocals)
Eric Netto(Bass)
Sigel Candia(Guitar)
Doug Tafoya(Guitar)
Morgan Lester(Drums) <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Evolution+Of+Discord">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
