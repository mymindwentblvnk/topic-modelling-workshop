"Neangeli" is a pop duet from Ukraine. Their first appearance was in 2006 with the single "You're One Of Those". After two weeks it became a hit. Because of the music video of this song, they were invited to decorate the cover of July's Playboy issue. Their second single "Jura, Forgive Me" became the national anthem. It brought them two awards. In December 2006 the band released their debut album “Number One”.
