Zomboy is Joshua Mellody, a sound engineer whose aggressive, bloodthirsty tracks range from stadium-ready dubstep to drum'n'bass and electro-house. Born in a small town near Cornwall, England called Penzance, Mellody came to America, where he worked in recording and engineering before returning to the U.K. After releasing some electro tracks -- mostly cover versions -- under the name Place Your Bet$, Mellody moved back to Guildford, U.K., put his love of Skrillex and Rusko into his work, and became the dubstep artist Zomboy, the name inspired by the video game Left for Dead. He kicked life off as Zomboy in 2011 with the Game Time EP, released by the label Never Say Die. With the EP spending eight weeks as one of Beatport's Top Five dubstep releases, Zomboy charted next to his idols on the online music retailer's charts, and by the end of the year, his music and remixes were licensed to compilations on labels like Warner and Ministry of Sound. The Dead Symphonic EP followed in 2012, and single "Kick It" appeared the same year. Single "Here to Stay" (featuring Lady Chann) was issued by Firepower Records in 2013, and two-part EP Reanimated was released by Never Say Die and sister label No Tomorrow later in the year. Never Say Die also released Zomboy's debut full-length The Outbreak in 2014, as well as its 2015 remix album Resurrected. The Neon Grave EP appeared on the label in 2016. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Zomboy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
