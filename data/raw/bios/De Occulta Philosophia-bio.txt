A symphonic black metal band from Italy. They are one of the first bands in the world who started to play this genre. Many of today's Italian (and other) symphonic black metal bands have been influenced by this band's one and only demo release called "Obscura Simphonia." It was recorded in 1995 and features top-notch symphonic elements (considering that symphonic black metal was an almost unknown genre by then) and great recording quality.
