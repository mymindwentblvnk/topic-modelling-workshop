-Symbolik's "Pathogenesis" winter 2011 EP was recorded and mixed by Bob Swanson of Mayhemeness Recording Studio in Sacramento, CA. The "Pathogenesis" album artwork is an original piece of art drawn by Mark Cooper of MindRape Art, as well as the new 2011 Symbolik Logo!

Symbolik began in mid- 2007 with Vocalist Chris Blackburn and Guitarist Allen Burton coming together with a common goal to create a truly unique style in the midst of today's saturated market of mundane musicality. A year and a half later in the spring of 2009 with 5 solid members in tact and some demo recordings done with the help of Smoke You Productions they began playing a barrage of shows around the central valley. After a year solid of playing shows around the area issues began to rise between members causing the parting of ways of then bassist (Jeremy Norman) in fall of 2010. At that point Daniel Juarez (ex-Rings of Saturn, From the Dead) stepped in with his ferocious 6-string bass tapping skills to take full control of the low end frequencies of Symbolik. Then shortly after in summer of 2011 rhythm guitarist (Fred Powell) and drummer (Alexis Salazar) removed themselves from the band because of personal issues, but still respect and maintain friendships with the band members to this day. Immediately after this Guitarist John Sangalang stepped in to complete the rhythm section and Drummer Brandon "billy the kid" Clevenstine to complete the perfect metal machine that was intended for Symbolik. With this new powerhouse lineup combined with an all new aggression Symbolik will be laying waste to your cities and corrupting your youth long before you ever see it coming!  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Symbolik">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
