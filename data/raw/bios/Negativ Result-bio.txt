Originally formed in 2005 by Brendan and Ian and called Negativ the band went through a few rhythm guitarists and more then a few bassists before finally finding what works with Brendan, Ian, Colin and the newest member Steve on bass. After discovering there was already band called Negative in Northern Europe the decision was made to change the name to Negativ Result and hase been so for the last 3 years.

Gigging around Ireland and building up a name and reputation in a metal scene that seems to be fading away didnâ€™t stop Negativ Result pushing forward with their new material and heavy thrash sound with influences from Lamb Of God, Pantera, Machinehead, Metallica and Slayer to name only a few.

Now with their newly recorded E.P. and thirst for all that is METAL Negativ Result are pushing the boundaries of metal in Ireland and making people stand up and pay attention. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Negativ+Result">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
