Despite deriving their name from a Nirvana  song, Greece's Negative Creeps owe nothing (save perhaps their depressed nature) to the sounds of '90s Seattle. Instead, they draw inspiration for their brutalizing hardcore/speed metal hybrid from the likes of Mot√∂rhead  and Biohazard. Formed in the early '90s by singer Makis Kanakaris, guitarist John Boulamakis, bassist George Katsaitis, and drummer Tomek Solomonidis, the band gradually developed its so-called "Satancore" over the ensuing decade before finally debuting with 1999's 999 opus. The aptly named Satancore  EP from 2001 introduced further hardcore posturing and nu-metal sonic tendencies, with mixed results. And after signing with Black Lotus Records, the band released its sophomore In Uterus Rebirth in 2002, then set out on the road with Biohazard  and Rotting Christ.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Negative+Creeps">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
