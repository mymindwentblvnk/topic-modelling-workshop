Doomsword is an epic heavy/doom metal band from Italy. Founded in 1997 by Deathmaster (previously a member of the metal band Agarthi), the band released their first demo the same year, before going on to release five albums (as of February 2011) mixing the slow, heavy sound of doom metal with the folk-like and battle driven sounds of viking metal to create the musical sound of a battlefield.
