Glorian shares the name of two bands - the turkish one (founded by Ahmet Ucankus and Hakan Kul in 1995) and the bulgarian composer Borislav Slavov (also known as Bobby Slavov, http://www.music-marks.com/), who made the music for the popular computer games "Knights of Honor" and Crysis 2. He, as a founder of "Music-Marks" participated in making soundtracks to various TV and radio programmes, but Glorian works mostly in the computer game business. 
His name stands next to Knights of Honour, WorldShift (both from Black Sea Studios), Eschalon: Book I, Larva Mortus and other.
