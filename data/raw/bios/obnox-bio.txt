Obnox is a solo project of Lamont "Bim" Thomas.  Lamont "Bim" Thomas is a staple of the Ohio North Coast's evolving rock scene, most notably atop a drum throne in This Moment in Black History. As OBNOX, Thomas takes full reins, tackling vocals, guitars and drums on a feral mix of tunes collected as I'm Bleeding Now. A limited edition release of 500 vinyl copies with full-color, two-sided insert arrived in June from Smog Veil Records, and a digital copy is now available on iTunes.
