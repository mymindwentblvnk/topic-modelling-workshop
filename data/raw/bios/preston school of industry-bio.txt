Preston School of Industry is a Seattle indie rock band formed by Scott Kannberg (aka Spiral Stairs) in 1999, following the dissolution of his previous band, Pavement.

In 2001, Preston School of Industry released All This Sounds Gas, which was recorded mainly in Stockton, California. The album is said to be comprised of the songs that were rejected by Pavement on their final album, Terror Twilight. The band released its second album, Monsoon, in 2004, with studio contributions from members of The Minus 5 and Wilco.

Preston School of Industry went inactive after their September 2004 Australian tour, though Kannberg revealed in late 2006 he had been slowly working on a record: "Don't know when it's going to be released. Just taking my time, nothing special. I've got the songs, I just haven't figured out how I want to do it yet. This winter, I'll probably get it done." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Preston+School+of+Industry">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
