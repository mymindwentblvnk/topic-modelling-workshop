Psyche are a Canadian dark synth pop band that's currently based in Germany. Originally founded in 1982 by Darrin Huss with his brother Stephen Huss, briefly including Dwayne Goettel, the group is now centered around Darrin Campbell Huss himself, who remains the only constant member through its history. Collaborations exist with David Kristian, Per-Anders Kurenbach, and Remi Szyszka, all recording albums with Darrin under the name Psyche. To date, Psyche have released 11 official full length albums, 1 DVD entitled 'Imaginary Life', and several compilations.

Some examples of their best known songs are "Brain Collapses", "Unveiling the Secret, "Eternal", "Misery", "Tears", "Sanctuary", "Gods and Monsters", "15 Minutes", and a remake of "Goodbye Horses", the cult Q Lazzarus song made famous by its use in the psychological thriller film 'The Silence of the Lambs'. Other popular covers include versions of "Sex Dwarf" (by Soft Cell') and "Disorder" (by Joy Division).

As of the last 30 years since their debut in the early 80s, Psyche continue to record and perform their unique blend of dark electronic music throughout Europe as well as many territories around the world.

*Note: 

In the early 90s, the name Psyche was also used as an alias of Detroit techno artist Carl Craig. Under this early pseudonym the legendary Detroit based techno producer released a few 12"s on Transmat - later compiled onto 'Elements', alongside other material written under his BFC alias, and released on Craig's own Planet E label.

Also, a short lived west coast Scottish new wave/rock band called Psyche released a 7" single in 1982. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Psyche">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
