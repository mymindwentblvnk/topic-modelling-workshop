History

It took quite a while for the first idea behind Rauta to progress into an actual song. After almost two years of thinking and talking about it, we finally formed the band and started writing material in late 2003. The band members were all already familiar to us from other band situations, so the actual forming of the band came easy. From there, things have taken a natural course towards our debut album "Haudanmaa".

Influence

All of us have considerable mileage as musicians, and thus have our musical influences changed over the years. The road has taken us from freejazz to classical to folk to metal and so on, so it's hard to name any one type of music that makes Rauta what it is. Originally, the idea was to crossbreed folk and metal, but - as it turns out - it's become more like progressive rock meets ethno. True-metal purists beware :D

Writing

Most of the songs have been written by Aki Hauru (guitar) and Laura Airola (violin, nyckelharpa), Laura being responsible for the lyrics. Today and more so in the future, we plan to incorporate the rest of the band more into composing and especially arranging the material. Actually, we see little difference in composition and arranging. They're all a part of the package and the whole of a song has to be in mind right from the start.

Lyrics

The lyrics would of course be best left for the audience to interpret, but here goes: The themes revolve around a certain critisism against progress and the decadence of modern western society, and on the other hand lean heavily on longing for nature. Also, a strong presence of finnish folklore can be found. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rauta">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
