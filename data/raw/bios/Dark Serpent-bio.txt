Fast, heavy & intense balls-crushing metal is what Dark Serpent delivers as the main course in their mutilating buffet. DS was formed in ’97 by Giardello Caravagio (Lead guitar)and Uri “Kaos” Shalev (Rhythm guitar/ Vocals) with only one intention in their minds: Creating and playing some good ol’ old school thrash metal, a rare commodity at that time. The band played some small gigs and recorded their first EP on 2000 (Siatha De’shmaya), but it wasn’t until ’05 that the band felt it was time to start pushing their music to the next level. With the addition of bass player and killer back vocalist Zahi Berkowitz, the band transformed from a mostly fun driven, pass-time project to a force to be reckoned with at the now growing Israeli metal scene. Playing bigger venues in Israel and developing their unique, cynical, humor drenched & intense performance style, DS gained more popularity and became the face of Israel’s thrash metal scene. In 2006 the band entered the studio to record their debut album, but the outcome was not to the band's satisfaction and the first attempt was not released. Cutting their losses, the trio concentrated on manning the frequently changing drummer position. In 2010, a drummer by the name of Yuval 'BoolBool' Tamir was found and the band could continue their studio work, this time with the immeasurable aid of producer and friend Yuval Kramer (Amaseffer). 2011 sees the release of their debut album, M.K.C (Abbr. for Mass Killing Convention), a non-compromising must have album for all you die hard thrashers out there!  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dark+Serpent">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
