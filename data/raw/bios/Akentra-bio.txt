This Rock Metal Gothic band, created in 2006 by Lucia Ferreira, Steve Tilmant and Stephane Rayot, owes it's name to a carnivorous plant. Akentra's music is made up of a strong rhythmic section, sharp guitars sounds and Lucia's strong feminine voice carrying lyrics tainted with darkness and melancholy. 

The warm welcome they received when they went on stage made their desire grow and has given them the urge to want to push themselves further onto the muscial scene.

Akentra relied on Didier Chesneau and Aymeric Ribot (Headline, Invictus, Mylidian) in order to record their first EP "IV.IV.IV.

The line-up complements itself with the arrival of two guitarists, Thomas Boileux and Habib Mas, what allows the group to end the writing of the first album. March 2010, Akentra enters the Dome tudio with David Potvin (Lyzanxia, One-Way Mirror, Phaze I) for the recording of "Asleep", which will be released on October 10th, 2010. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Akentra">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
