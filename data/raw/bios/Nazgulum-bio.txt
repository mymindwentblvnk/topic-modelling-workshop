Nazgulum started up in spring 2003 with the line up of Satanic Warrior and Diabolic Horseman (they were 13). The project positioned itself as true black metal. Some demo stuff was recorded. Then followed a split-release with the band Мракобесие on the label Trinity Production. Guitarist Luciferic Lumberman and bassist Concrete Joe joined the band. Nazgulum are constantly playing with their musical style - performing for example black metal, acoustic or sludge sets
