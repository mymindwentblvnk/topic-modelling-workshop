Pussyvibes is a Grindcore band from Portugal. In the beginning, the band was only a side project with the aid of a computer to program the drum kit and record the remaining instruments. This lead to the Demo "Can U Smell It?" was self-released in 2000. All the tracks were played and vocalized by Nelson, with the exception of the track Demented, Depraved and Idle where Bruno lent his vocal skills. 

Years later in 2006, the band was reformed. However, members were foundreforming the band to a full-time project. They've played every corner of Portugal, from small clubs to festivals sharing the stage with bands like Napalm Death,  Haemorrhage,  Sublime Cadaveric Decomposition,  Cock and Ball Torture,  Jig-Ai,  Mucupurulent,  Holocausto Canibal,  Fetal Incest,  Raw Decimating Brutality and  Namek.
