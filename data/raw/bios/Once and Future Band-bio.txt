Joel Robinow (keyboards/guitar/vocals), Raj Ojha (drums/recording engineer) and Eli Eckert (bass/guitar/vocals) have been confidantes and conspirators for over a decade, collaborating in Drunk Horse, Howlin Rain, East Bay Grease and many other projects.

They have convened as "Once and Future Band" with the purpose of performing and recording Joel's massive library of songs before they are lost to the ages after the Great Hard Drive Crash of '12. Songs that weave woozy psychedelics, deep pocket grooves and heart-worn melodies to create expansive harmonic vistas suitable for lining up the family in front of and take the goddamn picture already. Grand Canyon jams.

When you first experience Once and Future sounds, you may begin aiming at the dartboard of Familiar Musical ReferencesTM. When every dart is thrown and you find that none have reached their target, a profound sense of confusion may arise: How can I be familiar with all of this and perhaps not know it at all? A potent lungful of Nostalgia invades the blood and brain, yet you are not sealed in a hyperbaric time capsule with a bunch of moldy records. No, your body begins to move to the warping rhythms as you wrestle with these contradictions and realize that none of them matter.
