1. Lawrence Franks, Jr. (September 12, 1988-June 25, 2020), better known by his stage name Huey was an American rapper from St. Louis, Missouri. He was best known for his single "Pop, Lock & Drop It", which peaked at #6 on the Billboard Hot 100, from the album Notebook Paper.

Huey has been making music since his baby years. He was introduced to music veteran Angela Richardson by his brother, and when Richardson set up a new rap group, Huey featured prominently, with songs such as "Oh" and "Zip, take out & suck it", becoming local favorites among DJs and promoters. Huey featured on a series of mixtapes, one of which, Unsigned Hype, sold out of its run of 8,000 copies and was noticed by producer TJ Chapman, who introduced the rapper to Vice President of A&R at Jive Records, Mickey "MeMpHiTz" Wright, in 2006. In March 2010 his new video and first single "Hello to all my haters" for his new album "So St. Louis" was released, the single is also available on iTunes.
