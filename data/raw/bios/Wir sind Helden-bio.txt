Wir sind Helden (English translation: "We are heroes") was a well known German rock act formed 2000 in Hamburg, Germany. In 2003 they were among the first bands to kick off a still ongoing trend for up tempo rock songs sung in German. Examples of other successful bands following that trend are Juli and Silbermond, a wave of bands referred to by the media as the 'NDW2', the second 'Neue Deutsche Welle' or ('New German Wave'). The first wave brought fame to artists like Nena, in the 1980s.

The four members of the band are Judith Holofernes, Jean-Michel Tourette, Mark Tavassol and Pola Roy.  They met during the Kontaktstudiengang Popmusik, a study program in Hamburg, Germany. 

The group released four studio albums: Die Reklamation (2003), Von hier an blind (2005), Soundso (2007) and, finally, Bring mich nach Hause (2010).

It was a band tradition to play a concert in the German town of Helden as part of every tour.

In April 2012 the band announced its 'indefinite hiatus'.
