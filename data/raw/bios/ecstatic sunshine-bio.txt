Ecstatic Sunshine is an ongoing musical project that began in 2005 as a guitar duo comprised of Matthew Papich and Dustin Wong (who has since left the project to pursue Ponytail and his own solo guitar musics). Ecstatics has released 3 LPs and 2 EPs since that time and has performed hundreds of shows in the United States and Europe with a revolving group of players. Currently, Ecstatics live performances are solo endeavors by Papich. Throughout the years the essence of Ecstatic Sunshine has been located within Papich’s unique guitar work, however the shifting cast has allowed Ecstatics to spread it’s reach effortlessly into new lands. Echoes of punk, ambient, reggae and techno have floated in and out of Ecstatic’s sound, though never feeling contrived and never supplanting the energy or vision of the original output.
