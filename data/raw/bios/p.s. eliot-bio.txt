P.S. Eliot was an American pop-punk band formed in 2007 in Birmingham, Alabama by twin sisters Katie Crutchfield (guitars, vocals) (who subsequently records as Waxahatchee) and Allison Crutchfield (drums) (who subsequently records as Swearin'), together with Will Granger on guitar, and Katherine Simonetti on bass. Counting bands such as Bikini Kill, Xray Spex, Fugazi and the Raincoats amongst their influences, the explicitly feminist band released two albums: Introverted Romance In Our Troubled Minds (2009) and Sadie (2011), both on Salinas Records. 

While playing in P.S. Eliot, the Crutchfield sisters also both played in Bad Banana. Katie Crutchfield also recorded solo under the name King Everything.

After the band broke up in 2011, the Crutchfield sisters pursued their own musical projects: Katie Crutchfield started Waxahatchee and Allison Crutchfield started Swearin'. 

The band briefly reunited in June 2016 for a tour, which took place the following September. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/P.S.+Eliot">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
