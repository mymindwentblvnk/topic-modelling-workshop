Saprogenic formed in 2001 in Detroit, Michigan.  Their first CD, The Wet Sound of Flesh on Concrete was released on Deepsend Records in 2003.  Their newest album Ichneumonid, came out in 2006, and was put out by Forever Underground Records.

The band plays extremely fast, brutal death metal, but one of the highlighting factors with fans seems to be their strange use of melody and tone.  Unlike most brutal death metal bands, Saprogenic played guitar in the tremolo style on their debut, creating an almost black metal sound in the guitars.  This is contrasted with most brutal death bands utilizing technical slam riffs, etc. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Saprogenic">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
