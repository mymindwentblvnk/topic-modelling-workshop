The TALETELLERS were formed in the Summer of 2005 out of the ashes of the Rock 'n Roll band Taletellers Soulsellers, which won a lot of band contests and played a lot of concerts in the local club scene.

Alan Costa (vocals and guitars) from the original line-up teamed up with former band manager Holger Zenner (drums), Pascal Louis (bass) and Stefan Kuhn (guitars) to form the TALETELLERS. Holger Zenner left the band in early March 2006, being replaced on drums by Ben Graf.

The TALETELLERS entered the studio in late March 2006 and the debut EP "The Missiles of Mercy" was finally released in December 2006. 

During 2007 the band continued to play live and began to write songs for a full length album. Ben Graf left the band in May 2007 and a new drummer was found in Sebastian Berg. In October 2007 the band entered once again SU2 Studios in Illingen, Germany (Powerwolf, Vendetta, Autumnblaze). The result is "Detonator" which is the first full length album of TALETELLERS and will be released in early 2008. Just as the cover art of "The Missiles of Mercy" the artwork for Detonator was once again designed by Mark Wilkinson (Judas Priest Painkiller)!  

TALETELLERS - an insane symbiosis of Thrash Metal, 1980's Heavy Metal and Rock n' Roll.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Taletellers">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
