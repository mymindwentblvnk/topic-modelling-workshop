Lagum is a Brazilian pop and reggae band formed in 2014 in the city of Brumadinho, Minas Gerais. It is composed by Pedro Calais, Otavio Cardoso, Jorge, Francisco Jardim and formerly Tio Wilson.

It all started in 2014, in the city of Belo Horizonte, when Pedro Calais decided to post a video of one of his compositions on Facebook; a friend who was the promoter of events at a concert hall saw him and encouraged him to form a band to perform at the venue. Therefore, Calais decided to call his childhood friends Otavio Cardoso, Glauco Borges, Francisco Jardim and Breno Braga. The group started their career performing at this concert hall in the city, playing their own songs, which are credited to all of the band.

In May 2016, the quintet released their debut studio album titled Seja o Que Eu Querer. In February 2018, an acoustic version of the song "Deixa" was released in partnership with singer Ana Gabriela. The song, in this version, became a success, being among the most played in the country, giving visibility to the group to participate in television programs and sign a contract with the Sony record company. In June 2019, they released their second studio album named Things of the Generation.


On September 12, 2020, the band would perform two shows in drive-in format in the city of Nova Lima, Minas Gerais. However, drummer Tio Wilson (Breno Braga) had an indisposition in the interval between the two performances and died from a cardiorespiratory arrest. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lagum">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
