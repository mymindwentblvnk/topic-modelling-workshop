SERMON OF HYPOCRISY HAVE BEEN LURKING AMONGST THE DARK SHADOWS OF THE UK BLACK METAL SCENE SINCE THE TURN OF THIS MILLENIUM HAVING LEFT NO LESS THAN 10 EX MEMBERS IN THEIR WAKE. SOH CRAWLED FROM THE FILTH AND BEGAN THEIR REIGN OF TERROR IN LATE SUMMER 1999 WHEN FOUNDING MEMBERS 'DIESEKTOR' (VOCALS) AND 'SYN' (GUITARS) FORMED THE BAND WITH THE INTENT OF CREATING EXTREME BLACK/DEATH METAL PRIMARALY INFLUENCED BY MAYHEM, DARKTHRONE, EMPEROR, DARK FUNERAL AND MORBID ANGEL AMONG OTHERS. THE BAND THEN TOOK ON FIRST DRUMMER JAMIE 'BOGGY' SYKES (ATAVIST, THE ENCHANTED, BURNING WITCH, THORS HAMMER) WHO REHEARSED FOR A FEW SHORT MONTHES BEFORE BEEN REPLACED BY 'STORM' (BAL SAGOTH, AXIS OF PERDITION, THINE), SHORTLY THERAFTER BASSIST 'Z' HAADUM' (THINE, BLACK MARIA, IRON VOID) WAS RECRUITED. NOW WITH A FULL LINE UP THE BAND PERFORMED THEIR FIRST LIVE SHOWS WITH THE LIKES OF; AKERCOCKE, DESECRATION, GOREROTTED, HECATE ENTHRONED AND HEATHEN DEITY, IN LATE 2000 SECOND GUITARIST 'WRAITH' (NAILED) WAS BROUGHT ONBOARD TO FLESH OUT THE LIVE SOUND. THROUGHOUT 2001 SOH PLAYED SEVERAL SHOWS INCLUDING THE ANNUAL 'DUNGEONFEST' IN BRADFORD. IN NOVEMBER THAT YEAR LONG STANDING BASS PLAYER 'MORBIUS' JOINED THE BAND REPLACING THE NOW DEPARTED 'Z' HAADUM', IN NOT TO LONG A TIME THE BAND WAS ALSO JOINED BY KEYBOARD PLAYER 'SICKWAVE'. DURING 2002 THE BAND ENTERED 'SOUNDSFINE' STUDIOS WITH PRODUCER STUART ANSTIS (EX CRADLE OF FILTH) TO RECORD THEIR FIRST SELF FINANCED E.P. 'TO BURN WHAT HE CREATES'. FOLLOWING THE RECORDING 'SICKWAVE' WAS DISMISSED DUE TO MUSICAL AND IDEOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES AND SHORTLY AFTER THIS 'WRAITH WAS TO DEPART TO JOIN LOCAL DEATH METALLERS 'NAILED'. SOH CONTINUED AS A FOUR PIECE AND WASTED LITTLE TIME WRITING AND COMPILING SONGS FOR A FOLLOW UP E.P. ENTITLED 'MASOCHISTIC DISCIPLIN', RECORDING TOOK PLACE AT 'STARFADE' STUDIOS DURING THE SUMMER OF 2003 WITH PRODUCTION BEING HANDLED BY BROOKE AND MIKE OF 'AXIS OF PERDITION', ONLY 100 COPIES WERE MADE AVAILABLE BEING DISTRIBUTED MAINLY TO RECORD LABELS AND UNDERGROUND DISTIBUTERS INCLUDING 'GRINDETHIC' RECORDS. UPON COMPLETING THE RECORDING SOH HEADLINED THE 2ND 'BLACK ECLIPSE' FESTIVAL PERFORMING A TRIUMPHANT SET CONSISTING OF BOTH NEW AND OLD SONGS. DESPITE GAINING A POSITIVE RESPONSE TO THE NEW E.P. FROM BOTH FANS AND PRESS THERE FOLLOWED A PERIOD OF INACTIVITY FOLLOWED IN JANUARY 2004 BY THE SHOCK DEPARTURE OF DRUMMING SUPREMO 'STORM'. AFTER LONG MONTHS AUDITIONING PROSPECTIVE REPLACEMENTS THE BAND PLAYED 2 SHOWS WITH 'CORPSEHAMMER' (ASOMVEL) FILLING THE VACANT THRONE BEFORE AQUIRING THE SERVICES OF 'INFERMUM' (NEOPHYTE). IN NOVEMBER 2004 THIS NEW INCARNATION PERFORMED THEIR FIRST SHOW AT BRADFORD 'RIOS' SUPPORTING DEATH METAL LEGENDS 'SUFFOCATION', IMMEDIATLY AFTERWARDS THE BAND PARTED COMPANY WITH CO-FOUNDING MEMBER 'SYN'. THE REMAINING MEMBERS REFUSED THE LAY DOWN AND DIE AND RECRUITED TWO NEW GUITARISTS 'BAAL' AND 'LEVIATHAN', LIVE SHOWS FOLLOWED IN EARLY 2005, INCLUDING THE 'MIDWINTER METALFEST' IN COVENTRY WHERE SOH APPEARED ALONG SUPREME LORD 'ABGOTT', LATER THAT YEAR BOTH 'BAAL' AND 'LEVIATHAN' WERE SHOWN THE EXIT DOOR. HOWEVER THIS WAS NOT TO BE THE END, FAR FROM IT!, IN A SUPRISE MOVE TO MANY VOCALIST AND FOUNDING MEMBER 'DIESEKTOR' SWITCHED OVER TO GUITAR AND BACKING VOCALS. SEPTEMBER 2005 SAW THE BAND RECRUIT 'AGONISTAS' ON LEAD GUITAR AND VOCALIST 'VILE' (BLACK MARIA, DISPOSAL OF MAN). THE FIRST SHOW WAS SCHEDULED FOR THE FOLLOWING OCTOBER SUPPORTING THE LEGANDARY 'DEICIDE' BUT DUE TO INFURYATING CIRCUMSTANCES THIS NEVER TRANSPIRED. THIS NEW MORE FORMIDIBLE LINE UP FINALLY MADE THEIR DEBUT AT THE 'COCKPIT' IN LEEDS ON SATURDAY 12TH OF NOVEMBER, ALONGSIDE 'NAILED' AND 'THE BELONGING'. THE BAND ARE CURRENTLY PREPARING TO UNLEASH THEIR LONG AWAITED DEBUT ALBUM 'HUMAN HATE MACHINE', TO BE MADE AVAILABLE VIA 'GRINDETHIC' RECORDS....................THE LEGACY CONTINUES. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sermon+of+Hypocrisy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
