Mythodea is a symphonic/progressive metal project created by Christos Nikolaou from Greece. Christos has always had a passion for music and has openly cultivated this since childhood with many influences: from classical baroque music and soundtracks to progressive metal. Mythodea's artistic vision is to take the listeners on a musical journey through deep emotional landscapes and themes that are easily relatable. In the course of this journey, the listener will feel elevated by the way the music is delivered. The musical backbone is an original approach to the mix of the symphonic and heavy metal elements, which makes Mythodea sound quite unique. To fully achieve this vision, Christo's carefully assembled some of the most talented and dedicated musicians in the progressive metal scene: John West on Vocals, Charlie Zeleny (drums), Steve DiGiorgio (Bass),Vitalij Kuprij (accoustic piano), Mistheria (synth solos) and many more to Join. All Music Composed and Orchestrated By Christos Nikolaou. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mythodea">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
