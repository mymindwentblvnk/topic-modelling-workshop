LGHTNNG is an electronic popgroup from Groningen, The Netherlands. LGHTNNG is inspired by as well 80's popculture as contemporary pop and consists of 3 absolute POP lovers/nerds. Always looking for new songs and sounds.

All of LGHTNNG members are genuine pop song lovers, always searching for old and new songs to feed their craving. They aim to achieve a certain level of quality in their songs, high enough for others to feed the same addiction with songs written, recorded and produced by LGTHNNG. 

LGHTNNG was formed in winter 2014. All members have had their fair share of experience in more guitar driven bands such as We Swim You Jump, Rococo and Jimmy Barock. Influenced by the new retro electronic pop sound like Chromatics and Electric Youth, but also bigger names such as Madonna and Depeche Mode, the LGHTNNG esthetic is simple; making electronic songs with the right sound and atmosphere. Sometimes slow and melancholic, sometimes uplifting and danceable.
