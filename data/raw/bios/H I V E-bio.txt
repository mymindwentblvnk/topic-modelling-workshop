Hailing from Chicago, Illinois, USA, H I V E brings forth immensely heavy, down-tuned Deathcore with polyrhythmic nuances. After a decade worth of gaining and losing momentum with previous acts, the strings section came together in the winter of 2015, vocals soon thereafter and finally drums. Operating alongside like minded personalities with similar passion for dark progressive metal amongst other genres, H I V E was formed. The guys released thier first 4 track EP December 2016 and went on the first 30 day national tour as H I V E in May 2017. Then again trekking out to the west coast and back In September 2017. H I V E is writing, demoing, fine-tuning, and growing super ecstatic to release new music early 2018.
