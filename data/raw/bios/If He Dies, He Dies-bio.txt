In the beginning in the depths of Middle Earth, there was Teagan, the One, who in the land of Skeetown is called Teagan Reagan; and she first made IFFY, the holy ones, that were the offspring of her thought, and they were with her before aught else was made. And she spoke to them, propounding to them themes of music; and they created metal before her, and she was glad. But for a long while they thrashed only each alone, for each comprehended only that part of the mind of Teagan from which he came, and in the understanding of their brethren they grew. Yet ever as they listened they came to deeper understanding, and increased in unison and harmony. Then the voices of IFFY, like unto harps and lutes, and pipes and trumpets, and viols and organs, and like unto countless choirs singing with words, began to fashion the theme of Teagan to great music; great metal; Never since has one yet to match the pure, unadulterated grace of what was known as IF HE DIES HE DIES... IF HE DIES HE DIES has shared the stage w/acts such as: EYEHATEGOD, Mastodon, The Black Dahlia Murder and more. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/If+He+Dies,+He+Dies">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
