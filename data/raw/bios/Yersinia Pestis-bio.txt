1) Yersinia Pestis was born in september 2004 as Chris and Stephan started to record some songs together. They were both playing in several death- and thrash-metal bands for about ten years as vocalist/bassist and guitarist. But dark electronic music has always been an important influence.
The sound of Yersinia Pestis can be described as hard but melodic EBMwith distorted english and german vocals. In november 2004 the first demo-cd, "Sector Alpha" was released and in march 2005 they played their first live-gig at the Dark-Rabbit-Festival II in Frankfurt together with Blutzukker, Mechanical Moth, Y-Luk-O and The Eternal Afflict. Two remixes for Wolfenmond, a medieval-band from Marburg, have been released on Wolfenmond's new cd Wintersturm.
