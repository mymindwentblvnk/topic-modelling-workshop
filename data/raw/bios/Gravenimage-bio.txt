The band was founded in 2007. Four pals from Kotka, Finland, wanted to play make music together and that's where all that started. Now there's six members in the group and they're playing some gigs near Kotka. Gravenimage placed second in the local band-competition and recorded also a 2-song demo in early 2009.
Once they changed their name to Drapery Falls, but soon they changed their name back to Gravenimage.
