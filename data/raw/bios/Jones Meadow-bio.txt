Swedish composer, multi-instrumentalist and producer Jonas Engdahl was bred from the Stockholm indie rock scene. After purchasing a Rage Against The Machine record at 7 years old, it was clear that this kid had a lifetime of musical passion ahead. 

Playing bass in various bands since he was 10, while picking up new instruments along the way, music had completely taken over his life by the time he was a young man. After successfully headlining China’s massive MIDI music festival, Jonas realised producing music was the seminal way to express himself and started to experiment with electronic music. As Jones Meadow, he creates dreamy experimental house music with noticeably tasteful influences of funk, soul, pop, and jazz. His talents shimer through his music, regardless of the genre he’s creating. 

Since late 2017 Jones has begun to make a name for himself on the internet with more than 60 million streams on Spotify alone. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jones+Meadow">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
