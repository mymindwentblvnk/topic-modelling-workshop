Unified Theory was a rock super-group, made up of two ex-Blind Melon members (bassist Brad Smith and guitarist Christopher Thorn), ex-Pearl Jam member (drummer Dave Krusen), and newcomer Chris Shin on vocals/guitar. Unified Theory was originally called Luma, they issued a 4-track CD through their website in 1999. But after they were signed to Universal later that year, they changed their name to Unified Theory (Einstein's unrealized life's work).

In August 2000 the band issued their self-titled debut album. While working on tracks for a second album, delays set the band back, and Krusen grew somewhat frustrated and left. That eventually lead to Unified Theory's breakup. They have since announced plans to release a new album consisting of the recorded material for the second album (some of which has never been heard) as well as songs from the Luma period. No timetable has been set for this release.

Unified Theory is also progressive metal band from Portugal. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Unified+Theory">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
