Aggressive. Vicious. Violent. Nearly perverse, these are all words that describe Lupine Fall. This immense hatred combined with actual talent makes this Lupine Fall really something to hear. This is a band that you must support, and I don't just say that because he's one of our own; I say this because the music really is incredible and it would be a shame to see this art lost in the endless seas of pathetic black metal doppelgangers. New EP coming out this year. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lupine+Fall">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
