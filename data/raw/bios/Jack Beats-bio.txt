The brainchild of Beni G (Mixologists) and Plus One (Scratch Perverts), Jack Beats represent part of the new wave of British house music. Wobbly basslines, big breakdowns and edgy accapella’s are cut, copied and pasted together to create a floor-filling brand of house.

Citing influences as diverse as Timbaland, Rage Against the Machine, A Guy Called Gerald and SebastiAn, this British duo demanded our immediate attention after their gob-smacking take on Boy 8-Bit’s anthem Fogbank dropped earlier this year. What followed were bass-heavy collaborations with Deekline and Wizard, bombastic refixes of Trip’s guitar-driven Who’s That? and The Black Ghosts classic I Want Nothing and the unforgettable transformation of Epic Last Song by Does It Offend You, Yeah? into a classic pop-dance tune.

Now the newest member of the Cheap Thrills ranks (home also to Sinden, Herve, Detboi, Machines Don’t Care) and a firm-favourite for lovers of all things glitchy and fidgety. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jack+Beats">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
