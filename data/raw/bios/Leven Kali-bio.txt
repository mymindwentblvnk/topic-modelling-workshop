Leven Kali is a singer/songwriter/producer from Santa Monica, California. Born in Holland, and raised in SoCal, his sound reflects the many different cultures and backgrounds that make up his personal identity. Funk, jazz, gospel, R&B, and Hip-Hop elements can be heard all throughout his music.

At only 20 years old, Leven has acted as the bridge between multiple generations and genres of music to create a sound that is both nostalgic and forward thinking. So far Leven has collaborated with Casey Veggies, Thundercat, Parliament Funkadelic's Ricky Rouse, Jojo, and upcoming super-talent Topaz Jones, Zack Sekoff, and Taylor Mackall.

Moving forward, Leven Kali has tons of music set to be released in the very near future. Collaborations with Chicago based rapper Mayo, Los Angeles DJ Venessa Michaels, as well as more solo projects are on the way!

Leven Kali recently stepped away from division 1 golf to focus on his career in music, but still remains a student at UC Riverside studying business and media studies. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Leven+Kali">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
