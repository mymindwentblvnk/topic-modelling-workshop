The Infected melts faces with the consistency of a burning urination from kidney stones. If you aren't having the time of your life at their show there's a good chance you died in the pit. Never a dull moment and always plenty of beer, The Infected's sophisticated musicianship blends with raw punk power to create a sound unheard anywhere else. 

Founded in the depths of hell millennias ago, The Infected has been mercilessly kicking ass and taking names since people had either one. With a home in Chicago, America they constantly plague the streets with terror and chaos. But when they aren't doing that you can catch them tearing up the local scene. 

Their current line-up consists of:
Clay Bail - Lead Guitar
Buck Foley - Bass
Matt Gonzalez - Drums
Nate Madden - Lead Guitar
