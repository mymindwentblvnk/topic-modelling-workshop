About Annexed Asylum:
Annexed Asylum is a band whose members draw upon influences from a wide range of metal's subgenres. These include, but are not necessarily limited to, Thrash, Death, Black and even what some call the New Wave Of American Metal. The band's lineup began to form in March of 2008 and was completed in June. Their debut recording entitled 'Combustion' (which is produced entirely by the band and engineered by the band's own Tim Boykin) was completed by August of 2008. However the first pressing wasn't seen until mid March of 2009. Currently the band is focused on promotion and songwriting for a future release.

"Annexed Asylum has managed to successfully blend traditional influences with contemporary elements in a way that does justice to both schools of thought, and is a band that anyone with an affinity for Thrash should pay attention to." - Harvest Moon Music
