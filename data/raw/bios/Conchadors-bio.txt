Conchadors is a heavy metal band from Turkey.

They formed in Afyon(Turkey), 2003. The group had a lot of member changes and the last form of the group is below.The composition of the group’s music was shaped with basicly heavy metal and rock'n roll, glam rock and (especially) thrash metal.

The group which performed a lot of concert, had difficulties because of lack of facilities in Afyon. Towards the end of 2004, the group went towards to compose and in the summer of 2005 the first demo was released.The bad circumstances of Afyon and nonexistence of working areas resulted in much more ambition in the group.In March 2007, they released the album called “Strange” and containing 7 songs with their own facilities and the help of their friends.

Conchadors feels heavy metal in themselves.They object to all of the injustice, caisson diseases in the world and nonsenses which are made in the name of music and they express them with their music and lyrics.They prefer to compose the most impressionable one to the hardest one which is their principle.
