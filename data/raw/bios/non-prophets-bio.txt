Non-Prophets is a pairing of lyricist Sage Francis and beatmaker Joe Beats. Their debut album, Hope was released on Lex Records in 2003. In early 2004, they toured the United States on the infamous Fuck Clear Channel tour.

The duo came to people's attention with their first effort, the "Drop Bass" b/w "Bounce" 12" single on Emerge Music in 1999. The follow up release came in 2000 as the "All Word, No Play" vinyl single.

Shortly after the Non-Prophets singles caught a buzz Sage verbally committed to the up and coming label, Anticon for the release of his first solo album. Until Personal Journals official unveiling in 2002, Francis self-released his "Sick Of" series which included Non-Prophets material.

Around the same time Beats created his first compilation of instrumentals, Reverse Discourse. Here Joey introduces his unpaused/uninterrupted style of producing. With Sage's help the album saw the light of day on his label, Strange Famous Records.

Today, the two are established as soloists. In 2004 Sage signed to punk label, Epitaph Records. In 2005 his second solo album, A Healthy Distrust was the first of three records to come out on the Los Angeles label. That same year Joey released Indie Rock Blues on independent label, Arbeid and 24-7 Records.  Rumor has it the two no longer talk and refuse to work together.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Non-Prophets">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
