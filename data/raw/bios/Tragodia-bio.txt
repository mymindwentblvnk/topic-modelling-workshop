In 1996, the industrialized, Northern Italy-situated city of Brescia was the perfect place for Tragodia to be born and for their music to start being shaped. Ten years have past since then. Ten years of truly dedicated musical research across the domain(s) of gloomy yet melodic metal.

After releasing in 1998 a critical-acclaimed demo-tape, "Dramas in splendent realms", which the band tried to achieve a fresh balance between raw doom-death roots and bitter gothic influences with, in 2001-2002 Tragodia entered the studio again in order to record their self-produced "All our miseries" mini-CD, a pompous opus of symphonic gothic metal. Both the demo-tape and the mini-CD earned the band awards from various metal magazines, with "All our miseries" being awarded as top-demo of the month by Italian Grind Zone (like the Dramas in splendent realms demo-tape) and French Metallian magazines. Many gigs (including a live appearance in Greece!) followed both releases.

2007 - Tragodia are proud to announce that the producing of their first full-lenght album, consisting of 9 gems of melodic yet powerful, catchy and intense metal, mastered at the world famous Finnvox Studios by Mika Jussila, is completed. The album, entitled "The Promethean Legacy", will be released on Oct 1, 2007 by Dark Balance Records (The Netherlands).
