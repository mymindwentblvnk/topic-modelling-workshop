PROPHANITY was a Swedish black/death metal band

Mathias "Farbaute" Järrebring & Christer "Grendel" Olsson formed PROPHANITY late -91 under a different name. It was hard to find a permanent rehearsalplace and members. It was not until -93 when the line-up was completed by Anders "Wouthan" Malmström things started to happen.

During -94 PROPHANITY released 2 demos, "Demo #1" & "Messenger of the Northern Warrior Host" which recieved a great response in the underground. An 7" EP, "I Vargens Tecken (In the Sign of the Wolf)", was also released as a collaboration between V.O.D. and Sorrowmoon in -95.

Next year was a bad year as the equipment was stolen and PROPHANITY their rehearsal-place. It was not until autumn -96 when to new guys joined the band, Robert Lindmark (bass) & Nicklas Magnusson (guitar) things went the right way again. The band rehearsed a lot and recorded the famous "The Battleroar"-demo in early -97. It led to a deal with Blackend and the debut, "Stronger Than Steel" was recorded in Los Angered Recording with Anders "Andy LaRocque" Allhage as a producer. The album was released May -98 worldwide and one year later by Metal Blade in America.

1999 was a hell of a year too as Mathias & Robert decided to leave. 2 new guys, Carl-Johan Sörman (vocals) & Christian Aho joined instead but things didn´t work out as planned so PROPHANITY decided to kick Carl-Johan. Then Nicklas left too and everything was put on ice.

In 2009 Prophanity is active again, the current line-up:

Christer "Grendel" Olsson - Vocals, guitar
Anders "Wouthan" Malmström - Drums, bass
