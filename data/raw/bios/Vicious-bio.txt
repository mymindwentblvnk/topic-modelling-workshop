Vicious may refer to:

1) The Brooklyn-born Jamaican rapper, Lil' Vicious, onetime protégé of Doug E. Fresh. In 1994, Vicious dropped the "Lil" from his name and released one album, Destination Brooklyn.

2) A "graveyard rock" metal band.

*Hailing from Gold Coast, Australia, VICIOUS formed in January '96. Initially they were influenced by all the classic bands of the punk genre (Ramones, Exploited, Misfits, Sex Pistols etc.) but through the years have broadened their sound to develop their own unique style which also incorporates elements of streetpunk/oi!, and dirty rock a la Motorhead, Dwarves, Zeke, Turbonegro etc. Now as it stands they have a good variety of songs in their set, mixing fast heavy thrashers with dirty rockers and drunken sing-a-longs.

3) A UK female grime MC from Scare Dem Crew
