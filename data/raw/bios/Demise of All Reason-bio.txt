Started at the end of May 2006, 6 guys from Southwest Florida met and put their ideas for a band together. Phil Pluskota (Guitar) has previously played in Prying Eyes. Jon Morrison (Guitar) has been shredding since he was 11 years old. Now looked upon as the father of the band at age 24, he brings his years of experience to push the music to a new level. His most recent project was as a guitarist in A Horror Story. Lawrence "Mike" Iannuzzi (Drums) has been playing drums since before he could walk. His father had a major influence on his musical life. Mike brings a strong music theory knowledge to the band. And just added to the mix of brutality is Jeff Eveleno (Vocals) previously of Mid Day Murder and Rob Plunkett (Vocals) previously of Foul Intent.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Demise+of+All+Reason">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
