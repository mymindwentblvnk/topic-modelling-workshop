Born in Hamburg is a German blues-pop singer. She describes her style as "modern soul-pop with a touch of retro".  With her debut album out many have comprised her singing style to a mix of electro modern beats, trip-hop and post-punk Bond references. She discovered her love of soul as a teenager herself, "I was in my youth, often alone, especially at boarding school. Where I worked a lot with myself and just with the music," she says. Almost every day she went to a music store and heard music by Lauryn Hill, Etta James and The Fugees.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Leslie+Clio">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
