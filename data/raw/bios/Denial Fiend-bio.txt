Denial Fiend was formed in the beginning of 2006 by Kam Lee (Massacre, Death), Terry Butler (Six feet Under, Massacre), Curtis Beeson (Nasty Savage, Lowbrow) and Sam Williams (Down By Law) and specializes in a musical style that's rooted in the tradition of classic thrash and death metal bands such as Celtic Frost, MASSACRE and VENOM, with lyrics that revolve around themes of horror and slasher B movies of the '50s, '60s, '70s and '80s.

Denial Fiend released its first album, They Rise, in 2007. In January 2009 Kam Lee and Curtis Beeson announced they left the band.
