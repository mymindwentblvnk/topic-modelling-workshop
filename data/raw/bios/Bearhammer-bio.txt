Bearhammer started as a two-piece side project in Louisville, Kentucky, with just Matt McCutcheon (drums) and Steve Curtsinger (bass).  They were in an indie rock band at the time and after band practice when everyone would leave, they would just start playing super-fast thrash metal songs for fun.  Matt was also in another band called Great Floods that shared the space with them. Great Floods's guitarist, Nick Smith, eventually heard these songs and kept pushing Steve to get back to playing metal again.
