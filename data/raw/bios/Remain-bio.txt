[1] Remain was a 90s hardcore band. Emotional music, thought provoking lyrics, mid-tempo hardcore that is full of passion and is not pretentious or forced. Musically, it sounds like Ashes, later Outspoken, even later Turning Point. Lots of octaves, melody, no real "break downs" per se. This was the time before modern "dancing" had evolved, and the mosh was very ungraceful and barbaric, and the tempo of the music went along with that. There's even a couple of awesome dive bomb's hidden in there. Lyrically, touching on subjects that were VERY big in the 90s, like indigenous people's struggles, wondering why people abuse substances, and fires burning about something or other. Vocally, kind of a rough singing and very emotional delivery, like the singer could have been literally crying on stage because a tribal land is disappearing.

This CD was recorded in 1994 at For The Record in Orange, CA. Many OC bands recorded there in the 90s and early 2000s, such as Farside, Enewetak and Adamantium to name a few. I saw Remain many times in the 90s and I was initially drawn to them because some of the members weren't white. That may sound weird, but growing up brown in white-as-fuck Newport Beach, and realizing that Hardcore was (and to an extent still is) a white/male dominated genre, I appreciated the diversity.
