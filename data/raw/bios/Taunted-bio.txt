TAUNTED is an American speed metal/thrash band from the San Francisco Bay Area formed in 1992 by vocalist Jacques Serrano and guitarist Joey Genoni with the addition of drummer Henry Moreno in 2003. In late 2009 guitarist Matt Gower and bassist Pete Aguilar solidified the line-up. 2010 marks the 18th anniversary of TAUNTED metal music that has endured and enjoyed its past and recent success.

Since the release of their 2000 DOOMED PLANET vinyl EP and their first full length CD “ZERO” in 2006 TAUNTED has garnered countless positive reviews as well as been heard across the world on FM and internet radio. In that same year Germany’s largest METAL publication HEAVY magazine asked the band to be on the METAL CRUSADE CD that had distribution over 30,000.

After seeing the response from fans in the USA and abroad, TAUNTED was determined to continue to release the most intense METAL music and execute the sound live. CD sales of “ZERO” continued to rise and TAUNTED became a BEST SELLING artist on CD BABY.

In the summer of 2008 while in the writing mode for the next CD, TAUNTED was invited to perform at the SEATTLE METAL FEST which put a final stamp of approval on the legacy of the “ZERO” CD and put in motion what was to be the beginning of the new CD “BLEEDING BLACK”. What is now heard on the new CD “BLEEDING BLACK” intensifies the sound of TAUNTED and brings to the table a defined epic style of THRASH METAL that is updated and HUGE! TAUNTED continues to be a local favorite band in the SAN FRANCISCO “THRASH METAL” scene and with a tour in the works and another radio blitz for “BLEEDING BLACK” via SKATE BOARD MARKETING waiting to be unleashed, this chapter of TAUNTED promises to be the most exciting yet. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/TAUNTED">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
