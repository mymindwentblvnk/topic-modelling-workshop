Nordic popstars are dominating the charts, and Ea Kaya adds a much needed new voice to the lot. The young Dane’s got a special gift for storytelling and you’ll find yourself humming her melodies after a single listen. Ea Kaya has a wonderfully powerful, easily recognizable voice that contains just the right mix of childlike wonder and hard-hitting realism.

“The true novelty of Ea Kaya’s style is her ability to marry her lovesick, intimate verses with an addictive and commanding chorus” (Arc Street Journal)

Growing up in Copenhagen, the songstress spent her early teens studying the composition, rhythm, and lyrics of her favorite songs and soon after she began writing her own. When finishing high school, she decided to get out of her bedroom and started mixing her pop with everything from soul/jazz to acoustic rock – even switching to her mother tongue for a while.

All of the experimentings paid off and Ea Kaya felt certain about her sound. Settling with electronic pop, the 21-year-od recorded a solid amount of demos. In September 2016 indie label No3 (CHINAH, Kill j) received these and the same year, Ea Kaya was offered a record deal. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ea+Kaya">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
