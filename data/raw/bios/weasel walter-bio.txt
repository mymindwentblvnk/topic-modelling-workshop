Weasel Walter is an experimental drummer and composer.  He is most famous as the leader of The Flying Luttenbachers, but also leads other projects such as the Weasel Walter Sextet.  He began playing in Chicago in the early 90s, and has subsequently moved to the San Francisco Bay Area in 2003, where he has lived ever since.

Weasel Walter can most frequently be seen playing drums, although he plays bass, started out on guitar, and has taken saxophone lessons from Hal Russel.

Walters has cited influences as numerous as the Free Jazz of musicians Albert Ayler, Hal Russel, and Cecil Taylor, No Wave, Black Metal and Noise.  Although many compare his style to that of Naked City in its mixing of genres and sense of irony, his is unique in that his compositions do not clearly show which genre they are, whereas Naked City's style more frequently involves switching between clearly definable genres every several seconds.

Walter has also gained fame as an expert on no wave music. He has given several public lectures on the topic, including to members of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Weasel+Walter">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
