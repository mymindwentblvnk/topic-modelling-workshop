Good old Los Angeles… Take a second and breathe L.A. As I drive through the 110-South, passing under the skyscrapers that makes L.A. the landscape it is, I pop in the Black Wall Street Journal Volume 1. Skim through the tracks and hit the song called "Cypha" and banged it out the car. While exiting the off-ramp in South Central, I catch the last sixteen of the rap and can't help but drop my jaw off the dude's lyrical content. Rocky remake? Whatever… do a punch line movie on Dubb.


Born April 21, 1987, Twenty year old Quincy White, better known as "Dubb" is certainly the young man amongst young men. Recently, he worked on The Black Wall Street Journal Volume 1 mixtape and is well known for his end all of all end all verses on the track called the Cypha featuring Game, Ya Boy, Juice, K-Dot and Jay Rock. But who is Dubb and why is his career on the move?
