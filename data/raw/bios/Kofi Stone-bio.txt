Let us introduce you to Kofi Stone, the wordsmith with an appreciation for golden age hip hop. 

Who?

East London born, Birmingham raised Kofi Stone is a rapper on the rise.

The Sound

Kofi’s laidback delivery belies some substantial lyrical content touching a range of crucial topics from family structures to the repetitive state of rap culture. Whatever he tackles, his work with producers like Jake Milliner and fellow Brummie Joe Corfield has shaped a timeless sound that merges the best of ’90s hip hop with golden cuts from mid-century jazz.

The Story

Cutting his teeth in school-yard rap battles, Kofi has now released three killer singles – Same Old, Rodney Place and Talk About Us. With DJs such as Semtex, Twin B and Tiffany Calver firmly in his corner, it is evident he’s one to watch for 2019.

A sold out headline London show in May, followed by the announcement of two headline shows in Birmingham and London in October, alongside a BBC Introducing slot at Reading and Leeds Festivals this summer, further reaffirms his status as an up-and-coming star.

With a debut project expected for the end of summer, Kofi Stone’s stock is bound to keep on rising.
