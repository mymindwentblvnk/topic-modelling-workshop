The SymphOnyx project, with ten years of existence, was found in 1995. Throughout these years, the band released two EP's: Psicofantasia (1997) and Utopia (2000), and played in countless live performances. After several adjustments, they finally reached the actual line-up, which is composed by João Guimarães (lead vocal), Carla Ricardo (female voice), Carlos Torres (drums), Martinho torres and Tiago Abreu (bass guitar).

In 2005, we met their brand new work "OPUS 1: LIMBU" Produced by Daniel Cardoso (Head Control System), this album reveals the strong character and the firm attitude towards music. The single advance "Winterfall" shows us both sides of their musical influences: rock and classical. The CD-single includes the first video clip of the band, directed by Pedro Cunha.

The aim is to lead the audience onto a journey through the land of imagination, dream and fantasy.
