Coloma is the collaboration between singer/lyricist Rob Taylor and producer/composer Alex Paulick. Their fourth album love's recurring dream was released in February 2009 on italic Recordings featuring the single standstill. Though originally from England, the two spent a period of musical education and discovery in Cologne, Germany, where Taylor is still based. Paulick flits between Berlin, the UK and his teenage hometown in California (a few miles from the Gold Rush town of Coloma). This geographical caprice is without doubt one key to the Coloma sound.

Coloma's debut silverware (2002, Ware Records) was widely praised for its rare combination of emotive songwriting and minimal electronics. A live appearance at Sonar in Barcelona introduced the group to a wider audience. The follow-up, finery (2003, Ware Records) solidified Coloma's reputation for finely crafted sophisti-pop. The album was received with enthusiasm internationally.

Coloma's third album dovetail (2005, Klein Records) found the duo taking an unexpected step away from electronic sound, in exchange for a collage of edited real-time performances, guest musicians – even a horn section. Once again, dovetail was an intriguing pop-hybrid, characterized by the Taylor/Paulick approach to songwriting. Thanks to Coloma's dedicated and surprisingly large following, enough online votes were cast to deem dovetail "Best Album" at the Qwartz Electronic Music Awards in Paris. Justus Köhncke 's remix of no moving parts spent eight weeks in the German Dance Charts, peaking at number four. 

Prior to the release of love's recurring dream, Coloma have been rehearsing a six-piece band lineup for an initial string of live dates in 2009.
