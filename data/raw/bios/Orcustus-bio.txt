Orcustus first came into being as a band from Bergen, Norway in the beginning of 2002, but the material presented on the first demo had been written by Taipan between 1998 and 2000 in his former band Abattoir, which also comprised of Slegga from Suffering Seas.

Orcustus so far released four albums. World Dirtnap EP (2003), Demo 2002 (2003), Wrathrash EP (2005) and released the first full-length self-titled album Orcustus on March 3, 2009.

The band now consists:

Taipan - Vocals, Bass, Guitar (known also from Amok)
Dirge Rep - Drums (known also from Gehenna, Gorgoroth, Enslaved, 122 Stab Wounds, Nattefrost, Craft and Aura Noir)

It also consisted of three Gorgoroth members: Infernus on bass, Tormentor on guitar and Teloch on guitar.

The band name is taken from the underground 'zine Orcustus which BÃ¥rd 'Faust' Eithun of Emperor and Thorns fame published in the early 90's.

Taipan contributed guest vocals to two tracks on Taake's Hordalands Doedskvad album; lyrics and guest vocals to Nattefrost's Terrorist album; and lyrics to one track on Thunderbolt's Apocalyptic Doom album.

Dirge Rep contributed session drums for Desspo Hallelujah on their first demo; lyrics for The Deviant's Ravenous Deathworship album; spoken voice intro for Deathcult's Cult of the Dragon album.
