Mourning glory is a Death Metal band formed in late 2009. However only getting a full line up at the end of march 2010. 
Now starting to get a good listings of gigs supporting bands such as CATTLE DECAPITATION(USA), GOROD(FRANCE), BEYOND TERROR BEYOND GRACE(AUS) we have begun to gain much experience in playing death metal and put our most into every gig whether it be to 1 person or 1000. Prepare to be seeing us in a venue near you sometime soon...
