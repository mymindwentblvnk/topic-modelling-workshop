NOISM was formed in 1999 by Yoshiro Hamazaki (guitar) and Tomoyuki Akiyama (programming) in Tokyo, Japan, to pursue the ultimate brutality and complexity of music. 

NOISM has consistently used programmed drums. The band initially had vocals and bass but eventually phased them out as they established their own musical style. NOISM released the first demo entitled Brutality and Complexity in 2000 and performed in live shows in Tokyo with other Japanese death metal bands for the next couple of years. They also released a number of songs online between 2001 and 2004. 

After Tomoyuki moved to the United States in 2002, the band continued making songs remotely between Japan and the United States. NOISM contributed two songs to the compilation album Drummachinegun from Relapse Records in 2006. 

Their new album Â± was released from Crucial Blast Records on August 26, 2008. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Noism">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
