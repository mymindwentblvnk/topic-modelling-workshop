Alexandra Stumm (voc., drums) and Andreas Wartha (guit., arr.) first met in 1997 in Trier, Germany. In the beginning they were jamming in a local rock band together. Later Andreas fell in love with electronic music and Alex traded her drums for a microphone - Solasoap was born! They are living in Berlin now since 2000 and signed the indie label "popagenten". Their songs have been published on various compilations. The album "That Feeling" was released in 2007. It's a retrospective on 10 years of creative teamwork..
