Bad Sounds are an indie-pop five-piece from Bath. Since forming they've quickly built a loyal fanbase with their music. Tracks like 'Banger' and 'Wages' (which was featured on FIFA 18) have laid the grounds for the band's own unique sound and helped establish them in the industry. They released their debut album "Get Better" in August, 2018. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bad+Sounds">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
