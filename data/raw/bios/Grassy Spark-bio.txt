Despite having been around for just over a year (began 2012), South African band Grassy Spark have played such festivals as Synergy Live (main stage), Up The Creek (river stage), Rocking The Daisies and Splashy Fen (main stage). Not bad for a band fresh out the blocks. The band fuses elements of Reggae, Ska, Rock, Latin, Old-school R&B and more creating a modern and refreshing, foot-stompin’, spine-jigglin’ sound. Grassy Spark seeks to inject new life into the once mighty SA Ska scene.

Grassy Spark recorded and released their debut offering “The Virtual Kids” on the 21st September, from their bedrooms. They wrote, recorded, mixed and captured their live sound It was then mastered by Simon Ratcliffe at Sound and Motion Studios before being released onto the World Wide Web for free, receiving over 1000 downloads in their first week.
