1) Fifth Column is an all-women experimental post punk band from Toronto, which came about during the early 1980s. They took the name Fifth Column after a military manoeuvre by Francisco Franco during the Spanish Civil War.

Their live shows often included films played overtop of the band and a 'go-go' boy dancing. They were frequently accompanied by guest musicians who played instruments as varied as saxophone, trumpet, flute, or violin.

Independent-minded, they released their recordings, including their second full length recording All-Time Queen Of The World, themselves. A video for the song "Like This " from the album was directed by Bruce LaBruce with Fifth Column. The band also appeared on a number of compilations.
