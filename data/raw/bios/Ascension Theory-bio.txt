Rising from the ashes of Aztec Jade, Ascension Theory was formed by Tim Becker and Leon Ozug in 2002. They quickly began recording their debut album Regeneration in Tim's spare bedroom at his apartment. Tim worked on programming the drums, bass, and keyboards. Leon covered the guitars and vocals. After seeing some success with their album they began to work on their next album, Answers. Chad Lenig was brought in to take care of the drums. Right now, all three are taken up with side projects (Driven Worship, Black Tooth Grin, and Primitive Groove) but have expressed interest in making a third album when they all feel the time is right. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ascension+Theory">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
