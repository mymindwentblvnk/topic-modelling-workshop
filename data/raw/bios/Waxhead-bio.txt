A bit of modern 'tude & grime' to easygoing surf culture. A little bit of thrust in hand with playful sounds. Dirty seaweed rock for dirty listeners.
Rockin' out surf grunge with love and a filthy lust for epic sound and gritty adventure.
Waxhead are a 4 piece formed late 2012 up in the Byron Bay hinterland. Finny, Moffo and Beggson all born and bred byronites while vox man, Froggy, born and spent his early yrs in Santa Cruz, California. Coming back and forth from the States to Byron until he was 8 yrs. old, then settled into the chilled, surfing lifestyle with the other boys. All meeting each other in the early yrs. of high school, but only forming a band together recently. Influenced by great mother ocean, people, Byron & 70s culture and intrigued by the sounds and style of good old fashioned rock n roll legends such as Led Zeppelin, The Doors, Nirvana, Neil Young, Clapton, Hendrix and the list could go on. All these guys want to do is surf, chill out and make music in the hills.
