Ahumado Granujo is a band formed in 1999 in Prague, Czech Republic, combining techno (typically used as song intros) and goregrind in the vein of old REGURGITATE, GUT, CUM, DAHMER with a heavy sound of down-tuned guitars, dance rhythms, and sophisticated guttural vocal lines. They also incorporate some mental electronica styles to add a unique twist to their brutality.
