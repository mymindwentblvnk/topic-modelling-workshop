Path of Destiny is a German melodic death metal band from Thuringia, which was founded in 2007.
The band was founded in February 2007 in the Saalfeld-Rudolstadt district in Thuringia. After moving to Lothra, she released the demo Dead End Road in 2008. Two years later on May 28, 2010 the debut album Rise & Fall, a self-release, which also contained three of the songs from the demo. On February 1, 2012, the EP Parasite God was also self-distributed, after which there was a change in vocals. In 2015, Apostasy Records was able to inspire a label for itself. The collaboration culminates in the release of the album Dreams in Splendid Black on April 1, 2016.
In the meantime, the location of the band moved from Lothra to Hof (Saale) and back to Thuringia due to some member changes. 
In 2017 and 2019, guitarist Christian Reinhard was also on stage as a live bassist with the Thuringian death metal band Deserted Fear. 
From a stylistic point of view, the band covers a broad spectrum of different influences from various metal subgrenes such as Black Metal and Thrash Metal, with modern Death Metal mixed with melodic parts and hooks forming the basis. The use of orchestral accompaniments is also striking.

Bands like Dimmu Borgir, Hypocrisy, Kataklysm, or Septicflesh can be named as cornerstones of the musical direction.
