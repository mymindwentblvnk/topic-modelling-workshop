Zombie Death Stench plays reanimated death metal mixed with underpinnings of old school Black metal. Mixed within and between their aural assaults are cold analog sounds that are evocative of horror movies and Sci-Fi of the late 70's and 80's. Their lyrics are laden with references to horror movies and the darker sides of occultism. Nothing is Sacred to them. . .
