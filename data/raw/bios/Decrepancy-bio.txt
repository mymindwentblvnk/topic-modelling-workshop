Decrepancy is serbian death metal band from Jagodina formed in 2004.
Members of original line-up were: Igor Nikolic Gizma (vocals), Andrija Marovic (guitar)
and Zoran Sokolovic (guitar) at that time also a member of the band Infest.
As you may noticed, they had problems finding a drummer who will be able to play their songs.
After they split ways with Petro (Sacramental Blood), with whom they did some rehearsals, they decided to find a permanent solution for the drummer. 
Then they met Djole who become their friend and consistent member of the line-up. 
Very soon after that, due to the personal problems, Zoran Sokolovic decided to leave the band. Before he made a decision to leave, they recorded a demo in home production. Instead of live drums on demo is used rhythm machine. The sound of demo was very raw so band decided not to spread copies into public.
In winter 2008. Marko Radenkovic joins the band on bass guitar, so the bend was set for
rehearsals again, and after few months of rehearsing band had one gig. Very soon after Djole leaves band, they faced another drummer problem.In summer of 2009. Dusan Milosevic-Dule(ex.Infest),joins the crew, so Decrepancy were almost complete. Again after few months of rehearsing they had another gig, after which Cvele joined the band on guitar, and finaly band is now as they imagined it.
Decrepancy have finished material for the whole album which is recording in Kragujevac in WildCat studio, if everything goes as planned it will be released in spring of 2010.
