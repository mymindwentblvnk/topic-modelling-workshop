The Lumberjack Feedback is a sludge/doom band from Lille (France) since april 2008. The first idea was to be a stoner band but the band decided to take another direction with dark and slow ambiances, without forgetting the rock n’roll. The line-up is instrumental and is composed of four guys, two guitar players, a bass player and a drummer. The first demo of the band is going to be in progress and the support may be a 7” LP to release in the end of 2008.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Lumberjack+Feedback">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
