Tom Chaplin - the soaring, emotional voice that lay at the centre of Keane; the anthemic, multi-million selling British band who scored 5 number one albums between 2004 and 2013, delivering such unforgettable hits as Everybody’s Changing, Is It Any Wonder? and Somewhere Only We Know - has returned with his extraordinary solo debut The Wave. 

Releasing on October 14th 2016, The Wave features eleven incredibly honest and ultimately uplifting songs written by Tom, produced by Matt Hales (Aqualung, Lianne La Havas) and recorded in Pasadena, California and London.

From the first evocative track Still Waiting, Tom takes us on a cinematic journey through life’s ups and downs that is both uplifting and incredibly moving. Another highlight, Hardened Heart, deals with some of the demons Tom has lived through with an endearing clarity and honesty. While the album occupies some dark spaces, it’s defining emotion is life affirming and joyous, Tom's unmistakable voice driving all eleven tracks with a range of emotions, never previously scaled.

The Wave is one of the boldest, moving, musically triumphant albums anyone has made this year. It’s a keeper. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tom+Chaplin">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
