Band got the full line-up in early 2006, all members from 16 to 18 years all, but still skilled. Band was formed by guitarist's Jere Pöyhönen and Joonas Pulkkinen. Later Sami Leskinen and Jani Rissanen joined the band as drummer and basist. They made couple of songs with that line-up, but something was missing, vocalist and keyboards to create more atmosphere to music. Jere knew a keyboard player Sami Partanen, so he desided to give a try for him. Around the same days, Sami Leskinen met a vocalist from one of his friend's band, and since Raven Claw didn't have a vocalist yet, Henry Hämäläinen aka "Portto" was asked to try singing in Raven Claw. Now Raven Claw had a full line-up. Band begun to make more songs and got 3 gigs, then was the time to record the demo "Illusions Created By Insanity". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Raven+Claw">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
