Beginning in 1983 while its members were in 8th grade, Desacrator (sic) was the band that would eventually evolve into thrash metal / progressive rock outfit Thought Industry. Consisting of Dan Roe and future Thought Industry members Brent Oberlin, Christopher Lee Simmonds and Dustin Donaldson, the band recorded a single 7-track demo entitled 111MZD  in 1988. Dan Roe left the band in 1989 and within a month the band was re-christened Thought Industry. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Desacrator">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
