November Aria was formed in 2001 - one of the first modern female-fronted bands in the New York City area.  The band released the "Morning Star" demo in 2002 and some single recordings immediately after, which were included on later issues of that demo.
In 2003, original vocalist Jennifer Meany left the band to pursue solo material.  She was replaced by Kristina Angelli, and the band released a new, untitled demo in 2003.
Jennifer Meany returned in 2004 to lay vocals down on the bands latest effort, "The Advent."
In 2005, Dianna Angelli joined the band as vocalist and released the first full-length November Aria CD, "Annunciation in Blood" - which is featured here on Last.FM including two bonus tracks from "The Advent."
In 2007, the band was dissolved due to the bands dis-satisfaction of the ever more trendy and less substantial female-fronted Metal scene. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/November+Aria">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
