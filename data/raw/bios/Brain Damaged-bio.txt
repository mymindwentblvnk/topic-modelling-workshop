Formed in January of 1994, Brain Damaged was a grunge band that totally rippped off Nirvana. The band's career has been rocky as a result of the members constantly being placed in prison because of drug charges, battery, assault of minors, threats, lewd actions in public, disruption of the peace, assaulting members of local bands, and many other actions that can not be repeated unless under the court of law. But with a fresh start in 2007 the band has just released an EP that will be followed by a LP soon later.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Brain+Damaged">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
