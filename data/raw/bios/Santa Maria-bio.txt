Santa Maria is the solo project of Maria Eriksson. Eriksson is most known as the singer, guitarist and songwriter in The Concretes and Heikki. Santa Maria's musical content is not very related to the pop music of The Concretes. Santa Maria is significantly more multi-faceted; she mixes intricate singer/songwriter-tunes with deeply progressive pieces, intelligent and distinctive dance anthems with stunningly beautiful tracks.

There is also a Russian Power / Heavy Metal Band Called Santa Maria. Formed in Moscow during 1992. And is still active.
Released two albums : Sea Serenade (2001) and Living On The Edge (2005) <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Santa+Maria">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
