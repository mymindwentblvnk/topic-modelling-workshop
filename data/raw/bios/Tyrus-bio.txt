Tyrus were an Australian Heavy Metal band from Melbourne who were active from 1984 to 1986. Tyrus were one of the first Metal bands in Australia to adopt the European style of thrash Metal. 
In their short two year period Tyrus managed to develop quite a healthy following playing to good crowds in various legendary clubs throughout Melbourne. Tyrus also played with Mortal Sin in Sydney and a show in Adelaide with The Bengal Tigers; both very successful shows.
Tyrus did not release any vinyl at the time but did record a four track demo tape which  did sell quite well and did received favorable reviews throughout various local and European Metal magazines. Due to many requests this demo tape has now been digitized by Arkham Chronicals in Spain and with an extra track an EP entitled "Rats Will Have Their Feast" will be released in April 2012.
Tyrus disbanded in late 1986 after Peter Hobbs (Vocalist/Guitar) decided to form Hobbs Angel Of Death which after a lengthy lay off are currently active again. Alex Radanov (Lead Guitar) is currently working with Skeleton Creek which is a recording only project. Chris Phillips (Drums) is currently with Vulvagun. Mick Zaitcz (Bass) current projects unknown.
