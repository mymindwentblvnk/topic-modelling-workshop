Formed in April 2001, Trauma Concept came together for one thing - their love of metal. Ever since, they've become known not only for their "enormously heavy" sound, but for their high intensity shows as well.

With members from Texas, New York, and Massachusetts, this Framingham, Ma. based metal band has fused all of their influences into an original, focused, attack. The result is the double bass assault of Derek Jay on drums, the searing vocals of frontman Jesse Preston, John Jones' guitar riffs that go from blistering, to down right brutal breakdowns, and Scott Heron delivering an evil, damaging rumble from the bass. Thus, creating their own distinct sound that Boston SoundCheck Magazine describes as "..potent, throbbing, enormously heavy music".

Since their debut release, "The End of Denial"(2002) [recorded by Adam D. of KillSwitch Engage (Roadrunner Records artists)], the band has been a non-stop powerhouse, gaining a nationwide fanbase. With performances at large festivals such as GWAR-B-Que (w/Lamb Of God), Milwaukee MetalFest (w/Exodus, Arch Enemy, Nile), & Locobazooka (w/Black Label Society, Hatebreed, Disturbed), Trauma Concept has proven their ability to win over and "own" crowds of any size. Combine these accomplishments with constant touring, and the fact that the band had only been around for a year and a half when these accomplishments were made, and you can plainly see that Trauma Concept is unarguably one of the hardest working bands out there. Surely one to keep your eyes and ears on!

With the addition of being part of MTV's "Battle For Ozzfest", the response to the band has been overwhelming, and brought worldwide requests for them to pass through new areas. One thing is for sure - This band will continue to play more shows in a broader area for an increasingly larger audience. Overall, Trauma Concept will prove to you that metal is here, it’s been improved, and there’s no stopping it.
