DISSIDIUM was formed in the early 2000’s and has since then focused their work and general Artistic View on DEATH METAL. 
There the band’s members find the solid aesthetic ground and inspiration for rescueing the content of their musical formation. 
Many different lines of artistic expression are present in the circle of themes sough by the band, especially FILM. 
So the GORE aesthetics of the so called “B” MOVIES from the 70’s and 80’s could not be out of DISSIDIUM’s scheme of subjects to be approached on their lyrics. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dissidium">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
