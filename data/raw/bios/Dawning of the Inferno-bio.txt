BIO
So the band started off by vocalist Josh Mchaffie parting ways with Argent Strand after recording the Punisher EP. Afterwards, he joined the band Devour the Suffering where he met guitarist Jin Kim. After a while they started the band DOTI as a side project. Meanwhile Carl Dick and Eric Gallier were in a band called Cicada. Carl also wanted to start a side project with the same characteristics that DOTI was going for. So after a few craigslist messages, the band was started, where we released our first demo titled "Chronoprision". Soon after this release Eric joined, and finished our EP Cognitive Dissonance. We are now looking for that other guitarist to complete our line up, but that's not stopping us from the dawning of our reign in the Vancouver music scene. The downfall has begun! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dawning+of+the+Inferno">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
