Two bands named Blood Suckers exist : 

1) A defunct grindcore / mincecore from Belgium 
2) A punk band from Oslo, Norway.

1) Formed in 1994 by Christophe Pels (lead guitar) and Gregory Pels (bass / vocals), although their line-up wasn't stable until 1995, after the departure of the first drummer Nicolas Incoul) with the 2 other members : Pierre Marchal (rythm guitar and vocals) and Michaël Thiry (drums).

Blood Suckers were a grindcore / mincecore from Attert, Belgium. But for them the real beginning of Blood Suckers' history is the recording of the demo "Bestial Murder" in 1996. Before that demo they were playing OLD SCHOOL DEATH METAL but they had just recorded some rehearsals. They started to spread their music in the underground in the beginning of 1997. But it's with their second demo " Human Factory " that they've increased their contacts and distribution in lots of countries on each continents.

They call their music SHIT CRUST (it's a Bloodsuckin' mince core with some fast Hard-core and Punk passages and pessimistic lyrics about most of humans' stupid way of living and all its bad effects on earth).

In the end of 1998, Michaël left the band because of a lack of motivation about their musical' orientation. They went on as a trio with Pierre at drums + vocals, Greg at bass + vocals and Chris at guitar + vocals. They recorded their first full length CD called "Fuck milk ... got beer ?" in the end of 1999. This CD was produced by a little 100 % DIY label called BIBA REC (ITALY).
