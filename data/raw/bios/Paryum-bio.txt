In 2012, JC Koudelka (lead guitar) and Harold Myers (drums) formed the eclectic Nashville metal outfit Paryum, soon joined by David P.T. (bass and vocals) and Blake Byrd (rhythm guitar). The group draws from all corners of the genre, marrying the pulverizing cacophony of death and grind with the infectious hooks and obsessive perfectionism of the groove and technical strands to create a new-meets-old sound that roars from the speakers like a hundred "Best of Metal" compilations synchronized into a single bone-snapping symphony of brutality. Paryum has a knack for making you want to wiggle your butt along to the rhythm just as they're cracking shards of your skull into your gray matter with punishing riffs, agonizing breakdowns, and blood-curdling screams. The band takes no liability for loose fillings, broken glasses, shattered eardrums, unhinged jaws, bruised organs, or psychotic episodes, but after you give them a listen, you'll know who's responsible. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Paryum">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
