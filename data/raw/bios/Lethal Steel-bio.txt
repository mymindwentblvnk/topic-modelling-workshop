Lethal Steel is a heavy metal band from Sweden, formed in 2011. Lyrical themes are mostly about evil, alcohol and seduction. Band have just inked a deal with High Roller Records. In 2012, the band issued their first demo and started to play some smaller venues in their home country. The only tape they had for the festival was this 4-track demo; with the first Grim Reaper album on the B-Side.” The name of Lethal Steel’s first album for High Roller Records is "Legion Of The Night". It contains eight traditional heavy metal anthems in the vein of Air Raid, Ambush and Black Trip. The album was recorded with Olof Wikstrand from Enforcer. 

Band started recordings in late 2014 but due to Enforcer’s live schedule and Jonte who broke his hand in a bathroom accident the day before the guitar recordings, they did not finish it before the end of May 2015. The album contains five completely new songs, two old tracks never recorded (‘Into The Void Of Lucifer’ and ‘Nattsvart’) plus ‘Nocturnal Seductress’.
