Of atmospheric riffs, deep melodies, fast and heavy rhythms with scream vocals consists the band from SÃ£o Paulo - Brazil. Spreading Hate is formed by Renan Brito (vocal/guitar), Jeff Hita (guitar), Eduardo Ayres (bass) and Lucas Cassero (drums) proposed to bring an innovative and different material, anyway, fucking good music.

In 2004, when everyone was just drunk children and headbangers, was decided to start a band. Jeff Hita (guitar), Bruno Mattos (drums) and Eduardo Ayres (bass) began the Death Unlimited, the only Norther cover in Brazil, so they were always looking for new musicians to fill the band. Some people came in, but didn't last a long time cause were not interested. This way was the hard search, determined and hopeful. Then, in 2006 they found Renan Brito who filled the vacancy of lead guitar, and soon he got the vocals too. So, with great pride they were Norther cover until 2007, when were started the compositions with Renan for the first EP entitled Nightfall.

The drummer Lucas Cassero comes to complete the line up replacing Bruno Mattos that for personal reasons left the band.

The recording of Nightfall began in 2008, in Jeff house. After a working hard and positive criticism, in July 2009 the EP was finished in association of great job of Chrystian Szankowski on mix.

Spreading Hate is just beggining, with mission to make great music that mark a insane soundtrack in your life, and giant vision of kicking asses all over.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Spreading+Hate">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
