Spires That in the Sunset Rise is the musical collaboration of Kathleen Baird and Taralie Peterson. Previous members include Tracy Peterson and Georgia Vallas. Through these relationships, the music has evolved over more than a decade into a synthesis of various influence, with an arduous search of the unexamined (albeit darker sides) of folk music. Steeped in primal experimentalism and world eclecticism, the music is a repellent and magnetizing swarm of harps, guitars, cello, drums, harmonium, banjo, mbira, spike fiddle, bells, and vocals. They have been a staple of the Chicago music community, and are now based in Madison, Wisconsin. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Spires+That+in+the+Sunset+Rise">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
