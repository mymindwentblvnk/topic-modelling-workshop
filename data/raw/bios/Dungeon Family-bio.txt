The Dungeon Family is a hip-hop / R&B / soul musical collective, based in Atlanta, Georgia and specializing in Southern hip-hop / Dirty South with heavy funk and soul influences. The group derives its name from "The Dungeon", the name given to record producer Rico Wade's basement studio where many of the early members of the collective did their first recordings. Wade, Ray Murray, and Sleepy Brown constitute the production/songwriting team Organized Noize, who have produced hits for Dungeon Family members such as OutKast and Goodie Mob, and also for outside artists such as TLC and En Vogue. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dungeon+Family">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
