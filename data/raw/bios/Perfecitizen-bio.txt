Perfecitizen was born from the last pieces of the band Alienation mental, in 2011, Prague, Czech Republic.
The songs feature multiple time signature and style changes throughout, switching from chaotic blasting grind, to brutal death metal. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Perfecitizen">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
