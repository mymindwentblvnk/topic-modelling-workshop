The band is essentially the same band as Hevisaurus, but due to disagreements between the band members and Sony Music on rights on the band name, characters and songs, the founders decided to abandon the original Hevisaurus name, and release new music under the SauruXet name. The line-up is the same, but Hevisaurus has not been officially disbanded, and the intentions of the record company on the band's future are not known. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/SauruXet">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
