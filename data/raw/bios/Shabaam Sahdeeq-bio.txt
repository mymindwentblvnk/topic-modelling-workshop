Shabaam Sahdeeq (Brooklyn, New York City, New York) has been one of the most respected and recognizable underground rappers to come out of New York for the past few decades. Originally Sahdeeq came up releasing a bunch of mixtapes before becoming a part of the hip hop collective Polyrhythm Addicts. The group released one album before parting ways to launch their respective solo careers. Before releasing his solo debut album, Sahdeeq was dropping features, most notably for Pharoahe Monch's mega-hit remix, Simon Says. Shabaam Sahdeeq released his debut in 2001, Never Say Never, but lack of push from the label made certain that the release was a commercial disappointment.

Not much was heard of Sahdeeq since the years after his solo debut, during which he did a stretch in prison before returning to the rap game with several mixtapes during and after 2005. Since then he has released multiple albums in indie labels, 2006's Strategize and 2014's Keepers of the Lost Art. However, Sahdeeq is best known today for his frequent features, musical presence in the internet and worldwide touring. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Shabaam+Sahdeeq">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
