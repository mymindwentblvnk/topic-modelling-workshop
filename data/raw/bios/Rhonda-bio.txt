There are several artists named Rhonda.

1) The quintet Rhonda from Hamburg, Germany, didn't form until March 2012 but a rise such as theirs has seldom been made by any other German band. All five musicians are no beginners and have played in well known indie bands, 4/5 of them formed garage rock band Trashmonkeys. When playing around with their instruments at a band practice, they recognized they all love 60's classic soul music like motown or northern soul and so they changed from garage to soul, self characterized as a fresh, retro, but by no means dusty, mix of Amy Winehouse, Duffy, Adele, Dusty Springfield, The Ronettes and Detroit Cobras with melodies you'll just love to dance to.
As a test the'd been playing two club tours in England in 2013 (were audience is known as extremely demanding in soul music). These had been a big success for Rhonda and so it came to pass that they were ennobled by His Majesty Paul Weller as a support act on his Germany tour in 2014. Shortly after those concerts they released their debut album "Raw Love" on July 25th, 2014


?) Wrong Rhonda.  The one I listen to is the "Maori Maiden" from New Zealand.  The music is very much like American country music from the late fifties & early sixties, but sung in an eastern Polynesian language called maori, heavy on the pedal steel guitar.  The album I listen to came to me from my daughter who once spent some time down under.  I also have a didjeridu and a really fierce tribal mask that I treasure as a result of that excursion long ago. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rhonda">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
