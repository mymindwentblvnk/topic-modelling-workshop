There is more than one Dreamless.

This concerns the band Dreamless, from Minneapolis, MN. 

The debut album All This Sorrow, All These Knives... was released in December of 2011 by Handmade Birds Records. 

Artist statement: "We want to convey moods of sorrow and regret through music. We adore simplicity and ferocity and try to make those a reality through Dreamless. We worship at the altar of noise and guitar abuse. Crushing shoegaze and exploding hearts...."

Influences:
Centaur, Hum, My Bloody Valentine, Slayer, Bardo Pond, Mogwai, Burzum, Codeine, The Melvins, the Jesus and Mary Chain, Sonic Youth.

Sounds Like:
Crushing tidal waves of epic sorrow and glacial noise.

Who knows anything about the other Dreamless? Apparently, they have a record called "Fable 2.0"
