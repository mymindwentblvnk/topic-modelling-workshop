Hitsuji Bungaku (羊文学) is an rock trio from Tokyo, whose name translates to something like "Sheep Literature". They started in 2011 when they were freshmen in high school. The members are Moeka Shiotsuka  (guitar, vocals), Hiroa Fukuda (drums) and Yurika (bass).

Originally a 5-piece all-girl high school band that covered songs by チャットモンチー, GO!GO!7188 and Sambomaster, they began writing their own songs and performing locally around Tokyo. In 2013, as high school seniors they were finalists in the Yokohama Highschool Music Festival. To concentrate on studying for university entrance exams the band went on hiatus but reunited as a 3-piece and began playing shows again in March 2015.

Their music shares the same soulfulness, dark lyrical content, emotional power and sonic intensity as リーガルリリー and きのこ帝国's earliest material. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hitsujibungaku">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
