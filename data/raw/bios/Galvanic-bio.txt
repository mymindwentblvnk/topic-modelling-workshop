GALVANIC is a metal band from Surrey, England. Originally named "My Sentence", the band gradually grew determined to merge their influences into one sound and combine it with their own styles to create something unique. Reluctant to be categorized as a certain type of metal, GALVANIC strives to cover new musical grounds and produce something totally original.

Additional line up change in March 2006 with Rich on guitars and Russ on drums. More changes in March 2007 with Paul joining the band and Rich moving on to pastures new in August 2007. Now with its strongest line up to date, new material being written and a new album close to being completed, its gonna be a one hell of a year for GALVANIC.

The following sums up GALVANIC and its purpose in life:

"GALVANIC fuses elements of traditional metal whilst embracing new technologies and styles. In essence we are Galvanizing metal into one pure entity."
