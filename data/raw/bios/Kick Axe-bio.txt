Full-throttle Canadian metal band Kick Axe achieved an ultimately brief but rambunctious burst of popularity in the 80s upon the release of their debut album 'Vices'. That 1984 album was produced by impresario Spencer Proffer, who had also been behind Quiet Riot's multi-million selling smash 'Metal Health'. As remarked by critic Steve Huey, Kick Axe's work "was a milestone in the history of Canadian heavy metal... offering a batch of solidly written and exuberantly performed songs".

Receiving moderate success both in Canada and the U.S., the band sounded akin to arena rock contemporaries such as Aerosmith and Van Halen. Originally named "Hobbit", the group evolved into "Kick Axe" in 1976. Hailing from Regina in Saskatchewan, Canada, it had a good run riding the 80s hard rock boom, even appearing on the 'Transformers: The Movie' soundtrack in 1986, before folding in 1988. Sporadic reunions have taken place after the new millennium. Their latest work is 'IV', which came out in 2004.

The line-up during their 80s heyday:
George Criston - lead vocals
Larry Gillstrom - lead and rhythm guitars, backing vocals
Raymond Harvey - lead and rhythm guitars, backing vocals
Victor Langen - bass guitar, backing vocals
Brian Gillstrom - drums, backing vocals
