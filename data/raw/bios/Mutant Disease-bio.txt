DEATH TO FALSE METAL!!! In a high school, far away in a land called katy, two thrashers would fight their way through hordes of gay ass posers, emos, and jocks. We turned our heads toward the sky and listened for the steel. And thus we were granted an awesome afroed shredder ahead of his time, a KICK ass drummer (who moved to Mexico like a little bitch), and...a crappy bassist?! oh well we'll deal with that later. Anyways, clad in nothing but denim and leather, Aaron and Damian are still killing scores with demon swords. We're writing new kick ass thrash tunes and trying to get the message to YOU! And so it was, the unholy alliance of Aaron and Damian thrashed and destroyed (tried to at least) everyone in their path. Unfortunately they didn't get very far, however, and eventually Damian was cast out from the halls of metal. Since then a few other would be thrashers were considered to team up with the man behind it all, Aaron, but none have stayed. As of now the metal future is unclear for the Mutant assault. There are powerful metal warlords out there i know of, but the question is will the heed my call? One thing is certain though, Aaron hones his skills everyday to make sure that YOU, GET INFECTED!  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mutant+Disease">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
