Electronica duo consisting of John Ciafone & Lem Springsteen.
As Mood II Swing, production duo Lem Springsteen and John Ciafone became one of the most in-demand remixers in the late '90s. The duo's production career began modestly, however. After a failed attempt at R&B, the two turned to house music. Early productions such as Sylvano's "Helpless" and Wall of Sound's "Critical" were a step in the right direction, as were releases such as "I Need a Bitch" for Cutting and "Searchin'" for Groove On, but it was the duo's remixes of Ultra Nates "Free" for Strictly Rhythm that struck gold. The song became a huge hit and soon Mood II Swing was remixing big-name producers like BT ("Remember") and King Britt ("The Reason") as well as the next Ultra Nat√© single, "Found a Cure," which also became a huge hit record around the world. Then, as a testament to the duo's success, the New York-based Nervous label dug up some old, forgotten productions by the duo and released them as Mood II Swing's Nervous Tracks. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mood+II+Swing">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
