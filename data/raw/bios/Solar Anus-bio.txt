There are two Solar Anus. A rock band and a noise band.

Beginning life with 1997's ON, as a dizzy and druggy, slow motion stoner doom outfit, Solar Anus channelled both the garagey spacestomp of old Monster Magnet, the epic miserablist doomscapes of Candlemass, and the purposefully obtuse sludge riffery of the Melvins, taking all of these disparate but distinctly heavy sounds and incorporating all manner of primitive percussive rituals, drifting dronescapes, 16 rpm Krautrock groove, dreamy angelic female vocals, massive fuzzed out guitars, huge in-the-red monster drums and swirls of creepy crawly dirge into a truly epic dronedriftdoomgroove sound. The band's blend of propulsive tripped out krautrock, dizzying drum jams and glacial stoner sludge is at once ominous and swoonsome, crushing and psychedelic, lurching wildly from tripped out tribal Can worship to massive bulldozing metal grooves to super abstract druggy dreamscapes.

Solar Anus  (2) is a noise improvisation band from Athens, Greece. Its sound is influenced mainly from the japanese and american noise scenes. The band started somewhere in 2016 when Manos Chrisovergis and Thorivos started experimenting together (both of them have a past in noise music). Together they have played in various venues including squats, galleries, a dada festival... They have also collaborated with other musicians during their live performances. From 2018 the band consists of Manos Chrisovergis and Thanos Tsalamas who do noise and Aggeliki Mantzavinou who sings. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Solar+Anus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
