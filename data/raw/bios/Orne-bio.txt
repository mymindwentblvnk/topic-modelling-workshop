A dark progressive rock side project of Kimi Kärki of Reverend Bizarre and Lord Vicar, featuring the entire former line-up of Reverend Bizarre.

Started out under the moniker Mesmer, but changed to Orne in 2001.

Recorded a cover of the Mandala song "Don't Wake Me Now" under the Mesmer moniker in 2000 for the album "Tuonen tytär: A Tribute to Finnish Progressive Rock."

Even though he did vocals on the albums "The Conjuration by the Fire" and "The Tree of Life," Sami Hynninen doesn't consider himself a member of the band.

Orne came third in "Best Foreign Record" category, and won the "Best Artwork" in Prog Awards 2007.

Although they take their name from the works of H.P. Lovecraft, a Finnish family with the same name threatened legal action against the band in 2006. The band briefly considered changing their name to The Orne, but eventually kept the name as it was.
