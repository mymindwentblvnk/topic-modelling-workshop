    A tale,...

    After many drunken jam sessions and getting a bit over hiring local halls and PA's ..and freshly armed with a brand new BEER CAN DEMO, we marched down the F3 Freeway to gigs in Sydney with local metal/punk illuminaries, like MORTAL SIN, ADDICTIVE, WHITE TRASH, CROMOK, ARMOURED ANGEL, DETRIMENT, MASSIVE APPENDAGE, MASSAPPEAL and THE HARD ONS.

    ...lots of All-Age gigs and over 18 shows got us around the country a few times... including gigs at the ferocious Treasury Hotel in Brisbane. Lots of trips to Canberra, The Gong and Newcastle. Melbourne never really liked us, except the nice TARAMIS fella's who always gave us shows, and probably beer as well.The drive to Adelaide was never, ever good - "I hate this bus", we never got to Perth.

    Believing wholeheartedly we were going to change the world of metal ;o) we released our first EP "DYING PHASE' (1991) self funded.It was put together on a budget smaller than we spent on beer. It sold OK - it was on CASSETTE and VINYL only, (schweeet!) and was never repressed. We played our first festival - The (one off defunct) STEEL SPRING FESTIVAL with schmucks like ROXUS - at least WHITE TRASH were there to save the day, despite attempts by some to put petrol in a diesel bus.

    Played with MOTORHEAD in 1991, on the 1916 TOUR
    1992 we played with SEPULTURA at the Hordern Pavillion on the ARISE TOUR, we also played METALFEST, another one off festival (we seemed to be good at playing them) with ALLEIGANCE, TUMBLEWEED, MORTALITY, and a host of OZ metal bands. 1993 saw us get stiffed and play with METALLICA on the , ..well....., we played 2 nights in the foyer of the Ent Centre in Sydney through a vocal PA. Kind of a weird scenario and its odd how many people remember seeing it.
    We also did these shows with PRESTO (ex-SLAUGHTER LORD), another great Sydney band.

    These we also the heady days of great ROCK CLUBS like the COBRA CLUB (FAITH NO MORE played the REAL THING TOUR there) and there simply are clubs run in that format any more. They had these THURSDAY METAL NIGHTS that alternated between the THRASH Night and the GLAM night. It was a great vibe ROB HALFORD (JUDA'S PRIEST) was out with his new band FIGHT...BAD BRAINS were there one night as well.

    LEWISHAM HOTEL, SEVEN HILLS HOTEL, lots of long gone venues...SPRINGFIELDS!!!1994 we finally released our debut Album BONSAI and did our last full National tour. Well after about 6 years...what started with laughter, ended in tears and soon after our drummer was replaced with JASON from local Central Coast pub greats DAMAGED GOODS. That same year,1995 we recorded and released our last EP, BEAUTIFUL DAY and did some of our last interstate shows. Towards the end of 1996, or maybe 1997, with almost a full album of new and probably by far our best songs we put the ole' dog down.
