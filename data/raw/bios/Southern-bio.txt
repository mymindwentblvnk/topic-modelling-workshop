Southern are a brother and sister duo from Belfast, Northern Ireland, formed in 2011. Southern play a mixture of blues, alternative rock, pop and folk/bluegrass. Signed to Marathon Artists, they released their self-title debut EP Southern in 2013 to glowing reviews. The band has been championed by BBC Radio Ulster's Gerry Anderson who has described them as "the most promising singer/songwriters in Ireland today."
Southern's single Where the Wild Are was premiered on BBC Radio 1 on Phil & Alice's show. 

Having spent the year touring with the likes of Bastille and Jack Bugg, Thom and Lucy bring a fresh boldness to their new single, Cool Kid.
This track and its B-side, ‘Sympathise With You’, are sure to build on the buzz that we’ve come to associate with the Belfast duo.
