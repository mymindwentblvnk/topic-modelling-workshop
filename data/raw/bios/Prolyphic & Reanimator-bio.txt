Prolyphic and Reanimator is the first Hip-Hop act that signed to Strange Famous Records. Their debut album, “The Ugly Truth,” is finally done being recorded and mixed after THREE YEARS of madness (3 crashed hard drives, vocals recorded, re-record, mixing, re-mixing.)

Rapper PROLYPHIC (Providence) and producer REANIMATOR (Chicago) will make their definitive mark on hip-hop with their first single “Artist Goes Pop” dropping in March ‘08. 
Despite Prolyphic’s reputation for having high lyrical content and Reanimator’s beloved production on all of Sage Francis’s albums (Personal Journals, A Healthy Distust, Human the Death Dance,) P&R remain relative unknowns in the indie rap world. SFR decided to put he two together for “The Ugly Truth” album, and it’s sort of like when chocolate first met peanutbutter.

“Artist Goes Pop” is an explosion of the bottled up frustration felt by Prolyphic in regard to mainstream mentality in music, while Reanimator backs him with one of the most head noddingest beats since DJ Premier’s prime. “Survived Another Winter” features SageFrancis, B. Dolan and Alias, who all share some New England camaraderie while taking turns to criticize “those who go West Coast in search of fame.” The one non-album track, “Salt,” picks apart consumer culture and the dead-end job lifestyle it creates. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Prolyphic+&+Reanimator">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
