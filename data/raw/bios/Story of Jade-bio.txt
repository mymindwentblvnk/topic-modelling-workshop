FEAR... is a strange sensation... it is something that shakes your nerves from the inside out makin' you yell and scream out… it’s a rush to the soul .

As everyone grows and changes through the course of life, fear mutates spawning its demons... In childhood, it’s irrational fear, like fear of the dark In adolescence, it’s -emotional discomfort, social anxiety In adulthood, it’s the fear of illness/disaese In old-age ,it’s the fear of death. These are just a few forms of that fear can be, or generate in humans.

For sure, fear is a constant companion, like a psychopathic neighbour it stares at you from the other side of the fence.

But if you socialize with fear, play with it, exploit' its energy, you'll join an evil bash of the damned, crawlin' creatures and fuckin' sinners...
