Jack Name is John Webster Johns, a songwriter that Tim Presley recently described as a 'stubborn genius'. Currently a touring guitarist for Presley's band White Fence, Johns spends much of his time releasing music under various monikers (Fictional Boys and Muzz) and working behind-the-scenes as a studio wizard /collaborator for the likes of Ariel Pink and Cass McCombs. His music is a whirring psych-pop jam that couples his laid-back, cloaked vocals with rambunctious guitars, it nicely balances the low-key and lo-fi with straight-up wild, technicolor energy.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jack+Name">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
