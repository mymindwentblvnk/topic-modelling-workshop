TEEEL (Jim Smith) is a electronic music producer/songwriter from New Jersey, founder of Synth Records (Synthemesc Recordings) and iheartsynths.com. Inspired by the 80s new wave movement, Teeel credits his sound to marathon movie watching and being an obsessive gear head. Creating music in a 10×10 teal painted room, stacked with synthesizers and guitars, TEEEL produces music that ranges from hypnotic vocal synthpop to dreamwave and dark electronic rock.

TEEEL’s critically-acclaimed debut album, “Amulet” (Moodgadget Records, 2011) has generated quite the buzz in the blog world as well as being featured on KEXP radio, ISO50.com, Boomkat, and more. With a slew of remixes and singles his sophomore album “University Heights” was later self-released in 2012 and received stellar praise. The track "Marx on my Heart" was recently used in a Carmelo Anthony spot for the Jordan brand. His continued success has lead to playing more live shows and recently working with guitarist Stephen Chladnicek to elevate his live performances.

Although Teeel is a fairly new project, Jim Smith is no rookie to the music industry. Running his own record label, performing in multiple bands and professionally DJing hundreds of parties since the mid 90s, he’s been very busy. Taking the stage as TEEEL with an arsenal of synthesizers, controllers, guitars and effects, his captivating and powerful performances have grabbed interest across the world. Playing his second year at SXSW and recent appearances across the US, TEEEL continues to capture the crowd’s imagination and push forward into the future.
