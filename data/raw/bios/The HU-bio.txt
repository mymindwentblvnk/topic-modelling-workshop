The HU ("human" in Mongol) is a Mongolian folk metal band formed in 2016. They use traditional Mongolian instrumentation, including the Morin khuur, Tovshuur and Mongolian throat singing, and call their style of music "hunnu rock". The name is inspired by the Hunnu, an ancient Mongol empire, known as Xiongnu in western culture. Some of the band's lyrics include old Mongolian war cries and poetry.
