Todesbonden, founded in 2003 in Maryland, USA mixes classical, world, rock and metal influences into an ethereal, passionate individual style. A style Laurie Ann Haus coined as Ancient World Metal since no other categories exist that describe their style.

The bands lineup currently consists of Laurie Ann Haus (Autumn Tears, World of Warcraft, Starcraft 2]), Jason Aaron Wood, Patrick Geddes, Jason Ian-Vaughn Eckert and Troy Wilfong (live guitar). 

In 2004 Todesbonden released their first EP Stormbringer  written mostly by Laurie Ann Haus and programmed by Jason Aaron Wood at home with violins contributed by Patrick Geddes.

Later in 2004, Todesbonden recruited Jason Ian-Vaugh Eckert on Bass and James Lamb for keys and together the entire band wrote "Sleep Now, Quiet Forest"  

In 2008 "Sleep Now, Quiet Forest" was produced, mixed and mastered by renowned producer Jens Bogren (Opeth, Katatonia) and released through Prophecy Productions world-wide.

In 2009 they recruited Alex Hicks for live drums and parted ways with James Lamb.

Todesbonden faced delays to many of the members working on individual music projects that took most of their time.  However, Todesbonden is currently writing music for their last album and hope to have a release by 2014.
