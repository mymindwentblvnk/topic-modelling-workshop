Jethzabel was founded 1999 in Cuenca (Ecuador). Their first musical influences come from Death and Thrash Metal and they hit the stage with well known South American bands like Massacre, Neurosis Inc and Transmetal.
Over the years they placed higher requirements in the complexity of their music, the skill to play their instruments and they included some atypical instruments: Jhoffre Mora on the piano and Patricio Mora as the orchestra’s first violine. From this moment the band acquired a higher level and changed their style to progressive metal, under influences from Dream Theater, Pink Floyd, Rush , Symphony X and several classical composers.
They never forgot their initial influences and Jethzabel has now a particular musical potency, exquisite compositions and the ability to play a forceful and melodic sound.
From the year 2003 the band was nationally recognized with their first promotional song “Anathema”, they was praised in several awards as the best progressive metal band by the critics in 2005 and 2006.
Jethzabel shared stage with the Spanish heavy-metal band “Tierra Santa” on their South American Tour “When They Touch The Sky” and played in Quito for 6000 people.
In 2006 and 2007 they produced their first professional album “Vision” with 10 songs on it. They mixed progressive metal with classical arrangements and with this work Jethzabel wants to claim on a global scale.
