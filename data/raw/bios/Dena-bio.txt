Dena is the music project of Bulgarian-born, Berlin-based songwriter and vocalist, Denitza Todorova.

Born and raised in Bulgaria, she moved to Berlin in 2005, where she focused on writing music, singing and programming beats. She stepped into focus as a guest vocalist on the two The Whitest Boy Alive albums and has spent time honing her self-composed beats and finding her signature sound: a unique brand of pop, 90's inspired hip-hop and native Balkan beats. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dena">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
