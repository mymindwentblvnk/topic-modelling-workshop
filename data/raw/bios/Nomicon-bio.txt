Nomicon is a band from Helsinki, Finland. They played death/thrash Metal (early) and black metal (later).
Although trading under the pseudonyms Ceasar, Trooper, Azhemin and Agathon, Nomicon in fact comprises a quartet of Finnish Metal elite. Vocalist / bass player Ceasar (a.k.a. Tommi Launonen), having association with COARSE, GANDALF, GLOOMY GRIM, SOULGRIND, TENEBRAE and WALHALLA, is the primary motivator behind the project, which is generally regarded as a solo undertaking.
Launonen would be supported by guitarist Trooper, in fact Roope Latvala, of CHILDREN OF BODOM, DEMENTIA, LATVALA BROS, STONE, SINERGY, WALHALLA, WALTARI and WARMEN, rhythm guitar player Azhemin (Miika Niemelï), from RAVEN, SHAPE OF DESPAIR, SOULGRIND, THY SERPENT, WANDERER and WINTERMOON. Additional female vocals would be supplied by Whisper Lilith (Tanya Kemppainen) of SOULGRIND, LULLACRY and GLOOMY GRIM.
NOMICON's first presence was felt in 1990 with the inclusion of the track 'Contrast' on the Hard Blast Records, four way split 7" EP 'More Than Death vol.1' in alliance with SHUD, RADIATION SICKNESS and Dutch band NOCTURN. A three song demo, entitled 'Tri-Angle', surfaced in February 1991 with another single, 'De Rerum Natura', that same year. 
In 1995 Belgian label Shiver Records partnered NOMICON with SARNATH for a split album entitled 'The Me'. Originally these tracks had been recorded for a UK label, Tombstone Records, but then shelved until a new deal had been located. Shiver then issued the full-length 'Yellow' album in 1997. This album, recorded at WALTARI's rehearsal rooms with equipment on loan from STRATOVARIUS, saw Janne Parviainen from WALTARI on session studio drums. Limited live work saw NOMICON taking the stage as a trio comprising Whisper, Ceasar and Trooper plus programmed drums.
A demo the following year, produced by Jussi Heikkinen, preceded the 2001 'Halla' album issued through Sagitarius Productions. By this juncture NOMICON had enlisted drummer Agathon (Ykä) being a veteran of AIRDASH, BARATHRUM, CORPORAL PUNISHMENT, GLOOMY GRIM, SOULGRIND, THY SERPENT and WALHALLA. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nomicon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
