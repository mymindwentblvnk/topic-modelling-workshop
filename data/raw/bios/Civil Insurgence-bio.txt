Civil Insurgence is a technical death metal flavored thrash metal trio from Palm Desert, California. The band was founded by guitarist Greg Gunterson, vocalist Xander Raymond, bassist Addican Hatch, and drummer Isaiah Strebe in October 2008. Since its conception, Raymond has relocated to Fresno, California to perform vocal and fronting duties for the black/thrash act Atomic Violence, resulting in Gunterson taking over as frontman. So far, Civil Insurgence has released one rehearsal demo and the self-produced EP 'Hostile Action' with Gunterson on vocals.
