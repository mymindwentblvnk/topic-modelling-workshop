Formed in 1989, Siegrid Ingrid are a death/thrash metal/grindcore band from São Paulo and were named after two sisters from the neighbourhood the bandmembers lived in. Their first release was a demo-tape called "Prophecy" in 1991 and the next year an EP named "The Choice" through Rotheness Records. The line-up at the time was composed of Punk (vocals), Peu (guitars), Gargamel (bass) and Barone (drums). A videoclip for "Endless Life" was shot and it was aired on MTV back in the day. In 1995 they released their first album on CD, "Pissed Off" (Sidney Becker and André Gubber replaced Peu a guitarists, Thomas was the new bassist and Edu the drummer) and four years later their last record, "The Corpse Falls", came out via Cogumelo Records (Borô replaced Sidney Becker, Luiz Berengue was the new bassist and Evandro Jr. the drummer). The band is currently on hiatus. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Siegrid+Ingrid">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
