Kierra "Kiki" Sheard (born Kierra Valencia Sheard) is a Grammy Award-nominated American gospel recording artist. She is the daughter of gospel singer Karen Clark Sheard (member of the seminal gospel singing group The Clark Sisters) and the granddaughter of legendary gospel choral director Mattie Moss Clark.


Born and raised in Detroit, Michigan, Sheard spent her formative years surrounded by the strong influences of her family, their faith, and their music.[1] At age 6, she began singing in the choir at Greater Emmanuel Institutional Church of God in Christ, pastored by her father Superintendent J. Drew Sheard. Even at a young age, Sheard had a preternatural grip on the signature "Clark sound" pioneered by her mother and aunts, executing high and fast melismas, riffs, runs, and deep, throaty growls sometimes referred to as "squalls" (the latter is prominently displayed on "Done Did It", a traditional gospel leaning track from her album I Owe You) <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kierra+Sheard">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
