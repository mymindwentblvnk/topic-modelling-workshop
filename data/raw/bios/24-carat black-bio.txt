24-Carat Black were a soul group from Cincinnati, OH. Initially they were called The Ditalians, but after befriending arranger Dale Warren from Detroit, they rechristened themselves 24-Carat Black. 

With Warren functioning as composer and producer they released only one album, 1973â€™s, Ghetto: Misfortune's Wealth (Enterprise/Stax), a concept album dealing with the hardship of life in the inner city. 

The members of 24-Carat Black would later turn up in the group Shotgun.
