RAGLAIA was formed as a project band in January 2015 by ex-ALDIOUS female singer RAMI and producer/guitar player K-A-Z who currently plays for the SADS and KAIKI-GESSHOKU. RAMI’s former band ALDIOUS is known to be the pioneers of the girl metal trend in Japan, and RAMI was the founding singer, also responsible for writing most of the lyrics, as well as songwriting for hit songs such as “Across”, “Eversince” and “Yasoukyoku”.

In 2014, K-A-Z came across RAMI’s demos, which then became the framework of the new band project. K-A-Z recruited drummer YOUTH-K!!! from BAT CAVE who has played for bands such as KUROYUME, THE KANMURI, AION, COLDRAIN, DETROX, and female bass player ERY from KiLLKiLLS who plays a vast style of music with artists such as MIWA, PISTOL VALVE, and MARSAS SOUND MACHINE, creating the 4 piece line up of the new project.

In April 2015, RAGLAIA released their first single “Breaking Dawn” from Across Music, a newly established label specializing in female vocal music as a subdivision of Village Again Association. The new single ranked into number 20 on the Oricon weekly singles chart (Apr. 20, 2015) and number 13 on the daily singles chart (Apr. 7, 2015). The band has been working on production for their upcoming second single, and they are scheduled to begin their “Breaking Dawn 2015 Tour” in Japan starting with their show at the Club Quattro in Shibuya, Tokyo this coming June.

The band name comes from the Greek mythology goddess of splendor and glory, “Aglaia” with singer RAMI’s initial “R” added to the top.
