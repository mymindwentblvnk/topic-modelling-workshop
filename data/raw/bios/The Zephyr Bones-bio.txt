The Zephyr Bones’ hazy, melodic, psychedelic rock flickers with memories that span the distance between their native Chile and their current home of Barcelona. “Secret Place” synthesizes their guitar oriented dream pop into their own unique brand of beach wave.

The Zephyr Bones’ hazy, melodic, psychedelic rock flickers with memories that span the distance that separates the native Chile of guitarists and vocalists Brian Silva and Jossip Tkalcic, and the band’s current base in Barcelona, Spain – which is also home to rhythm section, Marc López and Carlos Ramos. The songs on their debut album, Secret Place, share something very intimate and invite the listener to travel to their own secret places, filled with dreams and promises, hidden away from the hectic world and these troubling times. Secret Place synthesizes The Zephyr Bones’ guitar oriented dream pop
—which they have christened “beach wave”— recorded in their own Eclectic Echo Lab studio in Barcelona, and mastered by Victor Garcia.

The Zephyr Bones emerged in 2015 with their debut EP, Wishes/Fishes, on Spanish label La Castanya, earning them a showcase at Barcelona’s famed Primavera Sound. The video for “Weird Summer” was debuted via Noisey who called it, “hazy pop vibes like a hit of serotonin.” The band returned in 2016 with the Black Lips/Surrounded By Sunflowers 7” single, co-released worldwide between the New York label Other Music Recording Co. and La Castanya. DIY magazine featured The Zephyr Bones in a story on the Spanish underground rock scene, alongside Hinds and MOURN. In the past year the band have become a go-to support act for artists coming through Spain including Future Islands and Boogarins.
