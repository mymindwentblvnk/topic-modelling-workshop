The Noctambulant is a Melodic Black Metal ensemble from Jacksonville, FL; with melodies that still manage to
bare reverence to the hard-edged tradition of the genre's European roots.
The Noctambulant is the creation of two veterans of the Florida music scene: E. Helvete (Vocals/Guitar),
and D. Franseth (Drums). While playing in other bands, these two friends discovered a mutual lure to forge their 
own path in the Black Metal genre; and The Noctambulant was born. 
Later, Chris Bhoff (Lead) and Lars G (Bass), were also united; to bring together the solid foundation which allows 
for the full blend and unique sound of The Noctambulant.
The Noctambulant means "Night Walker", a fitting title for a musical collective steeped heavily in the 
darker sides of metal. In the winter of 2013, the band released the 'Dreams of Rotten Silence' EP on Itunes (and other 
on-line outlets); followed by 'The Fear Leader' EP in 2014.
