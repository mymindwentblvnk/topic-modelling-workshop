2. UNSCARRED is a powerful pounding-groove machine, Wild and crazy “Thrash metal” band formed in 2002 in France, Paris. The story began when Brice/Bassist, started to think of forming his own Thrash metal band. The lineup knew many bustles but stabilized itself at the beginning of 2011 with Boris/ Lead Guitar, Niko/Rhythm Guitar. Nelly, Iranian metal singer, joins the band in 2012 as vocal and Franck joined the band recently in January 2013 as drummer.

The band already had some great experiences of scene in France. Now with this new crazy lineup and an insane new “stage addiction”, all members are in, to show the power and the magic this kind of music represent to them on any stages all around the world!!

Their first Ep, mix of anger, power, energy, aggression, weight, harmony and emotion, gonna be out, at the end of January 2013. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Unscarred">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
