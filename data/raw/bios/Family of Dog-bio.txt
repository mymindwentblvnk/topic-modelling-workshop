Family of Dog IS a great metalband from Deinze (Eastern Flanders, Belgium). Their gigs Are always very energetic, especially with the charisma of frontman Tom Claus (now Cloon). They reunited, are playing shows again and are writing new material. Their sound has grown in the meantime, they sound more mature and the new songs are a bit more technical but at least as energetic.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Family+of+Dog">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
