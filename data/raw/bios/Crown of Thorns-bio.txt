(1) Crown of Thorns was a Thrash/Death Metal band from Trollhättan, Sweden. They released two demos (Forever Heaven Gone [1993], Forget the Light [1994]) and two albums (The Burning [1995], Eternal Death [1997]) under this name. They later were forced to change their name to The Crown.

(3)Crown Of Thorns was one of the forerunners of the "disco/synth" influenced techno sound, albeit with a "punky" edge, that would become all the rage a decade later. They made their first album appearance on the Illegal Records collection The Defiant Pose in 1983 with "Gone Are The Days." Their debut EP followed in the US later that year. 

In 1984, five more songs appeared in the UK only, in various 12" and 7" combinations: "Kingdom Come", "Guns In The Name Of God", "World Radio", "Diamond Jim" and "No Man's Land".
