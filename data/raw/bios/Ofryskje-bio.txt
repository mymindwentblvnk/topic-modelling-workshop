An obscure Norwegian Black Metal band active around 1996/97 led by TAAKE's mastermind Ulvhedin Høst (Ørjan Stedjeberg), playing drums, bass and guitar. Other members were Heimvik (vocals and lyrics), Nordaas (guitar) and Sgitmar (guitar). They released only one untitled demo in 1997.
The first riff of "Skodden Jagar Tett & Graa" from this band's only release was used as the first riff on TAAKE's third album, "Hordalands Doedskvad". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ofryskje">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
