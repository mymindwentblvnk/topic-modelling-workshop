According to Brooklyn Vegan http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2009/08/an_alec_ounswor.html):  'The Flashy Python record includes contributions from members of the Walkmen (Matt Barrick the drummer), Dr. Dog (Toby Leaman and Scott McMicken), and Man Man (Billy Dufala). Alec's wife also plays some trumpet. He plays just about everything.'

RE: the record... Alec talking to Pitchfork - http://pitchfork.com/news/36005-clap-your-hands-say-yeahs-alec-ounsworth-talks-upcoming-projects/:

"That's precisely the confusion with this [ANTI solo] record. I actually have another project right now called Flashy Python that's more about me trying to erect some grand statement [laughs]. Not to say the Alec Ounsworth record or Clap Your Hands aren't personal statements. But the Alec Ounsworth record was me going down to New Orleans for a short period of time and trying to piece something together based on a collection of mostly old songs. I figured this would be a good opportunity to purge myself of those songs in a very precise and particular setting." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Flashy+Python">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
