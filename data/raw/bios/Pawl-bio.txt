PAWL is a singer/songwriter and arranger whose primary instruments are keyboards and percussion. His compositions dabble in a variety of styles: independent pop, rock, folk, solo piano/instrumental, jazz, dance, and even hip-hop. He also performs live with a backing band playing mostly songs from his PAWL albums. PAWL has also performed live with the blue ribbon glee club (acapella punk), northpilot (independent rock), RIFIFI (folk), Nicquoel (folk), Chris Blount (hip-hop), Doug Bale (alternative rock) and the giveaway (pop/rock). He has recently collaborated with the producer Keeynote. According to his website he is working on a new EP entitled "Archetypes" which features electronic percussion heavily layered with keyboards.

Some have described the Guest House EP as "cinematic pop" -- songs that tell stories and are, at once, catchy, fun, and at times, serious- but never whiny. Arrangement inspired as much by indie pop/rock as Burt Bacharach, Guest House doesn't sound like the newest trend in independent or popular music; it delivers its own unique combination of classic and modern sounds. PAWL's songwriting draws inspiration from all over the map: from the late Johnny Cash, Elliott Smith, and Nick Drake -- to modern artists such as the Sea and Cake, Beck, Spoon, and Broken Social Scene.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pawl">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
