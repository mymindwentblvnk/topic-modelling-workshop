The story goes back to the year 2000, when five young guys from Suolahti (including two present members Ari and Jesse) founded a death metal band called Lost. Through certain different stages, the band was adopting a more melodic style. When Heidi joined the band to take care of the vocals in 2004 the concept was clear among the band members. At the same time the need to change the name of the band emerged and Beautiful Betrayal was born. 

Once the musical style had formed, Beautiful Betrayal recorded their first demo at Klaukkala’s D-Studio in December 2004. A follow-up came a year later, when “Follow the Waves”- demo was recorded. This time the band choose to record at Studio Watercastle in Jyväskylä. The demo received positive feedback all over and raised interest towards the band. A vast number of live performances took place around Finland and the band was rehearsing more than ever. Beautiful Betrayal had become a group whose music is made with the interests of each member in mind, and common enthusiasm is to create music. 

The band has just finished their third demo called “Released by Dawn”. The recordings were done in the familiar surroundings of Studio Watercastle in December 2006. Let’s see what happens this time, the expectations are high...
