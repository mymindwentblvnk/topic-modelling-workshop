Stephen Vitiello is a visual and sound artist. Originally a punk guitarist he is influenced by video artist Nam June Paik who he worked with after meeting in 1991. He has collaborated with Pauline Oliveros, Scanner, and Frances-Marie Uitti as well as visual artists Julie Mehretu, Tony Oursler and Joan Jonas.

Vitiello was a resident artist at the World Trade Center in 1999 where he recorded sounds from the 91st floor using home-built contact microphones, as well as photocells and used that material in his Bright and Dusty Things album (New Albion Records) as well as in an installation environment, World Trade Center Recordings: Winds After Hurricane Floyd. The project received some publicity after the September 11, 2001 attacks on the complex.[citation needed] Vitiello has had solo exhibitions of sound installations, photographs and drawings at museums and galleries including The Project, NY, Museum 52, Los Angeles and Galerie Almine Rech, Paris. Group exhibitions include the "2002 Whitney Biennial," the "2006 Sydney Biennial" and "Ce qui arrive (Unknown Quantity)" curated by Paul Virlio at the Cartier Foundation, Paris. CD releases include "Box Music" with Machinefabriek (12k), "Listening to Donald Judd" (Sub Rosa) and "Buffalo Bass Delay" (Hallwalls). Originally from New York, Vitiello is now based in Richmond, VA where he is an Associate Professor in the department of Kinetic Imaging at Virginia Commonwealth University.
