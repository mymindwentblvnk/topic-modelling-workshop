Amarna Sky
Is a Brazilian project created by the drummer, vocalist and songwriter Deni G. Pierroni (aka Deni Deathnoise), ex-Deimos (heavy/power metal) and ex-Deep Sorrow (traditional doom metal). The musician invited by Deni to play in the project was Aldo D'Isep, guitarist, bassist and producer. The Amarna Sky proposal is to play heavy and intense music, no fear to experiment new elements and no need to be restricted to labels. You can listen in their music a lot of doom and industrial influences, as well touches of traditional and progressive metal, further the mystical spirit from the Middle Eastern, with intricate orchestrations, resulting in a kind of Monumental and Exotic Doom Metal. The Ancient Egypt is the main theme of the band, since the project´s name was inspired by an ancient city currently known as Tell-El-Amarna, ancient Akhetaten (Horizon of the Aten), built on a virgin site of the east bank of the Nile, in Upper Egypt, 44 miles north of modern Asyut in al-Minya muhafazah or approximately 170 miles to the south of modern Cairo. The debut Amarna Sky album, "Rising Heresy", with cover artwork by Mattias Norén for ProgArt Media, is being released through Anubis Music and contains two very special guests: they are Erol Unala (ex-Celtic Frost and Apollyon Sun founder) and Karl Sanders (Nile´s mastermind).
