Black Grave started several years ago under the name of Goat Molestation. A demo was recorded and passed around with the intention of recruiting other members, but it was quite shit, so nobody suitable was found. The name was changed to Black Grave and the "anvil of hate" tape was recorded and released in a limited run of 88 copies. the self titled tape is now available, limited to 100 copies, from sinister stench productions.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Black+Grave">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
