Formed in late 2011, Ian and Leonard had been playing together for a couple of years prior to Severin joining. A few months of practice went by and finally a name was chosen. Soon after the writing process for the tentatively self titled album began. The material written for that album became very different from the current sound of the band, so it was released for free as a demo.
