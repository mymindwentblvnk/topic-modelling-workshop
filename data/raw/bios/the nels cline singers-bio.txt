The Nels Cline Singers are a free jazz trio from Los Angeles led by Nels Cline, following his work in The Nels Cline Trio. They're founded in 2001, and have released three albums on Cryptogramophone. Hilariously, there are no singers in the group.  The music is incredible and complex - more of a journey than a typical listening experience.  Nels Cline is a fantastic artist when he actually plays.  The music is frequently an Avant-garde experience and is full of extreme twists and turns that in one song you will have experienced an incredible variety of moods, harmony's and just plane fun sounds.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Nels+Cline+Singers">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
