Made up of Danio (vocals & guitar), Pietro (drums & samples) and Tommaso (bass), Husky Loops first met at school in Bologna, Italy. Fast forward fifteen years to a relocation to London to study at music college and the Royal College of Art, they joined forces to form their ultimate creation, which started just over two years ago. Since putting their debut track ‘Dead’ online at the start of 2016 they immediately gained interest and attention for their unorthodox take on modern rock music, which was followed by their last single 'Fighting Myself' late in 2016 and the release of their debut EP 'Husky Loops' earlier this year via Alcopop Records. 

With hugely successful tour supports with The Kills, Sunflower Bean, Yak & Estrons, Husky Loops have gained a lot of attention for their ferocious live show and now are set to support Placebo in October as well as performing various headline shows in the next few months.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Husky+Loops">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
