There are several performers using the name “Esoterica”:

1) The UK alternative rock band, known for a while as "ESO": See http://www.last.fm/music/Eso

Emerging from the suburbs of provincial Warlingham UK, but founded in Africa, esOterica have already enjoyed much success - recently supported Marilyn Manson on two European tours, playing the KERRANG! Tour and supporting HIM at a sold-out Hammersmith Apollo, being play-listed on commercial radio shows (BBC Radio 1, XFM Rockshow, Bruce Dickinson on 6Music, Total Rock etc) and fanatical support from the hoards of fans they have picked up in the last two years of relentless groundwork.

"Every song on their John Fryer-produced album is superb, coiling majestically upwards before spitting venom." "Sweet Stuff" Rock Sound 

"The new Tool discovered in Surrey, surely not?!.. The guitar melody sweeps you in from the first bar..." Metal Hammer 

Recorded by acclaimed producer John Fryer (NIN, HIM, Depeche Mode etc), "The Fool" is a startling statement of intent from a band so young. Melding soundscape atmospherics with incisive melodies and powerhouse guitar work, it is a dark and brooding record. Esoterica's debut video for "Life Is Lonely" was shot in Los Angeles under the direction of Wendell Scot Greene and edited by Nathan "Karma" Cox (Marilyn Manson, Korn, Soil, Linkin Park) & their video for "Don't Rely On Anyone", which was shot by Carolan Productions (Keane), aired on Kerrang and Scuzz Television.
