Fragile Existence is a metal band hailing out of Toronto, Canada.
 Often referred to as death metal for simplicity's sake, the band defies being pigeon-holed into any specific subgenre. With vocals ranging from guttural roars to ethereal shrieks, complex cascading guitar solos are anchored by hammering, vicious drumming. Fragile Existence is the new breed of extreme music. Predatory in spirit and sound, fueled by raw aggression and unwavering determination. 

Formed in 2007 by Dan Glover (ex-Nephelium, Elegy of Suffering), the lineup was rounded out with Eric Machacek on guitar and Max Klebanoff (Abyss) on drums. The band recorded and self-released their debut album Departing the Damned in 2012 featuring artwork by Jon Zig (Suffocation, Disgorge, Vile) breathing visual life to the album concepts.

 In 2013 Klebanoff left the group to be replaced by veteran Danish drummer Morten Siersbaek (Spectral Mortuary, Exmortem), and sometime session-bassist Matt Hems rejoined the band full time.  After many successful live shows the band began laying the groundwork for a new album, which was soon titled "Cataclysms And Beginnings". Featuring 10 brand new songs, the album is a testament to the chemistry of the lineup and the maturity of the band. 
Now the year 2015 bears witness the release of the album as well as the re-emergence of Fragile Existence as a force to be reckoned with in the Canadian Death Metal scene.
