BLOODY SIGN was formed in Alsace, France in 1996 with a vision of playing pure unabashed darkened death metal.

The band has decided to split up after 15 years of devotion to death metal. Bass/vocalist Hagend left the band in early December 2010, which leaded Ilmar & Kalevi both founders of the band to dissolve, rather than looking for a replacement.
