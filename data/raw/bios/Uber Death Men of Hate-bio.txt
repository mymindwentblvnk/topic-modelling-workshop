Uber Death Men of Hate was the brutal brain child of Gabe for many years before finally being started in the death like heat of the 2008 Oregon summer. Soon after he recruited Kalvin on lead guitar and drum programming. They are currently looking for a real drummer and bassist. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Uber+Death+Men+of+Hate">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
