Axis of Light is a raw black metal band from Manchester, England. Their lyrical themes deal with everything from Nature to Northern England to misanthropy.

Worthy of note, is that — per their own words — all Axis of Light's Bandcamp purchases are donated to English animal rights and environmentalism causes.
