Tunneling its way out of the West Philadelphia nether worlds Make A Rising is a band that is beyond unique. The quintet’s debut record is a swirling mix of violin, keyboard, guitars, drums, saxophone, trumpet, bells, whistles, and assorted noisemakers – all swelling together for subversively addictive pop gems. With orchestral crescendos combined with off-kilter vocals and fast-changing tempos Make A Rising is the sound of chaos, bliss, bravado, nerves and naivety – avant- chamber rock at its most dynamic – like Daniel Johnston singing Beach Boys songs interpreted by Naked City. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Make+a+Rising">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
