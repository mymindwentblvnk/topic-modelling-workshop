Moritz von Oswald Trio is Moritz von Oswald alongside Sasu Ripatti (Vladislav Delay, Luomo) and Max Loderbauer (NSI, Sun Electric). They began playing live together in 2007.

"At the heart of their epic excursions here is a dream crossing of classic Berlin techno, On-The-Corner Miles Davis, Larry Heard and Can, as at home with calypso as it is Stravinsky."

Drummer on the album Sounding Lines and band member since 2015 is the Nigerian musician Tony Allen. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Moritz+von+Oswald+Trio">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
