Downfire has established themselves as a powerful Rock/Metal act since early 2004 opening for such acts as Testament, Metal Church, Overkill, Kings X, Soilworks, W.A.S.P, Misfits, VH1 Rock of Love Tour and Extreme.
The first album "Redemption" was met with rave reviews, and sold well both domestically and internationally. The follow up album "Damnation" releasing in December of 2009 is already being well received by the fans who have been given a chance to hear the majority of the album live for the last few months. The album is powerful and shows growth in not only style but the power of such tracks as "Scream" and "Last Days" while the title track "Damnation" is being built as an anthem! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Downfire">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
