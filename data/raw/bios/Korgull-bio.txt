Korgull is mexican death metal from the Yucatan area. The band emerged from the ashes of Forgotten Son due to the efforts of Daniel Coria (drums) and Hector Torres (vocals) and recruits ex-members from heavy metallers My Last Identity and stoner rockers ElDorado in the figures of Rodrigo Nuñez (guitar), Alejandro Santos (guitar) and Agustín Espinosa (bass). 

Musically speaking the band practices solid old-school influenced death metal with equal doses of brutality and slow parts. Among their influences are Morbid Angel, Grave, Slayer, Entombed, Celtic Frost, Voivod and Dismember. 

Korgull is also the name of the earliest incarnation of Swedish death metal band Excruciate. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/korgull">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
