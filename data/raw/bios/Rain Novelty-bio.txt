Two Demo CDs:
As April Comes (2000)
Back To Heaven (2002)
One promo CD: The One To Judge (2003)
Both demos and the promo were racorded at studio "LIVE".
They were reviewed by national and international magazines, fanzines and webzines (Metal & H.M. Hammer, The bloodcult zine, Forever underground zine, Eternal fields, Metal Defiance zine, skylight webzine and many more) having recieved very flattering comments (thank you all!!!).
Songs have been used for theatrical act (Zoi Valasi's Strange night, performed by the actors team << Ti Tha Pei>>) and a medium length movie (NHMA movie, directed by Spyros Hondrogiannis) and have been added to CD compilations (Synthpop avenue, Bloodcult, Mirrorball and many more). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rain+Novelty">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
