Harriet Brown is an artist, producer, composer and performer, creating his own genre of homegrown R&B. With his second album, Mall of Fortune, HB has evolved his bedroom funk to the next level, unapologetically taking us on a semi-smooth ride to sexy church, not without a rough dose of future twang. A vocalist and multi-instrumentalist, Harriet Brown’s productions are a slew of his meticulous drum programming and heavy, synthesized bass intertwined with his deeply intentional lyrics. HB not only makes us move, but also be moved; his music is genre bending, contemplative, and soulful – contemporary funk for the nostalgics. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Harriet+Brown">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
