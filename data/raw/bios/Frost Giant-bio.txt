Frost Giant is a one man project that originated in Boyertown, Pennsylvania, USA in late 2005.  Matt Frost is the main composer, songwriter, and lyricist.  Jonathan Smith of Ominous Glory has also been a contributor on lead guitar, and Jason Esbensen is currently the band's recording engineer.

Matt Frost was born in Connecticut in 1972, and relocated to Pennsylvania in 1999.  He has played drums in various types of bands since 1989, mostly in the metal, punk, hardcore, and grunge genres.  He began playing guitar and bass in the mid 1990's, and took up singing and growling/screaming about ten years later.  

Frost Giant is influenced externally by Scandinavian metal of the folk and melodic death varieties as well as American doom and black metal, and internally by Matt Frost's own scattered musical background.
