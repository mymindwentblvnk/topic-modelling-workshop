Ortank is a Polish grind/death metal band.

-------------------------------
The band was founded in early 1998 on guitatist's Tomasz Radke initiative. He starts to create firsts songs, and at the same time searches other band members. In december 1998 line up stabilized and in february the band record the tape called "Promo '99". The tape hadn't got ane kind of promotion mostly because of bad sound, and the tape was rather a recording of fascinations and music abilities of the band members. In the middle of  '99 ORTANK mada a professional record titled "Failures Theory ï¿½ Defective Members Carnival" wich contains 5 songs in brutal blasting death/gore style. This stuff take very good response from magazines and record labels from whole world, but didin't bring record deal to the band. In the meantime founder Tomasz quit the band. In november 2001 ORTANK recorded 10 for first cd called "mental diaspora association" witch is more compex, faster and brutal than first demo.

ORTANK since the beginning played a lot of concerts with such bands like: Devilyn, Corruption, Nathaniel, Disloyal, Pandemia, Yattering, Decapitated, Supreme Lord, Mess Age, Gorerotted, Patologicum, Rectal Sludge, Epitome, Whorehouse, Stillborn, Eclypse, Lost Soul
