Novack is an indiepop-band from Utrecht, the Netherlands and an alias of the german producer Pascal Fuhlbrügge.

Since the falling apart of their previous band Vladimir, Wubbo Siegers and Sander van der Linden haven’t stopped making music. Accompanied by Chris Siegers on bass and Jan Dekker on trumpet, Novack finished their debut album "Sequences & Stills" in 2010. The result is a subtle, layered piece of work, with references to and somewhere inbetween Elbow, The Notwist and Death Cab For Cutie. Novack grew out to a six-man band and recently signed with V2 Records. The record was released on January 31, 2011.
