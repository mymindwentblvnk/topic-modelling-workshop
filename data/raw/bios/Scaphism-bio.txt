Scaphism - Ear Raping Death Thrash

****Scaphism from Boston, MA is in no way affiliated with the "Plague Doctor" EP by some dudes in CT who didn't bother to find out if the name was already being used actively****

Scaphism is a death/thrash metal band from Boston, formed in April of 2007 as a side-project by Evan Woolley (Treachery, Legion of the Dying, etc.). After releasing a 2 song demo as a one-man band entitled "Butchered and Devoured" in 2008, it was decided to look for band members and continue as a full band. This led to the discovery of Alex Fewell (Forced Asphyxiation), Tom Gretschel (Never Say Never), and Tony Jordan (Sacreligion). In mid-2009, Scaphism began playing shows all over the New England area, and in late 2009 the unofficial live demo entitled "Live at Church" was released. We are currently booking and playing shows and have just released a three way split with our friends Boarcorpse and Composted which is available for FREE from any of our upcoming shows, or contact us for shipping details at myspace.com/scaphismofficial
