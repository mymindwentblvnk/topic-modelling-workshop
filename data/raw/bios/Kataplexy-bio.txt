Infusing their love for hockey, Bacciâ€™s Pizza, and all things metal, Kataplexy has been a major force in the Chicago extreme metal scene since 2007. The band has played countless shows alongside the greats (Origin, Dying Fetus) in underground metal and has plenty of stage and studio experience.

Playing a style that delicately, yet expertly mixes brutal death metal with a touch of groove to it, the band has evolved greatly since its inception, even forming its own unique style, that of Extreme Hockey Metal! Now with a new line-up, with Joel Sandoval(Bass), Matt Getto(Drums), Jason Herrera(Guitar), Mike Mayborne(Guitar), and James Boodt(Vocals), there seems to be no limit to the amount of ferocity and great musicianship Kataplexy, excuse me, KATASEXY, is bringing to the world of metal. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kataplexy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
