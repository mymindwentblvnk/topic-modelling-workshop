Thoughts From A Padded Room is nothing less than brutal Detroit Metal in it's rawest form. Forming in 2005 as three brothers they began a down a road that would change them forever. "We just want to create and play quality music for the masses!" says the front man Joe Ratke. The band is made up of three brothers, Chaz, Joe, and Ian Ratke. After winning a Battle of the Bands at the Ritz in Warren 8/29/08 put on by Howie, Chaos Theory's manager and president of Deluxxe Entertainment, they then opened up for Detroit's own Chaos Theory at their CD Release party, from there they have played with other big local bands like Woden, Teratoma, Frontline Mentality, Skull Chizel, Battlecross, Zero To Ruin, and many others as well as a few National Acts like The Analyst and Salt The Wound. Constantly looking for a way to play in front of metal fans throughout the state leaving a path of newly found fans and satisfied groupies. If you like the music on this page... you wont believe how they sound live. "We are driven by a love to perform and wreak havoc, musically of course. We hate bands that spend countless dollars on an album and cant put out a great show, we want to be different. This winter will be spent writing new songs and building a new album for spring/summer. if you would like a copy of their latest CD contact them through their myspace site. CD's are a mere $5.00. Chump change for a full 10 song CD of this caliber.
