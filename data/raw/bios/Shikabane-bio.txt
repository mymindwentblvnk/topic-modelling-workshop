Blackened crust/metallic hardcore from the depths of Tokyo, Japan, Â±ç or better known in romaji as Shikabane (Corpse).

Shikabane has put out several releases, including a split EP with Grindcore gods Agathocles (the Just/Unjust release), numerous full-lengths with MCR Company, and several EPs in the late 90's to early 2000's.

It's unknown as to if Shikabane still functions as a band, but their mark has been left. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Shikabane">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
