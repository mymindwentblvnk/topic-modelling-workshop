Tracy De Sá is a self taught rapper, originally from Goa, India, she was brought up in Portugal and Spain before arriving to France where she is now established. Tracy's music is vivid and colorful, it retraces a route of many thousands of miles across the globe and even though it derives from a culture born in the Bronx during the 70’s, the outcome is luminous like the beaches of Goa, electric like the big cities that never sleep and pure like the soul of a nomad. Tracy De Sá loves word play and metaphors that can be visualized making important subjects sound so subtle. She talks about change, life and doubts, reciting the story of a small girl who left India and flourished throughout her journey, amidst the chaotic roads of new cities. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tracy+De+S%C3%A1">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
