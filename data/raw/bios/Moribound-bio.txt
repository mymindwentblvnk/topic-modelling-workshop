The track "Where The Sun Will Never Rise Again" does NOT belong to the American Moribound, or one of the two Swedish Moribund's! It was made by the Belgian Moribund (see track wiki).

Moribound is an American black/death/thrash band who did a couple of releases in 2002 and 2003, before splitting up again. They are the only band of whom it is known they use the monicker "Moribound": the 2 Swedish bands mentioned on this page are both named "Moribund", as can clearly be seen in their respective band logos. 

A Swedish death metal band formed in 1990 in the small town of SÃ¶derhamn. Released two demos, Armageddon (1990) and Into the depths of illusion (1991).

Not to be confused with Moribound from Gothenburg. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Moribound">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
