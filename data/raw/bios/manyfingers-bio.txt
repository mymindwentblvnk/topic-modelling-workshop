Bristol-based multi-instrumentalist Chris Cole is a collaborator with Matt Elliott/Third Eye Foundation and a drummer for various bands. His music layers delicate melodies on acoustic instruments on top of each other, with subtle electronic effects.

In his live act, he uses a loop pedal to build up his multi-layered pieces part by part, as he moves from instrument to instrument, including cello, piano, drum kit, accordion and  acoustic guitar amongst others. Some of his music involves odd time signatures and multiple layers of the same instrument. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Manyfingers">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
