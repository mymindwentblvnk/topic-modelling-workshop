Kelela Mizanekristos (born June 6, 1983) is a Los Angeles-based vocalist and songwriter. Born and raised outside Washington DC, Kelela never received formal vocal training in her youth. Instead, she experimented with a range of vocal styles and writing before finding her sound in the street music emerging out of LA’s underground, most notably the producers of the Fade To Mind crew. Kelela brings forward-thinking and experimental songwriting into a prismatic context that fuses popular and club music. 

Kelela's mixtape CUT 4 ME was released on October 1st, 2013 on producer Kingdom's Fade to Mind label. Of her mixtape, she says to Rookie Mag, "I will work with all of these producers for all of my life. This mixtape is the first time I was ever able to say exactly what I meant to say. It’s a statement." 

Her first extended play, ''Hallucinogen'', was released on the 9th of October 2015 on Warp / Cherry Coffee Music and was met with critical acclaim, with Pitchfork stating ''her emotions are revolutionary'' in its glowing review of the EP.

On July 14, 2017, Kelela announced her debut studio album, Take Me Apart. It was made available for pre-order on August 1 alongside the release of the lead single, "LMK". Three more singles preceded the album, "Frontline", "Waitin" and "Blue Light", before it was released on October 6, 2017. The album received widespread acclaim from music critics and featured on various year-end lists. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kelela">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
