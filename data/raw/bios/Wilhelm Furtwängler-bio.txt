Wilhelm Furtwängler (1886–1954) was a German conductor and composer. He is most famous for his performances of Beethoven, Brahms, Bruckner, and Wagner. He was also a champion of modern music, and was known to give performances of thoroughly modern works.
Furtwängler had a unique conducting technique. Video recordings show him making awkward, gawky movements like a medium in a trance.
