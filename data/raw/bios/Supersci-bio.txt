Sweden's Supersci (formerly Superscientifiku) have experimented with rhyme patterns and dug through wax crates since the early ninetees.

Supersci as a group has existed since 1996 or so, with producer/emcee Arka and emcee Mr Noun as the constant nucleus. A few years ago, jazz cat Erik L joined in on the production tip, adding a more musical live feel. DJ Observe spins the wax. Arka, Erik L and Obscure form the production team Flyphonic, that has produced artists such as Peter Umah, Org 12, Peshi, Fattaru and Sankofa.

On the christmas holidays of 1997/98, a few songs were recorded in Arka's bedroom. They eventually ended up on the home-recorded CD Soundvalley EP, which, despite its uneven soundscape, recieved attention throughout the swedish hip hop underground scene for its laid back jazzy style. This was probably the first time anyone outside the group's home town, Sundsvall, ever heard of them.

One thing led to another, and by thorough live representation in festivals, clubs and jams all over Sweden, radio and magazine interviews and releases of sought-after vinyl releases such as the Syntax + Semantics EP from 1999, Supersci marked their territory on the Swedish hip hop map with their original style.

Other releases include Aahyeahwhatchasay (2001), How we gonna fail now? EP (2002) and All Year 12" (2005). On the latter two, the production is somewhat more mature.

The official debut album Pinetrees on the Pavement is ready for release April 24th 2006, along with the single "On the Grind" featuring Chords and "Get!" featuring Remedeeh. A video for "Get!" will also be released. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Supersci">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
