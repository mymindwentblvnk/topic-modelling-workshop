Cameron "Big Chocolate" Argon (born August 21, 1990 in Laguna Hills, CA) is an American vocalist, DJ, producer, and multi-instrumentalist. Known for his guttural vocals, he has had brief stints in death metal bands like Abominable Putridity and Burning the Masses, but since 2011 his main focus has been his own projects Disfiguring the Goddess, and Big Chocolate. As Big Chocolate, he produces electronic (mainly dubstep) music and has remixed songs for other metal bands including As I Lay Dying and Whitechapel. He also formed a side-project called Commissioner with Mitch Lucker after Suicide Silence asked him to remix "Disengage" and "No Time to Bleed" for their two limited 7" singles. Big Chocolate has toured with the likes of Dance Gavin Dance, Breathe Carolina, and Zeds Dead, as well as performing on the entirety of the Vans Warped Tour in 2011 and 2013. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Big+Chocolate">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
