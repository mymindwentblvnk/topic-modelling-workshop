Lovijatar was born in the shores of lake Saimaa in east of Finland. She is a witch of plagues and sickness and the last in line of devil Piru. She was first mentioned in a collection of finnish folklore book Suomen Kansan Vanhat Runot 1846. The name of Lovijatar was sang by the old people living in the forests of Carelia. Musical form of Lovijatar lives now in Helsinki. Lyrical inspiration comes from finnish folklore, old believes and nature. Lovijatar experiments different approaches to music without boundaries or limitations. Lovijatar brings echoes of words from people who lived long ago to the ears of modern people. Lovijatar is a combination heavy rolling riffs, hard handed playing, shamanism and the joy of endless sorrow.

Old believes were preserved longest in the east and north Finland. In early 2000th century people in the east were still worshipping Tapio the forest god and cutting marks to trees for protection. Now the knowledge is almost vanished. Lovijatar searches old folk poetry and spells, takes them to this day in a form of music and creates new paths to enter. Let Lovijatar take you to a journey to another space and time.

In 2010 Jussi Rautio (Battlelore), Tommi Vaittinen and Mikko Nevonen (Elephant Bell) felt the urge to start to do music together in finnish based on folkpoetry collected by various people who traveled Finland in 1700`s and take it forward. They wanted to combine it with stoner metal with easy going passages and high climaxis. Soon Petrus Rapo from Boner joined the band to give some extra buzz for guitars and was followed by Riku Hakala who took control of bass frequenses. Now Lovijatar spreads the word with energetic live shows and vibrant music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lovijatar">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
