SECROPIAGOR, The Melodic Atmospheric Doom Black Metal Band from Ankara...   Secropiagor was founded by Çağrı and Yiğit in February 2001. The band, formerly called Gorgon, later changed its name to Secropiagor. After that, Arif joined the band as the vocalist and Yalçın as the bass guitarist. It was a black metal band with a trash basis. In March 2001, the band recorded a two-song demo which was not offcially distributed. Later, Arif and Yalçın had to leave the band for some reasons. Çağrı and yiğit started seeking new faces. In Summer 2003, Kerem as the male vocalist, Sinan as the bass guitarist and Cem at the keyboards became the members of the band. They got rid of the old trash based black metal identity and started to give examples of melodic doom black metal. The band who believed a female vocalist would suit their new musical style and provide them with a better background, included Duygu as the female vocalist. With the advence of the female vocal, the band reached a stronger and a more melancholic sound leading them to change their name as “Secropiagor.” The band continued to work hard and published a demo in March 2004. ıt was made up oh an intro and an outro with five songs. It was 17.30 minutes long and is sold only in Ankara.  The band gave their first concert in METU May Fest on 15 May 2004. the following day, the band joined the Chaos Fest at Saklıkent. Later, Secropiagor had to take a brake due to some problems. During this period, Cem and Sinan left the band. Remaining members were in search once again and after a little while, Fırat at the keyboards and Sertan at the second guitar joined the band forming its current structure. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Secropiagor">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
