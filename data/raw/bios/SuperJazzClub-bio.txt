Ghanaian Collective SuperJazzClub are a group of nine multi-talented individuals with skills ranging from vocals and production to DJ’ing, film-making and much more. Of the nine, 6 are also individual artists and rather than navigate the creative scene alone, they decided to come together back in early 2018. But it was 2019 where they debuted their first song together: Couple Black Kids — an anthemic and confident debut which captures the essence of what it means to be Young and Black. 

2020 has seen SuperJazzClub  collaborate with artists outside the collective on their ethereal: Bordeaux — a song which doesn’t follow conventional composition structure, but this doesn’t detract from the dreamy essence of the song.

Fast-forward to September 2020 when the team released their first project in the form of EP: For All The Good Times. Punctuated by voice note interludes, the EP tells the story (millennials and young adults know too well) of not really knowing where life is going but at the end, coming to a realisation that life is there to be lived and not worried about. If you’re too busy worrying, you’re missing out on life happening all around you.

Outside of their music, their Instagram is a window into what it feels like to create something special with your friends; with an aesthetically-pleasing curation style. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/SuperJazzClub">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
