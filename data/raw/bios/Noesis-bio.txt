Noesis: pure knowledge; understanding. From the Greek nous (emotion): that which is responsible for one's thoughts and feelings. NoEsIS was officially formed with its complete lineup in March 2005 As defined by its name, the band has always been an immortal force in terms of expressing their thoughts and feelings through their technical deliverance of melodic death metal, inspiring the souls that crave for that uniqueness, which always remains an important highlight of their creations. While remaining occupied as scientist/engineers, they chose to explore technical music using their backgrounds. This approach helped them to develop original ideas in their music and elevate them further. The variety in their individual creations, their cultural differences, the wide range of influences, lessons from the pioneers of metal and their passion for music, has helped them walk quite a way in such a diminutive duration. ............ .. .......... .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..
