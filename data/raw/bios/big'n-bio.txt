Clawing its way out of Prison City, USA, and into the ranks of Chicago's early 90's noise rock scene, Big'N helped to define a sound and attitude that still resonates today. Defiantly working class, far too menacing for their own good and usually half-pissed on malt liquor, the boys of Big'N--Will Akins, Todd Johnson, Mike Chartrand and Brian Wnukowski--shared the stage with the likes of Mule, Tar and Dazzling Killmen, put out a handful of brutal releases on labels like Skin Graft and Gasoline Boost and disbanded before most music fans had a chance to take notice. Put on their LP, Discipline Through Sound, today and the music still sounds lean and mean...no small achievement for a band from a true shithole like Joliet, Illinois.
