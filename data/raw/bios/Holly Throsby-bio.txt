Holly Throsby is a singer-songwriter originally from Sydney, Australia but currently based in London. Holly's songs are mostly set at night, and are built around finger-picked guitar and her distinctive, fragile voice. 

The arrangements, which incorporate double bass, piano accordion, melodian, clarinet and the barest of vocal recordings, are both delicate and painterly.

She has released five full length albums- On Night in 2004, Under The Town in 2006, A Loud Call in 2008, a children's album, See! and Team both in 2011.  She was nominated for an ARIA award in 2006 for Best Female. In 2007 she released an EP called One Of You For Me. 

Holly has played shows with Joanna Newsom, Smog, David Pajo, Devendra Banhart and Architecture in Helsinki and has toured in Australia with Bonnie ‘Prince’ Billy, Mark Kozelek (Red House Painters, Sun Kil Moon), The Eels, Hayden, Micah P. Hinson, Art of Fighting and New Buffalo.
