Eyelash are an unsigned rock band from the United Kingdom that has been around since February 2005. The band has 4 members:
Fe - Vocals
Ru - Guitar
Marina - Bass
Flow - Drums

There was originally another member who was the bass player, Sophie, but she left the band in early 2008 due to other commitments and was replaced with Marina.

Their claims to fame are that Fe, the lead singer, appeared on a TV show on Ch4 called Musicool. This was during 2007, and she did fantastically well. They also performed at Download Festival in 2007, and were the first unsigned band to do so, apparently.

Eyelash have recently recorded a new video, Bow For The People, and it is quite frankly, stunning. New material was also placed on their Myspace profile (www.myspace.com/eyelashband) on 19th March 2008. They continue to grow and impress and have received many positive comments on their performance, for example: "The recorded material stands up on its own...Their stage presence is volcanic. 8/10" from ROCK SOUND. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Eyelash">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
