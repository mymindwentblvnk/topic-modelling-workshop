Nachtreich (2003 - 2010) was a German band and played Neoclassical Folk/Ambient with Black Metal influences. They now continue under the name Himmelsrandt. The band created 4 demo's which were only handed out to friends. Earlier samples on their MySpace showed some Black Metal influences but these were absent on their first public release, Von Dornen und Selbstmord. Their second public release Sturmgang is according to the band 'the first official demo' and has a length of 55 minutes.
