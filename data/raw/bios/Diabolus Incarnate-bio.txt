Born in 2010, a project was brewing in the home studio of Dieter (Guitarist/Vocals/Composer) in Johannesburg, South Africa. Select compositions kept aside, now an arsenal of endless material. In time these compositions became songs and released amongst the masses. Within time, the project began to attract attention by many. In September 2012 it was decided to be put to the test live by recruiting Sven (Drummer), Nicholas (Guitarist/Vocals) and Arnold (Bassist). Diabolus Incarnate is genred as a black metal band while at the same time adding orchestral elements to the music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/diabolus+incarnate">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
