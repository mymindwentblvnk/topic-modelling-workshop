The Disco Boys are a German DJ duo, based in Hamburg. Their type of music is called "disco house" but sometimes it goes as "french house". The Disco Boys consist of Raphael Krickow and Gordon Hollenga. Their incomparable mixture of disco classics and old samples with today's modern house, gave them a large fan base in the early century, far beyond the borders of Hamburg. They are performing frequently as DJs on clubs all over the world, but mostly in Germany.
