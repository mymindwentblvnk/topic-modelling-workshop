Slow Kill System from Kiel/Germany exists since January 2007.
Many influences and ideas came together in the first 3-track-demo, which is still not published yet. The Mastering was finished in December 2008. The line up has proven to be good with the instruments bass/ guitar/drums and is working creative and motivated. In October 2008 the perfect singer for SKS was found: Hendrik. Due to his style manymore possibilities arose to use the bands potential. Because of the different backgrounds of the musicians there are some contacts to bands, agencies and bookers. Right now the band is writing more songs and the first gigs for 2009 are on the run. More recordings as well as a videoproject are planed and being working on. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Slow+Kill+System">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
