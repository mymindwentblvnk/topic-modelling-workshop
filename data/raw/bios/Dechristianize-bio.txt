There are two artists with this name:

[1]Dechristianize is a Chilean Black Metal band.
They have lyrics both in english and spanish.

[2] Dechristianize is a Brutal death metal band with anti-christian, anti-muslim and apocalyptic ideas. 


The band formed in early october 2007 by the leader Andrew 'the intruder' taking another approach to his intrests and anger in this side-project from Melodic Storm. The band has released 1 EP called "The rising of".

The band was influenced by Vital remains for their lyrics and beliefs. Also, naming the band after one of their songs. The band has extremely long songs like Vital Remains to. With this the extreme guitars and drums are still there. And is more-or-less a clone band of Vital Remains.

But this is only a side project and the band is yet to figure the true direction of the band.
