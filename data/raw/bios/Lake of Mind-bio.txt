Lake of Mind is a Hungarian progressive metal band

Since the band was formed they have had many changes in members. They have been working with this formation on designing the concept of the present sound of theirs. Due to the differences in musical taste and interest they managed to develop a colorful stream of the musical fields which they would still connect to progressive metal with its elements and complexity. The drummer and bass guitarist are responsible for handling the determinant rhythmic elements, while the keyboardist, lead-, and rhythm-guitarists are taking care of the complex melodies of the songs. Balancing these two fields and working together with no conflicts help something come into existence - Lake Of Mind.
They finished recording their first album in September 2010 titled ‘A Condemned Soul’ and now are looking and waiting for someone to publish it or help them giving shows so as to let people know how they can play the songs of the record live!
