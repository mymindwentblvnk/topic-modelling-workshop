A Horse Called War was formed in November 2005 by five mates from a small, grimy English town in the heart of East Anglia know as Thetford. With so much shit music being shoved in the face of rock 'n' roll and the state of "Great Britain" turning for the worse, they felt it was time to give music a good fuckin' kick in the head, have their say and most importantly have a good time. AHCW went to Purple Studios on the 12th of June 2006 to record their first demo, entitled 'We ain't proud of this'.
The demo recieved positive reviews from stonerrock.com, Ninehertz webzine and RockMidgets.com amongst others, and was also distributed by Calculon Records through their webstore.

The band signed with Calculon records in 2007, and their debut EP, 'Stumble at Every Hurdle' was realased towards the end of the same year. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/A+Horse+Called+War">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
