Hatross is formed in spring 1990,several months after the split of DEVASTATION (www.myspace.com/devastation) by the brothers Alex (bass,vocals) and Chriss (drums),with a new guitarist Mirko,former member of a local band Condition Critical.This time,the line-up remained a three-piece,the band wrote few new songs which later will never find their official release.After just one gig,with Thrash- brothers Warhead(later Cenotaph) and local HC band Anti-Otpad,the band temporary splits because of the obligatory army service of Alex and Chriss(by the way,that damned army service in the ex-Yugoslavia was 90% times the reasons of band split- ups),so the thing remained on a stand-by until next year.In the meantime,Mirko started to play with Anti-Otpad,and the brothers remained alone again.In May,when Alex returned,he found few new people;Vedran (guitar),Damir(R.I.P.)(guitar) and Florijan (bass)-the last two guys from the then defunct Condition Critical. Chriss returned in October,the day before the war started to rage all over the ex- Yugoslavia(and it was pure luck,because the army claimed him insane and left him at the last moment!!),and the band was completed again.In December 1991,the band shoots an amateur videoclip for the Devastation track "Bigmouths sucks",which was shown on the Croatian national television,in the Metalmania tv Metal-show.That was also the only thing that Damir did with the band,he left the band before the clip was shown,and was replaced very soon by Davor.In May 1992 the band plays a show in Pula with Carcass and Cenotaph,it was the first visit to Croatia of an international band,even the war was raging about 100-150km near.After that gig,Hatross starts to play very intensively,a lot of gigs.Chriss had to left the band for a short time for personal reasons,so Alex took his place for the live shows.In August 1992 the band entered the EAR-studio in Stinjan(near Pula) to record their first (third in the complete existing of band,first as Hatross) demo entitled "A look at tomorrow" by a song from the british punk band Discharge.It was the second demo entitled by a song by Discharge,a band to which Alex wanted to give a tribute.The demo had 7 tracks,a new version of "Napalm fields" and the cover of Discharge plus 5 new tracks.The band was totally reborn,and a lot of gig followed.The demo was released as a cassette release in March 1993 by an indie-label "Forum Mladih",with the same title and the addition of 8 live tracks and a studio version of "Bigmouths sucks" from the Devastation demo.The band played a lot of gigs during 1993 and 1994,until the beginning of 1995,when Florijan and Davor leaves the band.Alex,Chriss and Vedran decided to continue as a trio,which was a very wise decision.They continued with playing gigs,contemporary playing also in two very important projects:the Punk-rock band Antitodor I Talenti,and the somethingcore band Leukkemiaa (www.myspace.com/leukkemiaa).In the winter of 1996,the band recorded their last recording,a three track demo containing two rerecordings from the previous demo and one new track,Sickman,which appeared on some compilations all over Europe. The demo was again recorded in the EAR-Studio,and was unfortunately the last demo recorded there.The band played few more gigs,until March 13th 1997,when they played the last gig,in the city of Rijeka,the city where the band (as Devastation) played their first gig 9 years and 11 months before.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hatross">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
