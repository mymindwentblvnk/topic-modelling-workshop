Electro-ambient with a hint of rhythmic noise. Founded in Switzerland in 1999 by Alessandro Zampieri.

Stendeck is an electronic act bouncing between ambient parts, distorted beats and noisy keys with the presence of acoustic instruments opening warm landscapes to the listenerâ€™s ears.

The name Stendeck is a variation of STENDEC, the final strange Morse code radio message sent by the plane Star Dust on August 2 1947 before its mysterious disappearance.

The meaning of the term STENDEC is still unknown, and has been interpreted in many ways.

One string of theories explains STENDEC to be one of a number of acronyms like "Starting En-Route Descent" or "Severe Turbulence Encountered Now Descending Emergency Crash-Landing", but none of these acronyms can be reliably documented for the era.
