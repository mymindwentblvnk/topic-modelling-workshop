There are multiple recording artists under the name Andras:

1) Andras is Andrew Wilson, a music producer, soundtrack composer, radio host and DJ from Melbourne, Australia.

2) ANDRAS are heading from the Ore Mountains, Saxony, Germany and have been formed in 1994. In contrast to their early style, playing raw Black Metal with satanic lyrical themes, the musical style nowadays can be described as Epic-Pagan Black Metal.

After dismissing his bandmates due to personal reasons in Summer 2013, Count Damien Nightsky will continue the band with former members and long time friends Occulta Mors (known from the band "Nachtfalke" amongst others) and Bileeam (from "Ancient Wargod").

Their discography is containing five demo-recordings and six full-lenght albums. The latest one being 'Warlord', released in 2010 via Einheit Produktionen.

In 2014 they re-released their iconic album "...of Old Wisdom" containing tracks of the "Legends ..." demo as bonus tracks. It comes as a noble and limited digipack version with completely new and appropriate artwork and layout.
