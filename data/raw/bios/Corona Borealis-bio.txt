Founded in 1996 by Kristian Nordeide and Ronny Hovland (e.g. Ares of Aeternus) This band draws inspiration from medieval sources as well as modern European folk music. The song structures are based on a modern approach and no attempts are made at making an ``authentic`` sound. Corona Borealis play dark mood music and blend in dance music from pagan sources. For most of the material accoustic instruments are used, but the band also experiment with other soundscapes - using loops and low pitched synthetic drones etc. to accentuate their musical vocabulary. - EM:TMA

The band changed their name to Dovinia in 2007. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Corona+Borealis">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
