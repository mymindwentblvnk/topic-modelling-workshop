EAV was an Austrian band formed in 1977 by Thomas Spitzer, Eik Breit, Nino Holm and Anders Stenmo. EAV stands for "(die) Erste Allgemeine Verunsicherung", which means "First General Bewilderment/Unsettling/Uninsurance".

"Verunsicherung" is German for "bewilderment/the process of getting upset/unsettled", a pun that plays on the fact that the opposite of it ,"Versicherung", commonly means "insurance", and less commonly "assurance/ensurance/affirmation". In fact, the band's name is an allusion to the now defunct Austrian insurance company "Erste Allgemeine Versicherungs-AGâ€œ.

The band's humorous lyrics often contain hints of social criticism. Their songs Afrika (Ist der Massa gut bei Kassa) (1983), Burli (1987) and S'Muaterl (1990) were boycotted by radio stations in Austria and Germany because of the lyrical content.

The band's final lineup consisted of Klaus Eberhartinger (vocals), Thomas Spitzer (guitar, background vocals), Kurt Keinrath (guitar, bass guitar), Alvis Reid (bass guitar), Franz Kreimer (keyboard) and Aaron Thier (drums). The band split in 2019 with their last concert at the Viennese City Hall on September 14.
