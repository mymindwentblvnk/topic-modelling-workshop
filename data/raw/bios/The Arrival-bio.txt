The Arrival bounced onto the scene in April 2008 with the release of their self written, produced, and recorded EP, "Believe The Hype". The band's innate ability for songwriting was apparent, and "Believe The Hype" quickly garnered a steadily growing buzz both online and throughout the music industry. Following the release of "Believe The Hype" and a few months of touring independently, the band was picked up by The Artery Foundation Artist Management Group and The Agency Group. This enabled the band to tour steadily and to begin building a solid fanbase all over the country. After 6 US tours in 2008, the band is currently working on new and exciting music at their home studio in Madison, Alabama. Expect to see The Arrival back on tour early 2009!  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Arrival">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
