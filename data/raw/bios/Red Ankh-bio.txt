Red Ankh is a one man metal side project of Shyft formed in the United States in the year 2004.  The project is highly experimental, including (but not in every song) elements of black metal, chiptune, dance, death metal, folk, gabber, gothic, industrial, power metal, progressive,  symphonic metal, thrash metal, and trance.  Shyft often refers to the Red Ankh project as being 'diamond' or 'heavy diamond', a sort of tongue in cheek self made genre implying that (greatly due to the heavy, distorted bass drums often used) the music is tougher than metal or any ordinary rock.

Early works were mostly instrumental, while future projects in the making have been fitted with the intent to bear more vocals.  The goal of the project is to break down genre boundaries, keep music inventive, and inspire.
