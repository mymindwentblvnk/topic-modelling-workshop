Salamina based SOULFADE issued the demos 'Marked Angels' in 1999 and 'Sculpture Of Human Innocence' in 2000. The band, fronted by singer Panayotis Trikalitis and operating in Power Metal territory, had been created in May of 1998. Early line up changes witnessed the introduction of drummer Dimitris Dimisetis in June of 1999, replacing Andreas Milios, and bass player Giorgos Kaparaliotis being superseded by Dimitris Giokas in August of 2000. However, guitarist Jim Boustis would decamp in January of 2001. SOULFADE would then introduce second guitarist Nikos Gioka. Meantime SOULFADE founder guitarist Akis Dimisetis, retaining ties to his priority act, would join Death Metal act ETHEREAL as a session member. Giokas bailed out in mid 2002, as did Panayotis Trikalitis. SOULFADE found a new singer in Chris Begnis. Soulfade disbanded later that year. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Soulfade">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
