There are multiple artists using this name.

1. After Forever (Netherlands)
Dutch metal band that was previously named Apocalypse when they were first formed in 1995. They can be described as a symphonic metal band with influences from classical music, doom metal, gothic metal, power metal and progressive metal. After Forever uses mixed vocal styles, consisting of death grunts (Sander Gommans), soprano vocals (Floor Jansen) and occasionally clean male vocals (Bas Maas). 

The band consists of Floor Jansen (vocals), Sander Gommans (guitar, guttural voices), Bas Maas (guitars), Luuk van Gerven (bass), Joost van den Broek (keyboards) and Andr√© Borgman (drums).

In 2002 Mark Jansen quit After Forever and subsequently assembled the band Epica.

In 2006 After Forever made their departure from Transmission records after spending 10 years with them. The album "Mea Culpa" has been made without the approval of the band and therefore isn't supported by After forever. "Mea Culpa" contains a collection of After Forever singles, remixes and favourites separated in two chapters with guest appearances with celebrities such as Sharon Den Adel (Within Temptation), Damian Wilson (Ayreon) and Marco Hietala (Nightwish/Tarot)

On the 5th of Febuary 2009 the band officially announced that they would be disbanding after 15 years.

3. After Forever (Maryland, USA)
Hailing from Baltimore Maryland, After Forever was founded for the sole purpose of recreating through live performance the music of the legendary Black Sabbath. Comprised of veteran musicians, After Forever celebrates this music with a passion borne through nearly three decades of formal study, influence and outright fanaticism. We then employ gear and amplification that was designed to meet the tonal demands of Black Sabbath themselves.
