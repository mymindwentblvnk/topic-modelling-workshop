Dargoron is a Power metal/Progressive metal band from Smederevo, Serbia. It was formed in 2002 by Nikola Janković, Zlatko Nikolić, Aleksandar Jelenić and Darko Lazarević. In January 2005, the band recorded songs for their first album but the band released the album only after they won the "Demo Masters" competition, organized by Radio Beograd 202, voted the best band by both jury and the audience. The long-expected album release occurred on June 20, 2006, and the album was released under the ACTIV TIME Records label. The band played as special guests on the 40th Gitarijada, the longest-lasting rock festival in Serbia.
New album, announced to be released during 2008, features song "Duša ratnika", recorded with guest vocalists Zoran Lalović Lotke (Lotke & Lavirint frontman and a former Kraljevski Apartman frontman) and Max (Nightfall frontman).
