Raised in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, Sandy Dillon describes her music style as "jazz-punk western blues".

She began music with piano at the age of six. After studying music at Berkelee College of Music, she relocated to New York and played piano in gay bars and supper clubs. She also portrayed Janis Joplin in a Broadway musical.

She firstly signed with the label Elektra in the early '90s. Her music was met with resistance from the label. Indeed, her first two albums were unreleased despite the production work of Mick Ronson. The label finally accepted to release her third attempt, Dancing of the Freeway. Elektra dropped her contract shortly after the release.

Sandy Dillon continued to record in her home studio, with the help of her husband and collaborator Steve Bywaters. In 1996, she released a second album, Skating, released on the independant label Bonjour.

Then she released East Overshoe in 2001, just after Bywaters died of a sudden heart attack. After the death of her husband, Dillon was left on her own for the first time in more than a decade. In the summer of 2002, she started to work on a new album. In 2004, Nobody's Sweetheart is released under the label One Little Indian.

In 2006, Sandi Dillon released Pull the Strings. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sandy+Dillon">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
