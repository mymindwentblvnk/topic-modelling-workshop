Hailing from Edinburgh, Araya is the solo work of the Inverness born electronica producer Keir MacCulloch. 

Signed to famed Scottish alternative music label Benbecula Records, Araya has been a "notable force" in the Scottish electronic music scene.

His sell out album "The Bridge Of Hesitation" was an underground hit, taking Araya's live show all over the country and abroad. 

His follow up release "Whilst We Try EP" is due out on 26th October. 
This trip proves to be a much more focused and dancefloor-friendly affair. From the lush guitar-laden opener "Sergio Leone", to the orchestral synth fusion of "Duty Paid", the EP merges organic melodies with super slick production. With great response from homeland and European crowds, the EP proves to be ideal for both headphones and the club
