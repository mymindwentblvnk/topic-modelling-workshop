Kerogen is an electronic artist from London and South East United Kingdom. He is a current uni student and has been making music since 2005. He started off by sampling during his days at college, making hip hop tracks; later he encountered a different sound which allowed his style to develop into the sound one can hear today. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kerogen">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
