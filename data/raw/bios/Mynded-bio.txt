The band was founded in 2011. 
The original idea for the band name was “Mind Dead”, but there were several reasons why they chose MYNDED over the regular spelling. Most bands out there have got regular English words as band names. And there’s nothing wrong with that, but a “name” doesn’t have to be a defined word which you can look up in a dictionary. And because there is no such word as “mynded”, it suddenly becomes interesting and unique. And that’s what we want to be. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mynded">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
