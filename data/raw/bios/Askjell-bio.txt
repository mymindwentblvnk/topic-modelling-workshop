Only 25 years and a rather unknown name, Askjell is no rookie to the music business, considered as one of the biggest pop producers in the thriving music city of Bergen, Norway. He’s already worked with artists like Aurora and Sigrid.
There is almost no music genre he is unfamiliar with. His musical journey project began at an early age being exposed to music through is dad’s underground dance-records, buying himself a Casio keyboard and getting addicted to composing and music theory at the age of ten.
A major turning point for Askjell was when he discovered music production. He was studying so hard that his teacher (now being his manager!) told him to work in his studio instead of being at school.
With his solo project Askjell wants to challenge the sometimes shallow nature of the world of popular music in which he resides – though he knows that he wouldn’t have been able to make his music if it hadn’t been for the craftsmanship and structure the world of pop and urban has given him. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Askjell">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
