April Fish, the avant-garde duo, is made up of Katie Morton, spritian keyboard virtuoso and lyricist extraordinaire, and Wellington Warr guitarist John Costa. They appeared, according to legend, amongst the drab grey brickwork of Wellington’s Cuba Mall, circa 2010 and proceeded to drive a stake through the heart of a generation who grew up listening to True Bliss and their manufactured ilk. 

In their first full length release they have given birth to a Kiwi album unlike anything you’ve ever heard before.  

Part sci-fi jazz melodrama, part cabaret-rock fever dream, "Blurred" gleefully milks all the musical sacred cows Kiwi artists have traditionally been afraid to, while spawning a unique New Zealand Gothicism. Blurred is at some points space opera, at others an unapologetic insight into New Zealand subculture attitudes towards status quo art; its poignant introspection and need to defy convention.    

Blurred is a bone-rattling, brain-shattering, but undeniably beautiful, ride.
