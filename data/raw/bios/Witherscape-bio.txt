WITHERSCAPE is a project that sees Dan Swanö teaming with another multi-instrumentalist,, Ragnar Widerberg, creating a concept album, which should musically appeal not only to fans of earlier Swanö's works with Edge Of Sanity and Nightingale, or his solo album Moontower, but also attract friends of progressive atmospheric contemporary Metal, in the vein of Opeth or Amorphis. 

Swanö commented on the upcoming WITHERSCAPE album as follows:

"I have just completed the final mixes of the first album from my new project WITHERSCAPE. Fans of my Moontower album and the catchier parts of Edge Of Sanity won't be disappointed! I sing, both clean and growl, play drums and keyboards. Ragnar Widerberg plays all guitars & bass and has co-written almost all the tracks with me."

WITHERSCAPE's The Inheritance was released in July 2013 via Century Media Records.
