A USA three member death metal band from Minnesota's Twin Cites that is well known in the underground. They remain one of the very few "Satanic" bands that relied heavily upon multiple vocal overlaying to achieve its trademark "demon" or "infernal" caustic sound effect and there are blatant uses of a pitch shifter within parts of their earlier recordings. The band also achieved much of its sound by choosing to record only on analog and by keeping all scratch tracks to give the albums a more dirty and "live" feel. They released one demo titled 'Fallen to the Pits' in 1995 under the name Ossuary. The band then changed their name to Ossuary Insane prior to the release of 'Demonize the Flesh' in early 1997 and their subsequent disbanding. 

The band suffered multiple line-up changes after the shotgun suicide of the original bassist in 1994. Internal struggles and conflicts between members throughout the band's life also left their sound in constant and inconsistent change. While the style of guitar riffs and structures remained intact, the bands vocal approach varied greatly with the addition in 1999 of a full time frontman, Shane Patten (Brick, Si6ks, Ghost Hook). 

Although with obvious variance from previous recordings both vocally and in its deviation from the bands usual raw and stripped down sound, 'The Cauldrons of Aborted Flesh' highlighted a more fine tuned and precise Death/Thrash act that proves to be one of the bands most competent. 

Forming and reforming, with only the founder K.S. Jacobsen (West Wall, Convulsus USA) and co-founder C. Hanson remaining as the base members of the band until late 2006 when the three original members reunited. A three song scratch demo titled 'Bottom Feeder' was recorded but unfortunately, old animosities and continued directional conflict forced the band to be permanently shelved.     

The band shared the stage with many of the more well known bands of the genre such as Arch Enemy, Nile, Anal Blast, Kataklysm, Absu, and Morbid Angel during the mid to late 90's and early 2000's.
