Dorothy Moore (born 13 October 1946, Jackson, Mississippi) is an American pop, R&B, and soul singer.

Moore began singing with her church choir at the age of five, and eventually became a soloist. She formed a vocal group The Poppies who had hits in 1966 with the songs "Lullaby of Love" and "He's Ready".

By the mid-1970s Moore had begun a career as a solo vocalist, and released a series of best-selling singles and albums. Among her hits of this period was "Misty Blue" (featuring backing vocals by her "Poppies" bandmate Fern Kinney). The song reached number 1 on the Billboard R&B chart and number 3 on the pop chart, saving her record label, Malaco, from bankruptcy. Her next two singles were "I Believe You" (later covered by The Carpenters) and a cover version of the Willie Nelson song "Funny How Time Slips Away". Both songs reached the R&B Top 10.

Moore stopped performing for several years, returning in 1986 with a gospel album Giving It Straight To You. She went back to her original label Malaco in the 1990s, where her albums included More Moore (1997). As of 2002 she continues to perform, and has released albums on Farish Street Records of Mississippi.
