Wilson Tanner—the duo of Andras Fox and John Tanner, aka Eleventeen Eston — released 69 via Growing Bin Records in April 2016. 

It's Andras Fox's second appearance on Basso's label, following the 2014 vinyl release of Overworld. The relaxing full-length is a collaboration between Andras (real name Andy Wilson) and fellow Australian John Tanner, and it was recorded near Perth, where the "Swan River meets the Indian Ocean," the label says. The press release goes on to describe the idyllic setting, noting that 69 was recorded using "an innovative al fresco recording technique. Andy and John invited members of the local animal community to join their jam sessions, saving a Blue Swimmer Crab from the flames of the barbecue and encouraging him to claw the ivories." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wilson+Tanner">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
