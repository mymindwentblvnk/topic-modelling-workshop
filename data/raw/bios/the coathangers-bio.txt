The Coathangers are a rock band from Atlanta, Georgia. They are: The Crook Kid Coathanger: Vocals, guitar, tamborine; Minnie Coathanger: Vocals, bass, tamborine; Rusty Coathanger: Vocals, drums; Bebe Coathanger: Vocals, keys.

The band formed in 2006 as a joke, played a house show and were asked to open for The Hiss on the strength of their performance.  The name was chosen for its vulgarity - an irreverent take on abortions - though all band members are pro-choice.

Their playfulness continues into their songs, with titles such as 'Don't Touch My Shit, Nestle In My Boobies and "Shut the Fuck Up."  They released a 7 inch on Atlanta's Die Slaughterhaus Records and their first full length self titled on  Rob's House Records.  

After taking time to tour and putting out another 7 inch on Seattle based Suicide Squeeze Records, the Coathangers released their second full length SCRAMBLE in April 2009. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Coathangers">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
