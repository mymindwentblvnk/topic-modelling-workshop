GOOOOOSE (that's with five O's) is the solo project of Shanghai-based musician Han Han. He is the front man of experimental rock/electronica band Duck Fight Goose (Chinese: 鸭打鹅; formed in 2009), member of Lava Ox Sea, and from 2006 to 2010 he ran the DIY label Miniless Recordings, which released 20 albums by artists from Shanghai and surroundings.

Starting out in the Indie rock genre, he has increasingly shifted towards futuristic electronica. This transition began with Duck Fight Goose's second album Club Zvkvnft in 2016, and his solo work has continued down that path, paralleling the solo career of his partner, and fellow Duck Fight Goose member, 33EMYBW. His multi-instrumental approach to making music usually leads the audience into a place where ambient soundscape, heavily synthesized texture and syncopated rhythms find their harmony, yet still fighting with each other sometimes.

His 2019 album "Rusted Silicon" on Shanghai’s SVBKVLT label – featuring remixes by Samuel Kerridge, Nahash and Sote – has gained praise from across the board. Boomkat described it as such: "Brilliantly following his nose along ribboning routes of rhythmic investigation, Gooooose plays on a sweet spot between the sort of frenetic, late-‘90s/early-‘00s breaksploitation of Venetian Snares, AFX or Hrvatski, and the kind of clipped, hyper-modern computer music you’d expect to find on FLUF or from Co La."

Apart from making music, Han Han is also a visual artist and software developer. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/GOOOOOSE">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
