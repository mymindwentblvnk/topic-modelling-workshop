Technical and Progressive Thrash Metal band from the Faroe Island.

Inspired by religious ignorance, prejudice and abhorrence, The Apocryphal Order from Tórshavn presents a discharge of Progressive Death/Thrash Metal fury with all their lyrics written in english. 
The band formed in early 2010 with the vision of bringing some bone crushing Death Metal to the already growing metal scene in the Faroes. 
From playing their first concert back in July 2010, TAO went on to record their first album in December that same year at Kohlekeller studio in Darmstadt, Germany.
