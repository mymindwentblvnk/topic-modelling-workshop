Destitute Savior originally formed with Nino Negri on vocals and was replaced with Lawrence Nodier (who moved on to No Destinatin and Daddy Y Belt and now sings for The Bump Daddyz) before the first demo was recorded. This line up disbanded in 1989 and in 1992 Nino Negri and Mark Dubisson reformed the band with a new rhythm section. Nino and Rob are currently in Fiendance. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Destitute+Savior">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
