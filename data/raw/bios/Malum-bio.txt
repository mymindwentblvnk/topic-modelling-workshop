There are three bands under the name of Malum - one finnish, one polish and one swedish
1: FINNISH

Malum is a Black Metal band Turku, Finland. Formed in 2013.



2: POLISH

The idea of MaluM was born about 2004 in N.N's and Marduks brains. At the beginning the band was supported by Ruanda(drums), Nazroth(drums) and Letun(guitar) but still new problems with uncomplete squad were stopping their plans connected with playing concerts and recording materials in studio. It lasts till 2006 when N.N. and Marduk found actually band members. From this year their sick and dim visions of world found a way to see a daylight. 
In 2007 they have recorded a demo - now unaviable for mortals. Afterwards Nohorn left the band. On his place N.N. found new member - Orion and they're planning to enter the studio again in the spring 2008.



2: SWEDISH

Malum started out as a loud, raw and unprocessed hardcore duo in 2002. A few years later the band started their transformation into what became a brutal, five-man metal outfit. In Januari 2005 the group marked the beginning of a new era with the new name Malum and with the release of the "Angel Descending" demo.
Over the years they produced a handful more demos which received critical acclaim in the biggest Metal/Hardrock magazines in Scandinavia. They proudly carry a rumor of producing explosive and energetic live shows. Now yet another milestone in the history of Malum has been erected; in mid 2008 a joint effort with Malum, Frankfurts Forensic Alliance and the german label Ampire Records was put into the works. The outcome of this, a split-EP aptly coronated "Persona To Object In Six Steps", has been released on the 1st of April '09. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Malum">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
