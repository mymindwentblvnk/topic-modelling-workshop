Aaron Dilloway is an experimental musician. He has been releasing and recording music since the age of 16. He is a former guitarist and tape manipulator for the noise rock band Wolf Eyes, which he left in 2005 to live most of that year in Kathmandu, Nepal. While his wife did her graduate work there, he roamed the streets recording every sound he could, many of which are used in his recent recordings and performances. Currently he runs the noise record label, record store and mailorder Hanson Records, which he began in Ann Arbor, Michigan in 1994, but has been based in Oberlin, Ohio since February 2008. He performs solo using eight track tapes and vocal sounds, and records modular synthesizer music as Spine Scavenger. Recently, he has played with an ever-changing cast of sound artists under the name The Nevari Butchers. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Aaron+Dilloway">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
