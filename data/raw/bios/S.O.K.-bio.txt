There are a few bands claiming "S.O.K." as their name.

1) Brutal Death Metal band from Spain, A Coruña, Galicia.

2.) Band S.O.K. is from Novi sad, a smal town in Serbia (ex Yugoslavia). The main idea behind S.O.K. is to promote the kind of music which is not present in rock music, in Novi sad and Serbia. If we had to define our music by genre it would be noiserockPUNK ( garage noise ). The band line up: Milan Sindelic - ex Maltreat, ex member of Dreddup, Schmiz), Krajovan Aleksandar ( ex member of Dreddup, ex Lowspin, Franja Kluz) Izulijano Djakometi (ex Epigram, ex member of Dreddup, ex Adrennaline ). Lyrics are about certain situations in life. S.O.K. doesn't flirt with other musical genres which are dishonest and have no artistic values. We are underground, we fight for it!!!! We'll leave it to you to get what does S.O.K. stand for…
