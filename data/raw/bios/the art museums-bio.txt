The Art Museums tell sordid tales of artists, lovers & poseurs with cult new wave jangle. Bay Area psych burnouts, Josh Alper & Glenn Donaldson (Skygreen Leopards) converged in San Francisco in the Summer of ‘09 to record Anglophile jams on a Tascam 388 tape machine (state of the art home-recording circa ‘85). Rough Frame is their debut LP for the Woodsist label. They would make a hi-fi studio record if they had the money, but reviewers would probably still say it was lo-fi. The Art Museums ARE into: art, poetry, WHAAM records & films about Mods…The Art Museums ARE NOT into: flared trousers, drip coffee, dirty sneakers.
