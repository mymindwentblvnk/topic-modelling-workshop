Abner Daniel Rojas (ROJAZ)  was born on May 13, 1991 in Jacksonville, Florida. He was raised in a Christian household where his father, Carlos Rojas, was a minister and his mother, Ivonne Stout, was a pianist and a choir director. Abner was not an only child, he has two older sisters, Veronica and Nichole. ROJAZ fell in love with music while living in St. Cloud/Kissimee, Florida. At the age of nine, ROJAZ was inspired by a female rapper, known as Big Nicky, who lived in the same apartment complex. She would rap in a form of poetry in front of the community. Since then, ROJAZ began writing. Notebooks after notebooks full of rhymes and ideas, he started to wonder if this was something that he was meant to do. That same year, Abner's parents divorced, which caused many conflicts and turmoil in his life. His mother wanted to get him and his sisters out of Florida for a better life and better opportunities such as education, environment, etc. Around the age of twelve, ROJAZ and his family moved to the small city of Mankato, Minnesota. Throughout high school, ROJAZ participated in his school choir and continued to write his own music as well as freestyle rap with his friends. He has always felt that music was a way to relieve stress and cope with his problems.After he finally realized that he needed to pursue his music and show people what he is capable of, he decided that wanted to release his first mix tape. He searched and searched for producers who would help him with this project, and finally stumbled upon Producer, Andrew Winzenburg. Approximately one year later, Postmodern was released. He is now working on new singles, and eventually, another mix tape. Hip hop lives in him, and this will not be the last of his music that you will hear.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rojaz">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
