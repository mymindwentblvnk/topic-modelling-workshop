Brock Berrigan is the alias of a drunk-savant musician/producer out of Astoria, Queens.  Berrigan dons a rooster mask in his photo shoots/music videos and spends the rest of his time alone, meticulously plugging away in his basement studio. Sure, the hip-hop cockerel mask adds an element of silly pretension, but in talking to Brock one can tell that the anonymous persona is less a stunt aimed toward gaining popularity through mystique than a self-conscious departure from his person. Brock doesn’t have to apologize for Brock or risk disapproval; he simply wants his listeners to enjoy the music. Brock’s music unbridles his bizarre imagination giving him a more appropriate outlet to that which he otherwise suppresses.

Brock has been recording music in one form or another since he was 13 years old. Much of his adolescence was spent playing guitar and touring the East Coast in a band. Over the past few years Brock has focused on recording hip-hop beats. He’s amassed an impressive catalog, releasing ten LPs totaling approximately 150+ tracks with over 1,000 cutting room floor experiments. His first album, 2011 Beat Tape, came out in February 2011 and his most recent work, Chapter 10, came out on March 24th, 2015. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Brock+Berrigan">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
