The project was initiated in early 2006 as a fusion of different styles within the framework of Heavy Metal. With the following composition: Vocals, guitar, bass, drums and keyboard, is devoted almost exclusively to composition and rehearsal, except for a few acoustic performers.

In 2007, the band still had no clear direction, which is why underwent several modifications to its members.

In 2009, SOLSTICIO made numerous appearances at festivals with various bands from the local scene, both in Capital and Gan Buenos Aires, and some in other cities (Mar del Plata and Chivilcoy).
In May 2009 SOLSTICIO had the opportunity to be the opening band for Tarja Turunen’s show at the Teatro de Flores, for this event the band has recorded a little demo made of two songs (Free and Fairytale) wich later included a cover (blank Infinity Epica).

During 2010 the band is devoted less to the live shows to focus on recording their first EP study and began to experience influences including tango to achieve a signature sound, which also made reference to its city of origin, Buenos Aires.
Also has participated in the Nightwishmaster Fest, Dark Wings Fest and Noche Bastarda Live 3.
By late 2010, with a new lineup with two guitars (and change of some members), the band made several presentations in Capital Federal and in Dolores.
