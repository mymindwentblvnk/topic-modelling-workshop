Brooklyn female musical collective Effi Briest are named after a 19th century German fictional anti-heroine, a victim of circumstance whose spirit nevertheless survives intact.

As one might expect, though joyfully played, there is an undercurrent of melancholy in their music. There have been comparisons to early Siousxie, but its primitive animism is as evocative of late period Slits. Still a comparatively young band they are definitely evolving their own identity. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Effi+Briest">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
