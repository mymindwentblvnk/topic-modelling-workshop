Clapton-based singer-songwriter Millie Turner is making waves with her fluid, indie electronica. While dancefloor-ready, her songs are still thought-provoking. Her first track, ‘Underwater’, was written the day after Trump’s victory and longs for the possibility that we could set up a better world in the sea. ‘We are young, we are afraid, but we are free,’ she sings, with the kind of youthful idealism that turns older cynics green with envy.
She’s released a further four songs and, now that her A-levels are out the way, is able to pursue writing and performing full time. But despite her spades of talent, Millie’s musical path came as a surprise to her. Growing up in Clapton, the middle child between two sisters, Millie played the piano and sang with her siblings but never took it seriously.
At 16, she approached family friend and musician David Turley in the hope of getting some guitar lessons. One half of husband-and-wife pop duo Lovers Electric, Turley quickly clocked Millie’s vocal ability and the pair started writing and recording together in his studio at Clapton’s Round Chapel. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Millie+Turner">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
