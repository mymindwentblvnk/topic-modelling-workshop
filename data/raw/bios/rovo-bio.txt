Rovo is a psychedelic rock-jazz band founded in 1996 in Tokyo by former Boredoms guitarist Seiichi Yamamoto (山本精一), electric violinist Yuji Katsui (勝井祐二), and synthesizer/effects technician Tatsuki Masuko (益子樹), with Jin Harada (原田仁) on bass guitar, Hiroshi Nakanishi (中西宏司) on synths, and featuring two drummers/percussionists, the prolific Yasuhiro Yoshigaki (芳垣安洋) (of legendary improv noise group ground-zero) and Yoichi Okabe (岡部洋一).

They describe themselves as "Man Drive Trance", due to their hands-on methods of creating a kind of music usually produced entirely electronically. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/ROVO">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
