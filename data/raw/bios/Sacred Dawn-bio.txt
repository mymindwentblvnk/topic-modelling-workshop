A New Breed of Melodic Prog/Power Metal
In 2005 Sacred Dawn broke out into Chicagoâ€™s metal music scene as a welcomed return to classic metal with a progressive spin.  With an innovative mix of heavy metal and hard rock and a unique blend of vocal harmonies, Sacred Dawn has been said to deliver one of the most original progressive metal musical experiences heard since the dawn of true prog metal.  Sacred Dawn pulls their influence from bands such as Dream Theater, Iron Maiden, Nevermore, Queensryche, Savatage, Fates Warning and many others.  From their numerous live appearances across the Midwest to playing alongside international acts such as Symphony X, Testament, Cage, Firewind, Kamelot, and Epica, Sacred Dawn has garnered critical acclaim as well as fans around the world.
Several years after the debut release of Gears of the Machine: A new beginning and after much time in the studio, Sacred Dawn is excited to announce the 2011 release of A Madness Within available worldwide with distribution through Dark Star Records.  A Madness Within is a dark and provocative story with music that captures and pervades.
