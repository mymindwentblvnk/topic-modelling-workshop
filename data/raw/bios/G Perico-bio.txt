Resurrecting the distinctive sounds of early-'90s West Coast  G-funk, rapper G Perico connected the streets and the studio with his cinematic storytelling and observations from South Central Los Angeles.

Born Jeremy Nash, Perico was involved in gang life from a young age. His first tapes were even issued while he was in jail. With a delivery similar to  DJ Quik,  Too $hort, and  Eazy-E, Perico started to build a following with 2015's Tha Innerprize 2. The next year, he issued his breakthrough mixtape, Shit Don't Stop. In 2017, Perico released a trio of efforts, starting with his All Blue mixtape -- a reference to his affiliation with the Crips -- which he issued on his own indie label, So Way Out. He followed with a notable collaborative album, which found him joining forces with Bloods-affiliated Jay Worthy and producer Cardo as G-Worthy. Before the end of the year, Perico released 2 Tha Left, featuring single " Everybody" and appearances by Nef the Pharaoh, Mozzy, Curren$y, and frequent collaborator Polyester. 2018 brought the collaborative single "Colors" with Freddie Gibbs and Mozzy, followed by the  Guess What? EP. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/G+Perico">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
