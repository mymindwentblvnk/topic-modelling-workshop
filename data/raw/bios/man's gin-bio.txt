Originally from Colorado, USA, Man's Gin began in 2005 as a two-man band comprising of Erik Wunder (Cobalt) and guitarist Clint Kamerzell. In 2009 duo split and Erik Wunder began to tour Europe, Great Britan, and New York drumming for Jarboe (Swans, A Perfect Circle, Neurosis). Where he met current bassist Josh Lozano (Inswarm, Fashion Week, Meifumado). They've been gigging out the newly reformed Man's Gin lineup around Brooklyn as a duo up until the recruitment of Scott Edward (Tumbling Planet, Meifumado), an underground artist who added the piano and guitar to their sound. 

Together Wunder, Edward and Lozano recorded their debut album Smiling Dogs, produced by Colin Marston (Behold the Arctopus, Gorguts, Dysrhythmia, Krallice) at Thousand Caves Studio which was released in 2010 by Profound Lore Records. Their second album, Rebellion Hymns, was released in 2013.
