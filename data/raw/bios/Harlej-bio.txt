The group Harlej was formed around 1995. Their musical genre is crazy-rock. The founders Vladimír Šafránek and Antonín Rauer are the authors of many rhythmical melodies which are put together with lyrics by Tomáš Miřacký to give the band their originality.

The band is also composed of guitar player Ota Hereš (also a member of the group Alkehol), drummer Daniel Šůra, and bass player Vítek Fiala. In the year 1995 they came out with their debut album Aj mena ou bejby hel.

In the year 2002, the band changed their composition and only the founders remained. New members came from Debustrol – bass player Kolins, guitar player Martin Volák and drummer Libor Fanta. With the new members changes also the style of the music. Another successful CD came out.
In the year 2006, Vláďa Šafránek left the group and Tomáš Hrbáček took his place.
