AFFRONT began in 1997, appropriately enough playing their first show on Halloween. What began as an initial outlet to alleviate boredom for 4 Washington, D.C. kids turned into a seven year legacy of two seven inches, two EP's, two full lengths, eight drummers, and a dozen tours across the US and Canada. Playing with hundreds of bands, including AFI, American Nightmare, Rise Against, and Poison the Well, one can still travel around North America and find faded "AFFRONT" stickers in major cities. Artists such as Jacob Bannon (Converge, Cave In), Linas Garsys (AFI, Nerve Agents), and Matt Rinks (Jesuseater) helped to paint their aesthetic - and with the support of friends such as Mike "Phyte" Mowery, Issa Daio, Ken Olden, Al Eisenbart, Brian McTernan, and many many others, AFFRONT was able to bring their vision to life. Shortly before hammering the final nail in the coffin in 2004, members of AFFRONT went on to play in various bands, such as the Five O' Clock Heroes, The Reveling, When Tigers Fight, Good Clean Fun, Porch Mob, The Goddamn Wolves, and The Scare.
