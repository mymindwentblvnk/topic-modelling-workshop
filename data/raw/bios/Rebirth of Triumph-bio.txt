Rebirth of Triumph formed in mid 2010 in Bukittinggi, Indonesia started playing music in the name of metalcore and try to dig it at simple studio named Reptile studio record. After that we try to make a song called Dread Breath (our first song) and we pretty much got a positive impression of this song. And in early 2011, we are determined to make an album of our songs with the theme of fear, sin, repentance, forgiveness, hopeless, and etc.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rebirth+of+Triumph">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
