Somnus Aeternus is a Doom/Death Metal band from Brno, Czech Republic formed in 2007. After a few years of line-up changes and forming the material, the band reworked their old demo material with the new line-up in 2011 and soon after started to record their debut album.
 
The first album called “On the Shores of Oblivion” was finally recorded and released in 2012 by Russian doom-metal label Solitude Productions. It contains older songs from the early era, which have a very strong (but groovy) doom element mixed with many other influences, as well as newer songs, which are much more complex and dificult to describe in terms of common genre names. The lyrics and the whole band concept revolves around the idea of similarity (and to a certain degree interchangeability) of sleep and death, which goes hand in hand with realizing one’s mortality and all the implications arising from such an understanding of life. The music of Somnus Aeternus should not go unnoticed to fans of Swallow the Sun, Agalloch, Opeth, Katatonia, Saturnus, Arcturus or Insomnium.
