The Proselyte was formed in late 2006 in Boston by Alec Rodriguez (drums/lead vox), Nicholas Wolf (guitars/ b.vox), Brad Macomber(bass/noises), and Mitchell Belch(guitars/b.vox). The debut s/t album combines the riff heavy sludge of The Melvins with the haunting melodies of Alice In Chains.

"The playing is subtle and the sumptuous music is expansive and thoughtful." 
- Linda Laban (Boston Metro)

"The band managed to reach an impressive level of intensity in each song. The band seemed out of breath as early as the first song's end, but immediately jumped into the next song, regaining their energy and launching into another murderously loud number. While the audience was small, the performance was rock solid, filling the room with grinding, raucous metal."
-Roman Lojko (Northeast Performer live review)
