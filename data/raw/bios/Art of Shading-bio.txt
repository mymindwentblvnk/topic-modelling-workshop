This shadow that creates our life, and that stuff is sounding. This art of shadow show these to others. It is a new birth for the feelings and emotions in the group. This oppressive atmosphere of heavy guitar riffs and the symphony of keyboards, which merge into one unique harmony Dark Metal. This expression of extreme vocals and the high purity of the voice. Are musicians who live in this music. This Art of Shading.
