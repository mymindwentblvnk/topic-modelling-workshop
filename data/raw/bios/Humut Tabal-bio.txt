Humut Tabal is a Black Metal group from the Texas Hill Country. The band formed in early 2009 when founding members Hravan (guitar,vocals) and Grimzaar (guitar, synth, vocals) decided to collaborate. Almost immediately afterward, drummer Njord joined and the group began composing and rehearsing material. In the spring of 2010, shortly after Humut Tabal released their debut EP "Gods ov Darkness, Hate, and Flame", bassist Scathrath joined for a brief spell, leaving in late September of the same year. In the spring of 2011, the grim Prokingu joined the ranks of the sinister outfit on bass guitar, allowing Humut Tabal to unleash unparalleled fury like never before. Humut Tabal plays a style of black metal heavily influenced (but not exclusively influenced) by the Scandinavian black metal groups of the 80s and 90s, such as Emperor, Mayhem, Satyricon, and Dissection. Other influences include bands such as Devourment and Cattle Decapitation; these influences bring a more maniacal, aggressive, and technical approach to Humut Tabalâ€™s traditional black metal base.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Humut+Tabal">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
