1) Silence Means Death was formed arround may 2007 and is a cocktail of 2 Belgian bands...Rik & Willy are playing in a d-beat band called Nahende Vernichtung and Jos was 1 of the "singers" in the crustpunk band Fart. Nahende Vernichtung and Fart went on tour together twice and on one of these tours some members of both bands deceided to form a band. We recorded some songs at the battlefield studio (cheers!!)and we released a split 7" with the crust youngsters from Oedeem......We are now working on some new stuff so stay tuned!! Cheers!!!
