Caitiff started out as an electronic/industrial band and is known for its many random shifts through genres, changing from modern post-black metal, to neofolk, to electronic pop and back to old school black metal within only few years. Andrew Young is also known for his numerous side-projects, some of which are Conveyor (modern death metal), Georgia Corpse Scandal (fun death metal), Really Nasty Papercut (fun grind), Dark Skies Over Norge (black metal parody), Stadt im Wipfel (experimental) or Aerielle (anim√©-based power metal).

Caitiff is now split-up and Aerielle is Andrew Young's main band today. The only side-project he still actively persues is Conveyor. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Caitiff">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
