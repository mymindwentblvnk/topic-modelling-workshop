Epping Forest is a portuguese metal band. They play a kind of blackened death metal with reminiscences of the scandinavian essence, and their actual ‘style’ is increasingly difficult to characterise: the horde drinks from a myriad of different fountains, starting with metal and more obscure music, but not excluding other genres altogether.  

Nevertheless, it could and should be said that Epping Forest plays fast and brutal, using and creating lots of atmospheric, mystic and extreme elements.
