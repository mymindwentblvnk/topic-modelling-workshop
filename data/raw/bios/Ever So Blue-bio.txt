Ever So Blue is the brainchild of Swedish, Gothenburg-based songwriter Jakob Ahlbom. Whilst the output under his real name combines a life-long passion for piano improvisation with an everlasting love for post-rock music, Ever So Blue acts as his unequivocal homage to the piano as a solo instrument. One could say Ever So Blue is where it all begins. An origin, or inception, where simplicity meets intimacy. The beautiful melodies stemming from Jakob’s fingertips are left pure and uncluttered, with clever subtle nuances creating the perceived variations in dynamics and rhythm. In 2019, his debut release “Fragment” achieved near overnight success as its four sonic chapters went on to amass over 6 million Spotify streams within one month. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ever+So+Blue">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
