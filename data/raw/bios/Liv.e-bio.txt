Liv.e, pronounced "Liv" (born Hailee Olivia Williams in Dallas, Texas) is an American singer-songwriter, rapper and producer who mixes facets of R&B, jazz, soul, and hip hop to create a sound that is wholly her own. Coupling her hypnotic voice and unique writing over dusty loops and sun soaked production, Liv.e makes songs that are both eclectic and timeless without sounding dated. While it's difficult to label Liv.e's music under one genre or scene, it is born out of production based on samples pulled from vinyl in Dallas record shops, southern rap, and her upbringing in Dallas with local DIY label Dolfin Records. She also raps under the alias Jade Fox, forming a supergroup with fellow Dolfin labelmate Lord Byron and Pink Siifu under the name Kryptonyte.

Liv.e started to garner attention with her 2017 project FRANK and 2018's Hoopdreams, which led to her supporting Earl Sweatshirt on the 2019 Fire It Up Tour alongside BbyMutha, MIKE and Na-Kel Smith; as well as featuring on "MTOMB" from Earl's EP Feet of Clay. On July 30, 2020, she released her debut album Couldn't Wait to Tell You... to critical acclaim, featuring guest appearances from C.S. Armstrong, Lord Byron and Akeema Zane. Exactly a year later on the album's first anniversary, she would follow this up with CWTTY+, a deluxe companion to the album with 6 brand new tracks. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Liv.e">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
