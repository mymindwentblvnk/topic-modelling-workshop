South Gate is an original four piece metal band that hails from Detroit, Mi. The band has, to date, written fourteen songs, three of which have been released on a self-recorded and produced EP called "Psychological Warfare".

The members of South Gate have over fifty years of combined musical experience, and have been involved in well known local acts such as Tread and Twist of Fate.

South Gate has caught the attention of legendary Detroit rock station, 101.1 WRIF and it's very popular program Midnight Metal (wrif.com/midnightmetal), getting regular airplay beginning 8-22-2004 up to the present. South Gate has opened for Genitorturers, WASP, Soil, Six Feet Under, Metal Church, Hatebreed, Black Label Society and most recently Anthrax. 

The band is considered "metal", but their music is not easily categorized. South Gate are currently seeking a major label deal, but have no problem in doing what it takes to "make it" with their own indie label Blood Brother Records if need be.
