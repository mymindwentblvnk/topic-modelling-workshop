There are more than one artist called Flashpoint.

1) FLASHPOINT formed in 1987 and is the solo outfit of former BITCHES SIN guitar player Ian Toomey, yet remains more than just a continuation of the legendary NWOBHM outfit. Although there are some ex members in the line-up of this band, the music of FLASHPOINT definitely has a more melodic approach than the bone hard heavy metal of BITCHES SIN. Ian and his brother Pete teamed up with Steve Turton on drums and Kev Graham on vocals and bass. Frank Quegan and Dave Rosingana joined the ranks for the recordings adding some backing vocals and keyboards to some of the songs of their debut album "No Point Of Reference". Thus a new post-NWOBHM band was born, who presented themselves to the world by means of this wonderful debut album. An album that didn't only show us the more melodic approach of the Toomey brothers, but it also proved that these guys still knew how to play some mean guitar riffs and solos.

Disappearing off the radar for many years following their debut, FLASHPOINT resurfaced in 2005 with "Lazer Love", a collection of previously unreleased tracks, and followed this with an album of brand new material issued simply as "Flashpoint" in 2006.

2) Flashpoint were a Hard Rock/Nu Metal band who released one album in 1999 called "On The Verge" through Sonic Unyon Distribution, as well as appearing on the second stage as part of the Ozzfest 1999 tour. The song "Militant" also appeared on the 'Extra Value' compilation album that came with purchased copies of Megadeth's "Risk" album.

3) Flashpoint was a swedish band that appeared on the "En knippe svensk punk" cassette. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Flashpoint">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
