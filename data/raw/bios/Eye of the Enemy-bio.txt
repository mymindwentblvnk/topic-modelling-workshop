Eye of the Enemy have been raising hell within the metal scene since 2006 with the release of their Demo and subsequent self-titled E.P in 2008.  

Catching the attention of the Welkin Entertainment booking agency and Just Say Rock Record Label Eye of the Enemy signed on to become part of both of their artist rosters and have been growing from strength to strength ever since. Playing show after show with unrelenting aggression and energy up there with the best that the Australian metal scene had to offer. 

In 2010, Eye of the Enemy released their first full length album Weight of Redemption. 

The album was received with much fanfare and critical acclaim being nominated for album of the year against metal heavyweights across the globe. With standout tracks such as “A Reason for Treason”, "Facade" “Peace” and “Burn the World appealing to metal fans and non-metal fans alike.  

In support of its release Eye of the Enemy played several notable shows and national tours with international bands such as: 
• Amon Amarth (2 national tours) 

• At the Gates 

• Cradle of Filth  

• Despised Icon 

• Malevolent Creation 

• Screamfest metal festival (Edguy, Ensifirum, Cynic, Dark Funeral, Destoryer 666 and several more) 

Not to mention making a big splash in the local metal scene having played the Sonic Forge Festival 3 years in a row and several other shows with across Australia playing alongside some of the biggest names in Australian metal of the past and present. 

In early 2014 Eye of the Enemy mark their return with the long awaited follow up album to Weight of Redemption, “The Vengeance Paradox.”  

The album tells a cautionary tale of how “Evil begets evil”. 

Track by track listeners are guided down the path of how ones delusions of grandeur and quest for vengeance have in fact turned them into the evil they vowed to destroy. 

The music blends devastatingly heavy and melodic seamlessly showcasing the strengths that make Eye of the Enemy one of the most exciting metal acts today. 

With an extensive touring schedule in the works starting with an Australian tour supporting Children of Bodom in May, Eye of the Enemy will be a band to look out for as they continue to take their music to the masses.
