1) Platypus was a progressive rock supergroup that consisted of members from Dream Theater (John Myung, Derek Sherinian), King's X (Ty Tabor) and Dixie Dregs (Rod Morgenstein).
The group was formed in 1997 and disbanded in 2000. There are two follow-up projects: The Jelly Jam, effecively Platypus minus Sherinian and Jughead featuring Derek Sherinian, Ty Tabor and Matt & Gregg Bisonnette.

2) Platypus was a little known, short-lived disco-funk band that was active in the late '70s and early '80s. Formed in Dayton, Ohio, in 1978, the band consisted of Arthur Stokes (lead vocals, percussion), Kerry Rutledge (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Lloyd Jones (bass), Curtis Sanford (drums, keyboards), and Larry "Irfaan" Hines (lead guitar). They combined their appreciation of the Ohio Players and Parliament/Funkadelic with a lot of disco gloss and sometimes added rock elements. But unlike the Players or Parliament/Funkadelic, Platypus didn't use any horns. In 1978, the five member band signed with Casablanca, which -- shortly after Hines' life was taken by leukemia -- released its self-titled debut LP the following year. Cherry, a second album, was issued in 1980. Neither album sold, and the outfit broke up. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Platypus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
