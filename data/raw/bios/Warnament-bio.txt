Warnament was formed in the beginning of 2007 in Tetovo, Macedonia, by Dejan Stanojevic and  Jovica Veljanovski. They shared the same interest in thrash metal, so they decided to form a band that would play their favorite musical genre. They acquired Caki as the lead vocalist. They started working on their own material, which quickly resulted in their first composition "War for your name". The band then played at MKC Festival in Skopje, with session members filling the empty drum and bass spots (Vlade and Stanoja respectively).

After the festival, the band experienced another member departure: Jovica Veljanovski, left the band because of his own personal reasons, which left Warnament only with 2 full-time members. At this point "Slow and painful death " was released as the band's second composition. The line-up quickly changed, when Boris Gjeroski - guitar, and Velibor Najdovski - drums, joined the band, change that led to more serious work on their first demo cd. The demo was titled "Executional Order" and was self-released on September 1st. Then Stanoja] joined the band as a bass player, which established the current band line-up.

In 2009 Warnament release an split-album with the band Chaos Creation, called "Arrows Of Agony".

Currently the band is promoting their new material written for their future still unnamed album via concerts throughout Macedonia. Album coming soon!
