Psychedelic/Doom/Stoner Metal/Noise/Drone band from Columbus, Ohio. Traitors Return to Earth formed in July of 2010 for one reason and one reason only, that is to play the heaviest music possible at the most unreasonable volumes. The band is influenced heavily by Sleep, Electric Wizard, High on Fire, YOB, Sons of Otis, Weedeater and many more. In August of 2011 they released their EP titled “Smoke screen”. The EP was recorded, mixed and mastered by Brian Samakis in March and April of 2011. Since the completion of the EP Scott Simmons has decided to depart from the band to peruse other interests.
