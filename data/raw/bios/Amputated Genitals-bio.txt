Amputated Genitals is a brutal death band created in 2003 by ex-members of Purulent. Daniel Paz, Sebastian Guarin, & Beto Drunks Martinez have reemerged with the same rapid, extreme, brutal, sick death grind. After two long years these musicians have prepared the recording of their first CD under the new title. The new CD, Human Meat Gluttony, produced by Gore and Blood Productions in August 2005 is a collaboration in which the artists express themselves by unleashing their lived experience during the past few years. Guitarist, Leviathan of the band Carnal from Armenia, Colombia has joined the band to complete the alignment. With their band finally completed, Amputated Genitals is currently in the process of exposing their music to their fans and promoting their album.
