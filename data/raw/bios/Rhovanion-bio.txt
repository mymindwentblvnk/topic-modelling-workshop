Celtic Folk Rock/Metal from The Netherlands.

In the early 2010 two friends came up with the idea to start a band together. They found among other friends musicians who wanted the same. They wanted to make a mix between Celtic folk music, Heavy metal and Rock. Then in march of that same year they came together for the first time to make music and soon after that they preformed for the first time on stage. Now, a few years later, they have proudly released their first EP, called The Land of the Wild. And they are determined to go on and spread their music into the world.
