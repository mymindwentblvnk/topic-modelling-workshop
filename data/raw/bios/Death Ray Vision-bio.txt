Current members of Killswitch Engage and Shadows Fall and ex members of Overcast and Cannae have combined forces in the new project DEATH RAY VISION. These veterans of the Boston metal scene play a raw brand of metallic hardcore that recaptures the energy of their old school hardcore roots infused with all they have learned and experienced as musicians over the past decade. The songs are short blasts of energy and intensity built on thrash metal rhythms and chugging guitar riffs. DEATH RAY VISION recalls the insanity of the old hardcore days while remaining focused on destroying the future. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Death+Ray+Vision">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
