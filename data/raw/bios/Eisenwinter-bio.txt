Early Black Metal from Switzerland. Formed in 1993 in Basel, Switzerland by the Band's  only member, Zwingherr Greif.

First releases featured common Black Metal lyrics, but from the 1999 Demo "Reichswinter" onward, ariosophy as well as other nationalist/racialist topics were included as well. This was later dropped almost completely with the first full album "verkommen, entartet & verreckt"

With recent releases, EISENWINTER develeoped into one of the very few (or probably the only) (NS)BM-Band(s) to incorporate humor and fun themes in their music, unmasking the genre's limitations and tendency for embarrassing behaviour. The Album "Monumentales Scheitern" 
(engl. Epic Fail)  released in 2010, features a cover Version of Shane MacGowan's "call me Paddy Rolling Stone" with alternative lyrics "call me NS Black Metal".

The latest Album was released in 2012 bearing the title "Armee der arischen Untoten" (Army of the Aryan Undead)

Today, Z.H. Greif describes Eisenwinter's Music as "Dictatorial Owl Metal", the BM-pidgin-word "dictatorial" being a tribute to an old french band.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Eisenwinter">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
