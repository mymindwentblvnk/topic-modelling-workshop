Curved Air is a pioneering British progressive rock group formed in 1970 by musicians from mixed artistic backgrounds, including classical, folk, and electronic sound. Primarily active in the 1970s, and with occasional hiatuses, the band reformed in 2008.

The band was, for a time in the 1970s, a sensation in the world of British progressive-rock because of Sonja Kristina's sensual vocals and Darryl Way's romantic violin. Kristina was a veteran of the London musical Hair in the late 60s.  This combination of sensual vocals and romantic violin was the same as tested in California by It's a Beautiful Day. Francis Monkman (the real genius behind their compositions) added a synthesiser. 

Their debut album Air Conditioning (1970) contains "Vivaldi", their most celebrated piece. Second Album (1971) delivered their only hit, "Back Street Luv", and the twelve-minute "Piece of Mind". Their artistic peak was reached with  Phantasmagoria (1972), but the band dissolved after Air Cut (1973), with Eddie Jobson taking over violin and keyboard duties. Kristina was joined by her husband Stewart Copeland (future The Police) for a new version of Curved Air that released Midnight Wire 1975) and Airborne (1976). 

From then on Curved Air as a group were largely inactive. In early 2008, the band regrouped. A live album consisting of recordings from the previous UK tour, Live Atmosphere, was released on 2 April 2012. A studio album, North Star, followed in 2014. 

Sonja Kristina remains the only original band member. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Curved+Air">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
