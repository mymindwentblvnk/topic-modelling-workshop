Hello, we are a group called Broken Drum and we like to write soulful drum and bass. Our influences stem from a wide degree of music but at the moment it's 80's and 70's soul, most hiphop, most dnb, some guitar based music, and general electronic weirdness. We are always up for collaborations so anyone who wishes to get involved please contact me on the details below. 
euanmackinnon@live.co.uk or aim 'Brokendrum UK' for any info. 

Would also like to say big up to all the DJ's supporting our music, respect  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/BrokenDrum">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
