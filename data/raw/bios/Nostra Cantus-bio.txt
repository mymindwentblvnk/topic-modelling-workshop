Nostra Cantus ia a project founded by John Elvis in 2012 on Brazil with a very experimental metal stuff, wich would be redirected to Death/ Black/ doom metal with time, and with time would be added a atmospheric mixed with melodic metal. With the release of No More Sanity the project parted ways with his other face, creating another project called Clamantes Mortem. No More sanity was a very atmospheric and experimental metal release. Followed by a heavy record called Diabolus Benedictus wich defines how heavy and raw the project could be. And the in 2015 the project released the Atrophied Eyes from mercy, the album that defines most of the characteristics of the project. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nostra+Cantus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
