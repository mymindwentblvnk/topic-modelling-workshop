Alden Tyrell is a leading contemporary nu-skool disco artist reinventing old disco and electro-funk sounds. He has produced several releases through the Dutch label Clone.

His name is coincidentally very similar to the name of the character Dr. Eldon Tyrell in the 1980's science-fiction movie Blade Runner.
