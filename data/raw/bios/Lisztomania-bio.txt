Lisztomania is a 1975 progressive rock soundtrack album by Rick Wakeman to the movie of the same name.

It is the soundtrack to the 1975 film Lisztomania by Ken Russell of a biography of Franz Liszt.
Some tracks feature Roger Daltrey. The album was later upgraded as The Real Lisztomania by Wakeman because he was dissatisfied with the original release. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lisztomania">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
