Formed from the ashes of POISON (Ger) by the guitarist of that band,  Uli "Angel of Death" Hildenbrand. Released a handful of demos and 7 inches between 1990 and 1999, the earlier of which sounding very much akin to POISON (several POISON songs were re-recorded by R.U. Dead? albeit under different titles and with different lyrics), while the later material shows noticeable deviation from the straight-ahead blackened death/thrash style in favor of a more "progressive" brand of death/thrash. Split up in 1999. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/R.U.+Dead%3F">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
