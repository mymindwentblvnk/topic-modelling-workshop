EXIST M is a 4-piece metal unit, a small band with the big sound. A remarkable member of Minsk metal scene. Music’s above all. EXIST M’s unique sound explores the space of more than two decades of heavy music, combining the raw guitar sounds of groove metal with modern metalcore constructions, the speedy riffs of thrash metal with the soul of a real hardcore. Add the atmospheric synth sou
nds to the mix, and you’ll get what EXIST M is all about. The band’s extraordinary stage presence is another trademark. EXIST M’s reputation of an uncompromising live performer is well deserved. Approved by the metal audience of Belarus, Ukraine and Poland, EXIST M is a welcomed guest at the stages of different music festivals, including the international. The band has gained a number of music awards and nominations, “Best Metal Voice” and “Best Newcomer” among them.
Don’t forget the frontwoman – a fragile girl Nastya. Probably the nicest person you’ve ever met, but the stage devil with brutal and full of energy live appearance. And she’s got it all…
As for now, the Belarusian metal music phenomenon is ready to go worldwide with the first full-length album, released in December 2012.
