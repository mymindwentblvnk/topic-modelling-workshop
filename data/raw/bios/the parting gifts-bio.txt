What began as a one-off split 45 by songwriters Greg Cartwright (The Oblivians, Compulsive Gamblers, Reigning Sound) and Coco Hames (the Ettes, Coco Motion) quickly evolved into The Parting Gifts. "I thought, I'd write a song, Greg would write a song, we'd record them together, and that would be that," says Hames. "Luckily, Greg's prolific awesome switch was on, and we got this whole record instead." Offers Cartwright, "I was just so impressed with how easily things went that I was inspired to write more material for the project." And so we have their debut full-length on In The Red. As if the talents of Cartwright and Hames aren't enough, the album features intense performances from Dan Auerbach (the Black Keys, BlacRok), Patrick Keeler (The Greenhornes, The Raconteurs), Jem Cohen and Poni Silver (the Ettes) and Dave Amels (Reigning Sound, Daptones). The result is an impressive fourteen original songs penned by Cartwright and Hames, as well as a haunting cover of the Rolling Stones' "(Walkin' Through the) Sleepy City." Catch the Parting Gifts at Goner Fest 7 this year in Memphis, TN, just in time for their Strychnine Dandelion to make its way into your record collection. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Parting+Gifts">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
