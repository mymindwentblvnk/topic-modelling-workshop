Dj Sprinkles aka Terre Thaemlitz is an award winning multi-media producer, writer, public speaker, educator, audio remixer, DJ and owner of the Comatonse Recordings record label. Her work critically combines themes of identity politics - including gender, sexuality, class, linguistics, ethnicity and race - with an ongoing critique of the socio-economics of commercial media production. This diversity of themes is matched by Thaemlitz’ wide range of production styles, which include electroacoustic computer music, club oriented deep house, digital jazz, ambient, and computer composed neo-expressionist piano solos. Accordingly, her audio projects have found release on an eclectic variety of record labels ranging from the Deleuze-influenced label Mille Plateaux, to Yellow Magic Orchestra founder Haruomi Hosono’s Daisyworld Discs, to Bill Laswell’s Subharmonic Records, to Universal Music Germany’s Classical Division, to the UK dance label Disorient, and so on. Graphic design, photography, illustration, text and video also play an important part in Thaemlitz’ projects. Her writings on music and culture have been published internationally in a number of books, academic journals and magazines. As a speaker and educator on issues of non-essentialist transgender identity and pansexual Queer sexuality, Thaemlitz has participated in panel discussions throughout Europe and Japan, as well as held numerous cross-cultural sensitivity workshops at Tokyo’s Uplink Factory, near her current residence in Kawasaki, Japan. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/DJ+Sprinkles">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
