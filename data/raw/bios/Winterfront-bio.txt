Winterfront started as project of two fiends Terrt nd Sorr in late autumn of 2010, but some songs were created years before (Molitva svarogu, Frozen throne). Before winter arrived demo tape "Thrones of eternal winter" was finished.
In late winter and spring of 2011 we recorded EP "Of iron and blood" with more aggressive sound, and latter in summer single "Beyond the grave of the enemy".
In that period Peršić joined on drums, and Granić on bass. Granić was replaced with Frostkald in autumn of 2011, and Peršić moved to guitar from drums.
For the first gig that was in Pogon Jedinstvo Zagreb on 25.2.2012 Jerko Vičić played drums as session member. Latter that year Hell joined on drums, and Peršić left the band soon. Band continued with four members, and played gig in klub Rupa in split on 26.5.2012. In summer of 2012 we recorded LP "Northwinds" with all old songs, and one new. On 14.9.2012 Band performed on "Night of the howling wolves" in Klub Željezničar in Zagreb. In October of 2012 Mutillator joins Winterfront on bass and Frostkald moved to Guitar. Sadly after recording an LP all material was lost, but that was even better because we re-recorded it in better quality. In March 2013 Frostkald left the band. And just one small fact, every time when we are performing live the rain is falling.......
