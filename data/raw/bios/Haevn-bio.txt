HAEVN is a collaboration between producer/songwriter Marijn van der Meer and movie score composer/producer Jorrit Kleijnen, based in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Their unique combination of cinematic melodies together with warm vocals has led to the haunting song ‘Where the heart is’. Their first release soon attracted the attention of Volvo as the car brand used the song for one of their commercials. After the release of the commercial, the song began to climb the Shazam charts in different countries in Europe. 

Soon after the release of the Volvo commercial another car brand wanted to use one of their songs. The song ‘Finding out more’ was used in a commercial for BMW. A head start for a young band. For the recording of the two full tracks they approached producer Tim Bran (London Grammar, Rhodes, Seafret). He invited them to record the tracks in London. 

HAEVN is currently working on their debut EP including the songs ‘Where the heart is’ and ‘Finding out more’.
