SubArachnoid Space was a psychedelic rock band founded in San Francisco, California, United States in 1996. The band since relocated to Portland, Oregon.
The last line-up included: Melynda Jackson (guitar), Danial Barone (bass), Danial Ozborne (guitar) and Chuck Watkins (drums).

The term "sub-arachnoid space" is a medical term that refers to a region in the brain. The name was chosen because it looked and sounded intriguing--not for any clinical medical reason. 

The line up of the group changed over time but the approach, which one former member termed, "drone", never changed. The music had something in common with the "drone" of East Indian music (which refers to the chordal structure), so perhaps that is what was meant, as the music is inventive, creative, and ever-changing--certainly not droning, as is sometimes used to describe boring personalities, sounds, and conversations.

The band disbanded following their 2009 release "Eight Bells" hinting at the possibility of new constellations to emerge in the foreseeable future. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/SubArachnoid+Space">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
