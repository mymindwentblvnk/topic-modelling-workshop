Hubass replaced Klempicz on bass and kloozkha was introduced as a new frontman in 2006. "No Repent" is a four-piece EP recorded with the new vocalist and includes four songs "No Repent", "Hypnotized '06", Speak My Mind '06 and Podatek od Å¼ycia. The band supported Artrosis on the Con Trust Tour Poland 2006 and is ready to shake the pack a bit with the new stuff. Lebenssteuer offers a hihgly energetic, reckless and powerful splash of rammstein-like beats with even more rock'n'roll attidute, where a wide metal tradition melts with all the red hot energy and the joy of living and creating. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lebenssteuer">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
