Faithless Priest is a black metal band from Harrisonburg, VA. They formed in 2009 from the remnants of The Whimsical World Of. In 2010 they released their first album, Visions of an Altar, as an online only release until they could raise money for a CD release. They are currently working on hammering out a live set.
