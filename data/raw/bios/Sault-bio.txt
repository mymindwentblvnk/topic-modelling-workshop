Sault are an anonymous British music collective that make a mixture of rhythm and blues, house and disco. Despite critical acclaim, they eschew interaction with the media. They frequently foreground black-centric issues.

Their first four albums credit Inflo as producer; winner of Ivor Novello awards for his work on Little Simz' Grey Area and as co-writer of Michael Kiwanuka's "Black Man in a White World". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sault">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
