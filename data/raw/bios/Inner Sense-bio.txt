Manchester based Inner Sense were one of the first samba influenced bands in Britain. They were founded by Colin Seddon who had seen the London School of Samba perform at the WOMDAD festival and was inspired to invite some musician friends to set up the Inner Sense Percussion Workshops - later simply Inner Sense. The group played and toured extensively between 1985 and 2000. Although they did not achieve mainstream commercial success, tens of thousands of people from islands in the North of Scotland to Cornwall and beyond were inspired by their performances, which were often accompanied by workshops. They released a single CD entitled "Devotion" in 1997.

The second one "Inner Sense" is a project from Russia, its leader Sergei Ivantsov experienced in different genres came to some kind of gothic pop art. The history goes back for about 10 years. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Inner+Sense">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
