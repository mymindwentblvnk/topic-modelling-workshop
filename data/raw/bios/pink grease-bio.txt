Sheffield Sleazesters Pink Grease keep it electro-snitzy, rockabilly glitzy. Multi-coloured and multi-instrumental, the band slay down audiences with their sonic boom home-made synth machines, sax and speed riddled vocals. This is the nasty show!

Pink Grease are a six-piece rock group from Sheffield, UK, formed in 2001. The members consist of: Rory Lewarne  (lead vocals), Steven Santa Cruz (guitar, vocals), Nick Collier (machine), John Joseph Lynch (guitar, saxophone), Marc Hoade (drums), and Daniel Pencavel (bass) (taking over from Stuart Faulkner who left in 2005).

They released their debut EP All Over You in May 2003, followed in June 2004 by a full length album This Is For Real which was released to some acclaim. The release of the next album Mechanical Heart, which was due to be their second one for Mute Records, has been postponed as they are no longer with the label. However, a limited number of promo copies are available direct from the band from the Pink Grease MySpace page. Alternatively they are available from the Sheffield Vision website in conjunction with the purchase of "The World Of Pink Grease" DVD, which includes documentaries, footage of the new album being made, and live performance/videos from the songs.
