Sipprell is an artist who works on feeling, emotion.
Hailing from South London, the singer blends a soulful touch with an awareness of underground electronic music.
Hooking up with a series of producers, Sipprell has been searching for that beat, for the right essence to compliment her songwriting.
It seems that she's found it. Debut single 'Curious' is out and it features some deft, down tempo production from Ragz Originale.
Think Andreya Triana's collaborations with Flying Lotus or Bonobo and you'd be close: this is dank yet wonderfully engrossing electronic soul. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/SIPPRELL">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
