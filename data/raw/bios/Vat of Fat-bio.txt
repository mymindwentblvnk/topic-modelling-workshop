Hailing from Nottingham, England, Vat of Fat were a 2 piece doom band, formed in 2004, rent asunder but a scant year hence. The one physical release was a split 12" with Lancastrians As The Tide Consumes, called The Grimm Truth.

There exists also a rehearsal cdr called Zombie Hitler, and a recording of a gig with Cephalic Carnage at the Old Angel.
