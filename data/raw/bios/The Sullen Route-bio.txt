The debut album of young Russian band from Volgograd continues traditions of death/doom metal and represents the band as talented professional musicians. String material created without keyboards and other trend features will suit the tastes of fans of uncompromising death/doom in the vein of Mourning Beloveth, Process Of Guilt and Ataraxie.

After the first album issued in 2010 by Solitude prod., a number of gigs in support of the debut album, changes in line-up, and, finally, release of Internet-EP “Pulse” the band Sullen Route from Volgograd is ready to present the other side of their music to the audience. «Apocalyclinic» demonstrates evolution from orthodox doom death metal to the area which cannot be definitely classified: in the new work of musicians one can find influence of dark metal combined with features of post metal and progressive metal, extreme vocals, and powerful and solid sound. The essential advance in music is manifested by refined structure of compositions and brilliant mastering.
