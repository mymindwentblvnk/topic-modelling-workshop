Bergen Industrial Black Metal act Black Hole Generator was initiated as a solo concept by VULTURE INDUSTRIES frontman Bjørnar Erevik Nilsen during 2006. Shortly afterward the project expanded, introducing guitarist Dreggen of AETERNUS, CULT OF CATHARSIS and DEATHCON to record debut EP 'Black Karma' for release through US label Ars Magna Recordings. Recording at Conclave and Earshot studios the band co-produced alongside Herbrand Larsen. Ares from AETERNUS aided on vocals and classical guitar.

Subsequently a live-line-up was assembled, including second guitarist Øyvind Madsen of VULTURE INDUSTRIES and SULPHUR plus DEATHCON, AMOK, HELHEIM, CULT OF CATHARSIS, DEAD TO THIS WORLD and TAAKE drummer Mord (a.k.a. Tormod Haraldson). Dreggen also hooked up with GRIMFIST in August. 'Black Karma' saw release in December. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Black+Hole+Generator">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
