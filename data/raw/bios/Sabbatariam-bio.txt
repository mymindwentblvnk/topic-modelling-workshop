They released a demo in 2002 and then a split album with the black metal band Demoniciduth called "The Valley of the Shadow" in 2004.  In 2007 Sabbatariam released the EP "From Dust to Dust," a tribute/cover album.  Two of the members of Sabatariam, Isaque Soares and Daniel Corpse, went on to help form the death metal band Krig.
