Started in february 2005 The project by producers Massi Arena and Fabio Liuzzi is based on a solid research for new sounds. Cyberpunkers produce their first single, Sex Machine, with Excess Music. In 2005 Sex Machine was supported by Pete Tong, Eric Prydz, Carl Cox, Eric Morillo, Steve Angello, Sebastian Ingrosso... "Cyberpunkers" release their second single that was considered to be one of the best “Electronica Records” ever made. Cyberpunkers sign for Sandrino Beesley’s Mcgroove Records deciding to make it their own label. They soon remix "Egostereo - Sudoku" one of the most popular and played hits of the 2006 Miami Winter Music Conference. After a big success in Mykonos in the summer of the same year, they go back to the studio creating “Breathless” released with outstanding remix by Superchumbo Aka Tom Stephan on b side on Mcgroove Records. In 2007 Cyberpunkers remix other four important tracks: “D.Ramirez – La Discotek” (Underwater Records), “Tiny Stikz & Anton Fielding - Fevers Coming” (Chumbo Mundo Records), “Egostereo vs Aldrin – Singapore” (Mcgroove Records) and “Massi Arena – Magic Carpet” (Rise Records). With an eclectic and thrilling dj set, hiding their id's behind unique masks, and plyng together with two separate sets, Cyberpunkers have created their own music style, a philosophy of life aiming for a continuous research for avant-garde vibes.
