Jon Porras is an ambient/drone musician. He is a member of Barn Owl and records as Elm. 

His first solo album, "Undercurrent", released in 2011, is set to the tidal rhythms of the Pacific and tuned into the metabolic pathways of the northwest coast. Porras scripts a love poem to the mist, a prayer cast in ghostly reflected guitar and deep pools of distortion. The ominous opening of 'Gray Dunes' is a dense and impenetrable murk, a fear that eventually succumbs to distortion but then gives way to a endless open space of delay in its second half. Its trajectory is symbolic of the record as a whole, with many of the darker paths on 'Undercurrent' leading to lush other worlds of delicate beauty, fragile guitar notes that emerge from the sea for a moment or two then fade back into the whole. 'Calm' and 'Lands End' are lovely spots of respite, clear beams of moonlight breaking through the clouds, a shot of light that ushers in the lone funerary come down of closer 'Gaze'. 

Subsequently, he has released a series of albums under his own name.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jon+Porras">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
