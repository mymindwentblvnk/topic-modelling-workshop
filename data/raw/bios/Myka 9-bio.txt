Originally known as Microphone Mike, Myka 9 is recognized as one of the most stylistically advanced rappers in the 90’s. His first real break was in 1991 when he received the opportunity to be a lyrical ghost writer on N.W.A’s first compilation, titled N.W.A and the Posse. He then had the opportunity to collaborate with major acts such as The Wailers, Carmen Carter, The Last Poets, and co‐founded the legendary hip‐hop group, Freestyle Fellowship. Today, Myka champions his often imitated, never‐duplicated lyrical style around the world. He is known for his rapidfire, jazz‐influenced, melodic rapping and often incorporates singing and occasional scatting into his songs. Myka has said of his style, “My rhymes take the direction of a jazz trumpet or sax solo, like Miles or Trane, if I was to rhyme in the same meter as those notes . . . that’s my concept.” <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Myka+9">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
