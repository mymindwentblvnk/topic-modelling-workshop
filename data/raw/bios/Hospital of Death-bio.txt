Hospital of Death are an '80s styled old school thrash metal band from sleepy Cheshire, UK. Formed 1994 in the midst of the underground tape trading scene, the band was formed to play a one off secondary school gig and quickly disbanded after their graduation. Having reformed at a band renunion party in late 2006, H.O.D. (a schoolyard nod to NYC's Stormtroopers of Death) formed to share their love for the scene that crafted their lives from that gig onwards.

The mission of H.O.D. is to create a 50/50 mix of NWOBHM & Old School Thrash Metal that induces the listener to drink and party heavily. Their music is created, promoted & distributed freely with no constraints or budget & promotion is currently solely based on word of mouth and online (replacing tape) trading with other like minded listeners & artists who have a 'passion for the thrashin''.
