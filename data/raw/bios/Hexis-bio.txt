2) Hexis is an industrial / EBM music project from Perú.

1) Hexis is a rowdy and destructive DIY hardcore extravaganza from Copenhagen, Denmark. These guys play a super heavy style of distorted, beefed up black metal infused with sludge. Powerful blasts of furious guitar riffs, thundering drums and doomy bass all topped off with girthy growls and screams. They recently dropped a long awaited full length that's mesmerizing and punishing in all means. They are one of the earliest Celeste influenced blackened hardcore/sludge metal bands.

2) Hexis is a solo project started in Lima, Perú. It spread on the internet around 2005 with tracks like voces and aún no es tarde. Around 2008 worked with deamon k - fleischgeil.ch dj - on a remix exchange and after that remixed the track angel. In the last years, Hexis has made remixes for k_l4, say just words and unsinn. As a solo band, Hexis does the programming, editing, mixing, designing, partying, drinking - everything. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hexis">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
