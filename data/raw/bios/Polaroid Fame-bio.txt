Transcending the ubiquitous surf, sun and sand images and references that typify the Byron Bay music scene are the exciting group Polaroid Fame. A four piece from this beachside utopia, Polaroid Fame manage to combine the Byron vibe and its earthy charms and channel it through layers of guitars awash with melodic bass and 80’s reminiscent synths. They have been providing locals with this uniquely crafted sound to develop a strong following both here and around the country. Thanks to their constant touring of the east coast, as well as their electrifying set at this year’s Splendour In The Grass festival they are fast becoming one of the areas most accomplished live acts. Their Splendour performance was the perfect pre-cursor to the band's upcoming and eagerly anticipated debut album release. Aptly titled ‘We Live Your Life’, it’s an affirmation that reinforces the fact that this group is just like you and I, sharing the same challenges, joys and human experiences. Utilising the world-class facilities at Studio 301, the group not only recorded their long player in Byron Bay, but also enlisted the production talents of locally based ARIA nominated producer/engineer Anthony Lycenko. This approach of working close to home allowed the group the precious time needed to work up the arrangements and overall direction that the production would take- ultimately resulting in an album that is brimming with great vocal hooks, catchy bass-lines and danceable grooves textured by spacious twin guitar interplay. Their tip-of-the-hat to 80’s rock will strike a chord with fans of Bowie, U2 and The Police as these are clear and valued influences on their distinctive, creative and exciting sound.
