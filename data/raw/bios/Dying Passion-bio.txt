The band is defined by Zuzana's stunning vocals, beautiful melodies, urgent guitars fused with poignant keyboard parts to form a mixture of doom metal melancholy, 70's psychedelia and modern alternative rock energy. All these you can find in music of DYING PASSION.
They begun as death/doom act and then have gone through many line-up changes, finally shifting their sound to more progressive realms.
