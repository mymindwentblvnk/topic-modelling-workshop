Trut is a project from Switzerland which was officially founded on the 06/06/06.
Since then they produced their first demo Traumwerdung.

The goal of this mostly black metal inspirated group is expressing misanthropy feelings and bringing their (own) mind into music.
The product is, as already mentioned, their cd Traumwerdung. But they play also improvisations, which never will be released on a cd.
(The Improvisation albums aren't real albums,
they just exist in this formation on last.fm)
