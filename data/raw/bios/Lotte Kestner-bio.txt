Lotte Kestner is the solo project of Anna-Lynne Williams of Trespassers William.

China Mountain (named after a mountain range in southern Oregon) was recorded over a year in her basement bedroom, and mixed in a Seattle studio with Trespassers bandmate Matt Brown. Most of the songs are built around acoustic guitar and several tracks of voice, and a bit of harmonica, keys, drums, ukulele, and harp. She was assisted on a few songs by friends - including Jeff Martin of Idaho on two of the album's tracks. China Mountain is available to buy now at www.saintlouprecords.com

Anna-Lynne's latest album is called Stolen. On here are coversongs of Damien Jurado, Vic Chesnutt , The Cure and many others.  Apart from Stolen are two Ep's with even more beautiful coversongs. 

Her most recent collaboration is with Robert Gomez and is called Ormonde.
