Formed in 2004, the band's breakthrough debut Robbers & Cowards was released to considerable acclaim in 2006. The darker Loyalty To Loyalty followed two years later, and 2011's Mine Is Yours introduced deeper anthemic qualities to the eclectic group's catalog. 

Dear Miss Lonelyhearts, which features the rollicking, energetic single "Miracle Mile," is Cold War Kids' first release with former Modest Mouse and Murder City Devils guitarist Dann Gallucci, who also handled its production alongside Lars Stalfors. 

"We were shaken up, ready to let certain songs go further than before by trying new styles and arrangements, while keeping others sparse and caring more about the finished product and less about how we got there," explains frontman Nathan Willet about the ten-track album, which was recorded at the band's private studio in San Pedro, CA. 

Cold War Kids are from Los Angeles, CA. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cold+War+Kids">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
