There is more than one band with the name Sand, at least ten:

1.)The krautrock band from lower Saxony, Germany, that released one album, Golem, in 1972. The album was produced by famed German producer/musician Klaus Schulze, and is known for its heavily psychedelic, synthesizer-based sound, although it does have many moments of somber acoustic melodies.

2.) A Japanese metalcore band. They released a couple of split-cd´s in Japan. They released an album in 2008 called Nuthin but a bitter mouth and have just recently released a CD called Spit on Authority in 2013
