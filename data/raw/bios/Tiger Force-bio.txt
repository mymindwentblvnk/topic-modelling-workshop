Don't press play before checking your volume levels,
Tiger Force are likely to blow out your windows.

Carried through incomprehensibly hip label Marquis
Cha Cha 'A Wasp In The Jar' punches from the first
blast of their eponymous 'Anthem'. They do not
relent from this point forwards: eight tracks
collide in your ears with shockwaves of fuzzy jolted
indie and screwed up art rock. Zapping synths and
snappy shared vocals give clap-happy 'Beat This' the
kind of sound which would result from a fight
between The Sugarcubes and Lush, with something of
1992 era Rough Trade in 'Five Six I Got Sticks'.

Undeniably of its time รป you can reference The
Gossip throughout รป nevertheless the bouncing
shouted choruses of 'Hey Yo Square Eyes' and melodic
crunch of 'Super Lo Fi Stutter Happy Panic Song'
have a frank freshness which should have you buzzing
without much resistance. As a comedown closing track
'Your Music Sucks' is Lily Allen style cutesy indie
which could well be a contender for best rhyming
couplet of the year: "I had so many plans but I
cheated in my exams."
