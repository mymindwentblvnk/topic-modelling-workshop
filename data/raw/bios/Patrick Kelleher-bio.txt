Dublin-based Patrick Kelleher is a  musician hailing from Glendalough in Co. Wicklow, Ireland, although he spent much of his childhood in the English town of Rugby, hometown of Spacemen 3. Patrick has released the album "You Look Cold",  the EP of the same name and the virtual 7", "He Has To Sleep Some Time". The latter can be downloaded free via his myspace. March 2010 will see the release of the remix album "You Look Colder", featuring remixes by Skinny Wolves, Thread Pulls, Catscars, Toymonger, Hunter-Gatherer, David Kitt, Jape, Fucktotem, Hulk, The Booklovers, Legion Of Two, School Tour and Katie Kim.

His music varies from brooding, tense electronica to jaunty acoustica to 8-bit dance-floor ditties, but always with a twist of something ethereal or idiosyncratic.  His songs are often premised on a mixture of live instrumentation, drum machines, cheapo voice-sampling yamaha keyboards and vocals that are, at times, heavily distorted.  Some (perhaps lazy) comparisons could be made with six-foot hairy male Si Schroeder, Montr√©al-based floozy Owen Pallett/Final Fantasy, with distinct echoes of the beautiful and barking Kate Bush.

Kelleher has been championed by BBC Radio 6's Stuart Maconie and Phantom FM's Pearl and has supported Chequerboard, God Is An Astronaut and Thread Pulls with his backing-band, whose name changes from show to show.  Names include The Wet Dreams,The Sick Fucks and His Cold Dead Hands.  He is also a band-member of the pop-drone ensemble Children Under Hoof.
