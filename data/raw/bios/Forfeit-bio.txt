There are 2 bands with the name Forfeit: 1) Forfeit is a band birthed by the inspiration that its members drew from the legacy of their local scene. Having all been in previous hardcore outfits, Steve Hornyak, Ben Shaw, and TomDom felt a strong pull towards the roots of Syracuse hardcore.

In 2007 the group started writing and playing songs in that vein together as Forfeit. That same year they recorded a demo at More Sound Studio. The following year brought the addition of both Brian McGee and Pat Benson to fill out the lineup and the sonic void. In 2008, Forfeit released their first EP, "Visions" on Reaper Records. Touring to support the release with bands such as Trapped Under Ice, Death Before Dishonor, Terror, Blacklisted, Cro-Mags, Have Heart and Down to Nothing. Bringing the music to new fans of the band as much as they can and developing a great following in a short time.

2009 brings a new LP recording from the group that is being released this fall on Reaper Records. The album is entitled "The Lower Depths" and promises to build and expand on their musical vision. The group plans to tour extensively to support the release and bring both pride and glory to the scene that spawned them.

In May 2010 Forfeit decided to call it quits and will play a final show on June 27th in Syracuse NY. RIP.
