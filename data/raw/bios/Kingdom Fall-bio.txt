Kingdom Fall is a band formed by the gods in the bowels of an intensely awesome Iced Earth concert on October 23, 2008. The core three members still remain Mat Worstell, Mike Rubalcaba, and Eric Smith. This band combines traditional heavy metal rhythms, power-house drumming, bass lines that decimate the foundations of civilized society, and a voice so powerful Thor himself would quiver in his mighty boots. 

Starting with a two song demo that contained the tracks Domain, and Eternal Dream(both make me dickwet) the band progressed even further in their songwriting with powerful tracks like The Last Symphony, and The Forgotten. This band hails from the Modesto area of California and will undoubtedly dominate the metal scene in the future. Unless of course the metal industry continues to suck.
