Ancient at Birth combins the speed and heaviness of modern thrash such as The Haunted and Nevermore, the technical intricacies of brutal death metal such as Necrophagist, and harmonic techniques of classical composers all the way from the Baroque to the 20th century periods for a sound that is melodic, brutal, and fresh.

In June of 2008, Ancient at Birth announced that they were breaking up, with several of the band members forming the band Acridious. However this would not stay permanent and Ancient at Birth reformed in April of 2009 with a new lineup.
