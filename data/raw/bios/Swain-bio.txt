The band formerly known as This Routine Is Hell.

Call it restlessness, call it fear, call it being out of step or call it being stubborn; This Routine is Hell has been the medium through which these, what some would call “defects” have been ruthlessly transformed into an uncompromising “NO”. 

Existing somewhere between today’s obsolete definitions of hardcore and punk, it’s hard to tell exactly what we are; but more important to us is why we’re here. Where self-doubt has laid us to rest, creativity must awaken us. Where sadness only saddens more, the power of will and love must empower us.
