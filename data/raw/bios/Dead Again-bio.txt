There was a previous band called Dead Again as well:

Dead Again come from the suburbs of Philidelphia, Pennslyvania, and play a brand of technical metalcore full of tempo changes and huge breakdowns. The band released their first EP, Bring The Bedroom Mosh, in 2004 on the now defunct Zero Velocity Records and garnered an underground following through word of mouth and a solid touring schedule. This eventually led to their signing to Emerald Moon records and preparation for their first full length, Monolith, to be released in late 2006. With the new album bringing a heavier, more immediately enjoyable sound both in the vocals and guitars.
