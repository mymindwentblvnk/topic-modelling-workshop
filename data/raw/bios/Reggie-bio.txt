Reginald Helms Jr. P.K.A reggie was born and raised in Houston Texas, but it wouldn’t be a stretch to say he was born and raised in the church as well. Deeply rooted in his upbringing he cites the church as one of his first inspirations to start writing music. Making music as a way to express himself was allowed in reggie’s household but his life choices weren’t. After several incidents of reggie getting kicked out for choices he made, he decided to stay where he was sent. As a result reggie was forced to live 1000 different lives in order to survive, which ultimately distracted him from his music. All those distractions ended up being turned into songs and shaped reggie into the artist we now know today. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Reggie">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
