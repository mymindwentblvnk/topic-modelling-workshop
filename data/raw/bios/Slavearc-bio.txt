Slavearc were formed by ex-members of Withdrawn in mid-1997, inspired by animal and earth liberation ideals, and pushing a militant vegan and drug-free ideology. Controversial within the UK Hardcore scene for their polarizing stance, they split up in 1999.

   Members moved on to such bands as Koreisch, Kevorkian Solution, Stockton Foster, Unborn, Cracked Cop Skulls, Touchdown, xCanaanx, and Kurohata. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Slavearc">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
