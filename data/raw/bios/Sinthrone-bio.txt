Sinthrone was founded in 1998 by Ilkka (guitar,vocals), Mika (bass) Juha (drums) and Kalle (vocals). In the beginning the band played (or at least wanted to play) some sort of deathmetal. After Kalle left the band in early 1999 bands musical style changed more into guitar-rock, and band name settled to be Capture. First demo "Shadows" was released in 1999, followed by "Cast Your Love" in 2000.
Markus joining the band in 2001 took the band on the path it still is on today while Juha moving from behind the drumset to the vocals and the music-style becoming what it is today. Demo "No Relief" saw the daylight in 2002, followed by "Shooting Star and Sindrome in 2003. Trip to Norway in march 2004 resulted the band's first gigs outside Finland and Sinthrone came back with the cd "Rockin' In Finland, Rollin' In Norway", split EP with few norwegian and finnish bands. Marja Tyni (keyboards since 2001) left the band later the same year,and she was replaced by Tiina. The gig at Nuke 44 (5.2 2005)was recorded and released as a cd "Live 2005".
