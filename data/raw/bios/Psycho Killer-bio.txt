Psycho Killer is a song title taken from the Talking Heads: 77 album which is where a common interest in music was shared between founders Rebecca Bueno and Rudy Martinez in the Summer of 2010. A few months later, a project was started by the two and they began playing fast and hard riffs. Together, they formed the appropriately named PSYCHO KILLER and played a gig together in April 2011. However, Rebecca opted out due to school and other personal matters. Rudy sought out help from a high-school friend, Tyler Toles, who gladly accepted the offer of playing drums in her absence. From then on, their style has progressed and taken a turn, according to our friends, for the best. Months passed, gigs were played (and missed, respectively) and Rudy dropped down from lead frontman to bring in a mutual friend between the band to do vocals; Juan Estrada. Wanting to bring in a fully dedicated member, Rudy was contacted by Jake Sotelo (ex-Capsaicin) with an offer to play bass in the band. A days crash course of our songs and Jake was welcomed in as Psycho Killer's first and final bassist. in a midst of turmoil and indecision, Juan was let go due to personal issues and lack of time. Rudy knew that frontman duties would have to fall on him, for he knew he wanted no one else doing vocals. A short search and he discovered that Michael Villalba (ex-Hammerhead) was dormant and was looking for a band to play in. Needless to say, he was brought in as our new guitarist and our new friend.
Fresh-faced and with an arsenal of riffs, Psycho Killer is looking towards the bright future in playing shows, chilling hard and leaving their mark.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Psycho+Killer">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
