According to their Myspace Profile "Greg and Inara met a few years ago. Discovered a common love of jazz standards...nerded out for a couple of hours playing every song they knew...and then wrote and recorded a record together." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Bird+and+the+Bee">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
