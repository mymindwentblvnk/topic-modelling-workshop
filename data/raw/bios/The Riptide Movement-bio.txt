After the fantastic success of 2009, a top twenty debut album "What about the tip jars", 2 top twenty singles "Bringing down the House" and "Alive Inside" and supports with James Yuill, The Corona's, Jack L and The Blizzards.

 The Riptide Movement invite you to ride the crest of a new wave, back from the south of France and straight into the Grouse Lodge recording studios, the lads are putting the finishing touches onto the eagerly anticapted follow up album "Hot Tramp", delightfully catchy songs like an orgasm in your ear they'll leave you begging for more. The first single from "Hot Tramp" "Hard to explain" was released on April 16th on the back of a tour of Dublin, Cork and Belfast with the Jim Jones Revue which enjoyed 3 weeks in the top 50 of the Irish charts.

 And with appearances at the Vantastival, Leixlip, Dunbrody,SeaSessions, Glasgowbury, Volvo Ocean Race, Indiependence and Electric Picnic this Year, as well as a tour of Germany in October, 2010 will be the year the Riptide Movement herald their arrival onto the global scene.
