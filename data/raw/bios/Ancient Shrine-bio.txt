formed in nov 2007 by Inanimate and SaTwE.
First demo, named Ancient Shrine, self released in early 2008 in a few copys.
After 1 year of military service, essentially lost time, we recorded several tracks.
We rerecorded, after that, 4 of our best songs in our opinion to form a new demo.
After several problems in our work the tracks are ready for our latest 
demo called The Ruins of my Failure. Stay tuned!!
