Cirrhosis were formed in the late 80s in the state of Minas Gerais (Brazil), in Uberlândia to be precise. The band was formed by Wagner "Antichrist" Lamounier along with two others when Sarcofago was put on ice for a while. Wagner soon left because he was in the process of recreating Sarcofago. The main topics of this band are alcohol, sex and death, and this is their style: Death Metal in the old way. It is said that they had no bass player in the beginning so they simply invented one called "Homem Invísivel" which is nothing but the combination of the two words "man" and "invisible" in Portoguese so this "guy" was called "The invisible man". It is said that they are active now but it isn't for sure. At least they released an album in 2002 while they were split up since 1992 or 1993.

Cirrhosis was also a Death Metal band from New Jersey in the early 2000's. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cirrhosis">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
