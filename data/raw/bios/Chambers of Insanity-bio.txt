This fellowship of sexual tyrannosaurus beasts was formed back in the glorious year of 1999 by Adam and Luke, to be nothing more than a jammin' garage band. And jam they did.
-They chose their weapons; Adam on drums and Luke on guitar.

By 2004, after a slight line up change, the catapulting of Dwayne from bass, and a few new members, they took it to the stages to wage joy and glee across the land. They got paid in beer... and they were happy.
-It was now Luke on vocals, Marshall and Nathan on guitar, David on Bass, while Adam remained on the drums.

In late 2005 and early 2006, they hit a few brutal, tyre popping potholes and decided to take a break. With the guitarists and bassist leaving to take up other projects, and singer deciding to gallivant across the ancient lands of Europa in 2008, this break turned into a hiatus.
-And then there were two; Adam went to guitar, while new member, James, took drummer duties.

Five tortuous years later, the hiatus was finally over and the quest was now on for new members. They found two young whippersnappers who were keen to join this gorgeous outfit of gentlemen.
-The 2010 line up looked a little like this; Luke on vocals, Adam and Jonesy on guitar, Davey on bass and James on drums.

And finally, the present; after the banishment of Jonesy in late 2011 and the abandonment of James in early 2012, it was all but three handsome men left in the fellowship. The three of them are currently pushing on and preparing for the upcoming release of the band's debut album 'Morningstar'.
-The current line up of these sexy beasts is Luke on vocals, Adam on guitar and Davey on drums.

We'd like to thank all the previous members of this band for their time and effort: James Grubisa, Nathan Jones, Adam Manuel, Nathan Salwowski, David Hentzschel, Marshall Earnshaw, James Epstein and Dwayne Murray. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Chambers+of+Insanity">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
