Creepy, acid drenched Krautrock fuzz, Seremonia worships at the altar of MC5, Coven and even early Alice Cooper but without aping them.

With lyrics all in their native Finnish, and the swirling echoes of male / female vocals, and the slightly robotic, but also weirdly erotic voice of vocalist Noora Federley, it seems that Finland has spawned one of the most surprising bands of the Folk / Psych / Occult renaissance. If Seremonia‘s self-titled debut wasn’t released on Svart Records this year, you’d swear to have unearthed a long lost private pressing from the moment the sixties turned into the seventies. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Seremonia">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
