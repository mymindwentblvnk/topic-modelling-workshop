"Galen" was a band formed in 1993 by Wolf Eyes member Aaron Dilloway, Julie Ann Huntington, Justin Allen, and Timothy Monger. Galen released 1 cassette on Sasquatch Records (which was later reissued on Hanson Records), 1 7" on Bulb/Hanson Records, 1 Split cassette with Lab Lobotomy on Hanson Records, and 1 LP on Hanson Records. When Galen disbanded in 1996, Dilloway, Huntington, and Allen formed "The Hercules". "The Hercules" released 2 cassettes on Hanson Records, "The Galen Via Hercules" and "The Hercules". When "The Hercules" disbanded, Huntington and Dilloway formed "Man Machine", which did not last long.
