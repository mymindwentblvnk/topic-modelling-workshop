Formed in November 2008, Arcane Deception is undoubtedly one of the eastablished metal acts in India! Combining influences from a wide variety of genres, the band has created an overpoweringly heavy, yet melodious sound which they can proudly call their own! The band has had many notable wins to its name including the prestigious Avalanche (NSIT) and Blitzkrieg (IIT Delhi) and has shared the stage with international acts like Sylosis (UK metal Giants) and Textures (Djent metal from Netherlands)! Apart from the frequent pub shows, the band has been headlining rock shows in numerous colleges across the country and has established a dedicated fan base! Look forward to some kickass music as we release their self titled debut EP at Cafe Morrison in the 17th of April!

It was only yesterday that we were in the hostels of Delhi College Engineering wrecking havoc in an otherwise peaceful locale. After intense jamming much to the pain of the warden and the guards we started having a cult following in the campus.One such night in a semi inebriated state we structured a song that is now formally known as "pain arcane".This is where things really took off.The acceptance and response of the crowds to the single was staggering even to crowds not fans of metchul.
