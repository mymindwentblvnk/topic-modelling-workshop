In 2003, DJ Peter Visti and studio wiz Jakub Meyland teamed up through friends, and immediately found out that they shared a mutual passion for creating music. Their love of music has spawned several 12" on labels such as Warner, Music for Dreams, Bear Funk, and Eskimo. Apart from this, their tracks have also appeared on several compilations like Hotel Costes and synced up for film and TV soundtrack work. Because they're both Geminis, the vibe in their studio can become fairly tense, and sometimes result in hour-long discussions on music, music history, musical taste and life in general. This however, is also the essence of their partnership. A musical marriage. A no-compromise approach to loving and creating music.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Visti+&+Meyland">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
