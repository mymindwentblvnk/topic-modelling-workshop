“Chaos meets atmosphere, brutality meets beauty. That's two ways of describing An Abstract Illusion's ambient-influenced Death Metal.

Hailing from northern Sweden, An Abstract Illusion was formed in 2007. This trio draws inspiration from genres such as electronica, jazz and progressive rock, which makes for wildly varied music where no song is the same as the other.

In the summer of 2014 the group released their debut-EP 'Atonement is Nigh', garnering interest from all over the world. 

In July 2016 the band released their debut full length, 'Illuminate the Path'.”
