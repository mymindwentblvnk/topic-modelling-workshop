The band is formed in April 1997 in Sofia , Bulgaria . In the beginning In Somnus are : Marian Atanassov - male vocals and main songwriting , Svetlana Bozhinova - female vocals , Alexander Tabakov - guitars , Ivan Peikov - guitars , Gueourgui Tonev - bass and Dimitar Barboutov - drums . The musical orintation of In Somnus is gothic - doom metal with permanent dialogue among the rough male and kind female vocals , which appears to be the main concept of the band at this time . In the summer of 1997 In Somnus appears on the Bulgarian underground scene , taking part in one of the biggest local underground festivals , The Summer Chaos fest in Bourgas . Thenafter the band plays on lots of others underground concerts , but never outside Bulgaria . In September 1997 , In Somnus records their first demo album in Graffitti Studio in Sofia . The album is engineered by Ognian Kyossovski and is later released as "Somnus Est Imago Mortis"EP by Counter Attack Productions ( a little Bulgarian label ) . Unfortunately , after the recording of the album the band encounters some personal problems . Dimitar Barboutov and Alexander Tabakov leave the band and are quickly substituted by some new musicians . The newcomers are : Ivan Andreev - keyboards , Maria Andreeva - violin and Pavel Ianev - drums . Naturally , these new members bring new influences and much kinder type of sounding to In Somnus . The band takes part in some underground festivities and concerts and does some songwriting . Everything seems to be fine , but in the summer of 1998 Svetlana Bozhinova and Pavel Ianev leave the band . In Somnus takes long rest searching for some new concepts and ideas as for a new drummer . <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/In+Somnus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
