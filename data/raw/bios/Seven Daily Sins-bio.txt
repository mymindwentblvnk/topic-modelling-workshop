Seven Daily Sins started in 2006 in Minsk, Belarus, by members of a few local bands. Having recorded the first EP Psychache in 2007, the band stepped on a less beaten path, which could be heard on 3-tracks demo Sculpturing Void (2009). Experimenting with twisted, layered death metal and jazzy/math vibes, the guys continued writing, and by the end of 2009 eight songs were ready to be recorded.

However, it took one more year before the recording actually happened, as one of the guys had to move to Europe for a better job, so the band could afford a good studio. Eventually, summer 2010 saw 7DS recording their debut LP in Polish Studio-X (Sceptic, Yattering, Anima Damnata, Antigama, Vesania) with producer Szymon Czech.

Eclectic, nervous and unrepetitive, the album got titled Say Yes to Discomfort - as a tribute to all the unrest and passion the band has put into its creation. The LP was released in 2011 by Soulflesh Collector Recs.
