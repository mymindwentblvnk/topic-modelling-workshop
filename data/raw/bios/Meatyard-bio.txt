There are two bands that share the name Meatyard:

1)Meatyard is a Grinding gore splatter porn band from AntiChristchurch, New Zealand.

The members are:

Nathan Nunbutcher - Vocals and Guitar
Decomposing Daniel - Drums
Chris Corpsebuggerer Rigby - Bass

2) Meatyard is also a Folk/Americana band. If Leonard Cohen had a country band, maybe he would sound something like Meatyard. Or if Stephin Merritt from the Magnetic Fields ever played with Dwight Yoakum (and he should, shouldnâ€™t he?), they might come up with this sort of stuff.  

The line-up of the band changes from project to project, but songwriting is handled mainly by the brother team of Josh Welsh and Philip Welsh. Josh plays rhythm guitar and sings with Molly Hansen, who also plays cello. Slide and electric guitar are by Rupert Sandes (The Boxcar Belles), bass & harmonica are provided by Martin Garner (formerly with the Asbestos Sisters and Claudine 3); and drums are by Kevin Jarvis. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Meatyard">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
