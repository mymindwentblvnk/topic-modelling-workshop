2.) The New Philharmonia Orchestra of MA, Inc. (New Phil), founded in 1995, is a 75 member non-professional regional orchestra based in Newton and presenting performances in Wellesley, Newton, Natick and from time to time in Framingham and Boston. “Music of, by and for the people” [The Boston Globe] encapsulates the spirit of the organization.

From the outset New Phil’s motto, MUSIC FOR ALL, has been our mission. The orchestra advances its mission by presenting programs of diverse repertoire of classical and light classical music for the enjoyment of audiences of all ages and experiences from a variety of urban and suburban communities. At the same time the orchestra strives to provide its non-professional players the opportunity to achieve a high level of ensemble performance not otherwise available.

The New Philharmonia Orchestra is a member of the League of American Orchestras and the New England Orchestra Consortium. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/New+Philharmonia+Orchestra">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
