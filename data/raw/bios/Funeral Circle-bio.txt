FUNERAL CIRCLE was formed in 2006 by the magii Matthew "Pilgrim" K. and Steven "Heretic" M. with the intent to summon unspeakable terrors into the world. Upon the departure of Heretic in 2007, Ian "The Lord Saddler" T. and Matthew "The Grand Inquisitor" E. were beckoned to complete the circle. Growing weary of destroying false metal, The Lord Saddler left later that year, and The Grand Inquisitor summoned his magick axe. 

In 2008, a cryptic demo was released on tape - limited to 100 copies. Zak "Blackthorne" G. was burned at the stake by Michael "Malphas" C. and replaced him subsequently on bass guitar. In the year 2009 , FUNERAL CIRCLE performed their first ritual - Sinister Sacrilege - released by the Miskatonic Foundation.

In 2011, Steven "Heretic" M. returned to FUNERAL CIRCLE along with new vocalist Jeremy "The Revenant" H. and completed a ritual with fellow doom magickans LORD VICAR - on the FUNERAL CIRCLE side they featured an original track entitled "The Hexenhammer" and a cover of the hymn "Burning a Sinner" by the legendary NWOBHM group WITCHFINDER GENERAL.

In 2013, FUNERAL CIRCLE released their first self-titled full length debut through reputable heavy metal record label Shadow Kingdom Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Funeral+Circle">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
