Beyond good and evil as Nietzsche would have it. Within a singular mind, Ashtorath is darkness. Mistake not its soft tones and distant hymns - it is built upon the foundation of art, poetics, and all that is gloom. Transcending mortal coils of contemporary lyrics or simple chords, trends and fashions, time and space... I set out to try something new, to keep the feel of real instruments alive while touching upon the experimental, to bring forth various styles; metal, classical, industrial, ambient...to meld these elements of art, music and poetry together into a darkened ethereal brew. 
The philosophy has long stood; attune instruments and equipment to wind earth and storm, and convey what the mind sees - as with careful meditation - reflecting the substance and origin of things as transparently as possible. 
Ashtorath is the grim, saddened, beautiful, hideous tale of all and nothing. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ashtorath">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
