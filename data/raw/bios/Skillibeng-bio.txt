Becoming a major player in dancehall with debut single "Brick Pan Brick," Jamaican musician Skillibeng built an international audience in the early 2020s with his trap-focused approach to the genre.

Born Emwah Warmington in St. Thomas, Jamaica, Skillibeng first started making music in high school before beginning his solo career while working at his father's company. A near-death encounter convinced the vocalist to commit to music full-time: Early tracks released in 2015 and 2016, "Skilli She Love" and "Bruk Up Party," took an electronically-led approach to the genre. But it was the 2019 hit "Brick Pan Brick" that would prove the artist's breakout moment. Encouraging hustling with its money-centric verses, the multi-million-streamed track found immediate success in Warmington's home country. From there, Skillibeng had a relentless release schedule, dropping 43 singles in 2020 along with his debut album The Prodigy. Among the highlights were his second major hit, "Mr. Universe," the Quenga collaboration "Not," and his third smash hit, "Crocodile Teeth," which got a remix by Nicki Minaj. In 2021, Skillibeng continued the rapid release pattern with 38 more singles, second album The Prodigy: Ladies Only, and third album Crocodile Teeth LP. As well as hits like "Coke" and the "Crocodile Teeth [Remix]," the artist took promising new directions alongside collaborators including Sleepy Hallow ("2 Sauce [Remix]"), Unknown T ("Wollan"), and Popcaan/Rich the Kid ("Rocket Launcher.") ~ David Crone <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Skillibeng">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
