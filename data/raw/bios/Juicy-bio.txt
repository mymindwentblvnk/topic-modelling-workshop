Juicy may refer to three acts:


1. Juicy was an American R&B band active throughout the 1980's, founded by the brother and sister duo Jerry and Katreese Barnes. The other members were:

Wyatt Staton (guitar and lead vocals)

Allison 'Ali Bob' Bragdon (tenor sax and vocals)

and John 'Stovepipe' Tucker (drums and vocals).

Their biggest hit  was "Sugar Free", and peaked at #16 on Billboard's R&B charts in 1986.


Katreese Barnes (January 3, 1963 - August 3, 2019) also was the musical director for the long running sketch comedy show, "Saturday Night Live".

2. Juicy was also a New York-based indie powerpop band formed in 1993 by Kendall Jane Meade (guitars/vocals), Lisa Marafioti (guitar), Jenn Levin (bass) and Meaggan Ward (drums).  The band released two albums:  'For the Ladies' (1993, after which Marafioti left the band) and 'Olive Juicy" (1996).  While Juicy disbanded shortly after its second release, Kendall Meade pursued a solo career under the name Mascott.

3. Juicy is also the name of a pop/rnb duo from Brussels, Belgium.
We are Julie and Sasha and together we are JUICY, a music band from Brussels. We started playing at parties around Brussels two years ago as a 90s RnB and hip-hop cover act. Today we have our own songs, which we’ve been performing on stage since March 2018. We released our first EP Cast a Spell, and there’s another on its way.
