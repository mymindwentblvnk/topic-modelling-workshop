2) Emerging from the talented life-spring of Los Angeleno hip-hop artists is the Hawaiian born lyricist NEILA (Pronounced: Nay-La). In the midst of a culture clearly dominated by patriarchal poetry, stands a female who is confident with her intensely personal lyrical content and straight up storytelling abilities. Her first full length album, "Vertical Trees with Eternal Leaves" (2003: Tracks from: "Vertical Trees with Eternal Leaves") is a testament to NEILA'S ability to run with the best of them; as all sixteen tracks meld into one anticipatory breath that will definitely stand as a solid starting point for a career that is sure to become extremely prolific. NEILA is interconnected with the branches of: DJ ESP, Myk Manson, OD, Daddy Kev, Liferexall, Beond, Kilani, 2Mex, and the rest of the heads from: LA2THEBAY, Asita Recordings, and Acid Reign. Listening to NEILA'S music will have even the most hardened critic's finger stuck on the repeat button.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Neila">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
