Family of the Year is a 6 piece indie/folk band from Los Angeles, California.  They have released one EP: 2009's "Where's the Sun"; and four albums: "Songbook" (2010), "Loma Vista" (2012), "Family of the Year" (2015), and "Goodbye Sunshine, Hello Nightime" (2018).

Family Of The Year is considered to have a "feel good summer" sound. Statements around the web have been made such as "Immediately I was overtaken by the Beatles sounding, toe-tapping, move in my seat beat..." and "Although the band only has six members, it still seemed like there were a lot more bodies contributing to the musical goodness that is Family of the Year. Perhaps it’s just their soft harmonies, comforting guitar chords and melodies that just pull us into their world that make us think that. Whatever it is, we just know we’re fans." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Family+of+the+Year">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
