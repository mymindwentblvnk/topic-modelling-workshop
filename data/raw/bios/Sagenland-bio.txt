Sagenland is a black metal project from Twente, Netherlands featuring members from Cultus, Heimdalls Wacht, Uuntar, Asgrauw, and Meslamtaea. Their music is inspired by the likes of early Ulver, old Dodheimsgard, and Arckanum. Sagenland plays folk-injected black metal with a focus on melodic bass and soaring choral vocals over a rich, traditional Scandinavian black metal sound. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sagenland">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
