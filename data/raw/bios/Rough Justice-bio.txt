After getting started in 1987 through an ad in a local music store, Rough Justice quickly gained a strong following throughout the south with their intense live shows and well-crafted 80's/90's style metal. They shared the stage with some of the best of the era including: Aldo Nova, Roxy Blue, Babylon A.D., Shag Nasty, Sage, Mad Hatter, Hypertribe, H88, Arch Angel, Justin Heat, Stiff Kitty, 15 Strings, Lipstick, Jackyl, and many more club favorites, playing everywhere from St. Louis, Nashville, Memphis, Atlanta, Johnson City, Myrtle Beach, to many local concerts in East Tennessee. After 4 years of touring and making music together, the members of Rough Justice parted ways. Most of the members went on to perform in other bands & still play today. This page was set up to share some of the good times we had & to hopefully connect with our fans & friends...new & old. Rough Justice played it's final show on November 2, 1991.
