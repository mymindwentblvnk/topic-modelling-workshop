After a pair of huge releases on their own imprints On-U Sound and Tectonic, dub warriors Adrian Sherwood and Pinch finally deliver their long-awaited debut LP "Late Night Endless". Using their chest-rattling live show at Tokyo's Sónar in April 2013 as the catalyst for the full length, the individual strengths of each producer are a perfect fit; with Pinch’s complex drum work interlocking with Sherwood’s spatial electronic dub imprints.

Dark moods are prevalent from the off, with the visceral voodoo dub of "Shadowrun" bleeding into the frazzled assault of "Music Killer Dub" with vocals from Congo Natty and the legendary Lee "Scratch" Perry. Softer, more alleviating is "Wild Birds", meandering over a lucid rhythm with tinkering piano keys and whispered vocals, whilst the tight hand drumming, juddering bass probes and middle eastern flavour of "Africa 138" displays the potency of these two masters on the ‘floor. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sherwood+&+Pinch">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
