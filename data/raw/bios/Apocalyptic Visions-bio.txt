Apocalyptic Visions is a Black/Death metal band from Atlanta, Georgia.

The band's lyrical themes center around the apocalypse, hatred, and the destruction of mankind. In keeping with this theme, the band members take the names of the Four Apocalyptic Horsemen: War, Plague, Famine, and Pestilence, and their live shows incorporate imagery and effects to express their lyrical themes. 

Stylistically, their music is closely rooted in early death metal and thrash, with an occasional touch of black metal. 

Their first album, Doomsday Device (2006), was self-released. The band is a staunchly independent entity, refusing to sign to any label. They are currently in production of their second full length album, which is expected to be released in 2008. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Apocalyptic+Visions">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
