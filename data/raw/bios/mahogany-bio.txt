1. Dream pop band Mahogany was formed in December 1995 by Allysa Massais and Andrew Prinz, who shared a love for composers such as Debussy and bands such as Section 25. In February 1996, Larry Hofmann of Burnt Hair records saw the duo play one of their first shows in Lansing, Michigan and later released a split twelve-inch with fellow Lansing band Auburn Lull. After Prinz's sister Marissa joined on keyboards, Mahogany released the Dual-Group EP and received airplay on the John Peel show in the UK. Over the next two years, they released recordings on Tinseltones, Liquefaction and Clairecords, as well as the What Will Become of the Key of Reason? EP in 1998, a joint effort between Clairecords and Mahogany's own label Disques de Simultanes (Simdisc). Later that year, the band recorded its debut full-length The Dream of a Modern Day, co-released by Clairecords and Burnt Hair (later re-issued by Darla) and included Jesse Rafferty of Asha Vida on percussion. After that record was recorded, Massais left Michigan to continue her studies in sculpture, while the Prinz siblings recorded songs under the name Mohagonny. In 1999 they changed the name back to Mahogany, while also moving to Brooklyn, New York, where they were joined by programmer Robert Pietrusko and guitarist/vocalist Lorraine Lelis.
