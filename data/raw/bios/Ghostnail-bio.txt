Ghostnail was formed in the late summer of 2004.
It all started out as a side project from Faerie GhostMothers, Pirate Ghosts and Elf Ghosts former band Hurt (aka Mrs. Whore). The demo that was released was originally only intended for internal use, but seeing how the band was successful and started to gain notoriety and fans, we decided to let the public have it their way. Now, a good two years later, here we are, a full-fledged band ready to take on the world! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ghostnail">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
