A french Metal band Formed by Frederic LECLERCQ (vocals / guitars, also in Dragonforce),Pierre-Emmanuel PELISSON (bass), and Max PILO (drums).

Formely the musicians of the acclaimed euro speed metal band HEAVENLY.

Although proud of their past, they looked for a new sound to fit in their real tastes and roots.
PELISSON clarifies the radical change: “Fred never really liked this style (euro speed / melodic metal) in the first place (...) and while I liked this style, I grew tired of it, and came back to my original love (heavy metal, thrash metal) and discovered more death and black metal”.
After many tries, the band found a proper session guitarist in Nicklaus. this talented and passionate multi-instrumentist musician was the missing link that the band was searching for.

In May 2005, Maladaptive locked themselves up in studio to record a second demo, eventually more powerful and agressive than the previous one. Although a release date is undefined for the moment, some excerpts might be on the official website soon.

In 2008, former Carnival In Coal's singer Arno Strobl joined the band.
