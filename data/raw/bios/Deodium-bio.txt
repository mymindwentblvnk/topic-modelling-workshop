The band began in year 2008, when all of the band members started to train on their respective instruments (from scratch). The first official rehearsal was held on May 31, 2009, which is also considered the band's founding date.

For almost two years the band only practised and played covers; however on the summer of 2011 the band started to write their own music and now the new EP “Servants of the Sun” has already seen the light.

During the years couple of the band members have changed. The first bassist became the lead singer, and the band gained a new manager and a new bassist to fill in, but the core has stayed the same and the spirit will not alter.


"We are a Latvian heavy metal band, with some death/black metal influences. 
We mainly speak of modern society's degradation through the lens of mythical creatures and epic events in our native language."
