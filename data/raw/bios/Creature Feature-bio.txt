There are multiple artists under the name of Creature Feature:

1. Comprised of the vicious vampiric vocalist Curtis RX and the ghoulishly fiendish organ master Erik X, the California native horror attraction Creature feature is set to take the underworld by storm. Creating a haunting mix of vintage horror visuals, old school beats, a carnival feel and a strangely rebellious approach to the modern ideals, the two monstrous musicians weave tales of the macabre, creating anthems for the horror minded and horror born alike. Tread carefully and enter their world cautiously, for once their talons are in they are a cancer you can't get out. 

2. Another band with the same name that formed in the 90s and have released one album - Retrodemon 263 - and disappeared after its release.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Creature+Feature">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
