The Loveless began when three members left acclaimed death-doom act Saturnus, among them Saturnus chief songwriter, Kim Larsen. Moving away from the metal genre The Loveless play very dark, melancholic rock. The band debut was a 3 track demo recorded in 2000, followed by a full length release in 2002 called 'Star Rover'. Due to Kim Larsen's other musical commitments, like his :Of the Wand & The Moon: project the band has taken a long time to record anything new. In fact since the announcement in 2004 that a new album would come in 2005 the official website seems to have come to a complete halt.
