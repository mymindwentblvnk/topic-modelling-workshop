Formed back in 2005, Swedish band "Sarea" has been described as "a melodic punch in the face". The band recently held an acclaimed performance at the prestigious Sweden Rock Festival and we can't disagree with the fact that Sarea is definitely a heavy, melodic and aggressive machinery on stage.

 Alive displays an uncommon musical diversity where energy, power and melody mix into a precise hit parade. The melodies are always first priority on Alive, but aggression and fury are also delivered in a fierce tempo. The end result is a pacey album full of energy.

 Guitarist Johan Axelsson says: Alive was written and produced focusing on creating a cocky debut with major hit-potential. We deliberately chose to peel off unnecessarily complicated elements from the songs, which resulted in the longest song on the record clocking in only just over four minutes. "Straight to the point" has been the motto for the entire album.

 Alive was recorded and mixed during 2009 in Sarea's hometown Norrk√∂ping together with Daniel Gese and Marcus Lundberg and later on mastered by Peter in de Betou in Stockholm. The album includes guest appearances by Tomas Lindberg (At The Gates, Disfear, Skitsystem) and Sebastian Roos (Liverpool, Shineth).

 Sarea deliver modern, melodic metal cast in aggression, and their album Alive was released in late 2010. Make sure not to miss out on this mind-blowing debut.
