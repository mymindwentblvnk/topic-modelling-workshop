"Sado-grind" metallers NAKED WHIPPER follow the path of deliberate intent to shock. Mainman Dominus A.S. left BLOOD in 1993 to concentrate on NAKED WHIPPER, which until then had been a side project.

NAKED WHIPPER were augmented in the studio by MALAPHAR musicians Markus and Oliver. The first fruits of this liason was a three track demo featuring 'Hyperincest', 'Anal Queen' and 'Pagan Pussy Gore Intruder'. This cassette was eventually pressed as a limited edition of 500 7" singles.The album contains such sensitive odes as ''The Ultimate Molester' and 'Perverse Delights'. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Naked+Whipper">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
