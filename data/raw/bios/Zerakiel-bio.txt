ZERAKIEL  is a finnish band that was formed at the end of the year 2009. They come from the little village called Hankasalmi. Originally Zerakiel was formed for only a one gig and back then the songs consisted from many different kind of cover songs. How ever, shit happens and the band kept going. 
Zerakiel started to make some own material slow but sure. The genre of Zerakiel's music is quite hard to define because the band takes their musical influences from so many different styles of music. But as the band itself describes it music, it should be called some kind of black met... melodic metal and hard rock. 

In autumn 2011 Zerakiel visited at the Studio Watercastle in Jyväskylä where they recorded some of their first songs with the assistance of Arttu Sarvanne. After three days work Zerakiel's first demo "Night Overture" was born.

In summer 2012 band headed back to the Studio Watercastle. After about a week-long creation process the Zerakiel's first ever EP "The Decay Within" was complete.
