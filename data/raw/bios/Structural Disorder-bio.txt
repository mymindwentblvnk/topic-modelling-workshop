A PRELUDE TO INSANITY makes the introducing chapters of the story of a man who suffers from a severe psychosis after finding out that he is about to be
a father for the first time in his life. The psychosis manifests itself as a voice that commands the man to kill his pregnant wife and his unborn child. After committing
this crime the man ends up at a closed ward where he only has got himself, his questions and his memory gaps to accompany him.
During sessions together with a psychiatrist his memories slowly start to return and the man realizes more and more what he actually has done. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Structural+Disorder">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
