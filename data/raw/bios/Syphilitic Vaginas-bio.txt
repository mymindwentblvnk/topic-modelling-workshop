Often mistaken as a Japanese band, Syphilitic Vaginas is a destructive/satanic Swedish metal punk-band with strong influences from first wave black metal acts like Celtic Frost, Hellhammer, Sabbat and 80s hardcore/crust punk bands like Zouo, G.I.S.M. and Mobs. The band formed in 2005 and has released several split albums, EP's and more. There is not much known about the band members, except the fact that the following persons (pseudonyms) are in the band: Yusuke Flamethrower, Haruko Outlaw and Masaru Iron Bitch. Rumours go that Syphilitic Vaginas is a side-project of the guy behind Netjajev SS from Sweden. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Syphilitic+Vaginas">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
