Dub Taylor is the alias of Berlin based, dub-inflected deep house producer Alexander Krüger. Dub Taylor scored a sizable dancefloor hit with "I Can't (Fall in Love With Another One)" in 2000, his second 12" for Force Tracks; the track employed a huge, throbbing 4/4 rhythm endrenched heavily in an ambient dub sheen topped off with some sappy New York garage-style, heavily accented male diva vocals courtesy of Per Fourier. The track put Krüger's Dub Taylor moniker on the map (in addition to his host of aliases) and set the stage for his debut album, Forms and Figures, on the esteemed Raum-Musik label in early 2001. Like the I Can't 12", Forms and Figures made waves -- Krüger's deep, minimal style of house and its occasional forays into vocal territory certainly proved itself in demand. Less than a year later, Force Tracks issued another Dub Taylor full-length, Detect. The album rounded up ten of Krüger's tracks from 2000 and 2001, including "I Can't," and functioned as a perfect introduction for the unacquainted. And considering the Force Inc. empire's reach and influence, many were indeed introduced to Krüger's work. In addition to the aforementioned higher-profile releases on Raum-Musik and Force Tracks, Krüger also released Dub Taylor material on the Konfekt and United States of Mars labels. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dub+Taylor">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
