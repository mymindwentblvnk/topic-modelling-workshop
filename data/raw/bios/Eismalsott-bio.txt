Eismalsott is a German black metal band formed in 1998. The black metal style the band played was very experimental. One demo called "Snow White" was released in 2002, one EP called "Best Before: Spring" in 2004. Among the experimental use of guitars, especially on "Best Before: Spring" you find a lot of samples, all from the Chinese movie "Hero". 
In 2005 Thalos, Alboin and Cypher D. Rex left the band to form Geist. Since then Eismalsott has been on hold, it's unsure if there'll be any other releases by the band as Ainvar is the only member now.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Eismalsott">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
