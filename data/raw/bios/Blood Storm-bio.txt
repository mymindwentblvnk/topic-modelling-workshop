Bloodstorm were formed in 1994 in Philadelphia, PA, United States. At the time of their debut album; "The Atlantean Wardragon", their style was a somewhat oldschool like hybrid of early Death and Thrash Metal with a clear hint to Black Metal. "The Atlantean Wardragon", the only album reviewed here, is a very raw and primitive album with fast and raging songs. While most bands in the genre are all fast and blurry, Blood Storm know how to write good songs with cool riffing (while still being all fast and blurry). Apparently they have swifted to a more Black Metalish style of music, although the corpse paint is not a gimmick as Mezzadurus already wore corpsepaint on "The Atlantean Wardragon", which was clearly more rooted in an Oldschool Death Metal feel than being an all out Black Metal Assault.
