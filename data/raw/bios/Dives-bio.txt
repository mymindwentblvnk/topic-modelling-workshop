Formed in February of 2016, ever since the Viennese underground scene is shaken up by their surf-ish sound. Dora De Goederen, Tamara Leichtfried and Viktoria Kirner first met at the Austrian Girls Rock Camp in 2016. In spring 2017 they’ve recorded their self-titled mini album with Austrian musician and producer Wolfgang Möstl (Mile Me Deaf, Sex Jams, Clara Luzia, Melt Downer …). This gem was released on Siluh Records in Fall 2017, including six songs as fresh and innovative as DIVES themselves. Confidence and passion are what let them finish their first album that fast and resulted in DIVES rising to a fixpoint in the Austrian Indie scene. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dives">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
