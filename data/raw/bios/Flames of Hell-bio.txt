Flames of Hell were a black metal / thrash metal band from Reykjavík, Iceland.  They formed in 1984.  The status of the band is disputed.   The band consists of  Steinþór Nicolaison (vocals, guitar),  Sigurður Nicolaison (bass) and  Jóhann Richardsson (drums).  They only released one full-length album in 1986 called Fire and Steel.  There were rumors of a new album in the works since 2002, but not much info known about the status of the album and it's not known if it's finished.  The Nicolaison brothers shortened their surname to Nicolai at some point in time.
