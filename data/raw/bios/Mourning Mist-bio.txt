Mourning Mist was conceived in 2013 by a trio from Perugia; Ecnerual, Chris and Mid. Early in 2014, bass guitarist Kvasir joined the project.

The aim of the band is to grow in the metal scene and to grab the attention of all who yearn to share in their mysterious qualities.

The band members’ determination is to create music that characterizes the Umbrian lands from a “dark” and unconventional viewpoint. Hence their resolve to continue working on new material, for future release, which will develop an expression of the introspection of those who view life through alternative eyes.

Despite Mourning Mist’s concentration on the creation of new music and the band’s aim to record new albums, the future could well hold live performances.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mourning+Mist">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
