Patrick Holland, originally from Vancouver and based in Montreal, has gained a steadily growing global following over recent years in the underground house scene with left-of-center releases under his aliases Project Pablo and Jump Source and with his own label Verdicchio Music Publishing. He started producing downtempo tracks under the name 8pm in 2012 before moving to Montreal in 2014. While many of his peers at the time were playing trap, he was more interested in house music, as well as more laid-back sounds such as boogie and yacht rock. After debuting with two EPs (Utensils and Basic) on Hybridity Music in 2014, he released his debut full-length, I Want to Believe, on taste-making Vancouver label 1080p in early 2015. The release established Project Pablo as a name to watch in the underground house scene, and he built up a steady touring schedule across North America and eventually Europe.The year 2016 brought releases on labels like Royal Oak (One for Some), Lone's Magicwire imprint (Priorities), Church (Jervis Pump Station, with Wolfey) and Holland's own Sounds of Beaubien Ouest (Beaubien Dream). He also collaborated with Priori as Jump Source, releasing the Guide to Action EP on ASL Singles Club. The label also issued Warm for a Long Time by 2 Responsible, Holland's duo with Max McFerren, in 2017. That year, Project Pablo EPs appeared on Let's Play House (Risk the Rip), Technicolour (Hope You're Well), Club Lonely (Night Shift), and Spring Theory (Scented Trip). Another Technicolour EP, There's Always More at the Store, followed in 2018. A full-length titled Come to Canada You Will Like It appeared soon afterwards. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Patrick+Holland">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
