Mammal Hands is a British jazz band from Norwich. Members include brothers Jordan Smart (on saxophone) and Nick Smart (on piano) together with Jesse Barrett (on drums and tabla).

Brothers Nick and Jordan Smart had previously played together as an electronica duo but when, in April 2012, drummer Barrett joined the band, they developed their unique bassless sound drawing on their shared love of electronic, contemporary classical, world and jazz music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mammal+Hands">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
