Energy is an American band formed in Stoughton, Massachusetts in 2006. Energy draws from a wide range of musical influence from Hardcore punk bands like Misfits, Rancid, AFI, 7 Seconds, Minor Threat, and Black Flag, to other influences such as Weezer, The Smashing Pumpkins, The Cure, and The Beach Boys. 

Energy has been the primary musical outlet for Singer | Songwriter Jason Tankerley since he formed the band in February of 2006. Over the last decade, Energy’s musical direction has changed greatly. Energy's signature style of somber, melancholy melodies and introspective lyrics combined with infectiously poppy hooks has truly cemented Energy / Jason as one of Boston’s most unique artists. 

Jason’s vocal delivery has been compared to the likes of Davey Havok, and Michale Graves, while adding his own vast array of vocal influences to Energy’s music.

After releasing their 2006 E.P. “Punch The Clock”, under Rock Vegas Records, the band immediately developed a cult following nation-wide, and signed with Boston’s own “Bridge 9 Records” to release their 2008 full length album “Invasions Of The Mind”, as well as their 2010 E.P. "Walk Into The Fire". 

After becoming the sole songwriter for the band in 2012, Jason began writing songs for what would eventually make up Energy’s 2016 album “Apparition Sound”.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Energy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
