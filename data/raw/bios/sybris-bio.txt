Sybris has been around. In the background of your photos, slightly out of focus. Hiding in the shadows of the side stages of Lollapalooza, Austin City Limits and Virgin Festivals but feeling most at home in a smokey bar on a tiny stage.

Sybris has released two albums, their self-titled debut on Chicago's Flameshovel Records and their recent release, 'Into The Trees' on San Francisco's Absolutely Kosher Records.
