Familjen ("The Family") is the name used for the solo electronic music projects of Johan T Karlsson. Hailing from Hässleholm, now living in Stockholm, Sweden.

Johan started off hanging out in local studio Señorita in Hässleholm which more and more became his own. He became something of a house producer, recording all sorts of music just because he could. Sounds have always been easy for him, caressing sweet hertz, disbanding the nasty. 

He never really thought that he could release something of his own. He started making small instrumental pieces just because he liked the sound of it, playing small naive melodies just to have something to listen to. Just fingered on the instruments and listening to his analogue delay, tweaking on his little black boxes, dancing in the studio with his friends and bottles. 

People are persistently calling him and the last months he’s been playing all over. Up until now Johan has been performing alone with a mic cable around his neck, pushing his black box, dancing and switching things on n’ off, but just recently it was decided that his close friend and Hässleholm colleague Andreas Tilliander, will join in, helping out with samplers at live performances. 

Familjen is playing at this year’s Hultsfred festival and his debut album “Det snurrar i min skalle” was released in March with hit singles and videos and such.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Familjen">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
