On! Air! Library! was a Post Rock/Ambient/Experimental rock band from New York City. Twin sisters Claudia Deheza and Alley Deheza met up with Phillip Wann to form the group back in 1998. Through playing at local venues and parties the trio eventually landed a deal with Arena Rock in 2002, and in 2003, a split record with The Album Leaf exposed the band to a wider audience, paving the way for their full length, self titled, debut album in 2004. In that same year they embarked on a nation-wide tour with Interpol and The Secret Machines. However, in 2005, On! Air! Library! disbanded.  Claudia Deheza & Phillip Wann then worked together in Daylight's for the Birds, but Claudia has since left that band.  Alley Deheza went on to form School of Seven Bells with former Secret Machines guitarist Benjamin Curtis, and her sister Claudia has since also joined the group.  Claudia has also worked with Scott Herren (Prefuse 73 and Savath & Savalas) on a project called A Cloud Mireya.
