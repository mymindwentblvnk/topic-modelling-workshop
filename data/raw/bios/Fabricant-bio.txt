Fabricant began as a school project of sorts. The task was simple: learn recording techniques and record a demo. As things were coming together, original material was written, whole songs took shape, and recording techniques were being learned, the duo decided that Fabricant was going to be more than just a school project. Thus Fabricant was destined to break free of its humble beginnings. With the demo released and a full line-up on the horizon, one can expect Fabricant to be gigging, writing, recording, etc. in the near future.
