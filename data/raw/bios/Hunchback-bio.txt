Hunchback was a 5-piece punk band from NJ (2001-2008) known for their intense performances and fierce DIY live-free-or-die integrity.  Drawing heavily from horror culture, they crafted a kind of noise-surf-synth sound that howled, screeched, skulked and was entirely unafraid to experiment.  Totally weird, and totally punk.  Influences include The Ergs, Killdozer, the Jesus Lizard, Scratch Acid, Angry Samoans, Mudhoney, Neil Young, Butthole Surfers, Nirvana, Big Black. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hunchback">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
