As well as being the co-founder of Numbers – one of the UK’s fastest rising record labels and party planners – Jackmaster is one hell of a DJ. Having absolutely obliterated the final segment of this 2010’s Sonar By Day festivities with his unrelenting selection panache, he proved as adept at maiming big crowds as he is at keeping those London basement venue goers from hanging around outside smoking.

For Jack, turning in epic 6 hour sets at your friends’ 30th birthday party is his lifeblood – the man literally lives to play records for people – and his eclectic sets skip through everything, embracing guilty pleasures and forgotten classics in the same breath as he does unreleased dubplate heaters.

With the Numbers label housing the elite of today’s producers – Deadboy, Redinho, Jamie xx, Untold & Roska, SBTRKT, Lazer Sword, just for starters – he’s steadily building his reputation as a taste-maker within the bastardized swamp of bassed out club music, as well as being one of the most emphatic party selectors.

With residencies in his native Glasgow and at London’s sturdy underground institution FABRIC, as well as parties happening sporadically around the globe – from Barcelona and Paris to Tokyo – there’s plenty chance to experience him for yourself. The announcement of his forthcoming contribution to the esteemed FABRICLIVE mix CD series and recent bookings at some of the most respected of clubs like Optimo, FWD>> and The Berghain, whilst being voted in as Best British Breakthrough DJ of 2010 (DJ Mag), have only cemented his stranglehold on the dynamics of a soundsystem and as an alumni of 2010’s Red Bull Music Academy, you can guarantee this is just the start for the incredibly coiffured DJ. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jackmaster">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
