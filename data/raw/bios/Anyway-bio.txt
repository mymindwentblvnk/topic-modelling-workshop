There are 3 bands with the name Anyway:

* Anyway was a band from Prague/Melnik in Czech Republic, (www.anywaymusic.com) in 1996. Great punk'n'roll act, btw. Their first record Golf Club came out at Day After Records (2002), second entitled Dead End was published by prague-based label Silver Rocket Records (2006). The third album burden was published by Election/Tchichimania Records (2009). The fourth and final selftitled album anyway was published by Election Records (2011). ANYWAY are fucking DEAD from 2012.

* There is a second artist using this name - a rock band from Chemnitz, Germany.

* And there is a third one in Basle, Switzerland (www.anywayinfo.ch). Sadly, they may not carry on for much longer, as the lead singer and core of the band passed away in October 2006.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Anyway">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
