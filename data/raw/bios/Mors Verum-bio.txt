Inspired by old school death metal, experimental and progressive music, Mors Verum has been on a journey since 2015. Mors Verum explores philosophies about death and other-worldly perspectives which hugely inspires them in their creative process. These interests have also contributed in forming their band name - Mors Verum (latin) ,which is a paraphrasing of "truth in death". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mors+Verum">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
