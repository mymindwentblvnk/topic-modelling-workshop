Ivan Alekseev (born 9 march 1985), also known as Noize MC (which is also the name of his band), is a rap rock musician from Moscow, Russia. He's one the most famous russian freestylers known for his tongue-in-cheek lyrics. In 2003 he founded a band called "Protivo Gunz" which later became a full live line-up of his every show. However having two names was inconvenient, so after signing a record deal the name "Protivo Gunz" was dropped and "Noize MC" became a full rap-rock/punk rap band.

Line-up:
Ivan «Noize MC» Alekseev — vocal/guitar;
Aleksandr «Kisly» Kislinsky — bass;
Pavel «Pa$hock» Teterin — drums;
Maxim «Inspektor» Kramar — guitar/synths.
