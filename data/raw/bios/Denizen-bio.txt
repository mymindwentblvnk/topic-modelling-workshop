1. French stoner/ hard rock/ hardcore band

Denizen formed in south of France between Montpellier and SÃ¨te in 2003. After a first demo / EP and a first album, 'Far From Common Strategy' (2006) issued on the label Prototype Records, the group participates in a split tribute to Black Sabbath with the bands Illtemper and Stuntman. Denizen then appears on a compilation produced in collaboration by Prototype Records and the Temple of Noise fanzine which found among other Tantrum, Basement, Marvin or Year Of No Light. A second album, 'Snatches Into Uproar' was released in 2009, still on Prototype Records. Denizen begins to move towards a more rock groove with Sludge and Stoner influences. http://denizen.bandcamp.com/
