Melodic death metal band founded by Evan Pontell-Shafer. Drawing on many different aspects of music but favoring the darker ones, New Jersey’s Eternity Void created dark atmospheres and haunting melodies that chilled to the bone. Blending their gloomy aura with absolute brutality, the band’s sound was described as “ambient black metal,” and “classically influenced.”

Eternity Void appeared with the likes of Type O Negative, Morbid Angel, Krisiun, Deicide, Cradle of Filth, Goatwhore, The Black Dahlia Murder, Cattle Decapitation, Exodus, Nile, Hate Eternal, Mastodon, As I Lay Dying, and more.

The Void have gone on hiatus since 2007. Evan has resurfaced with a new metal duo, Sadgiqacea.

Eternity Void released two discs in their time:
Torrents Of Devastation (2005)
To Conjure Black Circles (2005) <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Eternity+Void">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
