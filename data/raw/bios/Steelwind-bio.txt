The Steelwind band was formed in 1999 by Guitarist; Kevin Humphrey, and Drummer; Artie Jones. Soon after Keyboard player; Billy Oliver, Bass Player; Fidel Gutierrez, and Guitarist; Michael Clary joined the Progressive Rock team.
After several jam sessions and a few gigs, the band went into the studio and recorded their first release entitled; "Heaven's Calling" in 1999, released it in 2000. The Heaven's Calling CD generated many fans world wide which birthed alot of live venues, and enticed the band to make plans for yet another CD release.
Soon after, Steelwind hit the studio again and began it's work on recording the second release; "Jawhook", which finally came out in 2002. Although the Jawhook release was still considered to be 'Prog' Rock', it just didn't seem to be accepted as well by the fans as the Heaven's Calling release, which makes sense, as Jawhook had a few milder tunes on it than the Heaven's Calling CD.
After the Jawhook release, the band decided to take a break for awhile, except for Kevin.
Kevin had alot of musical material in his heart and head that just "had to be" recorded and released. So,...Kevin set out on his own and began writing, composing, and recording a 'solo' release. The solo CD was set off under the STEELWIND name as; "The KH Project" in December of 2004.
Some assumed that Kevin's solo release would probably be an acoustical guitar, vocal project, but this wasn't the case at all.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Steelwind">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
