From a land known as the midwest (USA), stand four men, destined to bring new life to the stale state that has overcome the music industry of today. From it's humble beginnings back in 2004, Red Desert has been through highs and lows, seen it's share of lineup changes, and at one point almost disbanded. But one thing always stayed constant, the love for the music they played and created. While only one original member remained to carry forth the torch, the music always seemed to have a haunting effect on surrounding ears, and it wasn't difficult to find good musicians willing to put forth the effort to maintain the Desert name. Not giving up to the hardships that lay before them, the band marched on, bringing in new blood, and a confidence to finish what they started. Lacking a recording under their belt to properly portray the sound of the band was disheartening and also hindered them to say the least. Fast forward to the fall of 2008. Knowing damn well it was time to put up or shut up, the band headed into the studio with Adam Tucker, to record a six song EP entitled 18 wheels. With a good dose of what their band is about, this recording has songs ranging from the early days, to more recent with it's current lineup. Feeling more focused than ever before, Red Desert will be releasing their long overdue cd in the start of 2009, while also concentrating on writing new material as well. Stoner rock, riff rock, desert rock...call it what you like. These boys bring their own brand of heavy rock n roll to the table, adding to a genre that has proven it's a force to be reckoned with!  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Red+Desert">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
