1. British Girl Trio consisting of Aisha, Chantal and Sabrina, viewed by many as a "grown-up" version of girl group Cleopatra. They had moderate success with their hits 'Dayz Like That' and 'So Long', their biggest hit was 'Sweet Love 2K' which peaked at number 3 in the UK charts, and was a cover of Anita Baker's classic.  The version of "Sweet Love" that features on their only  studio album Right Here Right Now was produced by Jeremy Wheatley and Magnus Fiennes. The single version was re-titled "Sweet Love 2K" and was produced by Stargate. The girls disbanded after member Aisha left the group.
