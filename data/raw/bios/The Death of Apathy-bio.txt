At the beginning of 2005 two former members [Dominik, guitarist and Mathias, drummer] of the Emo/Indie band Speechless Morning decided to stop wasting their tears, to move two steps forward and to take a more aggressive route. So a Metalcore/Progressive Band was born. As a matter of fact they needed a bass player and it turned out that Tobias was the right person to do a well job. To round everything up they searched a vocalist who fitted into their harsh style of sound. At first Moere tried to shout his guts out of his stomach, but this plan failed and so they decided that Möre should play the bass and Tobi would play the second guitar. After rehearsing a few songs they started to look for a propper frontman/vocalist again. Dominik, who had known Christopher from a few concerts at the café Schlachthaus asked him if he wanted to try. Christopher agreed, and he turned out to fit perfectly into their machinery. 

They played their first official concert in Reuthe in May 2005 with their former name DYING DEGREES. After playing some gigs dying degrees decided to change their name in THE DEATH OF APATHY. One and a half year after birth of TDoA the band started to record their first demo with Werner, the singer of HAL, a trashmetal/core band from Vorarlberg. Directly after recording the demo, Tobias left the band due to his study plans and was replaced by Martin, a close friend of the band.

THE DEATH of APATHY played shows with DEADLOCK, BRIDGE TO SOLACE, DARKEST HOUR, THE BLACK DAHLIA MURDER, DEAD TO FALL, FALL OF SERENITY, CEPHALIC CARNAGE, WAR FROM A HARLOTS MOUTH, WITHIN WALLS. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Death+Of+Apathy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
