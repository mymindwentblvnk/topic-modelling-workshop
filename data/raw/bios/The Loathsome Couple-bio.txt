The Loathsome Couple is a 3 Piece Psych/Sludge Metal Band From Seattle

They play a bleak down-tempo blend of Sludge Metal with Hardcore and Psych influences thrown in for great measure.

Their new S/T album is a 6-Song 47 minute masterclass of Down-Tempo Heavy-Pounding Sludge Riffage.

The band mix different genres into their music with great success. Throw in Hardcore, Death Metal, Noise Psych and Doom Metal for an album that truly stands out in their respective genres.

If you're into THOU, EyeHateGod then you going to love these guys. The album is superbly produced from start to finish. Every note is played heavy, loud and brutally raw at times to give this an edge over their rivals.
