There are 3 bands called Rapid Fire:

1. RAPID FIRE is an Italian power metal band born in 1998 in Milan from the rustless passion of three friends for 80s heavy metal and Running Wild.
In 2001 they released "Rapid Fire", the first demo of three songs, "The Rising March", "The Tempest Of Fear" and "Red Passion". 

 Rapid Fire released the first album, "Scream!", in december 2004 with label "Adrenaline / Steelheart Records", and promoted it with many live dates. 

After the original lineup disbanded, guitarist Marco Poliani and singer Antonio Pecere (already singer with Betoken, Komaday and Sigma) joined forces again to find new members and rebuild the band. Adding Marco Maffina on drums to enhance the foundations of rhytmics and Cesare Ferrari (previously playing with Blindness, Garden Of Madness and Shark Eye) on bass to complete the new lineup, Rapid Fire is back on the road!

Currently working on second record "Too Loud" while touring in northern Italy.
