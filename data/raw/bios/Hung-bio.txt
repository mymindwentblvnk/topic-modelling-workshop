Hung is an Extreme Progressive Metal band from the United States. The violinist Lyris Hung gives the name to this band which is quite an original mixture of melodic death and black with progressive elements, plus the unusual addition of a electric violin. 

HUNG is also the name of another progressive metal band from Worcester. HUNG is a purely digital project that was originally made as an example of Barney Oakleys mixing abilities for Crossfade Productions.
Though it started as merely a pseudonym for studio production capabilities it has rapidly become an impressive musical project that is carving a nice niche in the progressive metal scene.
All the production, writing, recording and artwork for HUNG is done by Barney Oakley, also known for being the vocalist of Elements. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hung">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
