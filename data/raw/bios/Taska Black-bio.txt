Taska Black is the artistic vision of Belgian songwriter, producer, and multi-instrumentalist Joachim Gorrebeeck, who’s quickly established himself as one of the most exciting new artists in the dance & pop music ranks on the strength of his forward-thinking, genre-defying sound.

His unique approach and ear for melodies caught the ear of bitbird founder and tastemaker San Holo in early 2016 who featured Taska’s single “Leave Me” on the label’s debut compilation Gouldian Finch. The record exploded to the tune of millions of streams and was heavily featured across the festival circuit with some of the biggest names in EDM playing the record.

That success led to the opportunity for mentor San Holo to tap the budding producer for two official remixes for his own work on “Light” and “The Future” respectively before releasing two more powerful singles on bitbird in “Where We Go” and “Dreaming” firmly capturing the eyes and ears of tastemakers across the dance music space and establishing himself as the next big thing on one of the most curated labels in electronic music today. He wrapped up 2017 in style too making his label debut on indie tastemaker Lowly Palace with “Nothing Lasts.”

2018 sees Taska picking up right where he left off with a string of successful singles and broadening his horizons with successful label debuts on Monstercat and Seeking Blue with “We Would Never Do” and “In Your Eyes” respectively. With both singles he also showcased his skill as a multi-instrumentalist with live session ‘b-sides’ to them both separating himself from the pack with his classical training. He also had the time to release a debut music video for the frantic and manic production “Dead Inside.” <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Taska+Black">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
