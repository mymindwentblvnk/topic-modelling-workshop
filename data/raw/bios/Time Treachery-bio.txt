Time Treachery is a five piece melodic/epic death metal from Zadar,Croatia. It was formed in the late winter of 2007 by couple of very good friends: Marino Brnardic, Kristijan Bajlo and Bruno Vuksan-Cusa. After some time of jamming they started working on their own material and tried to find two more members to complete the line-up. Andrija Javoran joined as a guitar player,but a proper keyboardist was very difficult to find. The first demo "Under Eternal Nightsky" was recorded in the summer of 2007.

Just before the release of the demo medical problems forced Andrija to quit playing guitar. He was thinking about leaving the band, but fortunately he accepted the band's suggestion to take up keyboards,because he attended musical school and knew musical theory very well. In a very short time the line-up was finally completed when Marin Kolanovic joined the band as a new guitar player. From that point Time Treachery started playing live shows.

For some time everything in the band worked pretty good, but as time passed things with Marin started to go downhill.The chemistry between him and the rest of the band simply did not work out, so he left Time Treachery. He was instantly replaced by Josip Ivkovic, who brought a lot of positive energy and new ideas into the band. After that Time Treachery again started to play live shows,work on the new material and with full speed headed towards new experiences. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Time+Treachery">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
