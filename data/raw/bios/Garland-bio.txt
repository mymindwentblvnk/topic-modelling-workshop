Indie/Reverb Rock band in the vein of Radiohead, Starsailor, Sigur Ros and like acts. Dreamy, atmospheric melodies for lost loves and broken hearts will cast a spell of nostalgia and leave the listener itching for more. Currently anchored in Los Angeles after spending time in Nashville and NYC. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Garland">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
