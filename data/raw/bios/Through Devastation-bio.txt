Through Devastation is a Metalcoreband from Chemnitz, Germany. They started out in 2003 with the intention to play hard and agressive music. After some LineUp changes the first demo songs were written in 2004. But during this year some heavy problems occured forcing the band to split. At The end of 2005 the bandmembers decided to ressurect the band but slightly changed the musical direction into what it is now: A mixture of melodic leads, breakdowns, straight forward riffing, that is influenced by a wide variety of multiple genres. As the LineUp was completed in early 2006 Through Devastation started to write the songs for the first demo 'Bridges Built In Ruins', which was released in late 2006. At this time the band started to play gigs in their hometown chemnitz and later on throughout saxony. At the end of 2007 the band decided to enter the studio to record the first album, which will be released in March 2008. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Through+Devastation">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
