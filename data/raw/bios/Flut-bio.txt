FLUT - VIENNA - 2015

In a plain present, an anchor in the past can lead to the enhancement of established patterns. Decelerating images in VHS-style, supported by 80s synthesizer melodies, balanced guitar harmonies and mighty drum sounds are the catalysts of the process, which the music video to Tiefschlaf generates. While sliding into the gloomy atmosphere of the setting, decorated with relicts of a distant past, it becomes clear that this alternative draft to modernity doesn't lack of currentness. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Flut">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
