David Kennedy’s work as Ramadanman and Pearson Sound has always had a particular slant and a percussively textured style all of his own that’s often layered with thick and potent bass frequencies and synth washes - but it seems like with recent material like ‘Work Them’ (released on Loefah’s Swamp81 imprint) Kennedy is simply toying with the world’s expectations of him.

As a key component behind some of the most daring dancefloor music, both as a producer and as a label owner – Kennedy co-runs the Hessle Audio imprint, alongside Pangaea and Ben UFO - he’s travelled the world numerous times over releasing music by key producers like Joe, Elgato and James Blake as he’s done it. Scoring his label a well respected residency at London club, fabric and more recently, starting his own vinyl only night called Acetate in Leeds, his knack for working over a dancefloor shows no sign of waning. Finding the perfect space between bass bin and monitor he’s constantly innovating, refusing to sit still and feeding off all kinds of temperate influences – from old house to Chicago juke music - the end of 2010 and into 2011 sees him hoarding an array of productions that are absolutely battering soundsystems, radio shows and eardrums alike.  

In 2011 he has (to only some degree of surprise) released several classic-sounding yet unique and modern house tracks (including a 12" with two originals, 'Babeh' and 'Satisfied') under yet another alias, Maurice Donovan, further perpetuating his efforts to distance images and words from the music.  His first work under this name would be a remix - Julio Bashmore's "Battle For Middle You (Maurice Donovan Dub)", followed by the 12" on the record label SSSSS.  He continues to release new styles of music and tour Europe and North America bringing the sounds of UK underground bass music to cities from coast to coast to coast. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ramadanman">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
