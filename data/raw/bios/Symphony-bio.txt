2. Symphony was formed in 1995 in Poland.. Its first members (Lars, Maniek, Bambosh, Maly and Mlody) played music inspired by doom metal. At first the band was named Dark Doom. The first demo tape was recorded in 1996 and the band changed the name to Symphony of Despair. In 1998, after many personal changes, the band recorded its first significant material entitled "PÃ³lcienie" ("Halfshadows"). 
The band was an instant hit in the underground scene till '99. Then the lead guitarist (Andrzej) and the bassist (Bambosh) left the band, and musicians abandoned playing. But in 2001 they discovered that they could not live without music and started to look for a new guitarist, and a bassist. Two musicians - Soki, the lead guitarist, and Prins, the bassist - joined the band. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Symphony">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
