There are five bands using this name:

1) A symphonic black metal one-man band from Malta. Sauron composes all of the music for Apotheosis. Although the band was formed in  autumn of 1993, it wasn't until 2002 that Sauron released a full-length album, the four-track epic Farthest from the Sun. Other releases include the demo recordings Shadows Eve and Promo '97 and the Bathory cover "Total Destruction". Sauron has said he's still working on material for the project, but it's unknown when he'll release further material.

4) Apotheosis is the alias of two producers from Belgium, Luc Rigaux and Patrick Samoy, who were influential on the early techno and electronic scene. They're largely known for the early 90s club hit, O Fortuna, which samples the "O Fortuna" movement of composer Carl Orff's famous Carmina Burana.
