Metal quintet MUDSLIDE consists of a handful of young musicians with a burning ambition to let themselves be heard and seen. With years of experience, a solid, devoted fan base, 3 self-financed and critically acclaimed EPs and past concerts with bands such as KILLSWITCH ENGAGE, TEXTURES, THE RED CHORD, AUGUST BURNS RED, MISERY INDEX, ORIGIN, FROM A SECOND STORY WINDOW, HATESPHERE, MERCENARY, THE PSYKE PROJECT and SUBMISSION the band knows what they want and strive hard to achieve their goals.

"COLLISIONS" - the newest outing from the young metallers - is infected with cold, mindnumbing soundscapes and outburst of raw, dark energy. Once again the band has been invovled in every aspect of the release, from recording and engineering to production (with mix and master by metal guru Tue Madsen) and artwork, and "COLLISIONS" portrays a band exploding with energy and will, a band ready to expand beyond the borders of Denmark. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mudslide">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
