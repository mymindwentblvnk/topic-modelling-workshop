BACTERIA (1): japanese hardcore/post-rock band.

Bacteria (2): Formed in the 90s after performing all over North America with Moev front man , the Late Dean Russell and guitar sideman Eh Stewart, the hard drinking hard hitting musicians had such a hell of a great time performing for sold out venues with Dutch Goth god Xymox that 8 months later, the Duo carved out the blistering dark album "Identification". Completely recorded in a small one man studio at the infamous Vancouver drug corner Hastings and Carrall street (the poorest postal code in Canada.), this 9 song collection was created though limited in its distribution it only charted in various college station across Canada,  With just a few university and art shows under their belt, the duo satisfied their art and stomaches by busking in the anti-buskings streets of Vancouver, selling cassettes and subsisting on pizza and beer. Russell's involvement ended in 1992 and Dean withdrew himself from public performances and his fight for life ended in 1994. Going solo EH Stewart and  Countless Sessions later in 1995 a pile of song came together for "The Lost Years" Produced by top notch Mike Landolt (Sugarcult, Mushroomhead, Maroon 5.)
