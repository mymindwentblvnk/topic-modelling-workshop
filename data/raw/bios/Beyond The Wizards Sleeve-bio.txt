Beyond The Wizards Sleeve are Richard Norris and London DJ-cum-producer Erol Alkan.  Under this pseudonym the duo are best known for their successful remixes of Peter Bjorn & John, Tracey Thorn and Midlake. They released their debut album Beyond The Wizards Sleeve Ark 1 in 2008. Using their skills behind the boards, or magic spells, if you will, they cut-up and paste together old psych and Krautrock tracks, essentially pimpin’ them out. For example, “I Swim Around” manipulates Neu!’s classic “Hallogallo,” glazing it with freaky samples and backwards masking, while “Bubble Burst” edits a muscular backbeat loop into fiery guitar licks, beaming organs and a bongo clinic for a psych/soul explosion. After some hiatus they released their follow up album "The Soft Bounce" in July 2016 with vocal contributions from Jane Weaver, Hannah Peel, Mystery Jets’ Blaine Harrison, Euros Childs of Gorky’s Zygotic Mynci, John Savage and Holly Miranda. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Beyond+The+Wizards+Sleeve">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
