This project comes from the fog, the cutting wind of the mountain cliffs, the mysterious silence, from the mythological dream. Ancestral landscapes evoked by hypnotic, abstract and organic soundscapes. 
Wolfskin is a sensation, a dream, a silent and moisty cavern. A symbolic entity created on 1994 as a way of personal, animic and shamanic exploration. J.A. is the only fixed member of this portuguese ritual ambient project, although it included through the years a diversity of persons that had contributed decisively to the Wolfskin sound.
