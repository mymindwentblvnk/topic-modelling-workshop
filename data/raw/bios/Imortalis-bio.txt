Imortalis were born in late 1994 by the name of Infernais. After a few gigs in 1995 and formation adjustments, they recorded the first demo "Morbid Stupid" in 1996. This demotape opened some doors and Imortalis were invited to participate in the international metal compilation "High Radiation, Vol. IV" by Independent Records. More doors were opened and Imortalis started playing in clubs like "Hard Club", in Gaia, or medium festivals in the north of Portugal. After signing with Independent's sublabel for metal, Grade Records, Imortalis recorded their first album in 1999 that came out in the 13th May 2000, licensed in five countries. In that year, they were invited to represent Portugal in the commemorations of the 500 years of Brazil. So they did a mini tour in Bahia. There, they were interviewed by TVs like Rede Glogo, Record, newspappers and fanzines. Back to Portugal, they shared stage with bands like Xutos e Pontapés, Blind Zero, Bloody Tears, Behemoth, Painstruck, Oratory, The Ransack and others. They also were interviewed in TV show "Curto Circuito" at CNL (Nowadays Sic Radical). In 2003, they recorded a new demo for the second album and split up in december of that year, wiht five songs ready to be recorded. Imortalis played a reunion gig in August 30th 2008 in rememberance of the old times. According to Santa (Lead Singer) this was the last gig ever.
