Medicant Downline is the post-industrial, electro-rock creation of Randall Lewis (along with live contributions from "Danger" Dan Robinson and Will "Slick" Arther), based in Northern Connecticut, USA.  Mixing classic industrial rock influences with synth-pop programming and melodic vocal hooks, Medicant Downline hopes to continue to contribute to the resurgence of coldwave in the United States.  Crashing guitars, sweeping strings, supercharged synths, and pounding drums collide in a swirl of harmony and chaos, all within each track. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Medicant+Downline">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
