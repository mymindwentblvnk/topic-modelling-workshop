There are multiple artists named Dana Glover

1:
Born and raised in North Carolina, Dana Glover moved to Manhattan at the age of 16 to pursue a modeling career.  But after two years, she decided that music was her passion and went to Los Angeles to begin writing songs.  After playing piano in clubs for a while, she got her break recording film music, most notably the love theme from Shrek, "It is You (I Have Loved)."

After her initial success, she took on the project of releasing her own album, and Testimony was the result.  The fruit of Glover's own songwriting, the most recognizable tracks are probably "Thinking Over" (featured in the film Raising Helen) and "Rain."  The whole album, however, displays Glover's heavy soul and gospel influence and her passion for the music of the old days.  As the final track, "The Way (Radio Song)" sarcastically suggests, it's a really fine feeling what i'm feeling on the radio / 'cause i can hear the words but i just can't feel the soul.
