Roberto Cacciapaglia was born in Milan, Italy. He received his degree in music composition from the Conservatorio Giuseppe Verdi in Milan, under the direction of Bruno Bettinelli. While at the Conservatorio Giuseppe Verdi he also studied orchestra direction and electronic music.  He also has worked for the Department of Phonology at RAI (Italy's national television station) in Milan and has collaborated with the CNR (National Research Council) of Pisa, where he studied computer applications in the field of music.

Cacciapaglia is a prominent figure on the more innovative Italian music scene and a point of reference in Italy and abroad, for his musical research between classical and experimental electronic and direction towards music without borders that goes beyond divisions.

For some time, he was involved in studying sacred music and dance, and for a number of years he has conducted a research effort that studies the powers of sound. His music draws inspiration from these experiences and passes through emotions rather than through traditional rules and structure.

”SONANZE” (1974) is his first record, published by Rolf Ulrich Kaiser, editor of “OHR”, a German record company.  Through this work, Cacciapaglia entered into contact with various German music groups such as: POPOL VUH, TANGERINE DREAM, WALLENSTEIN, DIETER DARKS.
