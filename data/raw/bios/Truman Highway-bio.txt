TrumanHighway is a band from Boston, mass. Our goals have no boundaries. Our music is truly a melting pot of our influences, from the clear masters like pantera, down, black label society, black sabbath and brand new sin, to the new masters of the craft like the haunted, lamb of god and arch enemy. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Truman+Highway">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
