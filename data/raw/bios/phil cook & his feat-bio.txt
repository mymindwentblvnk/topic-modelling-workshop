Phil Cook, along with his brother Brad, are two-thirds of the North Carolina band, Megafaun. The third member is Joe Westerlund. All three members are from Eau Claire, Wisconsin. Both of the Cook brothers are very collaborative musicians and are often seen playing along with other local musicians when they aren't touring the world as Megafaun. Phil released a free album called Phil Cook & His Feat. "This album was made during a thunderstorm and its aftermath one evening in March 2009 in lovely Durham, NC. There were a few takes, one microphone, and lots of mistakes." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Phil+Cook+&+His+Feat">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
