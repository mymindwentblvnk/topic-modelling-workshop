In less than two years, Oso Leone (Mallorca, Spain) have developed a remarkably mature sound. Their 
unique coupage of styles combined with the power and confidence they exude on 
stage have won them a legion of faithful followers. Although it's very rare to hear 
such a perfectly polished and well worked sound from such a young band, it's even 
more unusual to come across a band that manages to improve that top notch velvety 
feel when playing in front of a live audience. Oso Leone has the rare combination of 
skill, passion and charisma... and they show it.

With a fine balance of folk and rock, as well as clear ethnic elements to their 
rhythms, Oso Leone manage to create ethereal melancholic atmospheres where 
crystal clear melodies melt in to rich hard basslines and smooth lucid voices tiptoe 
around solid rock structures.

Oso Leone is delicacy and tenderness that captivates you from the first chord. A 
warm, deep neomediterranean sound that flourishes in a gentle simplicity which 
lures you in to an enchanting trance. 
Oso Leone sounds like the sun as it dies at dusk on a warm summer's day and the 
waves crashing on the smooth rocks of a lost cove in their beloved Tramuntana.
