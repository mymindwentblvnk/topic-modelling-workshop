Merrimack is a French black metal band. Merrimacks demos have been drifting around in the underground BM scene for several years now garnering a cult following. Their first demo "Act1" was released in 1995. Merrimack was the first black metal band to play in Paris (1996 with Necromass and Dark Funeral). Rather than focus on mythology, Merrimacks members have elected to place a strong focus on the occult and the philosophical aspects of the black arts including an extremely religious approach to Satanism. They are currently signed to Moribund Records.
