There are two NS bands named Wewelsburg:

1) National Socialist Black Metal with Industrial undertones from Russia. The band name refers to Wewelsburg castle, which was seen as the ritualistic heart of the SS, where SS officers under the leadership of Heinrich Himmler conducted occult rituals. Also the rings of SS warriors who fell in battle were stored here. The band has so far released one full length and one demo and two splits. Members from this band all participate in side projects A.E.I.O.U and Varyag (arkona).
