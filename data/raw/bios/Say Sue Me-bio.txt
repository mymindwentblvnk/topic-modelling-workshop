They prefer to describe themselves as a band that plays surf rock and like a variety of 90's indie rock.  Some have categorized them as shoegaze.  Lead singer Sumi Choi prefers to sing in English, with a few tracks in Korean.

Damnably Records of London, England releases a compilation album of the bands previous releases with a bonus track on CD called [Say Sue Me], released April 2017 available from Damnably (Europe/North America) and via Electric Muse in Asia. 

Reviewing their 2018 release Where We Were Together in Pitchfork, Steven Arroyo notes that the band's "sweet spot" is  "familiar, wistful progressions complemented by Kimâ€™s interior detailing," referring to guitarist Byungkyu Kim.  Kim's "guitar warps, dilutes, and casts shadows over these songs, and his reverb placement reflects a well-versed ear." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Say+Sue+Me">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
