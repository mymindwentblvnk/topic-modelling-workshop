Dialectic Soul are SlavaZ (guitar), Sasha - (guitar, bass, drum programming), Galina (keyboards) and Billy (vocals) from Belarus. On 'Terpsychora' (2007) they play symphonic black metal with a catchy neoclassical pop twist. Vocals are harsh (death and black) mixed with clear ones. The overall sound is extremely melodic. They are planning a new release somewhere in 2008 called 'Painsoul' <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dialectic+Soul">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
