Libithum: Melodic black/death metal from the Netherlands! 

Libithum was founded in the summer of 2003. Since september 2005 we have played with a solid line-up with Dyon Croymans as vocalist/guitarist, Thijs Hubbers lead guitar, René Keppels drums and Jos Hebing bass. In 2008 Neal Din joined the band as the new lead-vocalist. August 2009 Dyon Croymans dicided to quit with Libithum and was soon replaced by Roy Ruikes as guitarplayer.

First we only played covers, but over the last 4 years we began te create our own sound. Our music can best be described as progressive death metal with black metal influences and heavy metal related guitar riffs. Fierce screams, blastbeats and fast guitar-solo’s are typical for our style. We only play songs written by ourselves, covers are the past. 

All members of Libithum have a lot of stage experience by now, not only with Libithum but also with former bands.

In November 2006 we’ve recorded our first demo at the New Road Media-studios. This demo is for free download available on our site. Nowadays we are one of the best-known metalbands in our region. 

By now we can play for about 1 hour live, but we’re in de process of creating new tracks so we can present 1 or 2 new tracks every live-show! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Libithum">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
