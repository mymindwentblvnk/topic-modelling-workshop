Dario Tronchin, also known as Chevel, was born during summer '89 in Treviso, Italy.

He started throwing parties in 2004 at local clubs such as "The Players", "Barchessa", "Toys" and "K3" playing mainly house and techno records. It is during this time that he got in touch with Fabio Jetleg, a local dj who soon became good friend, mentor and source of inspiration.

Immediately after, Dario started recording his own material under different names whilst the Chevel project landed to labels such as Safari Electronique, Meerestief and more recently the Berlin based techno label Stroboscopic Artefacts.
