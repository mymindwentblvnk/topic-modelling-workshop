Alias of Jan Jelinek. 
"The Exposures" is not referring to a fictional support band, it is rather signifying the music Jan Jelinek has himself exposed to. It is his sources and their samples which are obviously more exposed on this album than on his preceding ~scape album Loop-Finding-Jazz-Records. 
A similar hint on his frame of reference is found in the title of his third release on Klang where he releases under his alias Farben: Farben - Featuring the Dramatics.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jan+Jelinek+Avec+The+Exposures">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
