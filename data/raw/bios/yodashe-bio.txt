Yodashe is a London-based independent artist and producer with a background in architecture and design.

She debuted her solo electronic project in NYC as an alumna of Redbull Music Academy. She has since appeared in various electronic music festivals (Sonar, Todays Art, Reworks) and smaller clubnights (supporting acts such as John Talabot) while developing her experimental live set.

Her artfully mind-bending project brings together multiple influences (from classical choral music to indie-rock & avant-garde electronics) while embracing an architectural approach to sound design within a context of pop interrogation and deconstruction. She has previously received airplay on East Village Radio (NYC) and Red Bull Radio and self-released tracks via Soundcloud and NX Records.
