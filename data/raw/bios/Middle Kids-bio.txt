Middle Kids is an indie band from Sydney, Australia. In 2016 they released the single Edge of Town, a non-fictional account of a girl who got swallowed up by the earth. It is the lonely wail of a single slide steel guitar, the distorted mess of indecision, and the comfort of a familiar melody. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Middle+Kids">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
