Dzelzs Vilks (Iron Wolf in Latvian) is a Latvian rock band from Sigulda, Latvia  formed in 1991. They have received six Latvian Music Awards and have performed their energetic shows at the biggest festivals and events in Latvia, Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and Russian Federation.

The music of Dzelzs Vilks is heavy and melodious at the same time, borrowing elements from a wide variety of genres including rock, dark wave, synthpop, industrial music, and post-folk, but the band keep on searching for new expressions.

For the past years, Dzelzs Vilks has been strongly inspired by Latvian folk poetry called dainas, creating a unique fusion of original melodies and dainas lyrics in their own songs. This has brought two albums to audiences: Vakara Zvaigzne (Evening Star, 2006) and Uijā Uijā Nikni Vilki (Uijā Uijā Fierce Wolves, 2008) – recognized as the Best Folk Music Album at Latvian Music Awards 2008.

Their recent 2015 release Perfekta Rītdiena (Perfect Tomorrow) is their 13th full-length album to date.
