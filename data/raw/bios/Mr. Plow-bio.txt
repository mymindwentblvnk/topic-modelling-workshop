2) A Canadian solo act of angry angry anarcho-acoustic-folk-metal. Covering topics from necrophilia to transvestite love, this man has seen it all and is not afraid to let you know about it.

3) Mr Plow - a simple man with simple songs. A little bit country, a little bit rock 'n' roll, the rest prescription medicine & junk food.

Mr Plow has shared a stage a host of roots/country stars such as Eve Selis, Slaid Cleaves, Kim Richey and Kate Campbell. He's also played at Leicester's famous Summer Sundae Weekender festival.

His latest EP, "Four Murder Ballads", (available from Pink Box Records as download and 7" coloured vinyl) has received national airplay, he has recorded a session for Mark Lamarr's "God's Jukebox" show on BBC Radio 2 and he's been The Guardian's Radio "Pick Of The Day" (which means he's officially cultural).

He's starting to think about recording an album for Pink Box Records, for release in 2009 ...

In addition, Mr Plow is a proud member of The Soar Valley Wayfarers, a skiffle combo who first played together in 1956. Local music legend Kevin Hewick, plus tubthumper extraordinaire Uncle Flash, make up the rest of the Wayfarers.
