In the "anything goes" era consistency may seem to be a little bit dogmatic.
You can easily make a fortune out of ephemerality and for sure out of a "just for fun"- attitude.
But in the end consequence evolves out of somebody´s own history though you have to work it out first.

For GENERAL BOMB MACHINE the past is not dead, the past is vivid yet without retro- feelings.
The base is complex heaviness and the aim is to form annoying pictures.
It´s the fear of becoming random that drives G.B.M. into new worlds.
Some of them stay misunderstood, however, they hardly let somebody cold.

During their live performances conventionality is taken
- on behalf of the light and video show - an unreal atmosphere arises -
brute sounds, sickening pictures, dark light. No fun at all!

 It´s not about escape but about transparency of emotions.
