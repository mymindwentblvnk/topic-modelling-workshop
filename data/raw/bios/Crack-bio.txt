There is more than one artist with this name:


1) This Spanish band came from Gijon, in the northwestern part of the Iberian Peninsula. Its members were Alex Cabal (bass), Alberto Fontaneda (guitar, flute and vocals), Mento Hevia (keyboards and vocals), Manolo Jimenez (drums) and Rafael Rodriguez (guitar).

Their only album "Si Todo Hiciera Crack‚Äù ("If all fell apart") from CRACK is one of the jewels of the Spanish progressive rock. It contains seven tracks, all with a beautiful harmony created by the interplay between keyboards, guitar and flute. There are hints of early GENESIS (sensitive piano chords and moving Mellotron waves) and JETHRO TULL (flute) but the typical Spanish climate and the elaborate compositions makes this album to an enthralling and emotional experience. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Crack">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
