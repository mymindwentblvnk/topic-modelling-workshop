Jason Lakis started the band The Red Thread in 2002, put out 3 albums on Badman Recording Co., and disbanded in the summer of 07. He had been writing for his “solo project” since around the summer of 06, and a year later he found himself with an album’s worth of songs, which is what he dubbed Mist and Mast.

He sang and played all the instruments on the album except for a couple keyboard and guitar parts on the song Core Deep. Wanting to play the songs properly live, he enlisted a bunch of friends from San Francisco and Oakland to fill out the live band. The live band consists of Jason on guitar and vocals, Craig Adams on guitar, Bill French on drums, Ben Kasman on keyboards, and Alex Steinhart on bass.

He spent about a year writing and recording the album in his apartment in Oakland, CA. It was 
completed in July of 07. If you listen very closely you can hear his dog playing the jingle-dog-collar-I’m-reeeeally-hungry-scratchy-at-the-door. This will be the first album by Mist and Mast released on their own OPZ (Oakland Petting Zoo) label.
