The spirit has been withering since the year 2000, from when a huge amount of Swiss gigs have been played.
Through the years, the band had the chance to perform as supporting act for Blaze Bayley, Paul Di Anno and Eminence.

The shows led Soulline to win the W:O:A Swiss Metal Battle â€™08, Bern, and to perform at Wacken Open Air with Iron Maiden, Nightwish, Children of Bodom, Carcass, At the Gates and many more, on august the same year.

The band is now recording their second release which should be ready in the summer 2010, while continuing to follow their need to play live.

The music of the band leads to a certain open-mindedness and keeps at its heart the link to any feeling or sensation that constitute human being.
