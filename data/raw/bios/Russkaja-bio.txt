Russkaja is an Austrian Ska-Band from Vienna, Austria, consisting of Georgij Alexandrowitsch Makazaria (vocals / ex-member from stahlhammer), Engel Mayr (guitar), Dimitri Miller (bass, vocals), Mario Stübler (drums) & Hans-Georg "H-G" Gutternigg (trombone, trumpet), Rainer Gutternigg (trumpet) and Ulrike Müllner (violin).
Ex members are Titus Vadon (drums, vocals / ex-member from drahdiwaberl & das balaton combo), Zebo Adam (guitar, vocals / ex-member from hallucination company), Antonia-Alexa Georgiew (violin, vocals), Werner Köck (guitar), Manfred Franzmeier (saxophone / member from hot pants road club, ex-member from madrid de los austrias) and Christoph Schödl (drums).
Their music is a rousing mixture of russian folkmusic and ska / ska-punk. 
"Russkaja is the exact opposite of Easy Listening music, Russkaja - terror of terrors of all Russian folk music societies - stands for fat Austrian Polka beats. The group members are the most illustrious musicians of the Alpine region, who possess a colourful mix of cultural backgrounds. They pour these various cultural influences into a postmodern version of Russian folk and spread their distinctive music all over Europe. It is sweaty and shouts out loud: Dance Dance Dance! It is a clash of trash metal, world jazz, funky stuff and Frank Zappa-esque Rock. All these things signify: Get down to business!"


There is a word play in the name of the band: RUSSKAJA means 'russian'  on russian language, but it also stands for: 'Rus' = Russia - 'Ska' = style of music - 'Ja' = German for: Yes.
