The Tubes are a San Francisco-based theater rock band, popular in the mid 1970s and early 1980s, known for their live performances that combined music performances with many different unique costumes and in some acts they wore  leotards with painted on nipples and pubic hair.  They made satires of life in the USA; the media, consumerism, and politics. They were often banned in the Midwest USA. 

The Tubes continue performing live, with 4 members of the original band (Waybill, Anderson, Steen, Prince) still in the touring lineup.
