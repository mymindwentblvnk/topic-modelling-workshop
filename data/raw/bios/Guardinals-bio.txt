Guardinals the gothic metal band from Turkey,Izmir is composing and working since 2005. For about 7-8 years Bugra (keyboard) and Erdinc (Vocals) worked on some songs on computer, after they experienced the joy of their results they dreamt of playing these songs alive. Thus they started their search for band members.The first Guardinal to be found was Tevfik (Guitar) and that was the first breath of a new band.Just after Tevfik, his friends Caglar(Drums) and Cem (Guitar) joined the ranks. Although the band still needed some more fresh blood but they began to work. A few months later Cem's friend Bahadir (Bass guitar) accepted the band's invitation. Yet the band of Guardinals had the need for the voice of Irem (Soprano vocal) which was satisfied more than enough after she accepted joining. And nowadays after replacing their guitarist Cem with Yağız, they started working on their first album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Guardinals">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
