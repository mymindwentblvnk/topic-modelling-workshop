New Paradigm are an Adelaide four-piece metal band. Focussing on making their own sound rather than trying to fit a genre, they prefer to just label their music as Metal.
Faultlines, their debut album, is due to be launched July 20, with digital copies now available and hard copy presale orders now being taken.
Song writing is approached in a few different ways; Rubicon was the first song to be written by the whole band, and was done by jamming it out old skool. Other songs such as The Blood Born were conceived in a jam session with riffs being perfected and arranged by Sam and Lennie in their own time. Circles was written by Lennie using music arranging software to bring the idea to the band. Lyrics are often written by Lennie in his own time. This is just a few different ways they create their music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/New+Paradigm">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
