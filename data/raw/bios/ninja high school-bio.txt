Ninja High School were a positive hardcore dance-rap band from Toronto. They (coincidentally and unintentionally) have the same name as a comic book, which they're told is very nice. They also share the name with a song by the group Bis.

They are Matt Collins (lyrical geniusing), Gregory Collins (grunge yelling), Star DT (complaints), Anna Cvitkovic (good times officer), Adrian Cvitkovic (spiritual guru), Whitney Kemble (jerk), and Steven Kado (advanced hyping).

Past/peripheral/spiritual members include Wolfgang Nessel (rug-cutting), Peter Thorne (enthusiasm + filling-in), Craig Dunsmuir (hooting + carrying on), and Slavoj Žižek (NHS thank for the ideas). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ninja+High+School">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
