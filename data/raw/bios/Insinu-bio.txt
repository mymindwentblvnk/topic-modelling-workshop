Insinu is a groove metal (or thrash band, generally) from Ridgefield, Connecticut.

Insinu formed through a program called Rock On America with a local music store called East Coast Music Mall. Guitarist and Vocalist Drew Arcoleo and Richie Hume knew about the program and pulled the band together. Drew and Richie went on a search to find the most talented bassist and drummer in their school. They found both Steve Budlong (drums) and Jon Borden (bass).When Insinu first formed they went by Element but then they decided on the new name of Insinu. They formed in the middle of their sixth grade year all sharing the love of music. Everything went very well from there. After the innovative members started to get their own creative ideas, they started to write their own songs. The members of Insinu have been the same four people musicians since the very beginning. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Insinu">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
