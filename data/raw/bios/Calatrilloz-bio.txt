CalatrilloZ is the name of a Circus Family, protagonist of a tale created by the Brazilian Mr.Z (vocals) who,
after many years of singing Classic Opera, decided to create a new musical project.

Bizarrely enough, instead of starting from writing songs, he created a tale that could inspire his music.
This tale brought him to write songs mixing different music genres like Goth, Rock, Jazz, Theatrical Opera and Circus vibes.
The strong concept and the high desire to play made him move to London. While looking for the right people to take on board,
Z started to step into the UK music scene auditioning for different bands.

It was during one of this audition that he met YAMA (drums). The two played together for the first time sessioning for Wolfman (Peter Wolfe), opening for Pete Doherty at the Hackney Empire (October 2008). What a funny start!

Mr.Z introduced Calatrilloz to YAMAÂ who embraced the amazing concept straight away;
YAMA loved the music and joined the family. Shortly after the pair found AZRIEL (guitar)
and LANVAL (Bass) to complete the family at last!

Since, everybody worked hard to spice up the music, addingÂ their personal musical experience to give birth
to what CalatrilloZ sounds and looks today; together with the music Calatrilloz built up a strong stage performance using masks,
make-up and costumes.
