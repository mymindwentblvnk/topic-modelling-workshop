Florence Leontine Mary Welch (born 28 August 1986 in London) records as Florence + the Machine.

She is the daughter of Evelyn Welch, a Professor of Renaissance Studies and Academic Dean for Arts at Queen Mary, University of London and author and formerly a Studio 54 regular, Nick Welch, who works in advertising. Welch says she is prone to "falling into severe holes” that leave her crying on the floor. Welch has been diagnosed with dyslexia and dysmetria.

Welch would like to have a career similar to PJ Harvey and Björk who are "constantly creating new exciting stuff". At age 13 Welch found solace in the music of Hole, Nirvana, Green Day, Kate Bush, Annie Lennox, The Velvet Underground and Celine Dion. As a teenager she was the frontwoman for Toxic Cockroaches and Ashok. Feeling she was in "the wrong band" she got out of a contract with Ashok by resigning. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Florence+Welch">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
