Smokstack Lightnin' was considered one of the hottest bands in L.A. during the mid-1960's. Discovered by famed producer Bones Howe (Association, Fifth Dimension), the band was signed and first released recordings on the White Whale label. Later, the group was signed by Bell Records where the band's album  was released. Although several cuts from the album reached Top 10 status in numerous radio markets across the U.S., the group unfortunately was not able to achieve Top 10 nationally, although the album did make it onto the Billboard Top 100 albums charts. The group was featured at venues such as the Whiskey- A-Go-Go on the Sunset Strip, the Cheetah in Venice, in numerous concerts locally and nationally with many of the biggest and most successful bands of the day including groups such as The Doors, Creedence Clearwater, Dave Clark Five, Nitty, Gritty, Dirt Band, Three Dog Night, Ritchie Havens, Dion and many others. The band's singles and album continues to sell on the Internet and the sound holds up even after all these years. It should be noted that Amazon is somehow offering the album for sale in CD format, although this was not sanctioned by Sony/BMG who currently owns the masters. The Amazon CD is of inferior quality and should be avoided.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Smokestack+Lightnin%27">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
