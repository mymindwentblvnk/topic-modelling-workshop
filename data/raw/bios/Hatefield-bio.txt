HATEFIELD is a three-piece hard rock band from South Jakarta, Indonesia. On the evening of the 31st of August 2013, frontman Hanussa Hamzah ideated a concept band, choosing the theme of the greatest gift that God could give to humankind: HATE.

Hanussa asked his peers and a couple of strangers to share their hate life-stories, and in return he would create a song based on those actual stories. The outcome should capture the hateful spirits of the stories, but the intention is to turn it into a positive message at the end, teaching the owner of the stories to let go and carry on with their heads up - because most people keep their HATE inside, of which the result is often a drug addiction, depression, and suicide.

Knowing he couldn't perform live on his own, in parallel with song-crafting, Hanussa asked his best friend and former drummer of his, Ryanfeiza, as well as the recruit of his former guitarist, Anugrah, to join him in the journey of HATE.

Followed by the band's first practice, the trio created a never-heard-before hard rock band.

HATEFIELD Army was born.
