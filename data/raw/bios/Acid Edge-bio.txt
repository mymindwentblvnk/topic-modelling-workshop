5-piece metal band from Liverpool England playing a range of speed & death metal styles including doom (as shown in their song Eyes Wired Shut) with grindcore metal vocals from Neil Murphy.  They recorded 1 demo E.P. before the classic line-up disbanded, replacing members for a while before deciding to call it a day in late 2002. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Acid+Edge">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
