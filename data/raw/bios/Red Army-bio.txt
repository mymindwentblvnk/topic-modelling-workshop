1) Red Army was a Kazakh/Russian punk band founded in 1994 in Pavlodar, KZ by Kirill "Kirya" Zhuravlev (vocals, guitar) and Vyacheslav "Chifa" Chifin (guitar). Kirya's brother Anton "Baton" Zhuravlev joined later as a drummer, Kirya moved to guitar and Chifa took over the bass. The band has been performing live since 2000 after moving to Omsk, Russia.
Musically, the band was primarily focused on classic rock and roll harmonies wrapped by sleazy british '77 punk appearance, while typical social and political provocations and exposures prevailed lyrically.
Red Army gained its biggest prominence after their album "Kel Balalar Okylyk" (Let us learn, kids!) has been released by Neuroempire Records. The band members founded their own independent label Antihit Records, under which they have been publishing their albums. Disbanded in 2016.

2) Red Army was a New Orleans, USA based punk band active from 1988 - 1991. In addition to memorable performances at such landmarks as Storyville and Tipitina's, Red Army was notorious for their vocal opposition to racism during the height of David Dukeâ€™s popularity in Louisiana. In October 1989 Red Army recorded ten tracks at Stonee's Studio in New Orleans, four of which were released as the Misspent Youth 7" ep under the band's own Robot Tank label. All 500 copies were quickly sold after favorable reviews in MRR and elsewhere. Red Army reunited in October 2007 after seventeen years for Raise the Dead Festival II.
