M O T H X R is a four-piece formed in Brooklyn, NY, though the music is made wherever they meet. Traveling with minimal analog recording gear, they spent four weeks recording an album between Los Angeles, Chicago and New York. City shape sound.

The band's debut album, Centerfold, was released in early 2016 in North America on Washington Square and worldwide on Kitsun√©.

Producer Jimmy Giannopoulos (Lolawolf, Reputante) and vocalist Penn Badgley, neighborhood friends for years in New York, waited patiently for a sound to manifest beyond their bond based upon an odd pop aesthetic. Bassist Darren Will (Rathborne) was always orbiting, always an obvious partner when the time came. The three finally decided to hole up in a little Bungalow in East LA to record for eight days without anything written, without expectation. Seeking a microphone, they found in the neighborhood one-time-Brooklynite and New Zealand ex-pat Simon Oscroft, who proved to be the guitarist they weren't looking for. The spontaneous quartet recorded five songs in five days before taking a breath to see they had, in fact, started a band. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/MOTHXR">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
