ANNIHILATED was formed by guitarists Eric Matranga and Robert Fimbres in 2008, shortly after the breakup of the L.A. death metal band EXCRETION. They began to create songs with a sense of purpose as an outlet for their vital message to promote rational thinking and freely question what's being told to us through the press and new media outlets.

In 2012, drummer Scott Fuller (ABYSMAL DAWN) joined the group with the same values and ideologies. Helping to succeed their musical purpose, he added a new dimension of percussive flavor and syncopation to the music. Shortly after, they recruited Martin Rygiel (ex-DECAPITATED) to lay down the bass tracks on their EP, "Injected". Martin's thunderous bass attacks and vast knowledge of music added the aggression and solid foundation the group was hoping for. We're here to exploit the monstrosities of our world, give realistic views of deceit the way it needs to be told, very loud, very powerfully, and in your fucking face. We hope to spread a message to everyone out there so we can take off our shackles and start to live again.
