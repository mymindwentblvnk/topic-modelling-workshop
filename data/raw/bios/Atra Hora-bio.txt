"Atra Hora" (lat.   dark hour ) was formed in the summer of 2006. By the September the band was joined by: Xul   guitar, Ashkael   vocal, keys, Rodomag   guitar, Leon   bass, Genrih   drums. The same year the band started playing concerts touring, telling the listeners the story of sickeningly beautiful reversal of human life, urging them to take a glance upon rotten morals of a differently viewed surrounding world.
 
The band lyrics takes its source from the motives of death, chaos, war, philosophy and mysticism. 
The concerting repertoire includes cover songs of the many of Death Metal Ð¸ Black Metal bands. 

"The ideology we adhere to is quite unordinary, and we will never be led astray or driven out of from the path trodden and intended whatever are the filthy external circumstances tempting to put out the flame of dark creativity. We oppose the established morals, to everything that had so far been injected into the brain of an utterly corrupt society. We sail against the current and we care not of however fast this current is in some places. We are not intending to give up. The shadow of a Black Art Citadel is descending slowly onto the Earth. The grey fog bearing the stench of multitudes of human corpses creeps into every single bit of the heart, it overwhelms the brain. Time is coming  The dark time  Atra Hora!"
