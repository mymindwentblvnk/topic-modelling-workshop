1) CHATEAU is a German band, and their CD ‘Psychotic symphony’ was mastered at the famous Morrisound Studios in Florida, USA (SAVATAGE), so basically we are dealing here with something very professional. Happily also the music is very impressive, because the Melodic (Progressive) Metal of CHATEAU is of a very high level. Their lead singer Eric Weise has a fantastic high pitched voice (like a cross between JAMES LABRIE and GEOFF TATE, although not always at the same high level as those legendary singers), and some of the 10 songs on the CD sound very sensational as well. The band sounds like a mix between AXXIS, EDGUY and AT VANCE, with also a lot of 80s US Power/ProgMetal influences, which brings sometimes similarities to CRIMSON GLORY and QUEENSRYCHE in their very early days. Uptempo melodic heavy rock/metalsongs like “The dragon’s heart”, “Psychotic symphony”, “No friend of mine” and “Free to be me” are all sounding very good. This is a CD, which easily stands out between the majority of other releases in the Prog/Power Metal genre.
