In 2005 the musicians Rafael (ex-Future Hope) and Eduardo Clark (ex-A Sorrowful Dream, ex-Future Hope) had the idea to unite diverse sounds and characteristics of several metal genres, from heavy/hard to death/thrash/black metal, without losing the heaviness and attitude of the good 80’s metal. This idea was conceived under the name of UNMAKER.

After some rehearsals and tests the line-up was completed, with Marcelo Zabka (ex-Future Hope), Ariel (ex-Carniça, ex-Proof) and Diego. A few months later they made their first shows, playing in festivals like Gates Of Metal and Rock Metal Force.

In 2006 Unmaker recorded their first EP, entitled Rape Reality, where are all these different "metallic" influences are presented in the form of a death/thrash metal, visually and musically agressive, without any commitment with styles and labels.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/UNMAKER">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
