Originally, the band used to be named as SARAM SCIVIT. Years later, they reduced their name into the well known SARAM.
SARAM's first demo 'Sinners' shows a Black Doom Metal style that contrasts with the Black Thrash Metal music they perform in their second demo 'Metal Mayhem Genocide'. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Saram">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
