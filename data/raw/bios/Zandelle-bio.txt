Zandelle is a power metal band from New York formed in 1996. Zandelle successfully bridges the gap between epic US Metal and European Melodic Metal.  Fans of Blind Guardian, Jag Panzer, Warlord, Iron Maiden or Hammerfall may experience exactly those special moments they have been missing in the last releases of their faves.  A must for every fan of sophisticated Metal!

In 2009 they signed a deal with Pure Steel Records of Germany to release thier 4th studio album "Flames of Rage" on 5th June. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Zandelle">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
