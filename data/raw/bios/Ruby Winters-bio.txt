Ruby Winters (January 18, 1942 â€“ August 7, 2016) was an American soul singer whose records made the singles charts in both the US and UK in the 1960s and 1970s.

Winters was born in Kentucky and raised in Cincinnati, Ohio. She had her first minor hit in 1967, a duet with pop singer Johnny Thunder on the song "Make Love To Me", which had previously been a hit in 1954 for Jo Stafford. Recording on the Diamond label, she had several further minor hits in the US in the late 1960s and early 1970s, including "I Don't Want To Cry", "Guess Who" and her cover of the Dick Glasser standard, "I Will". Just as her US chart career was ending, her version of "I Will" became an unexpected hit in Britain on the independent Creole label, where it rose to no. 4 on the UK singles chart in late 1977. She followed up its success in Britain with several more hits, "Come to Me", "I Won't Mention It Again" and "Baby Lay Down".
