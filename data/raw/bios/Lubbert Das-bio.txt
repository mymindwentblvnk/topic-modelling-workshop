Black Metal from Nijmegen, the Netherlands.

The bandname is derived from a painting by Hieronymus Bosch called "Cutting the Stone", with the inscription:

Meester snyt die keye ras
Myne name Is Lubbert Das

(in English: "Master, cut away the stone
my name is Lubbert Das"). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lubbert+Das">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
