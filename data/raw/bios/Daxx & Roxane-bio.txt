Daxx & Roxane are a 4 piece rock'n' roll band originating from Switzerland, now based in London. With Mötley Crüe, Deep Purple and AC/DC listed as their key influences. UK based rockers Daxx & Roxane consists of lead vocalist / bassist Cedric Pfister, lead guitarist Cal Wymann, drummer Luca Senaldi and rhythm guitarist Simon Golaz.

Their commitment to writing songs with killer riffs that grab you and refuse to let go, and huge chorus hooks that mark them as instant classics, is reflected in their highly praised debut album, ‘Ticket to Rock’. Their second studio album, rightfully self-titled ‘Daxx & Roxane’, showed the world they have what it takes to continue on the right tracks. Released in the middle of the world’s lockdown, it ended up on many shelves around the globe, from the UK to Japan, from Australia to the USA. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Daxx+&+Roxane">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
