Factory Floor is a British electro duo consisting of Gabriel Gurnsey and Nik Colk Void.

The band was formed in 2008 London, UK as a post-punk inspired foursome with a live drummer. This early sound can be heard on their 2009 debut (mini) album "Talking on Cliffs". By 2011 the band, now a trio, had made a stylistic change to sequencer-based techno and electro, and had signed to DFA. Between their eponymous 3rd album in 2013 and the 2016 follow-up "25 25",  Dominic Butler left the group to form Bronze Teeth.
