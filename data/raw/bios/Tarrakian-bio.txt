Four-piece metal band from San Francisco, CA which have taken their name from the cult fantasy animation movie Heavy Metal, based out of the cult fantasy magazine of the same name which featured fantasy & comic book artists and short stories in the comic book/graphic novel format. The sexy, mystical, scantily & scythe clad heroine is from a long but very limited line of warriors known as TARRAKIAN'S. Not only do they have a female front-member like that of the on-going Heavy Metal sagas but their doom & epic filled rhythms and crushing riffs are also characteristic of Tolkien-like Middle-Earth where mystical powers & warrior weaponry ruled each day of this battle-filled saga. The powerful drone-like riffs reminiscent of Sabbath may bring one a clearer picture of why guitarists are said to wield axes. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tarrakian">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
