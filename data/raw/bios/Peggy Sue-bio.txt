3) A country music singer-songwriter (aka Peggy Sue Webb, born 24 Mar 1947, in Butcher Holler, KY, USA), who had brief success, in the late 60s. She is a sister of, two popular country performers, Loretta Lynn & Crystal Gayle.

She moved to Indiana  at the age of 12 due to her father's illness. She then began performing with her sisters in Indiana, and then became a featured act in Lynn's early shows. Sue helped write a few of Lynn's compositions, including "Don't Come Home A' Drinkin' (With Lovin' on Your Mind)." In 1969, she signed with Decca Records and released her debut single, "I'm Dynamite," which went into the Country Top 30. That year, she released an album of the same name, and the second single from that album titled, "I'm Gettin' Tired of Babyin' You" also reached the Top 30. After Sue had a hit with her most successful single, "All-American Husband," she left Decca Records after releasing two albums. She recorded two albums in the 70s for two small labels.

After 1970, she didn't appear on the Billboard country charts until 1980, where she had a string of minor hits off of her second husband, Sonny Wright's, label Doorknob. After 1983, her success declined and she began performing as a background singer and designing stage costumes for her sister, Crystal Gayle. She continues to perform today, occasionally with her two sisters. She had a daughter named Doyletta, but she was murdered by her daughter's then-husband. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Peggy+Sue">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
