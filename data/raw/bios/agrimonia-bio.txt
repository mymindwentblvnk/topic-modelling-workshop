Agrimonia is a unique quintet hailing from Gothenburg, Sweden. The band blends a variety of genres to create a truly unique sound and style; including sludge, crust, black metal, post-metal and doom metal. Their mixture of genres is one thing that helps them to stand out, and another is some of the musicians who comprise its roster. Agrimonia has four full-length releases under its belt.

Comprising the best of sludge, crust, and non-metal genres, the band crafts beautiful, epic, sweeping compositions that leave the listener rooted firmly to the spot; fully in awe and appreciation of the gorgeous sounds tickling their eardrums. Harsh vocals, keyboards, blast beats, simple grooves, beautiful soundscapes; they have it all, and the members that comprise Agrimonia are the vehicles that give their masterful work a voice.

Agrimoniaâ€™s songwriting skills seem to have increased massively since their last effort. The tempo changes at appropriate moments, parts never drag on for too long and with the incorporation of some quieter parts and even piano at a point in time.
