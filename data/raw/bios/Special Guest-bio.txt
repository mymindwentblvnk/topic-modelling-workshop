1.) Special Guest is a pop punk band from Ft. Worth, TX.

2.) Special Guest is Providence College's only all-male a cappella group. Since its inception in 1996, the group has been performing on the PC campus, around Providence, and around New England for anyone willing to listen. The boys of Special Guest are notorious on Providence's campus for breaking hearts, making knees weak, and being really, really, ridiculously good looking in the black and tan. Their traditional annual performances include

Fall, Christmas, and Spring concerts; 
PCACI (Providence College A Cappella Invitational), when they invite groups from other schools to share the stage; 
Valentine's Day Song-o-Grams, a series of nights during which they embark on a campus tour, visiting YOUR dorms and delivering entertainment personally to YOU 
and many more

Special Guest records every year and releases an album about once every two years. Albums are on sale for ten bucks at shows or by email request to pcspecialguest@gmail.com. Current discography is as follows:
