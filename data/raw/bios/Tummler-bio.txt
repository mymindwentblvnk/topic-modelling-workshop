Tummler was born in June of 1996 in Champaign, Illinois. In September of 1999 Tummler recorded a three song demo which led to their first full length album "Queen To Bishop VI" in June 2000 under the legendary Frank Kozik and Man's Ruin Records. The Tummler crew remained all original until the close of 2001. Having witnessed the fall of Man's Ruin, the memories were just too painful to continue... Or, the guitar player thought living in California would be worth leaving his life's blood. Down to two members, Brad Buldak and Jay Vance began to rebuild. Enter Ryan Jerzak and Ginchy... Together with Brad and Jay, the foursome has smoothed the rough edges, discovered their strengths, and coalesced into a force to be reckoned with. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tummler">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
