Coldcast was a finnish heavy metal group founded in January 2007, in the town of Heinola. The drummer Mikko Saarela left the group in 2009, and the remaining members will record the rest of the new album. The current lineup of the group consists of Veikko Sajaniemi (lead vocals, lead/rhythm guitars), Mauri Lunkka (backing vocals, rhythm/lead guitars) and Ville Kivistö (backing vocals, bass). The new album titled 'Conviction in Stone' is coming out somewhere in 2009.

Coldcast’s style of music varies from common heavy/power metal to more progressive music, including lots of melodic and clean parts in addition to heavy metal riffing. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Coldcast">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
