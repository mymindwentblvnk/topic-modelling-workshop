Zemial was formed by multi-instrumentalist Vorskaath in Athens, Greece in 1989.

Throughout the last 20 years Zemial have stood as The Adversary to current trends and chose to operate away from the mainstream, allowing the strength of the music and their concert performances to represent them.

Zemial has changed musical direction over the years and have encompassed extreme metal as well as rock and art music experimentation as evidenced by NYKTA,  Vorskaathâ€™s most ambitious, avant-garde and technical work to date.
