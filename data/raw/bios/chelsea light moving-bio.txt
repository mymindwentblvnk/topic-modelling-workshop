Chelsea Light Moving is an experimental rock band formed in 2012 in New York City, United States. Their members are Thurston Moore (guitar, vocals), Keith Wood (guitar), Samara Lubelski (bass guitar) and John Moloney (drums).

After sitting in the orgone box planted in Burroughs' back yard of Lawrence, Kansas in the midpoint of the 1990s, Thurston Moore came to the realization that at some point he'd need to form a band that played Burroughs Rock. This is the sound of Wild Boys looking to jack hypos of core passion into their veins. Boy on boy. Girl on girl. Start there. It's not even music - it's an amphetamine sonnet for the on-the-loose lovers of the world.
