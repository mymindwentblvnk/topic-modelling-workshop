Universally referred to as a white family folk group – because that’s how they started out – the Dalton Boys signed to Motown for one single in 1965, after a few line-up changes, by which time their sound had evolved away from folk and towards Merseybeat rock-pop. Although their one and only Motown single apparently picked up some airplay around Detroit, national audiences remained unimpressed and the Boys left the label soon afterwards; the band broke up, although according to Graham Betts’ superb Motown Encyclopedia, some of the members later moved to California and reunited as Colours, where their story intersects with many other prominent branches of the Sixties psychedelic rock family tree. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Dalton+Boys">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
