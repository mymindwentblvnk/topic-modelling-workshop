Zud is a metal band from Portland, Maine (USA). 

The word "zud" is Mongolian, roughly translating to english as: a particularly snowy and cold winter, one in which many livestock animals are killed by the cold. 

There is also a band from Hungary of the same name. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/zud">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
