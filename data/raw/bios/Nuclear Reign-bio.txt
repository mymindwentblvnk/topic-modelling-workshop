4 piece thrash metal outfit Nuclear Reign was formed in February of 2006 by Lorcan Murray (Vocals and guitars) and Josh Howe (guitars). The original line-up was short lived, when after just months of rehearsing, differences (both musical and personal) between band members resulted in the loss of a drummer and bassist. It wasnt long before Simon Maples (Ex - A Distant Sun) was recruited on drums and Al Giles on bass. After rehearsing a short set the band began gigging steadily, landing some impressive support slots including '3 Inches of Blood' and 'Blitzkrieg' among others. In May of 2007 a 5 track demo entitled "Mutually Assured Destruction" was released. However, the band suffered yet another set back when bassist Al Giles decided to leave due to personal reasons. One more line-up change ensued. Paul Brocklebank was brought in on guitars and Lorcan switched to bass. The Band soon returned for a final string on the gigging circuit until its disband in November 2008. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nuclear+Reign">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
