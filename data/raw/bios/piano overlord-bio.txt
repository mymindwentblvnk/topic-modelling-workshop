A side project of producer Scott Herren, better known as Prefuse 73, the Piano Overlord project represents two years of his work with a specific sound.  Pianos, wurlitzers, rhodes, and other keyboards became the canvas for a more mellow, readily accessible sound than the sample friendly and heavily edited sound of Prefuse 73.  The result is a mellow, meditative, beautiful mix of warm keyboard sounds and light percussions.

The artist's own very candid and interesting explanation of the music, including the circumstances leading to its creation, can be found on his personal website. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Piano+Overlord">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
