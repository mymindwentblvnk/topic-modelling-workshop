The Gothic Archies is the Gothic rock-bubblegum pop band of celebrated songwriter Stephin Merritt, also of The Magnetic Fields, The 6ths, and Future Bible Heroes. Merritt is the only member although he hopes to acquire more soon.

What makes this band different from The Magnetic Fields is that any glimmer of hope is absolutely extinguished.
