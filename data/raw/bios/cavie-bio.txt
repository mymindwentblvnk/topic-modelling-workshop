Born and raised in Compton, producer/rapper Caviar (aka Cavie) on the mic and behind the scenes: Cavie's inspiration dates back to '88 when his buddy DJ Train came back after touring with Eazy-E. DJ Train had more money than Caviar had ever seen, enough to persuade him to change his hustle from the streets to the rap game. In the early days, you could find Cavie working with west coast legends like Above the Law and DOC... and opening up for Westside Connection, Bone Thugs-N-Harmony and E40. In the ninetees, Cavie and close friend Staino formed the West Coast Goon Squad. Years later, he signed a deal with Black Ground Records and worked with Aaliyah, Tank, Toni Braxton and Timbaland (who he also had his first single with, "Bouncin' Down the Boulevard"). In 2001, he produced and rapped in the single for the Million Family March soundtrack also featuring Kam, Snoop Dogg, Fat Joe, Rage, Mack 10, Sincere and Drag-On with a special cameo by Louis Farrakhan <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/cavie">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
