Koreisch are a band from Sheffield, UK. They play a unique mix of Grindcore, Doom Metal, Industrial Metal and experimental noise to to form their own never-heard-before never-heard-again sound. Formed in the late 1990s they rehearsed and toured locally until they collapsed. Their only release was "This Decaying Schizophrenic Christ Complex" in 1999 before they split up. They reformed in 2004 to re-release their debut and only record. The re-released was mastered by Scot Hull (Agoraphobic Nosebleed, Pig Destroyer, Anal Cunt, Japanese Torture Comedy Hour) and released by Calculated Risk Records. The Band was then expected to release a new record in 2005, however they disappeared from all contact and were never heard or seen again.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Koreisch">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
