Born in New York City, December Child fell in love with music at an early age.  As a kid, he often delighted in taking songs from the radio and remixing them in his head, a habit that developed into a desire to produce.  After his college roommate, Dirty Human, taught him how to use music production software FL Studio (called Fruity Loops at the time), December Child never looked back.

His musical influences include underground Hip-Hop, 80s radio classics, House, Ambient, and movie and video game scores.  A natural dancer, his love of B-Boying and Housing subtly influence his familiar beat selection. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/December+Child">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
