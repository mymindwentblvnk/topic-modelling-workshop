Young Lean is best known in Australia as hype-man to emcee Louie Knuxx, a fact that is about to change with the release of his debut EP, Worth The Wax. While Louie has quickly gained a solid following for his husky drawl and gritty imagery, in contrast, Young Lean's music is distinguished by his crystal clear flow and positive outlook.

The 6-track EP features the aforementioned Mr Knuxx, along with Grips & Tonic band mate JJ Peters. Young Lean featured heavily on both of Grips' highly successful releases, and brings his intense energy to their live sets. It's this tireless stage presence that has helped the New Zealand emcee hold his own on half a dozen Australian tours, supporting some of the biggest names in hardcore and hip hop: Necro, Amity Affliction, Ghost inside and Deez Nuts.

The EP also features vocals from another New Zealand ex-pat Tourettes, and Young Heretics. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Young+Lean">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
