VORACIOUS GANGRENE started in 1998 when Pat (lead guitar) and Stef (drums) met together at a local metal radio show. After several months of talks about the project and some excitingly violent rehearsals, Jessy (rhythm guitar), Steph (vocals, ex-Disabled) and Alain (bass) joined the band to work on the first skull crushing tracks.
The first 4 tracks MCD “Hooked to Death” was self-released in 1999 and had a very good feedback from the international underground scene.

The aim of VORACIOUS GANGRENE was to play heavier, faster intense brutal death metal.

During the year 2000, Barby and Guillaume joined the band to the bass and the vocals respectively. With the new coming Manu (rhythm guitar) during 2001, the "Vorace Gang” was completed and it was a step toward a new level of musical violence and musicianship. An MCD was self-recorded at our own studios Bud Records to promote the band.

On stage, the powerful songs with also melodic touch transformed the live performances into an intense moment for the band and the metalheads present to the show.

Late in 2003, due to some personal difficulties the band decided to split up and announced it while playing a last local show, heading on a local date with VADER.
Crowd and fans highly appreciated the show and were disappointed about this ending but never as the Vorace Gang himself.

Most of the songs were never recorded as VORACIOUS GANGRENE was mostly a live band so you will find here some rehearsals and live sounds for the fans to remember and for everyone else to have a taste of this voraciously gangrened intense death metal music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Voracious+Gangrene">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
