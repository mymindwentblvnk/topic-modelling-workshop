The wrathful flame of Gambanteinn was born in the heart of Þjazi during the spring 2010. The original idea of the band was to make homage to the true black, death, thrash and heavy metal-music. Very soon it came clear that the actual purpose of Gambanteinn was to create something far more personal and meaningful. The call was heard from the darkness, and beyond the false light of the bastard æsir-gods the path of true wisdom was shown by the black runes and by the will of Loki. With this revelation in Þjazi’s mind, he started to create arts that would praise the gods of the beyond and the below, and the inevitable doom of Cosmos; Ragna Røk.

Almost three years went by, as Þjazi was studying the wisdom and the knowledge of the thursian-race. And at the same time, composing and writing the music that would soon emerge as the first release of his one-man-band Gambanteinn. Five songs were created, and during the year 2013 recorded, to celebrate the darkness and the mysteries of the Night-side. The first demo-ep of Gambanteinn contained five songs; two written in English and three in Finnish. The demo-ep was titled “Nielevä Pimeys”, which would be translated as “The Darkness that Devours” and it was released in January 23, 2014. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gambanteinn">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
