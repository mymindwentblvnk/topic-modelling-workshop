2: no idea who the other bands are.


this is the first bulwarks bio:
Bulwark is the sum of an awkward love triangle between three fat, black lesbians with sideburns and cowboy hats while a jungle dwelling midget fights somebody's dad over the results of a pokemom battle that occured back in '94 during an alternate reality where Eugene Levy murdered and ate Robert Downy Jr while watching re-runs of Three's A Company and ironing his favourite flannel shirt. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bulwark">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
