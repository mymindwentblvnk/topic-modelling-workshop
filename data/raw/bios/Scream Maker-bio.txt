Scream Maker – a Polish heavy metal band famous for cooperation with, inter alia, Jordan Rudess (Dream Theater) and Wojciech Hoffmann (Turbo) and for its presence in the Chinese music market (two tours, one official release). Scream Maker is considered to be one of the brightest hopes of Polish metal music scene. Their music is oldschool but with a modern edge, smart lyrics and interesting melodies – and it’s really working well live! They always get a warm welcome and that probably explains why a band that’s only five years old (SM’s been stablished in 2010) managed to play over 200 gigs, opening for bands like Primal Fear, Turbo, Tim Ripper Owens, Blaze Bayley, Paul Di’Anno and Tarja Turunen. Scream Maker released two albums: „We Are Not The Same” EP and „Livin’ in the Past” CD (Perris Records). Now after successfully finishing the largest metal crowdfunding project in Poland band is going to record a totally new album in cooperation with famous Italian producer and musician Alessandro Del Vecchio (working with people from Black Sabbath, Deep Purple or Journey). Scream Maker is also known for organizing Doładowanie Fest, a festival promoting young bands, or 2 editions of „King of Rock and Roll” show – dedicated to Ronnie James Dio. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Scream+Maker">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
