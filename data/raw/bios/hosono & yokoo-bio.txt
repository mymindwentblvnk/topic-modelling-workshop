"Cochin Moon," is an electronic music soundtrack to the non-existent film, written by Yellow Magic Orchestra member Haruomi Hosono (細野晴臣). The album is co-credited to Tadanori Yokoo (横尾忠則), creator of the Bollywood-style cover art, though he seemingly neither wrote any of the music nor performed on it. Along with Shuka Nishihara and fellow YMO members Ryuichi Sakamoto and Hideki Matsutake, Hosono recorded this album after a trip to India. It combines the sounds of the region with elements of exotica and industrial music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hosono+&+Yokoo">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
