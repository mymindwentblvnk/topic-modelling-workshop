1: Theo is the alias of multi-instrumentalist Sam Knight, from Worcester, UK. Taut, chugging guitar loops layer up with frenetic tapping patterns that interweave in spiralling complexity before near sub-atomically precise, powerhouse drumming clatters and builds each song into juggernaut of riffs and rhythms. To achieve something like this recorded is one thing, but to see Theo perform live is quite another as each song blurs into the next and the dazzling guitar and drum acrobatics leave jaws sagging on the faces of all who bear witness to the talent on offer. He released his first EP Order, Echo in 2007, and has released several more since. (see also: Theo (UK).
