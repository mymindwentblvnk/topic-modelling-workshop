Hellhunter is a Bay Area blackened thrash outfit made up of seasoned
metal veterans from the San Francisco metal scene.  Formed in 2004,
the band was created by front man Bruce Leevil and guitarist Godgore
(aka Lawrence Of Carpathia).  Their mission is to bring metal back to
it's roots and create a relentless style reminiscent of the NWOBHM era
bands like Tank and Satan, as well as the heavier thrash sounds of
old Celtic Frost, Baloff era Exodus, and early Dr Know.  The band
recruited ex-Heathen/Laaz Rockit/Mordred/Mercenary axe wizard Sven
Soderlund (aka The Burzurkur) to the line up.  Soderlund's influence
has created a refined, contrasting edge to their satanic, barbaric
song writing.  Rounding off the line up is bass player, the Satanik
Grizzly (aka Patches Bob) as well as skin pounder Skulldozer, (aka
Gary Smith ex-Earwigz). 

The band has release a 5 song demo and is available at their myspace page:
