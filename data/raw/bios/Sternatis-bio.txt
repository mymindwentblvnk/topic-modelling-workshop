Extremely secret Blazebirth Hall project that members of the circle try to hide. Reason for this is Kaldrad and Ulv recorded this album and then fell out with the main person behind the band (Moroth aka Wolffeuer). Since the rift Blazebirth Hall has denied this band as part of the circle.

Thus far, Sternatis has only recorded one demo, titled "Смерчем воли тараня" ("Ramming with Maelstorm of Will in English) in 2000. The lineup on this demo was:

Moroth - Vocals, Guitars, Songwriting, Lyrics
Kaldrad - Bass
Ransverdi - Drums
Ulv - Guitars on track 5
Njard - Clean vocals on track 5

A new album was announced by Moroth in 2017, but has not been released yet. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sternatis">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
