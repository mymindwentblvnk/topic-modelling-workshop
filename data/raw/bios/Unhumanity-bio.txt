Unhumanity is a death metal band formed in Plovdiv, Bulgaria in the fall of 2008 by Nikola (bass) and Spazz (guitar). Soon after Ivan (guitar) and Peter (vocals) joined them and the band started to write songs and to search for appropriate drummer. In the summer of 2009 after trying several drummers Eduard (drums) joined the band and the lineup is finally completed. In the beginning of 2010 Unhumanity was ready to enter the studio and after months of hard work in January 2011 their self-titled debut EP Unhumanity was released and the band decided to put it on Internet for free. In 2012 Nikola left the band for personal reasons and got replaced by Ico. In 2013 three songs from their newest material are included in Rebirth the Metal Productions's 3-way split Triple Underground Devastation along with Defilement and Deformed Cadaver. At the moment Unhumanity are writing songs for their full-length release.
