In the summer of -04, what was to become Corrosive Carcass, was formed, with the simple intention of playing metal independent of subgenres. As time passed the band became more serious and the style was constantly changing. They where jumping back and forth between styles, trying to find what was right for the band and after failed attempts at compromises they decided to try Death Metal again. Jon joined the band in early -07 wich was yet again a new start, as they got rid of all material from before that time and started preparing for playing live. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Corrosive+Carcass">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
