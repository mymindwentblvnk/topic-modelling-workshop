Revelance is doomed to become one of the leaders of russian metal scene. Combining sympho black metal, marvellous elements of death metal with truly great voice of the leader of the band Aleksander Osipov, Revelance appeared on russian undeground metal scene as a comet indeed, and at once lighted hearts of all the metal-fans of former USSR. "Since our hearts are burning with love, no one could put them out"! It must be mentioned that Revelance possesses wonderful guitarists, really crackjacks, and i guess only a few guitarist in Russia could stand comparison with them. 
The genuine gem of the band is surely vocals! Its so different that sometimes one could doubt whether there is only one man on the vocals in the band! Aleksander is a master of all the vocal styles, yet his favourite one is growling.

The songs of Revelance mostly concern the theme of revealing the true nature of a man, which as usual is connected with the thoughts of death, of crime... Osipov insists that "everyone has something to conceal from others, has his own inner dark world, and even a glance of it could terrify...", and thats why he picked out this theme as a leading motive of his creative work. By perceiving that dark side of human nature Aleksander get along on the way of progress.

For the time being Revelance is one the most perspective metal bands in Russia, and this thesis can be confirmed by the fact, that recently Revelance played with 69 Eyes! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Revelance">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
