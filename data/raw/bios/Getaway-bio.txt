We are Getaway. We are a three piece band and we've invented a new fucking genre. It's called Riff Rock. If you want to know what Riff Rock sounds like buy a Black Keys album. And listen to it. If you like that, have a chew on the weighty stuff by Band of Skulls. Still with us? Give The White Stripes a tickle. 

At this point, and not a moment sooner, you may begin to consider listening to us. Getaway. And our new genre. Riff Rock. Which does sound a lot like some old genres, but chemically speaking, isn't.

We gig, but not a lot. We record, but not a lot. And we used to rehearse. This has had no negative impact on the glory and holiness of our performances. They are still glorious. And holy. 

Mel played without a shirt once. He has the torso of a bison.
