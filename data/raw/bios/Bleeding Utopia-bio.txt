Started as a side project in 2003 by Andreas Moren(Dead Awaken, ex Astral Carneval) and Erik Stenström(ex Soulbreach). 
BU did some small recordings and a few live gigs…
…but in the summer of 2009 Andreas decided to take it further,
To take it from a project to a 110% band.
He asked his old friend and drummer Lawrence Dinamarca
(ex Astral Carneval, Loch Vostok), Henrik Wenngren (ex Vicious, ex Skyfire),
David Ahlén (ex The Enthalled, ex Platina, Hermafroditerna) to join to band.

BU started to rehears as crazy and made song after song after song.

In the spring of 2010 Joakim Bergros (ex The Masses, Neb___üla) joined as a second guitarist. 
BU booked a couple of gigs and recorded a 4 song promo, you can listen to 4
songs on Myspace and Spotify.
