Desoulment is an American Metal band from the United States.

During the summer of 2010, Tom Bandelow and Matt Kruger decided it was time to make a serious commitment to put out a demo of their material. The two of them, lifelong friends, had collaborated on various band projects over the years. 

Desoulment's music contributes to the emotional impact that metal heads enjoy. Their music evokes passion, angst, and victory in tenacious melodies through their renditions of Black, Death, and Thrash metal.
