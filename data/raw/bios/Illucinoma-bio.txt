Illucinoma is a metalband from Amsterdam, The Netherlands, which consists of five members. The music has elements of trash metal as well as progressive metal and is comparable with bands like Meshuggah, Mastodon and Lamb of God.

Illucinoma was founded in 2010 by Joe Tal (guitar) and Dave Masciari (vocals). After graduating from the conservatory, Tal wanted to start his own metalband.

Masciari and Tal had already worked together from 2005 to 2006 in the alternative project Ampliground. Masciari then had already recorded a solo album under the name Ampliground. Drummer Phillipp Moser (currently in Cilice), guitarist Avi Mishali and bassist Assa Raviv completed the formation. Raviv left Ampliground and was replaced by Jack Moxham. After a couple of shows and the release of an EP, Ampliground called it quits in late 2006.

Ampliground got a fresh start in 2009. Because of a strong change in musical direction, the name later was changed to Illucinoma. Drummer Jasper Smit (formerly in Apocrypha) and guitarist Miguel Heijnen joined Illucinoma in April 2010. In October Masciari was replaced by vocalist Joram Bronwasser (formerly in Conteched). Alex Panov replaced Miguel Heijnen in March 2011.

Although hailing from Amsterdam, Illucinoma is an international project with members from The Netherlands, Israel, UK and Russia. Former members are from Italy, Belgium and Israel.

In March 2011, Illucinoma released an EP with three songs. In June, Illucinoma was asked to play the Euroblast festival in Germany. The band is currently working ont their second EP.
