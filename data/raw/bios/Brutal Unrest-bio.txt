Brutal Unrest was formed in the summer of 2002 with the intention of playing brutal Death Metal.

After creation of several songs and some further concerts the time was right to record the first demo-album: "No Light No Hope Eternal" was released in early 2006. Following this, Brutal Unrest continued to impress audiences by their live appearances, which always gathered a great response.

In 2009 Brutal Unrest signed a deal with Aural Attack Productions and entered the Sounds of Steel Studio to record their second album "Hellcatraz", which has been released on November 6th, 2009. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Brutal+Unrest">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
