Raised on Influential Stories, Desmond "Dessy" Hinds took stories into his own hands and turned them in to exhilarating Rhymes. Growing up in the 90' Era Listening to R&B songs, surprisingly Hinds came out of the sixth grade with what he calls "a special Gift" of Rapping exceptionally. His Skill has been branched off from his amazing ability to Write, Clarity of Speaking profoundly, and his Creati...ve form of literary art. Blending it all in to Music and taking in the seriousness of documenting Wordplay and other Rapping techniques in his Rhyming, Hinds became able to separate his Subject Matters to Dish Out an Extravagant Use of Story Telling. Beginning to become very meticulous dealing with his vocabulary, the Musician boasted on Intelligence in witty and clever forms through Flow, and a Self-made style. By the age of 17, he began to make more Serious Musical Attributes, including working on his Debut Mixtape "The Masterpiece" and constantly Performing in NYC, trying to make a name for himself in Hip Hop Music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dessy+Hinds">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
