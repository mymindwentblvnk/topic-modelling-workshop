Leiden is a metal band from Toulouse in France.

The group operates in a very subtle style, mixing very dark moods, guttural vocals and husky female voice and melodic air. Antagonist emotions and contrasts that result are the strength of their music.

The group then prepares his first album due out in 2003 Empty and will lead eventually to a national tour. Duality appears in 2005, an album far more nuanced and successful, happily combining the many influences of the group (for this album, Matt, the drummer, got the keyboard for the song "Chimera"). After this album, Leiden starts here as a national tour. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Leiden">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
