1)L.A.C.K. was a Swedish rap/rock group that consisted of five guys hailing from the small town of Sundsvall in the northern part of the country. With three musicians from the hardrock/metal genre and two vocalists from the hip-hop genre L.A.C.K was an interesting mixture of groovy rock and emotionally charged (but yet conscious and witty) rap.

The group was founded in 2007 but the level of experience was off the charts due to connections to other Swedish groups such as the rockers in Roulette and the rappers in Tungviktarna (aka The Heavy Weights). Unfortunately their time in the lime light became a little too short when some of the members, in mid-2009, decided to prioritize other things in their lives.
