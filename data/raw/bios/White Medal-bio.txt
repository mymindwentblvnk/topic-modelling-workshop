UK Black Metal from George "Mutant Ape" Proctor.

Tha's heard't howl ut wolf
Down't Agbrigg way
Tha knows t'beast in't wood theer
An up on't moor, she roams theer an all
Shut thus flep an she'll not hear thee
Step'd on't branch, th wolf step'd o'er mardy
Tha's stark legs move ar'a pace
But tha's too lame t'beat her

Alone an thee hear't wolf cry;
Agbrigg!

Threap an she'll bite thee no mistake
Thoil thus burden an break fert wood
Through unkerd wood an moor-fog
Laiking bairn in't wood an thus blood curdles
She's on't way tha shout but he's gut torn
Yer off before his heart stops, beast in'tow
Dassent breathe in nor out and hide by't rock
Then that old howl and tha drops down dead

Alone again, tha'll hear't wolf cry,
Agbrigg! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/White+Medal">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
