There are 5 groups named The Regime:

1. The Regime (a.k.a. The Smoke-A-Lot Regime or Regime Dragon Gang) are a gangsta rap group created by rapper Yukmouth of The Luniz in 1997 and originally included fellow rappers Tech N9ne, Phats Bossi, Madmax, Poppa LQ, and Govnormatic. Not long after the original formation, rappers Gonzoe of rap group Kausion and Lil' Ke also joined. The group was named as a result of old Hitler movies viewed by Yukmouth in which Hitler's army was referred to as "The Regime" or "The Hitler Regime". The logo for the group is a silhouette of a dragon inspired by Yukmouth's love of dragons and old Bruce Lee movies. The dragon logo also doubles as the logo for Yukmouth's label Smoke-A-Lot Records, which incidentally, The Regime are currently signed to as a group. The Regime is unique when it comes to rap groups in that the members are from different states and cities around the U.S. yet come together to make music and money. Besides guest appearances on numerous Yukmouth related projects, the group has released three acclaimed mixtapes entitled "All Out War Volume. 1", "All Out War Volume. 2" and "All Out War Volume. 3" and plan to release their debut album Regime Dragon Gang.
