Sons of Kyuss was the original name of the stoner rock group Kyuss. They released this eponymous recording in 1990 before changing their name to Kyuss that same year. The album was originally released as a limited edition clear vinyl and is extremely rare in its original form. A CD version was officially released in 2000, but is also very rare. Their follow-up album Wretch released the next year featured several new versions of songs from this album, as well as two taken directly from the original, "Deadly Kiss" and "Black Widow". The band continued to release albums until they went on indefinite hiatus in October 1995. This recording is considered to be the debut album by Kyuss. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/sons+of+kyuss">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
