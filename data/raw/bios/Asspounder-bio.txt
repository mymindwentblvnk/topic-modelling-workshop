Asspounder was formed in 98 as one of the first extreme music groups in the area. Introducing, participating and influencing a wave of Salem and Northwestern Black Metal.
As members came and went Guitarist (Lord Malevolence) remains principle song writer from inception. However many Demos where recorded, the Demonic Realm Demo/mini cd. Remains most popular and most widely known. It is this era that people think of Asspounder Most Fondly.
However Due to legal reasons Asspounder was forced to change their name in 2005. This came as a shocking blow to the band to say the least. This combined with the departure of our long time friend and bassist Mold Feast, (due to living distances. ) Created a pause in development of music and touring. Instead of just letting Asspounder fade into nothing the remaining members have created a new known as Altar Of Thrond. Note: This is not just a name change but an entire different entity. This would also explain why Asspounder has done nothing since November 2005. We have been writing all new material and gathering up what we need for our new project. We look forward to showcasing our new band and would hope that our old fans find the new project as engaging and even more appealing. We look forward to getting in the studio soon and presenting the public with a cd. As of now until further notice Asspounder is officially on Hiatus. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Asspounder">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
