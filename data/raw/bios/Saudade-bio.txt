There are 5 artists named Saudade:

1. Saudade is Christopher Cantino (CA) and Jason Gray (VT).  The two met while employed at a psychiatric residential treatment facility and hospital.  The release of their second record, "Lookouts' Journal" on ARRCO establishes the duo as one of the most intelligent and progressive acts of the year with their fresh, sound-tracky take on pop ambient/haunt music.

2. A black metal band from London, Ontario.

3. Saudade is Carlos Ricardo López Carrasco (Oaxaca, México). 25 year old sound artist and electronic musician signed at MYRDAL. SoundLAB. But in his own words, he doesn’t declare himself as a musician or sound artist, he just manipulates library music, taking sounds from here and there, to reframe how we perceive noise and silence.

4. Saudade is a one-man project that has been the creative outlet (or maybe it is better to say "therapeutic outlet") for Todd Durrant, the owner of the electronic pop label A Different Drum. Saudade blends the sounds of modern technology with a raw, unpolished approach that gives the music and lyrics more of an authentic, human touch as opposed to an over-produced and often superficial mainstream music market.

5. Saudade is a hardcore band from Naples (IT).
