Los Angeles-based melodic Hip-Hop/R&B duo MIKNNA is cultivating what can best be described as a sonic excursion, transporting listeners to a futuristic-yet-contemporary universe as inspired by “Blade Runner” as it is Daft Punk, Frank Ocean and Michael Jackson. Comprised of producer/multi-instrumentalist Ken Nana and rapper/vocalist Mike B., MIKNNA was born out of a collective love for blurring genre lines, experimenting with retro-futuristic sounds and finding solace in nostalgia. Officially joining forces in 2016, the self-described "Hall & Oates of Hip-Hop/R&B" have since discovered their strengths as like-minded collaborators, going on to release their introductory EP, 50/50 (Side A), after experiencing early success through Spotify’s Fresh Finds playlist. In 2017, the duo embarked on their first headlining US and European tour, honing their live performance while each lent their respective talents as songwriters/producers to other acts, including the Anderson .Paak-fronted group, the Free Nationals, as well as Terrace Martin, Far East Movement and Big K.R.I.T. Their vintage, mood ring aesthetic allows MIKNNA to create a lush, swirling soundscape, full of contemporary rap stylings, retro 80s analog production and soulful melodies, encouraging listeners to indulge in feel-good escapism and let the music take the wheel. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/MIKNNA">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
