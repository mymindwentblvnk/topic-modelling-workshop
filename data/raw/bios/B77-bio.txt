Leopold Schwaller and Luca Carbone form the project B77. By exploring their own emotions, twisted thoughts and somewhat childish desires they confront us with unconventional melodies and unclear messages, but still achieving to connect and resonate with the listener. After lancing the project with their EP “LL8” in 2017 they soon established their role in the swiss music scene, followed by singles like “panthere” and “woods”, until recently releasing the EP “Fleur” – reaching out internationally but staying loyal to their distinctive sound. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/B77">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
