Texas Metal Alliance, formed by members of North Texas' most well-known late '80s/early '90s thrash bands, originally got together to play a benefit show for former Hammerwitch bassist/vocalist Wayne Abney who suffered injuries from a motorcycle accident. At that first show, the band featured several special guests and played only covers of songs from the members' old bands. After the good crowd response, the band decided to continue and has gone on to record and release new original material.

Band members:
Bruce Corbitt - Vocals (Rigor Mortis, ex-Malignancy)
Rick Perry - Guitar (Gammacide, Puncture, ex-Warlock)
Scott Shelby - Guitar (Gammacide, Cauldron, ex-Rotting Corpse, Hammerwitch)
Alan Bovee - Bass (Gammacide)
Joe Gonzalez - Drums (Demonseed)
