The Universe is in a state of constant expansion. In billions of cosmological decades all existing matter will be torn apart atom by atom. The entire universe will be cooled, and eventually become nothing more than space dust, and then nothingness. Time will cease to be. Knowing this, a far-off, unimaginable civilization will survive off of the few remaining sources of heat. Before all mass and light die out, these advanced beings will attempt to open a door to another dimension by exploding a number of immeasurably dense sub-atomic particles of dark matter inside a dying black hole. The resulting singularity of space time will spark the Big Bang. Time will begin again. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Big+Rip">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
