We make drug rock, and play it very fucking loudly. 


In a perfect world, the Wizard Eye band biography could be nothing more than the above sentence. But the music world wants to know more, doesn't it? It needs to know histories, aspirations and influences. It has to know how many "scenester points" the band can boast and whose names it can drop. Sorry, music world, but you're just going to be a little disappointed, because Wizard Eye doesn't play those games. The technical facts about this band are there for all to see--formed in late 2007, Wizard Eye comprises four like-minded brethren whose combined experience includes almost two decades of music performance ranging up and down the East Coast of the United States at countless venues ranging from New York City's finest showcase rooms to down-and-dirty basement parties in the kudzu fields of Raleigh, NC. And, of course, it'd be incredibly easy to invoke the usual riff-rock royalty bands as musical comparisons, but if you're looking at these words, chances are pretty good you can hear the kind of sounds coming from Wizard Eye and draw your own conclusions.
