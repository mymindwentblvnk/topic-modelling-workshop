Veineliis is a Black Metal solo-project formed in Schwedt, Germany in 2002 and is led by M.v.V.

While the music of Veineliis was very minimalistic and melancholic in the beginning, style and sound became more aggressive and dirtier in 2008 to form an more individual atmosphere which can be yet hard to digest for the ordinary listener.

M.v.V. is also the sole member of Schlaflos
