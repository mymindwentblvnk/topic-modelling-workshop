Evig Hat was founded in 2011 by Satan, Taakedahl, Ishavsgrim and Nordlys. This lineup was however split up the same year due to the tragic death of Taakedahl during the Utøya attacks. There was however one test recording of one of the original songs, this later resulted in the single now known as Taakedahl. After trying and failing with several different lineups, Satan decided to record as a solo project. This quickly resulted in a short recording process of which the outcome was the debut album Misantropiens Paradoks. Allthough this was meant as a single release to manifest satans appreciation for Black Metal, the interest around the project started to grow. This resulted in rapidly releasing several albums and Eps.
After releasing four albums and two Eps Evig Hat signed a contract with Senseless Life Records. They released the albums Ikonoklassist and Waste of Hate, Waste of Flesh, Waste of Death before altering their business model from label to distribution service. This resulted in said releases being released by Evig Hats own label Bad Noise Records, where the project has since continued releasing all albums.
Throughout the growing lifespan of Evig Hat, there has been several collaborations with other artists. Likskjender (Mannepenis, Död, Ashmadia) did the vocals on the five song EP named Henrettet. Kvestardraugr (Normal Paranoia, The Pop Culture Elite, Jealous of Plato, Sirkus Vladimir) played all keys on Radbrukket and Necro Mortis (Pale Fingers) did the vocals for Ved Helvetes Port. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Evig+Hat">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
