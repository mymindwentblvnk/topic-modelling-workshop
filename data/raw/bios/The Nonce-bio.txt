The Nonce is a rap duo from Los Angeles, California that was mainly active in the mid 90s. Its members included Nouka Basetype (a.k.a. Sach) and Yusef Afloat, the latter of whom passed away. Their album World Ultimate, which featured production from EPMD member Erick Sermon, was released in 1995 and is considered an underground classic. Because it is out of print and finding a tangible copy of the album is very difficult, some consider it a collector's favorite. The song "Mix Tapes" was featured on the LA seminal underground compilation "Project Blowed"

After World Ultimate came an EP, The Sight of Things in 1998. Their sophomore full effort, Turn it Out, followed in 1999. In 2005, previously unreleased material from The Nonce was given proper issue in the form of two albums: Advanced Regression and The Right State of Mind.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Nonce">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
