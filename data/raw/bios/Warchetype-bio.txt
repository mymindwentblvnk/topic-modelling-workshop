Warchetype is a five member band established in Barcelona city, formed during October and November 2005. They all have loads of experience and a strong will of doing their own vision of a potent Doom Metal. Influenced by Black Sabbath, Saint Vitus, Candlemass and others, Warchetype's line up are Iban Arrieta on vocals, Jordi Boluda and David Bruguera on guitars, Ivan Román on bass player and Pep Caravante on drums. 
Their old bands played from extreme music to old genuine rock, true doom (Monolith, Great Coven), hard rock, rock-metal (The Eyes) and stoner, (Taunus, Camposanto & Santoro). Pep formed Taunus and Ivan Román sings with The Eyes one of 13 Grabaciones released (Pursuing the Misfortune), had gone on tour with Suffocation and High on Fire. Ibán Arrieta played with Great Coven an I Hate Records released (Viaticum), and now in Warchetype plays vocals and lyrics traying to express an allegoric vision of human behaviour, culture, mythology and social degeneration, based in his readings such as Balzac, Kant, Kafka, Hesse, Homer or Jenofonte. 
Warchetype's spine are Jordi with his slow-heavy-riffs and David with his genuine rock & blues accent. They all form Warchetype, which in less than a year had gone on tour in Valencia, Irún, Madrid, Donosti, Gandia, festivals and Doom-meetings with Overmars, Rhino, El Páramo, Lords of Bukake, and Neila, the Sabbath Doom Fest with Orthodox, Moho and Moksha at Mephisto in Barcelona. Alone Records is the reference of doom & stoner in Spain and its new released Goat Goddess Supremacy is Warchetype's first album. The battleaxes are sharp to fight the crusade for the hegemony of Doom. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Warchetype">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
