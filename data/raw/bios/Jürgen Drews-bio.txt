Jürgen Drews is a German pop/schlager musician.

Essentially serving as Germany's answer to Tom Jones, Drews secured his spot in the annals of German pop music with his trashy schlager singles and his flamboyant showmanship. After putting in his time with Die Anderen and the Les Humphries Singers, Drews went solo and broke onto the German pop charts in 1976 with a country crossover hit entitled "Ein Bett im Kornfeld" (A Bed in a Cornfield). Drews managed to score some minor hits throughout the '80s, and enjoyed a comeback in the '90s with the eurodance hit "König von Mallorca" (King of Majorca). Drews rode the popularity of that single well into the 2000s. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/J%C3%BCrgen+Drews">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
