In 2003 Ben Abraham decided he never wanted to sing again. The stunning career choice came after years of musical insecurity and tireless efforts to impress people; performing renditions of other people's songs he was told were cool at the time.

Content with leaving the dream of music behind, Ben turned instead to his screenwriting studies and fell in love with the art of film and the power of story.

It was four years before Ben picked up an instrument again, and it took meeting a young girl in hospital with anorexia. Confronted by her heartbreaking story, Ben did the best thing he knew how and wrote a song with the 13-year-old titled 'Let Your Light'. The moving ballad saw Ben flown to stages around the country where he would perform the song and tell the story at fundraisers for the Starlight Children's Foundation.

The life-altering experience opened Ben’s eyes to the idea of music as a language of the heart, reconciling the musician and storyteller – and he’s been singing for people ever since.

Since then Ben has played regularly in Melbourne venues such as Manchester Lane, The Wesley Anne, and The Toff In Town, as well as toured to Sydney and Jakarta, drawing audiences into the palm of his hand with his truly unique, personable performance style.

His soulful voice that is two parts the husky Indonesian of his father and one part the pure soprano of his Australian Mother, paired with his cheerfully uplifting tunes and catchy – oftentimes humorous – lyrics, make Ben Abraham a unique and exciting new talent in the Australian music scene. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ben+Abraham">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
