Moistboyz is a band founded by Mickey Melchiondo Jr. (guitar) and Guy Heller (vocals). In the spirit of Melchiondo's other group, Ween, the two have donned aliases. Melchiondo is known as the character Mickey Moist and Heller as Dickie Moist. Their music, like that of Ween, is often taken ironically by fans; some would even categorize them as comedy music, though they vehemently discourage this notion and argue that their entire purpose of the band is to support freedom of speech via rock n' roll music. The first two Moistboyz LP's, now sold together on one CD, are very minimal in production and feature drum machines and rapped lyrics. The third album moves away from the electronic sound and matures into a full-on live rock band, with the vocals being mostly screamed by Dickie Moist. The fourth LP, Moistboyz IV, mixes the hardcore sound with a more toned down heavy metal feel. The band released their first DVD, "Live Jihad", in June 2006.

The Moistboyz music is filled with lyrics that some perceive to be racist, chauvinistic, and homophobic. The band claims that they are not politically correct and are proud of their rights to free speech, gun ownership, and verbal assault on wrongs in society and in the music industry. This may or may not be a joke. The Moistboyz' music could be considered a parody of suburban music. In many songs, the listeners are reminded that the Moistboyz will never retire. In early 2008, a new touring lineup emerged, featuring Jeff Pinkus, formerly of Butthole Surfers, and Nick Oliveri of Mondo Generator and formerly of Queens of the Stone Age. They are currently being billed as Dickie Moist OTC while Mickey Moist is not involved in the band due to commitments with Ween. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Moistboyz">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
