Ecem BÃ¶ke (March 1, 1991), Turkish electropop musician. After just two singles we can already say Turkish electronic pop has a great new talent called Nova Norda. Combining a beautiful vocal and a remarkable melody in music is a simple equation, but at the same time it cannot be easily resolved. Luckily, we have a name from Istanbul that solves this equation at this time. Nova Norda has already signaled that she will come to a good place even if she has released only 2 songs to date. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nova+Norda">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
