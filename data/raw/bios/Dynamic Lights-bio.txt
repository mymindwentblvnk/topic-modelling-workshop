Dynamic Lights are born in Pesaro, Italy, in 1997 and from the beginning they tried to write songs to express their feelings and ideas: Progressive music was the result of this. The band recorded a demo named Night Lights (1999) and the self-produced EP Resurrection (2002). The EP has been welcomed with exciting reviews everywhere, ranging from Italian metal magazines to European and American music websites. Thanks to this 2003 has been a fantastic year for Dynamic Lights: they signed with DVS Records for the release of a full-length album, and they played live gigs with celebrated band as Pain Of Salvation, Shaman, Lacuna Coil, Infernal Poetry and others. They also got a collaboration with the Italian satellite channel Rock TV, which decided to include the combo inside their Rock TV tour and to let them present the program Database for a day. During 2004 Dynamic Lights have worked on their first full length album Shape and during the first half of 2005 it has been released worldwide through all distribution partners of DVS Records. At the end of April the guys joined Swedish band Nightingale for their “10th Anniversary European Tour” and played with them and Tomorrow’s Eve in Denmark, Germany and The Netherlands. At the beginning of October 2005 they played again with Pain Of Salvation and with great bands like Wolverine and Pagan's Mind at the prestigious “ProgPower Europe 2005” in The Netherlands where they received a lot of enthusiastic criticisms and a great support from the crowd and from the international press. Currently Dynamic Lights are working in order to promote Shape. So far this album has received many amazing reviews and good responses by the people.
