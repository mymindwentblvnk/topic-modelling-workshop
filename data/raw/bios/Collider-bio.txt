2. Collider (2009) is a young San Francisco rock band that recently recorded and released their debut album “Down In Saturines”. Named after large particle accelerators, Collider’s music revels in both the bombastic beauty of energy and more subtle moments of delicacy, like particle patterns moments before collision.
Collider is a San Francisco, California music project we originally featured in January 2010 with their first pair of EP releases. Almost exactly one year later, in January 2011, founding musician John Ricksen and brother Mark Ricksen were also mentioned here with another experimental project in Illogical Time Concerns. The latest collection of seven songs, titled Vaede EP, manages to touch the sweet static of Scandinavian pop while not forgetting the drive of post-shoegaze influence where early 90s artists Ride, or even the likes of Swervedriver are concerned.
