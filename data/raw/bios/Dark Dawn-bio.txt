Creation of the Dark Dawn began in late winter months of 2006, when Vladimir asked Boba and Djole to join him on a new project he was working on. Although they were all busy with there other bands at the time, the first song was finished by the end of 2006 and the “Sound that marks the end” was the beginning of Dark Dawn. Work continued in 2007, new songs and ideas came at a steady paste and the three members decided that it was time to complete the band and take there work to a new level. After a pretty long search the second guitarist was found in young Lukas who took guitar lessons from Vladimir and showed great interest in the project and the drummer was found in an old friend and former band mate Sale. Now the only thing that was missing was the name. On April 21st after a “little” drinking time the name was taken from one of the songs created in the beginning of the project the “Dark Dawn”. Since then the band played many shows in there hometown and made a few trips to nearby cities and is currently finishing the recording of there first demo. 

During the summer of 2008 Dark Dawn parted ways with there drummer and friend Aleksandar Fekete because of musical differences. 
A quest for a new drummer started immediately but many months will pass in a frustrating search. 
After many tryouts and disappointments the quest has finally ended, and in October 2008 Dark Dawn is completed with an experienced and masterful drummer that is Töröcsik Nagy Gábor. 
Work resumes, Dark Dawn is coming soon…
