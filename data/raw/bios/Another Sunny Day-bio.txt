Another Sunny Day was the pseudonym for multi-instrumentalist Harvey Williams under which he recorded a half-dozen or so singles on Sarah Records.

The famous "Anorak City" flexi was a scratchy scene anthem celebrating the siren allure of indie-trainspotterdom. "You Should All Be Murdered" was indie pop's somewhat Smiths-esque answer to Harry Secombe's "If I Ruled The World". And then came perhaps the most "Sarah in a nutshell" single of them all, a heady collision of obsessive-romanticism, gorgeous twelve-string shimmer and just the right redemptive twinkle of knowing irony: "I'm In Love With A Girl Who Doesn't Know I Exist". "So I'll just lie and dream of the chances I've missed..."

All these singles are collected onto the London Weekend compilation. Harvey later went on to record several albums under his own name. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Another+Sunny+Day">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
