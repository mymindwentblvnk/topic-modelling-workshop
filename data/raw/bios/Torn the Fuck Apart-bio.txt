Since the formation of Kansas City’s Torn The Fuck Apart in late 2004, the band has been busy ripping people’s faces off with a relentless onslaught of brutality. With the release of 2006’s EP “Skinned Alive” and consistent touring, the band gained many loyal followers. In July 2009 they released their first full length album, "Gods of Gore" and embarked on a US tour with metal veterans Monstrosity in support of it. They have continued to perform regularly around the Midwest during the past three years while writing and recording their follow up album, "...The Dissection of Christ” which was released in April 2012.
