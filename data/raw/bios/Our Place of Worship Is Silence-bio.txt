Our Place of Worship is Silence is a California death metal project featuring current and former members of bands such as Lake of Blood, Doctorshopper, L'Acephale, and Knelt Rote. 

Our Place of Worship is Silence's voice into the void was announced in 2014. Upon retrieving and enhancing faded disciplines, it became anew - the heralds of frenzied chaos. The band has acknowledged the dire faith of rigorously manipulating the scope of black and death metal. Thematically rich in dynamic misanthropy and existential dread, Our Place of Worship is Silence is here to unveil that the will of all is the will of none. 

Debut album The Embodiment of Hate is dedicated to Tim Butcher (5/28/88-12/5/15). He will be forever missed. Rest in power. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Our+Place+of+Worship+is+Silence">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
