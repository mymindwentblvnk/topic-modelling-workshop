Maniac Forces started as Barbed Wire in 2006. They hadn’t a vocalist. When they had their own festival called Pinjopop in 2006 they asked a really drunk Pieter Sitaniapessy to sing a really drunk song. And from that moment on Barbed Wire was complete. Pieter Sitaniapessy (vocals) Jeroen Houwen (guitar) Jan van Rooij (guitar) Joost Kersten (bass) Joey Joosten (drums). After a few gigs they decided Barbed Wire wasn’t the right name and they turned their name into MANIAC FORCES!!! After a while the musical differences with Jeroen got to big, and they decided that it was time to say goodbye to Jeroen. The time came for our new guitar player, Koen Janssen!
