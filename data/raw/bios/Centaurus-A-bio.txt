CENTAURUS-A was formed in the year 2000 by Maik Matanovic (guitar), Patrick Schroeder (drums) and Michael Ahlgrimm (bass/backing vocals) in Cologne (NRW), Germany. Only a few months later, the demo "Last step Line" containing the band's first songs, was recorded. With the same line-up, CENTAURUS-A went on to write new songs and recorded its second demo entitled "Nimbus" in 2002, as well as started playing the first live shows supported by a session singer.

In 2003, the band's line-up was completed with guitarist Hernan Martinez and permanent vocalist Johannes "Jojo" Henke. This was a great leap forward and CENTAURUS-A continued to develop its unique and advanced mix of technical death/thrash metal. A lot of time and effort was put in writing new songs which were released on the first studio-recorded demo "Narcotic" and got positive feedback and reviews from fans and the metal press. In the following years, the band played numerous gigs all over Germany and achieved an excellent reputation as an energetic live-band.

The time was ripe for the next step and CENTAURUS-A entered the Hansen Studios (Denmark) in April 2007 to start the recordings of the debut album "Side Effects Expected". After several recording sessions and loads of work, the mastering was finished in the beginning of 2008. The result is an album containing 10 unique and outstanding songs of technical but catchy death metal. CENTAURUS-A signed a record deal on LISTENABLE RECORDS and released their debut album in march 2009. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Centaurus-A">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
