Tiña are an indie rock band from south London, United Kingdom. The project brings together members of Bat-Bike, Uncle Tesco and Pet Grotesque. 

Having come to the attention of Speedy Wunderground boss Dan Carey at a party, he was hooked on Tiña and studio time was arranged. The result is the group's début single, 'I Feel Fine' (2019). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ti%C3%B1a">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
