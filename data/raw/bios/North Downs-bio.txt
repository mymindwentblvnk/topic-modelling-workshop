North Downs was born in a run-down barn in the wintery English countryside, the lovechild of a Delta Blues man and a London raver, marrying the sounds of the organic and the synthetic. There’s a wonderful clarity in this unique fusion. It’s genre-blended, but each ingredient works independently, fixating you on the journey. 

The collaborative nature of how this music is produced is paramount. On their 2019 début EP Dad's Old Tapes, those with more discerning ears may pick up elements of fellow artists such as Khruangbin, Jake Bright, Dan Chappell, Andreya Triana and of course Maribou State, creating a melting pot of talent with North Downs at the helm.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/North+Downs">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
