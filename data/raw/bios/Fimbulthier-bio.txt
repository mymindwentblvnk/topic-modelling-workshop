Fimbulthier started to play together in a holiday apartment of a friend, in spring 2004 calling themselves "Purifying Fire". First they tried as a Death Metal Band. By loss of this rehearsal room in autumn 2004 it got relatively quiet over half a year, but one by one they evolved musically further. 

In early summer 2005 the band got together again. While listening exclusively heathen music in the meantime, they decided to getting active, keeping the memories of the ancestors in their music. Then finally the group found a full rehearsal room in the old brewery Annaberg, in October 2005. At this time Fimbulthier finished their first demo cd, under their own management label.
