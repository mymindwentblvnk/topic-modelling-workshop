Danish-Icelandic duo Kúra consisting of producer Brynjar Bjarnfoss - Icelandic born - raised in Copenhagen and Brynjar’s cousin, the singer Fanney Ósk Þórisdóttir from Reykjavik, Iceland. 
Together they unite dreamy electronica with dub-elements spiced up with a gracious vocal, in a well-produced melodic universe. The family-duo released their debut EP “Multicolor” in December 2010 with remixes by Max Cooper (UK) and Lulu Rouge (DK). 

Kúra were awarded with “Best Electronica Act” at the Danish Underground Music Awards in late April 2011 in Copenhagen.

They released their debut album, Halfway to the Moon, in 2012. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/K%C3%BAra">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
