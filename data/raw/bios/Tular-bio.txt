Tular is a project started by Francesca Martini (Lead Vocals) and Emanuele Palmieri (Lead Guitar) in the summer of 2005 as the natural product of their passions.
Tular is an etruscan word that means:"Borderline". Their songs are in fact tales from the line between real world and fantasy.

Even if could seem the same old story, Tular are a new band, strongly oriented to be original and different from other bands.

In the winter of 2005 the old experienced "Bass Master" of the Graal (Hard Rock band) Michele Raspanti joined the project with a old school hummin' hand that made the sound grow.

Hard work for songwriting and orchestration of classical instruments and guitars for the entire 2006. In January 2007 Alessandro Iacobellis, decided to be the rythm guitar for the Tular.
Last but not least, in June one of the greatest metal drummers, David Folchitto, joins Tular givin' to the sound a strong kickass with his crazy fills and grooves.
July 2007: Tular meet Johhny Lifeson, guitarist and DJ from Radio Metal Storm (CT) and after a few days we have a good friendship that give to the band an american management by the DJ Dime Bag Dave and Dr.Hook.
During Xmas 2007 they have a contact from Renaissance Records (AZ) and now, we are waiting for their first album, "The truth behind the mask" scheduled for late spring 2008. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tular">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
