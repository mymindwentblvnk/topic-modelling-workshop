After The Bombs was a female-fronted crust punk / stenchcore band from Montreal, Quebec, Canada . The band formed in January 2004 - a year after the disbanding of Hellbound. Influences are heavily drawn from the early dark and metallic crust sound, resembling the works of bands such as Amebix, Sacrilege, Antisect, Deviated Instinct, Axegrinder, etc. After The Bombs officially called it quits, sometime between 2010 and 2011.
