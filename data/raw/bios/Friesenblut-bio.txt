The Frisians were a Germanic tribe at the North Sea coast of continental Europe, whose name was already known to the Romans and was feared for its pugnaciousness and impregnable desire for freedom. In many battles and revolts against Romans, Saxons, Franks and Vikings they always protected their highest property - the Frisian Freedom. This preoccupation of their forefathers was sustained till the Late Middle Ages and got lost during the radical change of the Modern Era. Until now, because Frisian Blood („Friesenblut“) will flow again... 

FriesenBlut stands for incrementally blackened Death Metal with pagan lyrics about the roots and history of the early Frisians. In view of this fact we're calling our kind of music „Blackened Pagan Death“.

In February 2007 Melanie, Jens and Lukas decided to connect their preferences for extreme metal music with their interests in frisian history and founded the band „FriesenBlut“. After the writing of their first two songs they've found a fit vocalist named Tobias and wrote three another songs. In the middle of the year 2007 Torsten entered the band, twisted around and turned everything upside down. At first he was playing the bass, but then Lukas left the band and Torsten became the second guitar player. Without having a new bass player the band entered the Audiocheck Studio in October 2007 and recorded their first demo cd. At the end of 2007 Hendrik entered the band and completed the horde again.
