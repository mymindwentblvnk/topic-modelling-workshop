Sorgeldom once started as an acoustic project by S_ that later developed into a metal band with some experimental parts and a small amount of shoegaze influences but still with the roots in black metal.

Our debut album "Innerlig Förmörkelse" is now released by Frostscald Records.
The album is available to buy directly from the band for 10EUR/100SEK + postage rate.
