Sebastian Sturm belongs to the next generation of young Reggae Artists but performs the Roots Reggae so convincingly that you feel like you were back in the good old days of Seventies Roots Reggae.

Sebastian is the product of a German-Indonesian Love Story. Aged 14 he founded his first Punk Band. Reggae brought him from screaming to singing, but Punk brought him his extraordinary Voice.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sebastian+Sturm">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
