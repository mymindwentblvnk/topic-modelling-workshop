Cartesian Other is Melodic Death Metal from California, USA. With influences drawn from Black Metal and Doom as well, Cartesian Other's sound covers a broad range. The 7 song, full length Album is available since May 2007.

Cartesian Other is currently working on a follow-up album, called "The Hour Before You Die". Currently one song is available: Blind, and shows a significant change in style, including clean singing. As this song is a bonus track for THBYD, fans of the first album may see a big stylistic change, but rest assured that the songs on THBYD are a hybrid of the genres found on Introscopic Deluge and the song "Blind". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cartesian+Other">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
