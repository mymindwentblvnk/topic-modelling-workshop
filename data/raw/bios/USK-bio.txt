In 1984, USK was born in a country-side city in Japan. Life used to be boring for him until he met the soft sequencer at 16 years old. It changed his life. He created over 40 tracks with it although it was DEMO which didn't permit saving data, he made over 150 songs after he bought it until he was 18 years old.

In 2002, he moved to Fukuoka and joined a nerdcore techno organization called Techno-b, he then met "minimal techno", which he fell in love with and started to DJ.

His real passion began in september 2005, he started creating songs with GAMEBOY as well. He then started to use portalenz which is a lo-bit techno unit playing 5GAMEBOYs + mod toys with friend and fellow artist MARU (an unsavory but inseparable relationship).
From December the same year, he started TSUJI TECHNO which is the Street Techno Art Organization with MARU.

In February 2006, he released "Joy and Sorrow" from Peeled Tracks, but started to have doubts about his progress in techno music. In 10th March of the same year, the X-day, he played at HARDCORE party organized by BSK. He then developed an interest in creating breakcore, drum&bass and hardcore music instead of techno. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/USK">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
