1) VAK is a Swedish progressive sludge band.
"VAK is back from the dead! During 2018, one member turned gravely ill from Lemierre’s syndrome and a thrombose in the head. There was little hope, anything could happen, but fortunately he recovered and VAK are back from the dead with their new album “Loud Wind”! The music from the Swedes in VAK is hard to grasp. They combine aggressive melodies with precise and potent rock experiments. “Loud Wind” is mixed and mastered by Magnus Lindberg (Cult Of Luna). "

2) VAK is a french progressive rock / zeuhl band formed in 2008. Its influences have extended since then to broader and more extreme genres, from metal to experimental rock. VAK's music mixes multiple echoes from the rock avant-gardes of the 1970s and a taste for newer experimental progressive musics.   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/VAK">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
