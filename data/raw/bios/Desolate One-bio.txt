Desolate One is:
Nuclear Tormentor - All Instruments
Hideous Possessor - Vocals

Desolate One, a garage Black/Death Metal band from Red Bluff, California, by Nuclear Tormentor.  They play fast-paced Black/Death in the style of early extreme metal bands like Blasphemy.

"The drums are crisp and organic sounding, right up front. It helps too that the drummer is top-notch. The production reeks of a demo, but that's not really a complaint being that it is a demo afterall. The guitars are crunchy and heavy, yet thin enough to stray from the buzzy affair of Blasphemy and Conqueror. The vocals are raspy, throaty black metal vocals, and thankfully not reverberate deep bellows." (Review from chainsawjustice.blogspot.com)
