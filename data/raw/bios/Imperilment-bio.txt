Imperilment are a 5 piece metal band from Canberra, Australia. They have been working tirelessly over the last few years and finally about to release their debut EP 'The Shift' at the end of January!

Their sound is based around melodic, progressive groove metal with vocals that range from aggressive screams to clean, skin tingling melodies much like Jesse Leech of Killswitch Engage.

With fast passed, technical riffs and complicated yet groovy drum compositions, Imperilment have developed a voice of their own and really make their mark in the Australin metal community, and the world!

Imperilment's live show is not to be missed!! Their passion and energy is up on stage where they can connect with their audience! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Imperilment">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
