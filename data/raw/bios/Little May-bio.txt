Little May is a pop/folk/indie band formed in Sydney, NSW, Australia in 2012. In 2018, with the departure of lead guitarist Annie Hamilton, the band is now Liz Drummond and Hannah Field.

A Sydney-based indie-folk band, Little May creates sprawling yet intricate heart-warming harmonies. Formed from the story-telling talents of Hannah Field, Liz Drummond and Annie Hamilton; Little May is the tale of three friends making a name for themselves and winning hearts both locally and abroad. 

Playing at Secret Garden Festival 2013 and the Australia Music Prize PRE-AMP function, the girls have received a reputation for capturing audiences with their guitar driven melodies and skilful songwriting. Sharing stages with the likes of Triple J heart throb, Dustin Tebbutt, as well as selling out their own headline show in Sydney, Little May show no sign of slowing down. 

Heavily inspired by the likes of folk-loving friends, Fleetwood Mac, Mumford & Sons and Local Natives, the outfit make a notable nod to the likes of fem-folk trailblazers such as Julia Stone and Holly Throsby. 

The second single 'Hide' was plucked from their debut EP released in late 2013. Testament to Little May's diversity, 'Hide' is a darker, more intricate offering and follows on from the flowing reviews received from their debut single, 
'Boardwalks'. Recorded and produced by Sam Thomlinson and Michael McGlynn, and mixed by Michael McGlynn at Vienna People Studios, the single was mastered by William Bowden at King Willy Sound, mastering engineer and joint winner with Gotye of Record of the Year at the 55th Grammy Awards, 2013.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Little+May">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
