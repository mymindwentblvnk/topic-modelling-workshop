Hailing from Orlando, Florida, MONOTHEIST draws influences from such acts as DEATH, EXTOL, OPETH, SUFFOCATION, EMPEROR and IMMOLATION. A melting pot of death, black, thrash, and progressive metal, MONOTHEIST writes complex compositions that extend the boundaries of extreme metal. Furious riffing and ferocious drumming walk hand in hand with progressive stanzas and melodic nuances, painting an aural masterpiece of intensity. Each song has an epic feel and flows effortlessly from one stanza to the next without ever losing the interest of the listener. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Monotheist">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
