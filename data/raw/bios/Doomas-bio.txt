Doomas is a relatively new Melodic Doom Metal band formed in 2006. They hail from Nová Baňa, Slovakia and they play melodic doom/death metal. Might appeal to fans of early Anathema, My Dying Bride and Paradise Lost.

"The band Doomas was born on September 2006. I had few ideas so I decided to offer the players from bands Anima and Sapiens to try some of them. And this is the way how was created Doomas. After three months of practising we had done many songs, three of them we decided to record in studio Pramos in Zlate Moravce. The reactions on our first demo were good, we were fascinated. With great iniciative we began doing new songs. But our female vocalist decided to not to be a part of Doomas and we are finding back-up for her. Once while we were practising and summoning the devils from hell came a girlfriend of our technician. She decided to sing few gigs with us, but today we are without her. Our guitarist Tommy decided to leave the band and play only in Anima. Fortunately Koczo from Sapiens accepted to play with us and in this line-up we are playing now. Today we are working on new things, playing concerts and planning to make new CD with not official name Bleeding. Keep staying with us! DOOMAS" -- taken from their MySpace page.
