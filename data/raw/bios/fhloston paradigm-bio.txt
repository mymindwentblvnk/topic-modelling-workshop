The Afrofuturist techno alias of veteran polyglot King Britt, Fhloston Paradigm -- a reference to Luc Besson's 1997 science fiction film The Fifth Element -- debuted in 2009 with Charlie Sleeps, an EP dedicated to Telefon Tel Aviv's Charlie Cooper, who had recently passed away. Like that release, a couple additional short-form releases that followed through 2011 were made available as free downloads. 

In 2012, Britt connected with Kode9's Hyperdub label, where he released the brilliant three-track 12" and digital download Chasing Rainbows. Britt, active as ever with numerous artistic endeavours -- including one-album duo Saturn Never Sleeps -- put Fhloston Paradigm on ice, then released an album, The Phoenix, on Hyperdub in 2014. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fhloston+Paradigm">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
