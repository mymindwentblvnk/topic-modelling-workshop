Winter Sky was started in January 2005, in Campinas, São Paulo, Brazil, by Marcio “Trooper” (guitar), Tiago Toledo (guitar), Gian Bertucci (drums), Rodrigo “Pikeno” (bass) and Vainus (vocals).
Over their first year as a band, it started putting its identity together making its work known through concerts at clubs and festivals as it underwent numerous changes in its line-up. After Rodrigo left the band, Gian changed to bass and Gustavo Badur replaced him on drums. After that, Carlos “Kadu” became the new lead singer in Vainus’ place. Later, however Gian left the band and Rodrigo returned. With new members and greater stability in the band, they continued to perform at different venues in their hometown as well as in other cities such as Paulinia, Sao Paulo and Mogi Guacu, Sao Paulo.
In October 2006, Kadu decided to leave the band. In the same year, after the return of Vainus, the group continued working on its own songs and its first demo record.
Early 2007 marks a new stage of evolution for the band, with the release of its demo record entitled “Find Your Dreams” and a concert alongside Viper, an extremely important band in the Brazilian Heavy Metal scene.
Winter Sky’s current line-up is Marcio “Trooper” and Tiago Toledo on guitars, Gustavo Badur on drums, Rodrigo “Pikeno” on bass and Vainus on vocals.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Winter+Sky">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
