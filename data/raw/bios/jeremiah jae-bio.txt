Jeremiah Jae is a Chicago based emcee, producer, healer, and artist on Flying Lotus' record label Brainfeeder. He is also a member of the group YBP (Young Black Preachers), and apart of the Black Jungle Squad Cxllective. 

 Jae's orbited around the vibrant LA beat scene for ages. After meeting FlyLo online years ago, he decamped to the West Coast for a good six months and soaked up the mind-expanding sounds emanating from the venerable imprint. Soon he got signed, and after exploring soundscapes around the globe with labelmate Teebs, Jae finally abandoned Chi-town to make weird art-rap in LA full time

Jae released the ''Dxnce EP'' as a free project in 2009. After several other mixtapes and collab projects, he put out his Brainfeeder debut project ''Rappayamatantra'' in 2011. His debut full-length ''Raw Money Raps'' was put out in 2012 to much acclaim.

“I think it’s safe to say Jeremiah Jae is one of my favorite artists of his generation. For years now I’ve been a witness to the incredible progression of his craft. Underrated and understated, Jae is ready to show these muhfuckers what’s really good. Believe in Jeremiah Jae” – Flying Lotus
