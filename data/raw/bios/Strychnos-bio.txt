The murderous entity of STRYCHNOS was deformed by MLA in early 1998. Combining forces with JH the first Strychnos release "Demo tracks 1998" was created.

Horror Records found interest in STRYCHNOS and in 2000 "Terror Lies Within" materialized as 666 bloodstained 7" vinyls. Shortly after the release, the band was paused because of geographical problems and involvement in other bands. 

In December 2004 STRYCHNOS was finally reborn, joining forces with battery NL and Guitarslasher JFP the line-up became stronger than ever. The next years were spent writing new material and forging a live performance beyond all humanity.

The STRYCHNOS minialbum "Undead Unsouls Unbound" WAS released 20th February 2011 - on CD through german FDA Rekotz and on MC through danish Deadbangers Productions. A vinyl edition will follow, though yet uncertain on which label. 
German Kneel Before the Masters Throne Records will release a 12" vinyl containing all the old STRYCHNOS material + two bonus tracks exclusively recorded for this release. Entitled "Lessons in Terror", this deformity will see the dead of night 31.03.20011. 

STRYCHNOS will continue to explore the boundaries of otherness, opposition, embedded evil and hate: One of the most extreme, bizarre and perverted musical experiences ever to emerge from Denmark. We will enjoy raping your corpse. .... A lesson in terror has just begun!
