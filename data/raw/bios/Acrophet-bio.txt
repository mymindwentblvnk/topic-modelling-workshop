Formed in 1983 in Brookfield, WI, Acrophet was a thrash metal band remembered by experts in the field for their impressive musical chops, if not for contributing much of anything new to the genre during their short career. The group released two full albums through Triple X Records -- 1988's Corrupt Minds and 1990's Faded Glory. Perhaps its originality was in its lyrics, which were about politics, social issues, against prejudices, etc. a bit similar to bands such as: Nuclear Assault, Sacred Reich, Xentrix, Anacrusis, Nations of Death or Corrupt Soul. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Acrophet">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
