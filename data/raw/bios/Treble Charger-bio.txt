Treble Charger was a Canadian rock group from Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada, formed in 1992. The band consists of vocalist Greig Nori, bassist Rosie Martin and drummer Trevor MacGregor. Guitarist Bill Priddle, a founding member of the band, left in 2003. They began with a melodic indie rock style, but have evolved into more of a pop punk band since signing to a major label in 1997.

The band was originally  named NC17 but had to change their name due to some dispute with a US band of the same name. The original drummer was Morris Palter (from inception to 1997) who is now a reknowned percussionist and assistant professor of music.

The band released 5 studio albums in their time, but Greig Nori disbanded Treble Charger in 2006, ending its 14 year existence.

Greig Nori continues to work for Bunk Rock Entertainment as the manager/producer of Canadian Rock Band Sum 41.

Bill Priddle is involved with many projects post-Treble Charger, working with Broken Social Scene and Don Vail as well as releasing an album of solo material as The Priddle Concern

Trevor MacGregor was the drummer during what was the last 9 years of Treble Charger, thus making him the longest drummer to stay with them. He is now currently the drummer of Four Square.

On January 20, 2012, it was confirmed that the band will reunite (without Martin and MacGregor). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Treble+Charger">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
