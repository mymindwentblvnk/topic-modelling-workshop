The first plans for what later would become Curse of the Forgotten developed in 2006. At that time guitarists Roelof Klop and Richard Vrijhof played together on a regular basis. After meeting drummer Gerjo Fuhler they started on writing their first songs. Searching for the right vocalist they at first focussed on writing instrumental songs. A while there after they found the vocalist they wanted in the brother of Gerjo, Marijn Fuhler. Combining vocals and bass the band was completed and the writing process continued. Now, in 2010 Curse of the Forgotten has over a dozen songs written. Melodic and always technical thrashmetal, with undisputed deathmetal influences. Their first five songs were recently recorded on their demo called Sacrafice, with Wingsofdeath.nu. Curse of the Forgotten is now playing gigs all over to expand the rapid growing audiences even further. You will be hearing from Curse of the Forgotten..
