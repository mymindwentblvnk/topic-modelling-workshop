Atheistc is the side project by Dilpho Castro, co-founder and guitarist and vocalist of the gothic metal band Silent Cry . The first release by Atheistc was the Demo CD entitled “The Angel of the Dark Garden” with four tracks. The debut album “The End of the Christian Age” soon came out, with ten tracks and a 16 pages booklet. The album got very good reviews for its quality and authenticity. Now Atheistc is getting in studio to record the new album, and is already releasing on the web the single “Killing My Religion” as a preview of the future release. With Atheistc Dilpho Castro expresses other feeling in a perfect mix between “Orchestral Atmospheric” and “Dark Metal” elements. Resulting in songs with a unique sonority filled with sentiment, which is exactly what sets apart Dilpho Castro, who is known by those who follow his work as a musician who always seeks originality, always innovating, what makes Atheistc very hard to categorize. As for the lyrics, Atheistc exposes many incoherencies and divergences found in Christianity and its subdivisions. The first Full Length “The End of the Christian Age” came out with very special guests such as: Lord Vlad (Malefactor) on the track "The End of The Christian Age" - Fabila Tozi (Silent Cry) on the track "Romantic Sin" - André Damien (Paradise In Flames) on the track "The Throne's Fall" <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Atheistc">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
