Introducing A Broken Machine from St Petersburg, Florida, a band that is taking the local scene by storm! Composed of five members, Phil (vocals), Brett (guitar), Jeff (guitar), Bobby (bass) and Larry (drums), together they create a mind-blowing progressive-metal sound! 



Each member draws influence from bands ranging from Pantera to The Red Chord. All the members have between six and thirteen years of experience under there belts. 



The band formed in November of ’03, and after prevailing through a number of lineup changes, began bringing their unique brand of metal to the area. After their explosive entrance onto the local scene, ABM began opening for some impressive national acts such as Adema, NonPoint and The Absence. 



In ‘06 ABM released their self-titled album, which was nominated for two awards in the Florida Hard Music Awards. As a follow up A Broken Machine is scheduled to release their new EP “Choke on Em” June 28, 2008.



Expectations are high, and A Broken Machine is poised to deliver. The EP was recorded with Mark Prator of RedRoom Recorders and mastered by Jim Morris of Morrisound, all of Tampa, Florida. One of UDTV’s own, graphic artist Draven KaCorso put the finished touches on the album, creating the twisted cover and disc art. 



Currently working with MT Head Records, things are looking up for A Broken Machine in the beginning of ’08. They are eager to take their music to the next level by continuing to do what they love, and constantly writing new music to keep their sound a step above the rest. You can expect to see many more tours with A Broken Machine and keep your eyes peeled for their next full-length album.
