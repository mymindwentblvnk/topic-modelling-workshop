Thorr-Axe is a raiding party comprised of three guys with a mutual love of heavy music. We belch forth tales of dragons, wizards, frost giants, and vikings putting axes through people's skulls. Our debut album "Wall of Spears" is currently available on Bigcartel, CDbaby, Amazon, iTunes, Bandcamp, and most other online music retailers. Our second album titled 'Gates of Winter' is currently in the works and is available for preorder on our Bigcartel page. The album is set to be out sometime in 2014 but the official release date is not yet known. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Thorr-Axe">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
