For the first time the Band gathered in 2001 in a small village called Kozow to bring to the world chaos and destruction. The founders of this morbid squad were: Nakahed - Guitar, Chaos - Drums and Thot - Vocal and later Bass guitar. The band stayed there for a whole week and recorded they're first unreleased demo "Dead Marches". One year later there came a new member, Pawel Koziel. He took a rhytmic guitar. With him the band recorded some shitty tracks. 2002 - Slepy on the vocal. He didn't last long. Paula Drazkiewicz joined Nar Speth. Her mission was to play some dark tunes on her keyboard, but she became a major dissapointment due to her lack of activity in 2003 and got kicked out of the band. Soon, because of many quarrels and disagreements among musicians the band split up. 2005 - Reactivation of Nar Speth. Pawel Koziel never came back. Core members Chaos, Nakahed and Thot decided to try some more with a keybord, so they asked Paula Drazkiewicz to rejoin. They recorded with her the new unreleased demo "Death comes at twighlight" ... but it sucked... there won't be women nor keyboards in this band, never again! 2006 - Hypnos joined the band but it was a mistake. He was a miserable failure, as all of them FNGs. A few days later Storm joined Nar Speth as a guitarist. Now, the new squad is: Nakahed - guitar, Storm - guitar, Thot - bass guitar and Vocal, Chaos - drums. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nar+Speth">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
