Over the last 20 years, Ozay Moore (fka Othello) has proven himself to be an exceptional storyteller time and time again. Whether as a member of the classic hip hop trio, Lightheaded, or as a solo artist, Moore's alto flow has always moved crowds. Aided by some of the most soulful production and a deep knowledge of hip hop culture, Moore's music is highly relatable because he blends personal experience with larger themes that cross cultural lines. Moore has been making records for quite some time so it would be understandable if he didn't have more to say.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ozay+Moore">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
