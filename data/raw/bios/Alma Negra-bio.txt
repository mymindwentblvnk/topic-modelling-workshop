There is more than one artist under this name:

1) The Alma Negra collective consists of four Swiss based artists who cross many musical traditions and cultures with their eclectic sound, with roots in Cape Verde, Italy, Portual and Spain.
Collectively the quartet’s influences and skills are as broad as they are diverse, pooling together a vast musical knowledge that ranges from jazz to African and Latin, from Donald Byrd to Theo Parrish via Fela Kuti.

2) Alma Negra is a female-fronted heavy quartet bending genres of metal, psyche and sludge - they have been described as “space doom” and “dirge rock”. Coined as the “ultimate marriage of local garage and metal” by the Chicago Reader, the group is comprised of established musicians bringing their seemingly disparate influences together to create a unique sound. Their debut record, a split 12” with Chicago group, Himalayan, (former members of Raise the Red Lantern and owners of Emperor guitar cabinets) is set to be released early May 2012.
