Joon Guillen (sometime Fish Trio, Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man, We Kick Ass for the Lord, and Outerhope) has found a new friend in the monome. He left Manila in 2007 to get a Master’s degree in IT in Hong Kong, where he is still presently based. As Modulogeek (www.modulogeek.com), Guillen has entered the world of electronic music and has begun to produce, even in its “jam” phase, what might be his finest work to date. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/ModuloGeek">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
