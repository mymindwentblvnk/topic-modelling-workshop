Necrolytic formed in 1999 in Portland Oregon. Originally the brainchild of Seth Burns (vocals/drums/guitar/samples), a musician/artist artist from Northern California, Necrolytic got its true beginning somewhere during the latter half of 2000. Seth Burns attending Pacific Northwest College of Art was suffering from the effects of untreated ADHD, his music beyond sporadic, was coerced and focused through various illegal substances and and the joining of members Jesse "Durt" Gallagher (Drums), and Tim Davis (MIDI wind controller). Necrolytic recorded Parasites an album that almost defines the inner workings of Seth himself and in 2001 Steve "Steeb" Cavalli (Guitar) Joined the ranks to record Parasites II, later to be renamed Full Blown A.I.D.S. The over the top vocal work, guitar blur and  blast drumming creates a very discomforting atmosphere, 8 songs crossing the finish line at 7 minutes 14 seconds. in 2002 they released Their most circulated album, the ltd. released Blasphemic Blasphemy EP. Necrolytic continues to tour North America & Japan with Current Members: Seth Burns (vocals/samples), Steeb Cavalli (guitars) and Durt Gallagher (drums).   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Necrolytic">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
