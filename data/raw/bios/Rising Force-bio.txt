Rising Force was the name of Yngwie Malmsteen's band in Sweden before he came to America. The members were: Yngwie (guitars), Marcel Jacob(bass; he later was on Yngwie's albums Marching Out and Inspiration), and Zepp Urgard(drums.)
Back then, metal vocalists in Sweden were rare, so Yngwie and Marcel handled the vocal duties.
They recorded one demo with this lineup in 1980 at Thunderload Studios. It was never released until 2002 when Marcel remastered and released the demo with the title Birth of the Sun.
Shortly after this release Yngwie Malmsteen released his own remastered version of the demo with an interview and 2 bonus tracks. The cd is called The Genesis. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rising+Force">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
