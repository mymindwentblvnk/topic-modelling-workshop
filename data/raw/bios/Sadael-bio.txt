Sadael is a dark ambient project from Yerevan, Armenia with some elements and passages of funeral doom. His music can't be counted considered totally metal, but rather as doom ambient.
Vocals' complex of  deep growls, grunts and throaty voices with some beautiful choirs and organs, utterly depressive, deeply dark and extremely slow. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sadael">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
