Toxic Virgin have been together since 1995 and published four CDs (Love Rocket EP 1999, Toxic Virgin CD 2000, Circle of Power CD 2001, Sulphur CD 2004) which received excellent reviews in musical publications and were highly acclaimed all over the world . The live concerts of the five musicians from Germany, (e. g. together with STATUS QUO, THERAPY?, DOG EAT DOG, DORO PESCH or BONFIRE), attract and convince audiences all over Germany and even abroad. The quality of this band also granted their twice repeated participation in the finals of the German Rock Musicians Awards. Itâ€™s obvious that they are on the road to success. 
Finally, in July 2007 Angel met Toxic Virgin and succeeded in convincing them of her extraordinary talent and starts as the singer and new voice of Toxic Virgin
