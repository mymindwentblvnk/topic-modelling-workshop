Martin $ky is a hip-hop producer and former emcee from Chicago.

Martin got into music 10+ years ago when a friend showed him FL Studio. He states that his mission has always been to just be there for the listener and let them know that they're not alone in the world no matter what they think. 

He became famous in the freestyle rapping scene in Chicago and got a lot of praise. But since 2016 he has produced fulltime. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Martin+$ky">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
