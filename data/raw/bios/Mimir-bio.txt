Mimir is a joint music project started by The Legendary Pink Dots member Edward Ka-Spel and the father of numerous other projects Christoph Heemann. Having similar interests in musical experimentation, specifically in textural music, the two started recording in Heemann's studio. In 1991 their first, self-titled, album came out on the Flabbergast label. Later Ka-Spel mentioned that in this album the project failed to achieve its goal, because Christoph Heemann was not selective enough when mastering contributors' pieces and the album was not a "whole" as was planned. Two of the following albums the group members consider to be more successful in accomplishing the initial goal of making texture-based music.
