Kozaks of Metallishtan (also sometimes abbreviated as KOM) is the Bestest (and probably the only) Polkka-Metal band from Metallishtan. Metallishtan as a nation was occupied by the Soviet Russia, and due to heavy Russifinication (Ick!) its geographic whereabouts are nowadays quite obscure.

Kozaks of Metallishtan consists of three Metallishtan men:

General Petrovsky:  Balalaika and vocals
Igor Ivanovitsch :  Bass balalaika and vocals
Karpov Markov    :  Bongos, Rocks and other hittable objects that say "bang"

Former members and affiliations:

Mihail           :  Deported to Siberia
Don Panno        :  Famous Sicilian mobster
