Obscure, mysterious underground black metal project from Lappeenranta, Finland, very little information on Rautavaris is available. Three demo tapes have been released so far, first two unnamed tapes by the band in 2004 and 2005 and the most recent "Suden Lapset" by Grievantee, an underground label run by Horna's Shatraug, in March 2008. On the first two tapes the band plays atmospheric, melancholic and folk-tinged black metal while on the latest tape the approach is raw black metal.

The second song from "Suden Lapset" is available on the band's Mikseri.net page. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rautavaris">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
