Franz Kafka (3 July 1883 - 3 June 1924) was one of the major writers of the 20th century. He was born to a middle-class Jewish, German speaking family in Prague, Czechia. His unique body of writing - much of which is incomplete and was published posthumously - is among the most influential in Western literature.

His stories, such as The Metamorphosis (1915), and novels, including The Trial (1925) and The Castle (1926), concern troubled individuals in a nightmarishly impersonal and bureaucratic world. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Franz+Kafka">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
