Biography
Kitezh used to go by Barnacle. That band existed for around two years, and experienced some lineup changes. Kitezh is currently commited to providing intense metal to those that wish to listen. The Bible is a fable re-written by those that have held power enough to have spun such a needlessly irrelevant tale. Kitezh is invisible.
