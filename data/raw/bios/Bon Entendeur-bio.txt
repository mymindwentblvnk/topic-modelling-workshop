From shared passions was born an extraordinary project: Bon Entendeur. A duo in love with French culture and curious to invent hybrid formats fed by their passions. The result: Aller-retour. A cluster of beautiful ideas gathered in a unique album. 

Their adventure starts with a rather classical approach: arranging playlists fed with music they like. They gradually added what would become their trademark: the grain of a personality's voice on mixed music. Their format is declined during 5 years, 40 mixtapes, more than 70 million listening. A quality signature. Bon Entendeur has this desire to talk about culture in its original version. This sense of aestheticism, of appropriateness. And of the stage. Behind the turntables, they mix their tributes and move the packed halls on a very fine sound. They also have the audacity to never run out of ideas, and in 2015 they offered their first revisit of a song from the 70s, Le temps est bon. A success.

Their album Aller-Retour concentrates their DNA: it is composed of revisited songs from the 60s and 70s and original productions mixed with interviews. All elegantly arranged in 14 tracks. Bon Entendeur creates sounds that are new, that go back and forth with their inventive digital generation and the immense heritage of their predecessors. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bon+Entendeur">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
