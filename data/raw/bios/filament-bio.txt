There is more than one artist with this name:
1. An onkyo experimental band from Japan
2. An American electronica/indie rock band from Detroit, Michigan.

1. Filament, consists of former Ground Zero members Otomo Yoshihide and Sachiko M, two of the defining artists of the onkyo music movement. In contrast to the dense, "chopped up", genre-hopping style of Ground Zero, Filament explores minimalist free-improvisation, concerned often with narrow-variations in tone and timbre usually without rhythmic structure or more than the slightest fragments of melody.

Otomo and Sachiko M played as a duo for the first time on November 5, 1995 at the LMC concert in London; but it was not until 1997 that they started playing duo often, as one of their major projects. At first they called their duo A-102; then they used both Filament and A-102, and occasionally simply "duo," with no specific project name. Since their U.S.-France concert tour of May '98, they have used the name Filament exclusively.

2. Filament is an electronica/rock band that was formed in Detroit, Michigan in early 2007 by James, Brandon, and Tim. Filament once started out as a small garage band, and has now evolved into an electronic rock sensation. The anticipated release of their first mainstream album "Futuristic Love Letter" has been scheduled to be released sometime Summer 2010.
