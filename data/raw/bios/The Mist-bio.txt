Thrash Metal from Belo Horizonte, Brazil. The band was originally known as Mayhem before later changing their name to The Mist in 1988 following several line-up changes. In 1989 they released their debut album, Phantasmagoria featuring Vladimir Korg of Chakal on vocals and boasted a twin guitar line-up displaying a progressive mix of aggressive thrash and gothic atmosphere. Over the next 18 months, the band lost both its guitarists (including the death of Reinaldo "Caval√£o" Bedran) who were solely replaced by Jairo Guedz, original guitarist for Sepultura, reducing the band to a four-piece. In 1991 the band released their second album, The Hangman Tree further expanding the unique sound of the debut. After this album, Korg left the band leaving The Mist to continue on as a trio with bassist Marcello Diaz taking over vocals for 1993's Ashes To Ashes, Dust To Dust with the band adopting a more contemporary groove-metal/post-thrash sound in the process. In 1995 the band released their fourth and final release, Gottverlassen, marking the loss of their final original member, Diaz, who was replaced by Cassiano Gobbet on both bass and vocals. Remaining long-term member Guedz signed with Overdose in early 1997; originally a temporary replacement for guitarist Sergio C., he later agreed to join the band on a permanent basis, dissolving The Mist in the process. Marcello Diaz went on to join Max Cavalera's Soulfly the same year, adopting the stage-name Marcello D Rapp. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Mist">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
