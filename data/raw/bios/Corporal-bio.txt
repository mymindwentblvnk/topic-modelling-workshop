Overdriven folk-core ditties delivered with gritty acoustic guitar strums, like an ice cream social in the belly of the whale. Sometimes a soft number. The Replacements meets Steely Dan.

Michael Shannon has been writing music since his teens. His guitar, voice and lyrics are the heart and spirit of this American-made album. Multi-instrumentalist/producer Ray Rizzo has been playing in and recording bands for 15 years and provides backbone as drummer and harmonica player. The album also contains musical contributions from guitarist Robert Beitzel and engineer/bassist Kevin Meeker. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Corporal">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
