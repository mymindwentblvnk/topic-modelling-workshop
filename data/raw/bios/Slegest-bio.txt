Slegest is the solo project of former Vreid guitarist Ese. Formed in 2010, it was the intention of Ese to create Black Sabbath inspired music with harsh vocals. An idea he took further, developing Slegest into the entity it is today with its rock-orientated sound distinguished by a distinctive Black Metal edge.

Slegest’s first release was the self-titled 2012 EP, which appeared as both a digital release and as a 7” vinyl on Ese’s own label Systrond Recordings. In late 2012 Slegest started preparing a full length album and in May 2013 the band signed with Dark Essence records and they released the début album "Løyndom" in October 2013.
