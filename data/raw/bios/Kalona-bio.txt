Kalona, meaning "Raven" in the Cherokee language, is an atmospheric black metal band established in March 2011 in NE Ohio, USA. It is comprised of one member, Lord Gloom, noted for being the frontman of Afterlight and for having a guest appearance on Fragments of Unbecoming's "Sterling Black Icon" album (Metal Blade Records). Gloom writes and records all instruments himself in an attempt to recreate the chaos he holds within. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kalona">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
