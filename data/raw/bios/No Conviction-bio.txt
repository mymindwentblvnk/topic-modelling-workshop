Hailing from the Chicago suburbs, No Conviction has been pounding out their own hybrid of metal infused with hardcore nation-wide since 2007. Their high energy stage presence and fast growing fan base has landed them opening slots with bands such as Hatebreed, GODSMACK, DEFTONES and more. A self-titled demo album sold quickly, and after teaming up with Moralless Records, No Conviction released their debut album "Assassination of the American Dream" in March 2009, along with a video for the song "Bury the Living", directed by legendary Franky Nasso. After 2 years of various shows and a short tour as the opener for Powerman 5000, they are currently working on a new album, H.A.T.E. (Highly Aggressive Toward Everyone), which promises to surpass any previous release and live up to its name
