Untermensch. 80's anarcho-punk combo from the wild North-West of England.
Angry, articulate, and anti-pretty much everything. The patron stains of lost causes -fighting tories, oppression, unemployment, exploitation and state control armed only with a fist full of lyrics, hearts as big as lions and thirty-quid guitars.

If bands had hits based on sheer passion, Untermensch would have been the poster-popster boys of a generation. As it was - like all catalysts- they burned brightly for a short time and left a rather nasty skid mark across the face of the UK punk scene,

Line-up: Marko Hodz (guitar), DT (Bass), Rob T (drums), T. Leaves (keyboards), Slim Jim (vocals).
