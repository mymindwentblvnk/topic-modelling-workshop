Ramrod is a punk rock band from Bowie, Maryland. Straight-up punk rock with talented musicians who aren't afraid to show that they're actually adept at playing their instruments. Tightly formed songs, shifting speeds, and strong vocals in the vein of Bigwig, Propaghandi, and Lagwagon. Recently off of their summer tour, and soon to be releasing their new full length record "Joy of Elaborate Yawning" they show no sign of slowing down.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ramrod">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
