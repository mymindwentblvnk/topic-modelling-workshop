Enabler from Milwaukee are a terrifying collision of metal, crust and hardcore punk. They batter with a lethal methodical precision that completely flattens everything in their wake. They have previously released several recordings on tape, lp etc.. But, All Hail the Void can for all intents and purposes be called their debut. It was recorded by guitarist Greg Thomas (Misery Signals, Shai Hulud, The Risk Taken). Enabler drummer is none other than Andy Hurley (Fallout Boy, The Damned Things, Earth Crisis).

Enabler was abruptly ended when it came to light that frontman Jeff Lohrber is a serial abuser. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Enabler">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
