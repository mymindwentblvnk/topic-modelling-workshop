There are two bands registered under the name 11th Dimension.

1) A progressive metal band from Lisbon, Portugal

11th Dimension is a four piece progressive metal / post-metal project from Lisbon, Portugal. The band was officially launched in July 2013, however, the project had been brewing since early 2011 when the four members, that have met in another project, decided to quit and continue by themselves.

After the end of that project, they had an almost 3 years long run on the covers band circuit, where they grew their synergy and stage experience, truly transforming into a band.

Although all four members revolve around the metal scene in their musical tastes, the mix of musical backgrounds is one of the most interesting aspects of the band. In each song one can find traces of everything, from death and epic metal to rock and electronica; the most predominant trace, however, is the modern wave of progressive and post-metal bands.

2014 is marked by the release of their first EP entitled Odyssey. The songs were recorded, mixed and mastered by the band, in what was both a fulfilling and didactic adventure, and an exercise in stubbornness, which vouches for the band’s objective of being as untainted as they can, without sacrificing the quality of what they deliver to their fans.
