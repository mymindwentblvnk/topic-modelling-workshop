In 1992, two sets of brothers, namely Joey & Ben and Shem & Luke, teamed up to create Soy Bomb. For over a year they wrote new music and played live shows in Tampa, FL. The year culminated in the recording of several of their original songs, most of which were lost in the great harddrive crash of '03. The tracks that remained were released on the album Interesting Yet Not Productive. Soon thereafter the band disbanded, and Say It Again Lucas arose from it's ashes. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/sOy+bOmb">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
