Harriette Pilbeam (born 4 May 1993), known professionally as Hatchie, is an Australian singer-songwriter and musician. She released her debut EP, Sugar & Spice, in 2018.

She started singing as a child, later learning guitar and bass in her teen years, as well as piano and clarinet. She studied entertainment, music, and management in college before pursuing live music as a creative outlet. She's the bassist and vocalist of the indie rock band Babaganouj, as well as a former member of the band Go Violets, which disbanded in 2014.

Pilbeam made her solo debut under the name Hatchie, a nickname she got from her parents, with the release of her debut single "Try" in May 2017. The single gained her significant attention in her native Australia. She then signed with Ivy League Records and released her second single "Sure" in November 2017. In January 2018, she also signed with Double Double Whammy and Heavenly Recordings. In February 2018, "Sure" was remixed by Cocteau Twins' guitarist Robin Guthrie. She released two more singles, "Sugar & Spice" and "Sleep", before releasing her debut EP Sugar & Spice on 25 May. The EP consists of the four previously released singles as well as one additional track, titled "Bad Guy". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hatchie">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
