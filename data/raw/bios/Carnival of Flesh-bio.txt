The Beginning 2002 - 2008
The story of Carnival of Flesh starts in late 2002, when two guys, Dachaz and Dam, wanted to reshape the Serbian black metal scene with a sound that escapes the traditional black metal boundaries. This sound was commonly described as a refreshing mix of heavier guitars and more mind-blowing symphonies than usual.
Due to frequent personnel changes, the desired sound was not reached, and the band officially split up in 2008.

Storytelling era 2014 - 2018
Carnival of Flesh was rebooted as a studio project. Over the course of  2014., the perfect conditions were created for recording: Some of the best songs from the past were hand-picked from the vault, their arrangements were updated, lyrics conceptually rewritten and some of the best personnel was engaged. Thus, “Stories From a Fallen World” were born. In 2015., “Stories From a Fallen World” was released both as a deluxe digipak edition and via digital distribution channels. A year later, the band finally got its full form again and they deliver a stunning performance on the "Storytelling" event in Belgrade. To announce their European tour, Carnival of Flesh appeared on two warmup shows in Belgrade: with Rossomahaar and with Welicoruss. The tour, labelled “Storytelling across Europe”, took place in 14 European cities during October of 2018.

Anthems era 2019 - 2021
A year after the tour, the band met again and put together the sketch of the next album. Fuelled by profound misanthropy and driven by humanity's hunger for environmental and social decay, they forge the opus that truly is a sign of the times. “Anthems of Extinction”, was recorded in mid-2021. and released in November of the same year, followed by a local tour. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Carnival+of+Flesh">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
