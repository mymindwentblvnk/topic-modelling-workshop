Times Have Changed was a death/thrashmetalband hailing from the South of The Netherlands. Starting out as a hardcore band, the style changed during the years to a mix of death and thrash metal. 

During the years various members came and went, and work began on the recording of an album. After the recordings were finished however the line-up changed again due to one member's immigration to the UK. This in the end lead to the decision to break up the band, but not before finalizing and releasing the album. 

In 2011 the full-length album The Dark Behind The Eye was released, leading to a final show in the album line-up and with some special performances from old band members.

The final line-up was:
Luc - vocals
Casper - guitar
Barry - guitar
Dennis - bass
Sylvy - drums <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Times+have+Changed">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
