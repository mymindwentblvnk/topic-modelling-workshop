Lightning Dust is a Canadian indie rock band formed in 2007 in Vancouver as a side project of Amber Webber and Joshua Wells, both members of Black Mountain. 

Webber and Wells have been playing together for many years as part of Black Mountain. The two decided to start a separate project together that they named Lightning Dust.

Committing themselves to a more simplistic approach with Lightning Dust, Webber and Wells also decided to escape the comforts of their familiar instruments and writing styles. On their self-titled debut, minimal and spacious arrangements and a moody, theatrical vocal-style aptly expose the demons, creating songs that creep into your bones with a haunting chill.

Their debut album was recorded in a dank cave and a bright blue house, perhaps an unconscious yet obsessive protest of the sunny beach and beer world that surrounded them on the outside. Many of the songs on this self-titled debut began years ago as melodies which persistently floated around in Webber's head. 

Another album, Infinite Light, was released in August 2009. The band performed at Matt Groening's All Tomorrow's Parties festival in May 2010 in Minehead, England.

A third album, Fantasy, which featured synthesized music, drumming, some industrial instrumental work, all accompanying the band's spooky songs, was released June 25, 2013. This album included the song "Loaded Gun"; in 2014 it was used in French television series SÃ©rie Noire, on SRC. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lightning+Dust">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
