From Melbourne, Australia, Beaches are Antonia Sellbach (Love of Diagrams) on guitar and vocals, Alison Bolger (Panel of Judges) on guitar and vocals, Ali McCann on guitar and vocals, Gill Tucker (Spider Vomit) on bass and vocals and Karla Way on drums and vocals.

Their debut, self-titled album, released in November 2008, 'reflects the shared musical loves of Beaches, from 1960s hit parades to 1970s psychedelia, shoegaze to prog, southern boogie to krautrock.' <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Beaches">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
