Royal Bangs are an American music group from Knoxville, TN. Formed in 2005, the trio is composed of Chris Rusk (drums), Ryan Schaefer (keyboard, vocals, electronics), and Sam Stratton (guitar). Royal Bangs released their debut LP We Breed Champions in 2008 through Audio Eagle Records, an independent record label founded and run by Patrick Carney of The Black Keys. The following year, German label City Slang released the album in Europe where British music magazine Uncut described the record as "belting garage rock, quirky indie rock and bamboozling electronica, all served up in one smart and super-confident package, rather like a chirpier, younger, less navel-gazing Radiohead."  

They released Let It Beep in 2009, on Audio Eagle Records in the US and City Slang in Europe.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Royal+Bangs">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
