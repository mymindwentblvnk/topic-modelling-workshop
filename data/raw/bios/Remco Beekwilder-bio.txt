Fairly new to the scene, but already way ahead of his game. With his signature sound, clearly rooted in nostalgia, the Dutchman quickly marked his own place in the electronic scene.

Early 2018 he kicked of his label EMERALD with his Nightlife EP. The Dutchman humbly pushes foward his vision of electronic music whilst trying to stay loyal to the rave. EMERALD 001 is themed with eerie, rave influences and his unmistakeable, warehouse-built kick drums.

His monumental LSD EP got released on Dax J's Monnom Black label and shows his diversity and capability as a producer, with four tracks that reflect his artistry perfectly. The long awaited LSD track reached No.34 into the DJ Mag top 50 tracks of 2017.

In 2016 Beekwilder’s 10th Planet EP got released on self reflektion and gained huge support from artists (Dax J, Marcel Dettmann, Luke Slater and Rebekah) and fans alike. Basement Tools EP on the same label got support from artists like Ben Sims, Paula Temple, Ø [Phase] and Dave Clark amongst others. In February of this year he released the State of Return EP on Binary Cells. A1 track 'Planet Acid' got featured in the Berghain 08 mix for Ostgut Ton.

Next to producing the Dutchman has been playing at some of the biggest clubs and events such as Awakenings, Reaktor, Rotterdamse Rave, Soenda, Kompass Club and Tresor. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Remco+Beekwilder">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
