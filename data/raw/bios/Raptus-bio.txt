2 different artists with the name Raptus:

1) Raptus is a glitch-hop producer from the UK. 
Having already achieved local mythical status amongst fellow underground DJ and Producers of Cornwall in the UK, Rewan Leach a.k.a. Raptus, who has been producing and mixing since 2008 is fast becoming an internationally recognized figure in the Dubstep community. With a healthy amount of releases already under his belt, Raptus has attracted the attention of many labels including the well respected 'Adapted Records'. 
While Raptus has been dominating his local underground EDM scene playing at most important events such as Crasken, Jericho and Acid Bath, he has a multitude of larger events ahead of him, and not just in Cornwall, but in the rest of the world. Raptus has played alongside some of the most prestigious names in the business, including DatsiK, Stenchman and Koan Sound.
