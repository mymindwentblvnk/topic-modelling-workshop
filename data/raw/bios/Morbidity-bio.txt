There’s at least two different bands with this name:

1.) Swedish Black Metal band.
2.) Swedish Death/Thrash Metal band.
3.) Russian/Buryat Grindcore band.
4.) Bangladeshi Old School Death Metal Band

1.) The blackmetal pluton Morbidity was formed in late 2004 by the lead guitarist Anders, shortly there after Gabriel joined the band. Johan (also in Digerdöd) was summoned as well to handle the bass and vocals. Joppe joined the band as a guitarist, but after some time he left the band for personal reasons. After a while the band got in contact with Erik who handles the other axe, since a year back. Morbidity finally took shape. With the new and stable line-up the band started writing songs for an upcoming recording. A few minor gigs was also done in the area around Örebro.

In the beginning of 2007 the band entered Garden of Deceased studio in Örebro to record their debutdemo, together with engineerer and co-producer Tommy Bruhn. Four songs produced was the result. The demo was later entitled "Towards A Frozen Time".

2.) Morbidity was a Death/Thrash Metal band from Linköping, Sweden formed in 1988.
The band featured Ztephan "Dark" Karlsson on bass.

3.) Grindcore band from Ulan-ude (Republic of Buryatia, Russian Federation).

4.) Morbidity is an old school death metal band hailing from the realms of the mighty Bengal. Formed in the last days of 2010. Morbidity intends on resurrecting the rawness of pure old school death metal. As a band Morbidity aims for nothing but to put forward skullcrushing death metal for all the true blood of the horde. Their first demo tape "Pits of Eternal Torment" was released in 2012 which got very positive views from the critics of death metal.   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Morbidity">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
