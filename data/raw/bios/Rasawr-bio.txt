RASAWR is a death/grind band from the north of the Netherlands, started by Bas Jansen (previously in Bowel Rupture) and Mark Hendriks ( Existence Denied, ex-Bowel Rupture and ex-Hedera Helix). After a short search two guitar players were added to the line-up, Martin Wolters (previously in Grinroth and Hedera Helix) and Martin Vogel (bass in Fumes of Decay), as well as a bass player/vocalist, Fokke Hofstra (Ex-Open). In 2006 Mark quit the band to concentrate on his studies. His replacement for drums is Henk Scherphof, who also plays in Sanguinary and Fumes Of Decay. http://www.myspace.com/rasawr <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/RasawR">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
