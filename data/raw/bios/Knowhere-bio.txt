Knowhere is a hybrid black metal band from Switzerland founded in October 1992 by Zappi (guitars, effects), Kov (vocals, drums), Philippe (guitars) and Dany (bass). The original style of the band was grindcore. It soon became varied black metal. The lyrics of Knowhere are neither political nor religious.

Their first CD "Knowhere" was released in fall 1997. The album contained four atmospheric black metal songs which had been recorded in Knowhere's own studio. 

Dany left the band in October 1998, however, Knowhere found session bass players for their live concerts. In fall 1999, Arlette "Eiselfe" H.D. joined the band as their new bass player and created the necessary basslines on a keyboard. After a couple of months she replaced the keys with a 5-string bass guitar and thus the Knowhere line-up was complete again.

After some concerts with larger audiences and lots of positive feedback, Philippe decided to quit the band due to lack of time. He was later replaced by Fuhli, who brought new energy into Knowhere's music.
  
In Spring 2001, the recordings for the second CD "The Mascot" started. The album was recorded in Knowhere's own studio, however, the end mix and mastering was completed in a professional sound lab/recording studio. The result of this work was released on the 9th of January 2004.
