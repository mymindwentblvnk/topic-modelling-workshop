Demise Empire was originally formed in 2002 by Arthur Schaufler (guitar), Eugen Rutz (vocals) and Sergej Polyanin (drums). In spring 2004 Matthias Schulz (bass) joined the band. Just, as Arthur decided to leave the band in the year 2004, David Ludwig (guitar) joined Demise Empire.

In September 2005, the first live-gig was performed in Essen, with a still incomplete line-up, consisting of Sergej P., Eugen R. and David L.. At this time, Matthias was taking a break from Demise Empire, to focus on his studies.

Despite the absence of a bass and a second guitar, this first gig was very successful and strengthened and motivated the band, to go on with what they were doing.

Finally, in March 2006 the line-up was completed for the first time. Matthias came back and Andrej Paschchenko (guitar) joined Demise Empire.

In the end of the year 2006, a demo with 4 songs was recorded and presented on myspace. ( www.myspace.com/demiseempiremyspace ). While this demo has been used to apply for more live gigs, the recording phase for the first full-length album got initialised in December 2006. The recording was done by Padlo (www.padlo.de) and completed in May 2007 in Duisburg. This first CD, entitled “Unholy Grail” was finally released on Oct., 19th 2007, during a concert in Ratingen. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Demise+Empire">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
