1. Sisyphus is the new name for the collaboration between Serengeti, Son Lux, and Sufjan Stevens (formerly s / s / s), whose new project under this moniker is a self-titled album partly inspired by the art of Jim Hodges, and commissioned by the Walker Art Center and The Saint Paul Chamber Orchestraâ€™s Liquid Music series in Minneapolis/Saint Paul. 

2. An Invisible Records employee created a disc of dark ambient music to compliment the movie: The Blair Witch Project in 1999. The CD was entitled "Greetings from Burkittsville" and was released the same year by his employer.

3. 3 piece post-hardcore band from Vancouver, BC with Revolution Summer type vibe, but weirder. In the vein of Gray Matter, Rites Of Spring, Embrace, M-Blanket, etc. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sisyphus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
