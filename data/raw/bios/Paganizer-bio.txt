Paganizer is the brainchild of the Swedish death metal-mastermind Roger "Rogga" Johansson.  Starting as a four-piece in late 1998 with the intent of playing old school death/thrash metal. Paganizer's music in the early stage transcribed as thrash metal (debut album "Deadbanger"), but with their second album release in 2001 with "Promoting Total Death", the band moved towards death metal-assault. Highly old school death metal-themed, inspiration and homage is paid to the roots of old death metal branches and legends. 

Rogga and the other members are also involved with Ribspreader. Johansson composes most of the music and writes all the lyrics for both bands.  Brand new CD EP "Born to be Buried Alive" out now on Asphyxiate Recordings from Australia. All new studio tracks, 1 live track and a bonus "hidden" video!
