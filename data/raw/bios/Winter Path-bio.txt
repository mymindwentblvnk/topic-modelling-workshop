Winter Path was formed as a band by Lord Vintergoth (guitars,vocals) in 2001, in Athens.The band confronted many problems trying to find a stable line-up, with Lord Vintergoth and Asmodeus (drums) being the basic members, writing some songs which were going to be released in the first demo of the group, but problems with some members prevented this from happening. A couple of years went by and the band had finally established a suitable line-up, with Vomitor (guitar) and Grimfrost (bass guitar) joining the band in the late summer of 2003. With this line-up,the band spent plenty of time rehearsing and recorded a rehearsal tape titled "rehearsal 2003" and a promo tape titled "rehearsal promo tape 2003". In 2004, the group apart from rehearsing, finally recorded its first demo cd in August 2004 and released it in October 2004. The demo was entitled "Open the Gates to Engrave the Path" and was a self-financed release. The line-up of the demo was: Lord Vintergoth - vocals/lead guitar, Vomitor - rythm guitar, Grimfrost - bass guitar and Asmodeus - drums. During 2004 and 2005, the band gave some live shows across Greece and Vomitor, who left the band, was replaced by another guitarist. The band is currently working on new songs and has already written songs which are going to be soon released in the 2nd demo.
