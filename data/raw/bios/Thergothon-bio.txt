Thergothon were a Finnish funeral doom band.  Along with other acts like dISEMBOWELMENT, Skepticism, Mordor (Che), Lord of Putrefaction and Winter they pioneered the style in the early 1990's and influenced many of the bands that came afterwards and developed the style further.

The band's groundbreaking sound is a combination of very slow and heavy death metal influenced doom metal, deep growls and eerie, drawn guitar leads. The lyrics are obscure, with influences from H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu mythos.

Thergothon released only one album and a demo before splitting up, along with various unreleased material (some of which can be found on certain sites on the internet).

- Stream From the Heavens (CD), 1994
