"Arising from the sweltering heat that has been burning down Los Angeles, one band seems to have the antidote. ENTICE, an Orange County based quartet has been turning heads with their appropriately titled album LET THE FIRE COME. The tracks carry over a relief of heavy, yet tranquil melodies that set the tone for a variety of publics to enjoy.

Recorded at Orange Crush Studio with producer Scott Silletta, LET THE FIRE COME exasperates the efforts of the hard working band and reaches a level of professionalism that promises to astonish even the toughest critics.

The self-proclaimed singles “The Watchman” and “Who’s Got Your Money” have gained Entice a spot amongst the Alternative and Active Rock-Pop genres. The songs carry through mature lyrics and notions that fall above love, lust and heartbreak. “The gentle rock melodies of Entice are a breath of fresh air in a superficial, plastic world that wants everything fast, hard, and loud” (www.Drivenfaroff.com). There is no question about these guys gaining support to potentially fit in with various radio formats. With every track out-doing the next, LET THE FIRE COME holds its weight in gold, yet Entice truly is all about the music. In accordance with the album release, all eleven songs are available for review via MySpace. It’s no contest; this meticulous foursome is working overtime to establish something they refer to as “building a legacy, an empire-undivided.”" <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Entice">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
