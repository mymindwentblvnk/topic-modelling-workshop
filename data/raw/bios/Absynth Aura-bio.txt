A rock-pumping heart
The power of a modern sound
A warm voice with Soul nuances
No ordinary choices

Different souls bonded by their will to develop a very special musical project.
The words they sing are deeply intimate and sincere. Infinite grace and strong power unite in a crossover of rock and melody, sometimes revealing a pop soul.
Klod, Dr.Viossy, Jt and Mark got together to play “their” Music, both unusually powerful and rich, with a special pervasive atmosphere that carries the listener into an emotional vortex.
A gaze into the future.
