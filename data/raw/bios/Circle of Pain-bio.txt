"Circle of Pain" were originally formed in early 1994 in Heppenheim / Germany under the less desirable name Tipsy Slut. Prior to the more appropriate January 2001 name change, the band managed to accumulate a host of noteworthy achievements countrywide.
In the fall of 1996, the band embarked on their first nation-wide tour, which, prior to it's conclusion in 1997, included the much-coveted opportunity to perform as support act for "The Sweet", "AXXIS" and "SAXON".
In January 2001, "Circle of Pain" commenced working together with a choir and orchestra on material from "Paradox of Destitution" which they recently presented at a Gala Concert held in Wiesbaden's Rhein-Main Theatre. A 48-track live sound and video recording was made of this enormously successful event, released on VHS-Video in Autumn 2001. Visibly impressed by Circle of Pain's show were the fans of superstar rock band "The Scorpions" - who also performed at the Gala Concert - evident in newspaper headlines such as "Circle Of Pain steal the show away from the Scorpions."
