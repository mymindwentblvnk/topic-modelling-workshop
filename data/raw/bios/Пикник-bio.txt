Пикник (/pɪkˈnɪk/, "picnic" in Russian) is a Russian art rock/gothic rock band founded in 1978 in Leningrad, Soviet Union (now Saint Petersburg, Russian Federation), the band has been led by the vocalist/guitarist Edmund Shklyarsky since 1981.
Unusual arrangements, self-invented musical instruments and esoteric lyrics make the band a completely unique occurrence in the Russian rock music genre. Lyrics contain themes such as Ancient Egypt, vampires and mysticism. Shklyarsky is the band's main singer-songwriter, composing both music and lyrics. Also his own paintings were used as few albums' cover art.
Пикник's logo is a made up kanji-like symbol (which makes more sense for Russian speakers as Chinese/Japanese as well as Ancient Egyptian characters are all called "hieroglyphs" in Russian language).
