Brutal-Aggressive-Straightforward-Volatile

All fitting words to describe Detroit, Michigan's four-piece death metal outfit known as Writhing.

With a line up consisting of drummer Greg Mastin, bassist Michael Nastasy, guitarist Don Durr, and vocalist Matt DePlancke, the band collectively shares one common goal: Deliver a crushing and intense death metal assault.

Creating a sound more akin to classic acts such as Deicide and Malevolent Creation, as opposed to many of their contemporaries, Writhing takes the genre back to its roots while simultaneously bringing forth elements of thrash, grind, and doom. Expect down-tuned riffing, blistering blast-beats and battered eardrums. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Writhing">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
