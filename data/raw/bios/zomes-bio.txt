Zomes is a new solo project by Asa Osborne (Lungfish, The Pupils, Tear Jerks). 

For Zomes' self-titled 2008 debut, Asa strung together a number of misshapen lo-fi loops and miniatures across an album that references Vincent Gallo-style rundown melancholy, stargazing kraut rock, and a selection of organ-driven passages that bring to mind a miniaturized Religious Knives. Osborne is at his best on pieces like 'Night Signs', a beautiful, hiss-coated guitar phrase, repeated in a sombre, ambiguous fashion over a couple of minutes. It makes no associations or attempts at narrative, but there's undoubtedly something quite moving embedded within its diminutive frame. Elsewhere Osborne gets rocking a little harder, marrying overdriven chord sequences with rowdy, furniture bashing beats on the likes of 'Crowning Orbs' and the progged up 'All Together'.

"Earth Grid," Zomes' second LP, came out in 2011.
