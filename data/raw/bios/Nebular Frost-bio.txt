Formed in late 2005 by Bran (guitar/vocals), Lord Brew (bass) and Isbre (drums), Nebular Frost have spent the past 3 years creating music that can be described as 'a subtle groove under a blizzard of evil'. 

So far they have released 1 demo, 1 rehersal cd and a split with fellow UKBM bands Morkem and Arawn. 

As of early 2010 Nebular Frost have parted ways with both Isbre and Brew. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nebular+Frost">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
