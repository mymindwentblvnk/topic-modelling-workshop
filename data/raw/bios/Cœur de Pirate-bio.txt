Cœur de pirate (French for "pirate heart") is the stage name for Béatrice Martin (born September 22, 1989), a Canadian singer-songwriter from Montréal, Québec, Canada. She writes and sings mainly French songs and is sometimes attributed to Nouvelle Chanson.

Béatrice has played the piano since the age of three, which was initiated by her mother, a professional pianist. She later played as a keyboardist in the post-hardcore band December Strikes First when she was 15 years old. In March 2007, after five years of music education, she started composing her own songs. 

After a brief stint as keyboardist for Bonjour Brumaire, a French-Canadian Indie Rock/Indie Pop band, she released her solo debut album Cœur de pirate in 2008 on the Québécois independent record label Grosse Boîte. The album found much critical acclaim and was subsequently nominated for Francophone Album of the Year at the 2009 Juno Awards. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/C%C5%93ur+de+Pirate">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
