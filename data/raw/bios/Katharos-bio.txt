There is more than one artist with this name:

1. With a desire to create a symphonic black metal influenced by orchestral arrangements without interrupting the power within black and death metal, Katharos was founded in mid-autumn 2006 by Christofer Sköld, Richard Annerhall and Martin Müssbichler. The present line-up was closed shortly afterwards with the entrance of Max Müssbichler. As the material for the “De Cinere”-demo started to manifest, several drummers were tried out. But none seemed to fit the needs of Katharos; and so Katharos still strives to fulfil the line-up with a drummer. The demo: “De Cinere”, was therefore entirely recorded using programmed drums. Katharos is currently arranging their new material which is planned to be released in autumn 2007.

2. Instrumental sludge/doom metal from Germany
