Lycanthoropy were a short lived Scottish band from Dunfermline, who mainly played a style of thrash metal influenced by death metal, much like that of the very early works of Cannibal Corpse and Sepultura. The only ever played one gig, and after a year running (2007-2008) changed their name to Demon-Stration after original vocalist Chris Lynch left.

During there year of activity, they released two demos, An Experiement In Homicide, which showed a mainly thrash influence, and Gore Project, which could be described as death metal with grindcore influence. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lycanthoropy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
