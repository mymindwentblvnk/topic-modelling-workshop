GOREFIELD is an intense 3 piece Metal band from the Sunshine Coast in Queensland, Australia.

Formed in late 2010, GOREFIELD's musical style encompasses everything true to original old school Heavy Metal, whilst incorporating many modern influences and compositional techniques.

GOREFIELD's extreme metal masterpieces are constructed to push the very boundaries of what a mere 3 piece Metal band can achieve, including complex instrumental passages, progressive tempo changes and colourful melodies.

GOREFIELD have already composed a number of impressive original tracks that have been included on their recently released debut LP, '2013 - As Dawn Bleeds The Sky'.

Current lineup:
BJ - Bass (2011-present)
Danyn Andrews - Drums (2011-present)
Kurt Tickle - Guitars, Vocals (2011-present)
