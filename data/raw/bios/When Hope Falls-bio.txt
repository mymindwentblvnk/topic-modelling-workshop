WHEN HOPE FALLS, this new Melodeath/Melodeathcore band from STRÖMSTAD has now come to stay. The band started back in 2005 under the name IMAGINATION by the three friends Magnus Fredman, Ozzy Sjöström and Tony Nilsson. In 2006 they were joined by the guitarist Arthur Börjeson and the whole show was on. In early 2007 they lost their drummer Tony, but it was for the better as they now started to evolve quickly. The same year they were joined by Olle Swärd on bass and they recorded their first demo called FALLEN in G1 STUDIOS in Strömstad. Later that year they got joined by the drummer Ludvig Jacobsson (TRIPLE 6, SKANANA KIM). In early 2008 they entered the famous THE ABYSS STUDIO to record their new record called SHADOWS AND I with the producer Tommy Tägtgren (producer of bands as SABATON, MAZE OF TORMENT, SHINING etc.)

2008 is the year when WHEN HOPE FALLS is going to give it all out. No mercy is given from this angry band from Strömstad. It's now or never!
