The two original members, Tannoth-bassist turned guitarist- and Noclotron-guitarist-, were once a duet... later on Danalon joined and they became a power trio... the band later reformed with (Sorry Sam and Skyler I don't know your stage names...) Sam-drummer- and Skyler-bassist-... Danalon became a guitarist for another band after he was the drummer for Forest Of Grey... Their album is out and the next one is on the way... Check out Dissonant Planes over on Market & Leary Streets in Seattle, Washington. They will likely be one of the few places to sell most up and coming Black Metal and many other esoteric types of music as well. I am more than likely the biggest Forest Of Grey fan, in terms of how much I enjoy them.
One of my favorites is their song titled "Blood Frost", Check out their CD if you can find it!
I may be short and stocky, but I'm full of love for Forest Of Grey! among others... FOREST OF GREY RULES!
