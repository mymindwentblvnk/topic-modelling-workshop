Black Sheep Wall formed in 2006 in Moorpark, California. They play down tempo music influenced by many bands focusing on more minimalistic approaches (post-metal, sludge metal, drone doom, djent bands). The band named themselves after one of the cheat codes for one of the most played computer games of all time, StarCraft - an idea originally coined by the late Daniel Kraus of Admiral Angry (RIP). The band consists of Brandon Gillichbauer on bass and vocals, Scott Turner on guitar and Jackson Thompson on drums.

Thus far, the band has played with the likes of technical deathcore masters THE RED CHORD, prog/stoner legends BARONESS and metalcore legends CONVERGE. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Black+Sheep+Wall">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
