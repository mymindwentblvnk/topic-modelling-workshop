ARKAN, a death metal band, was born in May 2005 from the meeting between Abder (former member of Dawn of Decline) and Foued (former member of The Old Dead Tree) with a common goal : to mix "Metal" in the broadest sense and oriental music, a harmonious musical journey between the south and north.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Arkan">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
