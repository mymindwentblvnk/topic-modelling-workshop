Panteón Rococó is a mexican Latin-ska band formed in Mexico City, Mexico in 1995. Despite flourishing black markets, they sold thousands of records. While being stars in Mexico, they've been touring Europe the last three years in a row, especially Germany, where their European Label Übersee Records is located.

Panteón Rococó blend several styles of popular music such as rock, punk, salsa, cumbia, mariachi, reggae, ska, and also mestizo music into a very energetic, groovy sound. As they are very political people and sympathize with the EZLN in Chiapas, some of their lyrics contain political statements, but many others are love songs.

While very popular in Mexico, they are not so known in Europe, hence their contributions and tours there.
