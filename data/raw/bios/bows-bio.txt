Bows is actually a side project of Luke Sutherland, who was the singer/songwriter of the Scottish band, Long Fin Killie. Over the course of three albums, Sutherland performed music in a similar vein as groups like Baxter and Everything But The Girl - often blending elements of drum n bass with soft, melodic singing. As was the case in Long Fin Killie, the use of horns can be frequently heard in many of Sutherland's songs under his Bows alias as well as shared elements of delicacy not only in the vocals but also in the instrumentation. Sutherland is now one third of the electronic Music A.M. act. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bows">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
