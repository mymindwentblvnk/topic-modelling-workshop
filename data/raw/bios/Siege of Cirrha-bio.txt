Siege of Cirrha was founded in July 2006. After a long and hard search they found their fifth member, lead singer, in march 2007 and from this point on things became insane.
In the past one and a half years they played about thirty shows spread over the east of Austria.
People appreciate the mix of brutal hardcore and melodic metal and through the help of their fans, they were able to win the "America is waiting" bandcontest in the east of Austria, which brought them one step closer to their aim - getting better.   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Siege+of+Cirrha">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
