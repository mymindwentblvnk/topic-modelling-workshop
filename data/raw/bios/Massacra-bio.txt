Massacra was a French  death/thrash metal band formed in 1986 in Paris. Even if well received abroad, Massacra was ignored by most of the French metal press and promoters. After years of feud with Loudblast, at that time the most successful French death/thrash band in their own country, the two bands  did a common tour in France in the end of 1995. They split up as Fred Duval died of skin cancer on 6 June 1997. 

Jean-marc Tristani and Fred Duval released an indus/thrash-metal album in 1996 under the name Zero Tolerance. Tristani later became the Century Media representative in France.
