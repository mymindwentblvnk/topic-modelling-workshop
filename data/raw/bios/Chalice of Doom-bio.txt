Chalice of Doom is a melodic death doom metal band that was formed in Zarqa, Jordan in early 2010. The melodic visions and the doomy recordings have created a solid will to bring such music to Jordan, challenging the society and the misunderstanding of the atmospheric themes of this music. The number of fans of doom metal in the Middle East has really. Tracks like "Endless Prison" and "To Dust I Shall Return" inspired the band to create the debut album "Immemorial Nightfall" that has been released via Satanarsa Records.

Chalice of Doom's first performance in BLAST NIGHT II (24-08-2012 at Rainbow Theater - Amman) that has been organized by JOSCENE opened the door for a new era in the Jordanian scene since the local government has aborted many metal concerts and banned such events for years, letting the message of the band reach further limits and giving the members more inspiration to start writing new material.

In early 2013, the band signed with Spanish label Memento Mori who has also released their second album Into Hypnagogia.
