Declan Welsh and the Decadent West are a punk band with strong pop influences hailing from East Kilbride. Guaranteed to appeal to lovers of The Clash, they have supported artists including The Proclaimers, Ocean Colour Scene, Eddi Reader and Glasvegas. Welsh’s songwriting covers everyday frustrations, suburban boredom, social commentary and politics. Artists with genuine integrity and something to relevant to say, Welsh and band are a must see. Described by some as a modern amalgamation of Joe Strummer and Billy Bragg, Welsh certainly isn’t timid in challenging the political status quo himself.
Fortunately, he’s also got the songs to back it up. Recent tracks like ‘Nazi Boys’ and ‘Shiny Toys’ exhibit an indie rock band already reaching for stadium anthems, while ‘Useless’ showcases an emotional ballast to back it all up. Whether Welsh can change the world remains to be seen, but as a dynamic and ambitious songwriter, he’s throwing everything into it right now. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Declan+Welsh+and+The+Decadent+West">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
