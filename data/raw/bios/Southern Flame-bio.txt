Southern Flame is from Monroe County, WV. We started playing together as a "band" around March/April 2005. Our music is a fresh sounding mix between hard rock and metal. We play the kind of music that we like to listen to. There's probably no middle ground for our tunes...meaning you will love it or hate it. We believe in what we do and hope you enjoy watchin'/hearin' us do it. We ain't that Headbanger's Ball bullshit so if you dig the tunes they are passin' off as tunes these days then ya might as well keep on walkin'. We stand on our own feet and are tryin' to do somethin' different. In a world where everything is mass produced and shoved down your throat, we try to be that one thing that is actually respected as something worth having. So whether you love it or hate it, at least respect it cause it comes straight from the hands of people who do it for the love of raisin' their own brand of hell.
