The band Embraced by Hatred was born in spring 2002, first being just a project,
nameless and unserious. But after realizing what they created it became more and more crucial. It is hard to characterize their music but they would call it metal influenced beatdown. The songs are coined by a metal/nyhc styled riffing with heavy breakdowns and brutal moshparts. Their sound gets its own note by their two singers, who do from screaming and shouting up to rap like spoken words passages.Their lyrics are in english as well as german and dealing with personal experiences 
like treason and love up to drug abuse till faithfulness of family and friends.
The music speaks for itself, so create your own opinion.

In the past EBH shared stages with bands such as Cataract, Shattered Realm, Hoods,
Congress, End of Days, Settle the Score and Deadsoil, just to name a few..
2K6 they played on germany's infamous pressure fest and set the place to ashes.
