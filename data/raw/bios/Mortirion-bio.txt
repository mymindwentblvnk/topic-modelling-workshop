Mortirion is a Ambient  Experimental Black Metal band from Southport, UK
Mortirion formed in the summer of 2005 the shitty seaside resort of Southport, a town where nothing has ever happened and nothing ever will...Originally the brainchild of Guitarist and Vocalist Lord, the band came in to existance due to the lack of decient music in the area, being crappy Screamo bands or less than bog standard Death Metal which was the band-waggon every one and their dog was jumping on (they believed in shit and stand for even less)... ..Soon after Lord wrote some material he approached BaphoMatt, who was doing the rounds in a band called Dilacerate, BaphoMatt agreed to play drums and they started jamming in a friends basement, recording on a shitty tape player (see song - The Dead will walk the Earth)... Soon after Lord Moved away and rehersals were put on hold, two years later they started writing new material, but more problems plagued the writing process, mainly work and family commitments....... At the moment, Lord is writing lyrics and Guitar riffs and they try and get as much done as they can during pactice, the last song written 'Sacred Mendacity' will be featuring on the Legalize Murder 2 movie, and there is a potential split on the cards, with another Uk band called Blooddawn..  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mortirion">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
