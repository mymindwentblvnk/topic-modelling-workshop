Jahron Anthony Brathwaite (born July 3, 1993), better known under the stage name PARTYNEXTDOOR, is a Canadian singer from Mississauga who is signed to Drake's OVO Sound record label. 
PARTYNEXTDOOR had been making electronic dance music-infused R&B under his real name Jahron Brathwaite. His OVO Sound signing was announced with the unassuming song release of "Make a Mil" on Drake's October's Very Own blog. His first mixtape, PARTYNEXTDOOR, was released to the iTunes Store on July 1, 2013. It entered on the Billboard Heatseekers Albums chart at number six with sales of 2,000 copies and peaked at number 34 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart for the week ending July 20. He performed background vocals on "Own It" and "Come Thru" from Drake's third studio album, Nothing Was the Same. On August 26, 2013, "Over Here", featuring Drake, impacted urban contemporary radio as PARTYNEXTDOOR's debut single. In October 2013, he began touring with Drake, Future and Miguel on the "Would You like a Tour?" concert tour. 
Subsequently, PARTYNEXTDOOR released PARTYNEXTDOOR TWO and PNDCOLOURS in 2014 and PARTYNEXTDOOR 3 (P3) in 2016.
