1. BOOTS (born Jordy Asher) is a Soul and R&B producer, rapper, singer, songwriter, video director and multi-instrumentalist who first made forays into music as half of the musical duo Blonds, and into popular music as Beyoncé's producer.

After trying out a string of lesser-known groups including Blonds, Young Circles, Blond Fuzz and Stonefox, he signed to Jay Z's label Roc Nation in June 2013 to eventually release his original solo music. Boots' meteoric rise to fame came about when Beyoncé's self-titled album debuted at no. 1 on the charts, with 85% of the album featuring his production skills and four songs he'd written. Boots' debut solo album is the self-produced mixtape WinterSpringSummerFall.

2. Boots is one of the many pseudonyms of someone who is maybe named Robyn Nice who seems to release each new record under a new name. The Boots record was released in a box with LPs by C.C. and Snake & Remus. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Boots">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
