2) Nar was a Sacramento punk pop band featuring Scott Miller (The Bananas, Los Huevos, Bright Ideas) on guitar and vocals and sometimes bass, Jason Dezember (Bright Ideas) on bass, and sometimes guitar and vocals, and Ed Carroll (FM Knives, Los Huevos, Bright Ideas) on drums. Jason Dezember left the band in 1994 and Scott Maurer took over on bass. All of them except for Scott Maurer are also in The Ski Instructors. Nar formed in 1991 and had a final release in 1997 with the Four Song EP, although they did appear on another compilation in 1998, and possibly others. They were much different than the stereotypical Sacto pop punk bands; they were less drunk, more serious, but not completely serious.

They have a 40 song cd-r available which compiles tracks from vinyl & 4 track tapes - includes all the Nar singles, the split LP, compilation tracks, live songs, unreleased ones & rough mixes from the unfinished Nar LP. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nar">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
