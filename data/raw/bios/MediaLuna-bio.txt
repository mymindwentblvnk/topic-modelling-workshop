Founded in 2004, mediaLuna (formerly named as Sepia) is a progressive / psychedelic rock band with dynamic songs containing lots of melancholy and obscurity. The band consists of two guitar players, a bass player, a drummer, a vocal and hopefully a keyboard player. The band tries to use lots of oriental / turkish based rhytms and melodies. The band's purpose is to achieve an unpredictable yet distinctive sound. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/MediaLuna">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
