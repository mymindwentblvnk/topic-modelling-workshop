There are four artists known as Orfeo:

1. Orfeo is a Folk band from the Netherlands.

In the fast growing world of Balfolk music, Orfeo hopes to distinguish itself by creating their own special sound. They like to accomplish this through the composing of new material en by using out of the ordinary intruments. By using specific rhythms and accents, their music is typically suitable for Balfolk dancing, but Orfeo also wants to offer the listener an interesting time, and they are not afraid to experiment with these two different goals at the same time. When they met, the musicians of Orfeo came from totally different backgrounds like medieval music, classical music and metal, and this still can be heard in the music they make today!

Orfeo is Erica (flutes), Lies (harp and hurdy-gurdy), Marco (12-stringed gitar and hurdy-gurdy), Paul (electronic double-bass) and Rutger (drums and cajon). The members of Orfeo are also involved in other musical projects such as Rama, Ball Noir and Kelten zonder Grenzen. Different folkbals and venues throughout the Netherlands have heard Orfeo and also a large number of festivals is on their list, such as the Elf Fantasy Fair, Archeon Midwinterfair and the Midvinterfestival in Denmark. The Orfeoâ€™s themselves are also very fond of dancing and can be found on many a folkbal!

2. Orfeo is also a Dark Electro band from Mexico.

3. Orfeo is also a Hip Hop artist from San Antonio, USA.
