Serpent Venom arose from the grave in 2008. The brainchild of riff machine Pete Fox, of Olde Crone, he found like minded musicians to embrace and help channel the visions and sounds from within. Recruiting Blood Island Raiders' drum battering machine Paul Sutherland, the sorrowful cries were provided by Garry 'Gaz' Ricketts, formerly of Sloth and the bass was taken care of by some hairy bloke called Nick.
 
The band were taken on by Church Within records and have released the album 'Carnal Altar'. Receiving high praise by many, the band has followed a path of live destruction to compliment the record reviews.
