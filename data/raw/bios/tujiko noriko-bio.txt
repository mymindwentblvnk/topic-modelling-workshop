Tujiko Noriko (born Noriko Tsujiko (辻子紀子) on August 28, 1976 in Osaka, Japan) is a Japanese musician, singer-songwriter and filmmaker based in Paris, France.  Because of her experimental style, she is sometimes compared to Múm, or Björk. Much of her music consists of gradually-added layers of electronic beats, melodies, samples, and vocals. The lyrics are primarily in Japanese, with the occasional song in English.

To date she has recorded and released over 15 highly regarded albums for labels including Mego, Tomlab, Fat Cat, Room 40 and Asphodel. In 2003 her album Hard Ni Sasete received an Honorary Mention at the Prix Ars Electronica. 

Tujiko has written music for films, dance, animations and art installations, and has also made several collaborative works with musicians Peter Rehberg, Aoki Takamasa and Lawrence English. She has performed and toured extensively worldwide, including big festivals like Sonar, Benicassim, Mutek and many others.

She has worked for the Austrian label MEGO, and the German Tomlab. In 2004 she teamed up with Peter 'Pita' Rehberg to form DACM making the album Stéréotypie. 

In Spring 2012 she was artist in residence at WORM, a Rotterdam-based institute for avant garde music and art to record new music. 

She is currently living in Paris and is also working on experimental short movies. According to an article in The Japan Times, she has completed two movies: Sand and Mini Hawaii and Sun. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tujiko+Noriko">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
