Nocuous is a one-man metal project hailing from Framingham, Massachusetts. Formed out of frustration, the ever-present and ever-clear goal of the project is to make metal the way it should be, balls out, evil, raw, fast, fun, and made for Metalheads, not music students. In keeping with the true one-man DIY aspect, all music is self produced and recorded in a makeshift bedroom studio on little or no budget.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nocuous">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
