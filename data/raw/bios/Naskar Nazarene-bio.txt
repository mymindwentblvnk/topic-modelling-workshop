A band from the Lehigh Valley region of Pennsylvania. A down right dirty sludge band in the vein of Eyehategod and Kyuss with elements of High on Fire thrown in for good measure. Take this, add a cringe sense of humor, a few criminal charges, and a ton of hick attitude (an exaggerated amount of hick persona) and you get Naskar Nazarene. Oh yeah, and if you didn't figure it out, their last names are all beers... <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Naskar+Nazarene">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
