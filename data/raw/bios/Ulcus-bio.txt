Ulcus (formerly known as Ulcus Molle, 1994-1999) was a Symphonic Black Metal from Sogndal, Norway. From their beginning in 1994 to their split-up in 2000 they released 3 Demos (Yggdrasil, Roles and Malicious Triumph) and only one full-length album called Cherish the Obscure.  Soon after the release of Cherish the Obscure they decided to end Ulcus as the members joined Windir.

Nowadays the members of Ulcus play in the Norwegian Black Metal bands Vreid and Cor Scorpii which were founded after Windir disbanded. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ulcus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
