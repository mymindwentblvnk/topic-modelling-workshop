Ataxia was a short-lived American experimental rock band from Los Angeles, California formed in 2004 by guitarist John Frusciante (Red Hot Chili Peppers), bassist Joe Lally (Fugazi) and drummer Josh Klinghoffer (Red Hot Chili Peppers, Dot Hacker, The Bicycle Thief).

Ataxia wrote and recorded songs for two weeks, and the material was separated into two albums: Automatic Writing (2004) and AW II (2007). The songs all feature a ground-bass line with the guitar overlaying different motifs and long developments.

Ataxia performed two shows, both at the Knitting Factory in Los Angeles, on February 2 and February 3, 2004. Following this, the group disbanded. Josh Klinghoffer continues to work with Frusciante on his solo projects. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ataxia">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
