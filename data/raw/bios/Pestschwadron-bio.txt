Horde Pestschwadron gathered in the early year of 2007 through the endless hatred of sub-human live and christian believes of Sturmherr Leichenadler and GÃ¶tz von Tod. In autumn 2007 Lord S joined the Horde and supports Pestschwadron with his MG42 skills. Pestschwadron plays BM in order to spread hate and to crush cristanity. Lyriks deal with war, pure hatred for foreign religions, history and heritage and our believes in nature and our own forgotten gods. The first demo "Im Auftrag Degen Den Herrn" from Pestschwadron limited to 88 tapes is sold out. The first split with Knochenpanzer "Ein Meer Von Toten" limited to 88 tapes was released by Heathen Blood Records. Pestschwadron contributed the track "Lykanerorden" to the "Winter Moonlight" Sampler of Eradicaton Process Productions.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pestschwadron">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
