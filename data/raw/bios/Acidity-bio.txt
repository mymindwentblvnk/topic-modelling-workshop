1. Acidity is a 4 piece thrash metal band formed in 2010 under the name "Existence". After only 1 year the line up, composed by Andrea "Steeler" (guitars), Mattia Itala (guitars and vocals), Stefano Quaglia (drums) and Alessandro Castagneri (bass), decides to change the monicker in "Parasite", and after the first live appearances, Mattia decides to leave the role of guitarist to dedicate himself exclusively to the vocals.
In the same year the band recorded his first raw material and came out with the demo called "Human Destruction".
Due to a case of homonymy, the band had to change the name another time, and under the new name "Acidity" they start to distribute the second demo "Blinded by Ignorance".
After having the opportunity to play in some important italian stages (like SunValley festival, in Milan supporting Heathen, and more..) Stefano decides to leave the band, and readily Simone Cibrario join the band as new drummer.
In 2014, with this line up, the band signs with the newborn label "Nightbreaker Productions" and enters the studio for the recording of the debut album call "Into the Lies" that has come out in November 2014.
