After having several early releases on labels like Audio Therapy, Fade Records and Mo-Do, Nick started his solo career under the moniker "One Of Them".

After releasing numerous successful EPs on labels like Moodgadget Records, Fade Records and Blau Motif Records to name a few, demand for remixes soon followed from labels like Bedrock Records, Moodmusic and many more.
