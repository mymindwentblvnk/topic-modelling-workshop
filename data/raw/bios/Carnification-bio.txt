The band was initially put together in 1992, by Jo√£o Raposo, Marco Camilo e Rui Frias. Started out playing an Heavy Metal genre, later influenced by bands like Death, Obituary, Morbid Angel, exploring thus a more aggressive style - the Death Metal. In 1995 the band made their debut presentation, but due to constant line-up changes, CARNIFICATION is forced to pause all they work. In 1997 the band returns with a renewed line-up and heading the studio to record the one track "Embracing Solitude" by beginning of 1998. This lyric clearly points out melodic sounds and yet aggressive influences from other bands like At The Gates and Death. Later in 2008, due to numerous personal reasons, CARNIFICATION gradually commences rehearsing, this time with a more mature and well defined line-up, in a mood to recover the northern melodic death metal sound of the band.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Carnification">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
