THRENODIA was formed in autumn 2010 out of the ashes of an inconsiderable Dark Metal band with the intention to channel all the members’ energy, effort and experience they had gained in several bands into one band. Inspiration comes from melodic and also raw Black Metal of the 2nd and 3rd Black Metal wave of the 90s. The first demo entitled "In Trümmern" was released as Web-EP in July 2011. Our upcoming release entitled "Aschewelten" will include this demo. Watch out for this release!
