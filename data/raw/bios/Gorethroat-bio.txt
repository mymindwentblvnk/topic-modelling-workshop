After the band was found in summer 2006 from Marc, Robert, Roman and Hoschie in Germany, it was broke up because of a lack of practicing room. In November 2007 they found a flat which were renovated which became the new practicing room and so the band was revived without Roman.
We are still practicing to complete a number of songs to enter the stage in late january 2008. On February they played their first show on a local gig, it was we'll appreciated and even a photo was in the newspaper.
In Juli 2008 they recorded their first self-recorded debut-album "Flood of Blood", which will be released in early 2009. Tshirts are availible yet. The Album contains 11 tracks and has a playtime of 43 Minutes.
Also they have a new bass player called Fabian or "Grunz", which plays live and will be on the next record. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gorethroat">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
