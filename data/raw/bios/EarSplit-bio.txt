Having formed in 1998 by Yaz and Kenny and being disbanded with Yaz’s departure after a couple of years and some fine gigs and original compositions, the band regrouped in 2005 with Kenny wanting to take the band further to where it belonged. Earsplit regrouped with core members, Ash, Sid and Rj and the band went underway again and auditioned for bass and keyboard players.

 That’s where Jack and Solo came into the picture. Jack and solo contributed largely in the transformation of the earlier versions of the songs. Earsplit, over the years had seen many dropouts but stuck to what they believe in and kept on going till finally they got a lineup that seemed to have clicked with crooner, Ryan (After Sid’s departure). However that too didn’t last long and the band recruited Cleatus as their frontman who has performed a few gigs with the band and indicted a new feel to the chemistry.
