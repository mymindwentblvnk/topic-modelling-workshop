Amor Fou comes to life in Milan, in 2006.

Adele H. and Paolo M. were young regular lovers who used to mix politics and drugs, poetry and sculpture, sex and love in perfect balance. They left each other the day the Piazza Fontana bombing took place.

Fourty years later, 'someone' wrote an album inspired by their hate and love.
A love that destroys anything, without any brakes or rules.
A love that suddenly gains possess of a life, upsets it, and can't be confined. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Amor+Fou">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
