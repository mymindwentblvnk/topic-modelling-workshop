Hailing from Colorado, Ruins of Tomorrow delivers a sound that is as heavy as the infamous mountains that define the band's state. Combining the catchy, driving rhythms of hardcore and the technicality of death metal, ROT has carved out a niche in an otherwise overcrowded genre. Seldom used to any band's advantage, Ruins of Tomorrow is a dual vocal wielding band that truly uses the power and range that a two-vocalist band should. ROT capitalizes on this with Trax Henderson's brutal commanding lows and mid-range screams, while Kyle Kelley's terrifying shrieks and crushing growls will leave you battered and broken. All six members blend their talents to form tightly knit melodies and a live experience that is hard to rival. Ruins of Tomorrow never ceases to provide crowds with an in-your-face energy that reverberates throughout the entire venue.

With a number of self-booked tours under their belts, and the recent release of their debut EP "In This Horror," Ruins of Tomorrow shows a dedication and work ethic of a band determined for success. A solid supporting fan base, not only in their home state, but the surrounding mid-west shows a love of the band's authenticity and heavy music. Taking tremendous pride in their aggressive, energetic, and crowd involving live shows, Ruins of Tomorrow always leaves a show with new friends and fans. Always sharing their experiences and love for what they do, ROT maintains a strong web presence in order to stay connected with fans anywhere from Iowa to Indonesia.

Ruins of Tomorrow is looking up with determination in their eyes and a monumental sound and attitude to propel them forward. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ruins+of+Tomorrow">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
