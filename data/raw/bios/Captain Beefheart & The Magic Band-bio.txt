Don Van Vliet (Don Glen Vliet on January 15, 1941-December 17, 2010) is an American musician and visual artist, best known by the pseudonym Captain Beefheart. His musical work was mainly conducted with a rotating assembly of musicians usually called The Magic Band (but credited as His  Magic Band on pre 1970 album releases), which was active from the mid-1960s to the early 1980s. Van Vliet was chiefly a singer and harmonica player, occasionally playing noisy, untrained free jazz-influenced saxophone and keyboards. His compositions are characterized by their odd mixtures of shifting time signatures and by their surreal lyrics, while Van Vliet himself is noted for his dictatorial approach to his musicians and for his enigmatic relationship with the public. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Captain+Beefheart+&+The+Magic+Band">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
