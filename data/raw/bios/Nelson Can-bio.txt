Nelson Can is a Scandinavian all female-band, based in Copenhagen. The band operates with several dogmas and a very noticeable one is that the band use no guitars. The sound is original and "to-the-bone" simple, inspired by acts like the White Stripes, PJ Harvey, Gossip, the Black Keys and Dead Weather. The set-up with only drums and bass creates the perfect framework for the simple, yet very powerful minimalistic dogma rock sound.

Members:
Selina Gin - lead vocals
Maria Juntunen - drums
Signe SigneSigne - bass
