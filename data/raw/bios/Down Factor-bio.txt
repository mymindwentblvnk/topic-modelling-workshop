From Down Factor`s MySpace:

From the hell bound heart of the East Bay Metal Scene comes Down Factor, the heaviest band in the Bay Area. Based in Oakland, California, Down Factor is a metal band that has evolved to a new culture of music full of aggression and intensity. Down Factor has created a style of music that is inspired by the goals that cannot be reached the bell that never rings and the damned. As physically demanding as it is intense. Down Factor sounds like a cross breed of Sepultura, Slayer, and Fear Factory, using elements of tribal like bark vocals along side with technical speed and grooves. 
Down Factor is currently writing songs for a new CD to come out in 2009. Please visit the band's myspace page to listen to songs from the band's last CD Murder the World.
