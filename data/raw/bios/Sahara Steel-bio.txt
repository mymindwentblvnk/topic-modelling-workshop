Sahara Steel was an early 90's Heavy Metal band similar to Steelheart and Babylon AD. They released one album in 1990, that made little impact on the heavy metal scene, and were soon wiped away and forgotten by the Grunge movement in 1991. In 2005 Perris Records released a remastered cd of Sahara Steel's debut album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sahara+Steel">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
