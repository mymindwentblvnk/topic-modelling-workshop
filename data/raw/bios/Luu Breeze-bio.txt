Luu is a young up and coming rapper straight out of Toronta As he likes to call it.Who is looking to make a huge impact in the rap game and finally put Toronto and Canada as a whole on the map and give us the respect that we damn well deserve. Luu was born and raised for 10 years in a metro housing apartment complex in Scarboroughs own Orton Park, where his older brother then discovered that he had a gift.It all started as just meaningless mumbels but styll at a young age he had a flow that was on beat and on point and could rhyme some words.Then moving out of Orton Park to different locations by the years Luu then left the rap thing alone for awhile.Only to come back in high school freestyling and gettin into battles with everybody he then knew his gift had never left him.He Started taking it serious from that point on in high school and when finished now looks to make it his life.With that being said Luu is determined to do whatever it takes to put his name, his peoples,his city and his team(ChamPaigne GanG) on the worlwide map.ChamPaigne Gang was a name that his older cousin(Free H) got from being in the streets when the cops labeled his street movement as the ChamPainge Gang.When Luu looked at his movement in the rap game as a music and street movement he then knew it was only right that when his cousin got locked(Free H)It was only right that the named lived on.Then It began with just family and cousins but has evolved into friends and family and now is looked at as one of the biggest movements moving right now.The Main group of 6 artist and 1 man(Illinoy)who makes sure business gets taken care of consist of Luu Breeze,BlueFlame(Pumpie & Baretta)Juss Nice,Cap D,Joel & Illinoy.With Luu leading the way working on his second mixtape(Prince Of The Dot Vol.2-The Crowning)Be sure that the rest of the camp ain't waiting around and will be out with mixtapes in the works from BlueFlame and Juss Nice.C.P.G Is the movement and will be taking these streets by storm.(Luu can also be seen on the rapsheets vol.3 dvd and also on the up and coming rapsheets dvd coming in march/april 2006.)Nothing will stop Breezy as he looks to make history and is already being looked at as one of the best and hottest to do it out of this city with his versitallity flow and his smooth swagger be on the look for Breezy.Matter of fact.....He is the hottest out DON'T SLEEP ON BREEZY!Cause you will see him at the top with Toronto and Nova Scotia on his shoulders and Canada on his back.Move Bitcch Get Out My Way...................................
