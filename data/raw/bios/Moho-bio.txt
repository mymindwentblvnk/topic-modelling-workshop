After Like Peter at Home career came to an end in may 2003, Raúl (guitar), Iñaki (bass & vocals) and Eduardo (drums), from Madrid, get into a new odyssey called MOHO. MOHO is the product of spending several hours in the rehearsal room and the influence of cult bands like Electric Wizard, Bongzilla, Black Sabbath, High on Fire, etc… The band starts playing live in summer 2003 receiving good critics. These first shows are but the beginning of a series of gigs happening almost each weekend throughout the whole country. In October 2003 the band goes on a mini European tour through France, Germany and Denmark. The response in these shows was really good so the band begins to make a name itself into the underground European scene. Everybody talks about their powerful live shows and musicianship. During a break in that tour, the band records their first album “20 uñas” in Paris in only session, which is going to be released in June 2004 through Throne Records in Europe and Shifty Records in the States. They play in more and more shows after that tour until March 2004 when they go on tour again supporting BRAINOIL during 22 concerts in 22 days in countries like France, Spain, Germany or Belgium. The public response is superb again and everybody that has seen the band speaks about the powerful live shows of MOHO. Their first album is released in June 2004, receiving some excelent criticism from the underground press and followers. The band now is still writing new songs, and playing gigs throughout Spain, when not on European tour. In their last tour they played in places such as Belgium, France, Holland, Denmark, Hungary, Sweden, Austria or Germany. Besides, they are working on new songs for their second LP. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Moho">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
