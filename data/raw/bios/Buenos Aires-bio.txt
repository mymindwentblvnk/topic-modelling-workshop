Buenos Aires are a four piece post-hardcore/alternative band from Leicester, UK. They are known to blend soft, melodic interludes with brash, manic breakdowns and raw but catchy choruses. Their debut EP, ‘A Landscape To A Blind Man’s Eye’ was released in September of 2008, and has since sold out. In 2009 came four more new songs in the form of the ‘Demos’ release. This was given away for free and made available for free download along with the debut EP.

Buenos Aires are proud of working with a strong DIY ethic; recording and producing all their own material, and working closely with local grass-roots record label, Robot Needs Home.

As well as working towards their releases, Buenos pride themselves on live performance. So far they have played across the country, bagging some enviable support slots along the way with the likes of Maybeshewill, Johnny Foreigner, And So I Watch You From Afar, Adebisi Shank, Sucioperro, Dananananaykroyd, Tubelord, Blakfish, Post War Years, Brontide, Cats & Cats & Cats, ox.eagle.lion.man, Mutiny on the Bounty and The James Cleaver Quintet. 
In 2011 they released their new EP "Fair Winds".
