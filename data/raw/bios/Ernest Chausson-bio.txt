Ernest Chausson (January 20, 1855 – June 10, 1899) was a French composer.

 
His work is commonly divided into three periods, the first of which is dominated by Massenet and exhibits fluid and elegant melodies. The second period dating from 1886 is marked by a more dramatic character, benefitting by his contacts with the artistic milieux in which he moved. The third period dates from his father's death in 1894 and was influenced by his reading of the symbolist poets and Russian literature, particularly Turgenev, Dostoyevsky, and Tolstoy.


His work shows the influence of Massenet, Franck, Richard Wagner, and Johannes Brahms. His compositional style bridges the gap between Massenet and Franck and the later generation of French composers such as Claude Debussy.

He is primarily noted for his many songs; his orchestral output was comparatively small. Surviving works include a Symphony in B flat major, Poème for violin and orchestra (an important piece in the violin repertoire) and Poème de l'amour et de la mer for voice and orchestra.
