Forever Untouched was born in late 2000 from a group of musicians looking to stand out amongst the thriving nu-metal scene in Cleveland. The band featured Doug French on vocals, Cole Martinez and Cliff Edwards on guitar, Tony Howard on bass and Jon Vinson on drums. Playing only a handful of shows, they released a critically acclaimed EP "Decay of Those Divine" in 2002. Acheiving mild success, the band continued writing new material towards a future release. The plans were scrapped in 2003 when Jon Vinson left the band to attend music school. Upon his return in 2005, the band breifly reunited to play one show, but were unable to continue together because of conflicting schedules and other musical projects.
