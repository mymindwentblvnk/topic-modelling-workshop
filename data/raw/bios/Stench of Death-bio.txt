Proudly Presents


Retrospect 




The Album
 We present to you our first (demo) full-length album “Retrospect”. Musically a brutal combination of various metal influences we have experienced throughout years of listening metal. Mainly it consists of death and (some) black metal riffs with pounding hammer works. Synthesizers are (of course) used to create the appropriate mood whenever needed. A fierce throat finishes off the work. On two songs the former lead singer of the legendary eighties band “Speedica” even kicks in a good old-school fashion vocal style. 
 The lyrics on “Retrospect” have evolved from our interest in the founding process of the Third Reich. Please realize that we absolutely do not sympathize with neo-Nazis, or their ideologies in any way. Comments and a more in depth concept of the lyrics are available at our website.
During the recording of ‘Retrospect’, we were helped out by Maurice Brouwers from Engine of Pain. At this moment he also just finished doing studio work for Callenish Circle.


History
Stench of death originated from Mergelgraaf, a Dutch band which was formed in 1998 by, amongst others, Ron and Tim. After two years, Mergelgraaf got into a musical deadlock and was laid to rest. Ron than started a new band with a new drummer and vocalist. They called themselves  'Stench of Death'. After two years of making (hardcore) death metal, they decided to bring a twist into this form of metal. They asked the former keyboard player to rejoin the club again.  This did not work to well either, because the vocalist had a lack of dedication. So, after a long search, Niels came to the rescue, and it turned out that he was a very welcome addition to Stench of Death.
