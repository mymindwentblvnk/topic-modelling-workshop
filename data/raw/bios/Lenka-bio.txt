Her song "Everything at Once" was also used in the official Windows 8 TV Ad. As a teenager, Lenka studied acting at the Australian Theatre For Young People, where she trained with actress Cate Blanchett. Lenka starred in the Australian ABC-TV drama series GP as Vesna Kapek in the 1990s. She also hosted Channel Ten children's program Cheez TV, and guest starred in other Australian TV series including Home and Away, Wild Side, Head Start and Spellbinder. She appeared in Australian feature films The Dish and Lost Things, as well as in theatre productions.

Kripac was a member of the Australian electronic-rock crossover band Decoder Ring for two of their albums. She then moved to California in 2007. After adopting her first name as her sole artistic name, Lenka released her eponymous debut album on 24 September 2008. She has since released two more studio albums - 2011's Two and 2013's Shadows.
