Arakiel was founded in early 2009, by Nicholas Ahonen (Guitars), Gustav Harnesk (Bass) and Max Nordin (Guitars). Robin Möllnitz (Vocals) and Christoffer Holm (Drums) joined later the same year. 

 After some turbulence within the band during the recording of the EP/demo "Världen Står I Brand" in 2011, Robin Möllnitz decided to quit the band. Nicholas Ahonen then overtook the role as lead singer permanently after doing the vocals on the demo. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/ARAKIEL">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
