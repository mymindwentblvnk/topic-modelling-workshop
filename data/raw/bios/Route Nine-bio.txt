Route Nine is an obscure Dan Swanö sideproject, consisting of the man himself, and drummer Anders Jacobsson. Musically, it is a rather unique mix of progressive metal, death metal, jazz and gothic rock, though styles vary from song to song greatly. Unfortunately, as interesting as the band's sound is, they were rather shortlived, and only have three recording sessions worth of material, each of which are found on the 'Works' EP. Highly experimental and unique, one of Swanö's most interesting projects. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Route+Nine">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
