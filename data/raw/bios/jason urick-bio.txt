Husbands comes out in late October and will probably appeal to fans of WZT Hearts (obviously) and to those who enjoy some of our more recent avant-releases like Mountains, Lithops, David Daniell and Douglas McCombs and Lokai.

Husbands is Jason Urick’s solo debut. Those well-versed in the Baltimore or experimental electronic music scenes might be familiar with his band WZT Hearts or his solo works as themoonstealingproject. Husbands finds Urick at a crossroads where his ideas are becoming more fully realized, and while still experimental in nature, the songs are envisioned as an honest attempt at "pop“.

There are similarities to his previous projects of course. Those familiar with WZT Hearts will feel that the tracks on Husbands are in-line with the more ambient pieces that the band produced. Ghosted, fragmented melodies, distorted tones and so forth. Compared to themoonstealingproject, Husband“ has more depth sound-wise and the songs tend to take the longer route with tracks averaging around the 10 minute mark each. After spending four years in WZT Hearts where all the music was improvised, it was a relaxing and refreshing change of pace to take an idea, let it unfurl, and watch it burn slowly into extended soundscapes. The result is an album that is a complex study in subtlety and one that rewards patience.

Sounds and ideas for Husbands were recorded as early as 2005 but the majority of the song creation and mixing was done in mid-to-late 2008. The album was recorded entirely at Floristree in Baltimore by Urick. Emma Walters contributes harmonica and voice to Strides and The Eternal Return but the remainder is solely the work of Urick.
