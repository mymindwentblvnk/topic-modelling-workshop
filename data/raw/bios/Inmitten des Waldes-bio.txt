Melancholic and chaotic black metal influenced by the German school of Nargaroth and Flammentod. Formed in '03 by N. and J. under the name of "Between the Forests", the band has later changed its name and released an instrumental promo tape back in '04. The late works, "Traumgarten" from '05 and "Alte Zeiten, lindern Trauer" from '06, are lyrically influenced by German poetry (W. Goethe and E. Geibel) and contain some piano pieces composed and executed by N., who is also responsible for Lebensessenz, a neo-romantic piano music project. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Inmitten+des+Waldes">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
