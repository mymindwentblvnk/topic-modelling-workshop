Every member in Character is a songwriter. Dave (guitar), Eric (bass) and William (guitar) were all fronting bands in Nashville handling the writing and vocals. Scott (drums) was recording entire records in his bedroom with himself on every instrument. Ryan (keyboards) and Luke (theremin) had been in countless bands around the same time. One spring day in 2001, the group of young musicians met at Eric's house to try something new: instrumentals. What came out were songs that manage to hook you with dynamic melodies and raw energy without relying on vocals to carry it.

The first thing they did was record A Flashing of Knives and Green Water their debut on Set International Records. When released locally Febuary 2001 it was greeted with favorable reviews and managed to sell over three hundred copies in Nashville alone. Now with the release of their second record, We Also Create False Promises on October 29th, the band is ready for the rest of the country. The disc was recorded by Roger Moutenot (of Yo La Tengo fame) and Nashville engineer Loney Hutchins.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Character">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
