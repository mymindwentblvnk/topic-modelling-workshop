No Souls Lost, hailing from Dallas, Texas formed in 2005 and quickly became a force to be reckoned with. The band, made up of ex-members of Prophecy, Vitality and Aversion to Life have released an EP titled, "These Dead Years" for Moshpit Tragedy Records, as well as having self released their debut album, "Eulogy of Genecide" all in 2006.

In the months to follow No Souls Lost have ripped it up on stage with such influential acts as Decapitated, Six Feet Under, Necrophagist, All That Remains, Deicide and many others. A rugged schedule of show in the South West and Mid-West, as well as festival appearances helped catapult them to the attention of Open Grave Records.

August of 2007, Open Grave Records signed No Souls Lost with a new album expected for release in early 2008.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/No+Souls+Lost">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
