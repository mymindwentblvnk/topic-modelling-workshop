Malpas is the indie music project of songwriter Ali M Forbes and producer Andy Savours. Their trademark sound juxtaposes traditional instruments with analogue synths, processed beats and low-key vocal melodies, resulting in a mixture of intimate folk songs and ambient electronica that is hard to categorize but emotionally specific.
 
They released their debut EP ‘Promise’ in November 2013 which won them fans across several key blogs such as The 405, The Line of Best Fit, Music Ninja and Indie Shuffle.
'Promise’ quickly received over 50,000 listens on Soundcloud and lead track 'Charlemagne' was spun multiple times on BBC 6music, andAmazing Radio.
 
2015 sees the partnership preparing to release their debut album ‘Rain River Sea’ on the 31st July on Killing Moon Records in the UK and Europe and Yebo Music in North America. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Malpas">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
