Tony MacAlpine (born August 29, 1960 in Springfield, Massachusetts) is a guitar and keyboard virtuoso who came on to the neo classical/shred scene in the mid 80s. He later experimented with jazz rock fusion and combined it with his classical training, as can be heard on Chromaticity (2001). He has released many solo albums in his career. Some of his other projects include CAB, Planet X, Steve Vai and Ring of Fire. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tony+MacAlpine">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
