InDenial came into being in 2007…the actual date is unknown. We had our first gig at Club Geneve, located in Chaguanas, Central Trinidad, in January 2008…yes, yes it took a whole year. The band line-up was the same as below except for the presence of Andre Esdelle-Thomas who was replaced by Woody (Ronald Hosein) in December 2008. Our first performance with him came in December ‘08 at Corner Bar, Port-of-Spain (kinda like a second debut…forgive the oxymoron).The band has been a dream that existed in my mind since I fell in love with Rock ‘n Roll…during my high-school years. All of us share a passion for rock music that cannot be measured – we simply love this music and just want to create and play it. Rock ‘n Roll will never die and we’re just glad to be part of it…


Band Members:

    * Javid “Mustad” Sarafat (lead vocals, guitar)
    * Ronald “Woody”  Hosein (guitar, backup vocals)
    * Nicholas “Moe” Sonnylal (bass)
    * Shay “Sanchez II” Seecharan (drums, backup vocals)

Music Style:

Progressive Hard Rock. (It’s really hard to describe our playing style with just a few words but I guess the three words given are the best we can use.)
