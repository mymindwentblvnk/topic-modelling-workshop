There are 2 bands with this name:
1)
BEFORE: the band Ubiquitous 
The band formed in May 1997, with their debut performance at Blaxalnd Church of Christ receiving a truly 'rock' response, that saw grey haired elders moshing and stage diving from the pulpit. The recording of a three track unreleased demo gave the band a spot on the bill for Blackstump '97. Since then the band has gone on to play various gigs around Sydney which have included gigs in Merrylands, Toongabbie, Thornleigh, Stanwell Tops, Penrith, Kelts Bar, and the Forest Inn Bexley. In 1998 a second CD was recorded at Graylabel and was released as an EP. (now sold out) 

In 2000 the band changed names to something a bit more pronounceable, PSYCOMA. Under this new name the band hooked up with Steve Rowe to record their debut full length album which has just been released. The band will be looking to play a few shows to promote the disc, and Steve is taking some on tour with Mortification to promote it.

AFTER: the band Psycoma
