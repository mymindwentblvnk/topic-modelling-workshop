Jackie-O Motherfucker is an American experimental rock group founded in Portland, Oregon, United States in 1994.

Jackie-O Motherfucker began as a duo consisting of multi-instrumentalist Tom Greenwood and saxophonist Nester Bucket. The group now has more than twenty rotating members drawn from the U.S. experimental scene, including members of Evolutionary Jass Band,Gang Gang Dance, Set Fire to Flames, Heavy Winged, and Portland artists Nudge, Eternal Tapestry, Inca Ore, Dragging an Ox through Water, Valet, and White Rainbow As of 2006, the core of the group is founding member Greenwood.

JOMF's music draws from a variety of subgenres including drone, free jazz, space-rock and is heavily improvisational in its nature. Because they are a collective, rather than a consistent band or group, the sound of their music can change from performance to performance. The group operates its own label of CD-R live recordings, the U-Sound Archive, which features concert recordings from JOMF as well as like-minded subterranean artists such as Double Leopards, Sunroof!, Decaer Pinga and Vibracathedral Orchestra.

The group's first three albums were limited-run vinyl-only releases on now-defunct Portland label Imp Records. Since then, the group has had recordings released by many different labels from around the world. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jackie-O+Motherfucker">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
