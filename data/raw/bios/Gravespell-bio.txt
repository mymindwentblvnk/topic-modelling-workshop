Gravespell started out as a black metal studio project called Gannondorf. Heavily influenced by themes from the popular Legend of Zelda video game series, they labeled themselves as "True Hyrulian Black Metal". The first demo was released in 2008 with Dan Morris on vocals, Alonzo Larios on Guitar, and Ryan Bruno on bass. Two years later the Band released their second demo "Throne Through Time" which featured more experimental and psychedelic elements in their music.

Eventually, the band grew out of the studio and became a live act with Molly Smith on bass and Ethan Stouder on drums. With a full lineup, they started opening for bands such as Pathology, Revocation, and Abigail Williams. Plans for a full length album were implemented but stalled due to production and time restraints.

With the departure of their bassist, Gannondorf soon recruited Garrett Davis on guitar and Nick Lepisto on bass from the death metal band Blood Geyser, the name was changed to Gravespell. Their sound grew into a mixture of black and death metal experimenting with progressive and psychedelic styles. Production continued on the album which features new renditions of older songs such as "Din", "Arrogant Bastard" and "Gaia terminus". The album is planned to be released in 2012 independently; a title for the album has not been given as of yet.   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gravespell">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
