Freek Coppens (aka Ferreck Dawn) has been active as a DJ and producer for over 13 years now. His productions -- released on well-known labels like Spinnin’ Records, Toolroom, Material, Nervous, and Hey records -- have been supported by DJs like Luciano, Carl Cox, Dubfire, Mark Knight, Davide Squillace, Matthias Tanzmann, Nic Fanciulli, Paco Osuna, Maceo Plex, Laurent Garnier, The Magician and even big guns like Steve Angello, Chuckie, Pete Tong and Tiësto.
 
Last year Ferreck teamed up with Redondo, and together they released ‘Tattoo Girl’ on Material records. This tune became the best-selling track of the label in 2013 and made it into the Beatport Tech House Top 10 for several weeks in a row. Recently they released the official follow up to ‘Tattoo Girl’ -- ‘Love Too Deep’. The melodic hit has resided in the Beatport Deep House Top 10 for an impressive 3 months in a row and is taking over the airwaves with radio stations like BBC Radio 1, Tiesto supporting and Slam FM declaring the track a Grandslam.

As a solo artist, Ferreck Dawn has had charting releases on Spinnin’ Records, Toolroom, and Nervous Records; features on multiple Sensation Compilations; and remixes for Martin Garrix, Sander van Doorn, DVBBS, Sander Kleinenberg, Funkerman, and René Amesz.

The success hasn’t gone unnoticed. Spinnin’ Records, one of the biggest dance labels and home to Martin Garrix, Sander van Doorn and Oliver Heldens amongst others, recently signed Ferreck exclusively.

With a lot of new tracks and remixes in the pipeline, and upcoming performances in countries like Romania, Sweden, United Kingdom, Spain and Greece, 2014 is going to be the year that Ferreck Dawn takes it to the next level.
