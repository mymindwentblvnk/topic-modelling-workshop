Since its inception in 2011, Clu has married audio and visual in the most visceral of ways. Once a duo, it’s now spearheaded by Dublin-born, London-based producer and vocalist Sean Cooley, who has once again reinvented the project, figuratively and literally adding a unique accent to the work.

Subject of a mini-doc on Boiler Room, releases on international labels like Mr. Mitch’s Gobstobber, premieres on Vice, and sold out venues in the UK and Ireland, the dark, moody and ever-evolving sound of Clu has brought Cooley to the peaks of the underground.

The unpredictability of what’s to come next is why Clu has gathered such a dedicated audience, and once again Cooley has defied all expectations with his forthcoming project 'Going Kayfabe'. A more aggressive new musical direction, there’s a tangible sense of passion and frustration in the record. Arriving on Beijing label 'S!LK', ‘Going Kayfabe’ is a track for everyone dead broke and dead busy.

Growing up in Dublin, but having to leave after being choked out by the country's unsupportive arts council, the track echoes with disdain for apathetic governmental departments. Artists in his hometown of Ireland often find themselves stuck in “emotional prisons”, while arts bodies try to appease tourists with what they consider 'art'. In that process they end up forcing talented artists to emigrate to cities like London or Berlin, where they're ultimately embraced. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Clu">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
