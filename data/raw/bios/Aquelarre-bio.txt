After the dissolution of Almendra in 1970, Emilio del Güercio (bass) and Rodolfo García (drums) joined with Héctor Starc (guitar) and Hugo González Neira (keyboard) to form Aquelarre. The official debut of the band was in 1972 (even though they had performed previously in B.A.Rock II festival, 1971), and they recorded their first album (Aquelarre) later that year. It followed Candiles (1973), Brumas (1974) and Siesta (1975). In 1975 they started a tour in Spain. They returned to Argentina (without González Neira) in 1977 for their goodbye concert.

Their music was more sophisticated than the standard Argentine rock-and-roll from the early 70s, with constant rhythmic and melodic changes, surrealistic lyrics, and even free jazz passages. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Aquelarre">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
