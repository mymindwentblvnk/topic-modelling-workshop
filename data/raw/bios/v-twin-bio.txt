V Twin are children of screamadelica and have taken the challenge on as few other bands have in the intervening years. V Twin create visionary music that melds electronic and organic sounds seamlessly to create a soundscape that is both ancient and modern. 

The timeline has broken…the band drift in and out of focus on disparate moments past, present and future... The surface of the sound is scraped bare of the artifice of contemporary recording leaving it fizzing and smarting-needle in the red. 

V Twin have an obvious love for the music of the past but their aesthetic is rigorously forward thinking. Dark, funny, violent, playful, euphoric and adventurous, this is rock n’ roll in its purest form…what may come now…may come. 

V Twin are Jason Macphail, Michael McGaughrin, Bobby Kildea & Dino Bardot. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/V-Twin">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
