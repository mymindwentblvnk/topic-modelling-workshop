Smrt is a demoband founded in 2004 by Marko "Sipowicz" Vojvodić (acoustic guitar), Denis "Buletov" Bukvić (vocals), Branimir "Čarolija" Čorlija and Marin Tomičić.

Denis describes their sound as "extreme dissonance in an unreal reality".

Besides acoustic guitar and vocal interpretations, the band often includes instruments such as flute, melodica, harmonica and occasionaly a synthesizer of disputable quality. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/SMRT">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
