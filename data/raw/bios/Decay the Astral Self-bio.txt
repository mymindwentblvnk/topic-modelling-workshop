Decay the Astral Self (formerly Sanguine Overdose) was a death / sludge metal project formed in Easley, South Carolina during 2004. After releasing several rough productions, including two demos and many bonus tracks, the band suffered from internal conflicts leading to line-up shuffles and eventually the end of the group. During their run, they did play several venues in Upstate South Carolina.
