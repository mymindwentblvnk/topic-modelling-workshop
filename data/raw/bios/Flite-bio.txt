Flite (now known as Justin Hawkes) is a US based Drum & Bass producer from Virginia. With a long background in music, Flite tries to capture a listener's imagination through his chord progressions and mellow pads. With support from big names such as Nu:Tone, SPY, The Prototypes, London Elektricity, Liquicity, UKF Drum & Bass, as well as multiple Airplays on BBC Radio1 and XFM, Flite is quickly  moving forward in the international Drum & Bass.

Starting in 2011, Flite has steadily gained international momentum. With releases on Hospital Records, Liquicity Records, Monstercat, and releases promoted by some of the biggest DNB promoters such as UKF Drum & Bass, Liquicity, Suicidesheep and more, Flite's music has spanned the internet with his diverse drum & bass compositions. Flite originally burst onto the liquid scene with his track Blue Spark, which received lots of attention from the youtube channel Liquicity. Since 2013, he has received support from some of Drum & Bass's top DJs and producers, played shows on both sides of the Atlantic, and is set to expand his sound across the world. On the decks, he continually explores with his music styles, delivering a diverse selection of soulful liquid, powerful dnb anthems, and a unique journey of music for every set.

In the summer of 2020 DJ Mantra (co-founder of Rupture and EQ50) made a tweet calling out Flite, claiming that he ripped the name of another UK dnb DJ, DJ Flight. Because of this, Flite changed his name to Justin Hawkes. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Flite">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
