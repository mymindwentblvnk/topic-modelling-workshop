3LW (short for "3 Little Women") was an American pop/R&B singing girl group that enjoyed a number of hits during the early 2000s. Its founding members, Naturi Naughton, Adrienne Bailon (born October 24, 1983 in Manhattan, New York), and Kiely Williams (born July 9, 1986 in Alexandria, Virginia), signed with SoSo Def/Jive/Zomba Records, with Kiely's mother Michele Williams serving as manager. Jessica Benson joined later on when Naturi left mid-2002 due to personal differences with the other members.

Adrienne and Kiely were 2/3 of the Disney movie group turned recording artists The Cheetah Girls (with Sabrina Bryan), while Jessica has moved on to a new girl group called Chocolate and then later on NLA. Naturi Naughton went on to persue a college education, worked on a solo record, and preformed regularly on Broadway's "Hairspray".
