On May 31st, the Montreal based band Mythosis, formed in 2003 by Cryptopsy’s guitarist Chris Donaldson released their latest EP titled "Mind Built Prison". My Own Savior is the first single of Mind Built Prison, whose music video can be seen on youtube.

Mythosis made their first impact with the release of their first EP "Three Prayers for the UnKnown" in 2004, and has since released independently the full length "Counter Fate Illusions" in 2007, followed in 2009 by a USB bracelet, which included a full discography, lyrics, pictures, music video and 4 “unreleased tracks”. In 2011 with the release of Mind Built Prison the band gives a taste of what is to be expected in the near future.
 
Mind Built Prison is available on iTunes and at CdBaby.com
