Salvia Plath used to be Run DMT. Same guy (Michael Collins) running the show, but with a different sound. Where Run DMT was lo-fi and took weird chances that sometimes obscured the inherent melodic quality in the songs, Salvia Plath is more considered and hazily psychedelic in a way that helps the songs sink deeply into the listenerâ€™s consciousness. On their debut LP, The Bardo Story, Collins and a handful of musicians craft folky, freaky sounds that blend acoustic guitars, wobbly drum kits, various keyboards, flutes, and some jangly electric guitars into a mix that makes up in suitably trippy and interesting sounds what it might lack in fidelity.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Salvia+Plath">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
