There are two artists with the name Zero Down:

1. A punk rock trio that existed from 2000-2002. Zero Down disbanded when frontman, bassist, and songwriter Jim Cherry died on July 7, 2002, due to a heart complication. Cherry also played in Pulley and in Strung Out. Their one full-length release, With a Lifetime to Pay, was released on Fat Wreck Chords in 2001. The music was a throwback to mid-90s melodic skate punk.

2. A Seattle-based hard rock band. Their influences include Judas Priest, 70's and 80's Metal, Accept and Thin Lizzy. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Zero+Down">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
