Year 2000, the signs are written everywhere. Very worried about having not enough fun, the real goodass Ker√§nen started beating his old guitar again. Soon Tony joined the jamming with his bass. The band dieselbunny started rolling, when old friends Arttu (v) and Anssi (d) stuck to the bunch. With the first line-up, we made some dozen songs but kept up jamming in the dark cellars. Late 2001 Anssi decided to concentrate on his still steaming Amplifire. Soon, Teemu was found behind the cans.

Early 2003, we finally hit the studio, and recorded the first promo, smoky M.A.N, and started doing some ever succesful shows. Fall 2003 Antti moved to Italy for a while. During his couple of months stay back in Finland summer 2004, we recorded our second effort, more doomy S/T/N. It was only after Antti coming back from Italy at the beginning of 2005 that we hooked Prettyboy Kolivuori to handle an other guitar. After rehearsing a bit and doing a couple of yet greater shows, we hit the studio again.

The result of those few crazy days and nights of may 2006 in Aki Karppinen's studio is "All the Saints", by far our best effort so far. Go ahead, listen to it and get the CD in your hands, you will not regret. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Diesel+Bunny">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
