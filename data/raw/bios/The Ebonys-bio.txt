Formed in Camden, New Jersey, USA, and comprising Jenny Holmes, David Beasley, James Tuten and Clarence Vaughan, the Ebonys had minor success in the early 70s with a Dells -styled approach of baritone lead with answering falsetto second lead. The group was discovered by Gamble And Huff and recorded consistently for their Philadelphia International Records label in the early 70s, but achieved only two sizeable hits on the R&B charts, ‘You’re The Reason Why’ (number 10 R&B, number 51 pop) from 1971, and ‘It’s Forever’ (number 14 R&B, number 68 pop) from 1973. The group recorded for Buddah in 1976 with little success, with only a minor single, ‘Making Love Ain’t No Fun (Without The One You Love)’ (number 83 R&B), making the charts. It was their last chart record.
