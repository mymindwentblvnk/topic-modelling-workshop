Orlando, FL-based 408 was born to accomplish one mission: create. In 2017, the band set out to bring the pop-punk sound reminiscent of the early 2000's back with their first EP, "Mrs. Lemon Squeezer." Taking no time off, the band was back in the studio in the summer and created their second offering, "Oops," this time blending the familiar pop punk sound, alternative, and hip hop to truly kick off listeners' sonic journey with the band. Their 3rd EP "What are you Chewing" released in late 2018. The band's fourth EP "Keri" was recorded by Andrew Wade, He has worked with some of the biggest names in pop punk such as A Day to Remember and Neck Deep. "Keri" was released on Nov. 15th 2019. Silent nights and Drop Out dropped in 2020 with both songs curated to Spotify Playlists and reaching 40k and 100k streams respectively within 2-3 months of release. 408 has completed its latest collection of songs with Andrew Wade in October of 2020. The band will be dropping singles in the fall and winter of 2020. Keep an eye out for new material coming in November!
