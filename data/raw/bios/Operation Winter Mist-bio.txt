Formed as "Kunsten Av Krig", then renamed to Operation Winter Mist in 2001.

The band has also stressed that they are not an NS band:
"Operation Winter Mist is not an NS band and has NO political agenda.
OWM is a band that's subject matter is focused primarily on real war history and the brave men and women that sacrificed themselves to provide us with our freedoms."

OWM's various releases have garnered very favourable reviews and earned it a position on Brave Word's and Bloody Knuckles (CAN) magazine's "100 Most Important Canadian Metal Bands" list in 2006. Beginning with 2002's first official demo release, the Winter Warfare ep (Iron Coffin Productions, CAN) was given the "Demo of the Month" honour by Britain's foremost metal magazine, Terrorizer. This was followed up in 2004 with Winter Warfare II (Regimental Records, USA), a collection of the first remastered ep, new songs and live tracks that sold out it's run within seven months. This release also garnered exceptional reviews and moved the band into a cult status with a feature in the largest selling international metal magazine, Metal Maniacs (USA), the only Calgary band to have done so. 2005's Release, Imperial Grand Strategy (Die Todesrune Records, SPAIN), blasted through it's initial release, on both cd and vinyl formats, in six months and has seen a second fast selling run on cd by the label. The band was once again in Terrorizer (UK) magazine after this release, in which the feature article stated "...you can't do any better than Operation Winter Mist's debut album, Imperial Grand Strategy".
