The Angle Obscure gives the Twin Cities music scene a fusion of contemporary blues, hard rock, and aggressive metal. Providing enough versatility to perform with a wide variety of groups ranging from hip hop, jazz, to death metal. If you dig Between the Buried and Me, Protest the Hero, and/or Pink Floyd then The Angle Obscure is a band you definitely need to experience. The debut effort titled "Silence Is Our Canvas" conceptually revolves around the progression of The Angle Obscure's lineup throughout the addition of each member and the culmination of their added talents. Eric and Mike started building the foundation 4 years ago and was later complimented by Mick and Pat's distinctive sounds and compositional talents. The concept was finalized by the joining of Chester, bringing brutal vocals and an electronic edge (as featured in (he)ARTWORK). The group then created their masterpiece Contra, which birthed a plethora of new ideas and became the sound of The Angle Obscure. The future for this group holds more dynamic time and key changes, a heavier feel, and a more melodic presence.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Angle+Obscure">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
