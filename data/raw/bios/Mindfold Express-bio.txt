A few months later the band set out to record an EP, with the idea to showcase the musical concept in order to find fulltime members for a complete lineup. In the process the material progressed into a fullenght and the drummer Stilian Tabakov joined the band.

The debut album "Drawbacks & Benefits" was released november, 2010. It features 11 instrumental tracks of experimental metal incorporating ambient, trip hop and fusion elements. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mindfold+Express">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
