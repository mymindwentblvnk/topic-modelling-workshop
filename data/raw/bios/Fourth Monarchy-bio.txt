Fourth Monarchy was formed on February 2002 by Lohengrin and Lord Emhyn. After spending two years by playing covers of the old Scandinavian Black Metal bands, Fourth Monarchy published the first 15 minutes demo-tape, called "Solstitium", and published by Count David's Militia Templi Records on April 2004. After this demo-tape, Count David got behind the microphone and behind the bass. After promoting the demo-tape with some live-shows (the most important show took place in the pub "Il Blocco music Hall" at S.Giovanni Lupatoto, Verona) Lohengrin and Count David started to compose 9 new tracks. It took two more years to compose the new album, which was recorded on May-June 2007 at DJ Leno Studios (Mirano-VE, Italy). On August 2008, Fourth Monarchy signed for the russian label Helvete.ru, which published the new album, called "Amphilochia", on November 2007.
Fourth Monarchy are now promoting the album. Some live shows are likely to take place within 2008. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fourth+Monarchy">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
