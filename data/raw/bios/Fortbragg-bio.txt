This heavy metal band from Japan, which existed between 1980-1991, is probably best known for having vocalist Masatoshi "Sho" Ono as their frontman. In September 1989, the band released their first and only, self-titled, demo tape. A year later, in July, they released a self-titled EP on Bronze Age Records. In 2010, Masatoshi joined Galneryus. The drummer from Fort Bragg, Ichiro "Val" Nagai, eventually joined Ark Storm, but also played in Concerto Moon (1997-2001) and was a support member of Granrodeo. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fortbragg">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
