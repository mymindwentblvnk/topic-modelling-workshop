Formed in 2012 , the Spanish Black/Thrash Metal band NUCLEAR REVENGE from Vitoria-Gasteiz, Basque Country, combines perfectly the mayhemic sounds of 80's Teutonic Thrash Metal with the unholy Australian Black/Thrash scene. With their second album “Dawn of the Primitive Age”, you'll listen to some highly influenced tunes from bands like old school KREATOR, SODOM, DESTRÖYER 666, SLAYER, and POSSESSED! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nuclear+Revenge">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
