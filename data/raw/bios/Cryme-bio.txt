Daniel Fagerström (Skull Defekts/Optic Nest/Et al) and Mattias Gustafsson (Altar of Flies/Jam Session/Et al) - is a founder of band Cryme - with their sophomore grooving, tape loop dancehall. Like Cabaret Voltaire's retarded cousin being escorted by the Residents, Cryme stumbles around their arsenal of analog synthesizers, drum computers and reel-to-reel's with drooling sexuality and single-minded obsession. Industrial music for 'Special' people…?
Cassette - 'Mekonium' (2013) on 'Beläten', Sweden (belaten.se) - (Post Avantgarde Pop), Cryme offering almost 25 minutes grooving, and tape looping. Cryme if continue to work, awaiting a great future. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cryme">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
