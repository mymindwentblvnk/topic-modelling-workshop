elbicho is a Spanish rock/flamenco band. Formed in the streets of Madrid, elbicho began to make a huge fanbase because of their creative way of fusing “flamenco bulerías and tanguillos with an array of diverse styles such as progressive rock, african rhythms and a touch of jazz.”

They met at the “Escuela Popular de Música” with Gullermo McGill, a renowned flamenco percussionist as its music workshop director.
