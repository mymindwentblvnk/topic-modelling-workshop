From Indian Lakes is an American indie rock band founded by Joey Vannucchi in early 2009. Vannucchi began songwriting in a small mountain community just outside Yosemite National Park and later enlisted the help of friends to perform his material. From Indian Lakes independently released "The Man With Wooden Legs" in the winter of 2009. However, it was the band’s sophomore album “Able Bodies” that gained acclaim when it was released independently in 2012. Vannucchi continues to evolve the band's sound into music that “blurs the boundaries of genres like indie, post-rock and alternative." Their third album, "Absent Sounds," was released on October 7, 2014 via Triple Crown Records, followed by a handful of EPs, and, eventually, their fourth and most recent album, "Dimly Lit," independently released on October 18, 2019. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/From+Indian+Lakes">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
