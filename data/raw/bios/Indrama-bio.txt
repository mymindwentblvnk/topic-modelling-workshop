InDrama began to take shape in 2008, after years of reflexion by Jesús, the groups’ main creator. From here the other members of the group came together to help create InDrama’s distinctive sound. The music evokes life’s dramatic nature and powerful emotions . Their emotive melodies and harmonies bring the expessiveness of the music close to all listeners.

Each of the band’s members has brought their own personal character and expression to the group, it’s music, concepts, and aesthetics. Indrama has become a focussed and well-defined project.

Indrama’s musical influences come from many different bands, but Anathema and The Gathering are clear references. However, they constantly search for new sounds, from inside and outside the group to make their music more expressive.
