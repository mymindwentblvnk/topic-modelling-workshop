Dagalur was formed in the spring of 2006 by two friends living in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Gorgamin(Guitars/Vocals) and Sorg(Vocals/Keyboards) began recording soon after the formation of the band and before long a self recorded a mixed track, The Halls of Mandos, was released. Since then, Dagalur have been joined by drummer Innblit Mennesklig and have continued recording. The band is currently planning their first album entitled: Wandering Darkness. The band is heavily influenced by old school black metal bands like Burzum, Immortal and Mayhem aswell as folk/viking metal bands such as Summoning. Dagalur's lyrics are heavily based on the series of Tolkein books aswell as Norse mythology.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dagalur">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
