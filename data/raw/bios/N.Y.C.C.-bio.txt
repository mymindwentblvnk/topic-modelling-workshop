Despite taking the name N.Y.C.C. the hip-hop/dance trio consisting of Phil, Dominic and Chris were actually from Germany. They only released one album titled "Greatest Hits" in 1998, but had several hits in parts of Europe with singles such as "Fight For Your Right" (a Beastie Boys cover), "Highway To Hell" (a AC/DC cover) and "Can You Feel It (Rock Da House)". Other covers featured on their album were "I Need Love" (LL Cool J) and "We Will Rock You" (Queen). All songs were recorded and produced by Dee Jay SÃ¶ren. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/N.Y.C.C.">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
