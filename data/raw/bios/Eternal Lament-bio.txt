Eternal Lament is a Melodic Black Metal band from Bogotá, Colombia. They were formed in the year of 1998, releasing one demo and one album. They are currently under the record label "E.L. Productions" a Colombian label (Literally called "E.L. Producciones")

The band's lyrical themes are related to Poetry, Nature, Existence. They can be described as merely an Atmospheric, Philosophical band in the vein of Drudkh, which is often very uncommon for a Melodic Black Metal band.

In 2000, they released a demo entitled "Daybreak", which had three tracks, some of which were featured on their prior album. The lineup on this demo was a bit different from the current lineup but, has obviously been a promotional one - for them to be able to release a full-length album on their label. The 2003 album "Cold Shore of Silence" had ten tracks and has yet to been acknowledged.

The band is still been known to be currently active but, has been doing 'on and off' rehearsing. The last line up is; Jean Pierre Guzmán - Vocals, Davis Montenegro - Guitar, Fernando Romero - Guitar, Gino Montenegro - Bass , Freddy García - Keyboards and Gustavo Romero - Drums.
