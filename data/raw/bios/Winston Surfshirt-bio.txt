Originally a solo project by Winston Surfshirt, Winston Surfshirt is now an Australian 6-piece hip hop group based in Sydney. Citing John Lennon and Andre 3000 as their influences, Winston Surfshirt offers a soothing sensibility to hip hop, while injecting their own style to create a distinct and chilling sound.
The combination of soul and hip hop has allowed them to develop a cult following their smooth style and raucous live shows.
While cutting their teeth on the Sydney underground scene in 2014, Winston Surfshirt quickly won over a religiously loyal fan base. Thereafter, 2016 saw namesake Winston earn nods from Triple J and Majestic Casual for the buttery-smooth solo vocal feature he laid on Polographia’s hit track, ‘Sly’.
 In 2017  Sir Elton John touted them as "the stars of the show", counting himself a vocal fan. Other fans include Zane Lowe (Beats1), Jason Bentley (KCRW) and Huw Stephens (BBC Radio 1). After a shining start to the year supporting RÜFÜS on their Australian tour and Midnight Oil at their comeback show before their world tour, the band released two critically acclaimed singles - ‘Be About You and ‘Ali D’. With both singles drifting through radio speakers, stereos and headphones around the globe, it'd be hard to miss the rapid rise of Winston Surfshirt - 'Ali D' even nabbed most played track of the week on triple j for two consecutive weeks. Going on to sell out all 7 shows of their debut national tour, Winston rounded it off with a coveted spot on the renowned Splendour In The Grass bill.
