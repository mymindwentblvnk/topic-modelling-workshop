West Coast producer, MC and DJ Jesse Bru, draws full-bodied, impressionistic lines where less finessed artists draw blanks. Taking his creative cues from early-90’s sample-based hip hop, Bru’s deep house treatment remains decidedly modern – and mighty soulful. He also moonlights as one half of Vancouver duo Hot Keys (alongside Ryan Trann). His sample-strong debut album, MidCity (2012) on UK label Audio Parallax finds his sharp, fluttering grooves laced with hints of cut-up jazz, dubby acoustics and celestial vocals. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jesse+Bru">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
