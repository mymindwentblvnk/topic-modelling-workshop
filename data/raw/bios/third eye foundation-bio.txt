The Third Eye Foundation is Matt Elliott from Bristol, UK. In the early nineties, Elliott was an occasional member of fellow Bristolians Flying Saucer Attack and AMP. The name Third Eye Foundation first appears on Flying Saucer Attack's self-titled first album, where he receives credits on several tracks. As guitarist, drummer, programmer and viola player, he appears on several of AMP's early records, two of which are released on Elliott's own label, Linda's Strange Vacation (the name taken from an early Bristol band that featured many members that would later appear in bands like Crescent, Light, Philosopher's Stone and AMP). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Third+Eye+Foundation">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
