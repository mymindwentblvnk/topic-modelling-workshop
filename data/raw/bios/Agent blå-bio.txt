Their name translates in English to Agent blue, which may sound caustic, indeed it was the go to arsenic in the Middle Ages, the Renaissance and for Agatha Christie and the Borgias, but it is known as an exceedingly stable compound. It's a fitting name for a band whose music is anything but sweet. Their brand of indie pop has particularly dark overtones. It is also bursting with the exuberance of youth, their sound is packed full of emotion: hope, frustration, and everything in between.
