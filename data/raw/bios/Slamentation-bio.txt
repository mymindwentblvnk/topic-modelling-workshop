Slamentation was formed in 2009 as a project. As from the start, Livio (CH) and Morten (D) had exactly the same idea to create brutal, aggressive and slamming tunes. They recorded a few songs together before Andreas "Blixish" Jacobssen (NOR) joined in 2010. The first 4 songs of Livio and Morten are released in the form of an EP. The EP was released on the 14th of may, 2011. Though the EP was being released, Blix already started recording his vocals for the new songs. Slamentation is a non studio project, which means all the recordings are done with semi-professional home tools. All the members are from different countries, which would make a studio very expensive. In the middle of 2011 Blix left the project due to personal projects.
