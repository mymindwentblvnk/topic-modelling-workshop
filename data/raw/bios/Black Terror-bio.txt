Black Terror is the name of at least 3 bands, Amebix-like crust one a black metal one and one is a indie pop.

I don't know that much about the one that is a Metal.

The one that is a Indie Pop is based out of Bristol, England and Toronto, Canada, but not both at the same time as there is only one person.
