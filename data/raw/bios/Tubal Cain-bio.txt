Tubal Cain met DJ Stix and Misty Woods on London's electro and goth scene. Stix and Misty had been working as a duo under the name Juju Babies, and Tubal Cain offered to produce their first demo in his  studio under Oceanide Productions. An exciting working relationship began, which continues today. They were joined by Tubal Cain's sister, Nat Neon, who contributed guitar and co-production. From this was born the Juju Babies.
At the time, Tubal Cain was also known by the pseudonym Eros Ranredd.

Tubal Cain developed the original sound of the Juju Babies through a combination of live set-up and rich pre-recorded backing, which included layered voices, Classical chorale, and gated guitars and raucous synth. The JJBs musical approach was experimental and expressionist; they employed rapid recording techniques and performance to create a sense of immediacy, spontaneity and 'ordered chaos'.
