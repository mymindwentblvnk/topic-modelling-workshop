Saint Deamon is a Swedish/Norwegian band  (named after a fictive ghost rider called S. Deamon) that was formed in 2006 by drummer Ronny Milianowicz after a 7 year long successful era with Swedish/German melodic metal band Dionysus. 

He rejoined his forces with Dionysus bass player Nobby Noberg, which Ronny describe as "The best bass player in the business", along with the exceptional guitar virtuoso Toya Johansson, which Ronny knew back from their studying together at the University Of Music, in Ã–rebro Sweden. 

The band scanned the whole internet to find a singer that would do their magnificent music justice and in the spring of 2008, they finally found the ultra talented voice of gold, Norwegian Jan Thore Grefstad, most known for his impressive singing in Norwegian power metallers Highland Glory and for being the singer in TNT guitarist Ronnie Le Tekro's second band Wild Willy's Gang, a position he took over after Jorn Lande. 

The Saint Deamon line up was then complete and started to work on the debut album, under the guidance of the high acclaimed monster producer Jens Bogren, best known for his excellent work with Symphony X, Hammerfall, Opeth, Katatonia and Dionysus. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Saint+Deamon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
