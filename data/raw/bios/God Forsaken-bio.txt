God Forsaken is a death/doom metal band from Ylistaro, Finland. Musically God Forsaken play death/doom-metal with a slightly groovy edge. Heavy songs and riffing is mixed with more melodic intersections and a slight rock 'n roll feel. The grunts and distorted guitars keep the band within the realm of death/doom metal however. The band made original music that can at times be compared to early My Dying Bride ('As the Flower Withers' era).
Several lineup changes struck the band to which it after all ended in around 2003-2004. Reunited as of 2020. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/God+Forsaken">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
