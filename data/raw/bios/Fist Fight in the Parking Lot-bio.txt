Fist Fight in the Parking Lot ~ Pennsylvania
Doom Metal, Hard Rock/Female Fronted
 
When Fist Fight released their self-titled debut album in February 2012, they appeared battle tested and bloody, with guitar driven tracks, concise, and radio ready.  With 'Year of the Ox' the effect of the aural assault is the same, but with a far darker approach where Fist Fight in the Parking Lot find themselves paying respects to their heavy contemporaries while managing to keep their own voice. 
 
The album opens with “The Ox,” a title fitting for the sludgy, six minute giant, unrelenting until it reaches it's harmonious guitar driven apex. Fist Fight is full of surprises in 'Year of the Ox,' as the album finds a way to move gracefully from hard hitting venom-spitting, snarling, tracks like “Horsemouth” to soaring guitars and hypnotically haunting vocals in “Natural Fool.” 
 
Written and produced by Fist Fight in the Parking Lot, and engineered, mixed, and mastered by drummer Chris Ruane, 'Year of the Ox' is grass roots, do-it-yourself recording without showing it's seams.  Fueled by whiskey.  Enjoy.
