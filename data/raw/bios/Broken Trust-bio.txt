Broken Trust – Mainstream Rock with a Southern Flair 


Formed in 2008, Broken Trust is a band of four friends from a small town in North Florida called Perry. We are rapidly gaining followers and fans by playing shows in area bars and events on a weekly basis. Our recently released self titled cd, has helped promote our band considerably and has sold an impressive 500 copies. Our unique stage presence has provided us the opportunity to share the stage with some of today’s biggest rock acts including: Sevendust, Soil, Trust Company, Socialburn, Presence, Union Underground, Eric Durrance, Egypt Central, Nonpoint and many more Regional and local acts. We feel honored to have shared our music with residents of cities where we have preformed.. 

What sets us apart from other bands is our unique take on our music. Our music is best described as a combination of traditional rock and hard rock with a Southern twist. The sounds of Black Sabbath, Pink Floyd, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Hank Williams Jr and Guns & Roses to Nickelback, Godsmack, Creed and Tool have all had an impact on our distinctive style. We are true storytellers through the use of our lyrics and instruments. Whether you enjoy ballads or a hard-driving riff, you are bound to be able to personally relate to at least one of our songs on our cd. 

Broken Trust has big dreams. Our goal is to have our music played as much as possible, allowing new listeners the opportunity to join in our passion and appreciation for music and storytelling. We are committed to working as hard and as long as it takes to reach this goal.
