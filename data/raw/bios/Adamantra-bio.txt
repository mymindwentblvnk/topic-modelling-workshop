Adamantra is a Helsinki, Finland based heavy metal group.

The band formed in 2003 when bass player Jukka Hoffrén started recording some of his tunes and ideas on a friends computer. As the songs started to find their final shape during the process of preproduction, it was time to form a band to perform the music.
Regardless of placing numerous ads on music magazines and sites, a fitting line-up was somewhat difficult to create. Nevertheless, the solution could be found closer than one could suspect. Tuomas Nieminen, Tommi Ahtila and Panu Kiskola were already familiar from earlier bands and line-ups. Plans of forming a high-quality melodic metal band with drummer Mikko Sepponen also dated way back. All in all, the Adamantra line-up includes musicians from such bands as Bride Adorned, TOC, Craydawn, Divercia, Mind-A-Stray, Olympos Mons, Thaurorod..
Influences of progressive metal greats Symphony X, Dream Theater and Shadow Gallery can be heard in the music of Adamantra, as well as traces of more traditional power metal in the vein of Blind Guardian and Rhapsody.
