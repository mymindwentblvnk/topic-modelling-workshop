Destination are a boy/girl synth-pop duo based in the UK. They came into being in the summer of 2008 when a chance meeting between Glynn and Bridget resulted in their collaboration on a cover of one of their favourite songs. The response they received to this track prompted them to take the “project” farther and a prolific songwriting partnership was quickly and easily established.

While undeniably taking their lead from electronica giants like Yazoo, Depeche Mode and Erasure, the pair also cites the influence of a wide range of artists as diverse as Nick Cave and Ladytron, Massive Attack and Alabama3. This fusion of the vintage and the modern, results in a sound that is, at once, classic and contemporary.
