Slow, loud, heavy -- this is Khemmis, a four piece doomed rock 'n' roll outfit from Denver, Colorado. 
Khemmis combines the soul of Black Sabbath, the soaring harmonies of Thin Lizzy and Iron Maiden, and the visceral weight of contemporary sludge and doom metal. 

No regurgitation. No gimmicks. No trends. 

In July 2015, the band released Absolution, a six track, forty-minute journey through transcendent melodies and pure auditory annihilation. Recorded with Dave Otero (Cobalt, Primitive Man) and Shane Howard at Flatline Audio, the album earned praise from listeners and critics alike. Decibel Magazine named it the #9 metal album of 2015, while Pitchfork named it their #5 release of the year. It earned accolades from NPR, Apple Music, Invisible Oranges, Noisey, and No Clean Singing, among others. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Khemmis">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
