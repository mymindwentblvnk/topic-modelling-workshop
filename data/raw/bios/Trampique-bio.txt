Trampique is Volor Flex's new alias. "Face to Face" is the 12-tracks long album best described by the man himself: 

"Trampik is this place in my hometown, where I go when I want to be alone. My close friends know that if I'm missing, they can find me there.

This album is about one year of my life. 2013 was very emotional and complex, each month has left a distinct print on my life. I had a lot of very difficult moments. I tried to translate them all into music. I made an album that describes this heartbreaking year." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Trampique">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
