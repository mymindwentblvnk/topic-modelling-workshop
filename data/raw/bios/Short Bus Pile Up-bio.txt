Short Bus Pile Up started as a joke back in the winter of 2005. After realizing he wanted to do more as a musician, Tyler Sharpes (vocals) decided to take the band in a bit more serious direction. He contacted David Dement (drums), who he knew through friends and failed bands alike. Knowing this was the perfect opportunity to get the band rolling, Tyler asked his co-worker Elliott Ferguson (guitar) if he wanted to play death metal. After agreeing the band now had the core of two guitarists, and a drummer. Logan Karkenny was then added as vocalist because of his deeper guttural vocals. The 4 piece made several songs but felt that it was empty. After playing a show in VA Beach in the fall of 2007, Chris Albright who had given them a ride to this show, was added to bass. The band began writing and after several shows, they later released the "Putrid Pelvic Prolapse EP" in February 2008. In September 2008 the band hit the rocks. Chris left on good terms, for personal reasons and the band had lost several different practice spots, due to separate issues. After a bit of downtime, Ryan Olson (bass) was recruited to play bass and had an empty basement for practice. This set them in the right direction and allowed Short Bus to start writing again. With a little bit more turbulence, Logan also ended up leaving on good terms, leaving the band without a vocalist for the upcoming planned tour, and the recording of the band's next release. With a bit of quick rearrangements and practice, Tyler decided to take the helm as vocalist.
With the new member changes and solid sound, the four piece is now pushing forward and writing brutal death metal with nothing holding them back. The current lineup is Tyler on vocals, David on drums, Elliott on guitar, and Ryan on bass. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Short+Bus+Pile+Up">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
