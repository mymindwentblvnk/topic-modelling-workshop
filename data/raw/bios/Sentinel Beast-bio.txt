Sentinel Beast was formed in Sacramento, Ca in 1984 by Debbie Gunn (vocals), Mike Spencer (bass), and Scott Awes (drums). During this time, the axes were played by Greg Williams and Jerry Fraiser, later to be replaced by Barry Fischel and Mark Koyasako. Discovered by Kerry King of Slayer, the band recorded and released the influential Depths of Death album, on Metal Blade Records, in 1986. Beast opened up for the likes of Slayer, Exodus, Megadeth, Mercyful Fate, King Diamond, and others. The band broke up when Mike Spencer joined Flotsam and Jetsam, replacing Jason Newsted upon his departure to Metallica. Debbie Gunn departed for Chicago shortly after to front Zn√∂white, then relocated to Europe to join the all female thrash pioneers, Ice Age. Sentinel Beast has returned with the belting vocals of Debbie Gunn, mind blowing guiutar work by Kenny Eckhart and Dana Lindstrom, savage bass by Nic "Atomica X" Atamaniuk, and the fresh drum attacks of Scott Fuller. Watch for the reissue with bonus tracks on Evil Legend Records.
