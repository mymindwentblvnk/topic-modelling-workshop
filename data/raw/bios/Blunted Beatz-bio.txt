Blunted is a Hamburg City based HipHop music producer team (Dave White & Faded).

Inspired by the early Dilla and Madlib sound, we started doing music in 2011. We bought a cheap keyboard and produced our first beats. From then on we never had a day off working on instrumentals and developing our sound. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Blunted+Beatz">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
