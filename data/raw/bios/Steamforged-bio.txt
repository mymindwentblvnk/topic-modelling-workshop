Steamforged is a progressive metal project that was founded by keyboardist and programmer Tyler Sherrill in 2010.

The project itself emerged from a long rooted love for music, and a desire to introduce his unique style to the world. He uses his songs to paint a mental picture, and wants the listeners to understand what he is trying to convey, but with their individual perspective.

Tyler has been playing keyboard for upwards of 22 years, and has developed his style into a sound that has become something of it’s own. Each song is entirely composed by him, and each instrument, with the exception of keys, is programmed by him as well.

He is influenced by a myriad of musicians, some of which include:
Symphony X, Tyr, Ayreon, Cloudkicker, Benevolent,  Dali’s Dilemma, Darkwater, Devin Townsend, Circus Maximus, Shadow Gallery, Silent Force, Royal Hunt, Saga, Stratovarius, Elysian, and Gru.

He hopes the music speaks to you, and that you’ll find yourself immersed in a sonic world of synchronous cacophony. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Steamforged">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
