Sannhet is an instrumental post-metal/atmospheric black metal band based in Brooklyn, NY that formed in 2010. They have released three full-length albums, as well as a variety of singles and EPs that were re-released in their 2016 compilation album Young Death. 

In mid-2011, they released a three-song EP. In the fall of 2011, bassist/visual artist AJ Annunziata joined the band. They have since amassed a diehard audience within Brooklyn’s broad underground music circuit through their abundant live performances throughout the borough, always choreographed with electrifying visuals.

Known Flood, Sannhet’s sprawling debut LP, features nearly forty-five minutes of their electrified post-metal, fueled with domineering riff-building movements and intense percussive hostility, unifying in a slightly blackened and trance-inducing atmospheric style, captured by Colin Marston (Krallice, Behold… The Arctopus, Dysrhythmia) and mastered by Carl Saff. The album was released on vinyl by Sacrament Records, a label created by the Brooklyn venue Saint Vitus Bar, and on CD by Belgian label ConSouling Sounds.

In November 2014, Sannhet announced that they've signed with Flenser Records and will be releasing their second album, Revisionist, on March 3, 2015. As quoted from The Flenser's website, "The 9-track LP is a dizzying concoction of math-metal intricacy, prismatic pop shimmer, and dense metallic crush, taking the metalgaze sound of like minded modern metal combos like Deafheaven or Alcest and adding more dynamic indie rockisms and churning noise rock crunch."

The band released their third full length So Numb in 2017. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sannhet">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
