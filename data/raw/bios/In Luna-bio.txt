In Luna is a two-piece post-black metal band made up of Aukka (Silence Of The Old Man) and U. Lavin (CrystalMoors). The duo describe their work as "grey and urban black metal" owing to the music's gloomy, introspective nature which derives inspiration from depressive black metal, shoegaze and post rock.
