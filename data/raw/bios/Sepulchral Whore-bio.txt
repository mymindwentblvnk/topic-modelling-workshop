Conceived from a necrotizing womb in the year of 2015, driven by the willingness to vomit sacrileges upon the corners of the globe.

Sepulchral Whore was raised by three old time friends, which always wanted to play extreme metal together someday, after their previous journeys in other extreme local bands (Beast Conjurator, R.I.P. Soldier, Stormblood and others) from their hometown: Recife/PE, Brazil.

Drafted under the straight influence of the 90's school of extreme metal, the morbid acrimony which comes from these iconic entities of death metal scenery inspires Sepulchral Whore to give their own contribution to keep this impure flame alive.

"Everlasting Morbid Delights" - Debut EP - is an insalubrious and rough example which will flow over repulsive themes of the metaphysical paradox, necrophilia, anti-humanism, atheism, hedonistic-nihilism, and many other acts of darkened whisperings.
