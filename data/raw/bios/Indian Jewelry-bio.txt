Indian Jewelry was an American band from Houston, TX, established 2002/2004. The band is now known as Studded Left. 

Known for their vision music and stage show, the band has gone through several touring incarnations as Hong Kong, the Turquoise Diamonds, BENZENE LOTION RASH, the Corpses of Waco, Electric Fuck All, NTX+ELECTRIC, and the Perpetual War Party Band, among others. According to their website, they come from a Swarm of Angels.

Like other underground bands and their psychedelic rock predecessors, Indian Jewelry were prone to sonic and comic experiment.

"The most mind-controlling band I ever saw was Indian Jewelry. During a set at the Echo [several] years ago, they found some top-secret dial on the back of their synthesizer and slowly started turning up the insanity, pounding away at the same unrelenting riff until a roomful of people was twitching and frothing at the mouth. So you could say I’ve got high hopes for this appearance at Part Time Punks’ anniversary show. These weaponsgrade Texan psychedelicists match truly primitive electronics, rhythms like Konono N°1, bleeps and wooshes from some kind of Soviet radar system, etc., to unending slo-mo distorto guitar that fills the room like boiling oil and ghost vocal" - Chris Ziegler, LA Weekly <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Indian+Jewelry">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
