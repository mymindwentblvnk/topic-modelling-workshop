My real name is Paul White, and I was born in Cleveland, Ohio on October 10, 1988. After living in a foster home for three years in Akron, I was adopted and moved back to Cleveland. I lived there ever since, and although I spend a lot of time in Toronto these days, Cleveland is still home – I look for every chance to represent C-town.

Why Toronto? Well, if you had the chance to work with one of the best up-and-coming producers in game, you’d take it right? I did. Freeze and I have great chemistry in the studio, where we spend at least a few hours every day recording. We have tremendous respect for each other’s talent, and we push each other to keeping getting better and better. My manager Sam is also from Toronto, so I guess you could say Toronto is like my home away from home.

When describing my music, I would say it’s very personal. Just about every experience I’ve had over the last few years is represented in my music. Lyrically, I am known to make people laugh, think and feel good. I try to write songs that transport my fans to another place.

My influences? Everything. Pop, Rock, Soul, Funk, Rap, Country, etc. And I’m not only talking about new music, I grew up on the classics. I’m a walking music encyclopedia, and I hope it shows.

Most musicians will tell you that they have their own sound, but 99% don’t. Fortunately, that’s one of the most common things I hear about myself, that “Doxx has really developed his own sound.” In reality, I just make music the way it sounds good to me. I like to try new things musically, and my fans have been really supportive thus far. They’re the reason why I keep pushing forward. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Doxx">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
