Fenech-Soler is a band from Kings Cliffe, United Kingdom, that formed around 2006. The band consists of Ross Duffy & Ben Duffy, while Daniel Soler & Andrew Lindsay departed band amicably.

They released their debut album Fenech-Soler on September 27th 2010 on B-Unique. It's an album that begins with a blast, its opener "Battlefields" launching with a heavenly chorus of voices, "Golden Sun" plays with rhythms that summon up the sultriness of desert heat; "The Great Unknown" takes a distant echo on French House in new, dizzying directions. And of course "Stop And Stare" play-listed at Radio 1 in May 2010, and reached Top 10 of the Dance and Indie singles chart.
"Lies" is their most famous song so far.
