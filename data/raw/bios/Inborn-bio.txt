Combining innovative songwriting with the experimentations of progressive music and the dynamics of modern hardcore structures, Inborn have forged their own path far from the musical trends of their time. Largely inspired by modern architecture and the artistic landscapes of the bizarre, the band always displayed a will to put their ambitions into concepts and design-oriented patterns.
During a short period of introspection following the release of their first record ‘The Headtrance Session’ in 2005, they turned away from what had been considered as ‘experimental headtrance rock’ to invest their energy into a new sound, closer to the frenetic choreography of their live performances.
As a logical consequence, their sophomore effort, modestly entitled ‘Chef d’Oeuvre’, offered improved compositions and a more authentic concept. In the months that followed its early 2007 release, the experimental noise-rock outfit started performing in Germany, where the album had earned constructive critics from the press.
In the aftermath of a secret recording taking place in late 2008, the band decided to push their sound into new territories creating a style labelled by some critics as ‘21st century dance rock’ or even ‘progressive disco’. The new material unfolds violent and danceable soundscapes that encompass pop culture and the rules that shape it. In accordance to this renewed attitude, the past months led the band to planning a collective existence, considering music as a full-time activity. INBORN! will again be entering the studios on october 1st, 2010, for a third album.
In the wake of next year’s turn, you won’t be able to see ‘The Graduate’ or the occasional Saturday night porn with the same eyes ever again. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Inborn">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
