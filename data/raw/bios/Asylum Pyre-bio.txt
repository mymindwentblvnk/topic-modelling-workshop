Asylum Pyre is a French metal band. 

Mixing influences and styles, Asylum Pyre can't be shut in a closed and predefined universe. From Speed Metal to Progressive, passing through Lyrical or ambiant Metal, Asylum Pyre draws elements from multiple genres in the way to create its own identity. This band's originality is to build songs around catchy melodies and rythms breaks that alternates quiet parts and powerful tempos. The result is both swinging and poignancy for one of the force of Asylum Pyre lays in the messages expressed in its songs. 

All the tracks are then well thought and offer a succession of simples and complexes parts, where melodies and lyrics, sung by the original voices of Elodie and Johann, carry senseful messages all the way through.
