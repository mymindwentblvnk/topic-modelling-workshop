THE END OF ALL REASON is a five piece modern death metal band from Brussels, Belgium, spawn in the wake of 2004. So far, 2008 has been a productive year for this evergrowing metalmachine: A new drummer, a record deal with IFORUS Records and the recording of the long awaited EP entitled: FRAGMENTED

Recorded by Aborted's Sven Janssens and mastered at Hertz Studios (Decapitated, Vader, Kronos...), Fragmented further explores the band's boundaries while maintaining and improving the ferocity and passion they are known for. The effort contains 5 songs and has a playtime of about 28 minutes!

The band had allready started writing the record in the summer of 2007 but due to a line up change and some technical problems, the recordings were postponed over and over. However, during this last year, TEOAR kept on evolving, and every song underwent a complete metamorphosis. New lyrics were written to match the 'man vs machine' theme of this EP.

Over the years, TEOAR has shared the stage with numerous bands from The Black Dahlia Murder and Aborted to All Shall Perish, Burning Skies and Sylosis. With their new line up and EP they are all set to bring the storm.
Influenced by bands like Dissection, Neuraxis, Anata, Spawn of Possession, Decapitated, Keep of Kalessin, Opeth, Wintersun, etc. the band delivers a refreshing form of melodic death metal with a technical edge which will be further explored on future efforts. As we speak, THE END is in full writing mode for a first full length album. No further information will be released about that for now, except that it will be a huge, epic concept album...
