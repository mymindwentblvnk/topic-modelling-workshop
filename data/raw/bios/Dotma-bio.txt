Female-fronted symphonic power metal band from Hyvinkää, Finland.

BIOGRAPHY

It was year 2005 when a group of friends decided to form a band that was to be THE power metal band of all time. The idea to the lyrics lay deep within the mysteries of The Middle Ages, you know, in the time when the wild era of mighty dragons still prevailed. The aim was likewise to create pompous and captivating harmonies in the melodies from one to another. The band started to gain its form slowly but still certainly (well, not always that certainly) and in the autumn 2006 the member set-up was finally stable. Rehearsal place became their second home and the setlist kept on increasing. 

Soon it was the time for recording their first promo cd and so DOTMA stepped into the studio in August 2007. After recordings of the promo cd including 3 songs were finished, band gained fame not only in the local store that was situated in the upstairs to the rehearsal place (poor cashiers..) but now also elsewhere. Emphasis, medieval themes and just a hint of humour and self-irony have been along their journey as far as today. When all this is combined with beautiful and limbid female vocals and a hint of epic flavour and even more power - not to mention the awesome spirit - there is only one result: A metal band that will certainly not loose any of their battles!!
