There are three different artists called Atman, one from Brazil other from Poland and another from Spain.

ātman (with all lowercase letters and macron) is a music project started in 1996 by Robert Skèpis (born 1968, São Paulo, Brazil).
It explores the boundaries within and between traditional and contemporary music genres making use of field recordings, improvisation, experimental techniques and electronic production.
Skèpis works across genres, often using traditional world music samples and concepts, against soft electronic instrumentation to produce tracks that sound odd and familiar at the same time.
The music of ātman is mostly categorized as world fusion, downtempo, chillout and ambient.

Polish experimental ethno-folk collective Atman was formed in 1981 by multi-instrumentalists Marek Styczynski, Marek Leszczynski and Piotr Kolecki, who remained the core of the group throughout its lengthy existence; other regular collaborators included vocalist Anna Nacher and Tomek Gulinski, as well as bassist Thomasz Radziuk. Forging an aesthetic they dubbed "forest music" – a sound created with acoustic instruments and Tibetan instruments – the members of Atman divided their time between performing and offering workshops in instrument building and forestry, finally releasing the cassette …jak rozrzucone po ziemi kamienie… on their own FLY (Freak Living Yourself) label in 1991. Cassettes including Soundreams and Gadajaca Laka followed before Atman made its American debut with the Drunken Fish EP Save the Earth; other efforts for the label include 1997's Personal Forest and 1999's Tradition.

The Spanish black metal band ATMAN:
Consisted of only 2 members (Darshan – instruments, vocals, Damastor - drums), was established back in 1992 in Barcelona, Spain/Catalunia.
1996 welcomes the debut album Like Pure Unawaited Magic (recorded in 1994!).
13 years later, this is the 4th full-length of this mystical duo, bringing magickal black metal which stands far from the actual underground movements, trends. Hard to compare to other (black metal) bands, ATMAN can be best described as solid black metal with lyrics oriented to vedic philosophy & magick.
Expect uncompromising & raw, but melancholic black metal at a mostly straight-forward tempo filled with several acoustic interludes.
L'Assassí de Venus was released on vinyl in December 2008 by Ishtadeva Vinyl Productions, being edited on CD only in 2009 under license from IVP.
