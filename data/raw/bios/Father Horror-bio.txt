Started in the summer of 2009, Father Horror is a death metal band from Dayton, Ohio.  They came together as a band intending to bring american death metal to the masses via their signature head-banging, chest-pounding, face-smashing style. Their music video for "Morbid Desire" is quickly becoming viral in the undergound metal scene. 2010 has high hopes for Father Horror. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Father+Horror">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
