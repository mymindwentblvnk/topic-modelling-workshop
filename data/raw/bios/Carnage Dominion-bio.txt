Death metal band with Thrash metal and HC elements combined with fast shredding riffs, brutal vocals and chaotic blast beats. In 2010 the band released a demo single on YouTube (Drown in Your Own Blood) under the old band name "Carnage". Later on in 2011 the band released a single also by the old name. The single is called "Invisible Oppression".
Later on they changed their name to Carnage Dominion, because of the frequency of the name Carnage. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Carnage+Dominion">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
