Tim ‘Ripper’ Owens, born as Timothy S. Owens on September 13, 1967 in Akron, Ohio. The young Ohio salesman and tribute band frontman made headlines in 1996 when from a fan he became the frontman for the British metal act Judas Priest, filling the shoes of Rob Halford (and, by doing so, inspired the movie Rock Star, which was later discredited by the band). Despite numerous rumours that Rob Halford would reunite with Judas Priest, Owens recorded two studio albums with his childhood heroes, as well as two live albums and a 2002 DVD release.

Prior to joining Judas Priest in 1996, Owens was frontman of a heavy metal band called Winters Bane, with who he recorded an album called Heart Of A Killer in 1993. He also was the frontman of Judas Priest tribute band British Steel.

Judas Priest reunited with Rob Halford in 2003. That same year the frontman for Iced Earth quit the band and Owens became the new lead singer for them after leaving Judas Priest. Iced Earth’s first album with Owens, The Glorious Burden, came out in early 2004.

Recently, Tim reunited with his former Winter’s Bane colleague Dennis Hayes in a band called Beyond Fear. The self-titled debut album from this new band was released in May 2006.

In December 2007, Owens was fired from Iced Earth to be replaced with former singer Matt Barlow.

On February 19th, 2009, Owens revealed that his first solo album, Play My Game, will be out in May. The album features many prominent metal musicians.

Recently took part in a band Charred Walls of the Damned with Richard Christie. He also sang for Yngwie Malmsteen and Dio Disciples. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tim+Ripper+Owens">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
