2814 (formerly known as ２８１４) is a collaborative project of original ambient vaporwave music by t e l e p a t h テレパシー能力者 and HKE (formerly known as Hong Kong Express), the owners of Dream Catalogue. Their debut album entitled ２８１４ was released October 25, 2014 as a free download on Ailanthus Recordings.

Their second album entitled 新しい日の誕生 was released January 21, 2015 on Dream Catalogue. It received a limited CD-R run of 50 copies as the label's first ever physical release. This album is the label's most popular album to date; it gained the label much recognition and has become one of the most popular vaporwave releases overall. 

The duo launched a campaign later in the year via Indiegogo in order to press the album on vinyl. 214 backers surpassed its goal within a month and it ended up 161% funded. They were able to press 1000 copies of 2xLP 180g vinyl and, with the help of Bleep/Warp, ship them out to buyers worldwide. Backers of the campaign were also able to choose a perk which included a reissue of the original cassette release, limited to 50 copies. Both the cassette and vinyl releases include a bonus track 余波. Finally, the album was repressed on cassette in 2016 by Not Not Fun, limited to 80 copies.

A mix entitled Room 2814 was released in September 2015 to thank people who pledged money towards helping fund the vinyl release of 新しい日の誕生 through the campaign held on Indiegogo during summer 2015.

A song titled "Impact" was released on March 6 – it is featured on the compilation Hardvapour..

On July 26, 2016, the project released their third album Rain Temple on Dream Catalogue in vinyl, cassette, CD, and digital formats.
