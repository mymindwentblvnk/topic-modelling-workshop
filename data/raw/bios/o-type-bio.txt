O-Type is the legendary art punk band MX-80 sans singer Rich Stim -- that is, Bay Area guitarist Bruce Anderson, percussionists Mark Weinstein and Dave Mahoney, Jim Hrabetin (guitar, bass) and Dale Sophiea who uses a sampler and mixer to shape the sonic emanations produced by the other four. Starting operation in 1985 as a Sophiea/Anderson duo, O-Type issued three cassettes and a CD through 1994 before entering hibernation. In 1998 O-Type expanded and began recording countless hours under The New Edge series banner, releasing five albums on Family Vineyard since 1999. O-Type often surpases levels of full-on abstraction, in terms of structure and melody, bending to fields of ambient distillation or jagged, electroid rhythm fragments. The New Edge pools together the members' three decades of musical research of minimalism, sound collage, music concrete, and composition into a body of work that stands above and without association with any current musical trends or scenes. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/O-Type">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
