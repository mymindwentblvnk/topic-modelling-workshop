Anavitória is a Brazilian musical duo formed in 2014 by Ana Clara Caetano Costa (Goiânia, October 5, 1994) and Vitória Fernandes Falcão (Araguaína, May 2, 1995).

The duo's debut album, Anavitória (2016), received diamond disc certification, selling more than 300,000 copies. In addition, their debut album received two Latin Grammy nominations, winning Best Song in Portuguese for "Trevo (Tu)". They released the autobiographical fiction feature "Ana e Vitória" (2018) and the second studio album "O Tempo É Agora" (2018), winner of the Latin Grammy for Best Contemporary Pop Album in Portuguese. Their third studio album, N (2019), consists of re-recordings of songs by singer Nando Reis and was produced by Tó Brandileone and Ana Caetano. Their fourth studio album, "Cor" (2021), had a surprise release on January 1st of 2021. It's their first independent album and it was recorded during quarantine. Cor is their most mature work yet, mostly because it's sonically fresh, laying low on the acoustic, characteristic of their first album and still evergreen on their second and third, and playing around with production, especially with chord instruments and drums. It was again produced by Ana Caetano and Tó Brandileone. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/ANAVIT%C3%93RIA">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
