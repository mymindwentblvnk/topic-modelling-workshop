Acid Mothers Temple & The Cosmic Inferno is one of many offshoots/permutations of Acid Mothers Temple & the Melting Paraiso U.F.O.. Acid Mothers Temple & the Cosmic Inferno differs from the Melting Paraiso U.F.O. not only in line-up but also in style of music. The Cosmic Inferno generally plays much heavier, hard-rock inspired psychedelia, and experiments more with effects pedals.
