Gynecrology is a one-man project, born in August 2002 in the country of "Molambaquia".

The first cd "Testiculartillery" is released in october 2002 as an instrumental death/grind project album. It was released on the internet only and distributed world-wide by some mp3 exchange programs. The succes of "Testiculartillery" was relatively good, due to it's free availability. 
Between january and march 2003, Gynecrology is contacted by several people who asked the band to be on split cds, compilation cds and the "GUT" tribute cd... The band has to refused those propositions because of the new songs composition...

In the end of march 2003, a singer has join his powerful growls to Gynecrology and the first "real" full lenght is in the recording process.

Gynecrology will now try to find some labels who might be interested by its powerful death/grind.
