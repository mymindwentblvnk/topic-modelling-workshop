There is more than one band that goes by the name Disarm, the two most prominent being a Swedish Hardcore/Punk band and a sleaze band from the UK.

1)  The Swedish Disarm was formed in Gothenburg, Sweden in the early eighties. They started under the name Total Armsvett but changed their name to Disarm under the recording of their first ep Regerings Stödda Mord. They played both in Sweden and in Finland with contemporary bands like Kaaos, Anti Cimex and Mob 47 to name a few. The band made two official ep´s "Regerings Stödda Mord" and "Dömd" and also appeared on the compilation "Really Fast 3." In the later 80's, the band recorded a lot of (as of yet) unreleased material, planned to be included on a Complete Discography on Hardcore Holocaust records in the near future.
