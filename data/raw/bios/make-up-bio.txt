MAKE-UP was a Japanese band responsible for the theme songs from the anime Saint Seiya "Pegasus Fantasy" (1st opening theme) and "Blue Forever" (1st ending theme).
The band also recorded three albums with songs inspired by the same anime: Saint Seiya Hits I, Saint Seiya Hits II and Saint Seiya 1996 Song Collection.

In 1984 they performed their first show and released their first two albums: Howling Will and Straight Liner.
In 1985, they released their third album Born to Be Hard and their fourth and final album Rock Legend of Boys and Girls.
In 1986, the band is invited by Columbia Records to sing the Saint Seiya theme songs. Pegasus Fantasy came to be one of the most well-known anime songs of all time.

After the Saint Seiya albums, the band split up and each member followed their own solo careers.

In 2004, Columbia Records released Make-Up 20th Anniversary Memories of Blue, a box that included five CDs and a live DVD, but no new song was recorded.
