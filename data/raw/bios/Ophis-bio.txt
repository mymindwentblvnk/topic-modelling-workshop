Ophis (greek for "serpent" or "snake"), began its lurking career in Hamburg, Germany, way back in the year 2000 as a solo-project of Rain of Ashes drummer Philipp as an outlet for his emotional downs and his deep love for depressing Doom Metal and Death Metal sounds. After this embryonic phase, Ophis grew to a full band in late 2001 with the line-up of Philipp on vocals and guitar, Fred on guitar, Johannes on bass and Richard on drums, but split up only after a few months without having played live or having anything released. Ophis lay down, inactive, rotting...

Until late 2002, when Philipp decided to resurrect the serpent, once more all on his own. An eight track demo CD was recorded; all instruments and vocals performed by himself, containing old and new songs, and released in November 2002. The demo hit huge success in the international underground scene and received overwhelming reviews in countless magazines across the globe. No wonder, that in the end of 2003, the decision was made to reform Ophis to a complete band again. Philipp took over the guitar and vocals again, once more with Richard Nolte on drums, reinforced by Jan on guitar and Chrille on bass, another Rain of Ashes member. The band played several gigs in Hamburg (including supporting Primordial), when Chrille decided to depart cause of musical differences. He was replaced by Torn to Pieces bassplayer Oliver.

What is Ophis all about? Well, it may be a clich√©, but Ophis is about suffering from life, about depression, about the all-day disappointments, about death and decay, about suicidal ambitions and the darkness that dwells in your soul. Just read the lyrics to find out for yourself.
Musically inspired by bands like My Dying Bride, Samael, Katatonia, Tiamat and Obituary, Ophis stands for a slow, heavy mixture of Doom Metal and Death Metal with an undeniable sadness and melancholy.
So enjoy the suffering and enter the realm of the serpent... Ophis is crawling among you.
