Dear loud music fan, Big Coffin Hunters are here to rock your socks, face, ass, or any other body part that needs rocking. * Big Coffin Hunters have worked very hard to NOT re-invent heavy metal / rock n' roll / whatever you want to call us. That's not to say that BCH doesn't have their own sound, but it's more of a twist or a signature on the last 30 years of heavy music that they love. They know what they like to listen to and what makes good rock n' roll, whether it's a 1970's Cheap Trick album, or the latest Trivium release. Their music is angry, dark, sarcastic, funny, and it's all the things you've come to expect from a band that grew up in the 80's, came of age in the 90's, and is now plowing through the disgruntled 2000's. * BCH have played rock venues from NY, NY (CBGB's) to Oakfield, ME. A live BCH show is display of working-class metal-heads who take their performances and their audiences seriously. They are loud. They are engaging. They are there to entertain, inspire, and otherwise rock your faces for your utmost pleasure. You'll be playing their CD in your car on the way to work the next Monday. You'll tell a friend about BCH, and ultimately, you'll be a fan for life!  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Big+Coffin+Hunters">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
