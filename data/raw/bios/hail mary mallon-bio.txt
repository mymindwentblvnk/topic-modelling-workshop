Hail Mary Mallon is a hip-hop group formed in 2009 by Definitive Jux rapper/producers Aesop Rock and Rob Sonic and formerly DJ Big Wiz. Their first officially released track, "D-Up", was featured on the 2009 compilation Def Jux Presents... Vol. 4. Their debut album 'Are You Going To Eat That', was released on the 3rd of May 2011. 

Their name refers to Mary Mallon or "Typhoid Mary", the first known healthy carrier of typhoid fever in the United States, who infected 53 people with the disease as she continued to work as a cook while denying she had it.

In April 2011 a teaser was released on Rhymesayers Entertainment's Youtube channel entitled 'Are You Gonna Eat That?". The video had no further description and was in actuality a teaser for Hail Mary Mallon featuring the 3 members seated around a table. While Rob Sonic is stirring some noodles, Aesop exclaims "Are You Going To Eat That?", after which the 3 artists names are mentioned and the name of the group itself. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hail+Mary+Mallon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
