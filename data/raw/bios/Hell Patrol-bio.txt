3)Hell Patrol is a one membered band for now. Alexander aka Necrolust is the composer and the drummer, the guitarist, the bassist, the keyboardist, the producer of this band.. Hell Patrol started at first as Soul Reaper but changed name cause Soul Reaper was already taken, there are lots and lots of songs and they are currently re-recorded for better quality and to add vocals. A new member joined from far away as an official lyricist of the band called Alonso Chavariaga aka Insideac, the co-operation is flowing nicely and the results are satisfying.
