Biography:

Tellusian came together in 2010 in the city of Malmö, Sweden. John Rönnerblad (Guitars) and Erik Hall (Drums) had been jamming around for a while, and after the demise of Crowpath the ideas of turning Tellusian into a proper "active" band started to grow. Robert Fuchs was added on bass and Henrik Ivarsson stepped in on vocals. A few demos was recorded and a split 7" with Chicago's The Swan King was released through Hell Comes Home in 2012 followed by the Scania 7" in 2013. Here we are in 2014 and the fist full length 'Collision' is upon us.
