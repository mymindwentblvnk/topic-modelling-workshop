THE BOMBS OF ENDURING FREEDOM is a new project of James Fogarty (formerly of Ewigkeit, and former founding member of The Meads of Asphodel)

Based at the Council Flat of Mass Destruction, this new project is a true product of the 21st century. The underground music alternative to CNN , 'The Bombs' present their own take on the world as it is presented to us through the 24hour media machine. 
The music could be described as Industrial ambient metal, with a message OR for the lazy, "Current Affairs Metal" ;-)

It's 2007, and the 24hr brainwashing media is in full effect spreading a climate of fear ; The gorge between fundamentalist lunatics in the East, and fundamentalist lunatics in the West has never been deeper. Daily death-tolls from the ever closer wargames of the brave new world grow increasingly higher and the religious suicide bombers are taking full advantage of budget airline travel... 

Deep in the suburbs of the UK's drug-death capital, a new underground project dubbed "THE BOMBS OF ENDURING FREEDOM" is born - not in a stable, but in the council-flat of mass destruction. The music is a collaboration of mid-paced Metal and ambient industrial and a bit more besides, sewn together by 'end times' tales of the 21st century and all with a D.I.Y punk ethic.
