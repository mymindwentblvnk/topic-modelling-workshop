Ignominious Incarceration are a fast-rising death metal band based in Bath in the UK. They have changed their name to The Soulless (Metalcore). This talented, young five-piece deliver an instantly recognizable, crushing, modern sound whilst being unmistakably rooted in traditional death metal.

Having only formed in 2006, Ignominious Incarceration are one fast-moving band.  Only six weeks after forming in a small town called Wellington, United Kingdom, the band played their first gig to a humble audience of around 20 people.  By the time the band played their third show, they had replaced Abigail Williams on a tour slot as the main support act for Bring Me The Horizon and were playing to over 400 people.

Since those early shows, Ignominious Incarceration have been moving at light-speed, both musically and in their progression as a band.  Quickly being tipped as one of the best new British death metal bands, they have toured with the likes of Trigger the Bloodshed and Bleed From Within, and have an unreleased 6-track EP under their belts.

In May 2008, only two years after forming, Ignominious Incarceration's hard-working ethic paid off as the band signed a worldwide record deal with extreme metal label, Earache Records.  Currently working on their debut album, the band are set to enter Grindstone Studios in Suffolk in September 2008 with producer Scott Atkins (Sylosis, Gama Bomb) for an early 2009 release, with touring scheduled for October 2008.
