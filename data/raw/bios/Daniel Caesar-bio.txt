Daniel Caesar is Canadian singer and songwriter Ashton Simmonds (born 5 April 1995 in Oshawa, Ontario).

After independently building a following through the release of two critically acclaimed EPs Praise Break (2014) and Pilgrim's Paradise (2015), Caesar released his debut album Freudian in August 2017, which also garnered widespread critical acclaim. On June 28th 2019, Daniel delivered his sophomore studio release entitled Case Study 01 to commercial and critical success.

As a singer-songwriter raised on the sounds of soul and gospel, his music draws from the experiences of his childhood and supplements them with a modern R&B and electronics while lyrics explore the subjects of religion and unrequited love. Caesar cites Frank Ocean, Kanye West and Beyonc√© and The Doors frontman Jim Morrison as sources of musical and aesthetic inspirations. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Daniel+Caesar">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
