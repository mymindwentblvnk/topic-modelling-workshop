Hail the Ghost are a three-piece alternative band from Ireland. They formed in early 2014 when singer/songwriter Kieran O'Reilly recruited Ã‰amonn Young (Guitars) and Ian Corr (Piano/Keys). The three have been writing and recording material since the turn of 2014 with Kieran O'Reilly producing alongside Martin Quinn of Jam Studios in Kells, Co. Meath. The result is "Forsaken", the bands debut album, which is due for release on March 6th, 2015. Hail the Ghost's sound hosts a prevalent brooding ambience intertwined with elegant piano, baritone vocals and a luring understated alt-rock quality.
Hail the Ghost released "Colony of Ants" on February 6th 2015. This is the second single to be taken from their forthcoming album, Forsaken.
