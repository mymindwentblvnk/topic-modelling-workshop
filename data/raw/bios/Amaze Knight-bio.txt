Amaze Knight formed in November 2010, in Turin, when Christian Dimasi (guitarist) and Michele Scotti (drummer) met. What truly makes the two want to work together, is their big passion for Music and the strong will to create and experiment with it, without any preconception. Not long after Christian and Michele meet, Fabrizio Aseglio (vocals) and Matteo Cerantola (bass player) join the band. Although they all come from different music backgrounds and genres, their affinity is perfect. They start composing their first songs, with the main aim of touching the listener and taking him to a world where melody and aggressiveness find a balance and a meeting point. That is how the recording of their first album, ‘The Key’, starts, with the collaboration of Sound Engineer and Producer Roberto Maccagno.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Amaze+Knight">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
