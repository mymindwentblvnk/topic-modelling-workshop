Avrigus are a 2 piece gothic doom metal band from Sydney, Australia. The band is composed of Simon Gruer (ex-Cruciform) and Judy Chiara. They play epic and majestic gothic doom metal with dark ambient passages.

Avrigus first came into existence in 1990. Due to Simon's role in Cruciform and the Sydney metal scene it wasn't until 1998 that the very well received EP The Final Wish was released on Warhead Records. In 2001 the album The Secret Kingdom was released on Well of Urd Records, a division of the now-defunct Hammerheart Records.

In 2007 it was announced that Judy had left the band late in the previous year. Despite this Simon is continuing on with Avrigus and a new album called "The Hidden Citadel" is in the works. It was announced in August 2009 that Avrigus' new vocalist would be Megan Robins, whose partner Lee Tassaker (bassist/vocalist for Lycanthia) would also be providing vocals on the new album.

The Final Wish and The Secret Kingdom can be downloaded from their official site via BitTorrent.

3rd Of May 2010, the band announced that they will be releasing an EP called "Beauty And Pain" as a precursor to the album "The Hidden Citadel". "Beauty And Pain" will consist of 5 tracks with a running time of approximately 30 minutes.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Avrigus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
