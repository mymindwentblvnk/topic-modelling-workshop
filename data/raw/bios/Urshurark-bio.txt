Urshurark is (or was) an Italian Black/Death Metal band started in May '99 in Bari, a town in the southern Italy. The band's purpose was to create a fusion between thrash, black and death metal, in a formula that mixes aggressive moments with an obscure and decadent basis.
 The debut album, "Architecture Of Perfect Damnation", represents this fusion between different styles and apocalyptic visions, the band moves in territories that draw from norwegian black metal and scandinavian death metal. Fused in an unique and letal formula that Urshurark define as "Horror Apocalyptic Metal", the sound of band destroy everything and doesn't take prisoners. The band was born for the will of Luca, singer and principal composer, than he will be helped by Claudio on keyboard.
