Te’Amir’s name means miracle in Amharic (the main Ethiopian language), and it seems like this Venice Beach native has been blessed with plenty of those. With musicians and artists for parents, he started taking photos at the age of six. As a drummer his prowess has led him to play everywhere the Del Rey Theatre to the Hollywood Bowl. His own beats are chopped up, stumbling, spacey affairs: drawing vibes from vintage soul to future hip hop, with melancholic synthesizers and bulk piano lines. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Te%27Amir">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
