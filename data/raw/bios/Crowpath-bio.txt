Extreme technical death metal/mathcore/grindcore band from Sweden.

Crowpath started back in 97 in a small town in the south of Sweden. Erik Hall-drums, Henrik Ivarsson-vocals and Patrik Lundh-guitars, has been permanent members since then. A few bassists have been in the band, but since 2001 Dan Bengtsson is playing the bass. Crowpath first release was a split 7" back in 99. After that crowpath did their s/t 7" on Scorched Earth Policy and then things started to roll for the band. They did a 5" released by Pillowscars in 2001 and all these releases was later to end up on a collection called "Old cuts and blunt knives" released by Robotic Empire in US. The first full length album "Red on chrome" was recorded in 2003 and last summer 2005 crowpath recorded their latest effort "son of sulphur" in their hometown of Malm√∂. Both full length albums has been released by Willowtip in the US and by Earache in Europe.
