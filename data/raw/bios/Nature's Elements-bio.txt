Nature's Elements is a Melodic Pagan Black Metal band from Israel.  Although founded in 2001 when Uzbekestan born vocalist Ipos decided to expand his solo project, they did not release an album until two years later.  Further releases were disrupted due to Ipos's decaying mental health, which led to his suicide in 2005. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nature%27s+Elements">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
