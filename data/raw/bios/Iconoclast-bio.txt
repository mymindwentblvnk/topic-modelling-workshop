There is more than one artist(s) with the name Iconoclast

1) A deathcore band from Perth, Western Australia, Iconoclast play energetic, technically proficient, politically charged deathcore with a fresh approach that stands out from the overused blastbeat/breakdown formula. While both of those elements are still present, Iconoclast strive to incorporate new concepts to their sound, taking influence from Groove Metal bands from the 90's to the recent 'djent' movement. Formed in 2012, they released their Debut EP "Autonomist" on 21 December 2012 + a music video for their single "Seditionist" in July 2013, both to critical acclaim. They are currently in pre-production for their eagerly awaited debut full length to be released in 2014.

2) Name of the second incarnation of the 70's Dutch punk rockers The Mollesters, in use since 2012. They have stated: We, Iconoclast, were not looking for an original band name as a matter of fact. We do not see us as a band , rather a Particle of something bigger than us. Iconoclast is exactly what we mean "No Rioting and looting but a Mental Evolution".
