Achillea is comprised of Danish artists Jens Gad (writer and co-producer of the group Enigma) and Helene Hørlyck.  Their album The Nine Worlds utilizes many of the same sounds and techniques that has made Enigma so popular, only this time around we are taken on a journey through the world of Nordic mythology and legend.

Achillea's second album, Amadas Estrellas, is comprised of the same Enigma-influcenced style, this time with vocalist Luisa Fernández.
