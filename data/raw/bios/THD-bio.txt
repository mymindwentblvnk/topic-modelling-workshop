Also known as  T.H.D, T.H.D., T·H·D, Total Harmonic Distortion 

Arising from the post industrial-mined landscape of North Eastern Pennsylvania, T.H.D. (Total Harmonic Distortion) was conceived in 1989 in its most basic form by S. Rudiman and E. Vargo. This cooperative effort started out of disgust with the collapsing American electronic scene and also allowed for the experimentation of translating human ideas to machine electronics. As with anything unfamiliar, T.H.D. learned the fundamentals and basics first. This led to the practice of using all resources to their maximum and fullest extent, which is still the core of T. H.D.’s methodology. Having some early recorded material, T.H.D. continued to evolve and met with A. Kane of G.P.C. Productions.

By meeting and learning from A. Kane, the project known as “Teknition” was formed. This led to the first publicly released material, “Teknition: Machine Religion” on Kane’s own G.P.C. label. Teknition became a cult favorite in the underground electronic scene and still generates some interest. That interest was also captured on the “Man Is The Animal” track of the “Cyberflesh Conspiracy” CD compilation released by If It Moves Records. Teknition also appeared on many cassette compilations in North America. Recording music as Teknition involved travel and not enough time to work on new material, so S. Rudiman and E. Vargo focused their efforts on a sound truer to their current beliefs and that was the birth of T.H.D.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/THD">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
