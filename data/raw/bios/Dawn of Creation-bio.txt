Dawn of Creation was formed in late 2011. in Vranje, Serbia, by Nikola Kostić (Deeper Down, Invaded) and Ivana Savić (Sakramentum, Kramp). The main goal was to create a modern sound based on groove and technical death metal, mostly inspired by Polish bands. After that, Dejan Pavlović (Invaded, Deeper Down) joined the band. Goran Živković (Sakramentum, Y.O.X) took the role of the bass player and backing vocals. After the first demo session, Ivana was fired, and Goran took over as the lead vocalist, and Predrag Simonović (Invaded, Deeper Down) became the new bass player. Band released first EP on June 6th 2014. entitled Masquerade Poetry.
