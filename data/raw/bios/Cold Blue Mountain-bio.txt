Cold Blue Mountain is a five-piece band from Chico, CA combining elements of doom, sludge, stoner metal, and post-rock to create a melodically driven, diabolically heavy sound. The band — which includes frontman Brandon Squyres, guitarist Will McGahan, guitarist Sesar Sanchez, bassist Adrian Hammons, and drummer Daniel Taylor — released their self-titled debut in 2012. In 2014, the band released their sophomore effort, “Old Blood” through Milwaukee’s Halo of Flies Records, following the release with a U.S. tour. Cold Blue Mountain is currently at work on the band’s third, as-yet-untitled full-length record. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cold+Blue+Mountain">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
