Fierce Band! was a Progressive Metal band from Denton, Texas. As of 2012 they are now known as Near Neptune

Formed in summer of 2010, the band initially formed as a progressive jam band influenced by acts such as Consider the Source, Emerson, Lake & Palmer and Scale The Summit composing songs up to twenty minutes in length. The band a year after formation began exploring vocals and thought that they would be a nice addition to the band's sound. The band is currently hibernating in the studio developing their self-proclaimed opus "Blue Liquid Lips" a song more than thirty minutes in length. The band has stated that once the track is complete they will begin recording their debut. 

The band currently has two releases out: Mom, The Bananas Were Green a single from the instrumental jam days and 2011 Demo a six track demo featuring the Blue Liquid Lips epic (which later in 2012 was re-recorded to make The Blue Liquid Lips EP). In 2012 the group began to write for their debut full length and released several demos of songs that would later be on the album. Towards mid-2012 the group parted ways with original drummer Nathan Place, upon his departure the band felt that the old moniker of Fierce Band! no longer suited the band's sound (the duo finding the name to be too silly) and changed their name to Near Neptune. 

In September of 2015, guitarist/vocalist Erin Vernon passed away of an overdose.
