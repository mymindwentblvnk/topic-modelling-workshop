There are multiple artists/bands with the name Toke.
1) Three dudes writting riffs. Stoner/doom from Wilmington, NC, US.

2) Rapper. Toke is native to Jersey, Hoboken and Jersey City to be exact. Barely an eighties baby, he is by far the most seasoned and talented artist yet to see a pay day. His greatest talent is the ability to re-invent himself for every song. 

A movement ten years in the making, he has plotted a commercial and underground push. It’s unfolding, with tons of work given away and scattered all over the tri-state, this battle tested emcee is about to bring serious problems to anyone in his way.

His desire for the fast life while trying to remain conscious, makes for new and innovative lyrics, while staying true to the art. Fast cars, nice clothes, beautiful girls, and a punch to back it all up, it’s no wonder why everyone figures the future is here. With enough hunger to take over the globe, prepare for the Toker - the front man and co-founder of two lables at once.

Remember this: he is the man who happens to rap, not someone rappin to be the man. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Toke">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
