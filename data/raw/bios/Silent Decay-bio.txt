Metalcore!? Screamo? Neo Thrash? New Metal? Göteborg Metal? Whatever... For Silent Decay it’s all simply Metal. The band doesn’t care for categories. Silent Decay know their Metal roots but are not stuck in the past. They constantly developed their sound without forgetting where they have come from. Bulky guitars, catchy leads, pushing rhythms and concise vocals above – that is the framework of their music. The audience is run over by the coarse power. But Silent Decay never forgets to put in melodies and hooklines to hold on to. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Silent+Decay">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
