Hardcore band from Oslo, or at least stationed in Oslo. They are 5 people, that really like playing together. They realy don't care what type of genre they play, but if you wonder you should check out their songs! April 18th, they went to Endless Tinnitus studio and recorded 5 songs, and hopefully they can hand out a demo soon if you want one, or simply just download it from their website: www.cruorisband.tk <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cruoris">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
