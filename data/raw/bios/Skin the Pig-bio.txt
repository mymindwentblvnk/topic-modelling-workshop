Hardcore / Metal / Progressive 
Band from,
Manchester, 
United Kingdom. 

Formed by Matt Geary in 2000, Skin the Pig are a progressive Metal band that have been playing these British Isles for nearly 10 years now.

Originally from N.Ireland the band relocated to Manchester England in 2004, where it has been based ever since.The band has been through a lot of changes due to one reason or another but has taken all the turmoil in its stride, assimilating all the influences that different members brought with them and evolving with it.
10 Years on, StP have carved a place for themselves by straddling numerous genres and trying to stay away from the theoretical musical norm by thinking outside the box.

'A song isnt finished until its finished, be it 3 minutes long or be it 10 minutes. Creativity should never be stifled by the wants of the masses but left to find its natural end'The above quote optimises Skin the Pig and because of their writing style. The music has been described as 'bleak but beautiful', with 'catchy heavy riffs coupled with powerful melodic and atmospheric breakdowns.An Epic musical rollercoaster ride that parallels their troubled past and hits the listener with something to think about rather than just mindless mosh.'

Love them or hate them, Skin the Pig, like their music, will carry on until they find their natural end and hopefully will be around for another good few years yet.
