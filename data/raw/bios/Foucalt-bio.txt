The band Foucalt was formed in autumn 2012 in Oslo, Norway.
In the autumn of 2014 the band released (self-released) album, Selling Death. It is a collection of early songs of the group, dominated with metalcore character. The new single titled Lost People (March 2016) shows that the musicians from Foucalt look for a new direction in their oeuvre, and are not afraid to go out beyond the frames set before.
Concerts of the group are performance like, where sounds, music, lights, and some forms of drama give a unique climate. Irony and humor, parody and caricature are the basic measures to show the grotesque, humor and absurdity of human existence.
Name Foucalt is a collection of certain meanings, inspired by the work of French thinker Michel Foucault.
