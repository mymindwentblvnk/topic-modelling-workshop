Scott & Charlene’s Wedding’s Craig Dermody is the voice of a generation, it just so happens to be a generation mired in dead end jobs while smiling into the sunshine as they wonder when someone is going to show up and call the cops on the party again.
Returning to Melbourne after a year of touring, with stints in New York and London and a quick trip around the world, Dermody’s writing reflects a new found weariness to wrap around his usual heart-on-sleeve lyrics and tales of everyday life. Never at a loss for a jangly riff or a humorous and poignant tale, Dermody doesn’t mature so much as he marvels at his inability to mature.

“Delivered”, from their latest EP of the same title, plays out as if Pavement had been bowing at the altar of The Velvet Underground instead of The Fall, all tied together with a Bowery rasp as if Richard Hell had grabbed the microphone. Picking up where the band left off with 2014’s “Back On The Tools” EP and their brilliant show-closing cover of The Go-Betweens “Karen”, the new material bursts forward with the usual ragged charm, propelled by an all-star band.

Now, Scott And Charlene’s Wedding continue with third album ‘Mid Thirties Single Scene’ out 2nd September 2016. Bursting with classic SACW tunes they’ll be hitting the road across Europe for the first time since 2014 later this year. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Scott+&+Charlene%27s+Wedding">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
