Triángulo de Amor Bizarro (Bizarre Love Triangle) is a band from A Coruña, Galicia. Their palette of sounds moves between the obsessiveness and hypnotism of shoegazer geometry, exactly as The Jesus and Mary Chain and My Bloody Valentine used to do. They are followers of No Wave and Kraut progression taken from the legacy of bands such as Stereolab.

They self-produced and released themselves their first two demos, coming second twice in a row in the Demo Project, organized by the Benicàssim International Festival (FIB).

After a series of gigs they then signed with the Madrid-based label Mushroom Pillow with a view to releasing their debut album in 2006.

Triángulo de Amor Bizarro fit under the aesthetic idealism of some beautiful work carved in black marble, achieving the purpose of getting you to look differently at a knife forever again. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Tri%C3%A1ngulo+de+amor+bizarro">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
