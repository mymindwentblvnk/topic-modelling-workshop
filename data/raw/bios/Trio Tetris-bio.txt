Trio Tetris was formed in 1999 in Tapanila, a suburb of Helsinki, Finland. 

Its members, Pelle Huuhtanen (keyboards), Joonas Kuittinen(bass & keyboards) and Toni Tarvainen (drums), have all played in various Finnish heavy metal bands and decided to try something new on the side. Starting off as just a side-project, Trio Tetris quickly became the main priority of all of its members. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Trio+Tetris">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
