Immersive. Bombastic. Epic.

Three words that put Unwritten Pages first release Noah in perspective; and a nutshell for that matter.

Noah tells the story of Phobos and Deimos, two citizens of Utopia City, a futuristic and impure city on Earth. It is the story of a dark and distant future and a grim look into the human being. It explains why scepticism can be fatal, and why a lack of it can bring one to his knees just the same. As Phobos and Deimos grow up on different sides of this divided and corrupted city, they eventually unite, with severe consequences. Facing the greatest conflict of all times, it is ultimately up to them to decide over thousands of lives and souls.

Pushing the idea of 100% creative control forward, German/Dutch composer Fred Epe has written 16 songs of unprecedented variety and gathered some of the best musicians around him to add their very own flavours to the music and to make Noah become an album true to the Unwritten Pages philosophy, which is all about new exciting ideas, excellent songwriting and pretty much anything that counters the word stagnation.
Be it metal, be it ambient, be it soundtrack music, be it classic or be it folk if it sounds intriguing, powerful and immersive, chances are you will find it as your progress through the world that is Noah.

The synergy of different musical approaches, a compelling and ambitious storyline and some of the most talented musicians and singers around welcome to the world that is Noah.
