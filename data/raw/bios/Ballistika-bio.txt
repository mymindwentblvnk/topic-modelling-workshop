Ballistika is a death metal band formed in Bloomington, Indiana. Ballistika takes their name from the medieval siege weapon of the same name, which matches their overall sound exactly: powerful, fast, and usually made out of wood. Ballistikaâ€™s sound could be described as a melodic charbroiled death metal band. Their songs are epic in nature with driving choruses, blistering guitar solos, and lyrically focus on themes of medieval battle and fantasy. Also features the 2009 Hoosier Guitar Idol, Parker Jameson Weidner, on lead guitars.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ballistika">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
