Duranta D. Cook (born December 31 1980 in Vallejo, California, USA), is an indie singer-songwriter that goes by his artist name Vital.

He was raised by his mother, Theresa McCall, a struggling parent who raised Vital and his sister Shalon by herself. He first performed at the age of six, singing and acting in a local church play entitled “The Return of The Messiah”. Less than a year later, when Vital was only seven, his mom was shot. Luckily she survived the tragic incident, however, the circumstances forced the three of them to move to Chicago to stay with relatives and friends. He moved back and forth between the two cities until he was twelve-years-old when he moved back to California to attend junior high school.

Prior to starting his solo career Vital wanted to be behind the music scene, writing and contributing by recording demos for other musicians in the Bay Area.

After being persuaded by the many people he met, he released two EP’s in the genre of Hip Hop and R&B.  “I never found my true self while doing what the society expected me to do, I never felt at home doing what’s expected”.

Wanting to experiment more with the music he felt was a better reflection of himself he went into the studio to record his first solo album in the summer of 2008. Now, over three years later he is anxiously waiting to let the world hear his music.
