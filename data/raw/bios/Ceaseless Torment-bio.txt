The fertilization of the band took place during a hangover day in 2007, when the feeling was at worse, and no man, could resist the circumstances. The next day, Antti and Seba realized that they’re having a band.

The adoption of Tuomo and Mikko took place the following year. The waiting ended in August 2008, when we settled down in “The Hotel of Love”.

In 2010, after eighteen months of satanic perversions, some fifteen minutes of audio format revenge was produced.

Next year went by in bewildering atmospheres of diarrhea. Preaching and touring in the nests of pure sin. Where bloody semen flowed out uninhibitedly from virginal sheep rectals. 
In addition, the band undivinely insulted the chosen people, whom turned into human wrecks after a New Decree of Reprobation.

In the summer of 2011 Tuomo was enlightened, and went on to preach to the peoples of the north, and debauch innocent minds, which led to a horny chase for a new handler of whips.
