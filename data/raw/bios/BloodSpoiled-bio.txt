In spring 2006 BloodSpoiled rose from ashes of Ambush The World, consisting of Ulrik on axe, Peder on bass, Lana on vocals and rythm axe and Hansi on drums. Under the guise of various names and members, the band on it's third year of existence, had had enough, and dissolved in winter 2005. After a short break it was obvious, that "Ambush" had been far too rock'n'roll, considering the ambitions of the majority of the band. Therefore Ulrik, Peder and Lana converged once again, with a modified line-up consisting of Lana on drums, Ulrik on axe and Peder on bass. Huge change, one might think.

The first couple of months went off rather slow paced, mostly because of Lana's immense apartment-movement spectacle, and because he went to Jutland at the same time, soldiering it off in the danish air force. But when he finally came out on top, band-practice was commenced, and things started to happen. Old material was reassembled and revised, and slowly the beast that was, and is, BloodSpoiled began to form.

In july 2006 they had a second guitarist auditioning. Bloodspoiled were to become a quintet, consisting of 2 axes, drums, bass and a vocalist that would be able to shred innards by the use of his voice alone. Unfortunately the audition turned out with no result, leading to another a couple of weeks later. This time the auditioner seemed promising, and the very same day, vocalist Mikael was summoned, resulting in a complete band! Or so they thought ... The new axe had to quit because of some personal issues.

With the minor handicap of lacking one guitarist, Bloodspoiled nevertheless got to practice, and did so to this very day as a quartet, and the result is some pretty cool and ripping songs, which should result in a demo cd at the beginning of 2007.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/BloodSpoiled">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
