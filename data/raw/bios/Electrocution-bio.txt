Electrocution was founded in Bologna, Emilia-Romagna, Italy, in 1990, Mick Montaguti vocals and guitar, and Alex Guadagnoli on guitar. In 1990 they released their 1st demo called No Rest in Peace followedtheir 2nd demo, The Real Doom, in 1991 and their 3rd and final demo Remains in 1992. After a few line-up changes, the core members, vocalist and guitarist Mick Montaguti, guitarist Alex Guadagnoli, Canali recruit Max on bass and his brother Luca Canali on drums enter the Westlink Studios, Pisa, Italy, to record their debut album Inside the Unreal, released by Rosemary's / Contempo Records in 1993. One of the best albums of Death Metal history, no doubt, rather technical, tempo changes are great, brutal riffs, guttural vocals and outputs a horror story, with the classical shrieks and groans, these Italians have no mercy, Influenced by the US Death Metal scene, the album is a ride to hell, an essential gem for any lover of Death Metal.
   After releasing their debut album, the band opened for Death, Carcass and Benediction, among others. A year later, in 1994, the band records an EP under the label Water Mirror Molten Metal Productions. That same year in August, the label released a split with the Swedish Hypocrite. Years pass and the lead singer and guitarist, Mick left the band to be replaced by Montaguti, Manuele Bruno and Gabriele Ravaglia. In 1997 they released their last EP, Acid But Suckable.Their latter releases are in the vein of Atheist and Cynic.
