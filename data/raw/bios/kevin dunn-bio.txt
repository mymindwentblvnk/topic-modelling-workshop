Multi-instrumentalist, songwriter, producer, and self-styled “guitar egghead” Kevin Dunn was one of the most distinctive and influential figures on the vital southern new wave scene. As a producer, he helped guide the early recorded efforts of Pylon and the B-52s, while as a performer (both under his own name and as a member of Atlanta's legendary Fans) he crafted (and continues to create, to this day) startling music that bristled with invention, melodic wit, and exploratory zeal – a uniquely southern refraction of the textural and lyrical possibilities of avant-garde pop.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kevin+Dunn">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
