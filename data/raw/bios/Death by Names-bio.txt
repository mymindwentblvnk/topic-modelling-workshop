Death By Names was a death metal band from Elizabeth, New Jersey. When it came to shredding and technicality, these guys knew their stuff. The band consisted of Mark Grillo on vocals/guitar, Kristian Lolo on bass, Gerardo Salazer on lead guitar, and John Paul Andrade on drums.

The band had planned on recording an EP and cancled their first full length due to "bad recording/mixing". Though this was all planned out Mark had decided to end the band, due to his relation with bassist Kristian Lolo. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Death+By+Names">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
