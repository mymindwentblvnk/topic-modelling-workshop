The Eyes of a Traitor released their impressive debut full-length in early 2009.  Having been discovered by UK underground label, Thirty Days of Night  when they were all just 16 years old, it was clear then that the future was bright for this Hertfordshire based quintet. The band recently signed to legendary metal label, Listenable Records in March 2008 (home to Gojira, Marionette, Textures and many more).

“A Clear Perception” showcases one of the hottest new bands to come out of the UK in a long time. Not wanting to follow the herd, The Eyes Of A Traitor like to take influence from a variety of bands and experiences meaning they are not your run–of-the-mill-generic-paint-by-numbers hardcore band. The albums heavy sound-scapes, melodic sensibilities and technical structure showcase a musical talent far beyond their years (the band are all under 21). A hard working attitude has helped them gain 5 independent tours covering UK and Europe, whilst building on their ever-growing fan base.  

The follow up to "A Clear Perception" named "Breathless" was released on the 12th July 2010, with track names including 'Come To My Senses' and 'Talk of The Town'

A new ep entitled "Disease" is available on their tour with Martyr Defiled, Heart in Hand and Carcer City. It is more a follow up to "Breathless" than to their debut album, as they continue to evolve, and improve on their newer sound.
