The members of The Narrator live in Chicago, but none of them are from there. Singer/guitarist Sam Axelrod is from uptown Manhattan. Bassist James Barron is from downriver Detroit and singer/guitarist Jesse Woghin is from all over, but mostly Long Island and Dallas. They’ve been around for a few years, driven around the country a bunch and made a few recordings, all of which are on Flameshovel, the label they love. Perhaps their greatest aspirations lie with continuing to do the things they do and have people come to their shows and enjoy them. It doesn’t seem like much, but really it is.

During the writing of their new album, All That to the Wall, The Narrator underwent some pretty heavy changes, which included the departure of their drummer. Maybe this slimming down further forced the boys in a direction they were already headed, or maybe it served to remind them of what they loved about being here in the first place.  Regardless, the band hunkered down in the studio and brought along friends – and mostly label mates – from the likes of Oxford Collapse, Russian Circles, Bound Stems, Sybris, Tight Phantomz and Lying In States to help make things right. Ultimately, the-new-look-Narrator has resurfaced as the delicious popcorn these kernels have always had inside of them, making a record that they’re truly proud of and really want you to hear.
