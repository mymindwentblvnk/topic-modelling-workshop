The first Death Metal band of MASS from Western, MA "1989-1995". Death Metal at that time was in the begining stages, and we were at the for front of the metal scene, and we took this area by storm. With bands like Obituary, Deicide, Napalm Death, and Carcass setting the main stream of Death Metal. With bands like Slayer, Anthrax, and Metallica who pushed a different kind of music in an era of Rock & Rap the move was in the right direction, at least for us. We were just 4 guys, from different backgrounds of music who got together with one thing in common (METAL).With a new sound and a different look on the music scene, we were putting together some of the heaviest music that poeple ever heard in this area.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/lachrymator">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
