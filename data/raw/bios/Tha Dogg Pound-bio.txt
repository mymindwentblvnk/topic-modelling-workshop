Tha Dogg Pound is a rap duo made up of Kurupt and Daz Dillinger. The group has spawned an extended family, made up of Kurupt, Daz, Warren G, Nate Dogg, RBX, Lady of Rage and Snoop Dogg (and, originally, Soopafly), Tray Deee, and Bad Azz called the Dogg Pound Gangsta Click or simply DPGC.

The group made their 1992 rap verse debut on Dr. Dre's The Chronic, on various songs. They also appeared on Snoop's classic Doggystyle, and the Death Row soundtracks Murder Was The Case and Above The Rim. Their solo, Dogg Food, was released in 1995. It was another addition to the controversy of rap music due to the sexual and violent lyrics and went on to sell three million albums.

In 1996, they were featured on 2Pac's Death Row Records debut All Eyez On Me. Kurupt and Daz went on to have solo success in 1998. They both eventually left Death Row Records, and Kurupt started Antra Records, while Daz started D.P.G. Recordz. In 2003 a feud arose between them because Kurupt had claimed that Daz betrayed him. Kurupt signed back to Death Row Records in 2004, and his awaited release "Against Tha Grain" has been postponed several times. Daz is still on D.P.G records, with his new 2005 release "Tha Dogg Pound Gangsta LP". Sometime in April 2005 at the West Coast Conference held by Snoop Dogg, Kurupt and Daz reconciled and recorded their new single "Push Back" that same night. There will be two new Dogg Pound albums out this year. The first will be a D.P.G.C. album with Tha Dogg Pound, Snoop Dogg, Nate Dogg, Soopafly, Warren G, Bad Azz, and Tray Dee.
