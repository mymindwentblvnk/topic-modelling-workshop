Constantinople is an ensemble specialising in music of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance.

Formed in 1998, and directed by Kiya Tabassian,  the ensemble juxtaposes a careful study of historical manuscripts with a pursuit of the living oral tradition of the Near and Middle East â€” more specifically, the classical Persian tradition.

Constantinople uses early European instruments such as the lute, vihuela, medieval harp, viola da gamba, vielle, recorder, cornetto, and shawm, alongside instruments from the Middle East such as the setar (a plucked stringed instrument from Persia), the tombak, daf, dayereh (Persian percussion instruments), and the oud (one of the most ancient instruments of the Middle East and the Mediterranean, and the ancestor of the European lute).
