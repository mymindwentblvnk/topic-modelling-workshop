London-based, Argentinian-born Malena Zavala exposed her raw emotions on her sublime 2018 debut album Aliso. On La Yarará, she finds a way to dig even deeper. With densely layered songs drawing on cumbia, reggaeton, Afrofunk, Argentine folk, and bolero-son, as well as British and American music, La Yarará signals a future of pop that’s thrilling, colorful and multicultural, and cements Zavala—who sings in both English and Spanish—as one of the genre’s most sophisticated practitioners. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Malena+Zavala">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
