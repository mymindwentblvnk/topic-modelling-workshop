Ancient Tale was formed in the middle of 1999 by Steve Gershon(Bass/Vocal) and Dave Sherman(Guitar). Since then they tried so hard to find their own style and sound. At the year of 2002, Dan Yoffe(Keyboards/Guitar) and Erez Levy(Drums) had joined the band in addition to add a great smell and sound of Progressive Metal. At June 2003 the band released their first Album Desire To Burn. The biggest problem of the band was their musical and lyrical style. Actually their music was influenced by the bands like Dream Theatre, Merciful Fate, Iron Maiden, Smashing Pumpkins and The Cure that maid their songs totally non-understandable for both Metal and non-Metal audience.  At the beginning of 2004 Steve Gershon left the band as a result of frustration over creative differences with the rest of the band.At same year he created Goth/Industrial Rock band Fatum Aeternam that was reincarnated later to Fatum Aeternum. He was replaced by Gray (Bass) and Dafna Paladin (Vocals). Both of them left the band year later. Two years later Erez Levy has started his own band Goshen  In May of 2008, there was rumors that band reformed with the original line up. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ancient+Tale">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
