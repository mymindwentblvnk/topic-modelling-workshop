Catscan started producing music a few years ago on his Amiga with Protracker. After sending a demo to ID&T, the A&R manager advised him to buy more professional equipment. One year later Catscan returned with a new demo and ID&T decided to release his first 12" on Thunderdome records. Through ID&T Bart got in contact with DJ Promo and they worked together on a few tracks. 

After ID&T stopped pressing hardcore records, Catscan joined Promo at the Third Movement. With The Third Movement, Catscan had his own label called: Catscan Limited. On this label he releases tracks that are totally in his own unique style.

After some time at the Third Movement, in 2006, Catscan decided to reak away from The Third Movement and set up his own label 'Pro Artist Management' which he set up with DJ X-Ess. Catscan LTD is a sublabel of Pro Artist Management and is managed by Catscan himself. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Catscan">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
