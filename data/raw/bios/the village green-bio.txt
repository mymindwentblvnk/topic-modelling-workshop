In the few short years that the band has been in existence, they've kicked up frenzy. Named after the Kinks' classic The Village Green Preservation Society, this rock outfit, duly inspired by the aforementioned, but then perhaps every other groovy thing to have come out of Great Britain between '66 and '73, has tuned out and tuned, er turned off and oh, bloody hell, turned on most of their Pacific Northwest with stellar shows, packed to gills, tons of good press saying much of what we're trying saying here (but, better) and some fabulous radio play. What more do you need?

The centerpiece of all this hubbub is a fellow named J. Nicholas Allard. His job, as well as the mandate of his cohorts, is to rock. And, God knows, The Village Green's much-loved, self-titled, self-released EP (2005) proved it all night, having showcased 6 tracks of diverse rock rave ups, sufficiently running the gamut of Brit-tinged guitar oeuvre.

The Village Green's new album "Feeling The Fall" is self produced and recorded and features 11 shiny new rockers giving us the good stuff without the benefit of pouts, haircuts or stupid shoes. The vibe, evident in tunes like "When The Creepers Creep In" display a unique sophistication in songwriting and performance, harnessing sincerity, but not without attitude and the rare gift of nodding to, without ripping off. Check out "Chomping At The Bit" as proof in the pudding, or listen to "Wrap Your Love Around Me" and you'll be hooked. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Village+Green">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
