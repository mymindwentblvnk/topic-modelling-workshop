Zap Mama was founded by Marie Daulne &  since the release of "7" (2002), the project has evolved into a seven person band, with two backup singers, keyboards, bass, drums & percussion / decks. Additional current members include Nia Saw 

As well as her Congolese roots, Daulne's cross-genre style may result from her varied past: Her father, a  Belgian, was killed during the revolution  while her mother was pregnant with her. The remainder of the family fled to the forests and found refuge with a tribe of pygmies. Daulne was raised primarily in Europe, but when she heard a recording of traditional pygmy music at age 20, she decided to return to Africa to learn about her heritage. She was trained in pygmy onomatopoeic vocal techniques before returning to Europe to found Zap Mama. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Zap+Mama">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
