Asaf Avidan & the Mojos was an Israeli band formed in 2006. After disbanding in 2011, a 2012 remix of the band's single "Reckoning Song" (2008) by German disc jockey Wankelmut attained widespread commercial success throughout Europe. Asaf Avidan has subsequently embarked on a solo career.

The group's original name was Asaf Avidan & the Mojo Jive Cats, but it was soon after shortened to Asaf Avidan & the Mojos. Throughout 2006 and 2008, the band rose to major fame in Israel, receiving recording proposals from multiple local labels. However, the group released their debut studio album The Reckoning independently in March 2008.

Poor Boy / Lucky Man, the band's second album, was released in Israel in September 2009 to favorable reviews. 

The band premiered their third and last record Through the Gale in November 2010.

Asaf Avidan soon after announced that the group would disband because of his desire to pursue a solo career.

Asaf Avidan & the Mojos sounded like a blend of everything that is liked about rock in the 60's and 70's, with a edge of modern sound and a dash of... that thing that happens along only once in a generation: a true unique voice. Captivating audiences of all ages, the lyrics and music struck a global chord. From acoustic, armor piercing duets with Hadas Kleinman on the cello, to the body shaking, all-band rock tunes.

Asaf & the Mojos played some of the best Venues around, got great radio air time and interviews, and some T.V exposure. In October 2007 The band had a small tour to New-York city, they took part in the M.E.A.N.Y Festival at the "Knitting factory" N.Y ,won the "NOTABLE MENTION" title and were invited to come back in December for another show. "This was one of those concerts where you come out drenched to the pit of your soul, full of energy and dead tiered at the same time – I can't remember a time when I was so awe-stricken by a performance!"
