There is more than one artist under this name:

1.) Slutet formed in Uppsala, Sweden in 2013. Not much information is known about them, other than that they are a component of a collective dubbed as The End Commune. In their words, "We sound like molotov cocktails. Your cliff's edge is nearing, and we stand on the other side of the gorge, playing our music. Take your eyes off of your little black screen for one second and look around you; you will find us, and we are sure you'll dislike it. Then we succeed, and celebrate".

2.) Slutet formed in mid-2009 and have their roots in Gothenburg, Sweden and have made themselves a name on the alternative rockscene with their unique combination of dreamlike sound landscapes and funeral moods which sometimes aches as much in the ears as in the heart.

3.) Slutet [Sluh-Tet] was formed in Singapore in Late 2007 by current & former members of Blinded Humanity, Hudud, Pazahora & Stronza

Playing noisy crust punk music to bleed your ears!!!
