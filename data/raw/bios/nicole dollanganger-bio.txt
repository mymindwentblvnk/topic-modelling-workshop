Nicole Dollanganger is a singer-songwriter from Stouffville, an eerily silent suburb of Toronto. She has been releasing her music without any label support via https://nicoledollanganger.bandcamp.com since 2012 before she was signed in 2015 by Eerie Organization, the collective/artist incubator run by Claire Boucher aka Grimes. Her music is characterized by her innocent-sounding voice accompanied by a spare instrumentation that stands in stark contrast to dark, sometimes macabre lyrics. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nicole+Dollanganger">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
