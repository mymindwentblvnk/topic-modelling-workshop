Helvis: Ex-members of Iron Monkey using an anal intruder on the still-twitching corpse of Black Sabbath... the gnarliest thing you'll hear this side of Raging Speedhorn doing a tribute to Disorder! - Ian Glasper - Terrorizer

Helvis were a UK band that existed from 1998 - 2002 they did one album "Reverend The Sacrifice" and one EP "Genocider" and featured future and ex members of Black Eye Riot, Urko, Iron Monkey, Geriatric Unit, Hard To Swallow, Acrimony, Sigirya. This is some seriously fucking chunky rocking hardcore metal these guys would've fitted easily on the bill with the likes of Iron Monkey, Raging Speedhorn or Charger Featuring Rat from The Varukers on Helvis cover of their "Nothings Changed" you know this is a metal band with their roots in crust and hardcore. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Helvis">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
