Cellars is an 80s-influnced, synth/pop project founded in 2013 by Allene Norton. Growing up, Allene was always attracted to anything musical and she began playing piano and guitar at the ages of 8 and 12. After a high school phase of writing songs on acoustic guitar and performing in coffee shops, she attended school for audio engineering. After taking classes in synthesis and remixing, she began experimenting with home recording of synth-based pop music which eventually grew into the songs of Cellars. Not only does Allene write and arrange the songs, she is a multi-instrumentalist, vocalist, and engineers and mixes her recordings. Cellars was founded after a move to Los Angeles in 2013 in order to bring her home recordings to the stage with ex-guitarist Riley Walker. Since then, Cellars' live set has taken on many iterations ranging from solo sets to a full backing band.  Influenced heavily by the music of the late 1970s and 1980s, Cellars' music harkens to the age of early digital experimentation with a modern twist. Madonna, Prince, Human League, Depeche Mode, Yaz, Debbie Deb (among other 80s latin freestyle) New Order, and YMO are all early influences.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cellars">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
