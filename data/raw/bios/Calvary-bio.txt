1) Calvary was a band from Chicago, IL. Formed by Matt Weeks (Current, Ottawa, .NEMA) joined by his friends Dave Song and Jeff Rice (Ottawa, .NEMA) after the demise of their previous band Dearborn S.S. in late summer of 2000, Calvary grew to be one of the most recognized bands on Weeks's own council records' roster. Matt Ryan (ex-Human Cock) joined the band on second guitar. 

Calvary recorded a demo with that setup and released it on april, 20th of 2001. The remainder of the year was spent playing local venues and writing material for an upcoming full-length. Their debut LP 'Outnumbered Is Outflanked' was recorded on february, 2nd 2002 and released later that year. To promote their long-play the band embarked on a short summer tour of the west coast with The Shivering and Yaphet Kotto.

After a brief tour of the east coast in spring of 2003 Jeff Rice left the band. Ebro Virumbrales (of Los Crudos and MK Ultra) took his place behind the drum set. The band recorded and released a 3-song EP entitled 'The Will of the Way' in late spring only to disband shortly after to little fanfare.

It's hard to define their sound, and it is even harder to attach them to a certain genre. Calvary combines the passion of Current with a punk rock sound ala Wire; the end result is a sort of late '70s punk woven together with the sort of vocal passion that came out of the early '90s emo scene.
