Uburen was formed in 2010 and after a long struggle to find the right line-up and sound they ended up with a mutual ideology of resurfacing the Viking folklore. From there they then started to play their music with the mindsetting of Vikings in the midst of the battlefield.

Fast, hard and merciless; working as a unit with 3 vocals, brutal guitars, Viking horns and all the elements to capture a true feel for the Norwegian scene. Prepare for the war cry with sword in hand.

In 2011 they won the Norwegian Metal 2 the Masses and played the newblood stage at Bloodstock Open Air and had great feedback from both press and audience. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Uburen">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
