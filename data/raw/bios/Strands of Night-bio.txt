-Strands Of Night- is a epic melodic death metal band started and formed by bassist and main composer Rene Vela in January 2009 ever since he started messing around with a guitar and distortion. Rene V writes all music, bass/guitars/keys/ and right now uses a drum program to get the beat behind it all until Strands Of Night finds a permanent drummer for the band. The music itself has a dark/evil feel to it, but still caries the melodic death metal sound that makes Strands Of Nights sound.

Early 2010 3 or more songs will be up on this, and Strands Of Night's official myspace www.myspace.com/strandsofnightmusic to give everyone a better idea/feel of what Strands Of Night has in store for the metal world. Rene Vela had originally planned Strands Of Night to be a solo project, but with so many great responses and fans of the 1 of the many songs "Damnation", the final decision has been made to make Strands Of Night a live touring metal act!

So If you like what you hear so far, and want to help out the band... please spread the word about Strands Of Night to everyone and anyone else you think would like the music. New songs with vocals/New Layout/Pictures of the band/and all the info you will ever need or would want to know about Strands Of Night coming real soon.
