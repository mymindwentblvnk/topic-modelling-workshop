They originally practiced in a meatlocker that was numbered seven and that's how they got their band name. They were a thrash metal outfit from Victoria, British Columbia, Canada.  They formed in 1995 and disbanded in 2006.  They only released three EP's, one demo, one video and one full-length album.  They had misanthropic lyrics.  Their last lineup consisted of Bram Harvey on vocals, Mike Selman on guitar, Darryl Curren on guitars, Steve Migliarese on bass and Lincoln McCulloch on drums.  Galy Records was the last label they were signed to. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Meatlocker+Seven">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
