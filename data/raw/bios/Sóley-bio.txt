Sóley (Sóley Stefánsdóttir) is an Icelandic singer/pianist based in Reykjavík, Iceland. She studied composition, is a passionate piano player and started her musical career in 2006 by joining the Icelandic indie-collective Seabear. 
In March 2010 she released her debut EP Theater Island which was followed by her first full-length We Sink, released on September 2, 2011 - a pop record, that sounds like a dream: sweet and weird at the same time. Critical response was largely positive, with praise often aimed at the "delightful and beautiful" piano play and the delicate vocal delivery. The songwriting was also celebrated for its "dream-like" quality and "dark surrealism". Sóley herself described her lyrics as "Dreamy, surrealistic and in their own world", expressing her hope that listeners will decipher their own meaning from the words.
A piano album composed and performed entirely by Sóley, entitled Krómantík (Chrome Antiques), was released on 18 July,2014. Work is already underway on a second LP as well, which is to be released sometime in 2015. And Sóley hopes to tour the world after some planned appearances in Iceland Media and a music festival. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/S%C3%B3ley">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
