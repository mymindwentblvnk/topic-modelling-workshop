Elegant Rose is a rock/metal band from Italy. They stand out for their very "heavy" arrangements contrasting with a very melodious, almost classical female singing voice.

They have recently released their first album called "King and Queen". It is a concept album, a compilation of songs that tell a story. The underlying themes are drawn from epic and fantasy; the two main characters are a warrior queen (Yras) and a dragon abandoned to its sad fate (Alexander).

The main influences of the Elegant Rose, in terms of voice and melody, are modern bands such as Nightwish, Epica, Within Temptation and Evanescence, while the arrangements bear the influence of the German band Helloween (Epic Metal).
