Grooving and shredding death metal from The Netherlands!

From the foundations of several Dutch metal acts like Houwitser, Supreme Pain, Sinister and Deadcell, Bleeding Gods was born in late 2012.

After he had left Houwitser in 2012, Ramon started to write an album on guitar and drumcomputer at home. Just (basic)demo songs that were groovy, fast and also slow, but most of al: heavy! When the pre-production demo was done, the time was right to look for people to join in and some fellow metal-musicians, contacts from the past years on several festivals, club shows and tours were asked. The former bands of all the guys were (technical) death metal bands, so the challenge to do something different this time was attractive.

Bleeding Gods plays groovy, riffing and shredding metal with some thrash and death influences in it.

After a couple of rehearsals in the beginning of 2013, Bleeding Gods recorded early April their 4-track promo. The lyrical theme is about Ancient Gods, wars and history like the Mayans, Ancient Egyptian and Greek Gods.
With this 4-track promo entitled ‘Blood Symphony’, Bleeding Gods likes to promote and introduce themselves worldwide to press, labels and audience. With the pre-production demo Bleeding Gods got worldwide endorsement deals with ENGL Amps and Serpent King Guitars (SKG).

In 2014 Bleeding Gods got signed by the Italian recordlabel Punishment 18 Records.
