BRANDHAARD was inflamed in 2004 by GRAFTAK and VOS. As a 2 man formation we recorded the m-cd "Heidens Nederland". After that we did a number of gigs as a duo (Guitar/Sreams and Drums). We recorded a couple of those gigs and made a DVD from a numbeer of songs. In the spring off 2006 ANTI-KRISS joins the band on the Bass guitar, this adds the third dimension to the band. In the autumn off 2006 we recorded a new CD called "Roest op de Heidenziel". This CD was sold during concerts and limited to 100 pieces and sold out. 

In 2007 we worked hard to complete the new DVD, which is out now and is titled "3 Jaar Razernij". The new CD is also out now and entitled "Live in Midgard", recorded live in XiniX nieuwendijk. The new DVD and CD can be obtained at a gig or through this website. This autumn and winter we will be working on new material so keep an eye on our website!!!!!
