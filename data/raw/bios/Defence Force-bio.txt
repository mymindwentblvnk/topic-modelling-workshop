Formed in 2005 by Shaun McCarroll and Adam Squire with Dan Jones joining a bit later. The name was though up by Adam who being a massive Wrexham fan named the band after the club in Trinidad where Wrexham signed Dennis Lawrence. 

Worlds End Demo recorded very cheaply (so cheaply it in fact cost nothing) at the arse end of 2005, this probobly reflects in the sound quality and general shittiness altogether of it. Eventually I will re-record some of the tracks off it.

Dan was sacked/left (depending on who you ask) at the end of 2005. This signalled the end of the band due to varying consequences. 

Mid 2006 Adam develops tendonitis in left wrist prohibiting guitar playing for 9 months. 

Early 2007 Adam decides to resurrect Defence Force name as a one man project as ''it gives me the freedom to create what I want and not have to worry about other people liking it or being able to play it. I could of chose a different name but basically I though of the name and wrote most of the stuff so bollocks to it.'' 

Now writing a recording again 2 Demo's are in the pipeline, Misanthropists Crusade which will be new stuff and Scrap Metal which is a rerecording of the Worlds End demo.
