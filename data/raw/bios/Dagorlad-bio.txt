1) Dagorlad was formed in June 1997. It is a two-men Atmospheric Medieval Metal project with all compositions recorded and produced in the band own studio. All music is created and played by Philippe Gandibleu.

The first album “Incantations” was released in February 1999 by Two Moons records and consisted of ten songs including a storm of raw guitars embellished with atmospheric or classical layers of synthesizer. The inspiration for the lyrics and the atmospheres were found in horror movies from the thirties and for the second half of the CD in heroic fantasy novels. After this first opus, Patrick Devits (vocals) left the band and was replaced by AOD.

The second album “The End of the Dark Ages” was released in 2002 by the LSP Company. It is a musically more complex album including a heroic fantasy story written by AOD.

“Herald of Doom” is the brand new album released by Shiver records. This is another fantasy concept album, with more melodic songs and an improved great modern sound. The mastering was done by Zareh Abrahamian, a good friend of the band whereas the beautiful cover, as for “The End…”, was created by Kris Verwimp.

In the meantime, Dagorlad is already working on a new album, the story continues...
