Deadly Remains is an up and coming death metal band from Northern California that came into existence in the fall of 2006. The band produced and released an eight track demo called Moral Crusade in 2008. Recorded at NB Recording Studios in Santa Rosa, CA Moral Crusade afforded the band opportunities to play throughout California and build a fan base. From that point the style of the band and individual musicianship has continued to progress; adding more dissonance, technicality and lower tuning. Deadly Remains strives to create music that has intensity and substance, blending brutal/technical death metal with progressive/melodic sections. In fall of 2009 Deadly Remains released Before the Nothing (once again recorded/mixed/mastered at NB Recording Studios), featuring artwork by Jon Zig as well as improved songwriting, musicianship, and better production. The band toured the Pacific Northwest (CA, OR, WA, ID, UT, LV) on this release. Over the past two years Deadly Remains has played shows in theater halls, clubs, bars, warehouses, homes, back yards, and everything in between. They have made numerous appearances at festival type shows all over California and Nevada, and have had the privilege of sharing the stage with notable bands such as Napalm Death, Flesh Consumed, Sepsism, Colonize the Rotting, Septycal Gorge, Cerebral Incubation, Condemned, Embryonic Devourment, Putrid Pile, Arkaik, Pathology, Inherit Disease, To Violently Vomit (disgorge), and Vulvectomy. Deadly Remains has finished recording new material for a Fall 2011 release via Deep Send Records entitled “Severing Humanity”. Expect technicality, dissonance, and brutality in the vein of Defeated Sanity, Gorguts, Disgorge, Suffocation.
