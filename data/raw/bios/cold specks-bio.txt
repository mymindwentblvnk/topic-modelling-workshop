Cold Specks is Canadian musician Al Spx from Etobicoke, Canada, who now lives in London. Cold Specks' music is steeped in the musical traditions of the Deep South. No wonder then that Al cites the Lomax Field Recordings and James Carr as influences along with Bill Callahan and Tom Waits. With a voice that evokes the 'spirit feel' of Mahalia Jackson and the visceral tones of Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Cold Specks' sparse arrangements and chain-gang rhythms stop you dead in your tracks. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cold+Specks">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
