Lucyfire is “Edlund's Alter Ego” . 

Johan Edlund is the frontman of the Swedish goth metal band Tiamat.
The big difference between Tiamat and Lucyfire is that Lucyfire is more straightforward rock with the lyrics more of the sex, drugs and rock'n'roll type, compared to the heavy philosophic lyrics of Tiamat.
