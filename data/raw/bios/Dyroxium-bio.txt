Dyroxium was formed back in 2005 after the disbanding of the group's former band Flatline (2002). The three piece from Michigan put out their first demo, released by The Blue Grotto in 2006. Two years later in 2008, they put out their first full length album, Irrational Landscapes. The band combines elements from many different genres, including Death Metal, Black Metal, Psychedelic Metal, and Experimental Rock. They classify themselves as Psychedelic Experimental Death Metal.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dyroxium">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
