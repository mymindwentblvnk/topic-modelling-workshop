Santeria applies to at least 2 variant bands:

1. Santeria is a rock band from Lafayette, Louisiana.
They write soulful, blues-laden songs that are going to haunt you forevermore.
Born in the haunted backwoods of Louisiana where atmosphere plays as much a part of the music as the rich cultural legacy of the South. This isn’t alternative, metal, or emo. This is Santeria, a kick out the jams, southern-inflected rock & roll band. Their cultural isolation from the rest of the world has birthed something starkly original, yet catchy—a mix of hard rock, psychedelia, world music, & ghost town blues.

2. Santeria was a goth/death rock band from Montreal, Quebec in the early to mid part of the 90s. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Santeria">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
