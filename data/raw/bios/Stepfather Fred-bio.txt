Powerful guitar gripes, catchy vocal parts with groovy drums and expressive bass harmonies – this is what STEPFATHER FRED stands for!
With their heavy alternative rock, the young musicians from southern Germany provide an absolutely convincing mixture of “Old School vs. New School”.
Apart from many exhausting performances in clubs, halls as well as at festivals, the guy’s managed it to add some real big deals to their reference list. In 2010 for example, STEPFATHER FRED had a guest act on the world famous SOUTHSIDE FESTIVAL performing with bands like the BEATSTEAKS, BILLY TALENT or THE STROKES on their line up.
In spring 2012, STEPFATHER FRED goes on Germany tour with two international top acts – the famous EMIL BULLS from Munich and HÄMATOM. Together with the bands they will travel around Germany playing in the most popular clubs of the country. So far, the young musicians have also successfully supported bands like PRO PAIN, EXILIA or many others.
Another highlight in spring 2012 will be the publishing of the band’s second album
Raise Our Flag’ (4 April 2012). According to the guys, their second album which they recorded together with the producer Ralph Quick (H-Blockx, Die Happy) at the Rock City Studios in Solingen would definitively exceed the old one. Old songs were improved by a better and more functional song material showing their fans now a terrific new creation. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Stepfather+Fred">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
