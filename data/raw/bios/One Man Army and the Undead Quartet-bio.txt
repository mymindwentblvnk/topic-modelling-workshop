This lengthily-named band from Sweden features vocalist Johan Lindstrand (ex-The Crown) who formed this new band after The Crown disbanded in 2004. The Crown later reformed in December 2009 with Jonas St√•lhammar of God Macabre as the new vocalist.)

The debut album, 21st Century Killing Machine, while musically similar to The Crown, easily stands on its own merits and confirms the birth of a promising metal band. Rather, this is crunchy, modern thrash, relentless and intense, with a spot-on production and venomous, convincing vocals from Lindstrand.

Lineup as of 2011:
Johan Lindstrand - vocals
Pekka Kiviaho - rhythm guitar
Jonas Blom - lead guitar
Robert Axelsson - bass
Marek Dobrowolski - drums <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/One+Man+Army+and+the+Undead+Quartet">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
