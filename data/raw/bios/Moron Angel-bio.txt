Journey of the 4 Southern Thrashers First,known as Kaze-o, united in waterfall music studio,we were satria(voc),Ryand(gtr),Azee(bas),and Adit(dru).Our music was J-Rock,J-metal.But we're bored and got no progress.and one day we got a new rebellion spirit.The faster,heavier,harder beats called Thrash Metal. No longer after that,,Adit was tired of being a drummer of this band. he decided to left this band because of many conflicts between us.Once again,we felt hopeless. But we couldn't end this band easily.We woke up and reborn as a new band named MORON ANGEL. A thrash revival project. Our lyrics are around the social + political error in our country. We fight against capitalism and support the human rights, justice, environment and the global crisis... To fill an emptiness in drums beats we recruited a new band member,Alwin. But he had a lot of business and he has left the band...Luckily,,,,we've already found a new drummer, The Unstoppable Okky ! We're ready to kick your ass with our Thrash! We already have 7 songs in upcoming 1st mini album.They are:Thrash Not Dead, Kenyataan Suram, Boycott Your Destiny, Shoot the Bastard, Dying Teddy, Global Wafer, and War Or Die. Let us introduce our new bad ass buddy, and the dude is Pedro the Moron !!!  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Moron+Angel">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
