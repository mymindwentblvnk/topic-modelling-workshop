Cakewet was created back in 2002 by former drummer Sergio (Gerbophilia, Enoid, Krigar) and Sam (ex-Borborygm; ex-Yog, Zeppo). The band's clearly influenced by such bands as Last Days Of Humanity, Dead Infection or Cock And Ball Torture, is joined soon by Aurélie for the vocal duties and by Sarah (Basse). The band plays some concerts and participates at a split cd with Gerbophilia, Mesrine, Teddy Beer, Chats-thons and Happy hippos Massaker. At the same time, the band gives out their first demo "Too avek un pied" (2003). At that time, the Gore part of Cakewet's music is more important and the band part ways with their singer and guitar player. In search of a new singer, Emilia (Gerbophilia) gives the band a hand for some concerts. The band is joined in 2004 by Lionel (Ex-Ipsum, Ashen Dawns) to hold on the basse duties and  Olivia for massive killing vocal skills. The band decides to record a new demo called "Poser Division Cakewet" and continues its way until 2006 and the addition of a new guitar player to the line-up Sara. The same year the band had to deal with the loss of two long time members,oriiginal drummer Sergio, quikely replaced by Antoine (Dark Rise, Antharès) and bassist Lionel replaced by Pascal. 
Since their debut in 2002, the band has played with many bands such as Rompeprop, Mumakil, Pigsty, Blockheads, Rot, etc.
