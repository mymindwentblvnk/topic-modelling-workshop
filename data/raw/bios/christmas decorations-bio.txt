Christmas Decorationsâ€™ recordings tread a fine line between organic and electronic, experimental and rock music. The tracks on the Blueprints compilation move away from the structured songs of their debut Model 91 (kranky, 2002), with a more open-ended exploration of order and time. Their 2006 album Communal Rust (community library) explores ideas somewhere between the two. 2008's Far Flung Hum LP (available on vinyl or as an online download) adds third member Peter Kerlin. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Christmas+Decorations">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
