There are 3 bands known as Second sun.

1) A dutch dance/house duo. Second Sun conquered the trance world with their hit collaboration with Paul Van Dyk, "Crush" (3 singles on his label - "Empire", "The Spell" and "Playground" helped solidify their rep, with spins from the worlds top DJs and spots on countless compilations). Then, they hit the house scene in a major way: one the biggest tracks of Miami's WMC 2006 with their remix of Queens Another one Bites the Dust (soon to be released on top dance label Positiva/EMI Records), plus vocals & remixes for Deep Dish's Party all the time & Sander Kleinenberg. Spins from the biggest house DJs, including regular plays on Pete Tong's "Essential Selection" on BBC Radio 1, helped audiences worldwide realize how versatile these Miami-based boys really are. Now, they have affected the dance scene in a new way: with their mind-blowing live show! Unprecedented stage presence, live keyboards an especially Antoine's live vocals have made Second Sun America's hottest live dance act, bringing an almost rock-show-like feel to packed clubs and festivals. No wonder URB magazine has dubbed the duo clubland's newest superstars.
