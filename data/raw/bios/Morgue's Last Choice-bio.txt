MLC was born in 2002 when Lunastaja experimented with the ugliest, slowest industrial-noise-ambient that face of the earth could stand. In 2004 JkPoig and Põrguisand joined. With their help MLC's first full-length album "Vulgaria Necrofilia" and EP "HallmaSSSeenkasvaja" were recorded.

In 2006 Suva joined the band and the previosly Dark Industrial project became to be more metal-centric. Strong influences from Doom and Black metal crawled in. With this sound two gigs were held in Tallinn and early 2007 album "Killer Fungus" presentation party took part in Tartu. 

Soon after that band activity was frozen but in late 2009 established compilation-album "Seedetrakti Päev" which includes previously unreleased materials.

2011 became a third rise of MLC, when band made three performances in case of Servataguse Muusika event series and late 2011 will be available Split-EP "Sessioonsed Seminoomid" with experimental black metal band Edasi. The sound of new material is more like early albums.
