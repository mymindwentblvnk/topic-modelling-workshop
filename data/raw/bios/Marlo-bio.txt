There are multiple artists on Last.fm with the name 'Marlo'.  

The first is an Electronic/Trance/Progressive Australian DJ MaRLo 
Record labels: Spinnin, Armada, Flashover, Blackhole

Dutch born DJ and producer MaRLo who now calls Australia home, is a exciting and creative Producer/DJ.
The MaRLo sound is a signature blend of hands in the air moments with tech infused beats, encompassing influences of Trance, Techno, Tech-House and a mish mash of various other chunky sounds. MaRLo is not one to be pigeon holed, and his DJ sets can only be described as the "MaRLo sound".

MaRLo's studio trickery has seen him sign productions to trance super-labels such as Armada, Spinnin Records, Blackhole recordings, Flashover and many more.
Most impressively, his remix of Ferry Corsten- Brainbox is a dance floor destroyer and has been played by Ferry Corsten in every set since its release.
MaRLo's productions are always diverse, with no track sounding like the last, MaRLo has been able to gain a large and loyal fan base who are always ready to be surprised by his latest release. This diversity was recognised by world famous "Cirque du Soleil" when they asked him to produce and perform his own interpretation of their music at the massive Uitmarkt festival in Amsterdam. MaRLo's productions receive highly coveted respect and recognition, featuring on popular TV shows, reaching high rotation on FM radio stations and scoring Tune of the Month in "Mixmag", "DJ Mag" and "Tillate" for his track "MaRLo feat Kristen Marlo - Is it Real".

MaRLo tracks frequent the Beatport charts and are played by Armin van Buuren, Tiesto, Markus Schulz, Sander van Doorn, Ferry Corsten and many more.

As a DJ, MaRLo's sets echo the diversity of his releases and are heavily filled with his own productions. In 2010 he was voted Australia's #2 Trance DJ and asked to mix the Ministry of Sound Trance Nation vol 2 CD, which included a 14 date tour of sold out events. He has had the honour of playing to thousands of people from across the world at events such as Sensation, Trance Energy (Holland and Australia). Creamfields, Gatecrasher, Slinky, Godskitchen and many more.

Not your typical trance producer, MaRLo brings something fresh to the world of electronic music. With his achievements to date, a solid list of upcoming releases, collaborations, international gigs and a radio show in the works, it looks like there are no signs of things slowing down for the energetic MaRLo.
