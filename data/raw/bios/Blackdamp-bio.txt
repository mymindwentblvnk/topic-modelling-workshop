Blackdamp is a 4-Member metal act, from the city of Beckley, WV. Their sound is different than anything that is popular in the industry today. It can be best described as a diverse mixture of new-school styles mixed with old-school styles, in the tradition of melodic and technical guitar riffing, accompanied by drive pounding drum beats and solid pulsating low end bass, the vocals fall somewhere between high and low pitched brutal anger, and don't forget the irresistible urge to thrash your head around to the bone breaking grooves that get thrown at you in just the right places. Their song writing style brings back true emotion and keeps your attention to admire the way that their style can fuse music that is both listener friendly and can still make you wanna destroy everything in sight...
