FaceGrinder is a grindcore band from Mandurah, Western Australia. Formed in the winter of 2011. Originally considered a side project of Guitarist, Ewza Lambert (CorpseFlesh) and Vocalist Mike Burke (Raptor Jesus), until things got serious when Drummer, Dayle Edmondson (Befallen), joined forces with Ewza and Mike to form a swarming 3 piece grind machine.

In late 2012, Jason Collis (The Black Mullets), joined FaceGrinder as Bassist to complete the band as a 4 piece, while unfortunately Mike Burke had to leave the band due to other commitments. Paul Wachla (Genocidal / Chainsaw Abortion/CorpseFlesh) had filled in for a couple shows then eventually became permanent vocalist as of January 2013. 

An EP entitled 'Dreamspace' was released for free download early 2012 through Torn Flesh Records, aswell as a split EP (with CorpseFlesh) available through Infinite Regress Records and Ungrateful Dead Promotions.

The band's lyrics are mostly concerned with unstable mentality & theoretical convulsion and the music is paying homage to such bands as Napalm Death, Pig Destroyer, Gadget, Insect Warfare. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Facegrinder">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
