Laika is a band founded in 1993 and ike their namesake -- the dog rocketed into orbit by the Soviets renowned as the first living creature to exit the earth's atmosphere -- Laika traveled the spaceways, forging a distinct and wildly experimental fusion of hip-hop, jazz, electronica, dub, and Krautrock without earthly precedent. Somewhat of a Too Pure label all-star team comprised of former Moonshake vocalist/programmer Margaret Fiedler and bassist John Frenett, onetime PJ Harvey drummer Rob Ellis, and noted producer Guy Fixsen as well as ex-God percussionist Lou Ciccotelli and saxophonist/flutist Louise Elliott, Laika formed in London during the autumn of 1993; their debut EP, Antenna, appeared the following summer. Silver Apples of the Moon, the group's acclaimed full-length debut, followed in early 1995; after a hiatus, Laika resurfaced with Sounds of the Satellites in early 1997, garnering even greater critical praise. Good Looking Blues appeared in 2000, followed by Wherever I Am I Am What Is Missing in 2003.
