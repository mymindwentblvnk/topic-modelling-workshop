The malignant, proudly sicilian beast called Wolvesguard first started breathing in 2002, when Uthaar and Necrokultus arranged the first cursed songs. They recorded a three songs demo with the help of a cold and cynic drum machine. The record was an example of Southern Honour and Ancient Pride, but it was never released.. Two years passed, and in april 2006 the two founding members decided to bring the creature back to life with Nefasto on the drums. After various rehersals, Necromortum joined the mortal legion to sing the dark chants of doom.In february 2006, Necromortum left the band to follow some personal projects and after some months in november 2006 Alastor joined the legion to keep on the fight and to raise high our flag of hate! And the battle has just begun.. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wolvesguard">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
