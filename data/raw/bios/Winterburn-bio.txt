  About Winterburn
Thrashin' like the 90's never happened!!!

Formed by Pete and Rich in 2007, Winterburn are a five piece thrash band from Swansea, South Wales. Having been through a series of line up changes since their formation, slowing their progress, these five guys are now ready to induce whiplash wherever the opportunity arises.

So here's the way it goes. If it's not gonna cost us too much to get there and back, we'll pretty much play anywhere. If you want to book us or think we may be suitable for your gig/alldayer/festival/barmitzvah please email us at: winterburnuk@hotmail.co.uk

There are but three rules at a Winterburn show:

1) If you wanna dive, that's cool with us, but get on and get off quickly so there's room for everyone else. 2) Mind the gear while you're up there. 3) Don't dive feet first. That's how people get hurt.

Other than that, our stage is yours. Let's bang our heads and have a most triumphant time together.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Winterburn">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
