Call her a poison apple to hip-hop, Wynne raps with venom, fury, intensity, and consciousness all at once. Born and raised in a Portland suburb, she grew up an outsider, finding solace in her favorite rappers. While studying social justice and music at University of Oregon, she started releasing music of her own online. After a couple years of sparse singles, viral moments, building with Portland's local hip-hop community, and cosigns from some of Hip-Hopâ€™s greats, Wynne is here to deliver her debut mixtape. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wynne">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
