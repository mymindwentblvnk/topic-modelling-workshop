Drown in blood was a band from Hamburg, Germany. Music they created was heavily influenced by Bolt Thrower old Swedish death metal and  stench core bands like Deviated Instinct. Also the band was formed by members of Instinct of survival, so some similarities can be found between those bands. Specially on the crust side of things. They have released an LP called Blood Red Path on label called Institut FÃ¼r Mentale Hygiene and split around 2007.
