Quintessence of the most direct-in-your-face thrash-death style, Methedras sets among the leading underground Italian bands, a real war-machine which has been able to release few demos and four full-lenght albums during its almost 20-years old activity, as well as have performed hundreds of concerts throughout Europe, many of them in support of big names of the international metal scene, without ever losing an ounce of anger and energy.

Combo formed originally near Milan in 1996 with a double-guitar line-up, the band has changed over the years various members preferring in the end a solid line-up with only one guitar, arriving to a proper own style with no compromise: a sort of derived thrash metal spiced with more typical death metal influences and a deep-growl approach concerning the vocals.

Previously under the flag of Punishment 18 Records, with the well-reviewed album "Katarsis" in 2009, the Italian thrashers released their last effort "System Subversion", recorded at the superb Domination Studio under the guide of mastermind Simone Mularoni, in November 2014 through the American label Pavement Entertainment. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Methedras">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
