Presage is a collaborative project between Mr. Dibbs, Jel, and Doseone. Their album, Outer Perimeter, served as the definitive soundtrack for anyone who ever believed in conspiracy theories. Outer Perimeter was originally released as a 2 track cassette tape, and then re-released with separated tracks and additional bullshit that Dibbs and Jel did not approve.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Presage">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
