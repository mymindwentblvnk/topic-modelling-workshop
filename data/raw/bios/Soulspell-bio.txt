Soulspell Metal Opera is a project of the Brazilian musician Heleno Vale. It is the first metal opera project made a hundred percent in Brazil. It is a conceptual album based on a story written by the author that tells about a young man’s life tormented by visions of his past lives.

The 13 tracks of this first album show us versatility, going through moments of tension that lead you to Thrash Metal, along with wonderful piano ballads that show the influence of Hard Rock.

Those were the singers invited to participate: Renato Tribuzy (Tribuzy), Iuri Sanson (Hibria), Leandro Caçoilo (Eterna), Tito Falaschi (ex-Symbols), Christian Passos (Wizards), Nando Fernandes (Hangar), Bruno Maia (Tuatha De Danann), Mário Linhares (ex.Dark Avenger) as well as other great names of the Brazilian Heavy Metal scene.

The musicians who have participated in this project are no less important: Tito Falaschi – Bass (Symbols), José Cardillo – Keyboards (Eterna), Daniel Manso – Guitars (Fairytale), Thiago Amendola – Guitars (Amendola), Cleiton Carvalho – Guitars, Fabiana Doce - keyboards, Heleno Vale - Drums.
