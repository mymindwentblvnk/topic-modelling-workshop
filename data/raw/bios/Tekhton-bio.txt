Tekhton started out as LAHAR in 2002. In 2007 they released their debut album 'Summon the core' was released on 'The Church Within Records'. The second album 'Alluvial' will be released on the 28th of november in 2009. On 'The Church Within Records' again.

Comparisons were made with Cathedral, St. Vitus, Mogwai, Neurosis and Goatsnake to name but a few. The term "Progressive Doom" has been used as a label but what the hell that means is a mistery to the bandmembers themselves.

The band just likes to rock out slowly. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tekhton">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
