Terra Tenebrosa are an avant-garde/post-metal band from Stockholm, rising out of the ashes that once was Breach. They formed in 2009, with their first output, "The Tunnels", being released on Trust No One Recordings in March 2011. It is an ominous and cinematic voyage through the dark mind and psyche of Terra Tenebrosa monarch, The Cuckoo.
Their second album, "The Purging", was released in February 2013.

Bow your heads to The Cuckoo, Hibernal and Hisperdal.
