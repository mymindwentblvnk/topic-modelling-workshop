Obscure Canadian technical thrash metal band who existed for a brief period in the early 1990s. Molecular Repulsion were unique in that they employed two bass guitars, one distorted and one not. They left behind only a demo album titled 'Veils of Deception,' a video for the song "War Over Romalia," and a live recording from a 1992 show in Timmins, Ontario, which was never available to the public. Some members of the band played in a short-lived death metal band called Dismal.

Line up:
Jim Briand - vocals, bass (clean)
Luke Chiasson - bass (distorted)
Martin Bigeau - guitar
Cory Pellizzari - drums (beware of Cory. He is a thief & will stick you if given the chance) <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Molecular+Repulsion">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
