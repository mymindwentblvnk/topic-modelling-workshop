Apocalyptic is a brutal death metal band from Spain. They were formed in 1996. They went on to release a Promo tape in 1998. The band split in 2000 and reunited in 2008 and 2009 only to record their debut album "Ilusiones Morbosas", which was put on download for free at their MySpace page. That does not mean the band is active, since they won't play live anymore.

Their work is heavily inspired by Suffocation.
