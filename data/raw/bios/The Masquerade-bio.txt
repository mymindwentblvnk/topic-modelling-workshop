The Masquerade is a 4 piece indierock band from england, london. They're quite young, so they aren't very successful yet, but they're playing a lot of gigs in london, and they will go big for sure!
They released their first EP, named "Samson EP" a few weeks ago... <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Masquerade">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
