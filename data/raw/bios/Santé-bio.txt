Hardly one clubber didn’t feel or hear at least one track live on the dancefloor by Santé over the last few weeks thanks to a heavy rotation of many different DJs. The current Maxis by Souvenir and Rekids have hit House and Techno floors alike in a time where only good electric dance music is mentioned.
Peaktime Entertainment par excellence. Together the three brothers Philipp, Mathias and Marius are producing under the name Santé. Prior to looking ahead a brief flashback to Swabia, to Ulm to be precise. Because that’s where Santé originates and even though they now live in berlin, funnily their Rekids maxi-single has been signed right away in the local Club Chateu Knarz by Matt Edwards aka Radio Slave when the track was played last in their live set. Good timing is everything. Not only because Philipp has landed in Berlin at the right time and Santé aside has taken over fine-tuning for Ali and Basti Schwarz aka Tiefschwarz in the studio. Furthermore he is running the berlin-based label Souvenir, which has been offering a platform for acts like Steve Lawler, Audiofly,Carl Craig, Sleeperthief, Ruede Hagelstein, Adam Port and Santé. Philipp is bringing the Santé sound alone, as a couple or a trio live and direct to the clubs. Successful ive gigs in clubs like the Weekend, Watergate,Violet Berlin, Robert Johnson, Alte Börse Zürich, Winter Music Conference Miami, Electronic Music Festival Brüssel or Rocker 33 lie behind them. Forthcoming are appearances in Fabric London, Sonar Barcelona, 10 Days Off among others… A votre Santé on the dancefloors around the world <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Sant%C3%A9">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
