Obsidian Throne is a Melodic Death Metal band from Fort Worth, Texas, USA. Beginning life as a more conventional American Death Metal act, Obsidian Throne over time evolved a more European sound, eschewing the hardcore influences, violent gore lyrics and emphasis on technicality of many of their countrymen in favour of a more streamlined, melodic approach akin to several Swedish bands, incorporating influences from Opeth, Immortal, Amon Amarth, and many others.

In 2006, the band released their demo (Pandemic) followed by an EP (Behind the Veil) in 2008. An active live band, Obsidian Throne has shared the stage with the likes of Decapitated, Vader, Nevermore, Destruction, Finntroll, Marduk, and many others in their native USA. In 2008 the band were also invited to play their first international gig at the Inferno Festival in Oslo, Norway where they were very well received by the European crowd and press.

The band have since recorded and released their first full-length album titled, "The Unquiet Grave" which has been well received by their peers. The CD showcases 12 tracks and over an hour of precise, well executed melodic metal. Currently, the band have since parted ways with original singer Chris Sweigart and Rhythm guitarist Cory Miller and have replaced them with Jarrod Butler and Dave Kaplan, respectively. The group is now working on new material for their next album, which will be out in 2011, and is getting back out to the live stage. Stay tuned!
