Trash kit are Rachel Aggs, Rachel Horwood and Ros Murray, from London, UK. The two Rachels also play in The Madrigals, and Ros plays in  Electrelane, and Ray Rumours. They formed in 2008.

Mixing chaos and trippy melody in equal measure, Trash Kit are as jubilant as they are focussed. Vocals tangle with each other and highly expressive drum patterns, while guitar lines make for a serious adventure into the realms of party. So far they have a CD-R, which keeps selling out at shows, an LP out now on Upset The Rhythm and a split 7" with Woolf on MILK records. "Chinese Boy" also appeared on the 2009 Methodist Leisure Inc. freebie punk and noise compilation 'Short Attention Span'. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Trash+Kit">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
