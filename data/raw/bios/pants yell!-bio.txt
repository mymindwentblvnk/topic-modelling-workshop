Pants Yell! started in earnest the spring of 2003 within the walls of a Boston art school. In their time together they've released a debut album, 'Songs for Siblings', a 7" single, appeared on numerous compilations, and have completed three East Coast Tours. Shows have been played with Islands, Jens Lekman, The Microphones, The Radio Dept., Casiotone for the Painfully Alone, Ponies in the Surf, Cass McCombs, Young People, the Pathways, UV. Protection, the Diskettes, Big Digits, Soltero, the Impossible Shapes, Thanksgiving, and Cause Co-Motion. 

In August they traveled to Europe to play shows throughout Sweden, England, and Iceland.

'Recent Drama' is their second album and was recorded over the better part of a year on 2 inch 24 track tape. This is an album of concise, intricate, and intelligent pop songs the way the Clean, the Pastels, or Aisler Set wrote concise, intricate, and intelligent pop songs.

Pants Yell! disbanded in May 2010, although the band CUFFS comprises of 2/3rds of the Pants Yell! line-up. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pants+Yell%21">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
