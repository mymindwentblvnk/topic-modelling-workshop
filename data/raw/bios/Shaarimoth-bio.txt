In the year of wrath, 2004, a new death metal act was created by former members of Antarctica, Rune Andreassen and Frode Ramsland. Soon to by joined by Haakon Drakul Forwald (founder of the Norwegian Disiplin), we created a monster that finally is about to unleashed upon the human race. Even though inspired by music like Morbid Angel, Behemoth, Deicide and so forth, the Shaarimoth-beast also tries to go new ways, exploring new gaps and bringing some of the true essence back to the scene.

Shaarimoth is an organism, created to manifest satanic dark currents by the means of music. By entering the subconscious mind of the listener, Shaarimoth will act as a passage, creating portals from within the listeners mind, and opening passageways to those currents.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Shaarimoth">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
