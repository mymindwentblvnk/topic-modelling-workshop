Born in the town Heerlen in the south of the Netherlands. In his early teens music took a hold of Noud's life after receiving a gift from his neighbour: a package with vinyl records from artists like Deep Purple, Steppenwolf and Jimi Hendrix ! Coming from a family who loves music (both his grandfathers used to sing in a choir and his father played saxophone for 9 years) Noud bought his his first electric guitar at the age of 15 and started taking lessons. It was time to start playing live with local bands.

In 2011 Noud presents a new album Nothing but everyhing wil remain Being a perfectionist, the new album took about 3 years of writing and recording. In april 2011 Tommie Bonajo (Blindsight) makes the final mix and master of the album at his Tomsterproject studio The album is recorded in the netherlands and in New York and besides Noud Smeets on 7 and 8 string guitars there are a lot of great guestmusicians.
