Bass-less Detroit garage punk band formed in 1986 by Mick Collins [vocals, guitar] (currently of The Dirtbombs fame), Margaret Ann O'Neill [drums], and Dan Kroha [vocals, guitar] (later of the now defunct Demolition Doll Rods).  The band released 3 LPs and several 7 inch singles. They disbanded in 1992 and their blues influences have been identified as an important influence on several garage rock bands, such as The White Stripes. Collins went on to form Blacktop and, as aforementioned, The Dirtbombs. They reunited around 2019 and are still playing.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Gories">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
