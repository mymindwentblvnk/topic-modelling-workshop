Eef Barzelay (born Ifar Barzelay in Tel Aviv, Israel, on May 12, 1970) is an Israeli-born American musician. Mostly known as the principal songwriter and singer of alt country band Clem Snide, Barzelay has been performing since 1991. Early on this included stints in a number of Boston-based bands, while later he has toured as a solo act, both as headliner and as international support.

Barzelay was raised in Teaneck, New Jersey. He enjoys old-timey music but also has an out-of-left-field interest in the apocalyptic and the ways human folly and failure might influence it.

In 2006 Barzelay released his debut solo album entitled Bitter Honey. In 2007 he composed many original tracks for the film Rocket Science. Barzelay's second solo album, Lose Big, was released on June 17, 2008 on 429 records. Barzelay's breakout performance on April 2, 2008 at Juanita K. Hammons Hall on the campus of Missouri State University catapulted him into international superstardom. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Eef+Barzelay">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
