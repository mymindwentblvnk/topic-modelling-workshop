Destiny Nicole Frasqueri, better known by her stage name Princess Nokia is an American rapper of Puerto Rican descent, signed to Rough Trade Records.

Frasqueri recorded her first song, "Destiny", in 2010, and released it under the name of Wavy Spice on her SoundCloud and her YouTube channel in mid-2012. It was largely autobiographical and gained modest popularity. Subsequently, she released her second track, "Bitch I'm Posh". The track went viral, and as of December 2017, received 110,000 plays on Soundcloud. Frasqueri then released YAYA, which was a commentary of perceptions of colonial history. Frasqueri continued to release singles, such as Dragons, a Game of Thrones inspired piece, Honeysuckle, and Vicki Gotti until changing her moniker to Princess Nokia. She released her mixtape, 1992, on Soundcloud. She also began touring.

Frasqueri was praised for her feminism, especially after confronting a man yelling racial slurs on a subway train. She also founded the Smart Girls Club, a podcast where she discusses healthy living and "urban feminism".

Frasqueri claims Princess Nokia is an alter ego, which she introduced with the track "Nokia". She released an album named Metallic Butterfly on May 12, 2014, and was debuted on Vice and Soundcloud.

On September 8, 2017, she released her debut studio album, 1992 Deluxe, which was an expanded version of her 2016 mixtape, 1992. It peaked at number 25 on Billboard's Heatseekers Albums chart. NME listed it as the 32nd best album of 2017.
