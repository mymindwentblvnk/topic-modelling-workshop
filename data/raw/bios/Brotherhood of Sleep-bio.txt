BROTHERHOOD OF SLEEP is a consistent effort to play 'out of the box' doom/stoner music mixed with psychedelic rock, on an instrumental basis. 

The band has had 2 full-length albums so far: "Brotherhood Of Sleep" (2009) and "Dark As Light" (2011), their contribution to Spinalonga recs compilation titled "Miss Fortune Was A Henhouse Manager" (2011) with the track "Ain Berashyth", and is continuing to progress and keeping active ever since its first day of formation. Numerous live shows as headliners or as support acts since 2006, a mini-tour in central Europe in 2011 and their first headline european tour ("Doom Reigns") in late August 2012.

Brotherhood Of Sleep continue their evolution, on their way for their third album, looking forward to the next steps to take along this musical path. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Brotherhood+of+Sleep">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
