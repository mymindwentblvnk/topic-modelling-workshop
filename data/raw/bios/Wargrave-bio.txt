Wargrave is a thrash metal band from Cape Town, South Africa. 

Formed in late 2010 in the depths of the Cape Town underground, Wargrave lay dormant for a couple of months before making it's presence known. Originally spawned in the creative outlet of guitarist Justin Ross, the band evolved into an amalgamation of the collective talents of 5 individuals.

While the roots of the band lie deep in 80's thrash metal, Wargrave draws inspiration from an extremely diverse spectrum, infusing the classic archetypal sound with undertones drawn from modern progressive and technical death metal. The result is a sonic apocalypse, a display of speed and technical proficiency whilst maintaing a strong sense of melody.
