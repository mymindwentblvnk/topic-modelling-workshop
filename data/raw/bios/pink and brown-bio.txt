Pink and Brown were a noise rock/punk rock band from San Francisco, California, formed in 1997 when the members moved west from their old home of Providence, RI. The band consisted of two members: Pink (John Dwyer) and Brown (Jeff Rosenberg). Pink played guitar and sang while Brown played drums. The band was influenced by the sounds and styles of bands such as Olneyville Sound System and Lightning Bolt.

The band's live shows (the first ever of which was at O'Brien's in Allston, MA) featured a chaotic and frenetic performance from both members. The San Francisco Bay Guardian described their live sound as “Korean folk drumming gone punk.” Both members would appear onstage in outlandish outfits that corresponded with their colorful pseudonyms.

The band broke up in 2003. On their message board they announced their disbanding simply: "Mommy and daddy still love you but they just can't stay married. We hope this doesn't put a damper on your childhood but we think you'll be just fine."

Dwyer went on to play with Coachwhips and The Hospitals. He is currently playing with the Ohsees (aka OCS) and Yikes. Rosenberg is a past member of Young People and The Jews, and is currently one fourth of Lavender Diamond. He also makes ambient guitar music under his own name (Jeff Rosenberg). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Pink+and+Brown">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
