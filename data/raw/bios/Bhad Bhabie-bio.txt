Danielle Peskowitz Bregoli (born March 26, 2003), also known by her stage name as Bhad Bhabie is an American social media personality and rapper. She became known for the viral video meme and catch phrase "catch me outside" after appearing on the Dr. Phil show in September 2016. She released her debut single as a recording artist in late August 2017.

Bregoli appeared on the television series Dr. Phil in September 2016 to discuss her bad behavior, which went viral in January 2017. During the episode, she used the phrase "Catch me outside, how about that?" (often transliterated as "Cash Me Ousside How Bout Dah"), which later became a viral video and meme. According to Danielle's mother, the phrase means sheâ€™ll go outside and do what she has to do (she threatened to fight the audience, telling them to "cash her ousside").

Bregoli released her first single "These Heaux" (pronounced "these hoes") on August 26, 2017. The recording reached number 77 on the Billboard Hot 100, making Bregoli the youngest female rap artist to debut on the music chart. The success of "These Heaux" prompted Atlantic Records to sign Bregoli to a multi-album recording contract. In September 2017, she remixed the Kodak Black song "Roll In Peace" and Tee Grizzley and Lil Yachty song "From the D to the A". On September 22, 2017, she released "Hi Bich" and a day after, "Whachu Know", as a single alongside the music video, which received over a million views in 24 hours. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bhad+Bhabie">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
