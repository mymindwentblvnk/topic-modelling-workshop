The Ottoman Empire was a five-piece melodic progressive thrash metal band originating out of lower Wisconsin.  They featured harsh yet melodic female vocals and heavy, technical instrumental work.  Resembling bands such as Iced Earth, Dream Theater, Arch Enemy, Iron Maiden and Pantera, they have sufficiently dominated the Milwaukee metal scene.
They are now signed to Century Media and have changed their name to Luna Mortis. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Ottoman+Empire">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
