Push Button Objects (or PBO) is the alias of Edgar Farinas, a producer of IDM. His style of music uses hip-hop as a underlying foundation, but with the addition of DSP-processed sounds, unusual samples, elements of electro, Detroit techno, Miami bass, jungle, and other musical rudiments somewhat alien to the genre of hip-hop, but with unique results. PBO's sound is comparable to his contemporaries like Prefuse 73 and Dabrye.

Farinas is also one-half of Ko-Wreck Technique, with DJ Craze, as well as recording an EP under the name Guineo.

Push Button Objects has released albums for labels such as Chocolate Industries, Skam Records, and Schematic Records, with his self-titled debut EP being released on the latter.

Push Button Objects is currently inactive and has no future releases planned. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Push+Button+Objects">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
