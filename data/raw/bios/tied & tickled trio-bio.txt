Tied & Tickled Trio is surprisingly a quartet, based in Munich and Berlin. It started off as a drum duo project but has turned into a rather complex music approach, as it fuses dub electronica with jazzy elements, and occasionally, with the help of various saxophone- and trumpet players, breaks into climaxes that can rather be defined as post-rock meeting jazz. The group has released the albums EA1 EA2 and Observing Systems and some EPs on the record label Morr Music.

Band members:
Ulrich Wangenheim (tenor saxophone, bass clarinet, flute)
