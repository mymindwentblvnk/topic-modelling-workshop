Varathron are a Greek black metal band in a similar vein to early Rotting Christ and Necromantia. They formed in 1988. Following the Greek style, the band builds a lot of ambience and progression using strong melodic & hypnotic guitar work and slower doomy/death peaceful moments amongst the occasional bursts of chaos very typical of Greek black metal. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Varathron">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
