Multiple artists are known as Powell:

1. London-based producer Oscar Powell‘s music is to techno what Jandek’s is to rock ‘n roll: a thoroughly emaciated, obtuse and primitivist take on a familiar sound, with scant regard paid to such trifling concerns as melody or narrative development.

3. Powell is born by the meeting between musicians from Le Mans, France, sharing same musical energy inspired by the indie rock scene (Fugazi, ENGINE DOWN, PORTOBELLO BONES, KARATE...). Powell's music combines felted environments and explosive energy in order to show a rough and minimal universe; texts are only there to underline and describe this universe. Between instantaneous photographs and descriptions of precise moments.
