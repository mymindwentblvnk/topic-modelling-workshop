Sick of a tired scene in a tired town, Transient Messiah began with the connection of a drummer and a guitarist. The simple goal was to create songs that simply destroyed and punished those who dared listen.

Formed officially in the late fall of 2009, the band began writing songs and finalizing a line up. Shortly after, TRANSIENT MESSIAH began destroying crowds with straight up, no bullshit riffs, a technical rhythm section, and sonically charged screams.

In April 2010, after a few local shows, TRANSIENT MESSIAH recorded their first EP "Blood On the Horizon."

Today, the band continues to bring its energetic and enigmatic show to the masses of Eureka, CA. As the band grows, so does its followers.

Transient Messiah aims to create, believe, develop, and conquer. Open your mind and behold TRANSIENT MESSIAH. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Transient+Messiah">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
