Matt Duncan is a classically trained instrumentalist and songwriter in his mid-20s. “Beacon” features smooth vocals, brilliant lyrics, and jawdropping syncopation, perfect pitch and painstaking, perfectionistic production.

A Lafayette High School alum, Duncan first gained attention with the now-defunct Parlour Boys, one of Lexington’s strongest indie bands in decades. A pianist and vocalist who also plays bass, guitar and a number of other instruments, Duncan is also a member of the band Englishman, a project of Andrew English.

Matt Duncan’s 5-song EP is in the Top 10 Local Bestsellers of 2010 list at CD Central. And mind you, that list included Apples In Stereo, who had a little bit of a head start, and the remarkable Ben Sollee and Daniel Martin Moore Subpop release, “Dear Companion.”

But Duncan’s CD is also on the bestseller list of all music, checking in at No. 5, just in front of Vampire Weekend. It has been picked up by the indie music tipster aggregator site Hype Machine and also used, under license, as music on recent episodes of the television shows “Vampire Diaries” and “Private Practice.”
