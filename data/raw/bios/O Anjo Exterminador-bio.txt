An industrial meltdown of grindcore, death and black metal, dark ambiance and experimental electronics, 'TETRAGRAMMATON', O Anjo Exterminador's (Portuguese for EXTERMINATING ANGEL) debut runs for 71 minutes of grinding holocaustic avant garde metal music. (Or so it would like to be!).

Including in the lyrics about the occult and metaphysical concepts are glyphs, combinations and secrets only the most adventurous listener will be able to put together. 

The booklet Includes fantasy artwork by Brazilian sci fi/horror artist Edgar Franco (responsible for the artwork of the french band MELEK-THA) and a colored poster of the famous dark creature Cthulhu, created by H.P. Lovecraft, designed by the lead singer and composer Joaquim Ghirotti.

A weird, wild symphony of experimental metal destruction designed to take you in a journey of over one hour of violent music to mangle your ears!

Band started in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, 2003. They split just after the release of the album in late 2005.

Released 05 December 2005
