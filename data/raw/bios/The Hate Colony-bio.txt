This five-headed metal monster from Trondheim, Norway is a living proof that Norwegian heavy music isnÂ´t all about black metal. The norwegian aggression, the swede-inspired melodies, and the american ground and pound riffs, it all comes together in this brutal mix of genuine musicianship.

2. September 2011 will see the release of their debutalbum titled "Dead Or Victorious", and like the title says, this is what the band is all about. Blood, sweat, sacrifice and brotherhood.

Be sure to check out the new video for "Your Murder Scene"!
