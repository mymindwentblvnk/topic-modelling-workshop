Fates Creation is from Lehigh Acres, Florida. There are four members of this band: Gary Sloan - Vocalist, Guitar, 
            Dan Sigler - Lead Guitar, Backup Vocals
            Steve Ralston - Bass Guitar, Backup Vocals
            Tracy Woods - Drums
They are an all original band. Fate brought these four men together, and together they are banging out some kickass music. This CD is their first album, they are currently in the studio working on their second CD. Which from what I hear is heavier than the first. They are hoping to be ready to hit the road after the first of the year, to bring their sound to the people live, so stay tuned for details. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fates+Creation">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
