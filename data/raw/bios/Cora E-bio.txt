Cora E., also well known as the Zulu-Queen (* 1968 in Kiel; born Sylvia Macco) is a German Rapper and one of the pioneers of the German Hip Hop Movement.

She is a trained nurse and came to Heidelberg to work the psychiatric department of the university clinic. After getting in touch with graffiti and breakdance, she got to know rap, the musical element of Hip Hop. In 1988 she stood on stage for the first time.

Cora E.'s music and lyrics became decisively influenced by a two-year stay in New York, the Mecca of Hip Hop. Immediately after that particular turning point, she collaborated with the Leipzig resident Hip Hop group "Beside The standard", then - from 1992 - with the Hamburger DJ and producer Marius No. 1 and performed side-by-side with legendary Breakdance-crews such as Battle Squad or the Taino Tactix and Rap-groups such as Advanced Chemistry, LSD, Stieber Twins and No Remorze.  

She officially withdrew from Hip Hop in 2001 and since then has led Rap-workshops for kids. After this she was to be heard on two publications:  2004 on the album "Geteiltes Leid II" of Moses Pelham and 2005 with the song "Fragen" on the album "Threeshot" of J-Luv.  This gave rise to speculations about a possible comeback.    

Cora E. has only made one album so far, called "CoraGe" in 1998.
