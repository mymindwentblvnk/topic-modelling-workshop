Atrorum is the two-man project of the chronically overdemanded musicians  Fabian Ziegler (beNUTS, the neighbours, dryad's tree, golden dawn, truEvil) and  jaspeR werhahN (the neighbours, dryad's tree, golden dawn, sternenstaub, nebelkraehe), where both can live their love for complex arrangements in the dark/black/avantgarde metal field. 
Formed in 2002, the first album "Himmelsst√ºrmer" was released as self-produced demo in 2004 and sent around magazines in europe. the second album "Exhibition" was released two years later and brought along first negotiations with labels. due to other musical projects and their real lives, atrorum paused after 2007.

At the end of 2011 after several collaboration with other bands (and after parting together from the bands "Dryad's Tree" and "Golden Dawn") both came again together and started writing and recording a new album which is still in progress.
