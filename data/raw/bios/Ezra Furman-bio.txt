Ezra Furman is a singer and songwriter from Chicago, Illinois. It is difficult to peg her as part of a single musical genre because she loves to experiment with different styles of songwriting. Suffice it to say that Ezra makes up songs and plays them on her acoustic guitar with ferocious energy and gut wrenching sincerity. Her music is derivative of, but never completely part of, a number of musical genres: rock, blues, punk, folk and pop are some prime examples. 

Since Ezra got a guitar for her bar mitzvah, she's been working relentlessly toward capturing some of the grandeur, mystery, pain and headlong wildness of life in song. The results are by turns beautiful, charming, funny, angry, poignant and inspirational. 

A lot of Ezra's songs can be heard on the series 'Sex Education'.

Her latest record 'Twelve Nudes' is a brilliant angry punk record.
