In the far time ago, in the furyhole of the putrid Kosmos, Grom cum forth to fuck everybody. But only find he the woman and so he finds a way inside her, to the blasting of his white torpedoes and thick burning javelin. This is how we are to here, in the mothervolcano, for ever. We are Skeld, Blüst, Khøøød. We are the Kult of Grom. Gromkult we are. Give prase to Grom for wrape the sky and create the dirtplace we are lives on. Stab face and blood the ground for thanks to he. GIVE PRASE, YE OLD DIRTPLACE. BLOOD THE GROUND, SPREAD THE HELLSOUND, MAKE FUCK IN THE ZIONHOUSES. HEIL GROM.

Skeld - guitars, droms, vox, massage
Blüst - giatrs, droms, vox, prayers
