There are 3 Habitat artists on last fm: Swedish, Latin and USA
1) Swedish Death Metal band (Malmk√∂ping) formed in 1991. Side project of Leukemia members. Released 'Entombed in Habitat' demo in '91.
2) Spanish rock band with lightly experimental passages that makes them truly remarkable on the ROCK EN ESPANOL turf. A blend of angular guitars, driving bass and warm drumming makes them unique in the Latin alternative world. Their rock N  roll blend is a breath of fresh air that walks away from corporate driven radio music and uses pop sensibilities to take you on a mysterious, introspective journey. http://myspace.com/habitatspace / http://www.elhabitat.com
