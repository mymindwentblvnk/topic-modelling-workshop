A bandname that’s a curse and a blessing at the same time. What an awesome slogan! 
You definitely have to spray that on walls, wear it as a shirt or curve it in somewhere. 
No one will forget it that easily, but it also demands effort above all levels of expectation. 
With that claim supporting them, NICO CHAM, TIM HANSEN, ROMEO SFENDULES and DAMIAN PALM (who come from Stellingen, the most unglamorous district from Hamburg, by the way) 
have terrific plans ahead, but also great stories behind them already. 
Long before the now finally released debut album the band set up distinct milestones like several digital singles and EPs as well as surprisingly many - and always euphorically celebrated - live gigs. 
To name some highlights: Main stage at Dockville Festival and shows at SXSW in Austin and New York. With „Atlas“ the long distance capability of the hamburgers FUCK ART, LET’S DANCE! finally is getting tested. “Lovers Arcade”, which was released in 2012, was more of a minialbum consisting of EP-Tracks. But now things are getting serious as hell. 

FUCK a world that is lost in standstill. FUCK the shackles which keep you locked in one place. FUCK the life that orders you into dependence. FUCK this and FUCK that.
