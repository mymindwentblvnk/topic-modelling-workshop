My name is Tyler Carter. I am a rising singer/songwriter trying my hardest to follow my dreams and inspire my fans along the journey. I am from a small town called Habersham, Georgia. I recide in both Atlanta, Georgia and Buffalo, New York. You will find me on tour most of the time with my band Issues. I have always been influenced by artists such as Justin Timberlake, Usher, Christina Aguilera, and Beyonce, therefore I lean more towards an R&B/Pop style with my music. In and out of by band I consider myself an R&B singer, though my two separate lifestyles are tamed differently. I want to be the next big popstar... but anyone who has seen Woe, Is Me on tour will know that I am on the track to being the next big Rockstar. Gotta love my life, follow your dreams. Ambitions are what keep you alive. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tyler+Carter">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
