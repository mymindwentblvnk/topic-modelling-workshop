Bio:
We are a Newcastle Metal band established late 2010. Quickly rising from opening slots to regularly headlining local shows, playing alongside some of Australia's elite metal bands like Mortal Sin, Ouroboros and Frankenbok, and also opening for Cavalera Conspiracy. War Faction have a unique sound, which based on varied influences within the band, is ever progressing. With an album just released, consistently brutal live performances, and hosting multiple metal bands at Bunker party's, the band is a major force in the local metal community.
