Life's Decay is a duo band, based in Paris, France.
Since its creation, six main albums were born together with an EP, a rare tracks album and a Vinyl disc.

Lyktwasst started the project at the beginning of 2003, realizing everything from the concept to the accomplishment.
In 2005, he began working with Alea, feminine singer and lyric writer. In 2008 she also started to work on the music by introducing classical acoustic instruments as a composer.

Life's Decay has the will to create a personal universe, musically and visually, influenced by eclectic universes: dark classical acoustic music, steampunk industrial, experimental pop-rock...
A big musical evolution occurred between the first album and the later releases. 
Lyktwasst and Alea unite their passion of music and innovation to offer different albums from one to another, invested and anchored in their own universe.

The graphics also has a huge importance in the project. Lyktwasst creates artworks made of solid black and white which establish a “retro – luxury” universe. Music and visuals are completely connected. As a “Dot it yourself” concept, he also realizes all the photographs, music videos, websites etc...

Lyktwasst created the label " Abstraktsens Produktions " in 2004 to assure the production, the promotion and the distribution of Life Decay. All the CD and the other productions of the project were released on this label.
