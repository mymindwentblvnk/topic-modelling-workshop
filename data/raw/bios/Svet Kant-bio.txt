Dublin's most experimental and genre-blending quartet pushed and defied the boundaries of the metal world with the release of Loneliness (2013).  New sonic landscapes and tantalizing harmonic textures are explored in their new sophomore full album "The Visage Unbiased".

Formed in early 2011, Svet Kant became Santiago Kodela's main priority after leaving Argentina behind.  Through a quest of experimenting and defying the boundaries of the metal genre, Svet Kant re-designs both harmony and rhythm while defining a unique and un-missable personal sound.  Completing line-up with Daragh Kenny (drums), Liamroy (guitars) and Noface (bass), the band constantly amazes audiences with their powerful and crushing performances.

"The Visage Unbiased" sees Svet Kant working for the first time with Ireland's top metal producer Michael Richards (Dead Label, Cruachan) at Trackmix Studio on tracking and mixing; with final mastering at New York's Sterling Sound by the hand of legendary engineer Ted Jensen (Deftones, Pantera, Alice in Chains, Gojira).

The vocal coaching by Judith Mok (Eddie Vedder, Thom Yorke, Mick Jagger) and a guest appearance by soprano Rebecca Rodgers (Northern Ireland Opera) bring a unique and forward-thinking touch to the overall album, completely departing from the paradigms and rules of the metal genre.
