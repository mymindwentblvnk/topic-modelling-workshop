Tex Beneke was born in Texas. He joined the Glenn Miller Orchestra in 1938 as a tenor saxophonist. He quickly became a star with the orchestra with his easy going manner, casual sounding voice and mellifluous saxophone playing. One night while riding to a gig with Glenn Miller in a car, they discussed tunes and Tex suggested a song he knew called "Ida". He sang it to Miller and Miller is reported to have said, "you know, Tex, we should write an arrangement for you to do that tune." They did and he did. It became a hit in 1939 and after that he became a featured singer with the band recording big hits like "I Got a Gal in Kalamazoo", "Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree", "Chatanooga Choo Choo" and "I Never Knew". He later took over the band after Miller's death during the war. He led it from 1946 to 1948 and changed the name to the Tex Beneke Orchestra. He passed away in May of 2000. The band continues under his name and is led by Jim Snodgrass. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tex+Beneke">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
