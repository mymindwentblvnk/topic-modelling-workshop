Formed in the boggiest of the boggy depths of Mayo, Ireland in March 2008, On Pain of Death play slow and twisted doom/sludge metal. The band played their first gig in June '08 and recorded their self-titled first demo over that same weekend and the next in Oaks Recording, Enniskillen, NI. The band continued to play throughout the Summer and returned to Oaks at the end of September to record their next EP which features one slab of degrading filth called "Rotting in a Tomb of Depravity". Not happy with the outcome of the recorded EP, OPoD decided to shelf the release with an intention to rework and re-record the track for a future release. A cover version of the Sepultura track Troops of Doom was recorded and released on vinyl by Blinddate Records in December '09. The release featured bands such as Moloch, Thou, Aguirre, Loss and Hey Colossus all doing doomed out covers. In June 2010 OPoD began recording a new three track album titled "Year Naught Doom" available now as digital download from: http://handshakeinc.bandcamp.com/album/year-naught-doom-2 <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/On+Pain+of+Death">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
