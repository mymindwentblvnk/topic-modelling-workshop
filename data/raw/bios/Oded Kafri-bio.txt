Oded Kafri was born in Tel Aviv, Israel. He began playing the drums at the age of ten. By the age of sixteen he moved to Paris, and was introduced to new drumming styles such as jazz, afro and funk. His playing style is characterized by a thorough dedication on time-keeping and swing, a great dynamic spectrum and an ability to play several styles of music very sensitively. These qualities may be the reason for his very wide use as a session drummer in musical settings of great variety.
