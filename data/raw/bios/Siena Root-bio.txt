Siena Root is a Swedish fourpiece that's been filling houses in the Stockholm underground scene since the end of the last century. The classic but original sound is based on heavy organ, strat leads, bass riffing and big drums with bluesy soulful vocals on top.

In 2003, Siena Root signed a deal with the English label "Rage of Achilles" and a year later, the debut "A New Day Dawning" was released on CD as well as LP.

In the summer 2005, Siena Root went through a reshaping. Sanya stepped in behind the microphone when Oskar decided to take an early retirement. Lead guitarist KG West became the one to also step in behind the Hammond. Now Siena Root was ready to release a new vinyl single, this time in cooperation with Nasoni records in Berlin.

Through touring the music has developed in such a way, that jamming and improvising has become an essential element, always keeping you on the edge of your seat. Their concerts are dramatic and exciting, visually, as well as emotionally. It's a dynamic rootrock experience.

In the sense that blues is blue, hard rock is black, reggae is pan African coloured, this music has the colour of siena. It is a warm, earthy colour, originally from the muddy roots of Toscana. Because this sound has roots that go deep, it felt natural to let “root” be a part of the name. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Siena+Root">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
