Marnost is an atmospheric/noise black metal band from Czech republic. Their songs are usually about 10 minutes long and build on old poems of rebelious authors such as William Blake, Jiří Wolker or Heiner Müller. The band started to play shows recently backed up with a wall of cabinets and amps. They come from harcore/punk underground scene and members are or were also in gattaca, lakme, remek, dakhma, osawatomie and other bands. Given this background they are strongly opposed to fascism and other oppressive ideologies and support struggles for freedom and self-determination. So far they have released a demo, 2 splits and a single soundtrack song.
