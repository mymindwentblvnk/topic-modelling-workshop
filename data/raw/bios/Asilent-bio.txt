Asilent was brought fort by Fiaz on bass guitar in October 2004. 

Fiaz then approached Farhan, who used to play in the same band with him before, to take on the guitarist position. The assembly was almost complete, but they were still missing a Skins Blaster/Drummer. Months passed and entered Kenny, an old friend of the band, who was called in the drummer for Asilent. 

Fiaz proposed Emile to take up the vocalist position and tried his new role out for their rehearsals. Emile turned out to have a hidden talent behind the microphone and projected such viciousness and intensity in his vocals that left the band stunned. 

The year now is 2011, and most unfortunately, with a tinge of regret. Emile has officially left Asilent due to unforeseen circumstances. Emile is still good friends with the guys. We wish him the very best in his future endeavours. 

We are proud to have Danial Dahl on board to take over vocal duties... Also we have Nizam of Whorehouse Butchery fame on guitars...
