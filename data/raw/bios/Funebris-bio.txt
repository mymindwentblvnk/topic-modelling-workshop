FUNEBRIS was formed 1998 in Munich, Germany by:
Wulfen (Ruunvarg) / Manuel Iosca (Git.)
Arcanus Noctem / Michael Z.(Voc.)
 Narg / Rainer J. (Drums)

Also members: Krell / Thomas K. (Bass), Serenitus / Stefan B. (2nd Git) and Nick C.K. (Bass).

After the release of  a Demo CD called Warriors of The Unlight, the band catched a deal with an Indi Label (LAST EPISODE).
A limited EP called  Retaliation has also been relesed as the only one FUNEBRIS Album Triupmph Of The Everlasting Fire, in 2001.

Because of Last Episodes rip-off-action with all of their bands, but also because of internal problems within the band, they decided to spilt the band. This was in the year 2002

The most ex-members of FUNEBRIS are active in other munich metal bands.
