A combination of braggadocio and introspection, realism and imagination, wordplay and lyricism, all balanced out by a dash of humor. This is what best describes Kenn Starr, a self-proclaimed MC's emcee. This Suffolk, Virginia native penned his first rhyme at the age of ten and hasn't stopped since. He credits his versatile style to his exposure to hip-hop at an early age. Growing up listening to a wide variety of hip-hop/rap music, his inspirations range from A Tribe Called Quest to the late TuPac, but he credits many of rap's lesser-recognized lyricists as his biggest influences. When asked what he feels he brings to the table, Starr replies "A return to the essence of hip-hop, when it was about head-nodding beats and thought-provoking lyrics. I'm looking to shift the focus back on skills."

Currently residing in Fort Washington, Maryland, Starr maintains that VA will "always be home", and is looking to put the state, as well as the D.C.-metropolitan area, on the map as a slept-on goldmine of unsigned talent. He plans to do this with the help of his crew, Low Budget, a talented collective of artists and producers whose common bond is their love for hip-hop in particular, and music in general. The crew consists of Oddisee, Cy Young, Kev Brown, Critically Acclaimed, Sean Born, as well as many others.                

When asked what he hopes to accomplish with his music, Starr replied, "Earning the respect of the hip-hop community and to be recognized lyrically as one of the elite. Basically, I just want people to feel me." Currently working on a number of projects, including several tracks for Halftooth Record's premier release and a solo LP, it's safe to say that he is well on his way. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kenn+Starr">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
