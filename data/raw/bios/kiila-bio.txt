Kiila is a Finish experimental folk band founded in Ulvila, Finland in 1993 by Niko-Matti Ahti and Sami Sänpäkkilä. The band first worked as a duo and played their first show in Pori, a city near by, in 1995. Since that Kiila has shifted through many phases, seen many events and had many members. The composition of the group has always varied quite effortlessly according to the needs of the band and the people in it.

Tuota tuota, the third full-length album by Kiila, was released on 27 May 2009. The songs were born of peaceful, focused work and intense rehearsals, interspersed with sleep and mealtimes. The album features an eight-strong core line-up but, as always, it involves many of the band's friends. Tuota tuota develops around its seven songs that touch on the nature of knowledge and work, the fluctuations of inspiration and threat.
