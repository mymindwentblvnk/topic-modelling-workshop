Chris Reifert's first band (although Dean Sharp seems to have been the only core member). Recorded two demos. According to Reifert, both were recorded in 1985, of which Frightmare was the second. Other sources, however, indicate the other demo was recorded in 1986, by which time Reifert had left the band. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Burnt+Offering">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
