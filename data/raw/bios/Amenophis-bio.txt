There are two bands that go by the name 'Amenophis'.

(1) Melodic Black Metal band Amenophis started to play in 1998 and recorded a demo, but "Heretic Solstice of Darkest Gleam" was never released and the band split up in 1999 for personal reasons. Singer Jean-Philippe Poirier (Moloch), guitarist Sylvain Carrier (Seth) and Dominic Rouleau (Imhotep) reformed the band in 2000 with new members: Souldamned (drums), Blod (guitar), Anubis (session - bass) and Ken Ménard (bass).

"The Element of Torture" was recorded in April 2004 at Mid-Altech Studio St-Émile (QC), produced by Amenophis & Patrice Guértin. The band recorded a mini-CD in 2004: "Winds of Lethal Essences: Chapter One" (limited to 45 copies) and then, in 2005, their first and only release: "The Element of Torture: Chapter Two".  The band split up again in late 2005.

Amenophis played in Quebec and Montreal with bands such as: Behemoth (Pol), Necronomicon (Can), I.N.R.I.TUAL (Can), Quo Vadis, and Nefastus Dies.
