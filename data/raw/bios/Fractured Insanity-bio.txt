Fractured Insanity is a Brutal Death Metal band from Moorsele, Belgium. They formed in 2004 by  Kenny (Lead Guitar), Dieter (Guitar, Pulverize), Didier (Bass, Fleshmould) and Ignace (Drums, Huldrefolk and Aguynguerran). Later Svograth (Omega Centauri, Sanctus Nex) completed the line-up on vocals. They mix death and gore with their twisting, stop-start catch riffs and hard-tuned drums to create an original piece of death metal.

In 2008 Svograth left the band and was replaced by Cid (Aeons of Old, Borderline Denial).

Shortly before the recording of their latest effort "Mass Awakeless", Cid left the band and
Bert "Fafa" filled in the spot.

The band self-released an EP "The Ethics of Nihility" in 2006 which put together an awesome crush of guitars and engery into the brutal death metal scene. This got them a contract with death metal specialists Goregiastic Records. This lead to their debut full-length album "When Mankind becomes Diseased" in 2007, which, with it's matured sounds, twisting guitars and harsh growls got the band solid reviews.
