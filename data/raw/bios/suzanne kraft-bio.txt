Suzanne Kraft is the solo moniker of Los Angeles-based producer and DJ Diego Herrera, who is also a member of neo-disco group Pharaohs. While the 12" EPs produced under the Kraft moniker tend to be lush, dancefloor-centric deep house and disco, his full-lengths are more experimental, incorporating acoustic guitars and drifting away from rhythmic structures. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Suzanne+Kraft">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
