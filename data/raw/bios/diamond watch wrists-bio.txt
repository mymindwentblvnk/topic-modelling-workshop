Diamond Watch Wrists is Guillermo Scott Herren and Zach HIll, flexing their combined musical muscles to create a brilliantly skewed vision of psychedelic folk music. Following their Warp Records debut "Ice Capped at Both Ends", DWW have been locked in endless rehearsals for their upcoming tour, as well as recording for a slew of forthcoming releases. The debut album is rife with startling melodic flourishes and unpredictable rhythmic twists, maintaining an incredible balance for two such busy musicians. Between their individual endeavors, including Prefuse 73, Hella, Savath & Savalas and many others, this pair is prepared for tirelessly pushing themselves beyond the normal limits of performing and touring. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Diamond+Watch+Wrists">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
