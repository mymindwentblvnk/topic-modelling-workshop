Die! Die! Die! is a punk three-piece from Dunedin, New Zealand, formed in late 2003 and formerly signed to Flying Nun Records.

Their self-titled album Die! Die! Die! was released in 2005 in New Zealand, with an international release soon after. It was recorded in Chicago's Electrical Audio by Steve Albini. 2006 then saw the release of the four-track EP Locust Weeks. This EP was included in the British release of the album, released by Pet Piranha Records.

The band's second album, Promises, Promises was released in New Zealand in October 2007, and worldwide shortly after. Produced by Straitjacket Fits' Shayne Carter, the album saw the band move away from the more hardcore tendencies of their first record towards a more bass- and drum-heavy sound, helped in part by new bassist Lachlan Anderson.

After touring relentlessly for almost three years worldwide, the band completed their third album Form in August 2009, which was released on Flying Nun Records in July 2010. Form debuted at number 1 on the independent charts and number 19 on the National Album charts. Produced by Nick Roughan, the album garnered critical acclaim as well as saw the band move further towards the sound they began on Promises, Promises. The bands fourth album, recorded in late 2010, is to be released in 2012.

All the band's releases prior to Form are available on American Label SAF Records.

Die! Die! Die! have toured with Franz Ferdinand, Wolfmother and The Blood Brothers, and have played several major festivals around the world including spots at SXSW. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Die%21+Die%21+Die%21">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
