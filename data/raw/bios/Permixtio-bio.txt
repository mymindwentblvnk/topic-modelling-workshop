Permixtio is pure Coldness and Grim Black Devotion!

Permixtio is reflective black metal performed with great passion. 
Having a grim & bleak approach on BM and a transcendent feeling in their music,
this band from Northern Italy plays very well-structured songs filled with feelings of melancholia, anguish and spiritual catharsis. 

The result is a desolate, grim, introspective & majestic BM with a sorrowful and almost ceremonious/religious aura. 

After many great demo tapes the 1st full length album (CD) is released in April 2010 under Sun & Moon Records
A tape version is also available from Valse Sinistre
