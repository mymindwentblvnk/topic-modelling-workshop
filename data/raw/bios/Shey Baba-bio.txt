In an age when music tends to feel rushed, shey baba is an anomaly – he takes his time. The Los Angeles born singer / songwriter / producer / multi instrumentalist decided to spend two years in relative isolation patiently making what would become his stunning debut album entitled Requiem.

Since releasing his first two tracks in late 2017 (“Requiem”) and early 2018 (“Vertigo”), shey has managed to rack up over 500,000 streams across Spotify & Apple Music, while becoming a mainstay in the KCRW rotation, all with absolutely no formal promotion. shey served as direct support to Susanne Sundfør on her North American and UK/European tours. He followed these support shows with an electrifying performance at Bonnaroo Music & Arts Festival and then played his first headline show in Los Angeles as apart of KCRW’s Summer Nights Concert Series at the end of June 2018. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/shey+baba">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
