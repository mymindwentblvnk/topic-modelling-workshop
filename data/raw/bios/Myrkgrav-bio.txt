Myrkgrav is a one-man folk metal project founded in 2003 by Lars Jensen in Norway. The band is heavily concept-based, with lyrical and visual themes rooted in folklore and local history from Lars' homelands, Ringerike and its surroundings.

Myrkgrav relies strongly on Norwegian folk music (including the use of traditional instruments) in its sound, while retaining a distinct extreme metal basis. What started out as a bedroom black metal project in 2003, has evolved to become a fusion of several different styles.
 
In addition to Lars Jensen himself, Myrkgrav often features guest members that add their own flare to the sound. As of today, the current recording line-up consists of the following individuals:
 
Lars Jensen: Vocals, guitars, flutes, keyboards and programming
Olav L. Mjelva: Hardanger fiddle
Erlend Antonsen: Bass guitar
