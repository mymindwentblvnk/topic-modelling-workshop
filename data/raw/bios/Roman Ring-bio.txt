Roman Ring was formed by members of Small Town Murder as the next step in an evolutionary process. An anomaly amongst the Chicago metal scene, Roman Ring fuses together elements rarely heard from their local peers. Combining blistering speed and technicality with passages of polyrhythmic grooves, their music will take you on a journey to another dimension before bringing you back to this world as a more evolved being.
