From the members of Just before Dawn comes death metal legion Gods Forsaken. Driven by the urge to play filthy old school Swedish death metal with no frills, the trio set out to record an album that takes the best parts of the late 80s, early 90s metal scene. The songs attracted record label Soulseller Records, who will release their full length debut “In a pitch black Grave” during 2017. Expect an arsenal of raw, buzzsaw driven death metal from members of bands like Blood Mortized, The Grotesquery and Wombbath.
