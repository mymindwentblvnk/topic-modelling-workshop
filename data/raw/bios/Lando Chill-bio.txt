"GREW UP IN A SINGLE PARENT HOME WITH 2 WOMEN, I WAS PRETTY LAME GROWING UP, STILL AM. GREW OUT MY HAIR DUE TO THE FACT THAT I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE COMBING IT OUT. I WEAR GLASSES NOT BY CHOICE. I COULD NEVER GET A GOVERNMENT JOB. MUSIC AND POETRY ARE THE BEST THING THATS EVER HAPPENED TO ME. LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT I CAN DO. "

- LANDO CHILL
 
The Chicago born & raised rap artist / songwriter Lando Chill has been making waves & turning heads in the deep Southwest, calling Tucson, Arizona his current musical home base of operation. Even whilst growing up in a choir & theatre orientated background due to his mother, music wasn't a prerogative until, by chance, he was cast in a University of Arizona Film School short in 2013 & tasked to lend his voice. From that point on, Lando has been on an enthralling journey through music, touring the country in 2015 & developing new records with his band, comprised of Chris "Deep Greasy" Pierce, Andy "Lasso" C, Jimmy "Jimbo"  Borquez, & Isaiah "Zayah" Briggs.  The blend of art and emotion puts them in a league with artists like Gil Scott Heron, J. Cole, and The Roots.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lando+Chill">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
