There are plenty of bands with the name Auschwitz.

One of the projects with this title was ran in Riga, Latvia, and had nothing to do with racial/ political subjects.
It was an industrial music formation with a core member Wilsons (keys, sampling, generators, vox) and other allies, mailny Melne (violin, keys) and Koils (guitar, keys, vox) in different it's periods. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Auschwitz">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
