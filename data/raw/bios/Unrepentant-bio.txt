Extreme one-man project from Amarillo, TX, USA

The intention with this project is to produce a progressive fusion of technical deathmetal and depressing/suicidal blackmetal with discordant/disharmonic jazz elements and manifest it at the edge of abstraction and absurdity...

Influences:

The influences that are brought to this project to manifest themselves are such topics as philosophy, metaphysics, wisdom, knowledge, hatred, bitterness, spite, violence, death, pain, suffering, despair, and ruin.

"Blackened Progressive Technical Deathmetal" is as specific as it can be described. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Unrepentant">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
