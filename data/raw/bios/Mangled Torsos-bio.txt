MANGLED TORSOS (Germany)
Olli (vocals / guitar), Frank (bass), Patrick (drums)
Formed in the summer of 1990, MANGLED TORSOS describe themselves as a very aggressive, fun Grindcore project and explained that the choice of band name highlighted this philosophy to the max.
1992 saw the recording of the group's first demo, 'Incalculate Of Your Subconscious', after which Frank replaced MANGLED TORSOS' original bassist.
In the spring of '93 the 2 track EP 'Anatomia Reformata' appeared as a limited edition of a mere 360 copies. Morbid Records promptly stepped in to sign the group.
In addition to the two albums released since 1994 ("Drawings of the Dead"'94, "Godless"'95), the band have supported the likes of DEAD, AGATHOCLES, MIASMA, BLOOD and PYOGENESIS. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mangled+Torsos">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
