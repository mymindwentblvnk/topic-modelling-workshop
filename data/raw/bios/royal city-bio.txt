Royal City were a Canadian Folk/Indie rock band. 

Originally from Guelph, Ontario, the band subsequently moved to Toronto, where their folk rock style made them one of the most popular bands on Canada's indie scene. 

Shortly after the release of Little Heart's Ease the band began an extended hiatus. Singer Aaron Riches currently lives in England pursuing a PhD in theology.

The band consisted of Aaron Riches, Lonnie James, Simon Osborne and Jim Guthrie. James replaced original drummer Nathan Lawr in 2002. 

So far they have made three albums - 

    * At Rush Hour the Cars (2000)
    * Alone at the Microphone (2001)
    * Little Heart's Ease (2004)
