Built from the only salvageable parts from multiple defunct bands in a garage on a dead end street full of hot rod parts and liquor stills, Thundering Herd are poised to bring the world a brand of hard rockin' metal that oozes 50 weight oil and reeks of white lightning. A three piece beast of blistering guitar, hammering drums, and pounding bass from the Bull City of Durham, North Carolina.
