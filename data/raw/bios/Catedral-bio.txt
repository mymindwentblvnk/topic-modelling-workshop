There are two South American bands that share the name Catedral, based in Brazil and in Colombia. 

The Brazilian band is a pop rock band founded in Rio de Janeiro in 1988. At first they were only into the gospel trend, being one of the most famous groups in its style. In 1999 the band decided to go mainstream and opened up for the rock genre. They quickly acquired many fans due to its vocal similarity to Renato Russo (famous legend of Brazilian pop rock). 

The Colombian band was an alternative project with Grunge influences signed to MTM Records and managed by Jose Gandour. The band was formed in late 1993 by Amos Pineros, (Voice and Violin), Tomas Rueda (Bass Guitar), Miguel Navas (Lead and Rhythm Guitar) and Andres Crump (Drums). They were very popular and influential in the underground rock music circuit of Bogota.

Pineros went to form Ultrageno later on, a band with a much heavier sound and even bigger success. Ultrágeno on Flickr 

Miguel Navas became a successful Electronic Music DJ, and Tomas Rueda is currently involved in other music projects and culinary arts. Andres Crump left music permanently.

The band is still considered very significant in the understanding of the Rock Music Scene in Bogota, Colombia.
