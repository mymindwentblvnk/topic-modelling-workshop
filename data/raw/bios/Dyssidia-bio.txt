Formed in 2010 by Jesse Olley, Corey Davis and Nathan Harvey, Dyssidia has been almost three years in the making before their first debut, with lots of writing and hard work to get to this stage. The trio worked well together and enjoyed jamming, but still lacked a singer and a bass player. When Neil Palmer joined the band in early 2011, it took the bands creativity and technicality to new heights. Another year went by of rehearsing and writing without a singer until Mitch Brackman joined in mid 2012 to once again bring the band to a new level, with his versatile vocal range and powerful screams.
