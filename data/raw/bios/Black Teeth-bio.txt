2. Black Teeth is an Indonesian punk supergroup that was formed in Jakarta by Neurotic guitarist Satriyo. The idea to form the band was founded by Satriyo who uploaded his song to SoundCloud in late 2013. At first it was a one-man project, but then drummer Eno Gitara and guitarist Christopher Bollemeyer from Netral joined the band. Later on, Jerry Killmore completes the line up as a bassist.

The first release by Black Teeth is a song called "Shit". "Shit" was released as a downloadable content on SoundCloud and a compilation by Racerkids Clothing called Racerkids Compilation #Volume 1.

As a new group, Black Teeth already became the most badass live band in 2014.

Trax magazine said with headlines "Aksi Perdana Black Teeth di Jakcloth, Liar!"

Early September 2014 Black Teeth already released their first album, distributed by Demajors Label.
