Tilt is a name used by more then one artist:  

1. Formed in the early-1990s, Tilt was a Berkeley, CA-based punk rock band known for their melodic songs featuring social commentary, dark humor and intelligent lyrics.  Fronted by husband-and wife team, vocalist/songwriter Cinder Block and guitarist Jeffery Bischoff with ex-Crimpshrine bassist Pete Rypins and drummer Vince Camacho, Tilt first released a successful demo that charted at local college station KALX for a month before recording their first 7" self-titled EP in January 1992. Tilt's full-length debut, Play Cell, came in 1993 on Lookout! Records and in 1995 the band released 'Til It Kills on Fat Wreck Chords with Gabe Meline on bass. The band briefly broke up in 1996, but rejoined the following year, this time with ex-Screw 32 member Jimmy Cheetah playing bass.  Collect 'Em All was released in 1998, followed by Viewers Like You was in 1999 with bassist Pete Rypins returning.   National tours with No Use for a Name and One Man Army followed. Tilt's 22-song B-sides and rarities compilation Been Where? Did What? surfaced in November 2001.  The band is currently broken up with no plans to reconvene in the future. In 2004, Cinder Block formed Retching Red with many of the members of Oppressed Logic. In the early years of their musical career, and while touring with Tilt, Cynthia & Jeffrey Bischoff co-founded a Bay Area music merchandising company (aptly named Cinder Block, Inc.), which has grown into an multi-million dollar international operation.


2. A Polish rock group, consisting of Tomasz Lipiński - g, voc; Franz Dreadhunter - bg, LaLa - g, kbd; Tomasz Czulak - dr. The band performed with breaks in the years 1979-2003.

On November 6, 2006, they released a new album, Vaults.
