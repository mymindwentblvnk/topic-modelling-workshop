Galathea (since 2006)
Moscow band playing in unusual style “aggressive metal”, includes rapid virtuosic solos, “angry“ riffs, bright twinkling of key’s symphony. All this blends with power of vocal and horror of brutal scream.
Galathea often appears on Moscow and Russia stages. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Galathea">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
