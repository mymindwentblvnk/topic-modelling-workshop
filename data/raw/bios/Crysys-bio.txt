1.) Heavy metal band from Portland, Oregon. 

The New Wave of British Heavy Metal swept over America like a wave in the early 1980s, and for every major market band like Quiet Riot or Motley Crue, there were literally dozens of lesser acts making waves out of smaller cities across the nation. Portland, Oregon's Crysys were one of them, and consisted of singer Stefan King, guitarist Tim Kasey, bassist Cary Ray and drummer Gene Kasey, who released their lone album, Hard as a Rock, independently in 1981. Unfortunately, the band may have actually arrived onto the scene a little too early, and with no major label backing to support them, sadly vanished from sight before the imminent market for American metal could develop.

2.) Thrash metal band from Barcelona, Spain.

Crysys is a thrash metal band from Barcelona (Spain). It was created at the beginning of 2008, using an old idea of Marc Torras (bass), he decided to bring the Shadon's guitar/voices, Javi Carrión, to take part of the band as a drums. Later, Marc Busqué and Albert Requena join the band as the guitars and together begin to create their own songs with only 16-18 years old. Few months later they propose the 21 years old, Julián Baz, to join as the singer of the band, the formation was already done and the band ready to thrash!
