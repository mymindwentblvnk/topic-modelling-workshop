Precision death/grind brutality built on blistering riffs, relentless vicious rhythms and inhuman vocals. Sons of Slaughter blend influences from old school death metal such as Suffocation and Morbid Angel and grind riffs inspired by Terrorizer and Napalm Death fused with the more contemporary speed and structure of bands like Dying Fetus and Cryptopsy.

Scotland's Sons Of Slaughter were formed in early 2003 with the members having all met through playing in local metal bands over the previous 5 years. They shared a common bond in the desire to create a more extreme metal sound than existed at that time in central Scotland. The band set to work quickly, writing material inspired by what they believed to be the most exciting sounds and using influences from old school death metal such as Suffocation and Morbid Angel and grind riffs inspired by Terrorizer and Napalm Death fused with the more contemporary speed and structure of bands like Dying Fetus and Cryptopsy. Having produced highly impressive promotional tracks in 2004, the band were signed by Retribute and went on to record their first album ''The Extermination Strain'' in 2005.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sons+Of+Slaughter">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
