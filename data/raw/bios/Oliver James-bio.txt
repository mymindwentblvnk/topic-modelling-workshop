Oliver James graduated from the Guilford School for Performing Arts in England and had only been working for a year before he snagged his role as Ian Wallace in What a Girl Wants. Oliver James' only real work before that had been in British commercials and stage productions.

After What a Girl Wants hit the big screen, everyone wanted to know who the British babe was that played Amanda Bynes' love interest, Ian Wallace. Lucky for Oliver fans, he is now starring in a new teen flick alongside Hilary Duff. Raise Your Voice hits theaters October 8, 2004 and Oliver plays the part of Jay, a cute musician that Hilary meets at a summer music camp.

Up until the moment he was cast as Amanda Bynes' love interest in What a Girl Wants, Oliver James was rehearsing with a British boyband. When Oliver James got the part of Ian Wallace, he left the unnamed group.

 Oliver James' own tunes appear on the What a Girl Wants Soundtrack.
