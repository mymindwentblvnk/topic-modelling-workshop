When the Empire Falls is a Finnish Melodic Heavy/Power Metal band formed in 2005.  Originally known as Empire Falls, changed name because there is an older band under that name in USA. Name was changed again from Empire Fails to When The Empire Falls because the previous name might be misleading for foreign fans.  In 2008 they released their first self titled album under the new name on Gagagoodies/Poko Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/When+The+Empire+Falls">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
