Nowadays, most bands seem to be quite content with simply copying their favorite metal / punk / alternative rock - combos, resulting in the fact that for every halfways original artist that ever walked the face of the planet there's now thousands of copycats sounding, looking and playing exactly the same.
One Past Zero's intention, however, is to create and perform HEAVY ROCK inspired by (but not lifted from) the true masters of the form such as Black Sabbath / Motörhead / Soundgarden / Slayer (to name just a few); avoiding all modern-day clichés as well as to follow any kind of 'retro-rock' - trend, delivering really powerful, heavy and original instead -
for all that may still care.
The band was formed in 2005 in Ulm, Germany, and plays with this lineup:
Gero - vocals
Uli H. - guitar
Mad - bass
Kischde - drums <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/one+past+zero">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
