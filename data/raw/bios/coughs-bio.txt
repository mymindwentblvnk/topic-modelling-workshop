Coughs broke up in November of 2006 after jamming together for nearly 6 years, playing their last show with the Slits in Chicago. All of its members went to form several other bands, some of which are still active. Anya (vox) and Carrie (bass) were in CACAW, Jail (keys/sax) performs solo as Forced into Femininity, Jon (drums) performs in Bomb Banks, and Seth (drums) is/was a member of Ga'an, Zath, Oakeater and has a solo project called Psychic Steel. Vanessa (guitar) is in a duo called Sister Fucker with Erin Allen (Child Pornography, Work, High Castle) . Maybe when they're old and have given up on life they will reunite and rekindle their post-adolescent angst to unleash upon the masses.
