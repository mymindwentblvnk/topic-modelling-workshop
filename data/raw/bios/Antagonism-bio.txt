Antagonism is a "urban" death metal band from central Italy, born from the ashes of Cancrena. The initial lineup, composed by Marco Vitali (guitar, bass, drum machine) and Marco Radossevich (vocals) record the EP “XXI Century” in 2006. The musical genre is a bright death metal, never noisy or confusing with clear political references in the lyrics, that talk about pollution, political corruption, criticism of contemporary society and its way of life. After the recording of the first demo Nicola parente (bass) and Giacomo Scattolini (drums) join the band and in 2007 Antagonism published “Extreme Metal Inside”, a 5 ways split with other bands of the Italian Death Metal scene. The split is well received by critics and it was promoted by a mini-tour that bring the bands to play in Italy. In the middle of 2007 Nicola left Antagonism and he’s replaced by Leonardo Ciccarelli which immediately integrates perfectly in the band. In 2010 the band publish the live DVD “Alive Death Spill”, and then began to work on the first full length:"Digging Past Sounds", published by SG Records in 2012. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Antagonism">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
