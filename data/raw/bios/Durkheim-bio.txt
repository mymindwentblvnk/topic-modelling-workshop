In February 2011 Kjetter and Nocturna started jamming together and writing songs, planning to found a new Band influenced by German Black Metal, DSBM and melodic norwegian Black Metal like Windir and Cor Scorpii.
In April/ May Fimbul joined them on the bass, followed by drummer Andor in June. Finally in July the four musicians decided to officially announce the birth of Durkheim progressing to complete their musical set.
In May 2013 Kjetter decided to step down as guitarist and focus on his vocals, giving room to former Before The Fall member Bane Sibinovic at the guitar.
In October the band signed a roster contract with the Viennese label Talheim recods, which released their first album Dehumanization in November 2014. 
In December 2015 Bane left the band. Katharsis of the band Morgengrau instead joined as live guitarist for the upcoming tour. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Durkheim">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
