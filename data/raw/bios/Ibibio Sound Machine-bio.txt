Fronted by British / Nigerian vocalist Eno Williams,  London based Ibibio Sound Machine combine elements of West African highlife, disco, post-punk & psychedelic electro soul. Folk stories, recounted to Eno by her family as a child in her mother's South-Eastern Nigerian Ibibio language form the creative lyrical fabric of their debut album that is due for release on Soundway Records late February 2014.

A unique sound born out of the mixed up nature of London today, Ibibio Sound Machine was started by producers Max Grunhard, Leon Brichard and Benji Bouton along with singer Eno. After first tracking all the bass and drum tracks they joined up with Ghanaian guitar legend Alfred 'Kari' Bannerman (who like Max Grunhard is from fellow Soundway signing Konkoma), before adding Brazilian Anselmo Netto on percussion and synth/horn men Tony Hayden & Scott Baylis to Eno Williams' lyrics. 

A dose of electronica with a forward-looking, refreshingly un-retro approach that's influenced by London as much as by West Africa, give the vocals and guitar lines space to breath without being overwhelmed. From the banging sub-bass of 'Lets Dance' to the spiritual, gospel-tinged notes of the album's opening track 'Voice of the Bird', the band have turned in a dynamic and, at times, beautiful take on modern afro-soul music.

A force of nature on stage, the 8-piece live band made their official live debut at this year's Transmusicales in France.

The full lineup of the band consists of Eno Williams (vocals), Alfred Bannerman (guitar), Anselmo Netto (percussion), Leon Brichard (bass/synth), Benji Bouton (drums/keyboards), Max Grunhard (alto sax), Tony Hayden (trombone/synth), Scott Baylis (trumpet) & Ben Hadwen (baritone sax).
