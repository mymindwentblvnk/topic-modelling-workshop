Toundra is a band from Madrid, Spain, formed in 2007 as a phoenix from the ashes of the recently-dissolved Nacen De Las Cenizas, which left a good taste in mouth among both national and international hardcore followers, despite the briefness of their existence. The new creature has decided to dispense vocals and provides us with an entirely instrumental sound where guitars, bass and drums take on the entire role.

After some demos, the quartet introduces itself with its first selftitled album, recorded Carlos Santos (ex-Terroristars) at Sandman Studios with production from Studio Tailor Maid in Sweden by the prestigious Peter in the Betou (Arch Enemy, Opeth etc.). Through the excellent work of both, the band has managed to create the suitable environment for the structures' development and the intensity of highs and lows that characterize the band.

At times it may recall as much to bands like Isis, Neurosis or Pelican to Scots Mogwai or even to the more progressive and less metal Tool, but never so much as to sound outdated and used. The comparison between their capabilities, sound, ideas, creativity and so on, of foreign and national bands, loses its relevance.
