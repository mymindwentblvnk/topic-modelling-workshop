Black Doom is not a pretentious revivalist doom fashion act. They dont think Doom is "cool" and neither should you. Ugly and discomforting, rather than formulaic, neutered and wrapped up in thrift store-smelling paisley. The aural equivalent of a possessed giant, on a malevolent, destructive trance. Mountains of bones, rivers of blood... No one can save you!  
"Cauldron of the Damned" is the title of the manifestation of the primitive, and a testament to desperation; a slow, and relentlessly hypnotic downward spiral of an album. The sweat-drenched ritual for "Cauldron of the Damned" was conducted by the unholy triarchy in its entirety, at the band's own altar. Ceremonial drums, and shamanic rites were captured on an 8-track live recording. Speak of evil and thou shall hear it. Listen to it, and thou shall see it...
