Grindmaster Dead was a doom/death metal band with folk elements from Riga, Latvia. They persisted from 1991 - 1995 when they changed their name to Skyforger, which is well-known Latvian folk/pagan metal band now.

Grindmaster Dead was founded in 1991, when guitarist Pēteris Kvetkovskis and drummer Imants Vovers left punk rock band Bez Greznības. Other members of band were Edgars Grabovskis (bass), Linda Bēce (flute) and Konstantīns Švedovs (vocals).

They have released one full-lenght album called Stronger Than Love in 1994. But there's also some other releases, like Through The Vaults Of Sadness (1993) and at least two more rehearsal recordings 1992-1994, and an unreleased demo tape, that was recorded around 1995 (when they renamed themselves Skyforger).

Now Grindmaster Dead exists no more, but follow-up of this band we can hear also today, when listening to Skyforger. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Grindmaster+Dead">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
