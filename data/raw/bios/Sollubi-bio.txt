SOLLUBI are a side project from the guys of FISTULA and RAPE X. They play a very original kind of gloomy, hypnotic, distorted and psychedelic sludge. You can find the downtempo and the heavy sound of FISTULA with a psychedelic and noisy vibe made by RAPE X. They sounds like «a tribute band of HAWKWIND made by -(16)-».

Its line-up gathers: 

Corey Bing - Drums (Bibilic Blood, Rue, Ultralord, Fistula, King Travolta, King Fire Goat, Son of Jor-El, Accept Death, Scumchrist)
Wizard (Scott Stearns) - Bass (Madman Mundt, Diehard, Wizardfool, King Travolta, Fistula, Son of Jor-El, Accept Death, Ultralord)
Jesse Kling - Vocals (Rape-X, Three Input Woman, Pennsylvania Connection)
Chris Griffith - Guitar (Rape-X, Pennsylvania Connection)
