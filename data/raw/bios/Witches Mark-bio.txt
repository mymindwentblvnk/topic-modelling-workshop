Witches Mark was cast in the unholy funeral fog circa Autumn 2005. A dark vision encompassing the purest remnants of true heavy metal, married unto trad, speed, power, death, black and doom bared witness to the mark of the witch. To journey along the path of the damned, the initial offering from Witches Mark was a praise to the dark lords of NWOBHM on the Unbroken Metal Records release "A Tribute To Angel Witch" where Witches Mark put forth their version of the Angel Witch classic "Something Wrong". The next order of action was to vanquish the unfaithful with the arrival of the highly acclaimed debut EP "A Grim Apparition" issued via Heaven and Hell Records in early 2009. Four songs of metallic might and a cover of "Solitude" by Swedish doom gods Candlemass served to better introduce Witches Mark to headbanger legions worldwide. A new tome to the undead will soon be revealed, heralding the return of a more lethal and lustful Witches Mark. Vacant stares and the echoes of your trembling bones has awakened this sleeping beast. As you cower at our feet, we will make you Slaves To Your Own Sin.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Witches+Mark">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
