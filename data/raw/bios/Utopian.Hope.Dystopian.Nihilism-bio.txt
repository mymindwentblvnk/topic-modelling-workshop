I'm not sure when did utopian.hope.dystopian.nihilism came to life, but i know that around mid-2004, i started working on some songs that were the foundations of this project. I had already been looking for musicians, but i wasn't lucky. In the meantime, in the summer of 2006, me and Bruno Pereira formed "Through Darkness". At that time utopian.hope.dystopian.nihilism was dead to me. Now, after some years of inactivity, for some unknown reason, i felt the need to finish what i've started.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/utopian.hope.dystopian.nihilism">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
