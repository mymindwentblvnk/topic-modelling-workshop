Surahn Sidhu lives in a perfect pop universe. He’s released underground disco hits under the name Sidwho?, performed as a member of retro-futurist indie-pop outfit Empire of the Sun, written mainstream hits for Usher, and now has a brilliant EP for DFA Records.

In keeping with this history of basically doing just about whatever he wants, Sidhu’s EP takes elements of all those pieces of himself, distills and filters it through a late 70s AOR R & B vibe that at times sounds like Player and Stevie Wonder with hints of ABBA and Alan Parsons Project...sometimes all at once.

Graced with a hand drawn cover by Surahn’s girlfriend and every instrument played and recorded by Sidhu, Surahn is an exquisitely personal and infinitely listenable deft 20 minutes of music.

The kind of album that makes a good gift, because it feels like one. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Surahn">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
