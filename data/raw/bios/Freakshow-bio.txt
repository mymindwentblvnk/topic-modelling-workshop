There are three bands with this name. One is a hard rock band, a Undergound Hip-Hop Group and a UK based unsigned Indie Rock band.

1. Freakshow features Frankie Banali of Quiet Riot, Markus Allen Christopher of Miss Crazy, Jeff La Bar of Cinderella, and Tony Franklin of The Firm and Blue Murder.

The debut release from Freakshow [Self Titled] showcases hi-octane powerful Hard Rock that blends the melodic sound of the 80s with a fresh punchy modern production that is sure to win over many fans worldwide. 


2. Even though Spetakkel received commercial success in the early 2000s, Bergen's hip-hop community didn't produce anything underground-credible until Freakshow released their debut mixtape "We are the champions" in 2004. The tape was in both English and Norwegian and had no guest appearances. The crew received the "Årets nykommer" (Rookie of the year) price at the Trondheim Norwegian Hiphop Awards for it. Back then, the group consisted of MCs LeeRoy, Ali Kazaam, Stiquo Suawe and Manu Argentina. The two latter later left the group to form Tiern & Lars, but Ali and LeeRoy still make music together in English under the same name.

3. Unsigned Indie/Rock band from the UK . They have been through various incarnations since 1991, 3 members of which are still in the band. Playing a blend of covers and original material. They are currently available for pub/venue bookings. A crunchy and heavy sound with a popular and funky vibe. http://www.freakshowuk.com/
