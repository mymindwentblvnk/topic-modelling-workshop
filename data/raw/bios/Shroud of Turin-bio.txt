Shroud of Turin, is a brutal Metal band out of CT, which is comprised of five men.

"I'll save my discussion of technical prowess for Southington's Shroud of Turin. Guitarists Scott Dobeck and Ryan Tufts write ridiculously precise songs. It's as though they took a standard Dillinger tune, doubled it in length, and grafted on melodies and breakdowns with enough ebb and tide to keep the attention of listeners and dancers alike. Behind them, Brian Kelly hits each drum like a lumberjack annihilating a forest. The Shroud struck a magnificent balance between musical marksmanship and logical, understandable songcraft. It was an incredible set by a band that has matured from a passable moshcore group into a tech-metal monster" - Hartford Advocate <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Shroud+of+Turin">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
