Implore came to life on the shape we know today in August 2013 when Daniel (guitars) and Gabbo Dubko (bass & vocals) united forces with Christian Bass (drums). 
After a quick chain of fortunate events the power trio rapidly started working hard on grindcore death metal songs encompassing different social issues on their lyrics. 
Six of the songs that form their live set will be released in April/May 2014 on 12" and therefore start playing gigs wherever possible. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Implore">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
