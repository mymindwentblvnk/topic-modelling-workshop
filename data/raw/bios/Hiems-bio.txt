Hiems (which means "winter" in Latin) is the solo project of Algol, bass player of the black/doom cult act Forgotten Tomb . Active from 1996 to 1999 and then on standby for 5 years, the Italian band finally released his first album "Cold Void Journey" in 2005. Worship or Die follows four years later, revealing a new musical shape, less close to standard black metal and showing a rock and groovy approach. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hiems">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
