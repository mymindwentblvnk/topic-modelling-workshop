Vinterbris is a quite new metal band, formed in the year of 2008 in Bergen, Norway. Since then, the band has been through some line-up changes, one web-based EP and the longest recording period since the dawn of day. 

Now, though, the debut is finished, and the record is just how they want it to be. Playing their own form of melodic black metal, Vinterbris is ready to take the world by the balls and give Norwegian metal a new face.  

The band consists of Henrik Skar, the main composer, vocalist and guitarist, Richard H. Dahle (guitarist) of Fjordfader, Kenneth Langedal (bass) & Ivan Rolstad (drums) of Neoplasma. The debut was recorded in their friend Kristoffer Aalhus' studio (Fjordfader, Putrid), which also was the producer and engineer. Later it was mixed by Tor Vegard Aksnes, whom also worked as a co-producer.
