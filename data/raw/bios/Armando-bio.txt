Armando Gallop (sometimes written as Armando Gallup) (February 12, 1970, Chicagoâ€“December 17, 1996), who released material under his first name only, was an American house-music producer and DJ who was an early contributor to the development of acid house.

Armando was born in Chicago to parents of Afro-Cuban descent. He was a star baseball player as a youngster before spinal meningitis put an end to his athletic aspirations. He became interested in dance music, organizing parties by age 16 and mixing on radio by age 17. He and Mike Dunn founded Warehouse Records in 1988, where he released the singles "151" and "Land of Confusion," the latter of which became a club hit in Chicago as well as in Britain, where it influenced their early acid-house scene. He also produced Warehouse releases from Ron Trent, DJ Rush, and Robert Armani.

Instead of working on production, Armando spent most of the early 1990s with a residency at Chicago's Warehouse from 1992 to 1994. He served as an A&R rep for Felix da Housecat's Radikal Fear label and, soon, after recorded for that label himself. His first full-length album, One World, One Future, was released in 1996 on Play it Again, Sam, but he died of leukemia later that year. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Armando">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
