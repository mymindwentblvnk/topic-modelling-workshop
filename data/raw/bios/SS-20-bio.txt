VOXX 032) rare early BOMP release nearly out out print, Put together Bruce Wagner, an amazingly nuanced guitarist terminally influenced by '60s psychedelic rock, with Madeline Ridley, a goth queen who prayed to Jim Morrison and Syd Barrett almost as often as she slit her own wrists, throw in ace drummer David Winogrond (Skooshny, Davie Allen, Sylvia Juncosa) and ace producer Gary Stern, add astonishing cover versions of "My Eyes Have Seen You" (Doors), "Penetration" (Stooges) and a brace of vampiric originals, and you have this sleeping gem of an album. Fantastic instrumental improvisation nailed to a mesmerizingly gloomy vocal presence makes for an album that, if you haven't heard it, you really should be asking yourself why... [6/86] Greg Shaw
