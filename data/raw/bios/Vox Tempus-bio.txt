The members of Vox Tempus first came together in January of 1997, as members of the progressive rock band Equinox. The band was in the midst of promoting their successful worldwide debut, COLOR OF THE TIME, which had reached the top 20 in Europe and Japan, and received airplay in over 40 countries. During recording sessions for a follow-up release, the lineup splintered and Ray Mantor (guitars) and Jim Turba (bass) continued writing songs with their drummer as a trio. For the time being, the band continued on as Equinox.

In 1998 the band was introduced to Eric Ragno, a keyboard player in Los Angeles. Eric has played with many of hard rock's musical legends, and was finishing up an album with Takara when he heard that the band was searching for a keyboard player for their upcoming album.  Eric's musical contributions served to solidify the bandâ€™s new sound.

As the songs were written and recorded for the new album, the band went through several vocalists.  After going through over a hundred submissions from throughout North America, the group finally settled on Dan Reed. His voice is colored with many different influences - though he truly has a unique sound that's all his own.

As mixing began on the new album, the drummer chose to move on.  With this latest change in personnel and a more guitar-oriented approach to their music, the band changed their name to Vox Tempus.   The legendary Gregg Bissonette was brought in to record new drum tracks, and a title was chosen - In the Eye of Time.  The album debuted at the 2004 ProgPower festival, and continues to generate rave reviews from around the world.  The album features Ray Mantor (guitar), Jim Turba (bass), Eric Ragno (keyboards), Dan Reed (vocals), and special guest Gregg Bissonette (drums). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vox+Tempus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
