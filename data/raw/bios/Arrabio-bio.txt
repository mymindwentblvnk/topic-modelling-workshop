Arrabio hail from Trinidad, Cuba. After years in isolation the band has distilled its unique sound, carving their spot in the international hardcore community. It was once illegal in Cuba to play rock'n'roll, now this 4-piece has been at the forefront of creating a DIY rock'n'roll revolution in Cuba, a country hungry for something new.
