Harry Moses Simeone (Newark, New Jersey, May 9, 1911 - February 22, 2005, New York City, United States) was a distinguished arranger, conductor and composer, best known for arranging the classic Christmas song The Little Drummer Boy, for which he received co-writing credit.

Sparked by his childhood passion for the Metropolitan Opera, Simeone sought a career as a concert pianist and eventually attended the Juilliard School of Music for three years before leaving to take work at CBS as an arranger for bandleader Fred Waring. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Harry+Simeone+Chorale">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
