The Wreckage is a hard rock project formed in late 2010 by five Omaha music scene standouts. They come from other musical ventures that would be considered staples of the music community and even with their extensive experience, are looking to take themselves to the next level. Their music consists of many influences, from pop/rock to metal. Catchy vocal hooks, crushing guitar riffs, and searing solo leads, as well as a high energy stage presence are all included and will leave you speechless after you witness their live performance. As of now, they are in the final stages of recording their debut, self-titled EP. Look for it to be released Summer 2011, but for now, check out a live show and their first single, Breaking Through, to see what the buzz is all about. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Wreckage">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
