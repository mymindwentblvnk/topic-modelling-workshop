Uhrilehto was a Finnish Melodic Black Metal - founded in 1996. After some changes in the line-up, Nidhogg (vocals, guitar) is the only original member remaining. The sound combines Dark Metal and Atmospheric Black Metal styles of Finland but, with Melody to capture a very Melodic Black taste.

Despite these circumstances, the band recorded four demos, the debut album Viha Ja Ikuinen Vitutus and - after having changed to the German label Schwarzdorn Production - the albums Vitutus Millennium and Viimeinen Vitutus.

In 2004, Cyclotron joined the band playing drums from now on, and the horde entered Watercastle Studio in Finland to record the fourth album Ihmisvihan Eliitti in 2005, again signed to Schwarzdorn Production. 

The current line up is:
- Nidhogg - vocals, vuitar
- Noirgrim - vocals, guitar
- Essiah - bass
- Cyclotron - drums <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Uhrilehto">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
