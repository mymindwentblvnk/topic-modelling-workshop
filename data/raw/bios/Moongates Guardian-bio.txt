Moongates Guardian is a studio project from Kaliningrad, Russia. The band was formed in 2013 by the members of Regnat Horrendum. 

The musicians confidently combine orchestrations, ambient inserts, medieval melodies, folk tunes and other elements untypical for standard black metal. The lyrics created by Moongates Guardian are based on the works of J. R. R. Tolkien both on the source language and translated into Russian. MOONGATES GUARDIAN attracts listeners with its unique atmosphere and flavor, welcomes them to the enchanted world of the Middle-earth, the ancient times of elves, dwarfs, halflings, orcs and other fictitious creatures.
