My Latest Novel are a Scottish five-piece band from the west coast town of  Greenock. The Members are Chris Deveney (vocals, guitar, bass), his brother Gary Deveney (vocals, guitar), Paul McGeachy (guitar, xylophone, vocals), Ryan King (drums) and Laura McFarlane (vocals, violin, piano).

The musical style of the band is somewhere between indie rock and folk pop.

Their first EP "Sister Sneaker Sister Soul" was released in 2005 and their debut album "Wolves" was released in March 2006.

My Latest Novel's songs are often complemented by violins, xylophones and undulating percussion. They have been described as "Bohemian harbingers of breezy folk melodies and brilliant pop theatrics ... rapidly winning fans on both sides of the border with effervescent, magical music."

Having played just a handful of gigs in their native Scotland, My Latest Novel secured a slot at Manchester’s In The City music convention in 2005 and the band have not looked back. In the eight months following In The City the band recorded sessions for XFM, supported Smog, British Sea Power and The Dears, and recently signed a deal with Bella Union records.

Sister Sneaker Sister Soul is the band’s  debut single, a heart-rending love song with the B-side "The Not So Reverend".

2006 saw My Latest Novel play The Green Man Festival, T in the Park and a special support slot with The Pixies in Edinburgh.

The long awaited second album "Deaths & Entrances" is due for release on 18th May 2009 on Bella Union Records . <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/My+Latest+Novel">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
