Danny Goo is a rising star amidst a new generation of indie artists who transcend genre. His charming vocals blend plainspoken emotional vulnerability with intimate minimalist pop and soothing postmodern R&B. There’s something both otherworldly and immediately relatable about the atmosphere the Dallas, Texas native conjures. Central Track wrote that DANNY’s music “possesses the earmarks of alternative R&B while embodying a nexus of emo, cloud rap, and dream pop.” DANNY’s Feel For You is a six-song confessional detailing the rise and fall of a romantic relationship. Produced by longtime collaborator JoJo Centineo, the EP is a dreamy mishmash of classic pop-rock and neo-soul. Listeners who discovered Danny via SoundCloud, Emo Nite, and on bills with Emotional Xan, Boyfriendz, and Sleye are the same dedicated listeners drawn to artists like Lil Lotus (who guests on “So In Love”). The energy of Warped Tour, the passion of pop punk, and the confessional balladry of R&B are all here. Seamlessly blending seemingly disparate genres into a smooth and broad reaching sound that’s as vibrant and dynamic as it is unique, DANNY GOO is on a simple mission to spread peace, love and positivity. Take a seat, take a sip, and take it in. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Danny+Goo">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
