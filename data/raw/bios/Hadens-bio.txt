Hadens is a band from Bergen, Norway, and plays some sort of Black Metal.
Band uses a variety of tempos, from a slower style to the well known blast beats of the genre. 
The musical style has a sense of a cold, powerful grimness to it.

Founded in 2010, the band has been through numerous changes in the line up. 
They now consist of Frederic Nielsen, Tore Henrik Jacobsen, Anders St√∏len, and William Heggem.
Henrik Skar from Vinterbris contributed with playing guitar on the record, and did some vocals on the Witchcult track, which he also wrote the lyrics for.
