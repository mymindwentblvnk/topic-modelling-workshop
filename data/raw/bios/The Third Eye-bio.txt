There are three bands known as The Third Eye

1. From the legendary hard rocking South African psych rock scene, alongside such greats as Freedomâ€™s Children, and Suck, comes The Third Eye. 

Heavy psych, featuring fuzzed out guitars, great brass arrangements and virtuosic organ work, provided by the young Dawn Selby, who, at the time of recording ( album: Awakening )was all of 14 years old! 

2. A progressive rock group formed in Durban in 1968

3. Taken from their MySpace: "The Third Eye is one of the most eclectic bands around. Taking influence from Progressive Rock, Metal, Drum and Bass and Jazz to name but a few. This band aims to push boundaries and not fall into the trap of mediocrity and unoriginality. They are constantly exploring new directions, marking a stark contrast from the majority of mainstream music by pushing themselves to create something truly different.

For any of you interested to learn about the story of the first album (as it stands now), don't hesitate to contact the band." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Third+Eye">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
