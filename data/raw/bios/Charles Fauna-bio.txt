Sinking feelings, surging hooks, sparse moments that haunt and swell to impossibly lush soundscapes. For Charles Fauna, opposites attract, and it is somewhere in between the magnetic pull of dark and light where his unique brand of alternative pop makes its home. The Los Angeles / Brooklyn-based artist, producer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist achieves his characteristically sprawling sound almost entirely on his own, all from within the confines of his bedroom studio.

At 18 he moved to New York to attend NYU, his music relegated to his dorm room, where he would record demos in private. After graduation, he found himself surrounded by a tight-knit community of musicians in Brooklyn, and finally decided it was time to release his own music.

The teenage Charles Fauna would hardly recognize the artist he is today. His music has garnered millions of streams, praise from a number of press outlets including Billboard, Noisey, Earmilk, and NYLON, and a stint at SXSW. The honesty that once unnerved him has become the driving force behind his songwriting. And the heights that once seemed out of reach for the budding artist are firmly within his grasp. Now, with his upcoming new EP, Fauna is ushering his most personal collection of songs to date into the world. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Charles+Fauna">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
