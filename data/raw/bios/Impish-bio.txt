2. Impish (Finland)
It all began when Raappana joined forces with Mythos in 2000. That was the moment when the drumming of Raappana and Hiltunen’s guitar work started to form the foundation on which Impish was later built on.

Despite numerous changes in line-up and band names (previous incarnations have included Synthetic Soul and Mogulos, among others), Hiltunen and Raappana have continued to play together.

The next step towards perfection was when Karhu joined the band as a guitar player in 2003. After trying out several singers it was decided that Karhu was definitely the best option to handle vocal duties as well.

The circle was completed on 29.2.2004. After others had tried, Jääskelä took charge of the lower frequencies on bass.

After about nine months of pregnancy Impish went into labour to create the 5 song demo.

The road ahead is clear. We will continue to pursue our ideal of perfect music, which will include twisted rhythm variations, ballbreaking rhythm guitars and intricate melodies.
