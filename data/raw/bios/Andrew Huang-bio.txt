Andrew Huang is a Toronto-based new media artist whose work is a distillation of his passion for music, video, social media and audience engagement.
 
A versatile composer, he is unable to be pinned down to any one genre of music. As a producer he has created work for companies such as WWF, US Bank and the Royal Winnipeg Ballet; as a songwriter and performer he has toured 6 countries. Last fall he worked with Emily Haines of Metric to create a music and video installation piece at The Four Seasons Centre in Toronto. 
 
Huang developed a near-cult following in his early twenties as the creative force behind Songs To Wear Pants To, an online musical comedy project that invites anyone to send him instructions for songs - of which he's created over 600 since 2004.
 
More recently he has become a well-known YouTube personality, his self-produced content and grassroots approach garnering him over 6 million views in the past year alone. With more by-request musical exploits, dialogues created from user submissions, and eccentric, time-intense pieces - watch him create a beat with 1000 pairs of jeans! - his work continues to hit a sweet spot between sound, picture and audience interaction. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Andrew+Huang">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
