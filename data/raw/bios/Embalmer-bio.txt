EMBALMER was formed in 1989 and came out puking out gore and pure brutality. The first demo, Into The Oven was released in 1991 with original bassist/vocalist Toby Wulff. Toby soon left the band and was replaced by vocalist Rick Fleming. This lineup released the second demo, Rotting Remains in 1993, which sealed their domination of the early/mid 90's Cleveland Death Metal scene. EMBALMER then recorded the now legendary There Was Blood Everywhere 7", which was released in 1995 by Relapse Records and then re-released on CD with the four songs from the Rotting Remains demo in 1997. Unfortunately, the band broke up later that year leaving much unreleased material and many disappointed fans. Now it's 2005 and EMBALMER is back, better, gorier, sicker and more brutal than ever with original drummer Roy Stewart, Rick Fleming on Lead vocals, Don Wolff on Lead Guitar, Duane Morris on Guitar and Rob Lesniak on Bass. EMBALMER have finally put out a new and long overdue release entitled 13 FACES OF DEATH, which was produced by lead vocalist Rick Fleming, combining a few re-recorded classics and some brand news songs guaranteed to peel back your fucking face. EMBALMER would like to thank all the people that have supported us back then and those who still support the band now, as well as new fans who are hearing this band for the first time.
