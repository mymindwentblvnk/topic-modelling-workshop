Tyrann is a Norwegian black metal band.

Tyrann first saw the darkness as a side project of Draugluin in early 2002. Quickly consumed by the fire of Tsjuder, it took its first death in 2003. Unfortunately, the beast refused to die properly. Evidence suggests that Tyrann was re-spawned in 2006 and now consists of the überbastards Antichristian (ex-Tsjuder), Seidemann (1349) and Draugluin (ex-Tsjuder). Their first album “Shadows of Leng” was recorded during summer 2007 and is scheduled for release on Dark Essence/Karisma records in early 2009. Tyrann is highly nauseating, offensively necrotic and clinically mentally destructive. Their music will do you no good and should be avoided at all costs. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tyrann">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
