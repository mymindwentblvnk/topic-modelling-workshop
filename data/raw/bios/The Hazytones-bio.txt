The Hazytones is a group of stoner rock founded in 2015 in Montreal. The trio stuns the audience with his stage presence and intensity. Riff after riff, the group is known for his fat sound and heavy destructive saturation.

In September 2015, The Hazytones began the production of their debut album with originals member, Mick Martel, Frédéric Couture and Antoine St-Germain. Recorded and mixed at ReelRoad studio located in Rosemont – La Petite-Partie in Montreal. After a few month of labor, the band launched his first single ‘’Living On The Edge’’, followed by a music video. To mark the imminent release of their first titled album, the trio got on the road across Canada(23 shows) from August to September 2016.

The band launched their first titled album on September 22nd at La Rockette bar in Montreal at the Pop Montreal festival. The album was well received by the stoner/psychedelic community in Canada, USA and Europe.

More recently, the band toured Europe (UK, Belgium, Switzerland and France) for 28 days and 10 days after they embarked on a Canadian tour that led them all the way to Vancouver and back. They have also just toured the United States, playing 45 shows in 47 days, a tour that led them all the way to California!

Coming back from tour Frey Coaster parted ways with the band to pursue his career. The Hazytones luckily found Adam Gilbert to join the band on bass and back vocals. 

For the Hazytones future, more touring probably in Europe and a new album. The band has been signed to two labels, Ripple Music and Kozmik Artifacts. Both labels will produce Cd, Vinyls and handle the digital distribution.
