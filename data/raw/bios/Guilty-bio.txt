b.) When they released their debut EP, “Everybody’s Watching”, they couldn’t have been closer to the truth. Since late 2000, Guilty has been a driving presence in the 905 music scene. Starting simply as founding members Brad Vanderwoerd and Josh Vanderlaan with a guitar and a set of drums, Guilty has since risen to a certain level of celebrity within Hamilton rock. In 2005, while recording their EP at Hamilton’s Mastermind studio, Brad and Josh met and recorded with future bandmate, guitarist Dave Wilson. What originally began as a professional relationship with Guilty quickly grew. Dave was used as a fill-in for the band a handful of times and was eventually brought on full time as a full fledged member of the band. Soon after Dave’s arrival in the band, another piece of the Guilty puzzle was added. Jeff Baadsvik was added to pick up bass duties and the quartet carried on with rigorous local gigging. After months of playing tons of venues throughout Southern Ontario, it was time to head back into the studio. On the agenda this time was a full length Album.
