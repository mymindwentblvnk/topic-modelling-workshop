.. Formed in August of 2005, in the bowels of southern Kentucky, The band is now evolving into the sickeningly horrific sound that we had envisioned. Every member of the band has various musical backgrounds and some are from bands of yesterday, but all have one thing in common, HATE. Hate, aggression, anger, disappointment, violence are all things that fuel this band. We'll take you through a gauntlet of pain, with furious blasting, brutal grinding and disharmonic melodies. When asked to describe ourselves we can only say we ride on the shoulders of our forefathers in this genre. We consider ourselves to be a giant fuck you to all the other forms of popular music and the trends that come and go. We refuse to fall into the emo, screamo shit, that is third generation rip offs of what hardcore is. We all agree it’s great that death metal is getting some well deserved notoriety in the main stream now, but that has no affect on us. It could become unpopular again tomorrow and we would still be playing the music that comes most natural to us. We have tried to take the aspects of death, grind & black metal also with some ambient and other ideas that appeal the most to us and turn out music that would make you want nothing more than to beat someone to the sounds of our chaos and rage. Life and what happens in the world around us reflect what we are about, our song topics are the truth, no sugar coated fantasies. We will continue to push ourselves to create heavier, more brutal and even more unforgettable songs. This band was founded by people who live metal, and have every intention of doing as long as they can. This is all we know and who we are. If you don’t know us yet you will. Let our hate, be our gift to you! .... HAIL THE UNDERGROUND! ...... <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Scars+of+Suffering">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
