Invalids began in 2008 as a solo project of Pete Davis with remote help from other musicians over the internet.  Up until 2014, Nick Shaw of Black Crown Initiate performed bass for all recordings.  In 2015, Pete joined up with drummer Joe Scala of The Best of the Worst, bassist Raymond Bonanno of Use Big Words, and guitarist Brock Benzel of Panucci's Pizza to form a full live band.  They are localized in New Brunswick, NJ. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Invalids">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
