Another black metal project by Puissance's Fredrik Söderlund, formed in 1995 in his hometown Linköping, Sweden. Parnassus differed from his other black metal project Octinomos by being exlusively a solo project and having a more symphonic, here meaning keyboard-driven, approach.

Parnassus released two demo tapes in 1995, the debut album In Doloriam Gloria in the same year and another, so far also final, album Let the Stars Fall and the Kingdom Come in 1997. Both albums were released on the Swedish underground label Secula Delenda. It seems like around 1997 Söderlund got too busy to maintain his various projects and among others Parnassus was buried, apparently for good.
