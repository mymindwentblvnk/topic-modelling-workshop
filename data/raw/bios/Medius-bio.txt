Medius started in San Diego, CA and has gone on to become one of the heaviest and most unrelenting bands in the country. Medius has performed with dozens of national acts, performed on television, radio, and more. 
Since finalizing their line-up in 2011, they have shared the stage with Powerman 5000, Obituary, Green Jelly (Jell-O), Prong, Full Blown Chaos, Exodus, Hemlock, and performed at private parties for the Metal Mulisha. 
Medius will be releasing their first full length album titled “Burns Going Down” SPRING 2012 and are in the middle of planning a national US tour to follow the release. 
Medius’ Philosophy: 
“We love to make heavy music, we love to have fun, and we aren’t pretentious. Our mission is to share it with as many people as possible and have a great time along the way.” <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Medius">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
