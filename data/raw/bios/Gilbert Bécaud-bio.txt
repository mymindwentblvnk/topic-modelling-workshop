Gilbert Bécaud (born François Gilbert Léopold Silly in Toulon, France on 24 October 1927 – died on 18 December 2001) was a French singer, composer and actor, known as Monsieur 100,000 Volts for his energetic performances. His best-known hits are probably Nathalie and Et Maintenant, a 1961 release that became an English language hit after being translated into "What Now My Love?".

He began songwriting in 1948, after meeting Maurice Vidalin, who inspired him to write his early compositions. He began writing for Marie Bizet; Bizet, Bécaud and Vidalin became a successful trio, and their partnership lasted until 1950. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Gilbert+B%C3%A9caud">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
