- DEATH METAL DARKNESS -

INFINITUM OBSCURE was founded in 2000 by Roberto Lizárraga with the sole purpose of expressing a personal vision of Death and existence in the form of obscure Death Metal.

The band has released 1 split (on CD and 10 inch mini LP formats), 2 full length albums (on CD and LP formats), one 7 inch EP, and 2 demos (one on Cassette and one on CDR), between 2003 and 2009 and are currently working on their 3rd full length album...

Their last album entitled "Sub Atris Caelis" (released in 2009) was produced by the legendary Bill Metoyer and mastered at the reknown Necromorbus Studio in Stockholm, Sweden, rendered by the artwork of the infamous Ketolahelvete.

INFINITUM OBSCURE recently toured the United States of America in support of Sweden's own NOMINON, in June/July of 2010.

Other smaller tours have included 2 Mexican tours (2006 with BELPHEGOR and 2007 with WATAIN), a West Coast USA mini tour (2006 with DESTRÖYER 666), 3 date mini USA tour (2010 with DEFILED), a Mid West USA mini tour (2003 with THE CHASM and OBEISANCE) as well as a 2 date mini tour in their home state of Baja California (2002 with ANGELES DEL INFIERNO).
