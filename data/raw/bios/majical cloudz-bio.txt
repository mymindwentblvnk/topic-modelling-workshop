Majical Cloudz wasmusic and performance. Rooted in solo material written by Devon Welsh between rural Ontario and Montreal, he joined with Matthew Otto in February 2012 to collaboratively produce and perform the music.
Their performance was deeply expressive â€” strong vocals sat on top of washes of white noise, filtered synths and sparse thuds. The songs were intensely lyrical, oriented around themes of death, patience, family, and desire. The live show celebrated the joy in sadness and the value of a shared musical experience.
On March 4, 2016 the duo announced on their tumblr page that they were going their separate ways and that "Are You Alone?" would be their last full release. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Majical+Cloudz">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
