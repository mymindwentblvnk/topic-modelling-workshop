These Kids grew up in different parts of the world, but in 2009 they were suddenly within music playing distance. So they started a band together. They enjoyed it and played it more. Everyone got along well! It was fantastic! And so was the music! Then BOOM! They made an EP. And now they are still doing it like they do. Get your dance shoes. The ride has started.

These Kids have been very busy lately!  They have a new member of the band named Joshua Mcdaniel. These Kids call him Gypsy Josh, not to be confused with Josh Mitchinson. After filming with Much Music for DisBAND, they will be recording another EP in Dallas Texas with manager Jonathan Cook of Forever the Sickest Kids. Following recording These Kids Wear Crowns plan to have one more tour in Canada during the summer, then will be touring with Forever the Sickest Kids in the United States! About that blowing up in the face of music....Get ready world here comes THESE KIDS! :)
