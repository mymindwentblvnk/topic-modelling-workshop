STRIDSMENN is the union between BORGARHOLT & AUSTKRIGAR, two bands formed by Arnjeir.

BORGARHOLT was formed in winter 2003 in order to pay tribute to Arnjeirs Norwegian ancestors and to the great art of Norwegian Black Metal. His music, while being deeply rooted in the traditional Norwegian scene, also shows it's own personality based on Norwegian folklore and melancholy.

During 2003-2005 BORGARHOLT released three demos, all of which were available in very limited quantities and only given to friends.

In 2005, AUSTKRIGAR was formed because Arnjeir wanted to compose music that was somewhat different from BORGARHOLT while at the same time he was working on the debut album of BORGARHOLT. Thus the AUSTRKRIGAR 3-track demo was created.

Early in 2006, Arnjeir started composing the material that would later become the debut album of STRIDSMENN. After three years of recording, re-recording and mixing, the album was finally ready and Arnjeir decided to merge his two projects BORGARHOLT & AUSTKRIGAR together into one - STRIDSMENN. A decision that had to be made in order to gain more compositional freedom and reach a higher standard with his art.

Since then, Arnjeir has been recruiting members in order to form STRIDSMENN into a full band. They are already working on the material for their second album and are currently sorting out the line-up for possible live shows.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Stridsmenn">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
