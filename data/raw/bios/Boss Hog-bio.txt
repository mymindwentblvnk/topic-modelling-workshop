Boss Hog is an American alternative rock band, formed in 1989 in New York City, New York. The band faded into inactivity and its last known year as a band was 2001. Their lineup including the husband and wife duo of Jon Spencer (guitar) and Cristina Martinez (vocals), both formerly of the band Pussy Galore, along with Jens Jurgensen (bass), Hollis Queens (drums) and Mark Boyce (keyboard). Spencer's other bands are Heavy Trash,  and the Blues Explosion, which existed in parallel to Boss Hog.

Their band name derives from a slang term amongst bikers for a desirable ("boss") motorcycle ("hog"). The band achieved some notoriety, not only due to their punk and blues influenced sound, but moreso because of Martinez's use of full nudity on the band's debut live performance and record sleeves. A music video was also made in the mid-'90s for the song "I Dig You." Their releases are relatively sporadic, but comprised three full length albums, a mini-album, an EP and a number of singles in an 11 year history. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Boss+Hog">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
