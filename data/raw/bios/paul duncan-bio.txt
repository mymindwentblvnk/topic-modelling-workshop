Paul Duncan (*1979) is an American Singer / Songwriter. Born in East Texas and since then moved to Savannah and Brooklyn, respectively, he began as one man composing in a homemade studio. He combined traditional, almost country-oriented instruments (guitar, pedal steel, drums, banjo, strings, glockenspiel, piano, etc.), synthesis and noise to create tricky pop songs and musical descriptions of memories. His first album, To An Ambient Hollywood, was released by Hometapes in 2003 and his second, Be Careful What You Call Home in 2005. He recorded his third album Above the Trees (2007) in Chicago with engineer Tim Iseler. The record features performances by Adam Wills (Rhys+Chatham's+Essentialist, Bear In Heaven), Christopher Bear (Grizzly Bear), David Daniell (San Agustin, Rhys+Chatham's+Essentialist), Douglas McCombs (Tortoise, Brokeback), Fred Lonberg-Holm (Terminal 4, Lightbox Orchestra), Joe Stickney (Rhys+Chatham's+Essentialist, Bear in Heaven), Josh Berman (Exploding Star Orchestra), Ken Champion (Jim Oâ€™Rourke), Nate Lepine (Cursive, Smog), Nate Swanson, and Tim Daisy (The Vandermark 5). 

In addition to his own music, Paul Duncan is cultivating a presence as an engineer/producer in his own studio. He plays live with Jonathan Kane and recently recorded Kane's new EP on Table of the Elements. He worked on a live CD release on the Antiopic label featuring Oren Ambarchi, Alan Licht and Tetuzi Akiyama. Friend and collaborator David Daniell had Paul at work on his new record, also released on Antiopic. In addition, Paul appeared on (and did some engineering on) Bear in Heaven's latest record (their last was on Eastern Developments).
