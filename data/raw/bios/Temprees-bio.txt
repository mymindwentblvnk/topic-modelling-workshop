The Temprees (also known as the Temprees), were an American soul vocal trio from Memphis, Tennessee, most popular during the 1970's. The band released several albums under We Produce records, an offshoot of Stax Records. In 1972, the band performed in front of over 100,000 fans at the famous Wattstax festival in Los Angeles.

Originally formed as The Lovemen, the trio - Jasper "Jabbo" Phillips, Harold "Scotty" Scott and Deljuan "Del" Calvin - met in the mid-1960's, when they were in junior high school [1], along with Jimmy Dodson, future lead singer of the Bar-Kays. First signed to Stax Records in 1970, and later to Epic Records (a subsidiary of CBS), the band released four albums, Lovemen, 1974's Love Maze, Because We Love You, and 1972's Dedicated To The One I Love. Their catalog was later re-released on CD[2][3] [4], along with a greatest hits compilation entitled, The Best of the Temprees[5]. The trio's last hit was 1976's "I Found Love On A Disco Floor"[6].

The band reunited in the 1990's. Lead singer Jasper "Jabbo" Phillips died on February 21, 2001[7]. The Temprees' rendition of "Dedicated To The One I Love" was one of 50 songs featured in the 2-CD box set Stax 50th Anniversary Celebration in 2007.[8] <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Temprees">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
