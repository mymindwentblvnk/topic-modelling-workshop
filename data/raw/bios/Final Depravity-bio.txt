FINAL DEPRAVITY is a young and aspiring thrash metal quartet hailing from the Ruhr area (Gelsenkirchen, NRW) of Germany. Known as the homebase of legends like Sodom and Kreator and most vital center of today's German metal scene.

Founded in December 2007, the band came up with a highly praised 3-track demo in 2008 and shared stages with renowned acts like Sodom, Legion Of The Damned, Artillery, Mystic Prophecy and The Very End since then. 

The track "Veil Of Secrecy" has been made available for free downloading all over the web in September 2010. Taken from the debut album "Nightmare 13" (Nihilistic Empire / Twilight - Release October 15, 2010), the track features Tom Angelripper (Sodom) who is also managing the band through Death Squad Promotion.
