The Five Blobs were a group of studio musicians put together in 1958 by session leader Bernie Nee. The ensemble was assembled in Los Angeles for the express purpose of recording "The Blob", the title song for the Steve McQueen film The Blob. Written by Burt Bacharach and Mack David (Hal David's brother), the tune featured a prominent saxophone part. The single was released on Columbia Records and became a hit, peaking at #33 on the Billboard Hot 100[1] and hitting the Top Ten on the regional LA charts.[2] <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Five+Blobs">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
