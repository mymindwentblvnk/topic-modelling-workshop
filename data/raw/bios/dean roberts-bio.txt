Dean Roberts is a musician from New Zealand. During the mid 1990s he was a member of the trio Thela with Rosy Parlane and Dion Workman. After Thela disbanded, Roberts recorded 3 solo albums under the name White Winged Moth, followed by a series of releases under his own name. Slow, often wrenching songs where the brush of a cymbal, a voice or a plucked string can have great impact. Through arrangement, processing and editing Dean Roberts has crafted out rock that presents listeners with familiar forms as it challenges them with oblique gestures. Improvisational and electronic strategies are ably utilized to push the dimensions of rock songs played by a group of people together in one room.
Roberts has played a variety of solo gigs and played with some of the heavyweights of electrical/acoustic improvisation. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dean+Roberts">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
