Gus Drax was born in Larissa Greece on 21 of September 1987. He decided to play guitar at the age of 14 when he saw "Live in Tokyo" by Dream Theater and was amazed by John Petrucci. He started practicing for 6-12 hours a day.
At the age of 19 his talent was noticed by John K, the vocalist/band leader of the UK Progressive Metal Band Biomechanical. John suggested him to join the band and in August 2007 Gus was the new guitarist of Biomechanical. He toured the UK at February 2008 and since then he played at a lot of places all over Europe. Athens, Thessaloniki, Milan, Porto and Tolmin Slovenia!
The greatest moment so far was Biomechanical's participation in some of Europe's biggest Heavy Metal Festivals in front of thousands of people. These were Metalcamp (Slovenia), Rockin Field (Milan, Italy) and Caos-Emergente (Porto, Potrugal).
Besides Biomechanical Gus is going to release his first instrumental solo album in 2010 called "In Search Of Perfection" featuring Bob Katsionis (Firewind, Outloud) and Steve Smyth (Forbidden,ex-Nevermore, Testament) as guests. He's also writing material for a new band he recenlty formed. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gus+Drax">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
