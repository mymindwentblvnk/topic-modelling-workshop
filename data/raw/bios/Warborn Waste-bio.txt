Warborn Waste is a Modern Death Metal Band from The Hague. Warborn Waste is inspired by a wide variety of (sub)genres and like to incorporate as much of it into their own sound while holding onto the roots of Death Metal.

Warborn Waste consists of 5 members. Lorenzo on Lead guitar, Laurens on Rhythm guitar, Victor on vocals, Mick on bass and Max on drums. Warborn Waste is one of the youngest metal bands of The Hague, but you will be surprised by their love and passion for music. (Warborn Waste will release their first album ‘The Prophets of Dishonour’ this evening for you!)

They’ve played around about 20 shows as of now. You can expect that a gig from Warborn Waste is extremely powerful. They released their first album 'The Prophets of Dishonour' in April 2017. And meanwhile they’ve played with bands like Korpse, Rectal Smegma, Bodyfarm and The Charm The Fury. If you like Death Metal with modern influences you really need to come and see Warborn Waste! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Warborn+Waste">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
