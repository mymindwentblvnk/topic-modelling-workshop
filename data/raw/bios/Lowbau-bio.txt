Inspired by Silenus' words we stand as one,
Revealing higher truths to both the old and young.
Amongst our ranks there is no race, no gender and no class.
Those who ride on vanity will surely be surpassed.

We are a formation of experienced musicians, based in Vienna, Austria. Our musical influences are widely rooted in 60 years of music history and all of us bring in their individual taste and influences. We combine groovy uptempo rock and metal parts with slow crushing sludge. You will find heavily distorted guitars as well as harmonica and steel-guitars in our repertoire. We sing about individual fate and societal doom, but never without irony. We play a darker shade of blues.

Brothers, sisters, those in between:
Don't you hesitate too long.
Come and be part of this hazy dream.
You are highly welcome.
