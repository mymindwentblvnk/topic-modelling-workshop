At its heart, synthwave music is a love letter to convertibles, night drives, sunny beaches, and ‘80s nostalgia. Staying true to the genre, the mullet-sporting Ace Marino delivers the goods on his debut EP, a six-song effort with a diverse selection of music to entice and excite fans of retro synthesizer glory. Stylistically, Cocaine Flamingo lands near the center of synthwave music, and it frequently delivers a sound that recalls early contributors to the genre such as Lost Years and Miami Nights 1984. The recording is no rehash, however. Ace Marino keeps his recording modern and relevant by adding plenty of detail in the instrumentation and incorporating touches of outside genres. The result is a fresh spin on the genre’s classic sound that is distinctly more 2017 than 2007. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ace+Marino">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
