Havarax is a black metal (early)/melodic metalcore (recent) band from France that has been active since 2004, initially under the name of S.A.D. (Seasonal Affective Disorder). The first self-titled album came out that year, and LCR soon changed the name of the band to Havarax. In 2005 he released the second album "Guilty Pleasures", which was also self-released. In early 2007, Havarax came to the attention of Triskalyon, who asked them to join the circle. In the summer of that year, the third album "No Access to the Divine" was released on the small independent cassette label I.E.x.M.N., and was reissued on CD the following year by Odium Records. 2009 brought the band to a split with Diableriktus.

A new album should be released in 2011
