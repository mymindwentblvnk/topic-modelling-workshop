••Biography••
Awaken The Ancient was formed when their sister band, Eridian went on indefinite hiatus in 2010. The remaining Eridian members (Luke Shirley/Justin Naylon) sought to create a new project and contacted guitarist Adrien Bowens. After a few jams the band sought out bassist Barry Scarborough (whom originally started on guitar yet switched instruments to fill the void in the band.) thus forming as a four piece with the goal in mind to create catchy rhythmic death metal.

In 2011 A.T.A began writing music for their first full set. By February 4th, 2012 the band played it's first show at their stage in Avondale Estates. Along with many more shows the band began recording their first E.P(released on June 2nd 2013). 

Near the end of 2012 the band wanted to incorporate a second guitarist and brought in Gabe Katz.

By 2013 the band played it's last show with original bassist, Barry Scarborough on good terms, thus recruiting Ryan Buck.

A.T.A (with a new and refined sound) is now writing for their first full length and have begun venturing into a more progressive sound and are looking forward for what's to come... <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Awaken+The+Ancient">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
