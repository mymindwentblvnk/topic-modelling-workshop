Inner Logic began in the spring of 2008 by means of a crude DIY demo posted online.

The "Atomic Garden" demo was picked up by a few independent radio stations, and then much to our surprise, a management offer followed.

This resulted in the band recording an EP in September 2008 as a 3-piece (Dek, Ronnie & Craig) to send to
labels.

Feedback was generally positive and landed the band a deal with Alkemist Fanatix Europe, Antstreet Records and Warner/Chappell music in early 2010.

2011 sees the band release it's debut album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Inner+Logic">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
