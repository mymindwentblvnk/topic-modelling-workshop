Hooded Menace is a Finnish death doom metal band formed in Joensuu in 2007 by guitarist Lasse Pyykk√∂, who had previously performed in a death metal band named Phlegethon.

The band kick started their career by recording a two-track demo titled The Eyeless Horde in 2007, which was released on 7" vinyl the following year. The band released their debut album, Fulfill the Curse, in 2008; followed by the highly acclaimed sophomore full-length album, Never Cross the Dead, in 2010.

The band continued to record and release albums, with their third full-length album, Effigies of Evil, released in 2012; followed by Darkness Drips Forth in 2015. The band have also released several split albums and EPs, with bands such as Asphyx. The band released their fifth studio album, titled Ossuarium Silhouettes Unhallowed, in 2018. Their newest record, The Tritonus Bell, was released in 2021.

The band have also toured in Europe and North America, performing at many major metal festivals such as Hellfest, Roadburn, Maryland Deathfest, Tuska, and Party San Open Air among others.

The band plays a hybrid genre of music known as death-doom, which blends elements of death metal and doom metal, claiming influence from bands such as Candlemass, Cathedral, Paradise Lost, Asphyx and Winter, among others. The band's lyrics tend to revolve around horror stories, especially those within horror movies including The Blind Dead. Hooded Menace are looking to spread their music to fans of totally heavy and ultra-crushing doom and old school early 90's style death metal.
