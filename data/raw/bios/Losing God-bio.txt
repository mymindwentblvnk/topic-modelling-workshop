Losing God is the greatest thrash metal band in AZ. Period. Formed by Guitarist/Vocalist Mike "Jesus" Cross and Bassist J. "Woden" Lane in 2003, they set out to re-forge the roots of 80's thrash metal into a powerful new, and original beast.

After spending time to put he razors edge on some older songs and give birth to new ones, they decided it was time to complete their army of the damned. After several Drummers failed to cut the proverbial mustard, they found Nate "The Naked Drummer" Oliver. His aggressive and head-crushing drumming fit like a square peg rammed into you mom's hole, but, the band was still missing something. It was lacking a certain "Thunder". They discovered Guitarist Thor Shreddington and his ability to slam down the heaviest rhythms and blazing fast leads. He joined the band after a single audition and the four horsemen were ready to ride.

Losing God is single-handedly bringing thrash metal back to the status it deserves. Each member brings their own powerful, aggressive, and unique sound to the mix. Bent on world domination, Losing God have now set out to reach their goal, to bring true thrash metal back to the metal starved masses!!! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Losing+God">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
