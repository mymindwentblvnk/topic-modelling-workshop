Woman is the Earth is a band consisting of three members, brothers Jon and Andy Martin, and Jarrod Hattervig. The trio live in the Black Hills of South Dakota and have been playing music together since the summer of 2007, having met through activity in local music in the Black Hills, developing a strong DIY ethic throughout. Their mutual interests in musical movements such as the flux of American Black Metal in the West, ancestral folk music and an appreciation of highly textured, atmospheric music led to the formation of Woman is the Earth. The trio also share similar ethics in regard to spirituality and nature, creating a solid framework for the content of their music and ethos as a group. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Woman+is+the+Earth">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
