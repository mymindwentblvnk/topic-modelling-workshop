1. TAKEN BY FORCE hail from Baltimore City, and are here to crush with their blend of Merauder meets Death Threat style of metalcore/groove metal.

Following a couple of demo releases, their debut s/t 7" and full lenght come loaded with energetic fast parts and sing-a-long choruses combined with awesome metallic guitar riffs and breaks. Add in some sincerely bitter lyrics about friendship and betrayal, and that pretty much sums up what this band is all about.

2. TAKEN BY FORCE formed in Newcastle mid 2009, the five piece delivers a crushing blend of hardcore, metal. Since dropping their demo they have a regular run of shows. 

TBF are towards recording their debut album mid 2010 in Melbourne's inner city Three Phase Studios.
