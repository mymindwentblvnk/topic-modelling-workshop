A world of lawlessness and chaos was the catalyst which brought forth the extreme conditions that gave life to such a presence as Lord Payne. A horrific journey is written as you walk in his steps through life, death, destruction and to see the RISE OF DARKENESS from the SLAVE KING as all is laid to waste to his world.

A deathly tail you will witness as you follow the path of Payne as you see his enemies being BURIED IN BLOOD and the SINISTER DAWN as Payne summons the blood fed birth of Hell(Sinister Hell) and as the PROPHECY OF PAIN is met with Wretchlok the Destructor and Drakon.
