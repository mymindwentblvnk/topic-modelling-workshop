Hills Have Eyes were born from the ashes of an older project called Skapula. The band was founded in the year 2005 in Setubal - Portugal, after the entrance of two members, Pedro Pais (ex More Than a Thousand), and China. The decision to end Skapula and build a stronger project created Hills Have eyes and the band recorded their debut EP "All Doves Have Been Killed" between February and October 2005. In it, they tackle topics such as friendship, cynicism, love, and a lot more feelings that people face in their everyday lives. In 2012 and 2015, two self-released albums followed in "Strangers" and "Antebellum". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hills+Have+Eyes">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
