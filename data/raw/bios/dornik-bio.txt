Dornik is a British singer, songwriter and record producer. 

Dornik started out as the drummer in Jessie Ware's band, but it wasn't long until he was promoted to singing with her after she heard some recordings he had penned and produced himself. The demo's were handed over to Jessie Ware's label (PMR) and the rest, as they say, is history.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dornik">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
