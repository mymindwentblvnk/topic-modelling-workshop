4 A.M. is a German eurodance group.
Even if their single was released in 2003, the sound reminds the good eurodance of the 90's.
The vinyl contained 3 versions : a Back To The 90's mix, an Upset mix and a Soul solutions version. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/4+A.M.">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
