Beauty of Desolation is a French band, formed by the end of the '90s, originally composed of Rehcnalb (vocals),Yama (bass), Domestos (drumms) and Jerome (guitar). When Domestos decides to leave the band, Beauty of Desolation start using a drum machine. Meanwhile, two new guitarists arrive: Necros and Nergal. 

Beauty of Desolation's music is influenced by the Death and Black Metal scene, but also the Doom and the Gothic ones. The musicians try to keep only the essence of these influences - the force and the refinement of the chaos - naming their music Apocalyptic Black Metal. Later on, the synths are introduced.

They release their first demo, called "Worlds Agony" in the spring of 2000, and later their first full-lenght album - "Cold Emotions", 2002. 

Current line-up:
Rehcnalb - vocals
Yama - bass & programming
Necros - guitars
Donn - guitars
