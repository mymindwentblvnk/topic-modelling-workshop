Strings 24 is a new project created by Frank Caruso, Stefano “Sebo” Xotta and Gianluca Ferro. Three axemen, coming from different musical experiences, decided to mix their styles into a new band dedicated to guitar, with the aim to raise its musical expression and compositive potential. Been these three artists into the music business for many years, their new project immediately gathered broad attention from record labels, magazines, radio and TV networks. Frank, Sebo and Gianluca are proud users of Ibanez guitars. The band's name comes from the three guitarists' use of 8 string guitars (3x8=24). First Strings 24 album was released in early 2009. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Strings+24">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
