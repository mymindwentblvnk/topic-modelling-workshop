First conceived in 2004 by lead singer/songwriter Tarin Kerrey, Sanguine are a four piece, female fronted alternative metal band. 

Sanguineâ€™s music was never designed with one genre in mind, describing themselves as alt-metal purely because no other term seemed to fit, and their mix of sweet-innocent vocals and music coupled with stab-victim screams and grinding riffs. Sanguine are also well know for their energetic shows, always commiting every ounce of energy regardless of the venue.

Songs: Tonight, Innocence, Don't Change, Recognition
