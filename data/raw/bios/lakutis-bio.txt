Lakutis is a first generation Russian American rapper born in NYC and based in Washington Heights. His explosive style on stage is informed as much by rap as New York hardcore punk rock. His debut album '3 Seashells' breaks boundaries with its innovative style that disregards classic rap conventions in favor of more experimental structure.    <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lakutis">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
