Danny Boy or DB (born October 31, 1977) is the stage name of Chicago native Danny Boy Steward, a contemporary African-American soul  singer. He was signed to Death Row Records when he was just 14. He made his debut on 1994's Murder Was the Case soundtrack with the R&B charter Come When I Call (Produced by DJ Quik). In 1995, he released his first single entitled Slip N Slide (Produced by Reggie Moore and co-produced by DeVante Swing) with then unknown artist Ginuwine  singing the chorus. The video was shot in Cabo, and also features scenes with 2Pac, Snoop Dogg, Nate Dogg and Tha Dogg Pound.
