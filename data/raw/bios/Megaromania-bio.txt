Megaromania was a Japanese visual kei power metal band formed in 2008 and disbanded in 2013.

One of UNDER CODE PRODUCTION's newest additions, formed in January 2008, even before Sui and Misery left their old band. Megaromania consists of ex-members of bands such as Metis Gretel, 焔, STELLA... and 般 若 (hAN-NyA). 
They signed a contract with the Under Code Production label quite soon after they formed and, up to now, have released 11 Maxi-singles, 2 mini-albums , 2 full-length albums, 3 collection album, 7 live-distributed singles, and 8 promotional videos ("God of Megaromania-純血ノ刻印-," "Apocalypse,"  "AURORA-destinies of world-," and "Quintessence Voyage," "Cynthia," "Propaganda,"  "Heaven's Novel," respectively).

Their concept is titled "Creativity aesthetics", their sound is reminiscent of Metis Gretel to an certain extent. Their style is a more modernized style of kotekote kei than Metis Gretel was, although it appears that they are gradually moving towards a more metallic direction since the release of "Oblivious." In March of 2010, the band's drummer, Leda, left the band due to musical differences. AURORA-destinies of world- was the first release from Megaromania without Leda. For this single, as well as for live support, the band borrowed E'm～Grief～'s drummer Maiyu. Start with the single Oath-Cross of Eternity-, the band recruited a new drummer, Yushi. Since his addition to the band, Megaromania has been putting out material at a slightly faster rate as well as started to appear higher on visual indies sales charts.

The band split in the summer of 2013 presumably due to UNDER CODE PRODUCTION going out of business. After nearly a year of no activity aside from a few session bands and a Metis Gretel revival show, it was announced that Sui, Misery (who changed his name to 'MIZALY'), and Yushi would be 3 of the 4 new members in the second period of 凛 -the end of corruption world-, the band of former UNDER CODE president Kisaki.
