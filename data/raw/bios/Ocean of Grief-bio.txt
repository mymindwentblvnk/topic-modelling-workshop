Ocean of Grief was founded in 2014 when bassist Giannis(ex-Typhon) and guitarist Filippos(ex-Typhon) decided to form a band musically close to the melodic doom/death metal genre. The keyboards and guitar duties were handled by Aris(Meden Agan, Memorain) and Panagiotis Kyriakou respectively, who also introduced Thomas to the band, as a drummer. The band's line up was completed with the arrival of Charalabos on vocals and then the bands 1st song, Drowned in Nostalgia, was recorded at Panagiotis' home studio as a demo.  Following the song's upload, Panagiotis had to leave the band in order to move permanently to Australia so a new guitarist needed to be found as soon as possible. Luckily, Dimitra (ex-Final Words Of Sorrow) auditioned for the band, she became a regular member and the band started working on its first official release. EP's recordings started, eventually, at autumn of 2015 and the EP was finished at early 2016 when the russian lebel GS Productions agreed with the band to release the EP driving the band to intense rehearsals in order to get to the stage as soon as possible to support its material. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ocean+of+Grief">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
