1) Remember is an ambient / vaporwave artist whose debut album ルートバックホーム was released on Dream Catalogue in August 2015. A second album entitled ハートエイクに歩い was released by PLUS100 Records in November 2015. 

2) Just a fourpiece Hardcore Band from Dortmund/Germany.

We decided to make a fast and aggressive mixture of modern hardcore and punk.
Our first record is a home-made live admission
which was published together with Eleven Days Records.

Remember from dortmund saw the light of day in summer 2008. One year, one tour, one demo and many, many shows later, we finished our debut-7" 'Death To All Of Us'. The five songs are intensive and stirring to the bone, full of desperation and disbelief, but always powerful and straight ahead. We made a preorder-edition of this record in solid white vinyl. The residual copies are available in clear and blue wax. You can download the complete EP for free, just check the relevant web pages. 

3) Simply a Hard Rock band from Caracas Venezuela
