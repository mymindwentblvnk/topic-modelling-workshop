Doomed Youth are an American punk rock/crossover thrash metal band that began in Colorado in the early 2000’s. Formed by brothers Chris and Jon Heffernan they recruited future Clusterfux bassist Joe Piker.  Their early influences were mostly UK ‘82 bands like the Skeptix and the Exploited; their sound was traditional street punk. Later moving to Atlanta, Georgia in 2005 the band went through many lineup changes releasing multiple demos along the way. After adding a second guitarist, John “Mange” Manger and bassist Matt Moyer the band’s music crossed over to an early thrash metal sound.   Predominately a live band, Doomed Youth has only produced a handful of demos and a downloadable EP through Moshpit Tragedy records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Doomed+Youth">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
