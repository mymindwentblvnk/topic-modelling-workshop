Seasons of Six are a heavy/thrash metal act from London, UK. Having gone through some rough times and many line-up changes the band managed to reach for a prestigious slot at the South African Witchfest directly before Carcass. At the beginning of 2009 Marcel, one of the two founding members, Velvet Cuts, Cletus Van Dame and Zack decided to leave the project to Jason, the other founding member of Seasons of Six, and go on with a brand new name - Affluenza. The band's only outing remains the ‘Hunger For Your Self’ (Eyes of Sound, 2006). As of spring of 2009, Jason managed to recruit brand new crew and so it happens that Seasons of Six are looking forward to the bright future yet again... <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Seasons+Of+Six">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
