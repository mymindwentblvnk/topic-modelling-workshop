S.Y.P.H (pronounced like the German word "Siff" which means "muck" or "filth") is a german punk band, which was formed in 1977 in Solingen by Harry Rag (Singer, born Peter Braatz), Uwe Jahnke (Guitar) and Thomas Schwebel (Bass).
Schwebel soon left the band to join the Duesseldorf band Mittagspause and went on to form Fehlfarben. 
Early S.Y.P.H. was quick and abrasive with sharp and witty lyrics as in the anti-Hippie hymns "Zurück zum Beton" (back to concrete) and "Industriemädchen" (Industry Girl), in the 1980s they moved on to long, improvisational and dubby soundscapes in the Krautrock vein, collaborating with Can's Holger Czukay on his 1981 solo album "On The Way To the Peak Of Normal", while still retaining their punk edge.
Harry Rag is now a renowned filmmaker and lives in Ljubljana, Slovenia. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/S.Y.P.H.">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
