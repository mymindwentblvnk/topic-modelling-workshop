The Canadian outfit known as Blasphemy was formed in 1984 in Burnaby, BC.. They are known for creating a small sub-genre known as “war metal”. Each member does not go by their real name, but use ‘’ritual’‘-style titles instead. Blasphemy is considered a black metal band, and while the guitar riffs/solos and blast beat drumming certainly fit the black metal mold, the vocals and general instrumentation are more death metal derived, similar to Von or Sarcófago. They are recognized as being one of the first, if not THE first, band to play black metal in Canada, at a time when few metal scenes around the world had even heard of black metal. Their discography is as follows:

Blood Upon the Altar (demo) - 1989
Fallen Angel of Doom (LP) - 1990 [re-released on LP & CD in 2007 via Nuclear War Now! Productions]
Gods of War (LP) - 1993
Die Hard Rehearsal (demo) - 2001
Live ritual - Friday the 13th (live LP) - 2002

Despite the fact that their releases are few in number, and they have not released a full length album in over 10 years, Blasphemy is still active as of this writing.
