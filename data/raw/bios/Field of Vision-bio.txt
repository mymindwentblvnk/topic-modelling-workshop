FIELD OF VISION are a UK Prog Rock band from Scotland, originally formed in 1988 and recently re-formed to write & record new material after several years hiatus. An EP is listed to be released in August 2014

In 1988, the core 3 members of FOV - Martin Haggarty, Graham Holley and David MacDonald, met in Glasgow to jam some ideas with a view to forming a progressive rock band. Immediately striking up a rapport, the vocalist, keyboardist & drummer set about finding two other kindred spirits to make up Field of Vision.
