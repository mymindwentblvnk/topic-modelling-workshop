Aldo Giuntini's career began at the start of the 80's when he founded CRYIN’ EARTH, a Progressive Rock group who played their own brand of refined and complex music that attracted a dedicated and coherent following. The legendary concert at International Film Studio, attended by some of the most respected progressive music experts, was Giuntini’s farewell to CRYIN’ EARTH. His decision brought him to move into the newly-born Italian Heavy Metal scene. From 1984 to 1987 he mainly concentrated on perfecting his distinctive sound going on to build up a new band called SKY DRIVERS. But soon he realized that the only way to develop his ideas unadulterated was to make his name as a solo artist. 

In 1995, Aldo began working on tracks for his new album and in 1996 he approached Tony Martin, the English singer who had branched off after a long spell with BLACK SABBATH. Martin was impressed by Aldo's demos and the two musicians decided to pool their talents. 

Giuntini’s second album also got a very ample international recognition and gave Aldo the spotlight he deserved for his music. Finally after another few years of hard work the new GIUNTINI PROJECT album simply entitled "III" hits the market. Winning team should not change, so Aldo called again Tony Martin to handle lead vocals and secured the help of Ezio Secomandi (on drums), Dario Patti (on keyboards) and Fulvio Gaslini (on bass) to achieve the perfect results. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Giuntini+Project">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
