There is more than 1 artist with this name:

1.) A finely tuned state of the art machine fronted by Andreas Mj√∏s from JAGA JAZZIST and featuring classical composers, jazz musicians and pop singers. Performatively disciplined in an ebb and flow of bloom and decay simultaneously so the transparencies of rock and jazz are corroded to an apex of idiosyncratic coagulation. Viral acidity bubbling from the core in self destruct mode. Jazzooka for those open to music exploring and exploding genres.

2.) Washington, DC (USA) area rock/electronica band (www.rotoscope.com) that debuted in 2001 comprised of a rotating cast of characters based around guitarist/keyboardist/programmer/vocalist John Athayde (of Juniper Lane and Boboroshi & Kynz and formerly of Honor by August and No Second Troy) and includes members of Juniper Lane, Loch and Key, and former members of Industry Overflow.  Released two EPs (One Day - 2002, Vista Del Mar - 2003) and one single (All That's Left - 2005). EP (Clean Lines) to be released 27 Oct 2017, LP (Permanent Daylight) to be released in 2018 <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rotoscope">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
