Delia Gonzalez and Gavin Russom's relationship began on a dancefloor, so it's only fitting that the eccentric duo became one of the DFA label's least dance-oriented acts. More inspired by '70s electronic artists from Germany — such as Tangerine Dream, Harmonia, and Ash Ra Tempel's Manuel Göttsching — than British post-punk and early house (like many of their labelmates), the New York-based duo debuted with a 12" single in early 2004. A beat-driven remix from DFA's James Murphy and Tim Goldsworthy appeared on the B-side. Since it gained more attention than the beat-less A-side, some listeners were surprised to discover that The Days of Mars, the duo's first album, was entirely beat-less, containing four lengthy tracks that were composed on Russom's bank of self-made analog synthesizers. Gonzalez and Russom have also recorded with Murphy, Goldsworthy, and Christian Holstad as Black Leotard Front (2004's Casual Friday single, also released on DFA). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Delia+Gonzalez+and+Gavin+Russom">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
