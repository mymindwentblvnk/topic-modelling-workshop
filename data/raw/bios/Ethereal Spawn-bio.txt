The music of the band almost naturally evolved into an extreme mixture of melody and intensity, which proved to be exactly what all band members were looking for.

Ethereal Spawn’s debut, “Ablaze in Viral Flames” (with cover artwork by Niklas Sundin) was released March 28th 2000. It counts nine melodic death metal tracks including a cover of Dark Tranquillity’s “Punish My Heaven” and two instrumentals. The band received a lot of positive response to this release, the best example being the review that appeared in Aardschok magazine in july 2000. Ethereal Spawn also competed in Aardschok’s Metal Bash 2000 and the Metal Battle of 2001 and songs of the band were featured on several compilation CD’s.

The recordings of their follow-up, “The Glint of Eden”, took place on the 7th and 8th of june 2001.
