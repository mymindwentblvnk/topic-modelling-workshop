As you read this, Killing Chapel is hard at work, developing new material and seeking opportunities to deliver it live to eager metal fans all over the world. They have an upcoming show Aug 17th opening for the Death Metal / Grindcore band Mortician and Rumplestiltskin Grinder at the Sterling Hotel. 

Killing Chapel digs deep beneath the surface...exploring the twisted desires of humanity and confronting the harsh realities of existence in the world in which we all must live.
