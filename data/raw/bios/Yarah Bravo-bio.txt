Yarah Bravo (born in Sweden to a Chilean mother and a Brazilian father) is a musician blurring the lines between spoken word, hip-hop, and RnB. Notable appearances include collaborations with French avant-garde rap group TTC and Polish acid jazz duo Skalpel. However, she is best-known for her appearances on DJ Vadim's USSR: The Art of Listening, and most recently together with Vadim (her husband) and New York City MC Blu Rum 13 as the group One Self. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Yarah+Bravo">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
