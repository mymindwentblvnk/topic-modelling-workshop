In June 2008, the bloody craft of Bloodland began. The topical lineup exists of musicians who could already collect experiences in other metal-bands. THE LINEUP IS 

MICK voc. 
PETER lg. 
STEFAN rg. 
ROB bg. 
CHRIS dr. (M.A.D., Senistro, Overlord). 

It's been played of crude Oldschool Death Metal/ Brutal Death Metal in genres like: colleagues like Obituary, Cannibal Corpse, Severe Torture or also Torture Killer and Bolt Thrower hold. Among the rest of the Bloodland tape, since the middle of 2009, belong: MANOS, LAY DOWN ROTTEN, POSTMORTEM, DIE APOCALYPTISCHEN REITER, DISASTER KFW,  DEBAUCHERY, VARG, DEFLORATION, THY FINAL PAIN, MOSHQUITO, SABIENDAS, GOMORRHA, DARKENED NOCTURN SLAUGHTERCULT, DEMOGORGON, MASTIC SCUM, POPPY SEED GRINDER and others.

In December 2009 Bloodland went to the studio to produce the first single. The first single was a promo CD because of cost-technical reasons there are only 4 tracks on it. Death Metal Horns are still blowing brutal in the Oldschool direction. 

The CD was finished in February 2010 and is available here and at our gigs. In the next year a new album is planned. We'd like to prove more in this genre that we belong to and in which we are serious.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bloodland">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
