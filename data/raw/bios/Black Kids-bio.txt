Black Kids are an indie rock band who formed in Jacksonville, Florida, United States in 2006. Rolling Stone called them one of ten "Artists to Watch" in 2008 and they were also included in the BBC Top 10 Sound of 2008 poll on the back of their demo EP Wizard of Ahhhs. Their debut album proper, Partie Traumatic, was released in July 2008 and debuted at #5 on the UK Albums Chart. After a long hiatus punctuated by several failed attempts to record a follow-up, occasional touring, and development of side projects, the band released its comeback single,  Obligatory Drugs, in October 2016, with the full-length album Rookie emerging in September 2017. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Black+Kids">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
