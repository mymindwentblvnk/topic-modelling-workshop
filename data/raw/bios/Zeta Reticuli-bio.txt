There are several artists that use the name Zeta Reticuli:

1) Italian DJ, real name Pasquale Gigli, when doing work with Gigi D'Agostino. Known for the track Benomale.

2) A symphonic black metal band from Australia:

Formed in 2008 Zeta Reticuli was given life by Scourge (Guitars and Vox (now Keys as well)), Moth (Keyboards) and Shtigra (Bass Guitar). Drummer Massacre was quickly recruited with Moth leaving shortly after.
In 2009 the band had a few problems with Shtigra and recorded the demo Through Twilight Openings without him which lead to Massacre recording the bass parts as well as the outro.

As stated by their members, Zeta Reticuli’s vision is to create atmospheric and symphonic black metal without reverting to a more commercial and cleaner sounding approach.

The band is currently working on finding a keyboardist to play live and rehearsing new material for an upcoming full-length; “Towards The Forest Of Stars”. An Ep shall be released later to follow up the new album.

3) A funk rock band, location unknown
