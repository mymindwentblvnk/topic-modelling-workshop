I was born in Shizuoka, Japan. As a track maker / DJ. 
I bring sampling to the core of every day HIPHOP, in the central organization under the theme of "music and everyday coexistence". "The Music is Any Moments in Life."
I express what I felt while I lived by a sound. I hope that you as a listener have your own sound in your life.
I regard scenes and relevance to feelings as important, and make a sound  giving it "an ease "well-defined tightened feeling such wind when I open a book" to fall asleep just before that".
I always grope for a new thing without being always satisfied, and I continue always challenging it, 
and my name, "DJ OKAWARI", comes from it. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/DJ+Okawari">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
