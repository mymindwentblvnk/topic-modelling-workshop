About
Corpse Hoarder was formed in the fall of 2012 from the remnants of A Plague, a band that Scruffo, Chris and former drummer Angelo were previously a part of. 
They picked up Ken on bass to round out the lineup and continued working & writing songs. Angelo left the band in March of 2013, and a few months later in June they recruited Armen to fill the void, and once again have a solid lineup. Stay tuned, Corpse Hoarder will be coming your way soon...
