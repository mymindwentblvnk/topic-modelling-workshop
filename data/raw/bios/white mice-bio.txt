A three piece noise rock outfit (bass, drums and oscillator) from Providence, RI. Sometimes seen as "the White Mice" but more commonly as just "White Mice". The band dresses as mutilated/mutated laboratory mice during their live performances (see artist photos), and have played with labelmates Lightning Bolt on many occasions. The band has recently finished a tour where they opened for Skinny Puppy.
