There are two bands named Guitar, this page is for Michael Luckner's Guitar project.  If you are looking for DJ Alibi's band, you can find it at Guitar the Band.    

Michael Luckner's Guitar project is an exploration of (and love-letter to) the eponymous instrument.

Luckner's enlightened approach to guitar noise is further sweetened by a simple but well-placed peppering of slow breakbeats and the soothing sighs of siren Ayako Akashiba, with guest spots from the likes of Regina of Donna Regina, Voyager One, and Henning Neuser. The place where it all falls together is somewhere in the midst of autumn in Okinawa and a beachfront daydream.
