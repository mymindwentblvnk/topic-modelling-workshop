There are two bands (at least) named Vulpecula:

1) A black/death metal band from the USA
2) A death metal band from Poland

-----

1) From its genesis in January 1994 by Chuck Keller (vocals, 
guitar, bass guitar, keyboards, effects), Vulpecula's focus has been 
a celebration of the night. With overwhelming emotion and 
noctilucent atmosphere, this Kansas City, Missouri based band wanders the 
seemingly infinite stellar fields of nothingness revealing to the
listener distant vistas of sound. By bridging the seeming gulf
between "space music" and death/black metal, Vulpecula has
successfully molded together the two most atmospheric forms of
music in existence.

Solo project of Ares Kingdom guitarist Chuck Keller.

Vulpecula is a star constellation in space.

This project was officially ended in 1999.

2) Death metal band formed in Gdynia, Poland in 1990.
