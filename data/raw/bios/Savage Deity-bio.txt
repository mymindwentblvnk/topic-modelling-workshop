Savage Deity are a death metal band from Thailand. 

 Formed in late 2010, the trio is comprised of Twish on vocals and bass, Tanasan on drums and Ray on lead and rhythm guitars.
S.D. play blistering death metal, with a heavy dose of old school style tempered with more technical influences.
Vocals are very much in the old school vein, and the drums switch between hard blast beats and solid tempo batteries. 
For fans of all serious death metal. 
Savage Deity have a unique and brutal sound all of their own. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/SAVAGE+DEITY">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
