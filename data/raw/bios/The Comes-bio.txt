The Comes from Tokyo were one of the first Japanese hardcore bands and their eleven song 12" entitled No Side is one of the best early punk records. The band first appeared on the Outsider compilation LP in 1982 along with such seminal Japanese outfits as GISM, Gauze, and Laughin Noise. No Side came out in 1984. The music was fast, rocking hardcore with melodic guitar and a totally insane woman on lead vocals. The songs on this LP combine these hell-shriek vocals, massive hooks, and the stop-start hardcore of Minor Threat, but Comes had a screeching, spastic energy unlike anything in the US. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Comes">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
