Darkness Rising in Mikkeli, FINLAND!!!

Jani and Eke met each other in a pub, and then many times after that in 2006. Each time they met, they talked about how much they would like to form a band. One day they decided to put their plan into action and for almost 1.5 years they played as a duo. After Jurassic Rock 2007, Sauli joined the band. Rehearsing didn’t happen often, but when we had been confirmed to play at Dokata Uprising (Private party) 22.3.2008, rehearsing became more professional. 
Two weeks before the Dokata Uprising gig, Jani asked Joanna (his younger sister) to join the band as a keyboard player. Joanna accepted and became the fourth member of the band. 
Our fifth member, Vesku joined just 3 weeks before our second gig at the BlackOut Pub in Mikkeli on 1.11.2008. There we played with another local band called Hatered. Soon after the BlackOut Pub gig, Joanna left Darkened Souls. She lives quite far away from Mikkeli and getting to the rehearsals was often quite difficult. It was the end of phase one. 
Darkened Souls started to search for new keyboard player immediately after Joanna left, but it seemed to be a lot harder than we thought. Maybe keyboard players are some kind of mythical creatures or something like that? We played one gig without a keyboard player, but it just didn’t feel or sound right, so we decided to start record some demo and promo material in early 2009. Somehow Sauli woke up from his hallucinations and remembered his good old friend Samuli. Samuli came to the rehearsal chambers and proved to all of us that he is the right man to stand behind our keyboard. It felt like a light at the end of a dark tunnel to us. We had found a new keyboard player and really good one. 
So far the band has been better than we could have dreamed for!!!
