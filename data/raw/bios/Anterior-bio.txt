Tredegar, Wales (2003 - 2012)

The band formed in late 2003, as a group of individuals inspired by their passion for metal. At the mere age of 17 they began to create the epic sound that they wield today. Combining thunderous riffs, technically exceptional guitar work, relentless drive, and an abundance of melody, they forged a unique style that captures an ever growing army of fans!

During their short yet illustrious career, they have risen above all, to share stages with household names: DragonForce, The Black Dahlia Murder, Himsa, 3 Inches Of Blood and Mendeed to name but a few. Together with these high profile shows and extensive local radio play Anterior have proven that they push the boundaries of modern musicianship to a new level, competing with bands much older and more established than their selves.

Matured musicianship and the sheer determination and ambition to succeed, helped the band create their first studio recording “This Age Of Silence” proving technical dexterity and remarkable creativity, that transcends the boundaries of bands today.

The band's second album "Echoes of the Fallen" was released on the 26th of August, 2011  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Anterior">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
