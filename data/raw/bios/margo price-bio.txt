Margo Rae Price (born April 15, 1983) is an American country singer-songwriter based in Nashville, Tennessee. The Fader has called her "country's next star." Her debut solo album Midwest Farmer's Daughter was released on Third Man Records on March 25, 2016. The album was recorded at Sun Studio in Memphis, Tennessee, and was engineered by Matt Ross-Spang. The album was recorded in three days. On tour, she is backed by her band the Pricetags.

Price grew up in the small town of Aledo, Illinois, where she played piano and sang in church choir before studying dance and theater at Northern Illinois University. She dropped out of school in 2003, at age 20, and moved to Nashville, Tennessee.

Price cites Janis Joplin, Bobbie Gentry, Emmylou Harris, Bonnie Raitt, Todd Snider, and Dolly Parton as major influences. Her voice has also been compared to those of Loretta Lynn and Tammy Wynette. Price's great-uncle, Bobby Fischer, was a songwriter for George Jones, Conway Twitty, Charley Pride and Reba McEntire. Nashville Scene noted that she often writes about "life's cruel twists and unjust turns" and that "her matter-of-factness conveys an enduring humility." In an interview with Aquarium Drunkard, Price admitted that "for a very long time, I didn't want to be a white girl, I wanted to be a soul singer", listing James Brown and Etta James as particular favorites. 

On July 27, 2017, Price released a four-track EP titled Weakness, followed by her second full-length album All American Made on October 20, 2017.

In December 2018, Price received a nomination for Best New Artist at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards.

On July 10, 2020 she released her third full-length album Thatâ€™s How Rumors Get Started. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Margo+Price">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
