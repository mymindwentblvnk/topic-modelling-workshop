BLOW is a French music group. BLOW is an alchemy. Not only between members, all of whom have been friends for years, but also between pop and electronic music. An intelligent balance that has characterized the music of these Parisians for the last four years. With three EPs already under its belt (“I” followed by “Fall in the Deep” in 2016 and “Vertigo Introduction” in January 2018), the group has cemented its place as one of the most promising French electronic pop bands by releasing its first album “Vertigo” in 2018. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Blow">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
