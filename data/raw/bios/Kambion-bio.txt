Kambion was born late 2006 by Guitarist Troy 'Iznah' Halls, He was shortly joined by long-time friend Jack 'Corpus' Mason who provides session drums for all Kambion recordings. The band delivers fast, raw black metal however, prevalent throughout their work is a parody of Black Metal. However Troy has given up on his Kambion dreams as he foremed Labyrinth Of Absence, a metal/hardcore band with J-RAD purcell along with Xjamie byrneX.
