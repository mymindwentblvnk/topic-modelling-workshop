2002- Wicked Ischanius and Cruciatus spawned the necrosound demo assault in form of Death Thrashers Kuopio and "Zombies... Apocalypse.. And other nice things"! At the end of the year, J.Noisehunter joined the band to play the unholy bass-saw!

2003- Death Thrashers Kuopio appeared in "Necromancy.. Blood.. Vengeance!" Demo-tape! More madness and bad taste followed in the form of Torzul, our new guitar player.

2004- We just rehearsed and earned bad reputation with live gig . Did some recording too. Those recordings  later appeared on "Metal on metal" compilation CD and "Thrash metal blitzkrieg" compilation 7" EP! Cruciatus decided to leave the posse, but there was some more to come.

2005- We put our old-school line-up to rest at the almost legendary Vuoritalo gig, it was crazed event, and won't be forgotten by the band ever! We recruited two new members, Nevastator and Kami-Kaze. Ironfist Kommando Productions from Chile re-issued our demos on tape and we appeared on "Metal on metal" compilation CD. In search of lost inspiration D.T.K. was buried...

2006- Moons pass by... and later this year Cruciatus and the lost inspiration found again to our souls and it was time to set-up our anti-musical weapons ready for next assault. A lot of rehearsing of both, the old and the new tracks. Plans for recording the 3rd demo are getting stronger and stronger.

2007- Rehearsing continues and recording the 3rd demo has become something that must be done. The recordings started 26th of January. Will it ever see the darkness of the night? Only thing we can say this far is that it all looks very promising right now... <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Death+Thrashers+Kuopio">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
