melodic doom metal with intense atmosphere

Extorian doesn't just celebrate pure doom, but uses its traditional elements such as sublime slowness and lava-like thick walls of guitar, which creates a unique experience in metal when combined with vocalist Heikes' flesh-creeping melodies and compact arrangements. Extorian will appeal to many metal- and rock-fans outside the narrow doom-genre, if they have the attention span to appreciate the eight minute mini-epics which Extorian unleashes upon the listener.
