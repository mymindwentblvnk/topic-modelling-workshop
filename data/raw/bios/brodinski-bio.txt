Brodinski, 1 has his right hand on the hardened minimalist edge and his left hand on the electro party scene. He's part of the fluokids phenomenon. His sets are clean but the tracks are dirty, and the "mix tapes" he offers on his blog never disappoint.
Baby Djs are awake since 2006, be careful Brodinski may be the bad boy of this blogaddicted gang !
Coming from Reims, he started music at 15 and just never stopped hitting the dancefloor harder and harder...
His friendship with Yuksek helped him to begin the production of music of mass destruction: "Bad runner" is  a must play for any DJ dealing with bloghouse and maximalist techno sets! 
He also appears on many hostings and mashups with his friends creating new dimensions of his work:
Noob & Brodinski, Mumdance & Brodinski, Gucci Vump , The Krays (aka Yuksek & Brodinski) .
"Brodi" is now resident for Panik parties in Paris... Boom Chick Boom Ah !
