A trio of rock-loving lifelong friends hailing from Norwich, UK- guitarist/vocalist Matt Pearce, bassist Matt Rabong and drummer Ben Giller have been playing in various bands together for nearly ten years. The combined musical influences in Clan bring forth a record that will please fans of vintage fuzz, blues rock and dirty beats- a keen sense of vocal melody combined with grooving guitar/bass unison riffs and thunderous drums. At a recent gig, Clan were described as “The Dead Weather meets Deep Purple Mark II with a hint of Fu Manchu and Kyuss.”

Entirely self-recorded, mixed and mastered by the band using their own studio, equipment and knowledge, this E.P. is a true DIY affair.  

Clan are currently working on a promotional video and recording their next five songs, with a view to an album release and expanding their fanbase across the UK in 2014. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Clan">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
