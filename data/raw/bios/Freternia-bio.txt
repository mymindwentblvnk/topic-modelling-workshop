A deal was made with Loud'N'Proud records and the debutalbum "Warchants & Fairytales" was recorded at StudioMega, Sweden. 2000 "W&F" is released. 2001 LNP got financial difficulties and we decided to search for a new label. "Promo 2001" was recorded. 2002 A new deal was made with Arise Records (Spain) and "A Nightmare Story" (Studio Underground) was released. 2003 Three new members and an upcoming recording of a third release.
