With a new line up since 2005, Mental Horror started a new concept of their own music. In just a couple of months after, they had written some annihilating songs with significantly more depth than they had never done before. 

With the purpose to spread their music out from Brazil, Mental Horror went out to Europe for the first time; between May and June-2006, and played in festivals all over Europe, including Neurotic Death Fest, Festung Open air, and Fuck the commerce.  With a great response from the crowds and the death metal scene in general, Mental Horror have just released their savage masterpiece: Blemished Redemption, on Mutilation records in Brazil, and on Animate Records in Europe.
