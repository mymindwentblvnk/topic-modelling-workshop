Tephros is a Venezuelan symphonic black metal band, formed in 2007 by Jose M Perez, Deivis Guédez and Luis Manuel Guédez. The band is currently active as a "one man band" by the hand of José M. Pérez (main composer and instrumentist), with vocal collaborations of Deivis Guédez.
 
The first EP, Abismo, was released in 2011, recorded in the home studio of José M. Pérez. The release was limited to 50 copies. Before the release of the first full-length album (planned to be entitled Mundo Miserable), the band suffered many lineup changes until finally splitted at 2014.
 
After a couple of years inactive, José M. Pérez started again the composing, musical arrangements and recording of the material, which resulted in the album Between Angels and Demons, released in 2016 by dbStudio (José M. Pérez´s own studio). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tephros">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
