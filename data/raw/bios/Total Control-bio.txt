Somewhere in the breeding patterns of the 80s noise punk movements and the synth head movement birthed the synth punks Total Control. Drawing influence from what seems Futuristik, Screamers, and Perhaps Devo, they bring to the table a crunched up no wave dancefloor numbers. Sawtooth leads over frantic punk beats interloping into a obnoxious yet capturing piece. The building progressive Kraftwerk leads into chip-tune solos like a busted cartage game. Paranoid video is a track you would find on the mixtape of some rebelious adolescent from a post apocalyptic timeline. (by Alex Auclair)
