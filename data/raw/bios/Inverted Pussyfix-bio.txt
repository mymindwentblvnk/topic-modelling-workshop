Inverted Pussyfix is a band from Split, Croatia. Closest musical description is grindcore/metal altho their music has alot of different styles mixed up. The bend is active since 2007 formed up by Djogo and Ticha, when they managed to call upon their fellow band members the idea was to play calssical grind core music with pigsqueals that wasn't popular in our region, but the idea wasn't fully realised, they formed their own style of music that is somehow different then typical grind core. After the first gig in hometown Split, they got an offer to perform in Sarajevo, Bosna i Herzegovina where they left a good impression. Since then they played a lot over those 2 countries as support to various bends, such as Warbringer(USA), Poppy Seed Grinder (CZE),etc. The band never changed the members and still rages on with their wild scene performance and groovy rhythms. 
For now, they have released one full-length album Repugnant, one demo Piece of Uterus and two splits.
