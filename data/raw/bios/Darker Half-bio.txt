Darker Half play METAL: drawing on the roots of classic heavy metal, they have been inspired by thrash, power, death, speed and more to build a unique style all their own. 

Darker Half come from Sydney Australia. The band is based around the dual guitars of Vo Simpson and Brad Dickson. The guitar harmonies of Vo and Brad intertwine searing lead breaks with Vo's screaming power vocals and brutal doom growl across the solid yet adventurous bass and drums of Simon Hamilton and Dom Simpson. 

The band has existed since 2005 playing shows throughout Sydney and regularly visiting major cities on the east coast playing with many of Australias most renowned metal acts including Mortal Sin, Vanishing Point, Lord, Alarum, Black Majesty, Eyefear, Voyager and many more. 

In early 2009 the band released their debut album 'Duality' followed by an Australian East Coast headline tour in March to promote the CD. Since the album's release the band have received a solid amount of radio play and multiple showings of their debut film clip 'Take The Plunge' on RAGE, ABC TV. 

In 2009 Darker Half toured the east coast of Australia with Iron Maiden's original vocalist Paul Di'anno and did a full national tour supporting progressive metal legends Queensryche.
