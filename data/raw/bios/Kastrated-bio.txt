Kastrated is  a Brutal Death Metal from Burnley, UK. They formed in the year 2004 by Chris (Vocals), Tom (Guitar), Kenny B (Guitar), Al (Bass) and Smith (Drums, with Reth) and released a demo a year later called "The putrid stench of cum filled infants". Later the band collaberated on a 3-way split called "North-west Slam Fest" released in 2007 by Grindethic Records, with Ingested and Crepitation.

Now, with a new bassist (Matt, also guitarist of Reth) they are pulling out of gigging and are writing new material for a debut full-length album to be released late 2008/2009.
