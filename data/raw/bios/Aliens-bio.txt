Aliens NOT PICTURED! (pictured is British band The Aliens) are a band from Austin, TX. Aliens' first "real" studio recordings were done in 2002, at the home of Virginia Tate. They were recorded on the original "Noise New York"  board used extensively by Kramer, The legendary and elusive producer and founder of Shimmy Disc Records.  Later Karmer would master ALIENS debut album, Head First which was released on the MISC. MUSIC label.  Head First has gained strong reviews and comparisons to SONIC YOUTH, FUGAZI, R.E.M., NIRVANA, and even HAWKWIND.  Head First was in the CMJ Top 200 this past summer and has created some attention for this underground band.  ALIENS toured the United States in July and August and continue to move forward releasing two videos for songs on Head First recently.  These videos are for Moving Parts and Reflex Motor.

ALIENS are from Austin, Texas and are not to be confused with THE ALIENS, the former Beta-Band from the UK.  ALIENS (US) have been using the name since 2002.
