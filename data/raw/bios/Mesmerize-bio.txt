It was way back in 1988 that Andrea Garavaglia (drums), Piero Paravidino (guitar), Folco Orlandini (vocals) and Paolo Chiodini (guitar), united by their passion for the great metal bands from that period, such as Iron Maiden, Manowar and Helloween, first formed the group MESMERIZE. 
With the addition of Andrea Tito (bass) in 1994, the line-up was complete. Four albums later (the latest is “Stainless”) and with a wealth of experience playing live, MESMERIZE today is stronger than ever.
Their powerful sound is classic heavy metal enriched with a unique modern twist.

Current line-up:

Folco Orlandini - vocals
Piero Paravidino - guitar
Luca Belbruno - guitar
Andrea Tito - bass
Andrea Garavaglia - drums
