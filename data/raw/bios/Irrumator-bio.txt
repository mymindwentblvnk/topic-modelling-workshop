Irrumator plays a mixture of noise, drone, dark ambient and doom metallish music dragged through a psychofilter. Darkness and anxhiety are the keywords when talking about the music of this group. After five self-published albums/demos the one-man-maniac-machine went on a teeny tiny break but supposedly some new material is on its way.
