OLD WITCH is crushing but atmospheric doom metal shrouded by a dark veil of early 90s black metal feeling. 

The music of dead oak forests, the sound of chilling ghostly nights, 
Canadian OLD WITCH makes sublime ethereal art, but bringing the massive sound, 
making them a strange beast in the current underground.

Debut album "Come Mourning Come" was released in 2014 on Tape by The Arcane Tapes.
