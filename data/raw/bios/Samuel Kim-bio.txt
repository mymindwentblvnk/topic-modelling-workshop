Samuel Kim is a multi-instrumentalist singer/songwriter. His brand of lo-fi indie pop melded with electronica shows his desire to have an open mind and heart when it comes to sound and word. His influences come from a variety of sources: from the minimalist melodic guitar work of Low, the song writing sensibility of David Bazan, to the electronic experimentation of The Notwist. Through his time living in Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom, and now the United States, he has literally acquired a world of sound within his ears. 

He is currently going under his full name of Samuel Joseph Kim.  While he will always embrace his indie-pop past, and much of it can still be heard in his more recent work, he is moving forward in a new direction with his new album entitled "Division" [2008]. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Samuel+Kim">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
