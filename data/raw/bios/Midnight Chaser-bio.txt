Forged in the blast furnaces of Pittsburgh and tempered in the waters of the San Francisco Bay comes a new force in the art of bad ass; enter MIDNIGHT CHASER! Influenced by the gods of 70’s and 80’s hard rock and heavy metal, MIDNIGHT CHASER was originally conceived of by guitarist Stephen Lauck and bassist “Texas” Josh Hunt while both still living in Pittsburgh, the Rust Belt of Pennsylvania. However it wasn’t until both rockers found themselves relocated to the fog cloaked Bay Area of California that MIDNIGHT CHASER began to take shape.

First recruiting the steam hammer drumming skills of Brandon Thomas, the pair immediately knew that they had found the missing piece of their rhythm section
that they had been searching for. All that was lacking now was a voice that could suitably realize their ambitions. Unsatisfied with the pool of vocal talent in their new surroundings they imported fellow Pittsburgh native Scott Atwood in order to fill the final void and complete that which is MIDNIGHT CHASER. The line-up
finally completed, the band whipped themselves into a creative furor, writing and rehearsing original material while playing shows up and down the West Coast,
rocking any venue that would have them from bars and theaters to strip clubs and basements.

Fans of early hard rock and heavy metal such as Judas Priest, Saxon, Motorhead, Fastway and Tank take note! Having completed recording their debut full length album, tentatively scheduled for a February 2011 release on Heavy Artillery Records, Midnight Chaser is now ready to hit the rest of the world like a runaway train.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Midnight+Chaser">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
