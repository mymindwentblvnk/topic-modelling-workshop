The Chairman of Jupiter Society, Carl Westholm, known from other Swedish acts like Carptree and Krux,now releases an epic concept album "First contact//Last warning".

In collaboration with people like Leif Edling (Candlemass, Krux) Mats Levén (Krux, ex Therion, Y. Malmsteen) and Declan Burke (Darwins radio, Frost) among many others, He gives us an album with the ambient but symphonic production known from Carptree and with a clear presence of Heavier elements . Big arrangements, small details, different vocalists and musicians specially chosen for each song makes it divers and intriguing. You are given one hour of music and exclusive artwork, once again by the independent Label FOSFOR Creation

Now in 2009, Jupiter Society releases the sequel called "Terraform" again with a lot of prominent fellow musicians like the last time, slightly different crew this time with Kulle and Marcus Jidell (Royal Hunt) on lead guitars, and Lars Sköld (Tiamat) on Drums and also Christer Jansson (Roxette among many others) on additional Drums. Mats Levén (krux, ex Therion, ex Y.Malmsteen and others) and Leif Edling (Candlemass, Krux) are still members of the society among others.
