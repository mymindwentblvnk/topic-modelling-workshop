The Phoenix specialize in full on bombastic free spirited rock music which pays no attention to rules. They strive to incorporate intellectual depth into their music while having kick ass guitar solos and riffage in addition to multi layered harmonies and grandiose arrangements. But they are not just simply limited to this. They also dare to explore other terrains of music in their quest to break down boundaries. They are first and foremost a band that focuses on the music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Phoenix">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
