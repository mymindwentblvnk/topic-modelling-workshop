Setesh is a one-man extreme metal project from Birmingham, Alabama, formed in 2014 by Edward Schreiber. His music is stylistically diverse, ranging from death, doom and black metal to hardcore punk, gothic rock and more. Lyrics are at times political, personal or facetious and draw inspiration from history, folklore and the occult.

Since 2007, Edward Schreiber has been recording music under numerous pseudonyms and releasing it online to mild acclaim. He formed Setesh in 2014 from a desire to create more harsh, experimental music. Taking the project's name from the Egyptian god of chaos, he began working on Setesh's debut album, "This Demon-Haunted World", which was released on October 13th, 2015. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Setesh">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
