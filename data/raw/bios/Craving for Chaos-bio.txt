Craving for Chaos, an up and coming death metal band from Munich, Germany, who know how to skillfully combine progressive elements with melodic deathmetal.

While the bandâ€™s current incarnation hails from early 2009, Craving for Chaos were previously able to establish themselves as a support act for bands such as Kathaarsys, Seeds of Sorrow, Aborted, Rotten Sound, Napalm Death, Ingurgitate and Here Comes The Kraken.

Their diversity is shown by a TV appearance on the German Kids Network (Ki.Ka), participating in an EU-funded band project and by winning the "Songs Of The Summoned" song contest for the successful computer game "League Of Legends". In May 2012, the first EP "Arising Disorder" (7 tracks, 35 min. running time, jewel case and poster) was released.

Currently, they are working on their first LP, which is planned to be a conceptual piece of work. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Craving+for+Chaos">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
