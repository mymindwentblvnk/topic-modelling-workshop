Blood of the Black Owl is a Black/Funeral Doom Metal project of Chet Scott (Ruhr Hunter, The Elemental Chrysalis, Triage, Your Cell: Yourself). He combines a raw style of Black/Funeral Doom Metal with atmospheric parts more akin to his other projects. 


"Chet W. Scott has outdone himself again. His third album, designed to act as a latter-day cleansing ritual, is so abrasive & cathartic, you can't help but wonder what he thinks we've done wrong. In a crepuscular arboreal lair, a spider has hung all the metal posesions of its victims by threads of silk, so they clatter together in the breeze. Nameless Lovecraftian things bang out rythems on petrified tree stumps. Distant Gregorian Monks too afraid to enter the forest chant, & then the guitars kick in for one moment of sweet relief before solipsistic ruminations of sin find voice in Tuvan throat singing...Brilliant!" ~ (Metal Hammer)
