"Orphans of Doom are Jeremy Isaacson (bass/vocals), Bryan Sedey (guitar), and Greg Koelling (drums). 

Since the summer of 2016, Orphans of Doom have been writing sludgy, trashy, proggy, doom-laden riffs simply to please themselves. 

Now, it's 2018 and the release of their debut album Strange Worlds/Fierce Gods marks a new focus of bringing their riffs and soundscapes to the masses.” –some asshole <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Orphans+Of+Doom">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
