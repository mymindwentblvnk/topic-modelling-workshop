Hermano formed in 1998 as a side project and in doing so became a mini super group in stoner rock circles. The original lineup consisted of vocalist John Garcia (Kyuss, Unida, Slo Burn), bassist Dandy Brown (Orquesta del Desierto), drummer Steve Earle (Afghan Whigs) and guitarists Mike Callahan (Earshot, Disengage) and David Angstrom (Banger, Supafuzz, Black Cat Bone, Devil May Care).

The band released Only a Suggestion on Teepee Records in 2002. In 2004 they signed to Dutch label Suburban Records (to date they have been more successful in Europe than North America) and released Dare I Say without Mike Callahan or Steve Earle, the latter replaced by new drummer Chris Leathers (Supafuzz). They have since recruited additional vocalist Aleah X (Banger, Devil May Care, Candy Says). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hermano">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
