Stellastarr* are an American Indie rock band based in New York City. The band is composed of: Shawn Christensen (vocals, rhythm guitar), Amanda Tannen (bass, vocals), Arthur Kremer (percussion, keyboards) and Michael Jurin (lead guitar, vocals).

The group formed in March 2000 from the ashes of a previous musical effort - Ghistor - formed by Shawn, Amanda, and Arthur while studying art and design at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn. A few years later, after a chance meeting with Michael, who had recently relocated to Brooklyn from his hometown Philadelphia, the former classmates reunited, this time with Shawn on vocals.

Stellastarr* played their first gig at the Luna Lounge on the Lower East Side of Manhattan in July 2000 and began releasing a limited series of independent/homemade CDEPs shortly after. To date, they have toured with Jane's Addiction, The Raveonettes, Placebo, The Killers and The Subways, among others.  

Stellastarr*'s second album, entitled Harmonies for the Haunted, was released in America on September 13, 2005.  Their third album Civlized was released in 2009 and proved to be their last. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/stellastarr%2A">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
