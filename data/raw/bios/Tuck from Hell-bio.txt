TUCK FROM HELL, the Swedish metal band featuring drummer Nils Fredrik Johansson — son of LION'S SHARE/ASTRAL DOORS singer Nils Patrik Johansson — will release its debut album, "Thrashing", on January 25, 2011 via Metalville Records.

In 2007, five young metalheads decided to join forces in a band to create some serious metal in the Bay Area thrash style. The band quickly earned a reputation of being a wild live unit and soon the fan base increased. Their fans call themselves "Tuckers" and wherever TUCK FROM HELL performs, the "Tuckers" are there in the pit.

In 2008 they went to the Darkside, the studio run by Martin Haglund, formerly of ASTRAL DOORS. There they recorded a four-track demo entitled "Barbeque Beast". It received great reviews in many European metal magazines, including Sweden Rock.

The year 2009 saw the band once again playing a ton of live shows. They were support act to bands like ASTRAL DOORS, HELLFUELED and LION'S SHARE and also had a successful headlining run of their own. Later that year, TUCK FROM HELL started writing new songs. Bay Area thrash was still their main influence, but they wanted to bring something new to the genre: strong and catchy sing a long choruses.

January 2010, the guys, all born 1988, entered Darkside studio once again to record their debut album. Three months later they came out with a debut album that is sure to be a favorite for metal heads across the globe,.

Led by Johansson, the charismatic singer Niclas Ingels, guitar wiz kid Petrus Granar, insane rhythm guitarist Polo Bengts and bass player Tomas Sonesson, TUCK plans on dominating the thrash scene for many years to come. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tuck+from+Hell">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
