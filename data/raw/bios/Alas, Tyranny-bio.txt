Welcome to the official Last.fm page of the symphonic metal band Alas, Tyranny.  Alas, Tyranny was created in 2007 as the solo project of Matt Parsons after his previous band Sacrosanct broke up.  Alas, Tyranny released the self-titled debut in 2008, and proceeded to play live over the next year while Matt developed the first full length album "Domination Liberation Purification," which was finally released in early 2010.  More live shows followed, but the band's performances was cut short by the departure of Katie Cornell (vocals, DLP) and Joey Marmorato (bass).  

While Matt was recording DLP, he wanted to write and release an EP of darker, heavier music.  "Monolithic" was the result of this pursuit, which ended up growing into a nearly full length release.  Due to technical and personal issues, Monolithic was released in March 2012 as a demo version with an announcement regarding how Alas, Tyranny would be releasing music in the future.  Instead of releasing compilations of songs at long intervals, individual songs would be released with a much quicker frequency.   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Alas,+Tyranny">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
