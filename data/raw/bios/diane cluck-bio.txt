Diane Cluck has been performing her original brand of intuitive folk around New York City and the wider world since 2000.

On her website, http://dianecluck.info, she has been releasing brand new songs directly to subscribers in her fan-funded "Song-of-the-Week" project, and she continues to introduce new songs through her live performances.

Stylistically, her voice has been compared to "the broken coo of an outraged owl or howling bark of a horny dove" (Voodoo-Eros).  Her songs have been noted for their "irregular, or even cellular, logic" (Other Music).  Her self-taught guitar style, influenced by years of playing the piano, has been described by The Village Voice as “brilliant” and “idiosyncratic.” Known for oblique vocal harmonies on recording, Diane’s live show focuses on singing as a healing, textural experience, leaving space in which listeners may wander, ponder or simply be.

Diane’s six home-recorded albums have received international distribution and acclaim; songs from “Oh Vanille / ova nil” (re-released on vinyl in 2010) appeared in the film “Margot at The Wedding” and the U.K. television series “Skins.” She has toured the U.S., U.K. and Europe, and often works with versatile cellist Isabel Castellvi, and cellist Isabel Castellvi.
