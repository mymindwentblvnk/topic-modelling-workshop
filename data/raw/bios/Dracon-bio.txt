Dracon is a electronica and downtempo artist based in Luxembourg.

With eclectic instrumentation, ambient textures and evocative melodies, Dracon’s
spellbinding first album ‘Hope’ was released in early 2020. His second album, ‘Journey’, is
currently in the pipeline and is due for release towards the end of the year.

Dracon first started making music as part of his personal search for peace and tranquility.
Soon, he began sharing his creations to see if they could affect or inspire other people.
The electronica producer says: “In these turbulent times, calming, relaxing music seems
to be one way to cope - it’s my way of helping people in the world.”

Creatively influenced by artists like Emancipator and Bonobo, Dracon finds that listening
to brilliant music made by fellow musicians inspires him to produce his own unique
material: ”Whenever I hear great music, I feel moved to create something equally as
great. It's mainly curiosity. It’s an internal curiosity, or perhaps a personal challenge, to see
if I can actually accomplish a sound as vivid as they can.”
