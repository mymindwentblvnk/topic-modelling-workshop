It all began in November 2007, when the two friends Alexandra Trzoska (guitar) and Evelina Åström (ex basist) decided to start a Death Metal band. They hooked up with Emma Janze (guitar) and Johanna Lindqvist (vocals). They had a temporary drummer for a while until they found a talented 12-year old Wille Sjöberg. After some circumstances Evelina left the band. At this time, in the summer of 2008, Death Maze got an offer to be the soundtrack to a local skate movie. So Death Maze quickly recorded their song "Cries of the past". They started searching for a new bass player, when they found Nilas Frykholm, which led to a goodbye after playing together about a year.
They are at the moment searching for a permanent bass-player.
Death Maze ended up in Wille’s basement starting making new songs, and gradually they were having more live performances. About 4 months later they recorded the demo "Prodigy of Death".
In February 2009 Death Maze got to play at House of Metal, a festival in their hometown Umeå which of course was an honor.
And here we are now, 4 friends that have a passion to make music together. Thanks for all the kind words from other bands and people! We truly appreciate it! It makes us really happy and excited to do better and better!
