Biography
After having played together in various extreme bands for over a decade, Fack (ex-Yyrkoon, ex-Drowning, ex-Decline Of Humanity, ex-Burgul Torkhaïn, ex-Ashura...) and Brédin (Decline Of Humanity, ex-DSK, ex-Tridus Elasticus, ex-Altered Beast...) decided to form a more extreme project of their own late 2010. Infected Society was born.

Focusing on a very fresh blend of old-school Napalm Death, scum era, meets modern grindcore, Infected Society has recorded what can be felt at the first listen as being a totally straight-ahead grindcore debut MCD but which, for the lover of the genre, will prove being more diverse, fresh and catchy than most of all the copycats releases of an over-populated scene nowadays, adding fastcore, hardcore and thrash influences to their blasting madness.

Mastered at the famous Walnut Groove studio ran by ex-Carnival In Coal member, Alex, the, as of now yet untitled, debut MCD, first release of the multi-album deal signed with KAOTOXIN records, will be released early May through KAOTOXIN records to coincide with a set of gigs Infected Society is to play with ex-Drowning members and friends: France's dark doom masters Eibon.

Description
Furious Grindcore with old-school influences reminding of the early heroes but with a very up-to-date feel...
