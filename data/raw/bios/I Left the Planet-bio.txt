Recorded on analogue 16-track tape in March 1996, I Left the Planet is a one-off project featuring members from Fleurety and Ved Buens Ende; two of the most iconic avant-garde bands within black metal. Lyrics and voice are courtesy of acclaimed Norwegian author and novelist Bjørn Esben Almaas, overlaying three separate pieces of music written by Alexander Nordgaren, also handling guitars on the recording. Combined with Ayna Beate Johansen’s distinctive voice, Czral’s legendary drums and percussion style, Per Amund Solberg’s contrapuntal bass melodies and Mari Solberg’s jazzy saxophones the result is different from any other band of the era. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/I+left+the+planet">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
