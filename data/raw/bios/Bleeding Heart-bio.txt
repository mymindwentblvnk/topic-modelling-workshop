Formed in the summer of 2000, Bleeding Heart is a four-piece brutal metal/hardcore band straight outta Nummela, Finland. Since their first two-song demo the songs have been getting on the darker, more violent and metallic side of hardcore, which have been compared to the likes of Kickback, Irate, All Out War and so on. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bleeding+Heart">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
