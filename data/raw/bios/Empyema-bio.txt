Hungarian band called 'EMPYEMA' was officially born in 2001 in the county of Komárom-Esztergom, with drummer Imre Szamos, bass player Roland Kovács, guitarist László Garami and vocalist István Kovács. (For about a half year, second guitarist Gábor Borhídi joined them, but separated after realizing he is better in other kinds of music).

They released a demo, called 'FIRST' with 6 songs (instead of the planned 4). The record name was chosen because it was their first release, and because this is also the name of their favourite track on this material.

The band doesn't really like and can fix themselves into genres. But of course some influenses can be heard in their music.

In 2004 'SOULGRINDERS' was released with 8 tracks, which contained more melodic parts together with the same old harder stuff.
They are touring ever since.
