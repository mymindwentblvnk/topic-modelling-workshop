The Gardnerz is a doomy death metal band from the south of Sweden, the band was formed in the middle of 2008 by Wilhelm. In late 2008 Francisco joined the band and our debut album started to take shape. A long time friend of Francisco, Juan Pablo, was recruited to do the drums and after a long time of searching for a vocalist Niclas stepped in to the picture. After about two years of slowly putting the pieces together we can finally present the finished product - The System of Nature.
