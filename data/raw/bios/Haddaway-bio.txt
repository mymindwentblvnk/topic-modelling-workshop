Haddaway (born Nestor Alexander Haddaway on January 9, 1965 in Trinidad) is a Eurodance/House musician. Born into a local family, his mother was a local nurse, and his father, a Dutch oceanographer. He completed a doctorate in political science and history from George Washington University in Washington DC, before moving to Cologne, Germany, in 1989. He presently lives in Kitzb√ºhel, Austria.

Haddaway's biggest hit, "What Is Love," became very popular across Europe (reaching #2 in the UK), North America and Australia after its 1993 release. Follow-up single "Life" was a big U.S. and European dance hit. His debut album spawned two more European hit singles: "I Miss You" and "Rock My Heart." His 1995 album included two minor hits, but his later releases went by largely unnoticed.

"What Is Love" has been re-mixed and re-released dozens of times. The track had a resurrection in popularity following a prominent role in a Saturday Night Live skit, which later became the 1998 film A Night at the Roxbury.

Haddaway appeared on the Comeback reality television show in Germany in 2003. He appeared on a similar UK show, Hit Me Baby One More Time, in 2005 and subsequently appeared on the U.S. version of the show.

In July 2005, he released a new single called "Spaceman" and album called Pop Splits in Germany where he has a very strong following of fans. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Haddaway">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
