11) A Japanese visual kei band formed in 1998, the group went on to release a few demos throughout 1999 and 2000, and later released a few singles from 2000 through 2001 as well. By the summer of 2001, Bishop managed to develop a small cult following for their industrial-fused sound, and the group ended up touring a bit more throughout 2001, although they eventually ended up abruptly disbanding in 2002. The only member of Bishop who remained active in the visual scene was bassist Junzo, who went on to join the cult visual group Feathers-Blue, although he later left Feathers-Blue in 2004. He then joined the visual group Run Jewelry, which was active for less than a year. Junzo then joined the indies group Dust Co., Ltd, which also mysteriously disintegrated in 2008. After Dust Co., Ltd's short run, Junzo then retired from the visual scene. In 2015, Dust Co., Ltd suddenly reunited, and the group toured throughout the majority of the year and some of 2016, before suddenly disappearing once more. It can be presumed that Dust Co., Ltd have since disbanded a second time, and Junzo then returned to his retirement. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bishop">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
