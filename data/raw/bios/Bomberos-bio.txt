There are three bands called Bomberos:

1) Grindcore band from Italy, formed in 2001

2) Norwegian punk rock band:

Bomberos were formed in 2002 by Bjørn Hinkel - guitars, Joacim Weibull - bass, Sven-Erik ‘Maniac’ Kristiansen (Mayhem) - vocals and Einar ‘Beinhard’ Sjursø - drums, to play obscene and disgusting punk, inspired by bands like Misfits, The Dead kennedys and Nine Pound Hammer. The fourpiece quickly gained reputation as a truly chaotic live-act and their debut 7”ep ‘Bringing Down the Neighbourhood Average’ was released January 2003 on Duplicate.
A fist in the face of wanna-be H&M punks and poseur rockers, the ep portrays the band as subway station bums, singing about filthy women and nasty men and has received praises in the Oslo rock underground.
March 2004 sees the release of Bomberos’ second offering; seven tracks of hate and disgust on cd and vinyl, aptly named ‘Hate’. The expression is more diverse, and the delivery more intense than before, bordering on metal and rock as Bomberos pummel their way through your speakers. Pete ‘Evil’ Vegem, formerly of defunct rock band Hellride, and Bård ‘Faust’ Eithun, of Emperor-fame, have recently joined the ranks, replacing Joacim and Beinhard on bass and drums respectively.
