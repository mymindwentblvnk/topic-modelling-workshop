Crux Infernum is a one man Black Metal project, formed by Rahovart (also known as H. from Dim Aura) in the year of 2004.

Heavily influenced by Raw Black Metal and dark classical compositions, Rahovart decided to write music that would be melancholic and depressive to the max. Mainly Influenced by artists such as Judas Iscariot, Nargaroth, Gorgoroth, and Ludwig van Beethoven.

Most of Crux Infernum's lyrical themes discuss melancholy,depression of the human mind,and general hatred towards all. Rahovart chooses not to publish the lyrics to his songs because of their personal meanings.

Crux Infernum stands for the destruction of humanity as we know it.
