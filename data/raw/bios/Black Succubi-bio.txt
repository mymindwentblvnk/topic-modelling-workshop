Black Succubi was formed in Copenhagen, Denmark in 2005 with a back-to-the-roots agenda of composing and performing the essence of hard and heavy rock'n'roll: Crushing guitars, thundering drums, pounding bass and powerful vocals supported by catchy harmonies and bluesy guitar solos. The five members of Black Succubi trusts the music on their debut album to be a grooving and efficient mix of heavy riffing and melodic hard rock hooklines. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Black+Succubi">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
