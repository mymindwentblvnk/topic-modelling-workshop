SotM hail from the forbidding environs of Dushanbe, Tajikistan, where their uncompromising mongrelization faced severe oppression within a culture even more harsh and mysterious than that of northern Europe. Taking advantage of a sister-city agreement entered into by both municipalities during the height of Soviet imperialism, our heroes relocated sometime in the early second millennium to the mountain hamlet of Boulder, Colorado, nestled majestically among the foothills of middle America's ancient Rocky Mountains.

SotM's debut demo was recorded in Fall 2004 and they have performed the Xylophobic ritual at select Colorado venues. A new recording was begun in March 2005 and was released in 2008 as a part of "Samtliche Werke," the band's definitive statement.
