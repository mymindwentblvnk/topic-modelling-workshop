There are several different artists named Calm: 
1) A Japanese ambient electronica project by Kiyotaka Fukagawa (深川清隆). Active since 1997.
2) An American nu-metal band (ex-Seeded Crown)
5) A hip hop duo consisting of Time (Raps) and AwareNess (Beats). 
3) A Swedish 6-piece experimental/nu metal band based in Stockholm. 
4) A Romanian rock band, still underground but quickly making a name for themselves. 
5) A hip hop duo consisting of Time (Raps) and AwareNess (Beats).
6) A mid-90's post-hardcore band featuring members of Mohinder.
Just after Mohinder and right before Duster, Calm surfaced in the mid-’90s to feed on the wage-depressed suburban Gen-X malaise. The trio of Clay Parton, Dove Amber, and Albert Menduno criss-crossed the west coast DIY scene by the time of their final recordings, “Moonraker” b/w “Scienists and Sabatuers,” etched at Mountain View’s Trainwreck Studios by noted sludge documenter Tom Yates. More metal than emo, Calm’s last record is nine-minutes of ear-bleeding racket from a couple of future spacewalkers.

7) A Psychedelic Death Metal band from Poland

The Swedish band recently released their second album for free on their website, with all songs available for download. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Calm">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
