Started in September 2008, by two friends, Dave Daniel (guitar/vocals) and Chip Fay (drums), who both had a love for metal. Zach Rice joined the band on guitar soon after. After several line up changes, Zach Holme took up keyboards, and Chris Hickman picked up the bass. Varied influences from the members leads to a mix of black, thrash, and melodic death metal. We are always looking for shows, so be sure to let us know if you are interested!
