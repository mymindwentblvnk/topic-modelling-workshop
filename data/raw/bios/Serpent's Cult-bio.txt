Serpent’s Cult, from Sterzing, South Tyrol, Italy, was founded in 2006 for want of the two guitarists Horn and Lupus, with the aim of creating a band to be radically different from their past experience with other groups. After about an year spent in completing the line-up, they were first joined by Sarg on the bass and then by Vipera on the keyboards (replacing the keyboardist who had left after few months). The line-up was completed by Waldläufer, not as guitarrist (his first instrument) but as drummer. After some months of constant rehearsals aimed to consolidate the group, to create their own style and to write songs.
In March 2008 the band records a first demo limited to 100 copies (still available, contact us if you’re interested), hand- numbered.
Serpent’s Cult play a fast aggressive Black Metal with epic influences which keyboards contribute to enrich, creating grim evocative atmospheres. The band is currently working on promoting their first demo and is preparing to record a new one with the new tracks written during the past year.
