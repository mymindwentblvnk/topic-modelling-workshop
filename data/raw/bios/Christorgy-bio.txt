Christorgy is a one man Black/Grind/Stupiditycore band from Enniskillen,Northern Ireland and is the creation of Tiberius Nyarlethotep.Christorgy began in 2006 after the implosion of the universally ignored Toilet Problems.First ep "Drugs We Didnt Pay For" was released soon afterwards,and was given out for free at gigs and festivals around Ireland.around 300 copies of this release were made.2nd ep "Bring me the head of Aynseley Harriot" was released in 2008 and has found its way round the world with various DIY distros and Mail Order.a 3rd very limited release incorporating both the first eps and a collection of demos utilising the talents of various Irish underground musicians (On Pain Of Death,Sorrowfall,Darkest Era) as vocalists and guitarists.
It must be stated that the first releases are of suspect quality and are little more than demos.Tiberius Nyarlethotep has stated that his music is "ruining metal for everyone"
New ep "Eaten by angry vegans" is a step up in production values and actually has audible riffs and lyrics. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Christorgy">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
