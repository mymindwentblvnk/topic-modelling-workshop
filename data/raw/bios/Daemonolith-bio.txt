The video were linked to on the right is by Algazanath and has nothing at all to do with us. We had the band name before that song was done so were linked to it.

Daemonolith was originally formed by Bismark (Guitar/Bass) & Salachar (Guitar/Drum machine) in 1998.

They threw together some demo tracks over the years but due to various complications they never managed to get a proper line-up. This was mainly due to the lack of people with the correct mentality, the restrictions of a black metal drummer & total alcoholism.

Towards the end of 2005 Kasgradh was recruited to play guitar for Daemonolith with Bismark on bass & Alcodemon on guitar. Ronue (Ex-Ravencult) joined ranks shortly after as drummer.

Rehearsals began which lead to the first two Daemonolith songs being composed. The Arrival & Under The Dead Skies Of Alba. The next step was to find someone to perform vocals.

Differed vocalists were tried out. Bismark & Kasgradh also thought about performing vocals for the band but realised that it would interfere with them playing their instruments. In early 2006 Seelenfresser proved to be the correct vocalist for Daemonolith.

Shortly after the first demo was recorded “Dead Skies Of Alba”.

In September 2007 Bismark replaced Kasgradh & Witch King took over to play bass for a brief period while Kasgradh was commited to a psychiatric hospital.

In February 2008 Kasgradh returned to the band playing bass in time for the recording of the “By Order Of Decimation” album which resulted in Daemonolith being signed to Darkland Records.

After some inner strife in the band Kasgradh once again leaves the band in July 2009 and at this point long term supporter and guitarist Kirk from the Glasgow Black/Thrash band Achren joins as the new bassist.
