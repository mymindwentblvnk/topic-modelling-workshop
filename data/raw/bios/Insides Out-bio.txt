(2)starting in January of 2008.
Altogether these 3 goons have been playing since 2003. They started with the name Stichid, then in 2004 Wolf moved to FL and played with The Rival Heroes, and started Silence Of Salem (07). Meanwhile back in NC, Skum and Casket kept playing under the name The Vacants (05-06). When Wolf moved back to NC in Nov. of 2007, the 3 got together and began playing again. By the time January of 2008 came around they decided that horror punk is something they truly and purely wanted to do more than anything. So they got up with George Gill at Myrtle Beach Recording, and thats when the horror began..
