Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five were one of the first hip-hop groups to come out of NYC in the late 70s early 80s. Backed primarily by the Sugar Hill house band early on, the group wrote party-friendly anthems. At the same time, they gained noteriety thanks to socially conscious singles like "The Message" or "White Lines (Don't Do It)". Broke up after Melle Mel decided he was the real Grandmaster. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Grandmaster+Flash+and+the+Furious+Five">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
