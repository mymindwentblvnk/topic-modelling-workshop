Paul "Tchan Tchou" Vidal (1923 â€“ 1999, born in Aix-en-Provence, France) is the most respected musician of the 'Southern' school of Gypsy guitar playing. Unlike Django who was a Manouche or Sinti Rom, Tchan-Tchou was from the Gitane tribe, which has roots in Spain; hence, his music had a strong flamenco influence. He also absorbed other Mediterranean influences, most notably Corsican folk music. 

Tchan-Tchou's strong point was boleros, waltzes and folk tunes such as "Les Deux Guitares" and "Les Yeux Noirs". His most famous composition is the waltz "La Gitane". It is a stunning display of virtuosity that has become a test piece for all aspiring Gypsy guitarists. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tchan+Tchou+Vidal">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
