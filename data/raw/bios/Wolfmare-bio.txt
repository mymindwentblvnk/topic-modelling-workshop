The band WOLFMARE was founded in 2002 in St. Petersburg, Russia by ex-members of local metal and folk projects. The band plays folk metal, but their creativity is too strong to lock it in frames of one genre. Many shades and influences of black metal, doom metal and even the 70′s rock were added to the folk metal base and make the unique WOLFMARE sound. The most of lyrics are in English, but some traditional songs in other languages are also performed.
WOLFMARE has recorded four studio albums. The first one titled “Widdershins” was released in 2004 at a local Russian label, as “Whitemare Rhymes” (2008) and “Hand of Glory” (2010) were released by the CCP Records, Austria.
Now it’s time to show another face of WOLFMARE. New album called "The Sacred Mushroom and the Crows" is released by the SoundAge label, Russia. Its slogan is “Back to the roots”, not only the band’s roots but also the roots of the folk and metal music. WOLFMARE are never the same, more voices, more sounds, and more surprises are waiting for the audience anytime. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wolfmare">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
