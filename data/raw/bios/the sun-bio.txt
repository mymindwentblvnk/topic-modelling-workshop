There are various artists that go by the name of The Sun.

1.) The Sun (USA) is a indie rock band from Columbus, OH. They released their first full-length album “Blame It on the Youth” in June 7, 2005 on DVD. Every song has a music video. The disc also has WAV files on it for listening without viewing the videos. While it claims to be the first DVD album, it is not a new idea. There were a few albums in the 1980s that had a video cassette release in the same vein.  The band gained Internet exposure through their music video for the song “Romantic Death,” which featured footage (from Beautiful Agony) of people’s faces while having orgasms.

Band members: Chris Burney (vocals, guitar), Sam Brown (drums), Bryan Arendt (guitar), Brad Forsblom (bass, backing vocals) and Brad Caulkins (keyboard, guitar, backing vocals).
