the ̀an ́dric (thė ̀ǎn ́drĭk):  a. 1. Relating to, or existing by, the union of divine and human operation in Christ, or the joint agency of the divine and human nature

THEANDRIC is a melodic metal band based out of Detroit, Michigan.  
The vision for the band began in 2006 when THEANDRIC mainman Paolo Tiseo began to envision a musical project that would fuse his two loves: melodic and aggressive heavy metal combined with the rich tradition of sacred music.  The band’s influences range from renowned metal bands such as Iron Maiden, Megadeth and Sepultura, to sacred music composers such as Messiaen, Palestrina, Bach and Vivaldi.

THEANDRIC’s goals for the future include the completion of a full-length album in 2012, international performances, and building a strong connection with fans of heavy music worldwide.

The name THEANDRIC was chosen for the band as it can refer to the harmony of Christ’s human and divine nature, but also to refer to our humble human efforts to cooperate with God in the creative process.
