Despistado was a Canadian indie rock band from Regina, Saskatchewan, who were active from 2001 to 2004. The band consisted of vocalist and guitarist Dagan Harding, guitarist Leif Thorseth, bassist Joel Passmore and drummer Brenan Schwartz.

Despistado released their first EP, The Emergency Response, in 2002; it was subsequently rereleased in 2004 on Jade Tree Records. Widely hyped as a "next big thing", the band's single "A Stirstick's Prediction" was used in a commercial for T-Mobile. After a cross-Canada tour in the summer of 2004 which reportedly left the band exhausted and riven by personal tensions, they returned home to prepare for an international tour in the fall; due to family obligations, Passmore declined to participate in the fall tour and was temporarily replaced by Robin Sernich. On that tour, the interpersonal dynamics within the band continued to deteriorate, and by Christmas the band had broken up. Their full-length album The People of and Their Verses, completed before the band's breakup, was subsequently released on Jade Tree in 2005.

Passmore is currently in the band Sylvie; Harding and Thorseth are in a band called Geronimo; Schwartz plays with Anatta. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Despistado">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
