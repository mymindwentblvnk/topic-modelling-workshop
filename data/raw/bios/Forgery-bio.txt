Forgery is a four piece band that hails from the early 90’s thrash scene in Oslo, Norway.
They had a break for a decade and re-emerged with a new drummer in 2002.
After finding a second guitarist and yet a new drummer the line up was complete and they started playing gigs around Norway.
Forgery are:
Anders Moen- guitars/vocals
Morten Steen- bass
Jan Roger Halvorsen- drums
Ronny Hansen- guitars
2009 they released their debut album called Harbouring Hate, through Nocturnal Art Productions/ Candlelight records.
More concerts and touring followed until the fall of 2012 when they hooked up with Battlegod Productions on the “Thrash ‘till Death” tour and the album “With These Fists” was released a year and a half later.
The band is yet again in road-mode and ready to break necks where ever they go.
