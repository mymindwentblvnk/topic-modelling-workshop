Rise of Caligula began in late 2006 and released their debut LP 'Parading From Heaven's Descent' in October 2009.

"At its core “Parading From Heaven’s Descent” is a compelling fixture in modern metal. Threading as it enthralls its listeners into the darkest and loneliest paths of life. Captivating and brutal all in one breath, it’s easy to say that Rise of Caligula speaks as one of the loudest voices in underground metal. Nihilistic in theory and apocalyptic in nature, this is the answer to the flashy metal bands. This is about as legit as it gets."
