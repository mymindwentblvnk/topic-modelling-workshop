In 2004 they released an EP titled "Stronger, Perfect Promo 04" containing the first 4 tracks of the actual LP, that was well appreciated by the media, even because the usage of flutes in metal,  psychedelic guitars , great atmospheric keyboards and organs over a rocky bass and a powerful drumming was something pretty new in prog metal. 

After some minor gig they played in 2005 in Lecco Art Lab, a prog festival featuring Mauro Pagani (PFM), David Jackson (Van Der Graaf Generator) Rodolfo Maltese (Banco Del Mutuo Soccorso). 

They Entered the studio from early May to late June 2006 to self produce their debut album for AMS/BTF/VINYLMAGICdistribution.
