Past Lives is a band from Seattle, Washington. The band formed out of the breakup of The Blood Brothers in late 2007.

Vocalist Jordan Blilie, bassist Morgan Henderson, and drummer Mark Gajadhar joined with original Blood Brothers guitarist Devin Welch and started working almost immediately on their debut EP . Strange Symmetry was released on August 4, 2008 through Suicide Squeeze. It was initially a digital-only release with a limited run of physical CDs, but was later made more widely available on CD and vinyl.

Around the same time, the band was also featured in The Journal of Popular Noise, releasing a limited vinyl EP alongside other artists. The EP can also be downloaded from the band's official website.

A Myspace blog posted on November 17, 2009 detailed the forthcoming album, Tapestry of Webs. It will be released on February 23, 2010 by Suicide Squeeze. The post includes a full tracklisting and says that the title is taken from a painting by Ryan Iverson who agreed to let the band use the image for the album cover. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Past+Lives">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
