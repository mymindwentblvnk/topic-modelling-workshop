Ex Reverie was a project by American folk musician Gillian Chadwick (lead guitarist for Golden Ball and collaborator in Woodwose and Rusalnaia).

The debut, and only, album is The Door Into Summer released in 2008. It features the production and musical collaboration of Greg Weeks and his wife Jessica Weeks and released on their Language of Stone record label. Additional contributors were Ben McConnel, Margie Wienk, Art Difuria and Chadwick's husband, David Chadwick. Chadwick's singing on the album is said to evoke a more sinister Sandy Denny (Fairport Convention), her voice rising like an incantation over the music and then falling back among the flora. Her tonal flexibility allows her to keep up with the fertile evolution of her suites (more than half the songs here exceed five minutes). This evolution carries each song through a distinct musical history loosely rooted in parallel musical histories: that of the stringed instrument, of folk and rock music, and of her own experience as a listener and player. 

Chadwick has also performed with Jessica Weeks as Woodwose, and with Sharron Kraus as Rusalnaia, in addition to being a contributing member to the band Golden Ball which she co-founded with her husband. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ex+Reverie">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
