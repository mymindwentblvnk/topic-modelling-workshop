Rivendell (previously known as Fangorn) is a black metal band from Salzburg, Austria, formed in 1998. 
Rivendell music has a strong folk influence. It is a one-man project by Falagar, who released his first demo in 1998 ("Poems of Mountains and Forests"). Since then, 3 albums have been released ("The Ancient Glory" in 2000, "Elven Tears" in 2003 and in 2005 "Farewell - The Last Dawn"), where especially the latest has been reviewed as being in league with bands such as Falkenbach.

The name "Rivendell" refers to an Elven outpost appearing in the book series "The Lord of the Rings" by J.R.R. Tolkien. It is not only the name, but also most of the lyrical themes that have been inspired by the world of Middle-earth.

Falagar also plays in Ahnenstahl.
