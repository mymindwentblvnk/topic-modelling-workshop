After a quick start and hard work is the result after blood, sweat and tears: Tribal Spirits. With a reasonable setlist are Alwin (Vocals), Jory (Lead Guitar), Daan (Drums), Martijn (Guitar) and Wesley (Bass) charging the stages of Holland and beyond.

The fiveheaded unit makes a mix of heavy Metal with influence of: Metallica, Slayer, Lamb of God and lots of other bands. A rough and melodic sound with fast guitarriffs, hard drums and with recognisable vocals. In other words: Heavy Thrash Metal
