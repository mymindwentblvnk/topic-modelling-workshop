Headed up by Tony Tuff and Sugar Minott, the African Brothers formed in 1969 and recorded for Micron Music which was run by Mick Johnson and Ronny Burke of Sunsplash fame. The group later recorded for other producers from the likes of Keith Weston, Winston Blake, Ruffle Edwards and Clement "Coxsone" Dodd. Some of the releases were Lead Us Father, Party Time and Rightous Kingdom just to name a few. The group sprang up from the gatherings at Delacree Road and Delamar Avenue corner, properly known as Tony Martin corner, where many aspiring artists would mass. Due to the strong cultural content of the lyrics the group did not receive the praise it deserved. The African Brothers were one group very much ahead of their time. Around 1974 the group split to pursue solo careers. Tony Tuff and Sugar Minott have now firmly placed themselves in the reggae 'whos who'. ~ Bigupradio

Want Some Freedom was very nearly used by the political Jamaica Labour Party (JLP). This wouldn't have been a good idea when you consider the African Brothers resided in a People's National Party (PNP) stronghold at the time. ~ Daintycrew.com
