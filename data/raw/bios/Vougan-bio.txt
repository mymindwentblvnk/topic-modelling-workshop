Vougan was formed in july 2005 by the musicians Acácio Carvalho, G Zus and Hugo Santiago (ex-Dark Avengers), with the intent to make a type of music really free on the style of the compositions. Still without a keyboard player, Felipe K. (ex-Bad Wolf) was invited to join the project and adpted pretty well on the band´s profile, bringing his influences and combining it into the songs that was being composed.

Even without vocalist, the composing process was being executed by the band. So they invited Carlos Zema(Heaven´s Guardian) to take part on the team and help them to consolide their work.

Finally with the complete line-up, the Vougan entered the studio to record "Silent Souls", a promocional album, to divulgue their work. This album marks the beggining of a new project made by capable musicians, indebted nationa and internationally by the work made on their former bands. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vougan">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
