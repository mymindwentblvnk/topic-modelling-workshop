Sylvatica from Denmark plays melodic death metal, drawing inspiration from folk-metal, thrash and black metal. The music is delivered in a heavy and contrasting atmosphere with neck-b​reaking headbanging passages, aggressive blast beats and strong melodies. 

The band released their debut EP "Sagn og Sagaer" in 2010 which was followed by the EP "Mosem​anden" in 2011. In 2012, the single "Blodrøde Blade" was published and in 2014 the band released their debut full-length album "Evil Seeds". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sylvatica">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
