Low Roar is the project of Ryan Joseph Karazija /kə-RAH-ze-yah/ from San Franciso, California. Formerly of Audrye Sessions (Black Seal), Low Roar is currently based in Reykjavík, Iceland and signed to Tonequake Records 

Low Roar draws from ambient influences, especially on single, "Tonight, Tonight, Tonight," a sultry electro-washed song, recalling late 90's era Radiohead. The album takes the listener on Karazija’s unsettled journey conveying emotion with yearning choruses and haunting strings in simple, yet stark, classical arrangements, alongside optimistic melodies and folk-styled songs. Combining elements of post rock with minimalist tones and sonically aligning with the change and introversion of fall, Low Roar released on November 1st, 2011, by Tonequake Records.

Adding players Júlíus Óttar Björgvinsson and Katie Buckley to the live show, Low Roar slowly reveals a beautiful and powerful set consisting of loops and layers of instrumentation including guitar, harp, pump organ, percussion and keys – at times, a combination capable of evoking tears.
