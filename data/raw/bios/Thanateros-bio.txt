Founded in early 2001 by Ben Richter, Thanateros released its debut album “The First Rite” by September of 2001. After the CD-release Thanateros toured successfully with In Extremo and played lots of concerts and festival-shows.

In 2003 the second album “Circle of Life” was released, on which Thanateros found its own unique style by combining modern rock/metal-music with traditional Celtic-folk, using original instruments like the Fiddle, Uilleann Pipes, Bodhran and Whistle.
In April of 2003 Thanateros made its first successful headliner tour throughout Germany and Austria followed by lots of festival-shows with acts like „Subway to Sally“, „Letzte Instanz“, „Tanzwut“ and „L’ame Immortelle“.

In 2005 Thanateros released its first single “Dirty Old Town” and its third CD “Into the Otherworld” on which the union of modern metal and Celtic folk reached a new level.
After numerous concerts, a successful tour with “Umbra et Imago” and another one with “NFD” (ex-Fields of the Nephilim) Thanateros took a break. During this extended timeout, lasting more than two years the line-up was completely changed and new songs were written.

Then between March and May 2008 Thanateros entered the RedHouseStudio to produce fourth CD entitled “Liber Lux”. The release of the CD is planned for the beginning of April 2009 and will be followed by concerts and festival-shows.
