Absolute Steel is a heavy metal band from Norway. Formed in 1999, the band’s founding members were Andy Boss (lead guitar), Dave Bomb (lead guitar) and K2 (vocals). Throughout the late 1990’s they played live performances and developed a heavy metal party band style that caught the attention of Edgerunner Records, a local heavy metal label. In 2002, the label released "The Fair Bitch Project", the bands debut recording. Performances after the release further defined their style by featuring female strippers and pyrotechnics.

A second Edgerunner release was planned, but the label folded before it could be issued. The recording was self produced and the band printed and distributed 200 copies in an attempt to attract another label. Black Lotus, a Greek label heard the recording and signed the band in 2005. Released as "WomaniZer", the recording was distributed world wide and the label plans on remastering The Fair Bitch Project and releasing that as well. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Absolute+Steel">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
