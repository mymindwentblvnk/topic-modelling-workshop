Unowned was formed in 2004 Spring by Safak OZEL and Can TEKER. Band continued its journey as a two-man-project for 8 months. Then drummer Arda BURHAN joined the band. 

Meanwhile Unowned tried a few bass players but none of them could stay in the band because of their personal reasons.

Unowned recorded a few their songs and released them as a demo named "Alone in the Depths" in 2005. They received positive feedbacks all around the world.

Meanwhile they continued to compose new songs and re-arrange current songs for their latest release named as "Collapse Into The Apocalypse". 

As Can TEKER decided to play keyboards, Hakan YESILYURT joined as the rhythm guitarist and after a while Anil SEVENER joined the band as the bass guitarist.

Now they are getting prepared to move one step further with their new records which they are currently working on.
