Jason Nevins achieved global recognition in 1996 with his production of Run-DMC's "It's Like That", which was released under the title Run-DMC vs. Jason Nevins, reaching the #1 spot in over 30 countries, including the German Top 100 and the UK Top 40 charts. It went on to sell a staggering five million copies. This single also prevented the Spice Girls from reaching the #1 spot in the UK at the time, with their single "Stop", their only #2 single. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Run-D.M.C.+vs.+Jason+Nevins">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
