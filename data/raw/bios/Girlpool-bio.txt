Formed by teenage best friends Avery Tucker and Harmony Tividad in 2013, Girlpool evolved dramatically in a relatively short time frame. The band grew from a sparse drummerless duo on their earlier releases (the self titled EP in 2014, and their 2015 debut album "Before the World Was Big") into something resembling a more traditional indie rock act on subsequent records like 2017's  "Powerplant", and 2019's "What Chaos Is Imaginary", borrowing angst from '90s alternative guitar heroes and lush arrangements and bright harmonies from classic radio pop.
