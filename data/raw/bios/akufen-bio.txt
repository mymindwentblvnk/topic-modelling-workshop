Akufen is the musical pseudonym of Montreal, Canada based artist, Marc Leclair. Leclair makes electronic music that is often described as minimal house, minimal techno, glitch, click hop, or microhouse. Leclair's pseudonym comes from the french word for tinnitus (ringing of the ears), acouph√®ne.
His 2002 album "My Way" introduced his concept of "microsampling", which was essentially a way of using extremely small and short clips of samples he had randomly recorded off of F.M. radio broadcasts as a key musical element.
Leclair has also gone under the pseudonyms Horror Inc., David Scott, Nefuka, and Anna Kaufen. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Akufen">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
