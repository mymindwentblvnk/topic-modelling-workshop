A UK black metal band (formed in Farnborough, Hampshire) who have released two full lengths and three demos. They play furious black metal with a strong emphasis on blast beats, with Anti-Chritian and Pagan lyrics. The band consists of: 
Ewchymlaen - Guitars, Vocals (
Crucem - Bass
Xael - Drums 
An excellent band for fans of extreme blasphemous music that never lets up the agression, without getting boring. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Reign+Of+Erebus">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
