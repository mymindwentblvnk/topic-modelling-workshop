Distant Past is the brainchild of Adriano Troiano. After leaving “Emerald” in 2001, he formed his own group “Evil Eye” the same year. The group featured Alain Curty on guitar and Kaspar Zwirner on drums, two of his school friends. After being disappointed by the direction the band was taking, Troiano opted to drop out his own group, to concentrate on a Studio project, which eventually became Distant Past.

Setting up a studio at his home he contacted a few friends to make his first recording experiences. The fist Album “Science Reality” was finished in 2003.

Right after the completion of this album, Troiano immediately started to work on the follow-up “Extraordinary Indication of unnatural Perception” which was released as a retail CD in 2005. Guest featured Christoph Schafer on guitars (who also worked on the first album) and new singer Reto Guggisberg, next to Zwirner and Curty. The brothers Michael and Thomas Vaucher of “Emerald” also made guest appearances on the Album, which would pave the way for Troiano to return to their band in 2006.

The recording process of the “Alpha Draconis” took shape in 2008. Joining him on his most sophisticated and aggressive work to date were: new drummer Al Spicher (who joined Emerald in 2007) and new singer Angelo Schafer (Remote Lane). Next to Alain Curty (now a Member of Deathflow, along Spicher) and a special appearance of David Luterbacher (Deathflow), the CD features guests Andy Bächler (ex-Emerald / Fühlifliisch), who drums the 13-min Epic “the Serpent” and his Emerald-cohort Michael Vaucher, who returns for yet another melodic Solo.
The newest Distant Past Album proves that this Studio Project has a lot to offer and will be a force to be reckoned with in the future.
