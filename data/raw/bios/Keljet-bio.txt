Keljet is a Dutch Nu-Disco/House collaboration between Koen Mestrum and Teun Pranger from Nijmegen. The project that started in 2009 with remixes from artists like LCD Soundsystem and Temper Trap eventually led to own productions in collaboration with artists like Holychild, AYER, and Pretty Sister. The fusion of funky guitars and uplifting beats makes for a perfect summer soundtrack.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Keljet">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
