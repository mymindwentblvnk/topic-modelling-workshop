Placid Art is an Atmospheric Doom/Death Metal band from Podgorica, Montenegro (former Yugoslavia) which originated 2010. The name of the band represents a metaphor considering the sound of its music. Literally meaning of its name would be "the art of not-being-disturbed". That is, exactly, where the irony lies: the music of this band cannot be described as peaceful and calm, at all. On the contrary, certain sequences are made with a goal to cause a disturbing state of mind. But, after all, to live in a modern society and follow the speed of time passing nowadays is an irony of survival, isn't that right? 

The band are: Nikola Radovic - guitars, bass guitar, classical instruments, programming and vocals
Sonja Milicevic - classical instruments, vocals

 These two people came up with an idea to create the music which would express their own beliefs, thoughts and struggles in its lyrics and aggression of the direction in which the world we live in is going to in its music. On that path, they made their first album entitled "Rainbow Destruction Process" which consists of 9 songs that represent the life in the "Wrath of the Sun" and "In silence... Of the Dark Dawn". 

Placid Art has released their first album under a label of TPG Records from Detroit, Michigan (USA).  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Placid+Art">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
