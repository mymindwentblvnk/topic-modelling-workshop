Absence of God, AoG, or aahwgg, is an American sludge/doom band with black-metal influences comprised of two west Tennessee bands, Curmudgeon (Pinson,Tn death/gore/grind), and It is I! (Dyersburg, TN hardcore/crust/doom). The death-metal style vocals are harsh, low and gutteral, giving AoG a darker sound than traditional doom acts. Lyrically, topics include the eradication of mankind through time-travel, devouring the hearts of current doom bands' members, the murder of god, and it's own members' badassery. 

The band currently has two releases available

the "SunnO))Eater Pre-Demo Demo" available through Heavy Voltage Records; and "93,ooo miles from earth," available through High Density Headache and Heavy Voltage Records <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Absence+Of+God">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
