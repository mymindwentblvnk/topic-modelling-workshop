In mid-2007, Mike O'Hara planned to create a ruthless, slamming, brutal death metal band, far surpassing the boundaries of "slams" and "breakdowns", while also incorporating a "doom metal" influence. So it was at this time Mike had begun recording a short, 6-track demo in a makeshift recording studio basement in West Hempstead on Long Island, New York.

Soo after, a name came along. "SLICEDWITHPRECISION", then some other members. Ian Stevenson (ex-vocalist) and Paul Licht (ex-guitarist). A few months after that, two more members joined as well, Eric Grgas (ex-guitarist) and Jeff Grgas (ex-bassist). The 5-piece planned to play some gigs and record some more tracks.

After a year of ingesting drugs and alcohol, the 5-piece procrastinated heavily and nothing got accomplished but merely a logo, a bunch of practices and a few recordings. However, Mike decided to revive SLICEDWITHPRECISION, but with a new name, and work on things completely by himself as he originally had intended. Now, in the summer of 2009, things are looking up for what is now known as "CORDECTOMY", and some newer recordings will most definitely be posted up soon for y'all to listen to.
