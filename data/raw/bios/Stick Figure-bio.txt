Possessing a unique style of music that combines a creative blend of upbeat roots reggae with the reverberating echoes of dub, comes a man with no limit for his musical abilities. Stick Figure's music is written, recorded, and produced by Scott Woodruff, a young man from Duxbury, MA.

All of Stick Figure's songs are made by recording each instrument separately, layering several tracks on top of one another in unison.

Stick Figure recently relocated to Southern California and has picked up three new members for the live band, Brendan Dane (San Diego) on bass, Todd Smith (San Clemente) on drums and Kevin Bong (San Diego) on keys. All are incredible musicians and are surely a great addition to the Stick Figure sound. The band is currently in the process of recording their first debut album together, expecting to drop this Winter.
