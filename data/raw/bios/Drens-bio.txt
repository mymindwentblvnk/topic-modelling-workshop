Drens is a wild surf punk four-piece from Dortmund, Europe’s capital of mustache style!
While they originally met in late 2017 right after studying sound at university, through a shared love of lo-fi harmonies and halloumi sandwiches, Drens agreed it would be a lot of fun writing songs and going touring in a second-hand van.
Even back then, when others thought it was a clever idea to do a full debut record, the boys decided instead to release 7 singles over the last two years. Critically acclaimed tracks like Hype machine-blog darling ‚No‘, summer hymn ‚Curacao‘ or power punk/ice cream dream ‚HEAT‘ gathered huge followership in and outside all of the West & Gold Coast surf rock scenes one can imagine. So, in the end, the band put all the songs on a mixtape called ‚…sunny side up‘, DIY-released it on CD, cassette and digital and enjoyed some Hawaiian pizza. Strange, isn’t it?

Drens played key festivals like Open Source, Kosmos Chemnitz and Open Flair, got featured in several YouTube sessions, radio shows and playlists such as New Music Friday or Alternative Generation. The band can be described as a mixture of ‘your chest covered in Pacific Ocean sweat’, ‘a couple of drinks last night and the next coming up’ and ‘red bathing shorts’, shaken twice on ice - a gang who never take themselves too seriously.
Support shows for The Murlocs or Le Butcherettes happened in the same vein of fuzzy, surf, lo-fi VCR aesthetics as seen in their videos.
We know, 2020 is already knocking and will be BIG, so you better relax, dude. There will be new music and many more shows…

Have you ever looked up the band’s name in a Spanish dictionary, you sucker? Be polite! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Drens">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
