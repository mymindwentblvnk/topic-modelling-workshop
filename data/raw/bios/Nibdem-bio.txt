Nibdem is a depressive blackmetal band from the Netherlands. In 2003 the band started out as a one-man project by Geert van Mook. In 2004 the band released the demo "Destroy Yourself". In 2005 Daniel Arvidsson joined and in 2006 Nibdem should have released an EP, Forgotten Silence, but due to Mook's lack of interest in the blackmetal scene, it's been cancelled.

In the beginning of 2010, Geert van Mook decided to stop with Nibdem. He stated that he would rather release nothing than the "average" album he was working on. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nibdem">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
