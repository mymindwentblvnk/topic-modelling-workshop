Dying Clarity was born in 1999 under the name of Mordakay by Juan and Jorge using a rithm box to do our music because there was no drummer for Mordakay in those days. This project called mordakay was only a hobbie for Juan and Jorge...nothing serius. Many years later (2003)a friend of us, Armando a guitar player of a local band called "celda negra", decides to start playing drums and joining Mordakay to spent a friendly time with us. We spent more and more time together playing music, so we decided to get a new dimension for the band, we incorporate a bass player called Alfonso (and old friend of the band), we change the name of the band to DYING CLARITY and we start playing in a practice room of music. Many time later we have some problems with many bass players and we stop the project in january 2005. The bands is stopped many months and we find a bassist called Alfredo and we restart the project again, many time later Alfredo leaves the band for pesonal circustances so Juan decided to change 6 string for the four strings and incorporate a new member in our Dying family called Achokarlos. He is a great guitar player from Cartagena (Spain) in july 2006. At the end we are COMPLETED, and now is time to kick all your fucking asses with a neon metal discharge!!!!!!!!!! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dying+Clarity">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
