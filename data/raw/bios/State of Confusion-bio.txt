State of Confusion -I remember how they got their name. I've known this bunch since the early days and it's great to see these home boys still punching it out from the old proving grounds of Boise, Idaho. Finally, after years of playing, they've  released an LP's worth of material, called 6.3 Million Acres with twenty tracks of raw rabble-rousing cranks of lightning-laced fury. the State of Confusion (or S.O.C.) blast is brutal with a quick vibrant exhilaration that stings with a flare of originality, pressing your face up against the wall and kicking your legs out from under you. Glass-shattering hardcore that is crude with harsh production, a bite of metallic edge and insistent in their boisterous approach, S.O.C. have got that early '82 thrash rave feel with a touch of modern speedcore for momentum. Cranking out the piercing vocal duties is Pat Schmaljohn, who spits out a raspy tone, coughing up a little blood as the gang sings numerous back-up choruses. On guitar is brother Scott Schmaljohn who quietly licks away some mean jolts with feverish guitar strumming that has this unique buzztwang sound. The joust continues with original singer Wayne Flower on bass, abducting the strings and garroting out some abrasive plucks. Hidden in the back, throwing the drum sticks down speedily against the skins, is Eric Hansen, rounding off this four-piece onslaught. Bash all this together with a silk-screened cover done by the gang and a few friends and State of Confusion is ready to deal the "brain-crush" card to the world as this thrash blade strikes down hard with young effective endurance. With these guys it's easy to be critical, and there were no blackmail threats, but  S.O.C. pulled it off, now if they could just get out of their state of confusion!- Puszone January 1987 <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/State+of+Confusion">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
