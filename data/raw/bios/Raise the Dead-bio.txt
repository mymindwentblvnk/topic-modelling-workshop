Raise The Dead were formed in August 2004 with one common objective: the resurrection of True British Steel. It wasn't until after various line-up changes, a well received and now long sold-out demo (entitled "Famous Last Words") and a few local shows that the original line-up was forged and set in stone.
RTD began to aquire a name for themselves after numerous successful shows supporting UK and International acts across the breadth of the UK, as well as a short tour of Italy (during January 2006). Soon after the band returned to the UK from Europe, their original and long time drummer departed the band. After continous searches for the right replacement, they settled on the amazing talents of Brad "Dr Feet" Merry, also of Trenchhead.

December 2005 saw the release of the MCD "Hymns Of War" (released on the mighty Thirty Days of Night Records). It came presented in a full colour digipack and contained six tracks of true British steel... "Hymns Of War" was well recieved with rave reviews throughout all the major music magazines. It still stands the test of time even today as a british heavy metal classic.

In October '06 the band decided to call it a day after they recorded the previously unreleased track 'Summon The Plague' due to personal commitments hindering the bands future. After a short career the band had achieved great respect within a scene they helped shape from the start.

It was announced on the 22 July 2009 that they will perform a one-off reunion show in Leeds on 20 December 2009 to celebrate the 5th anniversary of Thirty Days of Night Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Raise+the+Dead">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
