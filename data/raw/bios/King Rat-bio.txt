Their sound is of heart wrenching guitar riffs, soaring melodies and sinewy synth lines strapped to a freight train rhythm section. They are influenced by Led Zeppelin and Queen-style classic guitar rock, the epic soundscapes and emotional punch of Pink Floyd and Jeff Buckley, and the cutting edge experimentalism of Radiohead.
