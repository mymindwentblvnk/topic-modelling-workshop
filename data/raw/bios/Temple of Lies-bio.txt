Formed from a garage stoner rock project called Anaconda in Leicester, UK. Front Man Si Shaw joined the band and with founding guitarist Jon Scranney, the pair set their sights on developing a musical style that would entertain audiences with heavy riffing, bouncy, catchy songs with hard yet clear vocals (ie you can hear the words) somewhere between grunge and metal.

The band was named TEMPLE OF LIES and self-released their first album length recording MONUMENTAL as a demo in 2012. A change of drummer,  Alex Gamble, who joined later in 2014 adding his pounding and groovy metal style to the mix, joined later by Jags on bass in 2017  the band continue to develop their own niche sound. Now with three albums released and tons of as yet unrecorded material, the band eagerly look forward to the musical journey ahead.
