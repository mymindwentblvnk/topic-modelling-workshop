Yuka Honda first met Yoshimi at CBGB's, circa 1993. She went to see the Boredoms, Yuka was blown away by this powerful female drummer! They were friends from that night on and always stayed in touch. A little known fact, but Yoshimi actually played in Cibo Matto on the bands first tour of Japan. Later Yuka lent her talents to Yoshimiâ€™s OOIOO album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Yoshimi+&+Yuka">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
