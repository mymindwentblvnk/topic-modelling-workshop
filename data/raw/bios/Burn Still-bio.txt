Hailing from Tallinn, Estonia, the band started regular rehearsals in January of 2006, quickly establishing themselves in the Estonian metal / hardcore scene with their explosive live sets. Winning band contests and playing at the biggest festivals with big name bands at home, Burn Still are becoming more and more known outside Estonia as well. Performing at Sweden's premium hardcore festival “Deadfest” in 2007, winning a voting contest to be the opening band for Parkway Drive' 2008 Helsinki concert in Finland and with numerous gigs in Latvia under their belt, the five piece are hungering for more havoc on stage and in the pit. 

Bands they have shared the stage with: Parkway Drive (AUS), Soilwork (SWE), Raunchy (DEN), Vader (POL), War From A Harlots Mouth (GER), Angelreich (POL), In Blood We Trust (GER), Six Ft Ditch (UK), Have Heart (US), Ignite (US), Death Before Dishonor (US), and many more.

The original lineup:

Olev Ladva - vocals;
Martin Randalu - guitar;
Taavi Liinak - guitar;
Martin Meisalu - bass guitar;
Sulev Ladva - drums.

Additional vocals by Rainer "Metsakutsu" Olbri
