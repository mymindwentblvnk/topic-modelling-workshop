Pop Levi (born Jonathan Pop Levi in London) is an English singer, multi-instrumentalist, record producer and filmmaker. His career started in Liverpool were he was a founding member, along with Snap Ant and Loka, of Super Numeri, and he has played bass for Ladytron both on record and on tour.

Pop Levi is kinda small and reedy and darkly, hairily handsome, and, far more important, the maker of an odd brand of music that is sort of like a combination of every kind of pop ever heard all at once, yet it manages to stay original.

Pop Levi's career started in the fogs of Liverpool. Somewhere along the line, he got the opportunity to play bass for electronic-rock artists Ladytron, and then the guy who wrote the songs for Ladytron heard Pop's solo stuff and put it on his own label, Invicta HiFi, and then the estimable DJ-type post-post-electronic label Ninja Tune heard that.

Pop took a long time recording his solo stuff because he needed certain sounds. He also needed to octuple-track guitars, pan them insanely, hire mini-orchestras, etc.

His song Sugar Assault Me Now can be heard in trailers for the 2010 film Get Him To The Greek. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pop+Levi">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
