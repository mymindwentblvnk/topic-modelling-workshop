Liars Academy is an Indie Rock group from Baltimore, Maryland. They have released all of their albums so far on Equal Vision Records.  Liars Academy was formed by ex-Cross My Heart guitarist/songwriting Ryan Shelkett and Strike Anywhere guitarist Matt Smith. They recruited drum veteran Evan Tanner to play drums and began playing shows in 2001. Due to Smith's prior commitments to Strike Anywhere, and Liars Academy's busy tour schedule, he was unable to be a full-time member of the band. At this point Chris Camden (Former Cross My Heart bassist) was recruited to play bass on tour, but he worked out so well then when they were home, Matt moved to second guitar. Eventually Strike Anywhere's success continued to grow, and Matt was forced to take an even less active roll in the band, only participating in some of the writing and recording. At this point Fred Fritz was recruited to fill Matt's void on second guitar. The final chapter was when Evan left to pursue his bar tending career, and Eric Fauver replaced him on drums. Liars Academy is now a five-piece powerhouse with the addition of Bryan Elliott (formerly of A Rocket Sent to You) on third guitar.  A slightly modified version of Liars Academy reformed under the name Midnight Revival to play a few shows in 2006. The group consisted of Ryan Shellket, Fred Fritz, and Eric Fauver with a new bass player, as Camden left to join The Firebird Band from Chicago. In late 2006, Camden rejoined the group, and it dropped the Midnight Revival tag and became Liars Academy once again. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Liars+Academy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
