Ten Ven (aka Tom Neville) is the British producer who introduced elements of house and electronic music to Dua Lipa’s music. Still anonymous at the time, he first stepped out of the underground to produce two tracks (and work on several more) on Dua Lipa’s eponymous debut album back in 2017. Major support for Ten Ven’s productions (Honshu Wolf EP, ‘Turn It Up’), has come from Radio 1’s Annie Mac, Pete Tong, and DJ Target, along with industry heavyweights such as Solomun, Sasha, Skream, Gorgon City, Camelphat, Joris Voorn, Monki, Groove Armada, MJ Cole, Mixmag, Clash, Red Bull UK, Dancing Astronaut, and beyond. With influences ranging from Chicago house and French disco, to electro and beyond, Neville first made a name for himself as Ten Ven with releases on labels such as Greco-Roman, Noir, Partyfine, MTA, Weapons, Shadow Child’s Food, and his own imprint, When I Met You. Ten Ven’s last single ‘Otic’, a collaboration with Alex Metric, was released via Anjunadeep and hit No.1 on the Cool Cuts chart; and the pair’s follow-up, ‘Transmission 1 EP’, was a key part of Solomun’s current DJ sets before dropping via Diynamic. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ten+Ven">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
