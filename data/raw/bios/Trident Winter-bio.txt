Blazing out of Perth Western Australia Trident Winter have a quest to bring back the heavy metal stylings of the 80's. Delivering a powerful show with all the agression and edginess that Iron Maiden, Judas Priest and Dio delivered 20 years ago. With a gift for musicianship, melody and catchy choruses, Trident Winter have a show not to be missed.
