The brainchild of Richard and S. Lee , Fateless Tears incorporates elements of progressive, gothic, and symphonic metal into their musical soundscape.  The duo welcomed Paul into the band to share guitar, mixing, & engineering duties in December of 2008.  Working from their studio located in the high plains of eastern New Mexico, the trio fuses their passions for music, life, and the unknown, to create music that beckons listeners to look within themselves to find the deeper meaning in their own lives.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fateless+Tears">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
