 namely a currently active band from Brooklyn, New York, USA, formed in 2008. This act consists of Jemina Pearl, former singer of four-piece garage rock group Be Your Own Pet. Pearl is joined by two friends, one being Dani Golomb and another credited only as "Lauren Oh", as well as Max from “The Trashers”.

According to their Myspace profile, they liken themselves to a “sloppy Weezer” and list their influences as, “animals in sunglasses”, “the woman eating a tub of ice cream on the bus” and, “when you open up a bar tab for karaoke, get trashed, forget to close the bar tab and leave your debit card at the bar, call your friend and tell them to close it for you, and it is only $7 ‘cos the bartender messed up so they just pay it for you ‘cos the credit card minimum is $10.”

In addition to the above, other sources also claim that Rare Form can refer to an act from Portland, Maine, USA. Further details are limited, but they are/were believed to be (or have been) a death metal band.
