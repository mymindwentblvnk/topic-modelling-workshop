Runaway Totem are a bit of an odd Italian group. Their music is in the vein of Zeuhl, founded by French group Magma, but they also show strong influences from more conventional Progressive Rock, namely Red-era King Crimson, and later (as well as earlier) Frank Zappa. They also exercise a strong jazzy side, in addition to a mild Krautrock-like quality in their psychedelic passages. Extremely spacey electronic sections are an integral part of their sound, as well. Despite all these many influences, they are recognized foremost as a Zeuhl group. Strangely enough, they lack the Zeuhl hallmark: a constructed language. Indeed, all of their vocal work is in Italian. 

Their music is strongly recommended to Zeuhl or Magma fans, but also to all Progressive Rock fans not afraid of some intense listening. Three of their albums can be downloaded for free from their official website (http://www.runawaytotem.com in the discography section): Trimegisto, Zed, and Esameron. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Runaway+Totem">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
