The Cansecos are Bill Halliday and Gareth Jones with Paul Prince and Dan McCormick filling out the band on stage. The Cansecos are on the Toronto based Upper Class label, headed by Jones. Though their initial self-titled release draws from many genres, their music is characterised by indie rock lyrics, dance beats, and DIY production techniques wrapped in a standard pop format. Their sound has been compared to Manitoba and label-mates The Russian Futurists. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Cansecos">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
