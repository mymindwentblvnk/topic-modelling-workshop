The heavy-stoner-rock trio DRYAD was founded in Würzburg in 2016. The band's name is based on the legendary forest nymphs (dryads) of Greek mythology – a fusion of mankind and nature.
In the spirit of this close entanglement, guitarist Alex, drummer Sebastian, and singer/bassist Michael combine their musical skills with well thought-out lyrics and create a mystical atmosphere that is shaped by the influences of Kyuss, Elder, Black Sabbath and MC5.
Heavy stoner riffs are tightly interwoven with emotional melodies. Psychedelic sounds are pulling the listener into gloomy worlds and the human-critical lyrics are thought-provoking.
