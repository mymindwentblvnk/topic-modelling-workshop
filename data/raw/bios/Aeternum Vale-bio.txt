Aeternum Vale were formed in the Winter of 2011 in Dublin, Ireland by Dave Gibson, Colin Byrne, Owen Ryan Hanbury and Dave ”Tipper” McCarron.

The band released a 2012 limited edition EP “Farewell Forever” then spent much of 2013 in the studio writing songs for a debut album release. In August, the band entered the studio to record eight songs for what would become 'Inter Arma Enim Silent Leges', the band’s first album, which was recorded live.
