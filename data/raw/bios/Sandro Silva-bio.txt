Sandro Silva is a young Dutch production talent with a percussive, melodic and energetic sound. And judging from the tracks you are about to love, a big future lies ahead for this youngster. At only 16(!) Sandro is already delivering like the “grown-ups”. His Klimak E.P. is a selection of some no nonsense percussive energy. Cool beats, warm percussion and hot vocals, Klimak, Lucky Men & Uno Chico have it all. Not surprisingly, some of the world’s big shots feel the same. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sandro+Silva">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
