About O.H. The initial idea about O.H. band belongs to Bambi (drums) and Kiki (guitars). In the beginning of 2001 join the other two band members - Anton (bass guitars) and Shtipkata (vocals). The music orientation initially is neo metal, but subsequnetly the style gets harder. The guys start strenuous concert activity in the O!Shipka music club and also in the cities of Sevlievo, Plovdiv, Vidin, etc. In 2001 they get their first demo tape recorded in Vidin, it consists of 7 songs and 2 instrumentals. In 2003 in "Graffitti Studio" they record a song for the soundtrack of the paper comics "36" which is called "Haunted". They also record a song with the title "Never again" for the Christmas edition of "Rhythm" magazine. Shtipkata leaves the band and from January 2006 its place is taken by Joro (Good Food, ex-Dreadlockz). The guys start working on new songs and have several concerts around the country. Meanwhile they also score a very successful participation in the graffitti festival "Meeting of styles" 2006. Now they are working on the records of their demo album "Under pressure" which is expected to be ready soon. In the end of september 2006 one more member joins - Naso (Reactija). Many concerts in the cities of Burgas, Varna, Sofia,Blagoevgrad and Sevlievo are following.In the beginning of 2007 the band obtains a new bass guitar player - Dani (Anamnasia). Right now the guys are working on brand new stuff and are planning more concerts around Bulgaria.
