Extreme metal trends are about to ...receive a much needed kick to the throat, courtesy of Sacramento, CA's modern death metal titans, The Kennedy Veil. Avoiding the used, abused and predictable hat tricks that have plagued the extreme metal underground for the last several years, The Kennedy Veil have successfully managed to carve their own path in spite of it. Taking influence from pioneers like Deicide, Morbid Angel and Suffocation coupled with the more refined aggression of bands like Origin, Psycroptic and Decapitated, the end result is exactly what TKV intended. No throwbacks, no breakdowns, no wanking, no trends. Just their own brand of straight forward crushing modern death metal.The band's self released full length, 'The Sentence of Their Conqueror', gave you an idea of what The Kennedy Veil is capable of, and the recently released single, 'Disciples of Dead Aeons', allows an even better glimpse into the band's trend killing sonic evolution. But nothing will fully prepare you for what they are set to unleash with their forthcoming label debut. With Unique Leader as the catalyst, humanity is about to be reduced to ashes! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Kennedy+Veil">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
