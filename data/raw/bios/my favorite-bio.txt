New York City-based My Favorite was Michael Grace Jr, Andrea Vaughn, Gil Abad, Darren Amadio, Todbot, and Kurt Brondo. The group, who formed in 1991, was an artful, depressed collective of pop innovators, hailing from Long Island but longing to be in Paris. Their songs are woefully romantic, cynical, clever, and sweet, capturing the sprit of the new wave: both the 80s music new wave scene and the French film new wave. The band officially called it quits in 2005 after releasing two LPs, several EPs, and 7" singles on Double Agent Records run by Peter Green.
