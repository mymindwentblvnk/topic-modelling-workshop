Formed by drummer Nuno Peixoto and by guitarist José Bonito during the beginning of the XXI century as a honest musicianship effort to blend musical influences from the heavy/rock, thrash and death metal scene from the 80's and the 90's with some progressive and experimental moods from the 70's music. Their recordings include a promotional single entitled " Nothing Divine MMIX " featuring vocalist Nuno Damião and an unreleased 5 track rehearsal session with the addition of bassist Ruben Chamusca and lead guitarist Rodrigo Louraço completing finally the project's formation. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hourswill">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
