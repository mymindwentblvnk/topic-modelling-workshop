Dark Sermon are a melodic death metal/deathcore band from Tampa, Florida that formed in 2009. They were previously known as In Reference To A Sinking Ship, and have been compared to The Black Dahlia Murder, Behemoth, and Job For a Cowboy. They released their EP Aimless in late 2010, and in 2012 they signed with Nuclear Blast Records and eOne Music Nashville for their debut album In Tongues.

Having shared the stage with artists such as Norma Jean, Carnifex, All Shall Perish, Decapitated, The Faceless, and Impending Doom, and having played sets at both the Ft. Lauderdale date of Summer Slaughter and the St. Petersburg date of The Vans Warped Tour, Dark Sermon is quickly earning their stripes in the metal world.

Starting off 2012 with a bang, Dark Sermon has already toured with bands such as King Conquer, Abiotic (Metal Blade), and Forty Winters, and plan to be on the road as much as possible this year.
