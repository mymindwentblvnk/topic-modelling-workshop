Holly Golightly & The Brokeoffs is the Georgia, USA duo of Holly Golightly Smith (aka Holly Golightly) & David Drake (aka Lawyer Dave). They released their album No Help Coming (2011), on Transdreamer, with a USA tour beginning shortly after.

Holly & Dave met in a China Town smuggler's den basement. Golightly was seeking an upright bass player, to do a small USA tour & Lawyer was the only one she found. After a half hour run-through, they were off the next day. You might could say that this was the beginning of their collaboration as the idea of doing records together was first conceived on those long drives in the American West. After nearly ten years, seven-hundred-thousand miles, countless shows and other misadventures, the time finally came.

In January of 2007 they built a make-shift studio, in the Southern English countryside, to record what they had talked about. With only four days to write, record & mix, the pair couldn't have been happier with the result. Supposed to be a low key release, You Can't Buy A Gun When You're Crying (Damaged Goods), attention snowballed enough fill a year's touring. 

The second album by Holly Golightly & The Brokeoffs was recorded in Northern Spain during a break whilst touring their first album. Released in October 2008 & titled Dirt Don't Hurt (Damaged Goods in UK / EU & Transdreamer in North America).
