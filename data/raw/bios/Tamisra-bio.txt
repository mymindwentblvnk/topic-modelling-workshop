Tamisra was formed in late 1996 as a progressive death metal act, being one of GermanyÂ´s earliest bands to combine classical instruments with brutal death / black metal elements. During the years there had been lots of lineup changes, bad luck and finally their retirement from performing live.

Nowadays Tamisra are still alive as a studio project involving founding member Azmo and their latest vocalist Sanvean. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tamisra">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
