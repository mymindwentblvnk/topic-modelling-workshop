To summarize: Lage is a guitarist, a composer and a child prodigy. He has not settled on a musical style. He does Jazz, classical and many others, but since he loves film scores he is willing to dabble in almost anything. Carlos Santana asked him to come on stage back when Lage was 7 years old; he told the rock legend, no thanks. 

The interview presents a humble, smart musician more interested in mastering musical styles than recording and calling attention to himself.
