Black Metal Band from Sweden.
Satanic Slaughter were formed in 1985 by Ztephan Dark.
The first name they used was "Evil Cunt" but after a month  they changed to Satanic Slaughter.

Disbanded in 2005 but due to all the response they got from fans made them reunite in March 2006. However the unfortunate death of the only original and leading bandmember guitarist Ztephan Dark on 19 April 2006 made the bands future uncertain. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Satanic+Slaughter">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
