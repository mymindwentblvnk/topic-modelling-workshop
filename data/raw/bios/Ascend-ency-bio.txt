Spawning from the minds of YvS and SvN, Ascend-ency 's first incarnation was around 1995.
At the time both we're active in bands such as Impedigon, Anesthesy and Iconoclasm.
2 demo's we're recorded but nothing was realy done with them.
In 2005 another demo was recorded.

At that time SvN was the vocalist for Fleshmould.
YvS the guitarist/songwriter in Chalice.

Forward to 2009.
The two got together again to write and record new tunes.
This time with a more serious approach.
In the homestudio's of both songs we're recorded and sended back and forth with the aim to write a full album and release it upon mankind.

Mixed by SvN and YvS, mastered by ReinieR at ShumCot Recording Studio 'Regression' contains  pieces of sonic violence that can be discribed as a mixture of different Metal styles as Death - Black - Thrash and Industrial Metal.
Lyrics theme with the collapse and decay of the human species

Artwork was done by Harbringer Design.

The band is now looking for a label to release this piece of fitlh.

Protagonists: 
YvS:     Musical filth, all razors & keys
SvN:    Psalms, Voices, programming & FX, mixing
