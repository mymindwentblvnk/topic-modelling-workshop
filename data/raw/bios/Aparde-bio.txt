Aparde (born 1987 near Usedom in Wolgast as Paul Camillo Schroeder) is a German electronica and techno-producer as well as musician, Liveact and DJ.
He grew up on the island of Usedom on the Baltic Sea in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and attended the Wolgast Music School for nine years, where he learned to play the drums.[3] As an autodidact, he also worked on the piano and the guitar.[4] First audio recordings were also created with own compositions under influences of, among others, Deftones or Radiohead. The Alter ego Aparde is an ancient Greek word creation using the term Apathy.

In 2011 he released the LP Goldene Barrikaden, which followed in the next few years more collections, such as Maerk, Dim, Loom and others.[5][6][7] He then published on various Record labels such as Stil vor Talent, Traum Schallplatten, Keller Record Label, Lenient Tales Recordings or Ki Records.[8][9]"Apardes Electronica is simply pure quality", says the imprint of Stil vor Talent, which has been run by Oliver Koletzki for years.[10][11] Aparde and his titles can be heard amongst other things on FluxFM, the online magazine XLR8R from California, BBC and others.[12][13][14][15] The Atwood Magazine says to his music: "It is rare to listen to a song nowadays and hear the warmth and grit of unadulterated, every day sounds in it."[16] Common interests connect him among other with Christian LÃ¶ffler and Parra for Cuva. His talent is also expressed in the design of his own cover and Teaser and Video productions. Especially in his albums Glass and Hands Rest as well as in guest productions he uses his warm soulful vocals. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Aparde">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
