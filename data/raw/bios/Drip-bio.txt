Drip can refer to a trip-hop band, an early project of Now It's Overhead's Andy LeMaster and the obscure sludge band with members of Eyehategod.

It's the classic trip hop set-up: two quiet guys in the background to tweak knobs and play instruments, with a hot female vocalist to enthrall the audience with her voice. But Drip goes beyond mere trip hop band cliches: they are meta-glamorous, a little dark, and seductively experimental. “Capable of giving you simulated bliss,” wrote the Manila Times about the quartet. With an EP independently released in August of 2003 and constant live performances, Drip's cult status grew with Manila's musical cognoscenti. Drip's full-length album called “Far Side of the World” is Terno Recording's third release. DRIP is Beng Calma on vocals, Arvin "Caliph8" Nogueras on the Drum Machine/Turntables/FX and Ian "Morse" Magbanua on beats and programming.

Drip the sludge band released a single demo entitled 'Learning about Manners' in 1991. Notable members includ Mike Williams, Jimmy Bower, Brian Patton, and Kyle Thomas. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Drip">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
