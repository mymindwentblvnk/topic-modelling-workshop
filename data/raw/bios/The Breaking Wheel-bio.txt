Our sound has been gradually changing, and so has the band. We've been writing a lot of new material recently that is darker, harder, more interesting, and, we hope, more fun than our old stuff. And we've also been reworking our old material to the same effect. So basically, there is more to say about where we're going than where we've been. Stay tuned for more recordings, more sludge rock, more stoner metal, more party prog.

The band lineup is as follows.
Dan - the Heavy
Jeff - the Loud
Peter - the Fast
Rich - the Pulverizing <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/The+Breaking+Wheel">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
