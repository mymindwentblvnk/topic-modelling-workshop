ZASKA serves up a feel-good blend of funk, jazz, and R&B known as Future Soul. Alongside contemporaries in the genre, Hiatus Kaiyote, Vulfpeck, and Snarky Puppy, ZASKA is popular with anyone who appreciates solid head-nodding grooves with touches of the unconventional. GoldenPlec called his sound, “a colourful, courageous, soul catching, bone shaking, funk.” 

Max Zaska is the maestro guitarist-composer leading a supergroup of Ireland’s finest talent, whose revolving roster has included Hozier and members of Wyvern Lingo, Little Green Cars, and BARQ. 

With blistering guitar licks, soulful vocals, stanky bass hooks, tightly driven percussion, jazzy keyboards, and killer horns, ZASKA’s compositions are a complex mix. Think Steely Dan and Santana meet Erykah Badu and D’Angelo. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Zaska">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
