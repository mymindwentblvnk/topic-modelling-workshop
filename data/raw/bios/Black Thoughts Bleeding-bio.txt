The release of their full length debut „Stomachion“ marks another step in the short but eventful history of Black Thoughts Bleeding. Only a little while after their first show in early 2008 they collect the song material for their EP “Tragedy of Evolution”, and make it available to the world by uploading it to the internet and sending it out to the journalists. The reactions are as euphoric as unexpected; the Rock Hard magazine compares the band to german powerhouses like Heaven Shall Burn and Neaera, while the Stardust magazine presents them as „High Potentials“ in their may-june issue. The first newcomer contests are won quickly and the highlight is a show at the Summer Breeze Open-Air in 2008, alongside bands like As I Lay Dying, Soilwork and Cradle Of Filth. After that, they play club shows sharing the stage with bands like Walls Of Jericho, Settle The Score, The Red Chord as well as Ghost Brigade.

Boosted by this updraft Black Thoughts Bleeding starts recording their debut album „Stomachion“, a fusion of modern metal, thrash and hardcore melting together into a wrathful and simultaneously melodic massif. The interplay between powerful and driving parts and the challenging and tricky passages rebounds almost unabated on surprising catchiness. Their focus is on more than the usual mere accumulation of brutal riffs and breakdowns, it's all about the songs and the joy of playing. Who doesn’t want to disappear in the masses, needs to know to play. With stereotypes, images, and his Myspace profile, listener expectations, and of course with their own instruments.

„Stomachion“ is released in Europe, as well as in the USA, Australia and Asia in 2010 via Silverwolf Productions.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Black+Thoughts+Bleeding">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
