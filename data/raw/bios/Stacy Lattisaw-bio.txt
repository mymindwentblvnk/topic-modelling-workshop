Stacy Lattisaw (born November 25, 1966 in Washington, D. C.) is an American R&B/Soul, Pop, Dance and Gospel music singer. Since the 1990s, she has exclusively sung gospel music, as a callback to her Christian roots.
She recorded her first album at the age of twelve, and has scored 22 R&B chart hits with several songs— "Let Me Be Your Angel", "Jump to the Beat", "Love on a Two-Way Street", and "Miracles"—crossing over to the Pop mainstream. Her first album, produced, arranged, and conducted by Van McCoy, featured the highly-orchestrated disco tune When You're Young And In Love.

In 1980, she went to #1 on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart with "Dynamite!" / "Jump To the Beat." However it was not until she affiliated with Narada Michael Walden, a former drummer with the Mahavishnu Orchestra who was just beginning a career as a producer, that she became a star. Under Walden's direction, she had five hit albums between 1981 and 1986. She also opened for the Jacksons Triumph Tour in 1981. From Lattisaw's 1982 album "Sneakin' Out", Mariah Carey used a sample of the song "Attack Of The Name Game" (R&B #14) for her 1999 number 1 hit "Heartbreaker". Her other big Dance chart hits include "Nail It To the Wall" (#2 in 1986) and "Jump Into My Life" (#3 in 1987). Stacy also scored hits with her childhood friend, the singer, Johnny Gill. 

Lattisaw continued recording into the late 1980s, signing to Motown in 1986. She scored her only #1 R&B hit with frequent duet partner Johnny Gill entitled "Where Do We Go from Here" in 1989. While the success was great, she grew increasingly disenchanted with the record industry. By the early 1990s, she decided to retire from the music industry and concentrate on raising her family. In addition, her official website states that she is now working on a gospel CD. In 2010, Lattisaw's music career was chronicled on the TV One (US TV network) docu-series "Unsung (TV series)", in which she also appeared.
