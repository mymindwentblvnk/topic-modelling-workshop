Tracey Lee is a rap artist from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He emerged on the rap scene in the mid 90's with a regional hit "The Theme" released on the Bystorm / Universal label. This single blasted all over radio immediately and forced Tracey's hand to release his album prematurely. The album while creative was a commercial flop. Tracey Lee for his first album was managed by Bad Boy producer Deric "D-Dot" Angelettie. Tracey Lee was also the first artist to be released on the Bystorm label. His second album Live from the 215 was permanently shelved in 1999.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tracey+Lee">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
