Carnival Creation was founded in the fall of 2004 by members of Troops of Doom and Dustbowl.
Initially their thirst for Thrash/Death Metal was quenched by covers, but they quickly started 
adding their own songs to their repertoire. Their first gig in Eichstätt's Juze encouraged the band to focus on their own material. Since then, Carnival Creation has been playing regularly in clubs and on festivals around Eichstätt and Ingolstadt and earned themselves a devote following as well as a reputation as one of the region's premier Metal Bands.
