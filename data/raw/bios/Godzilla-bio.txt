Godzilla was a death metal band formed in Bayonne, France in 1996 by the Duplantier's brothers, Joe (guitar & vocals) and Mario (drums), Christian Andreu (guitar) and Jean-Michel Labadie (bass). 

They later changed their name to Gojira to avoid copyright issues.

They released 4 demos with their old name: "Victim" (1996), "Possessed" (1997), "Saturate" (1999), and "Wisdom Comes" (2000).
