Crawline was a four-piece melodic metal group from Aarhus, Denmark. They were active between 2000-2005 and released one album in Denmark, Dawn of the Blind. The music was melodic, dark and payed heavy attention to atmospheric detail. 
Crawline disbanded due to musical differences. Leadsinger/guitarist/songwriter Jens Bentzen went on to start the rockgroup Joshua in 2006.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Crawline">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
