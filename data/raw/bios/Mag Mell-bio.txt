Mag Mell is a one-manned recording project from Minneapolis, Minnesota which was created in August 2006, originally under the name Clontarf. The intent was to create a blend of music that took the aesthetic of raw black metal and blended it with the mood and atmosphere that was prevalent in traditional Irish folk music. While the traditional influence in the blend does not strictly adhere to established Irish tradition, it does recall common stories and concepts that encompass whatâ€™s most fitting to the genre. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mag+Mell">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
