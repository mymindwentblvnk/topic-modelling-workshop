HEMDALE was a short lived grind-gore band from Mentor, Ohio. In the time they were a band (1993 - 1997) they had an incredible impact on the underground grind/gore/death scene with a massive sound and ridiculous live performances.

In addition, drummer Craig Rowe was the mastermind behind Visceral Productions and responsible for a slew of underground bands being discovered and subsequently picked up by bigger labels. Among them: Nile, Exhumed, C.S.S.O., and his own Hemdale.
