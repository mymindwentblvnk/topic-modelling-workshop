Velhalla was formed in the fall of 2005 in Silver Spring M.D. The band is made up of brothers Owen and Tommy Sherrod (guitar and vocals, respectivly), Isiah Johnson on drums, and Jordan DePetrillo on bass, both childhood friends of the brothers. Their music takes elements from many genres, including 80's and 90's alternative, classic rock, and reggae, to make a unique sound of their own. The  style of their songs ranges from Radiohead-esq, to early Chilli Peppers funk, and sometimes to a sound similar to Sublime's.
Be With Me, their debute album was recorded in the Sherrods' basement in June'06. Not being satisfied with the sound quality of Be With Me, due to their lack of money and equipment, the boys decided to stir up their change and settled on a producer at Rex Riot Recordings in Wheaton M.D. to help them get the elusive sound they wanted. Their sophmore effort (not yet named) is due late June '07. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Velhalla">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
