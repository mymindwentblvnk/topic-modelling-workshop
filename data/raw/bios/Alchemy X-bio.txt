Critically compared to prog acts like Dream Theater and Fates Warning for much of the mid-to-late 1990’s, Alchemy X nonetheless has managed to carve out their own niche in the very underground scene that is progressive metal in the U.S. At times sounding heavier than the aforementioned bands, AX has also drawn comparisons to Iron Maiden and Savatage, as well as contemporaries in the field like Symphony X, Aztec Jade and Defyance All these characterizations have merit, depending upon which album or song one is hearing at the moment. The superior Petrucci-esque guitar work of twin 7-string ax-men Chris Fox and Rob Schreiber finds the perfect balance between furious riffing and bottom-end heaviness, while Steve Ratchen’s virtuosity on seven string bass(upside down no less!) is a well-documented configuration that further adds to AX's unique sound. Ratchen also adds everything from atmospheric strings to classical piano, laying texture to the bands more lush pieces. Drummer Chris Scorsese walks the fine line between Neil Peart precision and all-out thrashing. New vocalist Tom Engel brings amazing chops and a more modern sound as the band continues to move away from the DT comparisons, evoking the dark imagery and sound of bands like Tool, Tea Party and Korn, as well as the conceptualized lyrics and themes we’ve come to expect from Mr. Ratchen and company. The band is currently recording their third studio album, tentatively due out sometime in 2006.
