Post Metal/Crust/Downtempo influenced by such bands as Cult Of Luna, Celeste, Fall of Efrafa, Amenra, Etc. We are going into the studio to record a 3 song full length lp in mid-May. The Overgrowth LP consists of 3 songs that tell a story of what might happen to the planet, given the continuation of progress and advancement of the human race by any means necessary. The first song is about the self-inflicted demise of human beings, the second song focuses on the immediate aftermath and the beginning positive effects this has on nature, and the third song mainly discusses the complete overgrowth of nature, covering the last traces of humanity.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Monuments+Collapse">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
