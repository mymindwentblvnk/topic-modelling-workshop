One of the biggest and most influential bands of the Japanese indie rock scene, Number Girl are a quartet hailing from Fukuoka, Japan.  Formed in 1995, they gradually gained a following in their hometown, and soon released their first album, School Girl Bye Bye in 1997.  The band was later picked up by Toshiba EMI and released their major label debut, School Girl Distortional Addict.  Initially somewhat evocative of the Pixies and Sonic Youth, the band evolved and found themselves creating their own unique mixture of indie rock and traditional Japanese sounds in their subsequent albums, Sappukei and Num-Heavymetallic (both produced by Dave Fridmann.  

They disbanded in 2002 when it was announced that bassist Nakao was leaving the band, and the former members moved on to other projects - Mukai and Inazawa formed Zazen Boys. Tabuchi formed Toddle shortly after Number Girl's breakup and joined bloodthirsty butchers as an official member after being a guest guitarist for a number of shows throughout their Kouya Ni Okeru tour in early 2003.  Nakao joined Spiral Chord after their original bassist left, and shortly after formed Sloth Love Chunks. 

The band get together in 2019 and have released one new song since. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/NUMBER+GIRL">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
