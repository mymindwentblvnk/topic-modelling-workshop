Tep No is a Canadian producer, DJ, and electronic artist.

Tep No arrived in the mid-2010s with an air of mystery and anonymity, offering up a healthy flow of catchy low-key singles like 2014's "The Last Ones Standing" and 2017's "Eighteen" in a restrained club style that followed in the footsteps of tropical house artists such as Kygo.

Without revealing anything about his background or identity, Tep No began releasing a series of singles in 2014 that were often marked by electric guitar and breathy male vocals in addition to electronics. After featuring singer Jessica Hart on his 2015 track "A Different You," he producing her track "Soul Phazed" and continued to branch out, remixing tracks for other artists while growing his own catalog. Tep No signed with Ultra Records in 2016 and hit the Billboard streaming charts with "The Best Crew," later notching two more streaming breakout tracks in "Swear Like a Sailor" and "Is It Too Much That I'm Asking For."

Sharing the stage with acts like San Holo, Steve Aoki, and the Chainsmokers helped keep his profile high, while subsequent tracks like 2017's "Eighteen" and "Toluca Lake" continued to earn millions of streams. Tep No's producing career continued to pick up in 2018 with remixes of songs by Jesse McCartney and Freya Ridings, while his own tracks "Who We Are" and "Fighting" also put up big numbers. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tep+No">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
