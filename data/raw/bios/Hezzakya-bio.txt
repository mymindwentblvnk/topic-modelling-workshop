Hezzakya is a stoner rock band from Vancouver, BC, Canada that was formed in 2002 and broke up in mid 2008. Members of Hezzakya have since started up a new project entitled Black Smoke Rising.

No time for irony. No time for unclever metal parodies. No time here for lame-ass nu-metal rap/funk bullshit. No time for emo-screamo-homo-lamo. There’s only room for the die-hard and the dedicated and the deliberate and the drop-D and the deadly. They cut to the quick with the time-honoured and passionately reinvented traditions of turbo-distorted power-chords charging their way through minor keys, propelled along by crashing cymbals that are worked too hard to stop shimmering, impossibly huge bass drums sounding the march of the doomed, and startling vocal assault that is nothing short of the archangel’s clarion call to the burning skies above Ragnarok. Clad in hardass black, their sweat-soaked faces blotted out by shaggy manes, dwarfed by the screaming black towers of shuddering amplification, standing sentinel behind them at inhuman volume levels – designed to interrupt heartbeats and shatter brainpans in the finest custom of Black Sabbath and Kyuss. This is Hezzakya. Hezzakya are one of Vancouver’s highest-ranking rock contenders in the metal-power sweepstakes. Named after the phonetic spelling of Hezekiah (the kickass King of Judah), and whose name translate as “The Lord Has Strengthened,” this Hezzakya is no dusty historical footnote to be yawned over. This Hezzakya is the five-headed God of the Riff, whose modern name translates into “The Chord Has Strengthened.” Hezzakya’s reputation has been forged in the molten furnaces of Vancouver’s stoner-rock elite, having shared many stages and incinerated many audiences alongside the likes of Grass City, the Next Hundred Years, and Black Betty.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hezzakya">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
