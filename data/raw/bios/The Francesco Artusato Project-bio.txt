Francesco Artusato is both a solo artist and the lead guitarist of the highly acclaimed Californian deathcore band All Shall Perish. He was born in Italy and is a product of a very musical family. He started playing saxophone at the age of 14 and switched to guitar when he was 19. After graduating Suma Cum Laude from Berklee College of Music in 2006, he relocated to Los Angeles where he has been busy with recording, touring and teaching. His most notable accomplishment to date was being invited back to Boston in 2008 to perform 1st electric guitar for Vuk Kulenovic's "Electric Symphony", a 70 minute massive symphony, sharing the stage with such renowned musicians as Kenwood Dennard on drums (Miles Davis, Sting, Chick Corea) and conducted by Tibor Pusztai.

Chaos and the Primordial is the result of the experiences, studies, thoughts and musical moments that shaped Artusato's sound and vision throughout these years. This album was written, produced and engineered by Artusato and mixed and mastered by Ben Cohen at Sky Blue Studios.

Artusato continues to play in All Shall Perish continuing to work with a variety of composers and songwriters on other projects. In addition to all this, he contributes material to the Guitar Messenger website with his "Technical Difficulties" column.

Make no mistake, Francesco Artusato is a force to be reckoned with and will soon be mentioned with the likes of Jason Becker, Marty Friedman, John Petrucci and Jeff Loomis, amongst other metal guitar heroes. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Francesco+Artusato+Project">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
