Hellbelly was born in early 2004. Since then, they have rehearsed their self-composed
heavy metal songs in otheir rehearsing studio in Lund, Sweden. Their music is heavy and distorted and their
riffs sound a bit like our influences Slayer, Black Label Society, Monster Magnet, DIO and,
of course, Sabbath.

Late 2006 the band's debut album was unleashed. The album, named "What Would Satan Do?"
contains 13 rock-hard heavy metal tracks and is available for order at the website.
