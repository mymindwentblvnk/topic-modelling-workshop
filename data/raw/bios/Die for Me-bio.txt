Die For Me are a gothic rock band from Valencia, Spain.

In the summer of 2003 the new band titled "Die for Me" began when Art (vocals) and Marcos (guitar) met and decided to start a band who are heavily influenced by Gothic Finnish Rock and Metal.
The rest of the members came together in the band within the following months.

After a few changes in the original line up, the band is as follows:

Art - Vocals
Marcos - Guitar
Airus - Drums
Edeny - Bass
Elvea - Keyboards

After the changes the writing of the songs came easily for the band. At the first of the year in 2004 "Die for Me" went on stage and it was the beginning of a series of concerts that the band performed in Valencia and other close areas.

The band recorded a 4 track demo in January of 2006.
