Prosody stems from Pune and has spent its formative years in the thriving energy of pubs & clubs of Koregaon Park, Banjara Hills and Khirkee. The band is now in its sixth year of making music & characterizes itself as a genuine light headed guy with innocence that sometimes loses its stability. There is an element of spontaneity but a warm attitude that gives rise to the subtle yet mischievous flavor in their music.
