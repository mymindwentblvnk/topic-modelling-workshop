Humangled started in 90's as a extreme-grind duo (Goreds/Scurb) under the name of Putrid Sequence (releasing one demotape "Inside Reeking Organs" in 1994). Just after the demo the duo planned to evolve the project into a traditional death metal live oriented combo, including different musicians for 2 years, and finally stabilizing a line up with Paul Lefthand (Bass) and Rob Bellini (Drums), realizing as Humangled the demotape "Anatomic Butchery" (1997).
 After discographical inactivity the EPs "Refoetalize" (2007) and "Edge of Beyond" (2008), got new attention on the band, which opened to the release on 31st May 2010 of the debut album titled "FRACTAL" (sound engineered by Dan Swano at Unisound Studios/Sweden), under Abyss Records (USA).
