Lux Incerta is a French gothic doom metal band founded in 2000. Their name comes from a Latin expression that symbolizes the ultimate moment when light is about to lose its battle against darkness.

After the split of Synoptia, Benjamin Belot (vocals & bass) decided to create his new project: Lux Incerta. The band started to write songs inspired by gothic literature. His influences mainly come from doom and gothic music with bands such as My Dyng Bride, Type O Negative, Paradise Lost, Katatonia or Anathema.
The band always try to lead this project with the best musicians as possible, each of the successive band members having an experience in others bands (Penumbra, The Old Dead Tree, The Last Embrace, and others). A dozen of concerts allowed Lux Incerta to forge a good scenic experience, alongside with more than one hundred concerts with their others bands for the band members.

In February 2003 Lux Incerta recorded the first EP with J.J. Moréac, including "Clear Water".
In July 2007, due to the activity of others projects beside Lux Incerta, the band decides to take a break, just after opening for MY DYING BRIDE at La Locomotive (Paris).
March 2012 saw the Release of "A Decade of Dusk", the first album of Lux Incerta, recorded and mixed by J.J. Moréac. It contains 4 new compositions, including "Shelter" on which appears in guest Manuel Munoz (The Old Dead Tree), plus the 4 tracks of the 1st EP in remixed version.
