Well, the founders of the band were Ima and Ricardo (vocals and guitar) in the beginning of 2005, Porto - Portugal. After an arduous and long research (experiencing with other guys) it was found the respective members Pedro Souto, Pekas and Nuno (guitar, bass and drumms) that were already friends of the band.
