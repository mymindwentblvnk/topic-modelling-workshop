0N0 is an experimental industrial doom/death trio from Bratislava, Slovakia: Sarkast - voice; Acidmilk - guitars, voice; Twisted - guitars, voice, programming.

Originally a one-man project of Twisted, personal additions in 2013 marked a change in direction and transformation into a full-fledged band. The end of 2014 saw the first ever live show, presenting brand new material from the upcoming album planned for the fall of 2015. As a teaser for the album, the band released a single "A Farewell to Conscious Shores" accompanied by lyric video.
The song is also available for free on bandcamp, together with previous releases.
