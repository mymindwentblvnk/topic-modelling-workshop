Somewhere in the 21st century, there was a band named All Frequencies, a cover band. After a while, the band began to fall apart. Drummer, singer and bassist all left the band. But Jonas and Daan still wanted to have the band feeling and started searching for new members and a new style of music to go along with the new band in 2008. It didn't take long to find them a new drummer, since he was right at their school. This way, Nick was recruited into the band. At this moment, the three started considering a new genre and all agreed on Pagan Metal with enough room left to experiment with other genres. Still looking for a singer and a bassplayer, they started recruiting again and soon found a suitable guitarist and singer in Kevin, who, once again, was at the same school. The four of them started rehearsing more frequently and even created some demo songs. Still mising the heavy feel of a bass, the guys looked around for potential bassplayers. After some time they found one in Ruben, another schoolmate who is now a full member of GOA. At this point the band is growing strongly in experience and will become one to keep an eye on in the future
