J. J. Barnes

James Jay Barnes (b 30 November 1943, Detroit, Michigan) is an American R&B singer.

He first recorded in 1960. His early releases including “Just One More Time” and “Please Let Me In”, on such labels as Mickay and Ric-Tic, had relatively little success, but were subsequently picked up as favourites on the English Northern Soul scene. He also covered the Beatles “Day Tripper”, before moving for a short period to Motown Records.

His biggest hit came in 1967 with "Baby Please Come Back Home", which like many of his records he co-wrote. The song reached # 9 on the R&B charts. However, subsequent singles on a variety of labels, including covers of Black Ivory at Today/Perception Records, failed to repeat the success.
