Casey Shea spent a handful of years fronting rock bands in Tallahassee and Nashville before setting out for New York City in January of 2004 to focus on a solo career. A gifted performer with undeniable charm, Casey delivers his songs in a unique way that earns him an audience’s devotion…think Bill Murray meets John Lennon. Melody drives diverse songwriting that is at once quirky and heart wrenching, and the result is a rare treat that is both musically gratifying and raucously entertaining.

The charismatic front man has built a five piece band around his solo material where influences such as The Beatles, Bob Dylan, Beck and Tom Petty shine through in an original sound with an uncommon familiarity right off the bat.

Currently, Casey is keeping busy touring and playing premiere New York City venues as a solo artist and with his band. In June, 2010, he released “Love Is Here To Stay,” the full band follow up to his self recorded solo debut, “Take The Bite.” His third full length album, "In Your Head" was released in November 2011 on Family Records.
