Archaic was formed by 3 ex-members of Braindeath (2001-2004, Hungary) in 2004, setting a new path in musical experience - mainly thrash coloured with many kinds of other influences - but still based on the old style of the group. Among a couple of concerts, the band had its second blitzkrieg in Kiev (Ukraine) the same year, but for the first time under the name Archaic. The members have decided to record the first album and started prepare for the big event. Originally only 4 songs were planned to be on the EP, but according to the band's decision finally 10 songs were recorded to create a full album. In order to produce a professional sound the recording and the mastering were done in one of the most recognized studios of Hungary. Artwork is done by Attila Kiss who created covers for November Doom among others. 
Line up:
Dávid Takács - bass, vocals 
László Püski - guitar, vocals 
Csaba Zoltán Szabó - drums
