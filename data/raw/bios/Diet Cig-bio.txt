Diet Cig is a pop rock band from New Paltz, NY, fronted by Alex Luciano with Noah Bowman of Earl Boykins (Forged Artifacts) on drums.  The two have been playing music together ever since Luciano interrupted the set of Bowman's other band for a lighter. 

2015 saw their recorded debut with the five-track EP 'Over Easy', followed by the double A-side 'Sleep Talk'/'Dinner Date'. 'Swear I'm Good At This', their first LP, was released on April 2017 via Frenchkiss Records and it was produced, engineered and mixed by Christopher Daly in New York.
