LUCID GREY- a Dynamic progressive rock/alternative-metal hybrid w/standout melodies/vocal harmonies. Sounds like a cross between Tool, Mudvayne and Taproot w/elements of Faith No More and Primus. LUCID GREY launched small tours to the regional Midwest (Chicago, Nashville) and the West Coast (Los Angeles, Hollywood, etc.), with showcases gaining attention from independent and major labels, and being described by industry folks as an air-tight & intense stage show. LUCID GREY is now licensed with MTV and Road Rules/Real World! LUCID GREY has embarked on a huge radio campaign throughout the U.S. In partnership with TinderboX music ( www.tinderboxmusic.com  Jon DeLange) 401 of the best college radio stations conducive to their style. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lucid+Grey">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
