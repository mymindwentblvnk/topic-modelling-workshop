Teeth of Lions Rule the Divine are an English drone doom group, formed in 2001 in Nottingham, United Kingdom, that features musicians from other well known metal bands. They take their name from the second song from the Earth album Earth 2.

Black fumes non-verbal carnage spilled forth the unholy mines, minds and lanterns of Nottingham. Souls cracked and burned, a fitting feast for low end wave torment and high sound pressure hexing. Teeth of Lions Rule the Divine is the manifest of doomed mortality, divine suffering and flagellation through trance and drone. Teeth of Lions Rule the Divine commanded forth a golem of leprosy, madness, and punishment.

The original lineup consists of :

Lee Dorrian - vocals (Cathedral, Ex-Napalm Death);
Stephen O'Malley - guitar (Khanate, Sunn O))), Burning Witch, Thorr's Hammer);
Greg Anderson - bass guitar, organ (Goatsnake, Sunn O))), Thorr's Hammer);
Justin Greaves - drums (Iron Monkey, Crippled Black Phoenix, Ex-Electric Wizard).
