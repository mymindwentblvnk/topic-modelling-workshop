Bloodhammer is a band from Raahe, Finland playing in the old satanic thrashy style of black metal. The band was found in 1998 and has releases on Northern Heritage, Breath of Pestilence, and Hammer of Hate.  They have done a split 7" with the Russian band BLACKDEATH, and have done splits also with INCRIMINATED and VOMITFAGO.  They were featured on the seminal PRIMITIVE FINLAND release on Northern Heritage in 2003.

Rumours say that Bloodhammer was formed after Maleficia split up, with almost the same line-up, because the members wanted to play a more primitive and old-school type of Black Metal. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bloodhammer">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
