Knocked Loose is an American metalcore band from Oldham County, Kentucky, formed in 2013 and currently signed to Pure Noise Records. The band is Bryan Garris (lead vocals), Cole Crutchfield (rhythm guitar & backing vocals), Isaac Hale (lead guitar & backing vocals), Kevin Otten (bass), and Kevin Kaine (drums).

The band released their first studio album, Laugh Tracks, on September 16, 2016, and followup, A Different Shade of Blue, on August 23, 2019, both through Pure Noise Records.

For A Tear in the Fabric of Life, Knocked Loose wanted to do something different. Or they may have been forced to. With quarantine upending their extensive touring schedule — “we’ve kind of been consistently on the road since 2014,” says vocalist Bryan Garris — the group found themselves in early 2020 sequestered near Louisville, in Oldham County, Ky., where they’re from. By June, they were hunkered down in a cabin in Pigeon Forge, Tenn., focused on writing a concept album. By the end of September they had finished recording. 

What they came up with is a six song-EP that expands on the narratives hinted at on A Different Shade of Blue, their 2019 full length, and grows beyond them sonically. It’s the band’s most dynamic and contained offering to date, and a balancing act: a mid-length EP with grand ambitions and scope, one full of new sonic elements and a cohesive aesthetic that hangs onto Knocked Loose’s trademark anthemic delivery. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Knocked+Loose">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
