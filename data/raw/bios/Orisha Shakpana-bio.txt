Orisha Shakpana is a one-man black metal project from Portmore, St.Catherine, Jamaica. Orisha are deities of the Ifa spiritual system of the Yoruba people and Shakpana is the Orisha that is a healer and creator of all forms of diseases. The central figure in the project is Andy C. (also known as Ohene Ifrit), who is a 5th generation baba (an Obeah priest) from Jamaica's (and possibly the Caribbean's) oldest obeah cult that remains nameless due to Afrocentric purposes of not mixing with non-africans. 

After failed attempts with the band Dark Cirkus, Ohene Ifrit (then Lord Ifrit) went on to start a solo project (Orisha Shakpana) in 2004. Currently signed to Legion of Death Records, Andy released three full-length albums, a demo, and an EP as shown below.
