Correcto are Danny Saunders on vocals, Patrick from  The Royal We  on bass, Richard Wright on guitar and  Franz Ferdinandâ€™s own Paul Thomson on drums. Inspired by fact, fiction, surrealism and the mundane; and with sounds reminiscent of the Buzzcocks, The Kinks, The Fall, Ramones, 'all the good stuff' as Danny puts it.
