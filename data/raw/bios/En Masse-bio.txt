2. An electronic duo from Milano, Bologna Italy. They are currently a part of the Hypotron Records roster.
Based between Milan and Bologna, En masse are immediately noticed and
Created a stir with the self titled EP, "En Masse EP", gone straight on
Beatport's top 100 in less than a week since released.
Top Ace DJ's like Azzido da Bass and Matt Walsh remain loyal to the Club
Sound but also take the best from the European 'Nu Rave' for a clever mix of
Noise and Techno.
They count various Remixes under their belt for Artists like Ninfa and
Musetta, their trademark seem to be the capacity of creating new sounds that
melt together in a recognisable style that they can now call theirs !
