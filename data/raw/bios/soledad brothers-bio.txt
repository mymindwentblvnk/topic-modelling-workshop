(1998-2006) (2010-present)

Soledad Brothers are an American blues punk group from Maumee, Ohio. Consisting of Benjamin Swank on drums, Johnny Walker on guitar and vocals, and Oliver Henry (who was recruited just before the release of their second album) on sax and guitar, they took their name from a trio of convicted felons, George Jackson, Fleeta Drumgo, and John Clutchette who were incarcerated at Soledad Prison and killed by police fire. They are known for their very energetic, loud sound.

Their debut self-titled album was engineered by Jack White of The White Stripes, with whom they shared an apartment in Detroit.

Singer Johnny Walker now resides in Covington, Kentucky and has started the band Cut in the Hill Gang

Benjamin Swank is now working at Jack White's record label, Third Man Records in Nashville. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Soledad+Brothers">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
