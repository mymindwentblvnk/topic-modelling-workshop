Santogold is the former name of Santigold (born Santi White on September 25, 1976), a singer, songwriter and producer from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States.  She is perhaps best known for her 2008 single L.E.S. Artistes, which became a hit in the UK and on American alternative radio.

Previously, White was the lead singer of the Philadelphia-based punk rock/ska band Stiffed, but, while in the band, she was offered a solo contract.  Working with fellow Stiffed member, John Hill, as co-producer, she recorded her debut album, Santogold, which was released in April 2008.  Her style has been defined as a mix of dub, electronica, hip hop & new wave
In February 2009, she officially changed her stage name to Santigold as a result of infomercial jeweller Santo Gold, who threatened legal action against White and her record label Downtown Records.  However, despite the dispute, the title of her debut album remains Santogold.  Upon the change of her stage name, Downtown Records issued a press release which stated:

“Change the graffiti on the bathroom wall, get your tattoo fixed, get your T-shirt airbrushed and change the name on your year-end list: Santogold is now Santigold. She’s not telling you why, that’s just how it is.”
