Formed in 1998 (with several line-up changes since), the band is comprised of: 
Juho Törmälä (guitar)
Jesse Mäläskä (bass)
Riku Kovalainen(drums)
Jarno Markus (vocals)
Jarkko Markus (keyboards).

The first demo, Siege of Misery, with Ville Kanniala handling the vocals, was released in 2002 and  was followed swiftly by Mirror Image (2003; Antti Ojalehto on vocals) and My Scars (2003) - it was at this point that the Markus brothers joined. This demo was recorded and produced by Pasi Sipilä of Charon. A fourth demo, Ballet Of Death was released in 2004.(Tuomas Valtanen on second guitar). Frostburn made their last demo in 2006 and it was called "Reflections of Heaven". 

Frostburn isn't active band anymore, but some of the members have new projects. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Frostburn">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
