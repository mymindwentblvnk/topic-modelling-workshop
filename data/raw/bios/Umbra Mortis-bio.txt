Hailing from Jakarta, Indonesia, started out as a black metal band, now changing direction to power metal. Releases:

- Alam Arwah Kematian (Demo, 1997) | black metal era
- Darkness Victory (2005) | death/power metal era

The new sound is pure power metal, with clean vocals - unlike their death/power metal era which has 'melodeath' scream vocals.
