This thrash metal / death metal band is from Trois-Rivi√®res, Quebec, Canada.  Satanic started off as Satanic Glue Sniffers by drummer Martin "Marty" Carle and rhythm guitarist & vocalist Mick Fortin.  Marty and Mick had to deal with different lineup changes over the years.  They found vocalist & bassist Izaac Beaudoin (once known as "The Damned") in 2016.  They decided to change their name to Satanic in 2016 since they felt the lineup was established enough to record new material.  They're currently not signed and their lyrical themes include war, Satanism and conspiracy. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Satanic">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
