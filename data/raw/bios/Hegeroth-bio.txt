At the beginning of 2010 Benegar (ex-Mortifier - bass) and Keleborn
(ex-Mortifier - drums, vocals) put together their dark ideas and decide
to bring the Hegeroth project into being. Tailheg (Tail Of Luna - keyboards) joins shortly afterwards and the outline of the first tunes emerge.

A few months activity yields the idea to transform the project into a full-fledged band. Currently the band is working on its promo in melodic black metal convention..

After numerous crew changes permanent members become: Ulfghar - guitar, Fenrir - bass and Edward - vocals.

In April 2012 Hegeroth records the first demo "Spectral Fear" embedded
in melodic black metal style.

In November 2012 Keleborn decides to leave the band due to personal reasons. From this time on Hegeroth has been looking for a drummer
in the meantime using drum machine.

At the same time "Spectral Fear" is being send to the media and record labels.

In July, Broda, the new drummer, joins the band.

In September 2013 Edward and Broda leave the band.

A month later Bila joins the band and Hegeroth starts working on new material. The first album will be called “Thee Emperors' Triangle”. In the meantime Kele (drums) returns to the band.

The band works on recording the album till June 2014.

In June the music video for “The Nameless Enforcerer” is recorded.
