The D.O.C. (born Tracy Lynn Curry  June 10, 1968) is an American rapper from Dallas, Texas who moved to Compton, California, to join the creative force behind the rap group N.W.A Prior to his move, he was a member of the The Fila Fresh Crew.

The D.O.C released his first solo album (produced by Dr. Dre) in 1989 called ' No One Can Do It Better '. This album is widely heralded as a classic. He was involved in a near-fatal car crash later that year. The crash left him with a crushed larynx which severely altered his vocal timbre. He has since released albums 'Helter Skelter' and 'Deuce'. He has continued to be a major influence on rap music by ghostwriting on Dr. Dre's projects, including classic albums such as 'The Chronic' and 'Doggystyle'. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+D.O.C.">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
