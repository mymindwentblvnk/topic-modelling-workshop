Formed in Nottingham, UK in 2010, Twilight's Embrace draw from a range of influences, "blending slow and majestic doom-laden riffs with twin guitar harmonies that switch between the delicate and the destructive, overlaid with deathly roars and gothic baritone choruses".

Debut EP 'Reflections', described as having "confident songsmithing" by PowerPlay magazine and "thoroughly recommended" by Rock Sound, was released in September 2010 and drew favourable comparisons with Opeth, Insomnium, Paradise Lost, and similar artists. This earned them a well-received appearance at the prestigious Bloodstock Open Air festival the following year.

Follow-up EP "Traces" was released in April 2012 to similarly positive reviews and wide play on internet radio, and the band is now preparing to gig in support of both EPs while finalising material for a full length release.
