2. Soviet is also a band from Dallas, Texas that was founded in 2010 by guitarist/vocalist John Spies and drummer Andrew Weir. After trying out several bassists, the duo finally stuck with Richy Brown. Their first EP, "Forever Today," was released online in January of 2011. Available for download at sovietmusic.bandcamp.com

"With nods to Japandroids, the Black Lips and others of that ilk, and a boasting a flair not unlike longtime DC9 favorites Teenage Cool Kids out of Denton, the young group's early output is an impressive one. Forever Today is an impressive collection of pop-indebted, jangly garage rock, filled with all the angst (and apathy) that you'd expect from college dropout Spies and his young collaborators." - Pete Freedman of the Dallas Observer <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Soviet">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
