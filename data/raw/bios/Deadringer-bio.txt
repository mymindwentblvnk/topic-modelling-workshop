Joe Bouchard on vocals/guitar, Neal Smith on drums/vocals and Dennis Dunaway on bass/vocals. Earlier incarnations of the band was called "Brainstorm" (No releases under that name). A latter one "Eyescream" (also no releases).

Finally, after many days of ferocious debate, they finally settled on a new name: "Bouchard, Dunaway, & Smith" aka "BDS" and released some great music (available from Neal Smith's site). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Deadringer">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
