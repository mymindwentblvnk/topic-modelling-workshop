BIONIC ORIGIN is a melodic death metal band from Patras (Greece), formed in 2013 by guitarist Andreas Tasiopoulos and bassist Panagiotis Loukaris.
The band's current line up consist of Vagelis Papadopoulos on vocals, Andreas Tasiopoulos and Antonis Alexandris on the guitars, Panagiotis Loukaris on the bass and Nikitas Mandolas on the drums.

The band’s style contains heavy guitar riffing, which is combined with lots of melodies, thrash-core elements, keyboard/orchestral parts and sometimes breakdowns, in order to give a new interesting identity to its sound. This whole atmosphere is invigorated by the brutal vocals and screams, which from times to times are escorted or replaced by harsh-cleans, especially during the chorus parts. The band’s music features something more than a specific category of metal, with influences that ranges from artists such as Machine Head, In Flames to Lamb of God, Black Dahlia Murder.

In summer 2013, B.O. entered the studio in order to record their first EP. At late 2014, this 4-track promo CD was self-released under the name “BIONIC STATE” getting a really positive feedback from people out there.
The band has already started working on their first FULL-LENGTH album while are planning as many live shows as possible to spread its name and music.
