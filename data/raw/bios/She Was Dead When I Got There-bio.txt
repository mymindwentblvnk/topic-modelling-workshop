She Was Dead When I Got There was formed in late 2009 by guitarist Dalton Robertson and drummer Chris Petersen. In 2010 they recruited bassist Tyrel Sanders and vocalist Tony Martinez of Viraemia (Phoenix, AZ). After recording a couple songs Tony left the band to continue working with Viraemia. A few short weeks later the band had acquired two new vocalists, Lloyd Moore Jr. of Monumental Torment and Brandon Shobe of Necrambulant (Phoenix, AZ). Due to the long distance between the two vocalists and the rest of the band, after playing a couple shows this lineup had to be dismantled. Early 2011 saw the arrival of Cody Brown, former vocalist of From the Depths of a Nightmare (Kingman, AZ), and Justin "Wang Wong" Brown, former guitarist of Gheara (Kingman, AZ). With the lineup finally solid, the band put out a two song demo (2011), played shows throughout the southwest, and are continuing to hone their skills to bring forth their diverse and technical brand of death metal. The first full length coming out in 2012, fans can expect complete auditory decimation. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/She+Was+Dead+When+I+Got+There">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
