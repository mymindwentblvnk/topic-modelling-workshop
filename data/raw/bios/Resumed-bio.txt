The band was founded in Sulmona, Italy in 2007 by bassist Carlo Alfonso Pelino, supported by drummer Filippo Tirabassi and guitarists Daniele Presutti and Nikolas De Stephanis, with the name Holy Terror. The band later changed its name in "Resumed".

After 2 years of live activity, on December 29, 2009, the self-produced demo cd "Human Troubles" was released.

Nikolas left the band in January 2012. In the following year, the band self-produced its debut album "Alienations" and played live shows with a reduced lineup.

In 2013 the band's lineup finally returned to be complete, but underwent a variation: Carlo became the second guitarist and Giulia Pallozzi joined as bassist. 

Debut album "ALIENATIONS"  was released on Bakerteam Rec. in 2014.
