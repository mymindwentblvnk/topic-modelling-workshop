Ion Ivanovici (alternatively, Iosif Ivanovici, Josef Ivanovici) (1845-1902) was a Romanian composer. He wrote over 350 dance pieces and marches, but today his only work known to the public is The Waves of the Danube (Romanian: Valurile Dunării) --- listen here, a waltz, which was performed at the 1889 Paris Exposision and took the audience by storm.

A World War II film titled Valurile Dunării directed by Liviu Ciulei was produced in Romania in 1959, and the waltz by Ion Ivanovici was used in the film.
