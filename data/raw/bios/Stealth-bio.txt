There are two bands with the name Stealth and one selfpromoted dj.

The first is one of the aliases of happy hardcore producer Nick Arnold, whose recordings as Bang! are more familiar to listeners.  Stealth have appeared on Sy's Bonkers 6 Mix as well as Happy2BHardcore 4.

The second is a 5 piece metalcore band from Whittier, California. Stealth started off as a 3 piece band with no vocals that consisted of Nik Ontiveros, Jimmy Saavedra, and Josh Parker. After a search for a vocalist initially failed, they decided to bring in Josh's brother, Jon Parker. After that, guitarist Roland Leonard was added to complete the 5 piece set. Stealth has since played countless backyard and club shows, even the now legenderay "Whittier Skate Land Shows." 

Stealth combines metal riffs with John's emotional lyrics and Jim's intense fast-paced drums. They have 2 demos, the first demo is considered a classic amongst several of stealth's earliest fans. The most notable song on the demo is the cult classic "S.U.A.S.S." which is an acronym that only the stealth members know the meaning behind.

Dj Stealth is only a beginner but he is strong with the force and cathing up fast.


Stealth is currently re-inventing their musical style. Some members are even out touring with other bands but Stealth will release new material soon. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Stealth">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
