Blast Radius is:
Lachlan Hessing - synths, effects, percussion
Ryan Brewster - guitars, effects

Originally starting out as a solo project, Blast Radius was Lachlan's musical outlet for the best part of six years. 

Adopting the Blast Radius name in 2007, the project's distinctive sound has slowly evolved to the point it is at now. 

Ryan came on board later as guitarist, adding a new dimension to the mix. The pair continue to expand. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Blast+Radius">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
