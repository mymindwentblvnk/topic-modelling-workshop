Waterclime is yet another project of Andreas Hedlund aka Vintersorg of the band of the eponymous name, as well as Borknagar, Otyg, Cronian, Fission, and Havayoth. Unlike Vintersorg's other bands, Waterclime is in no way metal, but rather a unique blend of progressive rock and jazz with melody and atmosphere as its focus. The sound is difficult to compare to other bands, but it is vaguely reminiscent of Yes, Black Bonzo, Uriah Heep and Rush.
