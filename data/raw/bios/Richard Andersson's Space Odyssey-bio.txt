Space Odyssey is a neo-classical progressive metal project formed by keyboarder Richard Andersson and guitar player Magnus Nilsson. After the two having a dinner they decided to do something together and the guiding principles were set. Richard and Magnus have known each other for years but never got together in studio. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Richard+Andersson%27s+Space+Odyssey">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
