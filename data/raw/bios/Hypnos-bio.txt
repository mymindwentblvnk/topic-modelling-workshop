1. Death metal band HYPNOS was founded back in 1999 by BRUNO (bass / guitar / vocals) and PEGAS (drums), both being previously involved in the band KRABATHOR. Instantaneously Hypnos became one of the leading Czech/Slovakian death metal acts.

Having signed with Morbid Records (de) in 2000, the self-titled MCD got released followed by the debut full length ‘In Blood We Trust’ the same year, featuring Mika Luttinen / Impaled Nazarene as guest vocalist. The release was promoted during the NO MERCY FESTIVAL where Hypnos shared the stage alongside MORBID ANGEL, DYING FETUS, BEHEMOTH, ENSLAVED, and THE CROWN.

In 2001, the second album “The Revenge Ride” was released. This album was recorded and mixed by HARRIS JOHNS (HELLOWEEN, KREATOR, SODOM, TANKARD, PESTILENCE, VOIVOD) and mastered at MORRISOUND Studios (Tampa, FL). Following its launching, HYPNOS participated in events including WITH FULL FORCE, SUMMER BREEZE, PARTY-SAN and HELL ON EARTH among others.

The third album ‘Rabble Manifesto’ (2005) recorded again with Harris JOHNS received an extremely positive response within the global metal music media. Additionally the album got nominated for the Czech Andel Award (a Grammy Award equivalent) under the Hard and Heavy category. In January 2006 HYPNOS performed live with CENTINEX and PURGATORY before going on a deliberate hiatus.

Bruno and Pegas reformed Hypnos after four years of silence and the EP ‘Halfway To Hell’ was released. A comeback show was performed at the BRUTAL ASSAULT Fest in 2010 and the band gained a massive response from around 13,000 fans. ROOT’s bassist IGORR joined as a guest guitarist before becoming a permanent member. Meanwhile, VLASA (Six Degrees of Separation) joined the band as a second guitarist and consequently three shows were performed together with NAPALM DEATH. 

By late 2011, Hypnos got signed with the German label EINHEIT PRODUKTIONEN, and the fourth album entitled ‘Heretic Commando / Rise Of The New Antikrist’ saw the light in April 2012 including a bonus DVD for the digi-pack edition. Recording duties were handled by the Norwegian sound engineer Børge FINSTAD (MAYHEM, IHSAHN, BORKNAGAR, ULVER). This was a breakthrough in the band’s history and quality reviews resulted in press like DECIBEL MAGAZINE (8/10), ROCKHARD, LEGACY, METALLIAN, TERRORIZER, EMP, and NUCLEAR BLAST. Furthermore Cili Chili, the Czech VODAFONE magazine featured an exclusive interview with Bruno concerning the band and the metal music scene. Hypnos shot a video for the track title ‘Inverted’,directed by Mejla BASEL, responsible for MACHINE HEAD ‘Darkness Within’ and the Czech Academy Award winner MARKETA IRGLOVA ‘Crossroads’ videos. During 2012, Hypnos performed live with NAPALM DEATH, and later with VADER during the BACK IN BLACK tour.

In 2013 year HYPNOS have been scheduled for example for EXTREME FESTIVAL (GER) or BRUTAL ASSAULT FESTIVAL (CZ).
