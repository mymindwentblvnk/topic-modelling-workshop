The music of Pulsar Colony is inspired by several things - the universe, outer space, philosophy, forces of nature (both peaceful and hostile), landscapes, hiking through forests, mythology, history, literature, science fiction, fantasy, mysticism, alternate realities, misanthropy, war, struggle, the fate of mankind and the world, insanity and other workings of the human mind... basically anything the muses plant inside my mind as a source of inspiration.  Pulsar Colony is all about expressing atmosphere and imagery related to various concepts that interest me, and does not support any political, religious, or ideological agendas.
