Hailing from the alpine slopes of the Tyrol mountains (via the glistening shores of San Frantastic) this band deliver what the world has been waiting for in terms of action adventure rock and roll. Boasting bursting muscles, mind-warping tales of futuristic battles and ballsy attitudes about chasing the pump and eating green berets for breakfast: "ArnoCorps ARE the greatest band of all time," said one fan on ArnoCorps' biography page.

Their debut album was recorded live in the studio, and succeeds on many levels at retelling the tales of ancient Austrian folklore as they believe the forefathers and, indeed, even history itself, intended them to be exactly recorded.
