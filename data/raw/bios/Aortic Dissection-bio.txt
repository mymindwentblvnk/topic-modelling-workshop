After finding new members and playing various shows up and down the UK, Aortic Dissection had just about found their sound in 2007. Blending the technicalities of bands such as The Faceless and Necrophagist with the skillfull songwriting of bands like Sikth and Between the Buried and Me. After completing a short tour over the new year and currently writing their debut EP, Aortic Dissection are set to take on the underground metal scene by punishing audiences with their brutal live show in 2008. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Aortic+Dissection">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
