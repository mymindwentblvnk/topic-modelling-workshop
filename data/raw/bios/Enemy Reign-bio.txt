Originating from Denver, Colorado, ENEMY REIGN is a band that does not adhere to the restrictions of a closed minded genre. Not afraid to draw influence from Early 90’s Death Metal, late 80's Grindcore, East Coast Hardcore, and Bay Area Thrash, friends and fans have coined the term "metal for metalheads"
 

Enemy Reign is currently marketing their self-financed debut EP, Means to a Dead End, recorded by Dave Otero at Flatline Audio (CEPHALIC CARNAGE, MARTRIDEN, COBALT). Under the leadership of former SKINLESS vocalist Sherwood Webber, ENEMY REIGN successfully self-distributed the debut EP digipak through their own online web store (http://www.enemyreign.com), and many other digital distribution and traditional retail outlets.
 

In addition to Webber, ENEMY REIGN also features Andon Guenther, creative director, programmer, and co-creator of Sick Drummer Magazine. ENEMY REIGN has generated significant buzz gaining the support of international press and radio. While the band would emphatically agree that the Means To A Dead End is a great representation of what they are all about, it’s unanimous among the members that ENEMY REIGN must be seen live to fully experience the group in its domain. From the acrobatic feats of Webber, to undeniable stage presence and crowd participation, anything can (and usually does) happen.
 

In today’s turbulent times of music distribution, ENEMY REIGN are currently acting as their own record label but are using Means To A Dead End as a provocation to those interested in joining the fight. Looking forward, ENEMY REIGN plans to continue its homegrown marketing onslaught promoting the EP. The band will record their yet to be titled full length in 2009. With touring and major distribution on the horizon, it’s time to BRING THE REIGN. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Enemy+Reign">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
