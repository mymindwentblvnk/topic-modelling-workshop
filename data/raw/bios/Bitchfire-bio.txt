BitchFire is a hard rock band from USA  that combines screaming guitars and powerful female vocals with blood-pumping revenge lyrics. The band burst onto the South Florida music scene in November of 2006 with a classic hard rock sound and outrageous live shows that blasted audiences with total, unapologetic fun. 

BitchFire's members are all veterans of 80s hard rock.  The band is fronted by Boston rock goddess Sharyn Peach, with insanely cool guitar licks by Donny Sutton-Brown. Filling out the quartet is bassist Robbie Plast and drummer Eddie D. (formerly of Sea of Black).  They released their debut, self-titled album in May 2009.
