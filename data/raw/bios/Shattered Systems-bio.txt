Formed in Fall of 2009 in Tucson AZ, Shattered Systems is a band that intends to make a permanent imprint of their sound in the Progressive Metal genre with incredible skills and musicality. Starting off covering 80's Metal and Progressive Metal songs, Founding members Avelino Ramirez (Keyboards) and Nathaniel Dominguez (Guitars) were in need of some serious musicians capable of performing the demanding technical and co-writting skills they needed.

Performing many shows at various great venues including The Rialto Theater, Mesa Arts Center and The Rock, they began forming their sound over years of experimentation with the genres. Along the way, discovering bands such as Dream Theater, Animals As Leaders, Haken, Lost In Thought, Dream Evil and Helloween, the inspiration began to unfold and the band switched from covers to only performing their own songs.

They spent a lot of time writing their music and looking for locations with a demand for Progressive Metal. 
As the evidence of the location weaknesses for their genre increased, they began to realize they needed to be proactive. Understanding all three of their musical intentions they relocated to Los Angeles, California for Musicians Institute for the knowledge to write better and better music and to find their last two missing pieces of the puzzle which include a bassist and vocalist .
