The Circle Of Zaphyan was created at the start of 2002 by Athanassios Aggelis, (who is the basic composer) and Kostas Savvidis(ex-Nightfall). Later on Apollon Zigomalas  ( Cerebrum)  joined the band as the vocalist. The style of the music can be described as sinister/space death metal. The basic concept of the lyrics concern mostly space, strange phenomena of the universe, science and technology, all that filtered through a 'veil' of inner searching , with a mood of melancholy and dark atmosphere...with one word, chaotic. The first interference came on april-may 2002, with the 'sublimation' demo. The demo contained 3 tracks and was recorded in our personal studios, the 'Zero Gravity Studios'. production was also made by Athanassios. The logo and artwork of the cd was created by Draenzarth (End). In the 2nd quarter of 2004, a new promo came out entitled 'Flesh Without Soul'. The band is going to release a mcd soon, entitled 'Biochemical Psychosynthesis Eternal'. This mcd will contain 8 songs, recorded within 2003-04. These songs were meant to be part of a full length album that was never released ( back then ), due to technical problems during the recording sessions. The mcd will be released by BMinor Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Circle+of+Zaphyan">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
