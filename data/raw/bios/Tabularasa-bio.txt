There is more than one artist with this name:


1) Tabularasa is a 4 piece from Swansea, pumping out riff heavy good time grooves. "Pigeonholed" in such eclectic forms as "Psychadelia", "Doom" and "Alt-Rock", their debut "Born In The Barn" should have something for everyone. 

Formerly known as "The Marshland Massacre", they are set to release "Born In The Barn" in the near future, with a follow-up record already being planned.
