Amber Arcades is the solo-project of Oh, Brave Wide Eyes' front-woman Annelotte de Graaf. Having started her musical career in 2010 in a Philadelphia-based bluegrass band, but also having a deep love for weird electronics and louder music as a remnant of her teenage years, she combines folky melodies and harmonies with spaced out guitars and poppy structures. The result you could call dreamfolk, or singer-shoegazer. The first album Fading Lines was released on 3 June 2016 and was generally received with critical acclaim in The Netherlands. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Amber+Arcades">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
