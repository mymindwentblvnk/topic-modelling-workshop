A noise pop quartet from Kent, England. Formed in January 2006 by guitarist and singer Matthew Simms and bass player Paul Michael, soon joined by electric organ player Jack Theedom and more recently by drummer Will Blackaby, after a succession of other drummers (Dimitri Sudell, Lorraine Baker, Billy Cunningham).

And in 2012 they have released their sophomore album. "Laughing Party" is now available on all record stores under 4AD records.

All recordings so far are made by the band, written recorded and mixed in Matt's garage.
