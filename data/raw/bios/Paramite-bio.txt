Paramite is a thrashmetalband formed in September 2008. Members of the band are Etienne (lead/rhythm guitars and vocals) Rick (lead and rhythm guitars) Reinier (bass) Jasper (drums). Just four guys into oldschool 80's thrashmetal. They realized that there were no thrashbands in this scene and had enough of all those new-metalbands and emo garbage which dominate this musicscene! No oldschool thrash like it's ment to be, so they created this band to make the music they love and let everybody see that oldschool Thrash is still alive and aggressive of course!! Paramite as a band tries to bring the oldschool 80's Thrashmetal back in the scene, let the people bang their heads and create that oldschool atmosphere like it was in the undergroundscene back in the day! Paramite got it's influence by the oldschool metalbands from the German Thrash scene, the American Thrashscene and of course all other good Thrashbands in this world! See you guys at one of our shows!! THRASH OR BE THRASHED !!
