Adolf Castle was a heavy/power metal band formed by guitarist Cyril Thor in 1992 in Moscow, Russia. They were very popular on Moscow underground stage in 1992-95, also as a Manowar cover band. In 1994-95, they recorded and released on tape their only album available, "Really Crazy Germans". Shortly afterwards, the lead vocalist Dee (Dylan) Troy left the band. There is no information on any activity of the band afterwards.

Lineup:
Cyril Thor - guitars
Dee Troy - vocals
Wolf Maria Hunter - guitars
Attila - bass
St.Patrick - drums

The band name is ambiguous and has served the band bad service several times. However, according to Cyril Thor, it refers to some German folklore hero, a reckless beer-drinker. The lyrics for most songs can be described as "beer metal". 

The album was re-released by Russian label "Valiant Music" in 2000 on CD.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Adolf+Castle">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
