BlindNine was formed at the end of 2002 in Turku, which is a city in westcoast of Finland. In the very beginning BlindNine sucked influences from the nu-metal bands of that time ( Korn, linkin park, disturbed, staind...) and some of their songs had even rap vocals. First demo was recorded in 2003, but the first time "in real studio" was in 2004 when BlindNine recorded their "Control" named demo which held inside 2 rock/metal mixed songs, Control and a bit faster and more agressive Hide 'n Seek.
2004 and 2005 were ruined by the great army of Finland (ignore the barely noticible smell of irony on the description...) that kept the guitarrists Iiro Kelloniemi and former bassist, these days guitarrist Mitja Välimäki from creating new BlindNine material. At the time of an army visit of the drummer Janne Roivas, BlindNine turned into its present form of quintet as Lauri Tuominen stepped in to play bass.
Now in the beginning of 2008 BlindNine is about to step into the studio to record their debut EP which will be constructed from four or five metal songs and carry the name "A lie behind the silence". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/BlindNine">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
