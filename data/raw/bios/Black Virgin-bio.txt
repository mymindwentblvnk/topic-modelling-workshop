Black Virgin is a long-running heavy/speed metal band from New York City, formed by vocalist/guitarist Kenny Lienhardt & drummer Cathy Burke circa 1980. Original bassist/vocalist Jimmy Strain left soon after their '.44 Killer' single was released, forming his own band named Sapient. Black Virgin had three other bassists afterwards, settling on Joe Cerna in 1984. Their sole studio album, 'Most Likely to Exceed', was issued in 1986 by the notorious German label Metal Enterprises & is one of the best-regarded releases on that imprint. Lienhardt is now a soundman at Manhattan's Bowery Ballroom. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Black+Virgin">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
