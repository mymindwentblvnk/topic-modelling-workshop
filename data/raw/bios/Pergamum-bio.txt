Pergamum are a metalcore band from the Central Coast. They formed in '06 and have just released a full length album entitled "Feel Life's Fear". 
They have played support for bands such as I Killed The Prom Queen, Bring Me The Horizon (UK), The Red Shore, The Ghost Inside (US) & Deez Nuts.

The band has taken influence from a wide range of styles like modern day metalcore, thrash, traditional sounds and Progressive queue's. This mixed with their own breed of tunes, plus the intense stageshow which involves front man Jake Dobson ordering the crowd into a frenzy is what the band is about and this doesnt matter if they are playing to 100 kids or 1000, they always bring the same intensity to the forefront. Pergamum is your straight up genuine band. This shines through with their strong beliefs in God. The band are proud to be Christians and hope people can take something positive away from their uplifiting lyrics. 

The band comprises of:

Jake Dobson: Vox
Michael Alexander: Lead Guitar
Aaron May: Guitar
Luke Schoonbeek: Bass
Jason Alexander: Drums
