After five years in the shadows, a dark horse of the New Zealand metal scene emerges in Melbourne, Australia under the guise of "Absinthius". His debut solo-album "IX" is a ferocious aural assault and a vividly illustrated journey into the lowest circle of Hell, themed entirely on "Inferno" from "The Divine Comedy" by Dante Alighieri. This masterfully crafted composition is a swirling maelstrom of mind-melting intricacy, showcasing skin-blistering speed and technicality. Riffs of lumbering sludge and spine-severing slam are cut by a bleak ambiance and passages of droning symphonic interludes. Guest artist Josh Sagar delivers a phenomenally blood-curdling vocal performance throughout the album, wickedly incarnating the demonic voices of the underworld. 

"IX" delivers a nostalgic overview of the evolution of modern metal over the last nine years, containing the bones of songs written for a catalogue of projects and collaborations, fused seamlessly with a deluge of all new material. Vocal lines were recorded by Lewis Noke-Edwards over numerous sessions at SAE in South Melbourne. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Absinthius">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
