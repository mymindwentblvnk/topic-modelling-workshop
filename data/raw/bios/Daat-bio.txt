Brooding synthesizers and meticulously sourced samples combine seamlessly in the sonic territory created by DAAT. The duo explores the minimal, post-autonomic Drum & Bass aesthetic in the 85/170 BPM range, resulting in music that is as emotionally charged as it is rhythmically dense. Core themes in their productions are the interaction with virtual technologies and cyberspace, and the ramifications of alternate dimensions. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Daat">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
