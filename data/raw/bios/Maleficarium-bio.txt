Maleficarium is a Melodic Black Metal band from Santiago, Chile, formed in 2004. Their members include Lord Daemoth on guitars and vocals (and programmed drums), Abadion on keyboards, and Infernalis Morte on bass. Maleficarium's music is a mix between the style of bands such as Emperor, Dissection, Dimmu Borgir, Dawn, and other classic bands of Melodic Black Metal. In 2005 they released a demo called "From The Endless Obscurity Thy Legions Rise", which has 3 songs and an intro. In the same year, the single "War Against Christianity" appeared in the South American Black Metal compilation CD by a Estonian label called 2Dragons. The band split up after that. In 2009 Daemoth and Infernalis Morte gathered again to form a new project called Cathar Eclipse, this time playing blackened death metal. They worked throughout that year in a debut album that will be released in the first part of 2010. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Maleficarium">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
