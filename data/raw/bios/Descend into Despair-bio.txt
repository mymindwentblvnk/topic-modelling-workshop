The first steps of Descend into Despair into this barren world  were made in a gloomy day of February, 2010 in the cheerless town of Radauti, Romania. The band took birth from the ashes of many projects Denis Ungurean and Alex Cozaciuc tried to form.

Musically speaking , we focus on the funeral doom metal genre. Our lyrical themes oscilate between the hope of a better tommorow and the decaying society that surrounds us. The downspiral of mankind is probably our most proeminent source of inspiration while misanthropy, dissapointment and many other negative emotions fuel our music. 

On the 31'th of December 2010 we released our first material entitled "Wings of Solitude", a 5 track demo produced and released independently. Five months later, on the 21st of May 2011, our second material, "Vanity Devotion" was released. The 5 track EP streched deeply into our souls and surfaced our most traumatic emotions. Positive response was received in the underground community. Following the tragic death of Jonas Bergqvist from Lifelover (a band that is very dear to us) we have released the single Hierophant of the Night at the 13th of may 2012 in his memory. Later on that year we changed our location to Cluj-Napoca offering us many more possibilities. 

Early in 2013 we have recruited two new members: Bogdan Florea at rhythm
guitars and Florentin Popa at keyboards.
