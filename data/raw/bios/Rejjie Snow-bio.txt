Alexander has been rhyming since he was just a kid in Dublin. After moving to Georgia at 17 on a football scholarship, he decided to pursue music instead and dropped his experimental first mixtape, 'Rejovich.' The EP introduced the world to his surreal style and villainous eloquence, amassing over 6.4 million plays.
