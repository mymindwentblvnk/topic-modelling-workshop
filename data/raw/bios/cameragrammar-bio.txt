Hailing from Los Angeles, California, USA, Hans Shen, AKA cameragrammar, weaves together synth-fueled melodies, cleverly chopped vocals, and powerful subs to create his self-proclaimed style: “bass music for softies”.

Drawing from influences in the chillout, hip hop, and electronic genres, cameragrammar has used the past year to build momentum with frequent track releases and energetic live performances.

While optimistic about the project’s future growth, he maintains that his musical and creative goals are simple: To make you feel. And hopefully dance too. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/cameragrammar">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
