1. Evasion was a hardcore band from Trondheim, Norway formed in the late parts of 2005. The band consisted of Andreas (vocals), Knut & Fredrik (guitars), Morten (bass) and Martin (drums). The band initially started out during fall 2005 with the intention of having fun making some classic 80’s hardcore in the vein of Youth of Today, Bold, Jerry’s Kids, Bad Brains etc. The band’s longest ever show was played at Black Eyed Bean in Oslo, when they played for at least 15 minutes (which included a Dag Nasty-cover and a replay of a song). 

A few years later Morten discovered a long lost videotape recording, and released a demo, which is available for free download, on his own label Mars Melons.  Hockey Temper consist of three songs recorded with a video camera (hence the rather squeeky quality) in Martin’s basement one evening during fall 2005.
