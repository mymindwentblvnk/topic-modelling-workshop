Debris Inc. is the new Band from Dave Chandler (Saint Vitus) and Ron Holzner (Ex-Trouble, Novembers Doom). Jimmy Bower (Superjoint Ritual, EyeHateGod, Down, Crowbar, ...) is doing the drums.
The songs are a mixture of Hardcore/Punk (the roots of Dave Chandler) and Doom Metal. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Debris+Inc.">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
