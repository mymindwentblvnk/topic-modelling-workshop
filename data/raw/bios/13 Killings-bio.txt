Since October 2004, 13Killings has progressed immensely, starting off a band with friends from high school. Until this day, the line up has gone through a variety of changes whether it was with the band members or style of music. "Serenity's Ebony Dream" was released back in March 2006. During that time, the band experienced and tried new things for themselves as musicians. The line up to date now consists of 5 members which include, new guitarist, Mason and new vocalist, Adam. The band was in the studio this past summer writing, recording, and getting ready to release a new album with a new sound. "The Spectacle" is out now. Thank you especially to all of our fans, friends & family for all the support throughout the years. This is only the beginning...
