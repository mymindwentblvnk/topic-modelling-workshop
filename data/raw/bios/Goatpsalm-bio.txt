GOATPSALM, the jackyl-hyde quintessence, where malign currents of Dark Ambient undermine and swap desolate landscapes of Death Industrial, became aware of its potent powers in February 2009 by infesting the minds of Morkh (ex. Izakaron, Invoked), Horth (ex. Karna) and Sadist (Misanthropic Art, Baal Zebuth, Christ Invertion, Cyber Baphomet, Deathmoor). 

As year-worm crawled to the end of its droning cycle, in February 2010 the first rite "Sonic Desterilization of Light" was performed to wreak swarms of pestilential locust upon this world. Such revered (and fevered!) Demons as V.T. (MOR), d. (SECT), Surzheon and Raattent (ex. Morbid Lust, Izakaron - session) took their evil part in the GOATPSALM mess. 

Reality starts flickering in and out as the sonic vibe in the black vein of Archon Satani and Abruptum weighs heavy on the room… Soon reality is no more. Throbbing waves of sound pull out the listener’s very soul. Before you know it, you’re trapped in the Nether-Corridors that have no end. Neither do you - the eternal suffering is all yours now. Along with those stolen children you once had heard of but chose to forget. 
Downward you step... 
Deeper…
