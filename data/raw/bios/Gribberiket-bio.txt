This is doom metal. As desperate as it is drunken. There is none of the gear/amplifier fetishism associated with modern doom here. Just doom, pure but unexpected in its form. This is grim as death by starvation and as merciless as the beaks picking on your flesh in your last moments. Ughhh!!

Gribberiket consists of SFS (vocals/guitar), Kybermensch (guitar/noises), Witchfucker Wangen (bass) and Gimp Molestor (drums/vocals).
