FREE KEY BIT CHESS have been forging their very own brand of Metal since 1995. Just as the term Rock ’n’ Roll has many facets, this Munich band draws from the different layers of the Metal genre, without fighting its established categorizations. The tuned ear may recognize influences from bands like Machine Head, Godsmack or Prong – but in the final assessment, what the boys do is simply make good hook-and-riff Metal that really kicks ass. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Free+Key+Bit+Chess">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
