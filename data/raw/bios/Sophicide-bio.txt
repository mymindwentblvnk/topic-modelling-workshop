Founded in 2009 Sophicide started as a one-man-project by 19-year-old musician Adam Laszlo, dedicated to creating brutal and technical, yet melodic and elaborate death metal. 
After the first few months enough material was written and produced to release the first EP "The Art Of Atrocity", which gained great responses throughout.

Soon Sophicide would become a respected name in the local german death metal community. Shortly after the first release Sophicide signed a deal with Willowtip Records.

Since then Sophicide worked relentlessly on writing new material for the first LP. Almost two years later the deed was done - the debut record entitled "Perdition Of The Sublime" was written, recorded and produced by Sophicides yet only member. This release was widely praised by fans and critics alike. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sophicide">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
