A black metal band from Bergen, Norway that formed in 2005. The band was put on hold in 2012. Jotunspor is not a live band and can only be experienced on record. When asked to do a noisy Black metal record for Cold Spring Records, King (ex-Gorgoroth, Sahg, etc.) and Kvitrafn (Sigfader, ex-Gorgoroth,) teamed up and formed 'Jotunspor' (tracks/traces of giants). Musically their debut album Gleipnirs Smeder binds grim and primitive black metal together with elements of noisy dark-ambient, while the concept of Jotunspor is strongly fundamented in the old Norse cults and beliefs. Glepnirs Smeder, or the The Forgers of Gleipnir, explores some of the incidents surrounding the creation of the world and Ragnarok - the ultimate doom/transformation. The chain Gleipnir, its forgers from the depths of Svartalvheim and Fenris - the chained jotun-wolf are some of the most important themes on the album, on which also the lyrics are sung in Norwegian and Old Norse tongue. Produced and engineered in Norway by Kvitrafn and released in April 2006 through Satanas Rex, a newly formed subdivision of legendary noise imprint Cold Spring. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jotunspor">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
