Tao Menizoo plays in a metal style melting strong power-metal influences with thrash/death accents, a mix called modern-thrash by some reviewers.
The band adds an industrial-music touch (loops, samples) and use atmospheric scenes, all of this supporting a deathcore-like leading voice.
After the line-up has changed twice (2 different singers), the band is now set-up, since 2000, with the actual hard core of its line-up : KSH (drums), RNN (bass), TTF (guitar and second voice) and LH (guitar and leading voice).
A first album, released in March 2003, has been given a very good welcome from european and international reviewers, but sadly, it did not get the distribution it deserved.
From september 2003 to february 2005, the work with Sir Hill, in charge of synths, backing vocals, percussion and samples, led the band to a richer music as a live and studio experience.
In 2006 and 2007, back to its core line-up, the band is working on its second album, recorded, mixed and produced in its own project-studio.
