SHADOWS THEORY was born in 2004 with the aspiration of making progressive metal. In the beginning the band’s instrumental lineup was drums, guitar and bass, and later it was included a keyboard. During this instrumental period you can notice 70s hard rock influence in the track “Artillería” and their evolution to progressive metal in “Génesis”. After the band’s hard and endless starting years, and after finding a definitive keyboardist, they decided to include vocal tracks in their repertoire with the intention of getting closer to more audience. The song “I am” is their first composition with lyrics and tries to show the rough path walked until then. A few years later, after writing more vocal tracks and after many vocalist changes, in 2011 Shadows Theory records it’s firs EP, Kaleidosphere, with its’s definitive singer. This experimental disc tries to show the different ways of seeing music and the band’s members lifes with a widely varied track compilation. In Kaleidosphere you can find hard rock elements as well as oriental music, heavy metal, orchestral symphonies and even an instrumental ballad, all of this always from a progressive point of view which never leaves the band.
