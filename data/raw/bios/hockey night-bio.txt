Hockey Night were a band from St Paul, Minnesota, USA. 

According to the band's MySpace page, they sound like "nonstop mind-zap melodies. superhooks and shimmery light-tones. harmonized dual guitars ride atop innertubes. watery vocal jams dripping hooks and glops. giant folk choruses and late evening wood-flutes. fire and echos, blazing over glistening drum shots and slippery hits. then solo becomes eagle-mind soaring above EarthRiver while fizzy throat hums. return to melody."

Others have noted the similarities to lo-fi legends Pavement, and the shambling, playful melodies and lyrical literacy indeed bring to mind the brighter side of Malkmus & Co. 

The band's first release, Rad Zapping, was released in 2002, followed by Keep Guessin' in 2005.

On May 8, 2007, Paul Sprangers released a statement to the website Daytrotter, announcing the dissolution of the band.  "It was a long time coming," the statement read. "I realized I didn’t want to continue on the way we were going. We were operating under that indie rock idea where it was fun and everybody’s buddies. We just want to do it right and we couldn’t get things done."

In 2009 it was revealed that Scott Wells and Paul Sprangers had formed a new band together in Philadelphia called Free Energy. They are signed to DFA Records. 

Via blog posts on both Hockey Night and Free Energy Myspace pages, they promised "more news, shows, a limited dfa 7" single, videos, mockumentary, recipes, safety tips, sound legal advice, sure bets, and where to go for the best deals."
