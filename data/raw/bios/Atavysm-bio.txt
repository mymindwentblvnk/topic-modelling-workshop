The name Atavysm comes from the word Atavism, which means "evolutionary throwback" in biological terms. 
"Resurgent atavism" is a common name for the belief that people in the modern era are beginning to revert to ways of thinking and acting that are throwbacks to a former time. The neo-pagan subculture also uses this same terminology to describe how modern, Western countries are experiencing both the decline of Christianity and the rise of religious movements inspired by the pagan religions of centuries past. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Atavysm">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
