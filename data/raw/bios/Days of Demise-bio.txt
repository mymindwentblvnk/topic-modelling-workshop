Somewhere in the autumn of 2001, bass player Sam and drummer Pieter started talking about music and their instruments. Soon the idea was growing of starting up a band. After a little while, a guitar player and a singer were found. They started rehearsing enthusiasticly.. but after the first rehearsal the two people decided not to go with Sam and Pieter, because of too much difference in musical styles. A fresh start had to be taken..

A few weeks later, two replacements were found, Robin and Karel, both guitar players. This time styles matched and Days of Demise came to a real start. The four made some songs, and mid-2003 they thought the time was right to find a singer. Dieter was called in.

A demo was recorded in Karel's garage, with that the opportunity to gig got bigger. At 21 February 2004 the first gig took place in Bellegem. A few followed, until Dieter decided to quit singing for Days of Demise. Soon already a new singer was found: Steven. He was showing lots of enthusiasm to get along with the band, as happened, after a while of rehearsing with the new singer Days of Demise was ready to go again.

Unfortunately, Sam decided to quit the band in November 2004, so a new bass player was needed. Thomas was contacted, and in just a few rehearsals, he was able to play all the DOD songs. Now Days of Demise could start where they had quit 10 months earlier, back to gigging!

December 2006, Pieter leaves the band. He wants to focus more on his other funk/soul project, Brothers On The Run. Another big loss for the band. At this point, Steve takes over the drums and Days Of Demise searches another singer. Cis Vansteenberge was called upon and the band was complete again, still thrashing the metal scene!

And the story continues..
