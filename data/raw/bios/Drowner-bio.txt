There are multiple artists by the name Drowner

1. Drowner is a band from Houston, Texas whose big, oceanic, atmospheric sound draws on influences as varied as shoegaze, post rock, noise pop and dream pop as well as bands like The Cure, R.E.M., My Bloody Valentine and Mogwai. Drowner is Darren Emanuel on guitar/keys, Sean Evans on guitar, Mike Brewer on bass and Anna Bouchard on vocals.

Drowner's debut EP has been expanded and re-released as a 10 track mini album. You can find it in the following stores:

In late 2010 Anna and Darren began writing in their respective studios and sending demos and tracks back and forth via the internet. In January, recording began and continued into March. The E.P. was recorded and mixed in Darren’s Houston studio using a mix of both digital and analog recording techniques. The barn structure that houses the studio contributed a warmth that became part of the band’s sound as the songs developed. The guitars on the E.P. are layer upon layer drenched in fuzzed out reverb and delay from an old Roland Space Echo. On tracks like “Point Dume” and “Wildflowers” Anna’s dramatic vocals are stacked up to 40 layers deep. The result is a sound that embodies the power of music to overwhelm and transcend. In late 2011, Sean Evans and Mike Brewer brought their respective talents on guitar and bass to the group, and the band was signed to the Saint Marie Records label.

Drowner is in the studio recording their first full length for Saint Marie Records, due out in late Spring 2012.
