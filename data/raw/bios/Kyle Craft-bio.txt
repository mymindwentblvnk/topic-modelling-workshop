Kyle Craft is a singer-songwriter who grew up in a tiny Louisiana town on the banks of the Mississippi, where he spent most of his time catching alligators and rattlesnakes instead of playing football or picking up the guitar. A self-described transient, Kyle Craft finally settled down in Portland, Oregon in 2015 after a three-year courtship with the Rose City. Touring through town led to frequent visits, couch surfing, and now full-time residency; and by all accounts, he's fully embraced his new home. That's where he recorded his debut album, Dolls Of The Highland, working with Brandon Summers and Benjamin Weikel of The Helio Sequence on the mixing process, and caught the eye of the legendary Seattle-based label Sub Pop. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kyle+Craft">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
