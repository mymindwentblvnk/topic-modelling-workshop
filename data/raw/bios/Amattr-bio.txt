Forged from wood and sound as the leaves were turning, Amattr is the brainchild of the guitarist known simply as Vidarr the Terrible. He made a New Years Resolution to make an album by the end of the year. After failing at writing more material for a Hard Rock or Power Metal album, Vidarr turned to his new favorite genre: Stoner Metal.

Drawing on his grassroots influences of Led Zeppelin and Early Black Sabbath and new influences from The Sword, Fu Manchu, and other various Stoner and Doom bands, Vidarr has created a sound that dances around the genres of Stoner Metal/Rock and Doom. Sometimes he lovingly calls it Doom Rock.

Black Dawn will be the first example of this. Vidarr is a heavy believer in telling a story through music, and will draw you in to the Post-Apocalyptic world of Black Dawn following our nameless hero as he tries to make it to the only sliver of civilization left west of the Rocky Mountains.

Projects also in the works are:
- VMX: A tale about a more fictional gangland LA, inspired by an RPG community.
- Fire in the Sky: The prequel to Black Dawn
