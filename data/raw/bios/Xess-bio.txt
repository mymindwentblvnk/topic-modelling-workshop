The band XESS was formed in Kaunas (second largest city in Lithuania) in 2001 after the gothic metal/rock (later cyber metal) band Liunuosna broke apart. During five years of their existence, XESS were twice confirmed as the best band of Lithuanian gothic/darkwave scene. The band has also performed on local TV shows. Their first self-released MCD “In Cyber Lust” (presented in Latvia, 2002) contained roughly processed synthetic dance metal.

After some time the sound of XESS started to change piece by piece. The sound of drums and guitars became more heavier and the whole atmosphere darker. In the end of 2005 the band self-released the second album - “Psychoholic Bastard Crew”.

Now the main core of the band - Beska, Shatras and Blakulla - is working on their 3rd album, which will be full of gothic rock, thrash metal and industrial elements. XESS musicians are also actively taking (and also did that before) parts in other bands and projects, like Dreamland Poetry, Mano Juodoji Sesuo, Angis, Anapilis or Siela.

On the stage XESS plays 2 guitars, bass, 2 vocals and live drummer.
