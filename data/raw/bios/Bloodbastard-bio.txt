In the winter of 2002 a new metal band was born
from the ashes of ‘Lost Euphoria’ (doom metal).
Sander B., Patrick and Sander V. continued and started playing an aggressive mix of death/hardcore/grind with horror/gore lyrics and without any fancy nonsense.

The rehearsal-shed was built in the area where a local tragedy took place between 1835 and 1847. Several dreadful murders were committed by a poet-worker and three of his sons known as ‘the Bloodbastards’….

Aggressive and intense vocals meet powerful, down-tuned and catchy riffs with pounding drumming. Bloodbastard plays bloodsoaked death/hardcore/grind songs which will stay on your mind forever!
