January 2011, three guys and their cheap instruments get together in a garage in St-Bruno, Lac-St-Jean. Karl Fortin (drums), Christopher Treamblay (guitar) and Bryan Bergeron (vocals) name the group Krystalyan.
Other musicians are to join the band, but it is only in 2014 that Krystalyan finds the right combination. Yannick Tremblay (guitar) and Raymond Werugia (bass) take their place beside the original three musicians to form what is the current official lineup. 
Krystalyan takes the stage next to world renouned bands such as The Faceless, Rings of Saturn,The Agonist, Beyond Creation, Erhima, Threat Signal, Fallujah and Black Crown Initiate before deciding to record their first album. In august 2015, ''Undefined'' (mixed and mastered by Marc-Andr√© Tremblay) is released and so far it has received a warm reception, spreading to many countries. 
The band is currently working on their second album and <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Krystalyan">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
