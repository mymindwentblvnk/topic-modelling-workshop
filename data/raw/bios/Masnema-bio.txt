October 2008 began a journey of the MASNEMA in construction. People came and went revolving around the powerhouse that was deemed “The Tripod”. Founding members, bass player Joel Stewart, guitarist Branden Blank-and-shit and drummer Kyle Mayhew established a strong bond that carried them till late 2010 when MASNEMA went though the most pivotal line up change yet. Kyles life had taken him further from the band leading in his disbandment and local artists Aaron Johnson and Josh Peters joined the roster. Together they formed the new sound that has branded MASNEMA a Ypsi Metal Heavyweight.
