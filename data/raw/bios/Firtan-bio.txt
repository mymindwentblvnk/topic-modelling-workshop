Firtan was founded by Phillip Thienger, Martin Lindner and Neves Sänger in the beginning of 2010 in South Germany. Linda Biermann and Oliver König joined at the end of 2010 to complete the bands lineup and Firtan started to work on a Demo, but never released it. In August 2011 Neves Sänger had to leave the band, because of differences with other band members and was replaced by Simon Philipp. Firtan will release their first EP "Wogen der Trauer" in January 2013. The band name comes from the old high german language and means "profane" or "wicked".
The music can be mainly described as a mix between Pagan Metal and Black Metal, but also contains elements of Folk and Melodic Death Metal. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Firtan">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
