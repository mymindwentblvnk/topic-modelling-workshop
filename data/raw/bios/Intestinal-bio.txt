Intestinal is a death metal band from Östergötlands län, Sweden formed in 2008, who released their debut LP Human Harvest in February 2010 through Psycho Records.

Intestinal belongs to the current stylistic revival of the 'old school death metal' sound.  As such, their debut album was reviewed as exhibiting demo-like production and muscular, "riff-centric" songwriting.  By their subject material, featuring songs with titles such as "Licking a Dead Cunt," "Bloodsplatter," and "Skinripped Whore," they present gore and death themes common of the genre.

In July 2011, the band announced a new album titled "The Rottening" was in the mixing process, copies of which are to be sold during dates of the band's autumn schedule -- a tour exclusive to Sweden. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Intestinal">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
