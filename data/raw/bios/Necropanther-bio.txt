Necropanther was formed in 2014 with the simple goal of creating heavy music and playing shows that thrill audiences. The band was created through a merger of two previous bands. Guitarist Paul Anop and bassist Kyle Hupp from Kansas (Spirit of the Stairs) joined with drummer Haakon Sjogren and guitarist Joe Johnson from Denver (Moore).

Featuring short, hooky songs, Necropanther has quickly become a favorite in the highly competitive Denver metal scene with their precision, speed and tight shows.
