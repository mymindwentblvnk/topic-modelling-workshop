BIRTH THROUGH GORE was created in 2007 by Paschalis Tassioudis , Aggelos HSR and Nick . Before Birth Through Gore Paschalis Guitars, Nick Bass, Thomas Bairaktaris Lead Guitar Vocals , John Aghoul Drums and Aggelos Vocals (former Obscence) were all involved in the Death Metal Underground Band EVADE (1999-2007), with years of delivering pure Death Metal pleasure to our brothers in Thessaloniki.

In 2009 we contacted our good friends ERECTUS and their guitarist Stealth, to start, as our sound engineer and everything for the sound man, record our debut album "Reign Of Depravity". With excellent production and pounding sound on March 2009 we were ready . John ''Rem3dy'' Nakos from the Brutal Death Metal band MORTAL TORMENT who has created art for bands such as Devourment and Prostitute Disfigurement made the album covers. After we came in contact with Sevared Records we decided that , as of 2012 our first album will be released through this highly recognized Record Label and Distribution!

Regardless the difficulties in our paths throughout these years We are dedicated in stretching our limits of creating music further.
