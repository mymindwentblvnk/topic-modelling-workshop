The Sight Below is a techno/shoegaze/ambient act from Seattle, Washington. Its main member is American post-classical composer  Rafael Anton Irisarri.

Sam Valenti IV signed The Sight Below to his Ghostly International imprint in 2008 after listening to a demo tape. A promotional EP No Place For Us was soon released by the label as a free MP3 download on August 26, 2008.

The Sight Below debuted its live set at Seattle's KEXP radio station on September 20, 2008. The in-studio session was recorded and is available on Ghostly's website as a podcast (GhostlyCast #18). 
A well-received performance followed at the Ghostly International showcase during Decibel Festival. These performances paved the way for an extensive European tour that saw the artist perform at 18 different cities in the continent, including Unsound Festival in Krakow, Poland, EME Festival in Lisbon, Portugal, S.O.Y. Festival in Nantes, France and TimeZones Festival in Bari, Italy.

The Sight Below's full-length debut album Glider was released in the United States on November 2008 and January 2009 worldwide. It is available as both a physical and digital release. The album was very well-received by the press and music community, including praise from Radiohead's Thom Yorke, who charted "At First Touch" on his January 6, 2009 "Office Chart" posting on the band's website Dead Air Space.

Originally, the identity of the artist was concealed, wanting to avoid being pigeonholed given his previous solo output on the Norwegian Miasmah label.

The Sight Below is releasing a new album for Ghostly, which will feature music written with former Slowdive member Simon Scott. It is entitled It All Falls Apart, set for release on April 6, 2010. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Sight+Below">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
