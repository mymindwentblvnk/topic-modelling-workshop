Kitchen Knife Conspiracy formed in 1998 in Youngstown, Ohio. Influenced by Obituary, Crowbar, Pantera, Six Feet Under, Soulfly, Sepultura, Faith No More and countless others--KKC is a hard group to classify.

Death metal? Kinda.
Hardcore? Kinda.
Porn rock? Definitely.


But since 1998, KKC's mission has stayed the same--have the stomp to be memorable and catchy, while keeping the abrasiveness to be destined to stay deeply rooted in the underground. Just the list of bands Kitchen Knife Conspiracy has performed with shows the wide range of possibilities:

Crowbar, Internal Bleeding, Six Feet Under, King Diamond, Crowbar, Today is the Day, Soilent Green, Mushroomhead, Dog Fashion Disco, Full Blown Chaos, Nile, Mortician, Agents of Oblivion, Bongzilla, NDE and many more, both national and local.
