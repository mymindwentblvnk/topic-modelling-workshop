Saattue - meaning procession in Finnish - started their journey in 2001. The band released their first self-financed EP "Kivisydän" in 2004 and it's follow up EP release "Ikiuneen" in 2006. In 2007 the band got signed by Spikefarm Records, who released Saattue's debut album "Jäähyvästi” in January 2008. Saattue's second full-length album "Vuoroveri" will be released on 21st of October 2009.

In their music Saattue combine their native language Finnish to dark, raw and emotional musical elements. Saattue's roots are deeply in doom metal and other extreme metal genres, but they've also gathered influences from dark rock groups, such as the Finnish cult rock act Mana Mana.

Typical trademarks of the Saattue-sound are oppressive heaviness, rawness, atmospheric passages and ear-catching chorus melodies. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Saattue">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
