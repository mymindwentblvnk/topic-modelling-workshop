Futures End is a Californian progressive metal band formed by guitarists Christian Wentz and Marc Pattison.

Once their first few demos were completed, Fred Marshall, formerly of progressive metal band Zero Hour, was chosen to be their vocalist. Shortly thereafter, bass legend Steve DiGiorgio (Death, Iced Earth) and drummer Jon Allen (Testament, Sadus) came on board to complete Futures End.

The bandâ€™s debut album, Memoirs of a Broken Man, was released in 2009 under Nightmare Records to considerable critical acclaim. That same year, their album was voted 'Best Progressive Metal Album of 2009' in USA Progressive Music Magazine's annual poll, beating Redemption, Shadow Gallery, Edgend, and progressive metal giants Dream Theater. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Futures+End">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
