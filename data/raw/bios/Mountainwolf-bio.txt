Mountainwolf is a blues inspired experimental rock band from based out of Annapolis, MD. The group has been providing the area with psychedelic rock since early 2013. Their first live appearances were made at a DIY house venue in the heart of Annapolis known as Satan’s Circus, founded by Mountainwolf’s guitarist, Tyler Vaillant. Satan’s Circus quickly gained attention in the area, but was unfortunately shut down in mid 2013. Determined to keep the momentum of Mountainwolf alive, the band continued to play shows around Annapolis and has since expanded to Baltimore and surrounding cities. To date, they have 3 releases; a 6-son ep titled "The Wolf Dance" in 2012, a 5-song ep titled "#mountainwolf" in 2013, and a full length titled "The Silk Road" in 2015. All 3 releases are available at http://mountainwolf.bandcamp.com For more information, visit http://mountainwolfmusic.com or https://www.facebook.com/mountainwolfmd/  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mountainwolf">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
