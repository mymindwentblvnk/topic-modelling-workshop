Hailing from Nova Scotia, Canada and formed from the ashes of Collapse, Hate Division lash out with savage deathgrind against political/religious hypocrites and the mainstream in general.Taking the basic elements of bands like Dying Fetus/Crowbar and other intense acts, these guys get their point across like a defiant fist upside your head.Sean Wyszynski has quite the vox happening here with his signature growl, while Shane Forsyth (who also handles drum duites) goes for the higher screams like the classic Steer/Walker vocal assault.Rounding out the line-up are Paul Shaw, who's punkmetal background is a killer addition to the band on bass; and finally Howie Young churning out quite the memorable riffage.Just releasing their debut four song ep a couple months ago, this band is already nearing completion of the writing process for their first full length.
