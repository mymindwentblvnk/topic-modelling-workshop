3. Curtis William Carter III was born in Houston, Texas and more recently resides in Los Angeles, California. His interest in music sparked as a young man growing up in Houston. "In Houston, rap is a culture…it was a custom to freestyle over other rappers' beats …You could go anywhere and say "bust a flow" and people would huddle up and just freestyle. It was recreational, boys girls--everybody would get into it. That planted the seeds.."  He grew up listening to Outkast, UGK, Jay-Z, 3-6 Mafia, Nelly, 2pac. Watching Houston rappers like Chamillionaire and Slim Thug before they were famous, he saw them grow from start to now. It helped him understand different aspects of lyrics and poetry in a way he could understand which made for good reference with his own raps. He is a man who wears many hats and surrounds himself with like-minded, ambitious individuals who have already made a name for themselves. He is involved in all aspects of his music, as he understands what it takes to establish his musical ethos. . "My vision is to promote substance and authenticity through my music to be the voice for the people who relate and believe in me and what I do."
