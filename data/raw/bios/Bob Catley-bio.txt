Bob Catley (born 11 September 1947), is the lead singer with British rock band Magnum and a solo artist in his own right.  He is widely considered to be one of the best singers in the melodic rock genre, and is known for his rich, distinctive voice and ability to convey emotion.

Catley has started his musical career in band Magnum (founded in 1972). Following Magnum's demise in 1995 and the short-lived Hard Rain project, Catley joined up with Ten vocalist and songwriter Gary Hughes to release the album The Tower (1997), shortly followed by the supporting live album Live At The Gods (1997).  Hughes again wrote the material for 1999's Legends release, and the critically acclaimed concept album Middle Earth (2001), which was inspired by J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings.

Despite rejoining Magnum following their reformation in 2002, Catley has continued his solo career with keyboardist Paul Hodson writing and producing 2003's When Empires Burn, his heaviest solo release to date.  His latest solo album, Spirit Of Man (2006) saw yet another change in songwriting as Dave Thompson and Paul Uttley of Lost Weekend, and Vince O'Regan of Pulse did the honours.

As well as his career with Magnum and as a solo artist, Catley has lent his vocal talents to other projects by such artists as Clive Nolan and Oliver Wakeman, Gary Hughes, Ayreon and Tobias Sammett of Edguy (Avantasia).

Magnum's latest album, Princess Alice & The Broken Arrow was released in 2007 to excellent reviews and Catley has announced plans to record a new solo album towards the end of the year, set for release in 2008. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Catley">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
