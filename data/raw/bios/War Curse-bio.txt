Formed in 2013 by guitarists Justin Roth, Joshua Murphy, and drummer James Goetz, War Curse has become a new prominent force in thrash metal. Like many bands facing the harsh realities of life and relationships, War Curse has endured a handful of line up changes since itâ€™s inception. In 2016 War Curse added some serious firepower and experience to the line up with the addition of ex Grip Inc / current Heathen bassist Jason VieBrooks. In 2017 the line up was once again complete with Blaine Gordon assuming the role of vocalist and frontman.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/War+Curse">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
